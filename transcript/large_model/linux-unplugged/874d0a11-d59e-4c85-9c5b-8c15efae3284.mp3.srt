1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,020
Rumor has it Mr. Bacon has himself some new hardware.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:03,860
I do indeed.

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,400
I recently got in my new Pine Book Pro.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,240
That's exciting.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,680
Yeah, it's an interesting little machine.

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,840
I haven't had a lot of time to play with it yet,

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,480
but I will say that out of all the delivery drivers,

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,560
the DHL guy seems to be the most courteous.

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,400
Yeah.

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,920
Like he gave me a nice little knock on the door.

11
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,440
He didn't like cop knock the door or anything.

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,680
He actually knocked.

13
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,280
Mike gave me a big hug the other day.

14
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,840
Just a big old hug.

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,140
This geeky also just got your Pine Book?

16
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,440
Yeah, the DHL guy bought it this morning.

17
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,640
Did you give him a hug?

18
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,660
I didn't get a hug from him,

19
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,280
but he did comment that his wife had the same car as me,

20
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,120
but that was about it.

21
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,240
That's your move right there.

22
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,080
That's the window.

23
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,560
I mean, he's asking for a hug.

24
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,160
That's what it seemed like to me.

25
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,640
You had a delightful DHL delivery man as well.

26
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,880
That's great.

27
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,920
Yeah, it was great.

28
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,760
Ha ha ha.

29
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,760
Oh, hello friends and welcome into the Unplugged program.

30
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,600
My name is Chris.

31
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,440
My name is Wes.

32
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,260
Well, hello, Wes.

33
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,100
Hello.

34
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,600
Who brought this big show?

35
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,440
I think you did.

36
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,280
Yeah, I think you did.

37
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,440
Uh-oh, someone did.

38
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,160
Maybe it was a team effort.

39
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,320
High five, Wes.

40
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,480
Ha ha ha.

41
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,920
We have so much to talk about today.

42
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,600
In the community news, there's new hardware,

43
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,320
there's new software, and there's things to discuss.

44
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,440
And then we're gonna give follow-up thoughts

45
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,440
on Fedora 31, as well as the release of Fedora 21.

46
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,520
Follow-up thoughts on Fedora 31, as well as,

47
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,040
we'll be joined by a special guest in the Fedora 31 section

48
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,560
to talk about some of the underpinnings

49
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,080
of the Fedora operating system,

50
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,240
as well as what's coming up in 32 and 33.

51
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,360
There's a lot to look forward to.

52
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,740
Yeah, it's really something.

53
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,240
But there's much more than that as well,

54
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,840
including the picks and the housekeeping.

55
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,160
And our community, let's start off

56
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,480
by saying hello to Cheese and Alex.

57
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,300
Hey guys.

58
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,140
Hello there.

59
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,120
Hello internet.

60
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,200
Oh hi.

61
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh hi, don't say hi to me, that's fine.

62
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,840
It's just me.

63
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,760
I thought you spoke for the internet.

64
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,160
I do now, Wes.

65
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,880
Also, speaking of the internet,

66
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,420
we have our virtual log time appropriate greetings.

67
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,260
Mumble room.

68
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,100
Hello.

69
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,920
What's up?

70
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,800
Good evening.

71
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,600
Well, hello, hello.

72
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,800
It's nice to see all of you.

73
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,260
I see, of course, let's see.

74
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,600
Let's lean into this one here, Wes.

75
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,680
I'm gonna say, Ace Nomad.

76
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,520
You got it.

77
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,040
I thought you were gonna mess it up on that time.

78
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,400
No, it's not Acne Nomad.

79
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,360
No, it's Ace Nomad.

80
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,200
Not this week, anyway.

81
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,360
The one, the only Brent photo.

82
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,200
Hello, Brent.

83
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,020
Oh, hey there.

84
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,680
Mr. Bitebitten, good to see you as always.

85
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,520
Hello.

86
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,880
Carl, every time I see you, I just get hungry.

87
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,900
Good to see you, Carl.

88
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,740
I'm hungry too.

89
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,400
Good man.

90
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,000
Cassidy's here from Elementary OS.

91
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,840
Hey Cassidy.

92
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,660
Hey Cassidy.

93
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,880
And the one, the only, Mr. Dan the Rabbit,

94
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,840
one of my favorite podcasters in the universe.

95
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,680
Hey, Dan.

96
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,520
Heyo.

97
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,340
Heyo.

98
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,180
How about that?

99
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,020
Anne Frank's here.

100
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,840
Hello, Frank.

101
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,680
Hello, Mini Mac.

102
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,520
Hello.

103
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,360
Hello.

104
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,880
And this geek, Anne, coming in, right in,

105
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,160
as I'm calling out names.

106
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,640
Hello, Mr. Martin Wimpress.

107
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,480
Hey Wimpy.

108
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,960
Hello there, just in the nick of time then.

109
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,080
Yes, good job.

110
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,200
You got the shout out.

111
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Good to see you as well.

112
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,880
Well, we have a lot to get into this week,

113
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,280
so let's get started.

114
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,400
We, I think, need to acknowledge yet another milestone

115
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,980
for our beloved desktop.

116
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,400
This week, Dell has really increased their range

117
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,680
of selection of hardware for their preloaded systems

118
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,080
with Ubuntu.

119
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,000
Their XPS 13 line has gone from like two or three options

120
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,480
to something damn near 18 options now,

121
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,980
depending on how you configure it.

122
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,880
This is big, Wes.

123
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,680
This is like, Dell goes big on Linux,

124
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,060
and they're betting on this developer workstation.

125
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,560
It has felt like, I mean, just more and more configurations,

126
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,520
and you've seen some of the precision line as well.

127
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,520
It's clearly doing well enough, they're

128
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,480
willing to continue to invest.

129
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,520
And I like having a lot of different Linux laptops

130
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,320
to choose from.

131
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,760
Yeah, this is a large range, from systems

132
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,920
with four cores, six cores, 1804 pre-installed.

133
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,760
Also, more Wi-Fi options than I ever expected them.

134
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,000
That's an area I didn't expect.

135
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,280
And actually paying attention to Wi-Fi and Linux,

136
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,120
playing nicely together, that's always good.

137
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,360
I'd love to see more than 16 gigs of RAM.

138
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,000
Would love to see that.

139
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,960
But these are beautiful systems with that gorgeous Infinity

140
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,000
Edge display.

141
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,680
I think I really have enjoyed using my T480,

142
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,960
and I really do like a ThinkPad for work.

143
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,560
But if I could be fancy enough to own multiple Linux

144
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,720
high-end laptops, my T480 would be my work laptop,

145
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,360
and an XPS 13 would be the laptop I buy for myself.

146
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,440
It just feels kind of friendly and approachable.

147
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,920
It's light.

148
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,400
You can throw it on the couch and not worry about it.

149
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:38,960
Yeah.

150
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,000
So how's the trackpad?

151
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,080
Because the benchmark, in my opinion, of trackpads

152
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,160
is or was the MacBook glass trackpad.

153
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,440
ThinkPad trackpads are definitely a step down from that.

154
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,960
Where does the XPS fit in that kind of hierarchy?

155
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,640
So I think it depends on what ThinkPad you have as

156
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,960
to the quality of the trackpad.

157
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,560
So my ThinkPad has got a glass trackpad, and it's very good.

158
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,240
And now I have a MacBook Pro, albeit a 2015 model.

159
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,440
I can make an objective comparison.

160
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,040
And certainly, the MacBook Pro is better,

161
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,800
but probably it's better because the gesture support is just

162
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
so much better.

163
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,800
And I would say that the XPS, I've got a XPS 15

164
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,840
and a couple of XPS 13s.

165
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,160
Their trackpad is as good as you can

166
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,000
get for a Microsoft Precision trackpad,

167
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,520
but it's still not to the level that the MacBook trackpads are.

168
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,640
Yeah, that's basically my assessment as well.

169
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,320
I thought it might be fun if I configured

170
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,520
one of these new XPS systems.

171
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,200
I think I'm going to go.

172
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,400
I think I used to hold back on 4K.

173
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,520
I think you're ready now.

174
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
Oh, well, the desktop's kind of caught up.

175
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,120
Yeah.

176
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,880
It's not me, Wes.

177
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,960
I've been ready.

178
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,600
My body's been ready for a long time.

179
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,520
I think Wimpy's ready.

180
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,360
That's what it is.

181
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,520
Yeah, if Wimpy could get Mate together.

182
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,360
No, actually, that's actually my point,

183
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
is things are getting to be in pretty good shape

184
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,600
on high DPI now.

185
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:13,520
$1,499.99 is my config.

186
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,160
What's with me?

187
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,360
Am I so much of a fancy boy?

188
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,080
But even that, that's not that bad.

189
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,240
If it's going to, you know, I mean,

190
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,080
you're going to keep it for three, four years.

191
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,520
Well, let me tell you what you get.

192
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,880
So for 1,500 US greenbacks, you get 16 gigabytes of DDR3 RAM,

193
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:34,520
a 13.3 inch 4K 3840 by 2160 Infinity Edge touch display,

194
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,360
512 gigabyte PCIe mVini drive, which is fast as hell,

195
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,800
killer Wi-Fi, which is pretty damn good,

196
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,280
and actually really good Wi-Fi matters to me,

197
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,480
and a 52 watt hour battery for sale.

198
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,520
$1,500 for something that is also

199
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,760
putting a vote towards shipping something with Linux preloaded

200
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,440
that is a nice tight package that I have now

201
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,360
owned two different generations of XPSs,

202
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,480
so I know they're good stuff.

203
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,200
Yeah, I think that's a fair price.

204
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,440
I actually thought I'd come out here and say it was too much,

205
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,160
but now going through it, I think it's actually fair.

206
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,360
Right.

207
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
I mean, it's not the best, and you unfortunately

208
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,720
can't quite seem to get everything all in one package.

209
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,160
It'd be nice to have more RAM or a little more configurable

210
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,440
or horsepower in there.

211
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,920
But it's a really shiny Linux laptop

212
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,520
that you're not ashamed to bring into any environment.

213
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,520
And you know, it's just going to keep getting better.

214
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,320
So if you invest now, we can look forward

215
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,280
to more good things.

216
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,760
To that note, Wes, I tweeted at Barton George this week

217
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,600
saying if it was 32 gig, it would probably

218
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,560
be an instant buy from me.

219
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,600
And he and several other people on Twitter

220
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,400
were very responsive, I've got to say.

221
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,000
So I think if the more people can tweet Dell

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,600
and say that we want more RAM, it

223
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,400
sounds to me like it might happen one day.

224
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,080
For now, they're pointing people at the Precision line.

225
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,640
But I don't think it's an impossibility,

226
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,320
because that 10th gen chip that's in there, the CPU,

227
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,560
does support up to 64 gigs.

228
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,680
I guess it's just a case of finding somewhere to fit

229
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,920
the other chips on the board.

230
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,360
Right, yeah, updating the platform to include it.

231
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,000
Or the power usage.

232
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,120
Oh, yeah, could be that.

233
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,720
Yeah, I recently reviewed a Precision 3540,

234
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,480
which was pre-installed with Ubuntu on the Ubuntu podcast.

235
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,160
And I have to say, they had to wrestle that laptop back off

236
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,660
me.

237
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,880
I absolutely loved it.

238
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,160
Yeah, you did.

239
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,120
And that one, you can put 64 gigs in.

240
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,680
OK, well, so I'm the guy that has

241
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,520
systems with 32 gigabytes of RAM.

242
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,680
But I'm also going to play devil's advocate here

243
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,480
for a moment.

244
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,040
This morning, as I was using my workstation,

245
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,120
and my mouse was chopping across the screen

246
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,920
like it was a system from 1992, I

247
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,920
really wondered if it was worth having 64 gigabytes of RAM.

248
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,280
And I thought about, if an audience member came to me

249
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,800
and said, I have a limited budget,

250
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,440
what's the most I should spend on RAM,

251
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,240
I think I would have to advise them 16 gigs.

252
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,200
Because performance on Linux starts

253
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,880
to shit the bed way before you use up all your memory.

254
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,960
Now, if you have 4 gigabytes of RAM or 2 gigabytes of RAM.

255
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,880
Yeah, 16 is pretty comfortable these days.

256
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,320
I mean, I've got 32 right here, and I have 28 available.

257
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,480
I can bring my fairly high-end system down

258
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,200
to a laggy desktop mess by simply playing a YouTube video

259
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,640
and browsing the web and loading other web pages

260
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,640
while I have a couple of chat applications

261
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,800
going in a terminal.

262
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,920
And I'm sitting there using 5 gigs of RAM,

263
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,040
so I've got literally 59 gigabytes of RAM unused.

264
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,600
So it's not a memory thing.

265
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,140
So I think we've got other problems

266
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,720
we have to solve before we really address the memory.

267
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,320
Not all desktops experience this issue, I grant you.

268
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,720
But it was a little disappointing,

269
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,240
because I felt like I've gone to this.

270
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,520
When I built this system, I went to this effort

271
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,160
of separating out the disk I.O. So my scratch disk,

272
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,560
my home directory, my game disk, my operating system OS.

273
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,600
They're all on separate, very high-speed disks.

274
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,960
I got high-end graphics.

275
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,040
Like I said, 64 gigabytes of RAM, six CPU cores.

276
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,280
I thought, this will be the fastest computer I have ever

277
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,800
owned.

278
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,000
Just a machine you can work on and not

279
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,920
have to think about anything else.

280
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,120
I'll just crunch through it.

281
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,440
But screw me, because I open up YouTube in another tab

282
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,640
and then tab out while I read news stories

283
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,040
and scroll web pages, and my whole computer lags out.

284
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,040
And heaven forbid, something gets a little excessive

285
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,920
in Slack, like maybe an animated emoticon that really

286
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,080
pings one thread.

287
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,160
Because then, if I'm watching a video, browsing a web page,

288
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,880
and somebody's done something in Slack,

289
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,100
well, then my mouse jumps across my screen every few seconds.

290
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,360
It's just like a stuttering mess.

291
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,200
It's unusable, yeah.

292
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,240
So there's other problems.

293
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,160
Not to go there, but.

294
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,640
You know, I hear Linux runs great in a virtual machine.

295
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,800
Well, what I was going to say is,

296
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,320
maybe we should just hit the reset button

297
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,840
and switch to the ARM platform.

298
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,760
No, I mean, I know we'll get these things fixed up.

299
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,280
And I know it's the worst on Gnome Shell,

300
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,920
and that I'm really on the cutting edge,

301
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,020
and this is what you get.

302
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,160
So I put all that into perspective.

303
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,000
But I am very impressed in what we're seeing,

304
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,320
not just in the Pine Book, but also just from the Raspberry

305
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,280
Pi 4.

306
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,960
It is significantly more powerful than the Raspberry Pi

307
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,460
3.

308
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,680
It's definitely entered an interesting territory

309
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,040
of keeping up, being able to perform a number of tasks

310
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,800
that the previous gens just couldn't quite get to.

311
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,200
I have a significant number of things I'm using Raspberry Pi 4.

312
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,040
In fact, I go into some significant detail

313
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,880
in the self-hosted that comes out later this week.

314
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,560
But I haven't really seen any distro except for Raspbian

315
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,680
step up to the Raspberry Pi 4.

316
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,160
So that's why I was very happy to see a post on the ubuntu.com

317
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,240
blog on November 3 that talks about Canonical's plans

318
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,400
for support for the Raspberry Pi.

319
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,960
They write, with 1910's release of Ubuntu Server,

320
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,400
Canonical has announced official support for the Raspberry Pi

321
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,160
4.

322
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,080
The latest board from the Raspberry Pi Foundation

323
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,080
sports a faster system on a chip with a processor that uses

324
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,920
the Cortex A72 architecture.

325
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,800
Additionally, it offers up to four gigabytes of RAM.

326
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,680
We are supporting the Raspberry Pi 4

327
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,800
to give developers access to a low cost

328
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,760
board powerful enough to consolidate

329
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,160
compute workloads at the edge.

330
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,280
That sounds pretty great.

331
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,360
Unfortunately, they go on.

332
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,560
However, our official support for this board

333
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,560
is currently limited to the one gig and two gigabyte versions.

334
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,760
Due to a kernel bug, USB ports are not

335
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,320
supported out of the box in the official ARM64 image

336
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,560
on the four gigabyte version.

337
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,160
Kernel fixes have been identified

338
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,000
by Canonical engineers.

339
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,560
And we're currently testing these fixes extensively.

340
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,440
Yeah, I ran into this with my tester.

341
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,040
I talked about it a little bit during our 1910 review.

342
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,120
And I did discover, too, that if you limit the memory

343
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,080
to less than four gigs, or if you just simply

344
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,840
use the 32-bit image, it's fine.

345
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,600
But then it also turned out there was a KVM bug in there.

346
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,960
But they're getting pretty close to having this fixed.

347
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,280
And it's really kind of taking some work upstream,

348
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,480
as well as Canonical kind of keeping on top of it.

349
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,520
Right, it is kind of a reminder that these are

350
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,560
special, unique little devices, right?

351
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,640
And you might have good support running in Raspbian,

352
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,880
because they spend a lot of time getting that to work right.

353
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,120
And it takes a little longer for that to filter downstream.

354
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,720
Yeah.

355
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,920
It is kind of a core reminder that you can just

356
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,440
limit the amount of memory your system uses, too, in Linux.

357
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,400
It's just so easy and so cool.

358
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,720
That is really neat.

359
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
Wimby, do you have any insight into this process,

360
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,200
either for Ubuntu MATE or for a mainline Ubuntu LTS

361
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,160
or whichever?

362
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,920
Yeah, so the hardware enablement that's in 1910

363
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,240
will become the next point release for 1804.

364
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,080
So around that time, the Raspberry Pi 4 support

365
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,120
will roll into an 1804 version, as well.

366
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,040
Obviously, we want to get that bug fixed

367
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,040
where all of the USB ports go away unexpectedly.

368
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,360
And obviously, having a Raspberry Pi 4

369
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,600
with 4 gigs of RAM, that makes the 64-bit story a lot more

370
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,840
compelling there now.

371
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,760
So we want to get that right.

372
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,240
And then, of course, when 2004 comes around,

373
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,680
we'll have Ubuntu core images, as well,

374
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,960
for the entire family of Raspberry Pis.

375
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,400
It seems like a pretty serious commitment.

376
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,200
The quote here that I highlighted for our saving

377
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,320
is, canonical is dedicated to offering outstanding support

378
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,000
for the Raspberry Pi boards.

379
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,760
To achieve this objective, we are

380
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,080
listening to feedback from the community

381
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,960
and acting upon it to improve our delivery process.

382
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,320
We want Ubuntu to become even more compelling option

383
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,800
for an operating system on the Raspberry Pi boards.

384
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,160
Wow.

385
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,320
That seems like it's a pretty serious effort.

386
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,840
Yeah.

387
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,160
There's lots of people lined up behind this initiative.

388
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,800
Yeah.

389
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,480
It's nice to see.

390
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,120
I mean, nothing against Raspbian,

391
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,080
but it just feels so foreign.

392
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,200
You know, it's so specialized and localized.

393
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,920
And one of the things I love about using Linux

394
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,200
is I can use the same thing on the server, the desktop,

395
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,000
or on my little Pi platform, but it's not there yet.

396
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,080
Well, I feel like I'm the silly one right now that's saying,

397
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,960
you can use a Pi 4 in production?

398
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,840
And the thing that makes me the most

399
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,640
uneasy about that recommendation is Raspbian.

400
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,840
Nothing against the project.

401
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,400
So far, as I have used it, it seems

402
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,560
to be a great distribution, and I get why they make it.

403
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,720
However, when I have put so much effort

404
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,040
into building the perfect home setup,

405
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,040
and I'm sitting there doing an OS upgrade,

406
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,640
there is just a bit of confidence

407
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,840
I have when it's an operating system that

408
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,680
is a daily driver for me, like Ubuntu LTS.

409
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,560
And there's a lot to like about Ubuntu right now.

410
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,200
And I just have faith in its process to upgrade.

411
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,040
And I also know there's a certain scale factor that's

412
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,640
safe there.

413
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,240
But so far, Raspbian's been fine.

414
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,280
But I would be much happier running something

415
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,360
that I use on my other systems in production already.

416
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,620
And so I'd love to see this.

417
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,040
In the meantime, there is some workarounds for the bugs

418
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,920
until they're sorted.

419
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,680
But it's nice to see that the LTSs will be getting it.

420
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,220
In the future, there are ways you can do it,

421
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,320
but I wouldn't necessarily recommend them yet based

422
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,640
on my testing.

423
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,560
And the other thing I should just point out,

424
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,640
because it might not be obvious, but the images

425
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,200
we prepare for the Raspberry Pi are

426
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,560
subject to the same security maintenance

427
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,320
as every other Ubuntu version.

428
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,920
So kernel patches and libraries and everything,

429
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,200
all of that stuff in the Raspberry Pi images

430
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,480
moves at the same cadence as everything else.

431
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,680
Have you had a chance to play with the Raspberry Pi 4?

432
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,480
I have two of them on the desk behind me at the moment.

433
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,040
I am not blown away as a desktop.

434
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
They seem quite good as a desktop.

435
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,160
But I am legitimately impressed with what

436
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,440
they are capable as a headless Linux

437
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,080
box running home servers services.

438
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah, it's definitely a huge step up

439
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,440
from the Pi 3 and 3 Plus and that era of Raspberry Pi.

440
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,920
Every time these boards get revved,

441
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,480
I think people have expectations that are unrealistic.

442
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,300
If you follow the SOC developments closely,

443
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,560
you'll know that they're never going to compete

444
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:12,160
with contemporary Intel or AMD-based parts,

445
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,680
even at the lower power limits.

446
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,320
But I really quite like them.

447
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,400
I'm obviously working on Ubuntu MATE for the Raspberry Pi 4.

448
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,840
That'll probably be available sometime near Christmas.

449
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,280
So that's a fun project for me.

450
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,300
But I'm also, I've just got an arcade fighting stick

451
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,600
and I'm building a new emulation station system.

452
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,480
So I'm using the Pi 4 for that.

453
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,720
Oh, that's great.

454
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,680
You know, the only thing that really scuppers the Pi for me

455
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,760
at the moment, Pi 4 in particular,

456
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,640
is the SD card requirement.

457
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,440
I don't want to put something into production

458
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,960
that relies on an SD card.

459
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,100
Use a USB stick.

460
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,520
Can you boot from that, though?

461
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,600
No, not yet.

462
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,560
It's not available yet, but it will be coming.

463
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,320
Yeah.

464
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,560
I, on the other hand, I find SD cards pretty easy to manage.

465
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,840
Because, I mean, you're talking to a guy

466
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,960
who used to make custom boot floppies to play video games.

467
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,360
So I can duplicate them fairly straightforwardly.

468
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,680
They are of a reasonable cost.

469
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,240
And you can use them to just essentially bootstrap

470
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,440
the system and then use larger storage elsewhere.

471
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,800
It's a compromise at this point.

472
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
But I have faith that they'll get there.

473
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,640
You're right, though.

474
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,320
It is, I think, the way to put that, Alex.

475
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,560
It's definitely something to be aware of.

476
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,000
Because those things do have a certain endurance

477
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,480
and then they start to fail.

478
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,200
And that's a bad morning.

479
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,680
Wimpy, you've had a lot going on.

480
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,880
There's been some changes for you in life.

481
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
Probably a good time to mention that you recently

482
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,080
sat down for a brunch with Mr. Brent.

483
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,920
I did have a lovely brunch with Brent.

484
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,040
It was a high point of my week.

485
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,400
Extras.show slash 29.

486
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,480
I really enjoyed it.

487
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,280
Really, a really great episode.

488
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,360
And Brent, you just got to keep it up.

489
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,160
Because I learn more about folks when

490
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,840
they go on brunch with Brent than I would have otherwise.

491
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,400
It's like, you get there.

492
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,080
You know, you get down, you get deep.

493
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,160
You get the details.

494
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
Don't worry, it doesn't hurt at all.

495
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,080
Brent's very gentle.

496
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,000
Yeah, and it's delicious.

497
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,400
You know, I've been having a lot of fun with these chats.

498
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,040
And the chat with Wimpy, of course,

499
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,960
was a lot of fun while we were doing it.

500
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,160
And it sounds like a lot of people

501
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,200
are really enjoying it on their commutes and stuff like that.

502
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,840
So I'd say, if you enjoyed it, spread it widely.

503
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,360
Yeah.

504
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,280
And also, Wimpy, just congratulations.

505
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,200
I think it's, anyone who's been following your journey

506
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,520
on this show knows that it's a bit of a remarkable journey.

507
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,280
And now, here you are as the director of the Ubuntu Desktop

508
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,640
at Canonical, which is just incredible.

509
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,680
And some of that journey is talked about there

510
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,640
in that extra.

511
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,360
Yeah, and my time here, particularly on Linux Unplugged,

512
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,400
has been pivotal in getting to where I am today.

513
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,800
And I talked about that with Brent.

514
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,480
So if you're curious as to how all that unfolded,

515
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,240
that's one of the things we talked about.

516
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,080
But yeah, thank you for Linux Unplugged.

517
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,200
It really has had quite the profound impact on my life.

518
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,120
And it's always a joy for turning up.

519
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,920
Oh, stop.

520
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,200
No, no, stop it.

521
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
Thank you for being here.

522
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,320
Extras.show slash 29.

523
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,280
Go listen to that.

524
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,920
It's a great additional little thing

525
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,040
that you might call an extra.

526
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,440
You might just call it that.

527
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,600
Well, Cassidy and Dan from Elementary OS are here.

528
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,320
And I think this is the perfect opportunity for us

529
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,120
to discuss some major updates for Elementary OS.

530
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,800
This is the one where we see a lot of Flatpak support land.

531
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,480
So what does this look like?

532
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,220
Because Cassidy, I think the takeaway

533
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,720
that I've seen the internet at large discusses,

534
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,360
they're calling it sideloading.

535
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,040
So what are we talking about here?

536
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,360
Yeah, so we've heard from users that there's

537
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,600
a lot of these cross-platform apps or just apps that

538
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,200
don't fit the other requirements for being curated in App Center

539
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,920
that they want to use on their machines.

540
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,300
So we talked a while ago in the spring about Flatpak

541
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,200
being the future for our stack, and we're

542
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,880
going to be moving our App Center apps over to Flatpak.

543
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,020
But since Flatpak is our plan, it

544
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,960
means we can support a more secure way

545
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,120
of getting third-party apps on the system

546
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,480
from outside of the app store.

547
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,280
So that's what we call sideloading.

548
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,160
I like the screenshot you have in the blog post

549
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,240
that we'll have linked in the notes,

550
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,000
because you get an idea as an end user

551
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,280
what this is going to be like from an implementation standpoint.

552
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,520
You get an idea of how big the download is.

553
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,140
It really kind of helps you understand that this is only

554
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,440
being backed solely by the developer.

555
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,320
We as a project have not vetted this.

556
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,600
And when you add this, this is the tricky part

557
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,600
that I think I was really curious how you would parse

558
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,960
this, and I think you nailed it.

559
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,600
And the last line is, when you add this app,

560
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,680
it may add its entire repository,

561
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,360
and so you will see other apps by this developer.

562
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,640
And that's the hardest thing, I think,

563
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,680
when it comes to this kind of thing for end users

564
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,360
to wrap their heads around.

565
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,000
So this dialog box, it seems like one

566
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,720
of these things that would be so obviously a clear thing you

567
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,040
should do for end users.

568
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,220
But the reaction, and I saw your tweets today,

569
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,920
the reaction has been, oh, it's so much like Mac OS

570
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
calling it sideloading.

571
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,720
They're just locking it down even more.

572
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,320
Do you push forward and just try to ignore that completely,

573
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,840
or do you feel like that's worth addressing on the show here?

574
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,620
It's funny, because with this update,

575
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,280
we're bringing a ton of new capability to the OS

576
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,680
and a ton of new software that you

577
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,200
can install with one click.

578
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,920
And it's using an open source technology

579
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,760
that the other desktops have kind of standardized on.

580
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,560
It's this very open process, and we're being very, very honest

581
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,480
and realistic about expectations.

582
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,000
And that's actually something we've heard from our existing

583
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,920
users, is they want to know what the implications of installing

584
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,120
apps, whether it's from Flatpak or from the Ubuntu

585
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,440
repositories, they want to know what

586
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,360
the difference is between these curated apps

587
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,100
and these third party sideloaded apps.

588
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,520
So we're addressing that.

589
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,680
And I think, of course, we'll always

590
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,600
get blowback from people who probably don't even

591
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,900
use the OS.

592
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,080
And that's fine.

593
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,000
That's part of building an open source product.

594
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,080
Oh, man, you just so nailed it right there.

595
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,800
It's frustrating, too, that the comparisons are always

596
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,000
there with the Apple stuff.

597
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,600
I know.

598
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,840
To me, it seems much more just like you guys are bringing

599
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,320
some modern OS paradigms that the whole world is exploring

600
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,400
here on the Linux desktop, and it's nice to see.

601
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,360
One of the things that actually inspired the idea originally

602
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,240
is that Android comes with a built-in APK installer thing

603
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,640
where you can sideload apps.

604
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,240
That's what I thought of, not Apple.

605
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,720
Yeah.

606
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,160
So it's really funny that there's

607
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,800
this weird obsession with people comparing us to Apple.

608
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,120
And it's like we draw inspiration from all over open

609
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,720
and closed platforms and build the best product that we

610
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,080
can from those ideas.

611
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,160
Well, actually, I would imagine this is probably never

612
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,120
going away because your motivation is to sell

613
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,640
a good operating system product.

614
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,880
Apple's motivation is to sell expensive hardware.

615
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,560
In both of those, you think about what makes a good

616
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,240
customer experience first.

617
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,640
If you're not trying to sell them into a bundle of services,

618
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,400
you're not trying to sell them into an ecosystem

619
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,080
so much as you're just trying to sell them a product,

620
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,240
the user is not the product.

621
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,320
The product is the product.

622
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,620
So how do we make this the best?

623
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,520
So a lot of times, there will be a process of thinking of how

624
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,960
do we make this best for the end users that

625
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,640
will be reflective of how Apple looks at things.

626
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,400
And so those comparisons will probably never go away just

627
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,400
because the nature of the product being a product

628
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,360
and not the user being the product.

629
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,720
But there's something else you touch on in this update

630
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,400
that I just wanted to get more information on

631
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,800
because it's like super light.

632
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,040
Towards the end here, you write, the end of the month,

633
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,760
we will finalize our brand new automation powered release

634
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,800
process, meaning we will easily queue up

635
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,200
the release of several apps and desktop components.

636
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,600
I don't know what you mean there.

637
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Could you tell me more about that?

638
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,840
Because that sounds like really cool high tech stuff.

639
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,000
Yeah, so this has been an awesome, awesome bit of work

640
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,320
over the last month or so with several people

641
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,920
in the community coming together to help automate this stuff.

642
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,040
Basically, we have completely rebuilt

643
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,600
how we build elementary OS.

644
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,160
We're using, we've been adopting CI

645
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,840
across all of our over 100 repositories on GitHub.

646
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,920
We're doing things like testing builds,

647
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,880
validating with Houston CI, which is our app center test

648
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,380
suite.

649
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,160
So the same standards that we hold third party developers to,

650
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,680
our apps are tested against.

651
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,240
And then we're also linting the code

652
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,360
to keep up with code quality standards.

653
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,720
And now we even automate translation template updates.

654
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,160
So a lot of these things that kind of used

655
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,840
to be a lot of manual labor for a release

656
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,320
or for just maintaining the code in general

657
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,800
have been automated.

658
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,400
And along with that comes automating the package release

659
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,120
process.

660
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,440
So when we actually want to send out an update to users,

661
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,800
like we mentioned in the monthly update posts,

662
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,680
there's a whole big, long process

663
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,400
of preparing that release.

664
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,640
And the majority of that now has been automated

665
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,000
with continuous integration and continuous delivery,

666
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,200
which is so, so cool.

667
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,760
MARK MANDEL.

668
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,400
Hopefully, that just frees you up

669
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,520
to spend more time on the things that actually matter.

670
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:11,560
DAN SANDLER.

671
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,040
Exactly.

672
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,240
Yeah.

673
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,000
We were spending a lot of time on these release processes.

674
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,440
And now we can do more releases faster.

675
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,320
Oh, that's great.

676
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,760
Oh, that's so cool to hear.

677
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,680
So there's one thing that really strikes me.

678
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,560
So Dan, I want to give you a chance to jump in here.

679
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,000
Kind of wondering why this isn't all

680
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,360
being held for just the next elementary OS release.

681
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,560
Because the blog post, we've touched

682
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,320
on three of a dozen things that are landing that

683
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,680
looks like it's just an update coming to the existing OS.

684
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,120
Is this a strategy change?

685
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,720
You know, it really isn't a strategy change for us.

686
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,800
This is something we've been doing for a while.

687
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,200
And it's funny, because we hear from people

688
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,800
who are outside of our community talk about, oh, well,

689
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
I don't want to use an LTS-based distro,

690
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,560
because that means I won't get updates.

691
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,960
But we're totally opposite of that.

692
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,840
You have that stable base of the Ubuntu LTS underneath,

693
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,120
which is really great.

694
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,120
But we're also continually delivering updates

695
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,080
to all of our own applications every single month.

696
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,080
And we've been doing that for over a year now.

697
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,520
And all the apps in App Center are

698
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,480
released whenever those developers publish

699
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
new releases.

700
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,560
And now you can even get the latest versions

701
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,960
of third-party apps because of the great Flatback support.

702
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,480
So I think we're just continually pushing

703
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,440
that we want to be the most stable, but also most updated

704
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,760
distro that you can have.

705
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,840
And you get kind of that best of both worlds.

706
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,240
You guys better be careful, or else people

707
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,120
are going to start figuring out what you're doing.

708
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,360
And then this thing's going to blow up out of control.

709
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,240
You're not going to do it with a success.

710
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,480
You better be careful.

711
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,960
Because yeah, this is great.

712
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,680
This update, it's definitely worth a read,

713
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,920
because there's a lot more coming, including just nice

714
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:58,360
tweaks to the look and feel, the drop-down date menu,

715
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,720
just nice things for the date and time indicator,

716
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,200
just all kinds of small quality of life improvements,

717
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,480
as well as tons of new third-party software

718
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,240
that you can now get in the best-designed App

719
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,400
Center out there.

720
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,680
So hashtag, check it out.

721
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,040
Is that what the kids say, Wes?

722
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,680
Did I get that right?

723
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,240
Yes, you did.

724
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,160
Thank you.

725
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,160
I defer to Wes on those things.

726
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,800
Anyways, thank you, gentlemen, for joining us

727
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,960
and keep up the great work, because my family

728
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,160
appreciates it.

729
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,000
I love it.

730
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,600
Thank you.

731
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,360
I do, I really think it's just so great.

732
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,440
All right, Wes, we've got to do some housekeeping,

733
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,400
because everything changes.

734
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,080
We've got to stop salivating over to elementary.

735
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,360
Everything changes now.

736
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:40,880
Everything.

737
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,560
Everything, and nothing is changing.

738
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,040
Well, we're changing everything,

739
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,680
but then the stuff in the middle doesn't really change.

740
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,000
No, and stuff at the end doesn't really change,

741
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
except for it'll be sooner.

742
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Right, faster.

743
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,760
Faster.

744
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,960
So we are experimenting with a new live time slot

745
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,320
for this here humble podcast.

746
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,080
We're going to attempt to move it up a couple of hours

747
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,240
in the daytime.

748
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,000
We currently do Linux Unplugged live every Tuesday

749
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,160
at 2 PM Pacific time.

750
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,760
Now, we're going to try moving that up to noon Pacific time.

751
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,240
Still on Tuesdays, still at jblive.tv.

752
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,880
We really need the sun right above us

753
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,080
when we're podcasting.

754
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,840
It just helps a lot.

755
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,880
Yeah, it's the solar panels we installed on top of our heads,

756
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,160
Wes.

757
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,520
So we really would love you to show up,

758
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,680
because we're petrified this is going to go horrible.

759
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,880
We're just really terrified.

760
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,360
And we love doing the show live.

761
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,960
I mean, it's kind of the whole thing.

762
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,840
Well, and we've got that virtual log, and we'll miss you

763
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
if you don't come join us.

764
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,680
We've been at this live time since the show's inception,

765
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,760
and people built a routine around it.

766
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,480
So we're completely paranoid.

767
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,840
But it is something that would work better for everyone

768
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,320
involved in the production of the show.

769
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,320
So we're going to try doing noon Pacific going forward.

770
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:04,000
Now, next week, I'm traveling, so we'll pre-record an episode.

771
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So next week, we're just throwing everything.

772
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,520
Don't bother showing up live, but do check your feeds.

773
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,880
Yeah, we have a new episode.

774
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,960
Just won't do it live.

775
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,040
Then we're coming back at the new time, noon Pacific.

776
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,600
What's that East Coast time there, Wes?

777
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,880
Well, you just got to add three hours.

778
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,320
I know.

779
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,520
That's why I thought you would just save the time.

780
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,280
Yeah.

781
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,720
You're supposed to flex your math muscle over there

782
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,800
when I do those kinds of things.

783
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,920
I don't want it to be too easy for you.

784
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,800
I got to keep you sharp.

785
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,120
Thanks, yeah.

786
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,280
So this is the last two.

787
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,320
I know.

788
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,360
It's weird.

789
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:33,920
It's weird.

790
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,760
Savor it.

791
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,000
So let us know what you think.

792
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,960
And if you haven't had a chance to make it before,

793
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,960
and maybe the new time works a little better for you

794
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,040
for some reason, please, please come.

795
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,640
Because like I said, we're terrified

796
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,520
that nobody's going to show up.

797
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,520
Vote with your presence.

798
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,880
We've had our lug time at a certain specific time

799
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,480
in it forever, and it's just scary.

800
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,520
So let us know.

801
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,880
Now, also, we mentioned Brunch with Brent over at Jupiter

802
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,800
Extras, but while you're there, check out ThreatHunting101.

803
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,320
There's a lot of lingo these days

804
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,960
when it comes to protecting your network

805
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,160
and the whole quote, unquote, cyber security,

806
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,880
end quote, industry.

807
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,040
Well, just sort of with a big sharp needle

808
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,920
to pop the hype bubble, Elle has a chat.

809
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,160
You join her with a guest, special guest.

810
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,600
And I thought it was really good, ThreatHunting101.

811
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,280
Actually, you've got two special guests.

812
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,040
That makes it an extra special extra.

813
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,480
There might be some more stuff in the works.

814
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,120
In fact, there might be some other things

815
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,880
in that feed related to the topic that

816
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,920
are worth checking out too.

817
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,960
Indeed.

818
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,480
It's possible, Wes.

819
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,520
It's possible.

820
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,920
That extras, it's becoming something of a gold mine.

821
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,640
And I guess while we're here, in celebration of Mr. Daniel

822
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,840
Foray, submit your hashtag ask error questions.

823
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,040
It's a great part of the show.

824
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,080
Yeah, you want to listen to Dan say something hilarious.

825
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,960
Oh my god.

826
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,480
You got to start that chain.

827
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,520
I really appreciate, Dan, how you

828
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,040
are willing to take a ribbing from those guys

829
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
and stay true to yourself.

830
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,760
See, I was going to say bring reason.

831
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,600
Oh, well, that too, actually.

832
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,160
These guys are so nice.

833
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,200
They are, aren't they?

834
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,640
So get your questions into the crew, hashtag ask error.

835
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,640
Anything about Linux, the universe, life itself,

836
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,000
ask them and they'll answer it in a future episode.

837
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,400
All right, there you go, Wes.

838
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,920
It's so clean in here.

839
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,560
Housekeeping is a great moment in time.

840
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,560
It really is a chance to clean everything out.

841
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,480
So we have been really enjoying ourselves.

842
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,280
Everything Fedora 31, it's a great time of year.

843
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,680
You've got right before the holidays,

844
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,320
you get to celebrate the Linux days.

845
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,040
You get Ubuntu 19.10, which is really

846
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,360
like your first visceral look at the new gnome

847
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,280
shell and all the improvements of the different flavors.

848
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,000
And then Fedora usually ships somewhat on time.

849
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,920
And this time they nailed it.

850
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,360
And it's really a great opportunity for those of us

851
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,400
who just love Linux and love the different desktop

852
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,360
implementations to try it all out.

853
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,840
We've been running Fedora 31 for over a week.

854
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,400
And we have some questions about some of their bigger changes

855
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,880
and maybe just what the future holds for 32 and 33.

856
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,120
And we knew just who to ask.

857
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,080
Christian here is the senior engineer manager

858
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,360
for desktop graphics at Red Hat.

859
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,720
First of all, I love that there's a senior engineer

860
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,200
for that.

861
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,480
I might not have expected that.

862
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,080
So welcome back to the show, Christian.

863
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,640
Thank you.

864
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,840
Thanks all for having me.

865
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,400
I love your blog posts that you do kind of midway

866
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,600
into the development cycle of the next Fedora workstation.

867
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,880
They are so packed full of information

868
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,400
that these really could be the release announcement notes.

869
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,280
So on September 23, you posted what's

870
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,080
coming in Fedora workstation 31.

871
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,600
And there's actually quite a bit that didn't really

872
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,000
make it into the official bullet points of what's new.

873
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,360
One thing you guys wrote in here that I thought

874
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,640
would be really kind of interesting to get some insights

875
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,000
is you wrote, an item we feel is important

876
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,920
is reducing the need for X-Wayland

877
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,400
and having Firefox run natively on Wayland.

878
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,040
Why did you feel like that was important?

879
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,160
And why do we need to reduce our use of X-Wayland, do you think?

880
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,680
I think there's many reasons for that.

881
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,520
But I mean, I think for me, the major thing

882
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,640
is, of course, that even though we're working very hard

883
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,200
to make sure X-Wayland is a really great solution

884
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,840
and works really, really well, it still adds overhead.

885
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,560
And it's sort of like an abstraction layer

886
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,920
where you're sort of abstracting in the old X system.

887
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,360
And of course, you also maybe lose some of the advantages

888
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,560
that Wayland is meant to give you

889
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,000
by having to rely on X in terms of security and so on.

890
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,120
So yeah, we invested in making sure

891
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,760
that Firefox would get a native Wayland port.

892
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,560
And I think it's actually worth mentioning that I think

893
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,760
for the last five years at least,

894
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,800
Red Hat has more or less single-handedly maintained

895
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,840
Firefox for Linux.

896
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,320
So anyways, we did the work to make sure

897
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,080
that we could get a native port.

898
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,520
Also because a browser, right, is the most critical

899
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,400
application we have today.

900
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,120
I mean, I think often, at least for me

901
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,560
myself and I think for many others,

902
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,040
there are days where I literally don't open

903
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,160
any other application than the browser.

904
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

905
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,240
So we wanted to make sure that the browser works really well

906
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,440
and is a top-notch experience under Wayland

907
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,400
and that it runs natively and not only this old layer.

908
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,680
And of course, not starting X-Wayland eventually, right,

909
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,040
will also be a resource-saving thing.

910
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,320
That if you don't need to start it,

911
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,200
then we free up that overhead that that causes.

912
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,080
You're also, in this post, talking

913
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,040
about X-Wayland on demand.

914
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,480
Does that play into that as well?

915
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,280
Yes, exactly.

916
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,920
So at the moment, right, because after 30 years,

917
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,000
everything had a lot of hard dependencies in X

918
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,600
and are assuming things are based on X.

919
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,120
Yeah.

920
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,920
So even though Fedora has been running Wayland

921
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,520
as our primary display server for years now,

922
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,320
it was only very recently that we

923
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,280
were able to get rid of the last remnants of code in Gnome

924
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,480
that still assumed there would be an X session available.

925
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,560
So that meant that X-Wayland has always been running.

926
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,080
And if there was a problem with X-Wayland, of course,

927
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,600
it affected your whole desktop session.

928
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,600
But now that we are at the point where

929
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,960
Gnome can run on just Wayland and don't need X at all,

930
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,080
we will also then do this X-Wayland on demand

931
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,360
so that we only start it once an application actually requested.

932
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,480
So if you don't have a legacy application that still uses X,

933
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,960
that's when we start X-Wayland, as opposed to ramping it up

934
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,560
for every desktop session you have,

935
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,240
even if you don't actually run anything on Wayland,

936
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,440
start on X directly.

937
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,720
No need to have it hanging around running

938
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,560
if you're not using it.

939
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,040
Yeah.

940
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,440
My battery thanks you for that.

941
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:20,920
Yeah.

942
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,680
No, because there's a lot of discussions

943
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,840
about performance in general.

944
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,200
And of course, there's a lot of work on making animations

945
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,560
smoother and these kind of things.

946
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,120
But I think often people tend into the performance term

947
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,280
to also put resource usage.

948
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,000
And of course, so that's another thing

949
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,800
we've been looking at is like, how can we

950
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,920
get rid of processes to keep your session as small as

951
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,000
possible, especially if you don't need them?

952
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,760
Yeah.

953
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,160
I want to get to Pipewire because this is something

954
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,600
that it feels like things are getting lined up in 31,

955
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,760
but things really start to shift in 32 and 33.

956
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,440
And maybe it's good to just recap a little bit of Pipewire

957
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,000
history here.

958
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,880
So Pipewire initially was a project

959
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,280
that started to really provide remote video solutions

960
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,720
for Wayland sessions.

961
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,800
Yes, correct.

962
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,960
I mean, the original name actually,

963
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,440
if you go back and get history, you

964
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,240
can probably still see that it was originally

965
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,080
called Pulse Video.

966
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,640
So the idea was like, hey, we need something

967
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,160
like Pulse Audio for video because both for Wayland

968
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,960
but also for as we went to Flatpaks,

969
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,120
we realized that when you sandbox applications,

970
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,480
we want it as a secure way for you

971
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,840
to be still able to access things like your webcam

972
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,960
and so on.

973
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,440
So it's all like, hey, let's put together

974
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,320
what we called Pulse Video at the time.

975
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,160
And then I guess as we kept discussing and looking at it,

976
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,560
we thought, well, we can make the whole architecture

977
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,280
or desktop a lot easier to maintain and deal with

978
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,640
if we could start centralizing things

979
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,040
by instead of having Pulse Audio and Pulse Video next

980
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,520
to each other, basically have one thing that handled both.

981
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,680
And then we also said, well, maybe we can bring in Jack

982
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,400
to this too, right?

983
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,000
So because that's always been the ugly stepchild

984
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,160
of the Linux universe, it's like this extra thing

985
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,480
that you have to tweak and twiddle to get going.

986
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,880
And we thought, let's look at it if we can get the performance

987
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,040
into Pipewire that enables it to also replace Jack

988
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,880
and basically provide a drop-in replacement

989
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,480
for both Pulse Audio and for Jack

990
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,800
and, of course, provide this new video functionality we needed.

991
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,640
Now, as things have evolved, it's

992
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,000
not so much replacing Jack but more working alongside Jack?

993
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
No, it's still the goal is to replace it.

994
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,960
I mean, we will be having a separate drop-in replacement

995
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,760
process.

996
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,400
Technically speaking, no Jack application

997
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,160
will need to be rewritten.

998
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,440
It will still find the quotation mark Jack server there,

999
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,040
but it will actually be Pipewire providing that Jack server, not

1000
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,840
the native Jack process.

1001
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,680
So is it sort of like a Pipewire Jack library

1002
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,480
that the applications will just be able to communicate with?

1003
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,840
Yeah, well, I mean, this is a Don't Sobbing Manager.

1004
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,400
I don't know the details that well, but.

1005
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,520
Yeah, I'm obviously a little outside of my pay grade, too.

1006
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,320
But Jack is, well, just like Pulse Audio, it's a server,

1007
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:01,840
right?

1008
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,720
So as long as you have the server there and you speak

1009
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,480
the Jack protocol, basically, then you can communicate with.

1010
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,640
So it's essentially creating a Jack-compatible server

1011
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,480
for Pipewire.

1012
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,200
Yes, exactly.

1013
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,640
And, of course, the same on the Pulse Audio side,

1014
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,000
that it will be a Pulse Audio-compatible server

1015
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,160
for Pulse Audio applications.

1016
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,840
So my question that I just desperately need to know

1017
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,120
is, will there still be some ALSA in the stack?

1018
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,600
Like at the low level, are we still going through ALSA

1019
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,520
to get to the hardware?

1020
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,000
Yes.

1021
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,880
Yes, we are.

1022
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,360
I love it.

1023
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,080
OK.

1024
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,600
All right.

1025
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,360
Very good.

1026
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,240
Yeah, I mean, ALSA, of course, is still

1027
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,320
going to be the driver side.

1028
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,920
I mean, I guess there is definitely

1029
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,800
parts of ALSA that, of course, is not so needed anymore.

1030
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,240
I mean, back in the day, right, we

1031
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,680
had all this software mixing done in ALSA.

1032
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,640
And these days, I think Pulse Audio used to do that.

1033
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,880
And, of course, Piper do that.

1034
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,040
Of course, in some sense, we're maybe stripping back ALSA

1035
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,760
a bit to be a pure driver layer, right,

1036
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,120
as opposed to having all these sort of more high-end features

1037
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,800
over there.

1038
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,120
Yeah, that's a fair explanation.

1039
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,640
That makes sense.

1040
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,480
And that's kind of what it's doing best right now anyway.

1041
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,280
Yeah.

1042
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,000
Let's talk about 33, though.

1043
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,880
So some of this lands in 32.

1044
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,600
But in 33, the idea is to ship PipeWire

1045
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,200
as the default audio handler, with a way

1046
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,680
to hit a switchback function somehow.

1047
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,320
Is that, do you think, too aggressive?

1048
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,520
Or is that just on the edge?

1049
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,440
It's going to be like the rollout of Pulse Audio all over

1050
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:22,880
again.

1051
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,680
Yeah, I'm curious.

1052
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,080
Because as production people, we're

1053
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,840
really curious to see where this goes and very excited.

1054
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,520
Yeah, so the way we, I mean, this

1055
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,160
was me and Wim sort of sitting down and hashing out

1056
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,320
the plan for how to do this.

1057
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,120
And I mean, originally, I think, probably

1058
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,200
when I talked to you guys the last time,

1059
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,640
our plan was let's roll out jack support first

1060
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,320
and then do Pulse Audio later.

1061
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,000
I think we actually concluded in the end

1062
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,120
that that created more problem than it solved,

1063
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,000
because you suddenly then have to deal with interacting

1064
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,440
across the Pulse Audio and PipeWire boundary.

1065
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,680
So we decided, OK, we just need to roll out in one go.

1066
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,480
And so the plan now is for 32, we

1067
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,960
will have a feature complete, or at least closely feature

1068
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,560
complete, PipeWire there that you very easily can turn on.

1069
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,520
And then, of course, our hope is that you and other people

1070
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,520
start hammering on that and testing it and giving us

1071
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,640
feedback, like, hey, everything is perfect,

1072
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,600
or, hey, here are the problems.

1073
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,920
And then our goal is that for Fedora 33,

1074
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,880
we can say, hey, everyone has no report

1075
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,360
that things are really good, and we've

1076
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,760
been able to fix a lot of bugs during the lifecycle of Fedora

1077
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,080
32.

1078
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,400
So we feel confident about switching on default.

1079
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,040
But we will do the same here that we

1080
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,680
did for the Wayland rollout in Fedora,

1081
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,000
where we had a plan of rolling it out at least two releases

1082
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,520
before we actually did.

1083
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,400
But we kept finding issues that we felt

1084
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,960
were major enough to delay the release.

1085
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,760
And of course, if you experience the same here,

1086
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,680
because what I don't want is, as you said,

1087
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,840
the PulseAudio situation, where it literally took people years

1088
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,000
to stop hating PulseAudio because the rollout was so

1089
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,600
bumpy.

1090
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,240
And I don't want to repeat that experience for Pipewire.

1091
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,880
Lesson learned.

1092
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,800
Yeah, well, very good.

1093
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,000
We will bang on it for sure.

1094
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,320
And we will try to report anything that we find amiss.

1095
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,280
I mean, Wes has already been attempting to give it a go on 31.

1096
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,000
So we're very excited.

1097
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,440
Because listening to the talks and just looking

1098
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,320
at the way it's laid out, this could

1099
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,400
be an improvement in latency, like a reduction even further

1100
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,280
than what we have now.

1101
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,120
I mean, we already have Pulse applications.

1102
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,320
So if they can just talk to our Jack applications

1103
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,660
through Pipewire and not have to use all the gross bridging

1104
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,600
we have in place now.

1105
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,080
We could see an improvement in real time processing,

1106
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,280
which could be great for us for effects for our live stream.

1107
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,760
So it's pretty exciting.

1108
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,280
We've got cool technologies like Toolbox and Silverblue.

1109
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,820
You've got Wayland and Pipewire and Flatpaks.

1110
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,040
It feels like the underlying technology stuff

1111
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,600
is getting really, really solid.

1112
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,200
And don't forget tools like Podman.

1113
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,200
Right.

1114
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,360
So I wonder if, when you look at this as a developer

1115
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,120
workstation, being that you're on the desktop team,

1116
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,920
do you see that Gnome Shell is like the next big frontier

1117
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,160
of work that needs to be done?

1118
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,720
Is that what you're seeing after this?

1119
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,480
Or what's your opinion on that?

1120
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,360
Yes, we're definitely looking at if there

1121
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,320
is ways to improve Gnome Shell.

1122
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,600
And we actually have a, I don't think

1123
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,440
I've talked about it in the public blog yet,

1124
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,840
but I've been actually doing this effort with a lot

1125
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,520
of students that we are getting in every year,

1126
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,240
both in Brno in the Czech Republic

1127
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,120
and here in Boston at the Boston University,

1128
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,360
where we're trying to basically do a lot of surveys

1129
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:28,600
and do automatic data gathering to basically try to figure out

1130
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,920
what are their likes and dislikes.

1131
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,220
And especially from any of them, they

1132
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,840
come either from Windows or Mac.

1133
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,100
So they're set up with Gnome Shell desktops,

1134
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,840
and then you're capturing their experiences?

1135
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,800
Yes, exactly.

1136
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,400
Wow, that's fascinating.

1137
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,320
We're trying to build up our capability

1138
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,080
and figure out exactly how to do it better,

1139
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,920
so that we can start capturing that feedback

1140
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,600
and then improve our user experience.

1141
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,760
And that, of course, we hope to then feed back into,

1142
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,800
for instance, Gnome Shell and say that, OK, here's

1143
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
how we can make Gnome Shell an even better option

1144
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,640
for developers.

1145
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,360
But I mean, of course, in the short run, for me,

1146
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,080
the developer killer feature that we're pushing hard

1147
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,520
is, of course, the Fedora Toolbox, which, of course,

1148
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,480
is this new tool we have created and we

1149
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,360
are putting a lot of resources into to make pet containers

1150
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,520
feel natural and easy to use.

1151
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,560
And I mean, it's not an advanced product in many ways.

1152
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,000
I mean, Wes, I think you mentioned Podman.

1153
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,400
I mean, Podman, of course, is a tool for creating and running

1154
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,560
a lot of your containers.

1155
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,080
So Toolbox is basically using Podman

1156
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,720
to make that process even simpler,

1157
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,800
so that we don't need to sit there

1158
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,100
reading documentation to figure out what are commands

1159
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,600
and all the cool things and stuff.

1160
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,640
And our plan is that you can do Toolbox create,

1161
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,040
and it creates you a pet container.

1162
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,080
And then you can much more easily

1163
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,040
find and interact with your pet containers.

1164
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,320
And at the same time, we're doing UI integration.

1165
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,880
Like the idea is that, for instance,

1166
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,960
when you have a terminal opening into your toolbox

1167
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,840
or into your pet container, the prompt

1168
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,440
will be slightly different from, let's say, your host,

1169
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,600
so that you don't sort of just jump to, let's say,

1170
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,720
your 10 different terminals.

1171
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,360
You're not sure where you are anymore.

1172
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,000
Also, there's some integration with Gnome Shell Terminal

1173
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,400
to remember what Toolbox you're in as well, right?

1174
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,640
Yes.

1175
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,360
So the plan is, of course, that you very easily

1176
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,520
can find the terminal corresponding

1177
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,840
to a certain toolbox.

1178
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,160
Yeah, that's great.

1179
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,760
So that's kind of features, you know?

1180
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,400
Those high-level user experience features.

1181
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,480
All the technology's there, like you're talking about,

1182
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,280
but no one's going to find it if it's not

1183
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,160
right there in their face.

1184
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,320
Right, what's kind of thrilling about it,

1185
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,580
it's taking stuff that's super low level

1186
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,240
and bringing it all the way up to the user experience

1187
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,680
from the top of the layer all the way down to the bottom.

1188
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,440
But not even just using it like the tool,

1189
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,200
the command line, whatever, the main pages,

1190
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,440
it's the whole workflow.

1191
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,360
That seems a big deal.

1192
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,880
Yeah, so I agree.

1193
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,080
That seems like I'm already using it.

1194
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,480
As soon as I started reading what it was,

1195
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,040
I just started using it, and I love it.

1196
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,440
But I mean, I'm thinking about Gnome Shell itself,

1197
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,040
like architecturally, the transition to Gnome Shell 4,

1198
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,840
is that a near-term project, or do you

1199
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,520
think those are longer-term projects?

1200
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,920
Well, I would call it medium-term.

1201
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,680
I mean, at the moment, we had a meeting just the other day,

1202
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,560
and I said, my focus now is that I want to, in some sense,

1203
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,360
be able to sign off saying that, hey, Wayland is done.

1204
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,400
And I want us to focus on getting toolbox up and going.

1205
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,640
And of course, there's also various other polished items

1206
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,840
related to Silverblue that I want us to cross off.

1207
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,720
And I said, only once we have these in place,

1208
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,840
then I feel the time is to maybe start

1209
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,280
moving into at least more serious Gnome Shell tweaks.

1210
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,840
I mean, I'm sure that you will see smaller things coming

1211
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,280
in going forward with, like, Alan Day, who's

1212
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,080
sort of leading that effort to try to research what could

1213
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,720
sort of be Gnome Shell 4.

1214
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,400
It's still a sort of exploratory phase

1215
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,480
and trying to get use cases and discuss with, what we'll call

1216
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,640
it, student focus groups, but also with some existing RHEL

1217
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,040
customers and so on to just make sure

1218
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,040
that we don't want to sit in our own little echo chamber

1219
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,120
and saying, oh, here's the new perfect design,

1220
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,040
and then we ship it.

1221
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,920
And it's like, oh, but this really breaks things for me

1222
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,440
when I try to use Gnome Shell with Maya or something.

1223
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,800
Good job on you, because it makes sense

1224
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,320
to wait for the user survey data,

1225
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,520
wait for some of these tools that fundamentally change how

1226
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,160
someone can use their workstation,

1227
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,440
wait for those to develop, tackle the Wayland problem

1228
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,120
that's going to have to be completely solved

1229
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,880
for the next Gnome Shell.

1230
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,840
That really does seem like the right approach.

1231
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,360
It just means we have to be a little patient.

1232
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,000
We've got to wait.

1233
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,400
But things are getting better in the meantime.

1234
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,760
It's not like there isn't active continuous improvement.

1235
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,000
Right.

1236
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,640
I mean, even so, I mean, even in the Wayland transition,

1237
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,360
I'm surprised how good it all is, right?

1238
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,080
There may be X servers running under the hood,

1239
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:30,800
but I never know.

1240
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,520
It is flawless on my ThinkPad.

1241
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,680
It is completely flawless.

1242
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:40,560
Even playing Proton games on Steam on Wayland is flawless.

1243
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,080
It's great.

1244
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:41,560
Yeah.

1245
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,520
No, I mean, I think we're pretty happy with it.

1246
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,640
I mean, the one big, well, I mean,

1247
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,680
there are some smaller items.

1248
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,000
I mean, I guess you guys have seen Hans Guede, who's

1249
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,520
on our team, right, working on trying to improve some things

1250
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,920
regarding scaling of old STL games.

1251
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,360
But I mean, the one big item that we're, of course, waiting

1252
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,840
is to get things working perfectly

1253
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,320
with the NVIDIA binary driver.

1254
00:47:59,320 --> 00:47:59,800
Right.

1255
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,240
And that, of course, is something

1256
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,840
we can't do on our own, right?

1257
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,760
This is a collaboration with NVIDIA.

1258
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,360
And then, of course, we've been trying

1259
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,960
to help them put pieces in place.

1260
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,840
But of course, we need them to then try out and enable

1261
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,000
those features in their driver and tell us how it works.

1262
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,360
And then hopefully, at some point in the not too distant

1263
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,760
future, we can say, hey, Wayland or other X Wayland

1264
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,040
on top of the NVIDIA binary driver now works correctly

1265
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,640
and is ready to go.

1266
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,440
That'll be huge.

1267
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:25,920
Wow.

1268
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,640
I mean, the one thing that actually delayed that a bit

1269
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,040
was it turned out to be a bigger effort than we thought

1270
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,560
because a lot of these tools that, for instance,

1271
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,000
a lot of our rail workstation customers use,

1272
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,280
all, for instance, are based on OpenGL extensions,

1273
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,720
for instance, that NVIDIA are shipping with their driver that

1274
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,280
are custom to NVIDIA.

1275
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,200
And I mean, I think for a regular desktop user,

1276
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,600
you don't even probably know about them

1277
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,320
or ever heard about them.

1278
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,560
But if you are using one of these applications

1279
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,480
and you don't get access to those extensions,

1280
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,880
then, of course, your desktop doesn't work for you.

1281
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,200
So we ended up having to do more work on enabling

1282
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,720
the binary driver for X Wayland.

1283
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,200
But we believe we have the infrastructure now.

1284
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,640
But, of course, NVIDIA now need to find the time

1285
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,520
to do their testing and validation of it

1286
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,760
so that we can get the driver out that supports it perfectly.

1287
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,240
I'm amazed that we're even talking about this stage,

1288
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,320
though, because it does mean at some point

1289
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,680
there will be a point in time when NVIDIA binaries worked

1290
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,200
with Wayland and when it didn't.

1291
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,280
There'll be a marker in Linux's history.

1292
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,360
There's going to be new Linux users who never had

1293
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,240
to go through this.

1294
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:28,760
We're right.

1295
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,760
People will adopt Linux and never

1296
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,840
have had to worry about this.

1297
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,720
And I put a big asterisk next to my it works perfectly.

1298
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,560
It works perfectly in the right scenarios.

1299
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,560
And I think that's where Wayland's at right now.

1300
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,400
I had to switch a couple of apps that I used,

1301
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,080
drop a couple of extensions.

1302
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,120
And I happen to already be switching over to Firefox

1303
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,000
anyway, so it sort of worked perfectly for that.

1304
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,960
And on the right hardware, like my ThinkPad with Intel

1305
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,480
graphics or when I hook up my AMD eGPU, it's great.

1306
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,520
On my machine upstairs, it's a little more tricky.

1307
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,840
So there's some scenarios where it's not perfect yet,

1308
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,880
but it showed me that everything that's

1309
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,720
sort of been promised for so many years

1310
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,480
is really beginning to solidify.

1311
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,360
It's not 100% yet, but it really is beginning to get there.

1312
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,240
I mean, I think there's a lot of sort of unsung heroes here.

1313
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,800
I mean, there's a guy called Olivier Ferdinand on our team

1314
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,320
who I think is mostly actually known as being

1315
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,120
the founder of XFC, but he's been doing, for instance,

1316
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,240
an absolutely stellar job the last few years just keeping

1317
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,440
track of every wayland bug that has come in and making sure

1318
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,000
we fix it and then figure out what is a corner case

1319
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,400
triggering this issue.

1320
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,600
And it's sort of like, not the person we might sort of see

1321
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,840
in the headlines, but definitely some of those people

1322
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,080
who've been doing so much legwork and just making sure

1323
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,920
it becomes a solid experience for more and more people.

1324
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,880
And even things that might feel obscure,

1325
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,720
that we actually get them resolved.

1326
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,600
And I mean, that blog post I mentioned I wrote,

1327
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,200
I mean, the one feature, for instance, he worked on there,

1328
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,720
which I mentioned was that he made sure that we got

1329
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,720
some of these accessibility features brought into wayland

1330
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,640
that we used to have and even improved them

1331
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,480
at the same point.

1332
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,080
So, you know, some disabled users have trouble

1333
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:01,920
with mouse clicks.

1334
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,840
So there's this feature in, you can turn on that

1335
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,440
when you just hover your mouse over something,

1336
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,040
it will, after a certain amount of time, click automatically.

1337
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,080
And this used to be like this timer up in the shell,

1338
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,440
but what he did was he actually turned it

1339
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,400
into the cursor itself.

1340
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,160
Now you see this little almost cake diagram

1341
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,160
sort of swirl up as it takes up before it does the click.

1342
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,120
Yeah, it looks really nice.

1343
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,800
There's a screenshot in the blog post,

1344
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,280
which we will link in the show notes.

1345
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,440
Thank you for mentioning that,

1346
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,880
because I think that is the biggest story

1347
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,200
about free software in general,

1348
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,280
is there's so many unsung heroes behind the scenes

1349
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,920
and some of them work on things that we use and love

1350
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,280
every single day, or some of them are solely responsible

1351
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,200
for making this free software accessible

1352
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,960
for an entire category of users.

1353
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,560
And that's such a massive impact.

1354
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,640
And you're right, they don't make headlines.

1355
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,760
And that's something I'd love to try to change somehow.

1356
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,720
That could be a goal of mine for 2020,

1357
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,840
new year's resolution.

1358
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,800
I mean, there's all these efforts that I might not see at all

1359
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,160
or have any idea of being worked on,

1360
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,560
but turns out are crucial.

1361
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,960
Remarkable too.

1362
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,000
Well, Christian, thank you.

1363
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,040
And thank you to the entire team for all of this.

1364
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,960
We've been enjoying Fedora 31

1365
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,280
and we're looking forward to future releases too.

1366
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,280
It's been a solid maintenance release

1367
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,040
and you can see things are getting lined up

1368
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,920
for the next couple of releases.

1369
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,760
I think it's great.

1370
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,600
It's really great to see this nice steady progress happening.

1371
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,280
I know and I can't quite even describe it,

1372
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,240
but over and over, I'm enjoying using Fedora 31.

1373
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,440
It's just a solid release.

1374
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,440
Next week, we're gonna dive into what we love

1375
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,880
about our favorite distributions.

1376
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,720
Like what are the things,

1377
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,320
the core things we really love about them

1378
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,840
and then what's the one thing we would change

1379
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,760
to make them perfect.

1380
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,680
So we'll talk more about that.

1381
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,400
I, in the meantime, will give you something

1382
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,600
you can fix immediately about Fedora.

1383
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,320
I will have a couple of links in the show notes.

1384
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,280
Let's try to add them in order of priority.

1385
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,960
So I will start with better looking fonts

1386
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,240
for Fedora as the first link.

1387
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,520
If you only do one thing, do the suggestions in that link.

1388
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,520
Then there's a second link where there's a,

1389
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,160
I love the Friya code or Fira code.

1390
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,000
Fira?

1391
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:01,840
Fira?

1392
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,040
Yeah, that's probably how you say it, Wes.

1393
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:03,880
Thank you.

1394
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,120
Either way, it's a handsome font.

1395
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,040
So go get that.

1396
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,680
And then the last one, if you really wanna go into deep

1397
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,840
about the sad state of font rendering,

1398
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,840
not just on Linux, my friends, but on all platforms,

1399
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,640
there is an article that really nerds out on this.

1400
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,760
It's a fantastic read if you're at all interested

1401
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,960
in typography or fonts.

1402
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,360
And the nice thing is it wraps with a few recommendations

1403
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,440
on what you can do to fix it.

1404
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,760
So definitely worth a read if you're running,

1405
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,440
well, really actually out of the gate, out of the box,

1406
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,440
the Ubuntu distributions are generally the better off

1407
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,440
on this particular area, but if you're rolling your own,

1408
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,440
setting up Arch or Gen2 or you're on Fedora

1409
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,920
or some of the other distributions,

1410
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,840
they may not have chosen some of the font options

1411
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,080
that make a difference.

1412
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:49,840
So, and that last link, that last link actually explains

1413
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,400
why fixing your fonts matters.

1414
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,240
It's worth looking into.

1415
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,360
It's worth the effort, yeah.

1416
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:58,680
That's the Westpain recommendation.

1417
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,960
Well, Wes, before we run,

1418
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,400
let's just do a super quick mention of the pick

1419
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,320
because it's really a pick of the week

1420
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,320
that's just for you and only for you.

1421
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,320
And that is called Kexec Boot.

1422
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,040
This is a project that we have linked in the show notes

1423
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,960
that is a nice Linux bootloader implementation

1424
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,000
based on Wes's favorite, Kexec.

1425
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,040
Quick reminder, what's Kexec, Wes?

1426
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:26,360
Okay, well, Kexec is a tool and a ability feature

1427
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,800
of the Linux kernel that lets you load a new kernel

1428
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,680
without having to reboot.

1429
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,280
So you don't, the hardware doesn't have to go

1430
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,600
through the reboot process.

1431
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,240
You just jump right to the new kernel.

1432
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,440
One could in theory be sitting here right now

1433
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,920
and be running Kubuntu and Kexec into Fedora.

1434
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,760
Yeah, exactly.

1435
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,600
In theory.

1436
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,800
You know, you can use it for all kinds of things

1437
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,800
between rescue, that facility is used

1438
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,480
for crash jump sometimes.

1439
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,720
You can boot into a crash kernel

1440
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,400
and then save that state off onto a file system somewhere.

1441
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,600
So there's lots of things.

1442
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,720
I use it for trying out new systems

1443
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,840
because you don't have to go mucking about

1444
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,920
with your bootloader.

1445
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,960
You can just go jump into any old kernel and inner MFS.

1446
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,520
As long as you point it to the right partition, it'll boot.

1447
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,480
Nobody wants to muck.

1448
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,400
So Kexec Boot is a neat project.

1449
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,880
I'd actually not seen before,

1450
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,040
but I got it installed and running today.

1451
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,120
And it is just kind of what it says.

1452
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,680
It's a bootloader for Kexec.

1453
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,680
So it goes and talks to the kernel,

1454
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,440
goes and finds out about all the partitions you have.

1455
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,400
And then it tries to open them up, load them

1456
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,800
and see if it has any boot entries.

1457
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,720
And it's got a simple boot.cfg syntax.

1458
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,560
You know, you kind of just say,

1459
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,560
here's the kernel I want and a label

1460
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,520
and here's the command line to append to the kernel.

1461
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,240
And then instead of using, you know,

1462
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:34,200
booting into it like a bootloader would do, it Kexecs.

1463
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,160
That is neat.

1464
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,280
But it's targeted to look like a real bootloader too.

1465
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,760
So it opens up on a TTY

1466
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,520
and it's got like a nice little graphical menu

1467
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,880
and it'll list out the different kernels you have available.

1468
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,680
So it opens up a new TTY on your existing distro

1469
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,720
that you're running, your main distro.

1470
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,560
Yeah.

1471
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,400
And I mean, you probably want to use this at a level

1472
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,200
because it's poking around with all the partitions.

1473
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,040
Like, I don't know how nicely it'll play

1474
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,080
with something that's up and running.

1475
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:56,960
You probably want it at a level

1476
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,480
where you haven't started all of your applications necessarily.

1477
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,120
I know, Wes.

1478
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,800
Hard shut down those things, close them all out.

1479
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,840
Because it eventually just drops it all from memory

1480
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,120
and then loads the new system, right?

1481
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,880
Yeah, I mean, once you hit go,

1482
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,320
you're thinking about everything you want working on.

1483
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,520
I love it.

1484
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,360
I love it.

1485
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,360
And so it's a package that it installs

1486
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:20,200
and then it just takes over TTY.

1487
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,960
Yeah, and then it's got a nice little GUI

1488
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,640
and you kind of select which kernel you want,

1489
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,560
hit enter and there you go.

1490
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,520
I'm going to break my system with this one, I think.

1491
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,360
I love it.

1492
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,200
I love it.

1493
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,040
See, the nice part is you won't

1494
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,520
because you didn't modify your bootloader.

1495
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,560
So all you have to do is reboot

1496
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,280
and you'll get back to where you started from.

1497
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,840
Oh, challenge accepted there, sir.

1498
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,320
Challenge accepted.

1499
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,520
All right.

1500
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,720
Well, go check out Mr. Martin Wimpress

1501
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,960
over at the Ubuntu Podcast

1502
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,800
because not only did he have that laptop review,

1503
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,080
but there's just something every single week,

1504
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,520
it turns out, that you could catch

1505
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,760
over at ubuntupodcast.org.

1506
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,840
Thanks for being here, Wimpy.

1507
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,960
My pleasure.

1508
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,560
And of course you can get more Dan.

1509
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:59,240
Mr. Foray is one of three fantastic hosts

1510
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,920
of the User Air Podcast.

1511
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,040
So go check out User Air.

1512
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,160
Thanks for being here, Dan.

1513
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,000
Thank you.

1514
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,960
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1515
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,840
Thank you.

1516
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,320
Also, a big thank you to Cassidy for coming here

1517
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,720
and help us explaining what they're doing.

1518
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,680
I think it's great.

1519
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,520
I love it, Cassidy.

1520
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,680
So glad you could make it too.

1521
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,520
Thank you.

1522
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,340
And thanks for having me.

1523
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,180
Thank you, sir.

1524
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,800
Stay a while and listen.

1525
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,080
And Mr. Wes Payne, thank you for making it.

1526
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:20,920
Indeed.

1527
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,120
I should say, yeah, yeah.

1528
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,200
Since episode 100, I don't think you've missed,

1529
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,120
I mean, maybe you were traveling once or twice.

1530
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,080
I've been traveling once or twice, but other than that.

1531
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,720
So, I mean, you've probably been here

1532
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,240
for like maybe minus two.

1533
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,280
So thank you.

1534
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,000
Not too shabby.

1535
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Check you out over at TechSnap.Systems

1536
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,640
with Mr. Jim Salter talking benchmarks.

1537
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,240
Oh, yeah.

1538
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,360
You want to find about how slow or fast you just may be

1539
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,960
and how you might measure it, check out TechSnap 415.

1540
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,040
You need to know.

1541
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,400
You just need to know where you're at.

1542
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,180
I mean, I think with some of the tips in that episode,

1543
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,060
you might be doing some benchmarks before long.

1544
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,040
Oh, yeah.

1545
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:56,640
Oh, yeah.

1546
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,360
Oh, yeah.

1547
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,280
Oh, yeah, definitely.

1548
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,400
I love that kind of stuff.

1549
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,080
Go check out the network at Jupiter Signal.

1550
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,760
LinuxUnplugged.com is our website.

1551
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:10,080
LinuxUnplugged.com slash 326 is the URL for all of our show

1552
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,520
notes this week.

1553
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,120
And slash subscribe for that if you want to get, you know,

1554
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,640
maybe an RSS feed or something.

1555
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,600
Thanks for being here.

1556
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,000
We won't be here next Tuesday.

1557
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,520
So there's that.

1558
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,200
But there will be a show.

1559
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,400
Yes, thank you.

1560
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,120
Yes.

1561
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:32,800
We already explained this, Wes.

1562
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:59,200
Do you have a good Halloween?

1563
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,360
Anything happen to your neck of the woods?

1564
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:06,200
My neighbor's door was open for a weirdly long time.

1565
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,320
So I just moved, and I've not met this particular neighbor.

1566
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,760
But their door, I mean, like where I'm on the left

1567
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,120
in the hallway, he's like straight through.

1568
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,400
So I sort of, I'd taken a small nap, let's say,

1569
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,440
got up at like 11 PM before doing some stuff.

1570
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,920
Went to go take the dogs out, and the door's just open.

1571
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,000
It's just hanging open.

1572
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,960
And then I woke up the next morning, and it's still open.

1573
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,800
They had a Halloween party is what they had.

1574
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,400
I think they had too much Halloween.

1575
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,880
A little candy rambunctious.

1576
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,280
I did my Halloween the weekend before Halloween.

1577
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,200
Yeah, that's nice.

1578
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,400
Can't get it over with early.

1579
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,740
Yeah, it was pretty uneventful.

1580
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,440
Can I tell you the most American thing

1581
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,080
that I've seen since I emigrated?

1582
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,040
Yes, please.

1583
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,120
There was a family on my street trick or treating

1584
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:51,840
in a golf cart.

1585
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,880
Well, you don't want to have to burn off

1586
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,240
of those candy calories.

1587
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,640
You don't want to get exercise.

1588
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,600
You've been working hard for those candy calories.

1589
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,360
Plus, think about how much more candy you can carry back,

1590
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,480
because your arms are too weak to really carry it otherwise.

1591
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,440
Yeah, you need that hauling capacity.

1592
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,760
It was amazing.

1593
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,840
And the driver was holding a big gulp

1594
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,280
just to complete the picture.

1595
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,000
Stop it.

1596
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,360
Are you serious?

1597
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,120
No.

1598
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,680
Well, if you get it concentrated enough,

1599
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,560
you can just dissolve the candy right in it.

1600
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:23,920
I bet you it's booze.

1601
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,160
I bet you it's booze in a big gulp.

1602
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:31,640
We did get Jell-O shots.

1603
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,280
That was cool.

1604
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,280
We got handed Jell-O shots.

1605
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:33,920
Oh, that's nice.

1606
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,320
Yeah, that was pretty great.

1607
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,920
That's really adult candy anyway.

1608
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,000
Yeah, for sure.

1609
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,800
Wyatt wrote, hope you guys had a happy Halloween.

1610
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:45,000
I know I did while I was trying to get my local Sampasher

1611
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,480
to automatically mount on my machine this morning.

1612
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,120
A Linux kernel CVE stuck out like a sore thumb

1613
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,840
while I was viewing dMessage.

1614
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,800
Dun, dun, dun.

1615
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,520
All right, so go vote JBtitles.com.

1616
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,920
Go pick our title while I read the rest of this.

1617
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,720
You can get the full information and links

1618
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:05,320
the whole CVE will have in the show notes.

1619
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,680
To summarize, this bug affects AMD, Centaur,

1620
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,280
and other non-Intel processors except for the Intel Xeon PHI

1621
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,760
family and a range of Intel Atom processors.

1622
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:18,040
You have to disable simultaneous multi-threading SMT

1623
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,120
to mitigate this bug.

1624
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,560
Enabling the mitigation will cripple any hypervisors

1625
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,640
you are running under the effect of processors.

1626
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,480
My guess, the CVE comes out of the Spectre kerfuffle

1627
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,200
that happened in January.

1628
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,760
Unfortunately, when I read dMessage,

1629
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,480
I didn't get my Sampasher to mount on boot,

1630
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,840
so I don't get Sampasher's.

1631
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,160
Regards, Wyatt.

1632
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,560
What a weird series.

1633
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,120
Because of this whole Intel Spectre mitigation stuff,

1634
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,720
he can't get his Samba stuff to mount.

1635
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,440
Didn't Jim just hit a weird series of bugs

1636
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,160
with WireGuard and the kernel?

1637
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:54,520
Oh, yeah, that was an AMD bug given not so random numbers.

1638
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,040
Yeah, that's what WireGuard was not so happy with.

1639
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,560
It's just sometimes the weirdest esoteric problems

1640
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,200
manifest in a way that.

1641
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,880
Well, we have so many different levels.

1642
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,200
Everything's so complicated.

1643
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,520
A violation of one of your assumptions way down below

1644
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,560
makes weird stuff happen.

1645
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,920
Right, assumptions that are happening before you even

1646
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,920
know things are happening.

1647
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:13,440
Right.

1648
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:39,800
Well, there we have it.
