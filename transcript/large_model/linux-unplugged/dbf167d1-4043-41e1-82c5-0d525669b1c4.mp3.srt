1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Congratulations!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,240
A big congratulations to the Linux Foundation.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,080
They announced a game engine today.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,220
Did you see this, Wes?

5
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:07,720
I did.

6
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,720
Very exciting.

7
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,240
Apparently donated from AWS.

8
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,800
Oh, very great.

9
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,820
There's no version for Linux, though.

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,320
Not yet.

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,560
I mean, they're working on it.

12
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,640
Of course.

13
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,160
I mean, at this point, it's kind of the corporate friendly

14
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,360
software foundation, right?

15
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:34,200
Oh, hey, friends.

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,080
Welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

17
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,880
My name is Chris.

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,920
My name is Wes.

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,880
Hello, Wes.

20
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,200
Is that a cheese steak you've got there?

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,840
Unfortunately, none for you.

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,160
No, no.

23
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,680
I thought we'd talked about this.

24
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,720
Well, this episode is brought to you

25
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,760
by the all-new Cloud Guru.

26
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,480
They are the leader in learning for the Cloud

27
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,880
Linux and other model tech skills.

28
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,360
Hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

29
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,840
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,480
Well, coming up on the show today, we all know it's true.

31
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,720
We hate to admit it, but the Linux server

32
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,840
is what makes the money.

33
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,320
It's not the desktop.

34
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,900
In fact, it's where all the corporate sponsored,

35
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,920
for the most part, nearly all corporate sponsored development

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,440
time goes.

37
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,080
But there has been a change and something we've

38
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,680
covered on the show before.

39
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,760
And Linux server admins don't really

40
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,400
know where to turn next, especially those that got

41
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,400
themselves all caught up in the Red Hat ecosystem.

42
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,200
They are stuck between some hard choices.

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,400
And if you go by apparent community size,

44
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,880
Rocky Linux has a lot of momentum at this time.

45
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,400
But this choice is a critical one,

46
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,360
and we thought we needed to consider the entire picture.

47
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,160
So last week, we ran a new segment on the show

48
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,600
that we actually cut.

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,440
And we cut it for completion's sake

50
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,560
because we decided we wanted to play it in today's episode.

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,320
And it provoked a strong discussion

52
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,360
after the show that took place after we

53
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,080
stopped the official recording.

54
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,600
And we thought we should take both the new segment

55
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,320
and the response to that new segment

56
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,680
and play it in one single episode for you.

57
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,840
This week, we're going to play that cut information,

58
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,040
that cut story, and that response.

59
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,640
And we hope that after this episode,

60
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,440
you're going to look at the Linux server landscape, which

61
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,040
is exceedingly important for something that we all love.

62
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,200
We hope you're going to look at it a little differently.

63
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,360
Even if you're not an admin yourself

64
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,640
or in the Red Hat ecosystem, I think

65
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,400
there's some questions that get posed that we should all

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,120
listen to and all consider and stuff

67
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,640
that those of us who've been using Linux for a long time

68
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,400
know at our core is probably extremely critical.

69
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,940
So we're going to get to all of that.

70
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,240
We're going to have some community news.

71
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,640
But first, we have to say time-appropriate greetings

72
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,720
to our virtual lug.

73
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,760
Hello, Mumble Room.

74
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,920
Hello, Mumble Room.

75
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,040
Whoa.

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,440
There's a lot of you in there.

77
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,200
Great to see all of you.

78
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,640
Thank you so much for making it.

79
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,760
Shout out to Poppy and Wimpy.

80
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,640
We haven't seen you for a while.

81
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,840
Welcome back, gentlemen.

82
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,000
Nice to be here again.

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,960
Absolutely.

84
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,440
And we hope that you're having an excellent day

85
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,800
and had a great weekend.

86
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,760
I set off for a little adventure this weekend.

87
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,840
And I have some good news and some bad news.

88
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,160
It's going to be another little quick story time

89
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,320
before we get into the show.

90
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,520
Stay a while and listen.

91
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,920
So I decided to spend the 4th of July out in the woods,

92
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,000
let Levi kind of get away from the fireworks

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,840
because the little pup doesn't really like all the explosion.

94
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,080
And well, I'll tell you the bad news first.

95
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,880
The wife lady and I were heading off, going to go get set up.

96
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,600
And we kind of just, even though we know better,

97
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,960
even though we're not noobs anymore,

98
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,760
we made some critical mistakes.

99
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,040
And as we were leaving from our home base,

100
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,400
we kind of were in a rush and didn't pay attention

101
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,360
to a couple of things.

102
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,960
And like a good boy, I thought I had everything figured out.

103
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,400
I knew I was in a rush, and I knew I was in a time crunch.

104
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,880
So I went around, and I tried to make sure everything

105
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,520
was all put away.

106
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,320
I collected all my tech gadgets and put them

107
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,920
in a little basket and made sure everything that was stowed

108
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,640
need to be stowed.

109
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,640
And I thought, OK, I was doing everything.

110
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,440
And my wife, Adia, she's in a car behind me.

111
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,040
I'm going down the road in Lady Joops in the RV.

112
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,720
And I'm thinking, this is going to be a great trip

113
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,160
because we're going to test some stuff for the road trip

114
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,040
to Salt Lake City in Denver, get an idea how the power

115
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,480
system is still holding up after a year or so,

116
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,080
really put everything through its paces.

117
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,040
And I'm about 25 minutes or so into the drive,

118
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,600
and I'm pulling off the highway into a gas station.

119
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,680
And I hear a rush of water behind me.

120
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,040
And I turn around, and I find an indoor tidal wave

121
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,840
rushing down the center of Lady Joops,

122
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,720
like a wave of water coming at me.

123
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,960
Thankfully, I was already pulling off the highway

124
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,600
because I had to jump into action.

125
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,000
So I pull off.

126
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,160
I park the RV immediately.

127
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,840
There's nearly standing water in the RV at this point,

128
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,880
total worst case danger zone for RVs.

129
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,840
So I was rushing into the back.

130
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,600
I can almost instinctively figure out what's happened.

131
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,720
I think I already know.

132
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,520
And as I'm getting back there, I hear the bzzz, bzzz, bzzz,

133
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,360
which is our water pump as it's pumping away and pumping away.

134
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
I open the back door.

135
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,560
It's kind of like this one move.

136
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,000
I open my back door, and I flip off

137
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,960
the water pump, which should have been off,

138
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,720
a critical mistake.

139
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,160
My eyes knew exactly where to go.

140
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,680
I look right at the sink that I'd put my tech basket in that

141
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,800
had all my gadgets.

142
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,760
Every charger I have, every brick, a game controller

143
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,400
we have, a tablet, everything.

144
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,440
Just put it all in this basket, and everything

145
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,280
was floating in a bath of water because the water had been

146
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,560
pouring right into this basket.

147
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,680
And I look up, and my old 2013 MacBook Pro

148
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,360
had slid across the counter.

149
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,960
It runs Arch, by the way, and hit the water handle

150
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,520
and turned the water on.

151
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,400
And it's a heavy old laptop, a big, old MacBook

152
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
from the older days when they were thick and heavy.

153
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,360
And it slid off and hit the handle in just a way

154
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,120
that it managed to turn it on.

155
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,720
And it must have been going for almost 15 minutes

156
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,400
because we managed to pump somewhere between 15 and 20

157
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,760
gallons of water into the RV.

158
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,200
I mean, first it filled the basket.

159
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,480
Then it filled the sink.

160
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,040
And then it just started overflowing and overflowing.

161
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,800
And we spent about an hour trying to get all that dried up.

162
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,680
And man, all of the gadgets are pretty much wrecked.

163
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,760
In like one fell swoop, I basically

164
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,160
took out nearly every gadget I own, not my phone,

165
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,320
not my ThinkPad.

166
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,200
But everything else essentially got

167
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,680
wiped out in this one moment.

168
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,960
It's like your own water-based EMP device, betrayed

169
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,560
by your own MacBook, no less.

170
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,600
This is horrible.

171
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,520
My old trusty 20th, you know, the one I walk, the one I'm like,

172
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,960
this is how they used to build them,

173
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,120
with a good keyboard and ports.

174
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,520
And it runs Linux.

175
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,360
And now that bastard, it wrecked everything.

176
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,040
And of course, it's still good to go.

177
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,960
Oh, it survived?

178
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,840
No way.

179
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,600
Yeah, it survived.

180
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,160
Yeah, it got a little bit of water on the screen.

181
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,040
But I let it dry, and it's working just fine.

182
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,320
I can't believe it.

183
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,840
Five days later, everything in the RV seems OK.

184
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,040
We got it pretty dry.

185
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,800
Thankfully, we were already pulling over.

186
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
And my wife was in the RV with me

187
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,840
within minutes, getting everything wiped down

188
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,760
and all of that.

189
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,680
So wow.

190
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,640
But just to have like, you know, like I had a fire tablet

191
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,360
that I had been carrying around because I use it

192
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,080
for Home Assistant.

193
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,680
And I was walking around, turning off things,

194
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,640
and setting automations.

195
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,920
And I set it in the basket.

196
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,160
So this guy just didn't want it to be loose.

197
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,600
Gone.

198
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,480
Wasted.

199
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,160
All of it.

200
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,360
Just wasted.

201
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
So that's how I started my 4th of July weekend.

202
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,560
But I do have some good news.

203
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,920
Good news, everyone.

204
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,840
While my slide issues are not fixed yet,

205
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,720
and I was hoping to get them fixed before the Denver trip,

206
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,600
thanks to Virtual Lug member Kernel's help right there,

207
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
he turned me on to the Vroom system.

208
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,960
And I've contacted the creator of the Vroom slide system,

209
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,400
who is an RVer, like me, who had the same slide system I do.

210
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,840
And it broke on his first trip.

211
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,240
And he's a mechanical engineer.

212
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,960
And he just said, screw it, I'm going to build a better system.

213
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,120
And now he has.

214
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,760
I don't know if very many people have ever installed these

215
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,000
before.

216
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,120
It looks pretty new.

217
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,640
So I'm kind of rolling the dice here.

218
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,200
But I'm hoping it's going to be like the final solution.

219
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,840
But the issue is, you know, with the way the timing worked out

220
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,240
with the upcoming road trip, we're

221
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,960
not going to get in there until after the road trip.

222
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,400
So that means all through Salt Lake City and Denver.

223
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,000
And until September, we're not going to have a living room.

224
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,160
But the road show will go on.

225
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,280
And we'll still have a great time.

226
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,640
We'll still make content from the road.

227
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,880
It'll just be a little more cramped.

228
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,720
You want to come and stay in there, right, Wes?

229
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,480
Of course.

230
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,480
While you're beta testing a new slide system, no problem.

231
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,560
Bring the dogs, too, Wes.

232
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,600
We'll just have a big old sleepover.

233
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,640
So yeah, there you go.

234
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,600
That's what's going on.

235
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,140
People have been asking for an update.

236
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,040
I wasn't really going to cover much.

237
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,320
But that's some progress, at least.

238
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,480
I want to get to the community news this week.

239
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,200
And let's start with IBM's president and former Red Hat

240
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,720
boss, Jim Whitehurst, stepping down.

241
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,680
Just about three years on the nose

242
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,120
since the announcement of the IBM acquisition.

243
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,840
And that president position at IBM

244
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,200
is the classical position someone takes in the company

245
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,520
before they become CEO.

246
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,280
So a lot of us expected Whitehurst was in line

247
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,040
to be CEO.

248
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,240
In fact, the board had arranged it

249
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,440
so he would become president.

250
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,280
So it kind of seemed like the board was preparing

251
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,200
for Whitehurst while there was an interim CEO.

252
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,800
And Wall Street seemed to like this idea as well,

253
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,040
because when the news was announced on a Friday,

254
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,680
IBM stock dropped 4%.

255
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,280
But now IBM's chief and interim CEO

256
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,760
is apparently becoming the permanent CEO.

257
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:25,480
Avid Krishna has managed to work at IBM since 1990, 31 years.

258
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,160
How about that?

259
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,320
Old-timer, yeah.

260
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,160
Yeah.

261
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,080
And it's kind of wild.

262
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,240
The Financial Times, which sometimes has a paywall,

263
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,640
depending on how many times you've clicked a link,

264
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,640
but they have an interview with Krishna that is, wow,

265
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,160
is this telling.

266
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,200
He was going to be the transitional exec,

267
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,240
but then it seems, with this Financial Times interview,

268
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,760
we'll have a link to that, it seems

269
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
like maybe he worked with the board

270
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,440
to work Whitehurst out and become the new CEO.

271
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,120
And there's some quotes in here that are remarkable.

272
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,240
And the article says that IBM is now doubling down

273
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,920
on IBM's current path under Krishna's leadership.

274
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,960
Quote, this is Krishna.

275
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,640
He's done amazing for us, but he wasn't

276
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,080
going to be here forever.

277
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,600
Speaking in the interview with Financial Times, he added,

278
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,480
acquired CEOs normally only last a year or two.

279
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,760
And then he went on to suggest that,

280
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,760
while he had been in the running to succeed him,

281
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,560
any hope of that had been dashed as the company's board has now

282
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,980
backed him in the next stage of IBM's overhaul.

283
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,520
And then he points in the interview

284
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,520
to the fact that the board had named him as chair

285
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,960
of executive earlier in the year as a sign of that

286
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,400
was backing him, and that the shakeup now

287
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,400
is about building a leadership team to take IBM where

288
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,040
I'm leading it, he says.

289
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,580
He's got an idea, he's got a vision,

290
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,700
and it wasn't Whitehurst.

291
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,960
It's his vision, and it's all about the cloud.

292
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,400
This Financial Times interview basically

293
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,000
makes it sound like Krishna worked Whitehurst out.

294
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,800
It does, doesn't it?

295
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,960
I mean, it's quite telling.

296
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,120
And especially when you think of Krishna

297
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,280
being one of the people internally who was pushing

298
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,040
for the Red Hat acquisition, you got to wonder,

299
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,680
maybe this was part of his personal plan for a long time,

300
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,880
and it seems to be working out for him, at least.

301
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,580
Yeah, everybody always says that Krishna

302
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,560
was the one that was pushing the CEO at the time

303
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,920
for the Red Hat acquisition.

304
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,280
But if you've ever worked in a big company,

305
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,680
you know what I'm about to say rings true.

306
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,800
Big companies are really good at grabbing

307
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,360
on to a narrative that's out there right now

308
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,480
and spinning it to make the new leadership seem competent.

309
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,740
And so the Red Hat acquisition was still fresh.

310
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,160
It was still new when he was the new interim CEO.

311
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,200
And it just seems natural to me that a 110-year-old company

312
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,520
that knows how to message would latch onto a narrative

313
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,920
like that and use it to promote the new boss,

314
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,200
regardless of how true it may or may not be.

315
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,020
So I don't put a lot of stock in the idea

316
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,800
that Krishna was the man behind the merger.

317
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,860
It's definitely possible, but I feel

318
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,800
like that's gotten a life of its own that I don't completely

319
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,740
agree with.

320
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,120
I'd like to see some proof of it,

321
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,320
because what I've seen here is a 30-year-long company

322
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,960
man who is well-liked and has done good in the cloud

323
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,760
division.

324
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,480
But he seems very much like a traditionalist in this space.

325
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,080
The Mayor, I know you want to jump in.

326
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,200
I want to give you a chance to sound off.

327
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,280
I helped Jim Whitehurst when he transitioned

328
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,080
into CEO at Red Hat.

329
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,480
And one thing, one time I was traveling with him,

330
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,640
and one thing that he told me was,

331
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,840
and I think this is kind of the same thing that's

332
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,480
going on here.

333
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,880
When he was at Delta, he sort of thought

334
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,080
that he was in line to be the next CEO as well.

335
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,360
And then once it became abundantly clear

336
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,560
that they weren't going to tap him for that,

337
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,800
he was basically out.

338
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,640
And he's a very ambitious guy, and he has his vision,

339
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,600
and he has his leadership style.

340
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,200
And I think that he just doesn't want to be in any other position

341
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
aside from the top.

342
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,800
So I think that's pretty much what happened here exactly

343
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,640
again.

344
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,240
Yeah, and it's telling that it's three years on the nose, which

345
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,040
maybe suggests there was some deal in place.

346
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,600
And when that had wrapped up, and he

347
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,520
wasn't going to get the job he wanted, he decided to leave.

348
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,080
And I think that the mayor, thank you for that insight.

349
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,600
He's, if you don't know, because it

350
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,920
was cut from last week's episode,

351
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,640
but it'll be in this week's episode,

352
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,000
the mayor is the community manager over at Alma Linux.

353
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,760
And so he has some insight into this world.

354
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,800
And when Jim was at Red Hat, after the acquisition,

355
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,840
a lot of us in the community thought, OK, well,

356
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,480
he's kind of like a firewall.

357
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,560
Between a 110-year-old company and a young,

358
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,560
modern Red Hat that has to be super flexible.

359
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,080
And I worry that with Whitehurst gone,

360
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,800
that leadership firewall that defends the culture of Red Hat

361
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,040
is also gone.

362
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,880
And I think that the traditional model of IBM

363
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,480
is not compatible with the innovative model

364
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,920
that Red Hat has to use.

365
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,600
And I grabbed a couple of clips of Whitehurst from a TED Talk,

366
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,480
just a couple of short clips, we'll link the full talk,

367
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,040
that really encapsulate what I'm talking about here.

368
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,240
And this is a clip of Jim Whitehurst explaining

369
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,840
the culture shock that he felt just a couple of weeks

370
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,200
after he left Delta and switched to Red Hat.

371
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,800
It was not like any other traditional large company

372
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,040
he'd ever been at.

373
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,000
I began to realize something significant was happening

374
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,880
my second week on the job at Red Hat.

375
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,960
I was in a meeting talking to the team about our strategy

376
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,320
for an area called virtualization.

377
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,920
For those of you who aren't in technology,

378
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,080
virtualization was the thing everybody

379
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,240
was talking about before they were talking about the cloud.

380
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,320
And through this, I had the senior team

381
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,920
and a bunch of the engineers kind of walking

382
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,160
through our strategy and the what's and the whys of it.

383
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,040
And about halfway through the meeting,

384
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,160
one of the engineers, one of the most junior engineers,

385
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,560
just took a pause and said,

386
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,600
look, I know this is what we're doing,

387
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,560
but this is absolutely the wrong direction.

388
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,720
And he didn't stop there.

389
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,760
He kept going and going and going

390
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,520
about why we were wrong and how wrong we were.

391
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,560
And I'm looking across the room

392
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,760
because this room had his boss and his boss's boss

393
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,920
and his boss's boss's boss waiting for a reaction.

394
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,200
And there was a reaction,

395
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,960
I would call it a point and counterpoint,

396
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,760
which is a very polite way to say we had a huge argument.

397
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,920
But at the end of the meeting,

398
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,640
everybody walked out like this was normal.

399
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,840
Now, I'm two weeks out of being

400
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,080
in a very traditional organization.

401
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,520
And I have to tell you, I was sitting here thinking

402
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,640
this is the most bizarre thing that I had ever seen.

403
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,120
I would hazard at Delta and frankly most large organizations

404
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,200
and many of you know what I mean here,

405
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,680
if a person to the CEO in front of their boss,

406
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,800
their boss's boss and their boss's boss's boss said

407
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,000
what these people are doing is completely wrong,

408
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,160
that person would have clearly been fired

409
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,360
by the end of the day.

410
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,920
And to be honest, maybe killed before the end of the meeting.

411
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,520
But everybody acted like this was normal.

412
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,840
And I remember going home that night and talking to my wife

413
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,600
and I said, I have come into this most bizarre,

414
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,000
strange company.

415
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,240
I've clearly been brought in to clean it up.

416
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,760
And it wasn't just this, a couple of weeks later,

417
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,640
I asked about doing a research report in an area.

418
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,560
And a couple of weeks later, when I asked about

419
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,000
where that was, the team very happily and merrily said,

420
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,200
yeah, we thought it was a bad idea.

421
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,640
So we decided not to do that.

422
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,160
So first I really like, what's like,

423
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,400
do I have like a mutiny on my tab?

424
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,520
But they're so friendly and they're like positive

425
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,240
about not doing what I told them to do.

426
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,240
And so before I had a chance to impose

427
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,560
kind of the traditional management structure,

428
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,960
which I had learned so well and honed so well,

429
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
I thought, well, you know what?

430
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,760
Red Hat's been really successful before I got there.

431
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,680
I at least need to step back and observe.

432
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,560
And so my management consulting kicked in

433
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,880
and that's what I did.

434
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,680
And I have to say, I felt a little bit,

435
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,760
like an anthropologist tossed into some odd ecosystem.

436
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,200
And I really had to hold myself back

437
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,840
from wanting to inject myself.

438
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,320
And I have to say the first few months at Red Hat

439
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,400
were, I think it's fair to say shocking.

440
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,280
It was just so different than anything

441
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,120
I'd ever been used to.

442
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,320
And I realized my role as a leader

443
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,840
was going to look nothing like

444
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,200
what I'd been used to in the past.

445
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,000
My role as a leader would look nothing like

446
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,160
what I was used to in the past.

447
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,800
And the other thing he says in there is that

448
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,920
when I came in, I started to think

449
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,200
my job was going to be to clean this up.

450
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,960
I think that is such a typical manager reaction.

451
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,760
And I don't think it is a typical reaction

452
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,040
to think maybe I'm the one that needs to change.

453
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,520
I think that's anti-typical.

454
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,480
And so when I look at IBM and I look at their leadership

455
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,040
and I look at their culture and I look at the fact

456
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,880
that they're 110 year old company,

457
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,120
I think maybe people running IBM

458
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,920
are not the right people to run Red Hat.

459
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,560
When I look at Red Hat, they're a young innovative company

460
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,800
that's had to be extremely adaptable.

461
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,000
This had to respond in internet time.

462
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
IBM has failed to do that.

463
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's why they don't have a stronghold

464
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,280
in the cloud right now.

465
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,200
That's why they needed to buy a company

466
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,240
at the expense that they paid for Red Hat.

467
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,120
Like they were desperate.

468
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,680
It was a desperate move.

469
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,800
And Whitehurst touches on one more thing.

470
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,600
He follows up on that story and it's a demonstration

471
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,680
of the kind of agility you need to have to run Red Hat.

472
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,920
Let me come back to that story about the engineer.

473
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,960
About three months after that initial conversation,

474
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,440
so I was about three and a half months on the job,

475
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,760
that same team came back to me and said,

476
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,320
you know what, it turns out he was right.

477
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,720
Circumstances have changed in the marketplace

478
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,440
and we need to now go pursue this other direction.

479
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,320
And by the way, we need to go buy a company to do it

480
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,560
and we need to go do that quickly.

481
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,080
And so let's get going.

482
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,240
And that all happened without me asking it to be revisited

483
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,080
or from some planning process.

484
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,280
It just emerged as circumstances had changed

485
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,200
and so we needed to change direction.

486
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,840
I think it's important that the people in that room,

487
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,720
not a single one of them, was apologetic or defensive.

488
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,600
They weren't like me.

489
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,560
They had been there for a while.

490
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,760
They recognized that in a volatile,

491
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,200
more dynamic environment, when circumstances change,

492
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,440
you have to be ready to change.

493
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,600
So success isn't about having the best ideas

494
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,760
or making all the right decisions.

495
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,560
Success is making a lot of decisions,

496
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,000
but being open and transparent and non-defensive enough

497
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,760
to be willing to change those decisions

498
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,120
when circumstances warrant.

499
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,520
That's what's key.

500
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,480
And I fear, although I have no guarantee,

501
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,680
I have no way to actually know for sure,

502
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,400
but I fear that perhaps IBM's leadership

503
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,200
won't be up to that particular kind of leadership challenge.

504
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,400
And if that's the case, it gives me concern long-term

505
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,520
about what kind of impact that could have on Linux

506
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,160
and particularly some of the projects

507
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,480
that Red Hat's involved in

508
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,000
that are the harder bits of work on Linux.

509
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,520
I want everybody to get a chance to jump in.

510
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,840
Wes, did you have any thoughts on that

511
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,840
before I go to the virtual log?

512
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,480
It's sad to see a strong and eloquent person

513
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,880
who can kind of describe open source

514
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,000
and how open source can work with business

515
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,240
and all of the interesting insights

516
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,720
that you just highlighted.

517
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,160
That was a big voice within IBM,

518
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,080
or at least people that had to take him seriously

519
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,000
while he was there.

520
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,560
So I think you're right that there are at least fewer

521
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,200
of those advocates now.

522
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,640
Right, and I do worry that as mergers go,

523
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,680
that could be a bad trend, but maybe not, we'll see.

524
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Perhaps IBM will simply just have too much going on

525
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,800
to care what Red Hat does.

526
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,920
Neil, what are your thoughts?

527
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,840
So I wanna bring up the counterpoint

528
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,440
that you can't be 100 plus years old

529
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,920
and not be able to have an adaptable bone in your body.

530
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,560
Companies don't survive for more than a century

531
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,680
by staying still.

532
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,880
They learn to react, they adapt and do things.

533
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,280
While I'm a little concerned personally

534
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,440
about Jim Whitehurst leaving,

535
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,160
there are all kinds of unrelated reasons

536
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,120
why he might wanna leave.

537
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,040
Maybe it is about like not being at the top like Jack said,

538
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,200
but it might also be the great resignation effect.

539
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,680
There are lots and lots of people

540
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,920
changing their focus in life.

541
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,440
But I will say that about IBM is that

542
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,520
being over 100 years old means you have to make pivots

543
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,240
and changes and adapt at a level

544
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,640
that most companies can't do.

545
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,200
And I haven't met Arvind Krishna.

546
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
I don't know anything about him,

547
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,200
but I would imagine that being at IBM for 33 years,

548
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,240
that means that he's seen IBM shift in major ways

549
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,520
over the past three decades

550
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,480
from doing mainframes to personal computers

551
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,400
to software services to business consulting

552
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,320
to the cloud and managed services

553
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,440
and all these sorts of things.

554
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,920
Like there's a ton of pivoting going on

555
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,960
in those three decades.

556
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,800
Maybe they weren't all successful,

557
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,200
but I think the more important aspect

558
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,640
is that IBM is still here and they still keep trying.

559
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,400
And yes, there's still some cause for concern.

560
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,320
I'm a little worried myself because Red Hat

561
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,920
is a fantastic leader in free and open source

562
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,880
and they do a good job of adapting

563
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,600
to their realities on the ground

564
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,080
and working to provide high quality solutions.

565
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,120
But that's not to say IBM can't do that too.

566
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,200
I think it's more of a question of whether Arvind

567
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,160
when he, as being the CEO of IBM

568
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,560
will actually learn from the Red Hat folks

569
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,400
about how he should handle the Red Hat business unit.

570
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Cause you know, like it or not,

571
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,440
Red Hat is a business unit of IBM,

572
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,720
semi-autonomous and could run on its own.

573
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,240
It has its own legal, has its own HR,

574
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,200
has its own finance, has its own executives.

575
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,680
IBM runs it somewhat independently,

576
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,400
like a lot of the other business units.

577
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,920
That's why they're business units.

578
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,400
So I would be mildly concerned,

579
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,520
but I'm also more of the wait and see camp

580
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,920
and we'll see how it goes.

581
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,400
Like IBM has been around for over a century.

582
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,240
They've gotta be doing something right.

583
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,880
Yeah, I think that's pretty reasonable.

584
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,120
That's a reasonable position.

585
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,840
And it kind of makes me hopeful

586
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,520
that they will let Red Hat be Red Hat

587
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,320
and continue to do their thing.

588
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,520
Because I think the whole ecosystem thrives

589
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,280
when we have really strong companies that are like,

590
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,880
I think of Canonical in that group

591
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,160
and I think of SUSE in that group

592
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,960
and I think of Red Hat kind of in this class of companies

593
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,240
that are doing some of the really hard work

594
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,920
that has to get done to make Linux a contender.

595
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,680
And we just want as many companies

596
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,280
in that mix as possible, I think.

597
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,000
And I hope that Red Hat can continue to do that.

598
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,600
And so that's why what we're about to talk about

599
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,000
is just, it has so many knock-on ramifications.

600
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,960
And this is part of, I think,

601
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,440
why the choice has gotten harder for server admins.

602
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,840
And I go back to just how critical

603
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,200
the server space is for Linux.

604
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,560
So it's with this change in leadership

605
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,840
that we're going to continue the conversation

606
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,680
in this episode.

607
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,520
But first,

608
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,520
linoad.com slash unplugged.

609
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,840
Go there to get $100 in credit for 60 days

610
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,480
on your new account and support the show.

611
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,720
Linoad's also making our road trip possible

612
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,640
for our team reunion.

613
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,560
We're going to all get together in Denver.

614
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,320
You're invited to Salt Lake City and Denver

615
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,360
to meet up with us.

616
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,320
Linoad's going to be there in Denver.

617
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,240
They're going to have a spot.

618
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,080
They're going to be giving out some swag

619
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,800
and perhaps some treats and goodies too.

620
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,840
So if you're going to be in the Denver area,

621
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
come out and say hi to Linoad.

622
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,000
They'll join us out there

623
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,520
because they are helping make the trip possible,

624
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,720
including some of the tech we'll be using

625
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,000
that we'll be talking about in a little bit.

626
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,040
I don't really actually, I don't know when yet,

627
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,200
but I'm working on it.

628
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,000
I'll tell you soon though,

629
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,640
and we'll tell you how they made it possible.

630
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,760
So go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for that.

631
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,720
And go to linoad.com slash unplugged

632
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,560
to get the $100 in credit for your new account.

633
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,760
We're hosting everything for JB 3.0 on Linoad.

634
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,520
I started using them almost three years ago now personally

635
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,960
because everything for JB was on different providers

636
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,280
and different infrastructure.

637
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,400
And I wanted to set up something for myself,

638
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,960
for like game servers and SSH

639
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,880
and just like my own set of things.

640
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,680
And I had seen Linoad around forever

641
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,040
making community events like our team reunion possible.

642
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,440
And so I knew that they were in the community events

643
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,240
that were like actual, real, true community events.

644
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,120
You know, not just like events that are put on

645
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,240
by like large corporations,

646
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,160
but the whole range of ones where like,

647
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,680
it's just a small community and Linoad had a booth there.

648
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,480
And there was an event I was at

649
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,800
where like they were the one booth

650
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
that was like really kind of taking the event seriously

651
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,560
and had good stuff and making great conversation.

652
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,520
While some of the other vendors

653
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520
weren't even staying at their booth,

654
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,960
they were just like off snacking on barbecue.

655
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,440
And I remembered thinking like,

656
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,280
well, you know what?

657
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,600
Linoad's really putting effort into this.

658
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,200
And they had a good looking booth and they had it down.

659
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,920
And I thought, I'm gonna try them out.

660
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,680
And so I did, and I didn't get $100 in credit.

661
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,520
I paid with my own monies and I loved it.

662
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,760
I thought they had the best dashboard out there.

663
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,960
It was nice and clean.

664
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,760
They had the fastest VPSs out there.

665
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,200
They got 11 data centers to choose from.

666
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,560
They've really got the system dialed in.

667
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,400
People often ask like,

668
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,120
well, what's the number one reason you switched to Linoad?

669
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,120
And I suppose maybe I might say

670
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,760
it's probably because of speed, maybe.

671
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,080
But now that I've used it for a while,

672
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,080
it's really because I trust running our production stuff

673
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,920
on Linoad.

674
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,320
Like when it has been crazy hot here

675
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,240
in the Pacific Northwest recently,

676
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,440
I am really glad that the stuff that makes it possible

677
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,680
for you guys to get our shows

678
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,120
and all of the services that support

679
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,520
the production of our shows,

680
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,360
I'm really glad they're up on Linoad.

681
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
And you can get a system for like $5 a month

682
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,040
and they're 35 to 50% cheaper

683
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,920
than the major cloud providers out there.

684
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,400
And it was like 120 degrees recently in the studio garage.

685
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,920
I just had to shut down our NASA, I just turned it off.

686
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,000
I turned off the modem too.

687
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,720
I mean, it was like 120 in there, right?

688
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,320
Meanwhile, the Linoad systems are sitting there

689
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,160
in their perfectly temperature controlled data centers

690
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,520
with their 40 gigabit connections,

691
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,400
just humming right along, you know?

692
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
And like, there's a lot of reasons.

693
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,400
So go try out the $100 and see what you get.

694
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,640
You know, play with it.

695
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,320
Just experiment like I did originally.

696
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,240
I was just curious.

697
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,000
I wanted to try it out,

698
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,120
but now you can do that with $100 for 60 days.

699
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,960
That's great.

700
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,200
And you can really put something up there

701
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,840
and really bang on it and see what it can do.

702
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,200
So go to linoad.com slash unplugged.

703
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,240
Get that $100 for your new account

704
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,600
and you support the show.

705
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,120
There are a lot of different options for hosting,

706
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,480
but Linoad does it all.

707
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,920
And they do it better than everybody else,

708
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,560
including their object storage, their interface

709
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,440
and their fantastic customer service.

710
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,400
linoad.com slash unplugged.

711
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,400
So let's get into the story that we cut last week.

712
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,080
We didn't cut it because it was like so spicy

713
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,520
and, you know, Wes, well, I mean, Wes did swear a lot.

714
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,360
That happened.

715
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,200
Yeah, I know.

716
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,320
I came in a little hot, whoops.

717
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,240
You get fired up about enterprise distros.

718
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,080
That's your thing.

719
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,920
I do.

720
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,840
Yeah.

721
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,960
And we actually were just gonna play it on the show.

722
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,200
It was normal because we were just talking

723
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,240
about Rocky Linux's 8.4 Gold Master.

724
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,120
And it was, you know, they'd hit their main release

725
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,200
and that was a good moment.

726
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,640
We were happy for them and thought, okay,

727
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,480
let's get it in the show.

728
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,960
You know, we'll have this,

729
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,680
we'll document the moment they actually hit the release

730
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,600
because I felt for a long time that the long tail

731
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,520
is what's really gonna reveal

732
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,440
if these enterprise distros are standing up.

733
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,320
Like what I mean by that is it's like a three

734
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,160
or four or five year game

735
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,880
before you're gonna have a really good sense

736
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,480
which one of these is a RHEL replacement, right?

737
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,120
This is the enterprise we're talking about.

738
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,920
But we wanted to cut the segment anyways

739
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,440
because we felt it was better in completion

740
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,200
to play the segment itself.

741
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,160
And then the reaction we got a little bit after that

742
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,080
that we felt was like a really good transparent conversation

743
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,320
that was informative.

744
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
And so we started the coverage.

745
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,800
I'm gonna play it for you now.

746
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,080
Talking about the initial response

747
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,240
that Rocky was seeing from their release.

748
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,720
Yeah, sounds like within 72 hours of that launch,

749
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,400
Rocky's assets have been downloaded nearly 70,000 times.

750
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,640
Hey, that sounds like some excitement out there.

751
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,560
Yeah, and that's from the mirrors

752
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,880
that they can get numbers from.

753
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,160
That doesn't really count trackers for torrents

754
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,800
or maybe other mirrors that are just providing downloads.

755
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,560
This post also took some time to clarify a little bit

756
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,640
about the structure

757
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,200
of the Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation

758
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,400
which is a public benefit corporation formed in Delaware,

759
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,800
where else, right?

760
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,400
Backed by a board of advisors with access control policies

761
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,080
that utilize the principle of least privilege

762
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,760
and separation of duty

763
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,000
so that no action can be taken unilaterally

764
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,520
not even by the owner, Gregory Kurtzler.

765
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,600
So it sounds like there's some work here to try to say,

766
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,920
look, yes, we're trying to do this above board.

767
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,320
Here's how our structure is.

768
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,720
You can decide if you like it.

769
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,800
Yeah, and so there's two key bits of information

770
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,760
in what you just told us there.

771
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,120
Number one, they're a public benefit corporation.

772
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,680
Now that's different than a charity, but it's notable.

773
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,720
We'll come back to that.

774
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,200
And number two, they are clarifying

775
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,400
that Greg is the legal owner of that foundation

776
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,320
and of Rocky Linux.

777
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,400
And so the way a public benefit corporation works

778
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,520
is after you've spent the money on what the project is,

779
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,760
the additional remaining revenue, the way I understand it

780
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,760
goes to pay out the staff, including the owner.

781
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,040
That's just important to note

782
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,840
because when we're looking at these different distributions

783
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,320
and there's gonna be several of them,

784
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,120
we need to understand how the entire structure

785
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,360
around them works.

786
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,240
How does the support model work?

787
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,680
How does the public governance model work?

788
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,440
And what is the revenue angle for each participant involved?

789
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,080
And so we start now to get some insights

790
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,600
into what maybe could be the revenue model.

791
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,920
That doesn't mean that Rocky Linux isn't great

792
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,000
and that it's not gonna be a fantastic distribution

793
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,040
because don't you want the people involved

794
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,680
to be living happy, well-off lives?

795
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,440
I mean, if they create a well-loved product

796
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,680
that is successful in the market,

797
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,600
it seems fair that they should

798
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,000
have a comfortable living from that.

799
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,360
So I don't really have a problem with the structure,

800
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,960
but I felt like we just didn't have a lot of clarity

801
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,880
in the past around the structure.

802
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,120
And now we do.

803
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,240
And now I feel like all the cards

804
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,360
are out there on the table.

805
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,560
Well, now it matters, I think,

806
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,000
how they actually communicate, right?

807
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
We've got this little clarification here,

808
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,600
but really what it comes down to is like,

809
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,560
if you're asked to give money to this foundation,

810
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,000
if you're trying to support things,

811
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,520
is it still made clear to those in the future, right?

812
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,440
That's a great point too.

813
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,520
And as long as we're all clear about it,

814
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,360
I say more power to them, move forward.

815
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,880
And I hope we continue to see this pattern of transparency.

816
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,840
And I think we've also witnessed a bit of a tweak

817
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,640
in the Rocky Linux's approach to community.

818
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,800
They seem to be pretty passionate.

819
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,880
I've heard from a couple of them

820
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,360
who wanted to kind of allay some of my concerns

821
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,360
and they approached me with a very reasonable,

822
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
friendly dialogue.

823
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,800
And we exchanged a bit of a back and forth

824
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,040
and I had a good experience there.

825
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,960
And so I like that they're taking those steps,

826
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,240
but at the same time, we have to sit back

827
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,480
and kind of watch and see how all commitments are met,

828
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,520
how this thing plays out for a long time

829
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,560
before any one particular winner is declared

830
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,120
as the traditional CentOS replacement.

831
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,160
Because really, the game is still afoot.

832
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,880
And this is just the starting line right now

833
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,960
with Rocky Linux hitting version 8.4.

834
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,040
We're just getting started.

835
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,280
Yeah, we'll see you in like four years, I guess.

836
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,160
Yeah, maybe, right?

837
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,160
I mean, Enterprise 7, I don't know how long you wait.

838
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,560
I think you just sort of sit back and watch, I suppose,

839
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,760
but it is a tricky one.

840
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,760
Now, you might not expect it,

841
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,040
but that topic provoked quite the response

842
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,080
that we thought needed to be in the show.

843
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,160
Alma Linux's community manager joined us

844
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,280
and shared his perspective after we wrapped up last week.

845
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,160
So the following discussion took place

846
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,280
on the live stream after the show.

847
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,640
And just a note, we have reached out to Rocky Linux.

848
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,160
I emailed their community contact

849
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,760
and invited them on the show.

850
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,320
I haven't heard back from them yet,

851
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,480
but that invite does remain open.

852
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,480
I think that it's kind of important to note

853
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:39,040
that the situation there seems a little bit problematic

854
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,560
because you're not any better off

855
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,000
than when Red Hat owned Centos, right?

856
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,840
I mean, it's still owned by one entity, by one person,

857
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,560
and they can decide to do whatever they wanna do with it.

858
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:57,120
Now, they can say that, yes, we have a board of advisors.

859
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,840
By the way, advisors are not directors.

860
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,040
So it doesn't mean that they really have

861
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,360
any particular say in what happens.

862
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,680
And then they can decide to do

863
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,360
whatever they want with it tomorrow.

864
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,680
So you're not any better off than when Red Hat owned Centos.

865
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,200
I think that's a very big problem.

866
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,760
Yeah, I suppose people would just argue

867
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,280
that they have more faith in the mission

868
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,760
of the Rocky Foundation than they do of Red Hat

869
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,480
to steward it, I suppose.

870
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,920
I guess that's their decision to make,

871
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,400
but yeah, it's a fair point, right?

872
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,640
So in the contrast with Alma Linux,

873
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,920
just for an example,

874
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,120
how would the decision to end producing the distribution came?

875
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,960
Say it's 25 years down the road

876
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,800
and everybody's using Fusion now.

877
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,080
How would that process work

878
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,360
with the governance model of Alma?

879
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,880
So we have a board, a governing board.

880
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,400
It's an open board.

881
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,960
We're gonna announce additional membership guidelines

882
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,760
so that additional people can join that board.

883
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,480
Think the plan is to ultimately have that be at 13 members.

884
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,720
So it'll be a nice mix of people from within the community

885
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,840
versus corporate interests as well.

886
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,840
And really just anybody that has any interest in the distro.

887
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,520
And then, let's say 25 years down the line,

888
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,040
we decided that we wanna stop making the distribution.

889
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,640
That's a decision for the board to make.

890
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,000
I'm assuming it would be proposed and there would be a vote.

891
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,280
And if the votes came back,

892
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,760
the majority or whatever it is

893
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,880
that we decided to do to vote on it,

894
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,560
and that's what the board wanted to do,

895
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,640
then things would wind down.

896
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,480
It's a vote process basically there.

897
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,200
Yeah, I mean, it's a real community process.

898
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,960
They're people that have an interest, have a say,

899
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,320
they get to decide what happens.

900
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,160
We're all in this debacle

901
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:53,040
because that's not how Santos originally was.

902
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,920
Or not originally, well, once Red Hat took over,

903
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,320
that's not how it was.

904
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,120
There was one party that held all the keys

905
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,640
and that's not really changing at all

906
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,720
with Rocky's governance model.

907
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,920
So some people might say, I think it's great

908
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,920
that they're trying to make money off it

909
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,600
and that this is the way they set it up.

910
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,040
But I just think that as a community,

911
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,440
we need to look a little bit more broadly

912
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,200
and think about what we value.

913
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,760
And to me, at least that comes back to

914
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,640
community ownership, stakeholder ownership,

915
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,640
the community gets to drive and decide what the future is.

916
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,600
That's really a very, very important point

917
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,080
that I think many people may not realize yet

918
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,280
and they may be purposely turning a blind eye.

919
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,120
As you touched on there,

920
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,720
isn't it like, doesn't the composition of that

921
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,440
kind of matter, like if it,

922
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,720
I could imagine a version where the corporate interests

923
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,760
were dominating that if they had the voting control set?

924
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,600
I can kind of speak a little bit about this

925
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,240
because the OpenSUSE project is structured similarly,

926
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,680
though it is of course owned by SUSE

927
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,040
and not legally separated, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

928
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,280
The board is actually set up in such a way

929
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,920
that it is not possible for a single corporate entity

930
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,280
to have majority membership in the board.

931
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,960
And whether that's good or bad,

932
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,960
one thing that rule basically preys on the thought pattern

933
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,400
that companies don't actually like

934
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,240
working together very much.

935
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,440
They have a hard time figuring out

936
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,840
how to collaborate at a business level.

937
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:32,160
And by making it so that there is not a path

938
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,960
for a clear majority for any particular company,

939
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,080
they would essentially have to build a coalition

940
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,160
to make something to happen,

941
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,120
which means effectively the community

942
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,360
would have to have a say in it

943
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,520
and would have to agree to it anyway.

944
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,280
Is there kind of a protection against one particular entity,

945
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,800
perhaps Cloud Linux,

946
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,400
having significant influence on the board like that?

947
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,920
Yeah, so we're actually in the process

948
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,240
of putting together the membership guidelines

949
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,200
for participation on the board.

950
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,920
And that is definitely one of the principles there.

951
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,440
I mean, our plan is to completely dilute Cloud Linux.

952
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,920
Like I know when things first came out,

953
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,160
like everything in the press said,

954
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,840
Cloud Linux, Cloud Linux, Cloud Linux.

955
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,600
Well, that's because Cloud Linux started it,

956
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,240
but the plan is to totally dilute Cloud Linux

957
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,920
and exactly like Neil was talking about,

958
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,400
it should be based off consensus

959
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,200
and based off what the community wants.

960
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,160
So that's totally what we're planning on doing.

961
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,680
Okay, so it sounds like it's not fully firm yet,

962
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,880
but it's getting worked out.

963
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,320
Let's say the board now was always meant to be provisional

964
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,320
because first of all, we need to form a structure.

965
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,400
Legal documents need to be filled out,

966
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,960
bylaws need to be set up and accepted.

967
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
So that was all meant to be provisional

968
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,920
while we work on the membership essentially.

969
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,840
And then once we have the membership in place,

970
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,760
that's when we'll have elections

971
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,320
and we will invite everybody

972
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,320
to participate in those elections.

973
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,840
Okay, I track your point earlier too.

974
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,520
I think when you see the reaction that we saw

975
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,720
when Red Hat announced that they'd be discontinuing

976
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,480
the traditional release model of CentOS,

977
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,480
people reacted in a way like they were shocked

978
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,000
at the arrangement.

979
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,040
Like all of a sudden, the reality of the arrangement

980
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,720
hit them right in the face.

981
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,960
And it does feel like one of the lessons learned

982
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,080
when you're looking back at that initial shock is,

983
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,640
oh yeah, there was a single entity

984
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,960
that was in total unilateral control ultimately

985
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,360
that could make decisions like this.

986
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,200
And if we are gonna move to something else,

987
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,240
and I think that's why a lot of people

988
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,720
looked at something like Debian,

989
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,560
even though it's a significantly big transition,

990
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,880
I think people looked at Debian and said,

991
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,400
that's a governance model that perhaps insulates

992
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,200
from these kinds of surprises.

993
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,520
And I think, so your point that you're making is,

994
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,920
if you're gonna move to another system besides CentOS,

995
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,520
and you're looking for CentOS like compatibility,

996
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,720
the governance model is something you need to consider

997
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,760
because that was what ultimately bit everyone

998
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,080
in the butt originally.

999
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,000
And if people are able to look at the board structure

1000
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,080
and see that while cloud Linux is involved,

1001
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,320
they don't necessarily control things,

1002
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,080
that I think could be a really big deal.

1003
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,840
But you have to, you're right in the sense

1004
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,280
that you have to make people aware

1005
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,200
that it's something they even need to consider

1006
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,720
because right now, what Rocky Linux has,

1007
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,360
I think going for it in a pretty powerful way

1008
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,000
is this narrative about one of the original co-founders.

1009
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,920
And because the original co-founder of this original idea

1010
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,080
is involved, that makes Rocky Linux significant.

1011
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,760
Now, I can't really throw shade on them

1012
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,680
for leveraging a positive spin,

1013
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,240
a narrative that they've been given.

1014
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,120
Like that's, they've been given a gift in that regard

1015
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,960
and they're using it.

1016
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,360
And I can't really give them a hard time for it

1017
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,440
because that's, most people would.

1018
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,760
Yeah, exactly.

1019
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,360
Well, I don't think we should give way to any spin

1020
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,640
because I think the truth is the truth.

1021
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,760
And I don't wanna get into that right now,

1022
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,000
but there's certainly been a lot of spin,

1023
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,840
which I don't wanna, that's not what I'm about.

1024
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,560
I'm about building bridges and about doing the right thing.

1025
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,120
And I think that for anyone that cares about free

1026
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,760
and open source software and cares about the community,

1027
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,440
look, I get it, I understand.

1028
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,320
People want free RHEL, right?

1029
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,000
That's what people want.

1030
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,040
And that's why everyone was up in arms

1031
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,680
because people like RHEL and people want RHEL to be free.

1032
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,320
But I think if you really care about community

1033
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,760
and you really care about free and open source software,

1034
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,920
and you really care about this movement

1035
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,320
that took close to two decades to build,

1036
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,000
to get to where we've gotten,

1037
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,120
I think you need to really take a solid look

1038
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,160
at what are the leadership structures?

1039
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,240
What are the ownership structures?

1040
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,080
And ask yourself, what does that really mean to me?

1041
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,600
If you're all about just getting free software

1042
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,960
and just taking it and running with it

1043
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,840
and doing what you wanna do with it,

1044
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,600
then I hear that argument too.

1045
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,840
But I think if you really care about things,

1046
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,280
you need to take a deeper look

1047
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,680
and really ask yourself what values you stand for

1048
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,560
and what this all means to you, and then make a decision.

1049
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,600
Yeah, and this is something that has bothered me a lot

1050
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,920
about this whole Sandhouse conversation as well, right?

1051
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,680
So I work in Fedora and I work in OpenSUSE

1052
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,000
and I work in CentOS,

1053
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,640
and all three of those are owned by corporate entities

1054
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,200
that don't really have formal legal separation.

1055
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,040
And everything is just like a promise more or less, right?

1056
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,720
I work under that structure as it is today.

1057
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,560
In general, I am fairly comfortable with that

1058
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,480
because if you understand the dynamics

1059
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,960
of what's going on in a particular,

1060
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,320
in the developer side of the community,

1061
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,400
then it tends to be fine.

1062
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,720
So in Fedora, we don't really have those conversations

1063
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,200
anymore about Fedora being its governance

1064
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,840
being problematic or whatnot, because it's clearly not.

1065
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:13,840
It's clearly been fine for almost 18 years now.

1066
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,920
It's not an issue anymore.

1067
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,200
For CentOS, the thing with them is

1068
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,360
throughout most of its history,

1069
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,200
and I don't wanna name specific examples,

1070
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,960
but throughout most of its history,

1071
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,920
it has had a very troubled governance,

1072
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,360
even before Red Hat.

1073
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,960
It has had a very troubled governance.

1074
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,720
It's been a very difficult project

1075
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,400
to maintain and bring up.

1076
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,320
And you can go back and see the specific examples.

1077
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,080
But today, something that's been consistent

1078
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,400
with the CentOS project is that the CentOS project

1079
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,480
wasn't a project for contributing to.

1080
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,000
Like when Lance Davis created the project

1081
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,280
with the others, including Greg,

1082
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,800
they made it really to be a platform

1083
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,760
that they would consume to bootstrap Chaos Linux.

1084
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,400
And Chaos was supposed to be the real platform in the end,

1085
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,840
and nobody was interested in Chaos.

1086
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,600
And so CentOS won out because people just wanted something

1087
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,480
that they would use and didn't really wanna contribute to.

1088
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,880
And that particular mindset stuck through

1089
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,200
as CentOS broke out of Chaos.

1090
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,160
And that also opens up the question,

1091
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,360
like as Jack said, what are your values?

1092
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,200
What do you stand for?

1093
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,480
What are you trying to achieve here?

1094
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,800
The biggest problem that I've always had with CentOS,

1095
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,120
the reason why it was never interesting to me

1096
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,200
up until a couple of years ago,

1097
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,520
is that there's nothing I can do with it.

1098
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,640
It was not meaningful to me as someone who wanted

1099
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,280
to make the free and open source software better

1100
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,520
and more accessible and all those sorts of things.

1101
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,920
The CentOS stream effort changes that dynamic

1102
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,280
and makes it possible to do that sort of thing

1103
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,520
without really breaking the stability promise

1104
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,920
that they offer.

1105
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,880
And the problem that I have with how all of this stuff

1106
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,960
has been going down is that nobody is thinking of it

1107
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,360
in the sense of what would make the community healthy.

1108
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,360
It's all about, what did they screw up for me?

1109
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,560
Because it is not sustainable to have one

1110
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,920
and maybe half a person building an entire distribution

1111
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,600
by themselves for everyone to consume

1112
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,800
and then complain about when something isn't exactly right

1113
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,920
or whatever.

1114
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,800
Building a Linux distribution is super difficult.

1115
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,880
And I think people had expectations

1116
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,280
that they shouldn't have had in the first place.

1117
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,040
And I know from personal experience

1118
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,200
that the substitution effect is real.

1119
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,280
And that substitution effect has created a lot more damage

1120
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,520
than I think people actually know.

1121
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,120
Like I don't wanna get into specifics about it

1122
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,160
because that's really complicated and kind of gory

1123
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,160
and that's not what I'm here to talk about.

1124
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,760
But I think this as disruptive as it is,

1125
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,240
is a good course correction.

1126
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,080
Like I sit in both the Rocky and the Alma communities

1127
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,320
and as well as being in CentOS,

1128
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,880
working in the Hyperscale SIG and stuff like that,

1129
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,320
which Hyperscale SIG,

1130
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,440
a thing that was never possible before now.

1131
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,280
Like that's a huge win.

1132
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,440
I've talked to the Alma Linux folks, Jack and many others,

1133
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,120
and something that stood out to me was Cloud Linux

1134
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,840
and other people participating in the Alma Linux community,

1135
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,520
first and foremost are actually engineers

1136
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,280
that know how to solve problems and they write code

1137
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,840
and they have a business that supports all this stuff.

1138
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,800
And they have set up themselves

1139
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,400
so that they will be able to contribute directly

1140
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,480
to CentOS Stream and to RHEL

1141
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,640
whenever something is broken with something from Red Hat.

1142
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,520
And that is something we have never, ever, ever had

1143
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,400
with a RHEL clone, ever.

1144
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,720
Really a new era, huh?

1145
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,920
Guys, that's a driving principle for us

1146
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,880
that everyone should know that.

1147
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,880
I think that there is a ton of good that can be done now

1148
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,360
that could not be done before.

1149
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,480
And I think that we're not only looking to benefit

1150
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,360
from the downstream portion of the relationship,

1151
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,160
but we really solidly feel and Neil has seen this

1152
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,800
and he's spoken to people about it.

1153
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,640
That needs to be a driving force

1154
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,640
about what a good CentOS replacement distribution

1155
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,800
needs to become in order for the community

1156
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,240
to maintain its health.

1157
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,760
And I think that that's one of our guiding principles.

1158
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,280
I hadn't really considered the fact

1159
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,440
that your role could be a significant contribution

1160
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,720
to what ultimately will land in RHEL.

1161
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,400
And by doing so, you'll be able to solve problems

1162
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,240
not just yourselves, but other RHEL users.

1163
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,560
And because the way the CentOS stream model now works

1164
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,240
is people can now make an impact at that point

1165
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,840
that'll ultimately end up in RHEL.

1166
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,080
And that being open like that,

1167
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,960
I think is the aspect of this transition to CentOS stream

1168
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,320
that the community hasn't realized yet.

1169
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,880
I think until we've moved past like December 31st

1170
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,640
or whatever the end date is,

1171
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,400
I think the community just won't wrap its head around

1172
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,080
the fundamental shift that's happened here.

1173
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,320
And so, Jack, this is my analysis, if you will.

1174
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,760
Number one, Rocky Linux got a great start

1175
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,680
with that narrative.

1176
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,320
Number two, Alma Linux, just because of the timing

1177
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,760
and just how things just naturally played out,

1178
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,720
really initially got brand recognition as Cloud Linux.

1179
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,640
And I think that's a potential headwind.

1180
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,000
Then you combine that headwind

1181
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,940
with people haven't actually realized the value

1182
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,060
of having significant engineers and contributors

1183
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,200
in the CentOS stream ecosystem yet.

1184
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,400
And so it seems to me,

1185
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,480
like it's just gonna be one of these,

1186
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,280
you'll have to grind it out and get there

1187
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,520
and sort of earn attention over time

1188
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,520
because it's sort of like the initial cards that were dealt

1189
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,760
perhaps aren't as favorable as they could have been.

1190
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,520
But ultimately, when you look at the entire picture,

1191
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,160
it seems clear, I think,

1192
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,920
what will draw people to Alma Linux.

1193
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,320
But it seems like it's gonna take a little bit

1194
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,240
for people to appreciate all the value.

1195
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,160
You're definitely true in a certain sense.

1196
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,360
And I think that the whole spin with the press

1197
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,100
was a little bit one-sided,

1198
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,000
but I mean, that's nothing that we can control, right?

1199
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,640
We can only do what we can do.

1200
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:19,000
And I think on the other end of the spectrum,

1201
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,340
we certainly have a great narrative as well.

1202
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,720
I mean, like we have core team members

1203
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,540
that have been rebuilding RHEL for almost 15 years.

1204
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,980
Like that's pretty significant.

1205
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,940
We have a ton of experience.

1206
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,720
Like we were able to rebuild eight, four

1207
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,040
in like three and a half days.

1208
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,240
That's phenomenal, you know?

1209
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,760
And I think that's one element that was also missing

1210
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,720
from the narrative overall.

1211
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,640
And I'm very comfortable with us having to earn our keep.

1212
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,760
I think we're not trying to rest on our laurels.

1213
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,120
We're not trying to spin anything.

1214
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,080
We're not trying to have people trust us blindly,

1215
00:48:59,080 --> 00:48:59,920
none of that.

1216
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,080
I think we're here to work.

1217
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,080
And the best thing we can do is continue doing that

1218
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:08,120
good work, continue being members of the community,

1219
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,200
continue building for the community,

1220
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,880
and just earn people's trust and build bridges.

1221
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,920
That's what we're all about.

1222
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,640
I think now CentOS has earned its name

1223
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,240
more than it ever has before.

1224
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,460
It is the community enterprise operating system

1225
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,720
because the community has the ability to contribute,

1226
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,880
develop, and deliver an enterprise Linux platform.

1227
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,640
We've never had that before.

1228
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,560
And I'm gonna just spread a little bit

1229
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,960
and talk about OpenSUSE too.

1230
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,280
OpenSUSE Leap is doing the same thing.

1231
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,480
Now we have both top tier enterprise Linux platforms

1232
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,280
moving their models so that they're more community centric.

1233
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,000
The Red Hat one is a little bit more painful

1234
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,560
because the user base is just worse

1235
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,840
in the sense that they are not used

1236
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,160
to actually working in the project.

1237
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,120
And now that's gonna have to change.

1238
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,580
And CentOS Stream is fine, even for the average person,

1239
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,320
not really doing much of anything with it.

1240
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,880
But it's also now, if there is a problem,

1241
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,160
there's an opportunity to fix it.

1242
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,140
That is powerful.

1243
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,380
That is important.

1244
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,880
That is how free software survives.

1245
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,920
To Neil's comment about it being actually honoring its name

1246
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,820
and being a community enterprise distribution,

1247
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:22,380
now we finally have a setup where all real derivatives

1248
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:25,280
can actually work together in the CentOS community

1249
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,900
and make the entire ecosystem better,

1250
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,540
not just their own derivative.

1251
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,420
That's something we've never had before.

1252
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,840
And also, following up from Neil's other comment

1253
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,940
about just having a handful of people working on CentOS,

1254
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,820
that's what a lot of people don't seem to understand

1255
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:40,620
is that there was never an incentive for RHEL

1256
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,980
to staff up the CentOS engineering effort at all.

1257
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,700
It was, they were kind of competing

1258
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,120
with themselves in a way.

1259
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,240
But now with the transition of making RHEL derived

1260
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,500
from CentOS in a way, now with the CentOS 9 effort,

1261
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,380
you're seeing all of these RHEL teams come together

1262
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:00,740
and work on this, and there are orders of magnitude

1263
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:04,180
more people getting involved working on it than ever before.

1264
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,720
To me, that's crucial to CentOS's long-term health,

1265
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,700
even though it's a change that not everyone likes.

1266
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,340
That was just the start of the conversation, really.

1267
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:16,220
The community of enterprise Linux is changing.

1268
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:21,220
And I think coming out into the open more than ever before.

1269
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,900
We hope Greg or anyone from Rocky Linux

1270
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,900
will take us up on our invitation

1271
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,160
and join us on an episode to chat about this more.

1272
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:34,160
Linux.entropy.works, use promo code LUB13 and save 15%.

1273
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,820
I'm so excited to have Entropy as a sponsor

1274
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,700
for Linux Unplugged because I always say shop local

1275
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,460
in the Linux community when you can.

1276
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,180
And Entropy is a development shop

1277
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,100
that puts desktop Linux first.

1278
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,860
They're an industry-leading mobile

1279
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,500
and web development studio based in the UK

1280
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,300
with global clients including Mars Wrigley,

1281
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,540
Walmart, MediaCom, the Financial Times.

1282
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,400
I mean, they're just trusted by the biggest names

1283
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,860
in media and content,

1284
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,840
but it's not all about those big global corporates either.

1285
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,160
Entropy loves working with smaller businesses and startups

1286
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,140
to realize some truly outstanding mobile desktop

1287
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,380
and web applications.

1288
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,300
They can do it all.

1289
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,860
And yeah, they run it all on Linux and open source.

1290
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:16,060
They're a team of distro hoppers and Linux hardware nerds.

1291
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,520
Everything they do goes back to love

1292
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,900
for the Linux community.

1293
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,840
Some of their key tooling includes Ruby on Rails

1294
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,780
for web development and Flutter for mobile and desktop.

1295
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,660
Yeah, yeah, that includes the Linux desktop.

1296
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,760
They've pioneered some of the most complex Flutter apps

1297
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,660
ever built and they're shipping globally.

1298
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,740
They have integrated machine learning and image recognition

1299
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,500
at the back end of these Flutter apps.

1300
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,780
They really know their stuff

1301
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,180
and I think they're pretty excited

1302
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,060
about where this all is going.

1303
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:43,980
With Flutter, Entropy rapidly builds apps for iOS,

1304
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,660
for Android and for the desktop platforms

1305
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:50,580
like Windows and Mac OS and of course, the Linux desktop.

1306
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,180
And they can do it in no time.

1307
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:54,180
In fact, they're already one of the global leaders

1308
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,300
in Flutter development with dozens of deployments

1309
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,180
in the last year alone.

1310
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:00,780
So, if you're thinking of taking the plunge

1311
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,040
into Flutter for Linux, maybe for Linux desktop

1312
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,340
or for the other platforms,

1313
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,740
or if you're a small or large business

1314
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,980
that just wanna get into the game

1315
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,540
with an outstanding app on any number of platforms,

1316
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,500
Entropy is always ready for a chat.

1317
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,980
They love to discuss your ideas

1318
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,580
and they'll just share their opinions with you

1319
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,500
even if that doesn't necessarily develop into a project.

1320
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,900
Just get in touch and chat mobile, Flutter

1321
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,540
or even ask them about their latest favorite distro.

1322
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,200
They love all that stuff.

1323
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,660
So, to get started, Entropy is offering listeners

1324
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,820
of Linux Unplugged 15% off their first project.

1325
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,980

1326
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,000
anything, you'll get 15% off.

1327
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,460

1330
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,980
and they'll get in touch and there's never any pressure.

1331
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,600
They're always happy to just discuss your project,

1332
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,020
chat about Linux or maybe even chat about

1333
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,460
your favorite Linux podcast.

1334
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:57,220
That's linux.entropy.works, promo code LUP13

1335
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,660
and a big thank you to Entropy for coming on here,

1336
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:02,980
being part of the community and helping us all shop locally

1337
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,220
for our app development.

1338
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:08,420
linux.entropy.works, promo code LUP13.

1339
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,800
Well, speaking of Flutter, we've had some feedback.

1340
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,140
Mr. Light fixture wrote back in,

1341
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,980
Hello, Chris and Wes.

1342
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,300
My initial response to Flutter as a whole

1343
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,900
had kind of been, oh great, another one of these.

1344
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,020
But as time goes on, I'm warming up to the idea

1345
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:34,100
of a ubiquitous cross-platform toolkit for designing apps

1346
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,540
that isn't dependent on the browser.

1347
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,900
Because yeah, definitely better than Electron

1348
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,760
and that whole mess.

1349
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:45,200
My first time hearing about Fuchsia, I was skeptical.

1350
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,260
The discourse at the time was about replacing Linux

1351
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,580
as a new developer darling.

1352
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,580
And so I sort of went on thinking about Zircon

1353
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:57,380
as how it would stack up directly against Linux.

1354
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,060
For a long time, I thought of it like,

1355
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,700
well, how could the Zircon kernel possibly catch up

1356
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,180
with the software integrations

1357
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:06,540
and the hardware compatibility in Linux?

1358
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,140
I mean, enough to supplant it anyway.

1359
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,500
But as you said on the show,

1360
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,580
they don't really have the same goals.

1361
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:16,740
Linux kind of tries to be everything for everyone.

1362
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:19,740
Zircon was never really meant to be a drop-in replacement.

1363
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:22,260
It has no intention of supporting everything

1364
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,020
that Linux supports.

1365
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,820
So while this new platform diverting developer time

1366
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:32,700
at large companies away from Linux is definitely a shame,

1367
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,860
I'm not sure I see a future

1368
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:37,420
where Linux will ever really be neglected.

1369
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,700
If things continue like this,

1370
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:42,380
Linux's quality of trying to be everything for everyone,

1371
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,860
I think, is almost guaranteed to have developers

1372
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:49,220
far in the future motivated to keep it alive

1373
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,100
because it'll be the only thing that does support

1374
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,920
all this esoteric stuff that just isn't profitable

1375
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,620
for the other big platforms to maintain.

1376
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:00,020
In the past, many technologies have died

1377
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,140
because they lost or maybe never had a common thread

1378
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:07,340
from which to maintain compatibility with what came after.

1379
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,600
But today, I think we're assured in a way

1380
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,980
that we'll still be able to support so many things

1381
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:15,060
as long as we still have Linux.

1382
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,660
Yeah, I've been shifting my opinion on this too, Wes.

1383
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:20,060
Mr. Lightfixer points out that,

1384
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,100
like we talked about last week,

1385
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,060
we kind of started kind of skeptical

1386
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,100
and have started to shift,

1387
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,340
and part of it was when we were playing with Fuchsia.

1388
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,460
But the other part that honestly

1389
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:28,780
made a pretty big impact on me,

1390
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:32,340
and I think it's telling, is I tried it myself.

1391
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:36,120
And I think that probably had trying Flutter

1392
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,420
and building a stupid little hello world app

1393
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:43,060
made me realize, oh man, if people had access to this,

1394
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,560
we could actually get some pretty good,

1395
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,940
pretty quick applications that weren't all Electron.

1396
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:51,420
And that I think is like the underlying thing

1397
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,700
that was really motivating me.

1398
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,540
And I don't actually still feel like Flutter

1399
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,840
is a perfect solution because some of the things

1400
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,180
that it relies on are getting a little long in the tooth.

1401
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:03,380
However, that seems like a solvable problem to me.

1402
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:06,460
And the fact that you have Google and Canonical behind it,

1403
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,300
it makes me reflect on that conversation we had

1404
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,740
with the Lutris developer.

1405
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,760
And you recall he said, for a little while,

1406
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,220
it was like Canonical was really leading

1407
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,540
with the Linux desktop.

1408
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:16,980
And so you just kind of followed what they did

1409
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,460
when Unity was kind of at its peak

1410
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:21,440
and developers didn't really know how to come into Linux.

1411
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,100
But I remember I'd have these conversations with Mike

1412
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,380
from Coder Radio too.

1413
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,860
You know, you could kind of look at what Canonical

1414
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:29,020
was doing design-wise with Unity and take clues from that.

1415
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,100
We kind of lost that recently.

1416
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:35,300
And he's still like in that mindset, the Lutris developer,

1417
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,360
he didn't know where to go from here.

1418
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,580
And I thought perhaps we're seeing Canonical recapture

1419
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,060
a little bit of that mindset and a little bit

1420
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,460
of that direction with their announcement

1421
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,900
and endorsement of Flutter.

1422
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,200
And then when I was talking with Entropy

1423
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,400
about the applications they've been building in Flutter,

1424
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,940
I started to realize like they're actually

1425
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,700
like building custom apps for businesses

1426
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,940
that want to like to have some data workload or something.

1427
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,300
Like it, maybe it might be, in this case,

1428
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,620
it was machine learning and image recognition.

1429
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:02,220
And they want to be able to run it on Mac, Windows and Linux

1430
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,900
because they have all three in their environment.

1431
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,260
That's not a necessarily uncommon thing.

1432
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:11,500
Like that could be a scenario that's kind of common

1433
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,340
in the enterprise environment.

1434
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,820
You've got multiple, multiple OSs.

1435
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,960
Maybe it's just Mac and Windows,

1436
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,860
or maybe it's just Windows and Linux.

1437
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,460
And you've got mobile in there too.

1438
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:20,740
And you want to create something

1439
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:23,420
that's essentially native on each platform.

1440
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,540
You look at your options out there.

1441
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:27,640
You've got Electron, but I don't know.

1442
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,540
I feel like things are awkward in Electron world.

1443
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,900
Microsoft seems to be in love

1444
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,360
with their edge powered web view thing.

1445
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,780
And I'm kind of done with Electron apps.

1446
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:38,140
I have been tolerant for a long time,

1447
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,820
but I'm kind of ready to have something smaller,

1448
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,640
faster and lighter and something more approachable.

1449
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,740
So I agree with Mr. Light fixture.

1450
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:47,680
I think it's worth reconsidering.

1451
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,520
No, I think you're right.

1452
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,780
I mean, there has been this question of,

1453
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:52,980
well, you want to make a desktop Linux app,

1454
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:53,860
how do you do it?

1455
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,220
There are a lot of options.

1456
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:57,500
It's hard to feel a sense of any momentum

1457
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,300
in one particular area.

1458
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,020
And then you're going to have to go dive into that thing.

1459
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,100
Maybe it should decay, you're going the cute route

1460
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,740
and figure out how do I make cross compatibility work

1461
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:07,940
and which versions do I target and how do I get it to run?

1462
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:10,440
And Flutter has a lot of answers there.

1463
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,500
And yeah, there are probably a lot of old timers

1464
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,420
or traditionalists out there,

1465
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,740
to some extent, myself included

1466
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:17,620
that view it with some skepticism,

1467
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,300
especially because of the big names involved.

1468
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:23,940
But if there does sprout a legitimate community

1469
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:26,380
of open source users developing apps,

1470
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:29,380
and if it makes these apps available on Linux,

1471
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:31,300
I think it could be quite the pragmatic win.

1472
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,900
Something has to give.

1473
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,700
I look at what Microsoft is doing

1474
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:38,060
and they've opened the floodgates for the Windows App Store.

1475
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:41,260
Any app, any payment model, any way you've built it,

1476
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:44,900
you can sell it now in the Windows App Store in Windows 11.

1477
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:48,380
And then I look at the Apple model and it's not as open,

1478
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,820
but it's if you want to build an app for the iPad

1479
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,740
and the iPhone, you can also now ship it on the Mac

1480
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,780
and you can run iPhone apps on the Mac.

1481
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:56,900
And so it opens up for developers

1482
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,900
when you're looking at potential customers with wallets,

1483
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,620
it opens it up to a lot of customers.

1484
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,900
They don't really see anything that really enables that

1485
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,380
for Linux right now,

1486
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:08,420
without some sort of enabling technology like Flutter.

1487
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,140
I'm curious, Wimpy, if you have thoughts,

1488
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,980
maybe I'm way off on this topic.

1489
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:16,420
Yeah, obviously I was involved in the early sort of stages

1490
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:20,860
of Canonical working with Google on Flutter.

1491
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:24,300
And a lot of what you're saying is obviously very true.

1492
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:27,740
Flutter is the fastest growing developer platform right now.

1493
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:32,380
And it provides an opportunity to deliver

1494
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:36,420
a developer experience on the Linux desktop

1495
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:40,540
that has a lot of developer traction behind it

1496
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:41,700
and a lot of interest.

1497
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:46,700
And I think it will become what Electron has become.

1498
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:50,980
Electron has been a great equalizer.

1499
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:55,020
I mean, you were just saying that you're over Electron,

1500
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:58,780
but because of Electron, we have a lot of applications

1501
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,980
on Linux that we wouldn't have had

1502
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,740
were it not for that cross-platform compatibility

1503
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:05,580
that it provides,

1504
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:08,580
even though it requires some sort of heavy lifting.

1505
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:13,580
Even things like Steam are based on Ceph for all of the UI,

1506
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:16,300
which is the forerunner to Electron

1507
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,980
and Spotify uses Ceph as well.

1508
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:23,580
And love it or hate it, big brand apps like Slack

1509
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,500
and what have you and Discord

1510
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,340
have enabled computing parity on the desktop

1511
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:31,740
that we've not had for a long, long time.

1512
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:36,100
And I think Flutter will be the extension of that

1513
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:38,420
because there are so many large organizations

1514
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:40,260
building their apps in Flutter now,

1515
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:42,060
and they can build their apps in Flutter

1516
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:45,260
for mobile and desktop and web.

1517
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:49,380
And I think Linux will continue to see fair treatment

1518
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,220
as a result.

1519
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,260
We have seen more games

1520
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,180
when game engines support multiple platforms

1521
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,740
and we've seen more apps as Electron has come around,

1522
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:58,140
but Popeye, I'm curious if you think

1523
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,800
maybe we're trading one evil master for another,

1524
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,900
because it's always possible

1525
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,200
that Microsoft whips Electron into shape

1526
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,520
with their edge rendering engine,

1527
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,420
and maybe they'd be a better overlord

1528
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,860
than Google is with Flutter.

1529
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:12,100
I think it's not unreasonable to hedge our bets

1530
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,980
and diversify a little bit.

1531
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:17,420
We have toolkits ourselves.

1532
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,580
We've got GTK, we've got Qt,

1533
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:23,160
we've got others to develop our own things.

1534
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,780
And yeah, I don't think it's unreasonable

1535
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:29,380
to welcome these other, as you say,

1536
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:32,820
corporate overlords at arm's length at all

1537
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:35,100
and make it possible for developers.

1538
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:38,740
Like Martin said, these technologies are popular,

1539
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:40,340
insanely popular.

1540
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:45,340
And I think it's rather blinkered not to open the door

1541
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:49,540
to have those technologies enabled on the Linux desktop

1542
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:52,500
because if we don't, then we will continue to be

1543
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,480
an also-ran and we will continue to have no-killer apps

1544
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,460
for the desktop, because right now we don't have any,

1545
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:03,460
and we don't have robust professional toolkits

1546
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:06,420
to enable people to develop them, in my mind.

1547
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,060
And I don't think it's gonna take away

1548
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:10,800
from a native GTK application, if you will,

1549
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,780
or a Qt application, because the developer

1550
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:16,060
that's gonna choose Flutter or Electron

1551
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:19,140
likely was never gonna choose those other toolkits,

1552
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:21,420
simply because of the requirements of the application.

1553
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:25,100
Maybe, that's, I mean, without speaking to each developer,

1554
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,380
I mean, you can certainly surmise that.

1555
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:31,060
It's not an unreasonable and outrageous accusation to make

1556
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:33,380
that someone probably would choose a technology

1557
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,420
that's backed by a very large company

1558
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:38,520
with a lot of comprehensive developer documentation

1559
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,740
and mindshare and developer advocates

1560
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:43,460
over something that's been around for 20 years

1561
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:48,460
and keeps changing and is not well-documented

1562
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:50,180
and there isn't a huge community.

1563
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:53,180
And by the word huge, I mean different

1564
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:56,480
from the size of the Linux community, like much larger.

1565
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,900
So I don't think it's an unreasonable suggestion

1566
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,700
to make that people would go for those technologies,

1567
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:04,420
just the same as developers went for Electron,

1568
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:09,420
because it was quick and easy to bootstrap up an application.

1569
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,120
Okay, negatives aside, it was quick and easy

1570
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,400
for people to get started.

1571
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,980
Yeah, really, I mean, I do back-end development mostly,

1572
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:18,620
some web development and I know not that much

1573
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:20,120
except as a Linux desktop user

1574
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,260
and Electron is the thing I've used

1575
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:23,620
to make handy tools for myself

1576
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:25,140
and I could see Flutter really being that

1577
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:28,220
because there's not a ton of money in desktop Linux.

1578
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:30,600
I can't take the time to become an expert in doing that

1579
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,620
unless I want it to be my main hobby.

1580
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,180
But if there are tools that are well-supported

1581
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:37,020
that let me leverage what developer time I have

1582
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:39,620
and also get it on the Linux desktop,

1583
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:41,220
that seems like a nice tool.

1584
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:44,860
We wanna get your emails, your feedback,

1585
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:46,460
let us know what you think on any topic

1586
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:50,520
or what you'd like us to cover, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1587
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,860
Last week you asked us about Landlock and we responded

1588
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:55,340
and that coverage is in this week's Linux Action News,

1589
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:59,600
along with our thoughts on the situation around Audacity

1590
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,260
and several other stories in the world of Linux this week

1591
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,860
at linuxactionnews.com.

1592
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:06,600
So really in this, I just wanted to say, just the basics,

1593
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,860
we'd love to hear from you at our contact page.

1594
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:09,980
We have the Telegram group

1595
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,420
where the conversation's going all the time,

1596
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:13,740
jupyterbroadcasting.com slash telegram.

1597
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,900
And last but not least, the Luplug.

1598
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,660
I popped in there for a little bit last Sunday

1599
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,180
as I was out for a walk.

1600
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,700
We had a great conversation in there

1601
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,980
and the Luplug goes every single Sunday at noon Pacific.

1602
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:25,460
We have it on the calendar that gets converted

1603
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:28,340
to your local time at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1604
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:30,420
And if you'd like to join our Mumble Room,

1605
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,820
get in the conversation as they're happening,

1606
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:34,540
we have information for our Mumble Room

1607
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:37,460
at linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

1608
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:40,060
The show's live on Tuesdays at noon Pacific

1609
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,480
and that's also at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

1610
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,580
to get converted in your local time.

1611
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,900
Well, earlier Neil mentioned the CentOS

1612
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:52,580
special interest group for hyperscalers

1613
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,960
and we wanted to follow up on that a bit

1614
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,540
here in the pick section.

1615
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:59,340
Davida Kavelka of Facebook

1616
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:02,940
presented at this year's CentOS Dojo at Fosdom

1617
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,780
all about this SIG's efforts,

1618
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:06,180
why it's being founded,

1619
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:08,820
and why Facebook wanted to get involved.

1620
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:10,300
CentOS runs everywhere at Facebook.

1621
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,660
It runs on all hosts and all the containers.

1622
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:16,020
75% of the fleet as of yesterday morning

1623
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:18,980
is currently running on CentOS stream eight.

1624
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:20,300
The rest is running on CentOS seven

1625
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:23,180
and is in the course of getting updated.

1626
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:26,780
We use CentOS as a stable base.

1627
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:29,940
And then for components that we want to track more quickly,

1628
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:32,900
we take backwards and we update them as needed.

1629
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,340
So for example, we do a lot of work internally with systemd.

1630
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:37,940
So for systemd, we will have an internal backward

1631
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:39,760
that we maintain that tracks systemd master

1632
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,940
and that we deploy.

1633
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,340
We also use things like Apple

1634
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,860
to get access to packages from Fedora

1635
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:46,700
and we contribute to Apple when needed.

1636
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,460
We don't run the right kernel.

1637
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:50,960
We run the upstream kernel from Linus

1638
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,800
with our internal configuration for our hardware

1639
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,340
and our kernel folks try to contribute

1640
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:57,700
to the upstream kernel directly as much as possible.

1641
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,800
That's a lot of CentOS servers running at Facebook.

1642
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,980
And so we put this in the pick this week

1643
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,980
to just kind of keep this episode on a theme

1644
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,140
because now it's beginning to look like

1645
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:08,060
there's something to at least keep an eye on,

1646
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,780
maybe grab an ISO soon.

1647
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,780
This is an interesting problem that Facebook had.

1648
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:14,300
They were taking CentOS and then essentially slapping in

1649
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:18,220
a kernel from Linus, some back ports from Fedora

1650
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:21,020
and trying to get it really modern.

1651
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:22,660
They were essentially solving the problem

1652
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,580
I was trying to solve when I switched to Gentoo

1653
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:28,120
in frustration over a decade ago in the enterprise.

1654
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,040
It's funny, it hasn't really been solved yet.

1655
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,440
But now with the way that CentOS is being built

1656
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,700
and the way it's being composed,

1657
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:36,540
there's kind of an opportunity here for different groups

1658
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:39,220
to build up these alternative ideas

1659
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:42,320
that maybe get adopted, maybe they never do.

1660
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,740
But the CentOS hyperscaler effort is building a CentOS

1661
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:48,800
with faster moving packages, some back ports in there.

1662
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,380
We're mentioning it this week because ISOs are out,

1663
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:53,740
but we're keeping an eye on it long-term

1664
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:55,940
as a possible workstation here in the studio.

1665
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:59,020
So we'll let you know, we have a link in the show notes

1666
01:07:59,020 --> 01:07:59,940
for information about that.

1667
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:02,560
I say at this phase, keep an eye on it, see where it goes.

1668
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,380
It's pretty neat to see a version of CentOS

1669
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,260
that maybe has some more current stuff in it,

1670
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:07,900
could kind of sit in that sweet spot,

1671
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,460
especially with the plasma desktop.

1672
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:12,060
If you'd like to get ahold of us on Twitter,

1673
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:14,220
this show is at Linux Unplugged.

1674
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:17,340
The whole network is on Twitter at Jupiter Signal.

1675
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:21,500
And the entire network is at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1676
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,500
We got a website now, Wes, brand new.

1677
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,560
Fancy, I think there might even be SSL.

1678
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,140
Oh gosh, I don't know about that.

1679
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,900
I think it's just a fad, so I didn't bother.

1680
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:34,200
Instead, we're just doing all of our stuff over HTTP forever.

1681
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,020
Send us your PGP keys and we'll get back to you

1682
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,460
with a signed MP3 in a couple of days.

1683
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:40,100
Yeah, good enough, good enough.

1684
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:42,780
Also, join us live, we're here every Tuesday.

1685
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:46,720
See you next week, same bad time, same bad station.

1686
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:50,060
And of course, if you haven't caught Linux Action News,

1687
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,260
you gotta go check it out this week.

1688
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:53,740
More stories, stuff that before the show,

1689
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:55,420
people are like, are you gonna talk about this?

1690
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:57,620
No, we already talked about it in Linux Action News.

1691
01:08:57,620 --> 01:08:59,740
We already talked about it, so go check that out.

1692
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:01,160
Links to everything we talked about today

1693
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:04,980
over at linuxunplugged.com slash 413,

1694
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:07,420
including our mumble room, our contact page,

1695
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:08,780
our subscriptions if you wanna get

1696
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,960
in your podcast catcher of choice.

1697
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,060
All of that's over there at the Linux Unplugged website,

1698
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:14,840
another website.

1699
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,520
You know, they're just cropping up everywhere.

1700
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,180
Somebody's gonna need to build some sort of way

1701
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:20,660
we can find them all.

1702
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,400
Anyways, thanks so much for joining us.

1703
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,540
See you right back here next Tuesday.

1704
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:40,540
We'll be right back with a new episode of Linux Unplugged.

1705
01:09:40,540 --> 01:10:04,420
ChibiTitles.com, let's go boat.

1706
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:06,460
Let's pick a title for this thing.

1707
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,740
Conversations continuing on in the chat room.

1708
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:10,780
I hope it hasn't devolved in the chat room to the point

1709
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:14,520
where we can't have an open, transparent conversation

1710
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:15,360
on the show.

1711
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,160
That would be a shame, but perhaps.

1712
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,900
Dildan, I know you had a point you wanted to make

1713
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:24,140
about Maui Plus and.NET, or Maui and.NET,

1714
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:25,900
maybe being a contender to Flutter?

1715
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:28,620
Yeah, it's a multi-platform app UI.

1716
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:33,620
It's an evolution of Xamarin using all the native toolkits.

1717
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:37,140
Does this mean I can have Tomboy back for my notes?

1718
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:37,960
Possibly.

1719
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:41,900
I missed some of those.NET applications.

1720
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:42,740
What was it?

1721
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,060
What was the one called?

1722
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:44,900
Banshee.

1723
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:45,740
Banshee, yes.

1724
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,980
Banshee was a great music player.

1725
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:52,980
Even today, I pulled it out with just a week or two ago

1726
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:57,740
because I got the nostalgia goggles and it is still,

1727
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:00,640
I think, the best jukebox that I've ever used.

1728
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,160
Yeah, I loved it.

1729
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:05,780
I actually was so happy with a lot of those early.NET apps

1730
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:10,300
and I never really quite agreed with all the mono hate,

1731
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:13,220
but I did understand the uncomfortable position

1732
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,660
and with all of the IP crap that was going on back then.

1733
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:16,500
So you gotta remember,

1734
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,460
that stuff was really in the air back then.

1735
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:21,140
I understand why it went down the way it did.

1736
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:23,220
And it makes me wonder if there isn't just

1737
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:25,420
some built-in resistance to Maui

1738
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:28,740
and just.NET apps in general still on Linux.

1739
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:31,980
Well, at least with Maui, the main complaint people have

1740
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:34,780
is that it steals the name from another toolkit

1741
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:36,140
that already exists.

1742
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:38,060
Right, right, yeah, there's that too.

1743
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:40,140
You know, there's a lot of names out there, it's hard.

1744
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:41,420
They could have picked a better name.

1745
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:43,180
It's not like they don't have an army of lawyers

1746
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:44,380
to figure this stuff out.

1747
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:45,500
Right, and a search engine

1748
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,740
to just do a kind of a quick check.

1749
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:50,140
Right, like before Microsoft announced it

1750
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:54,940
being called Maui, the original Maui from the KDE project

1751
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:57,860
was the top result and now it is not.

1752
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,720
I know how they feel.

1753
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,780
There's a group out there that have stolen my name

1754
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:06,940
and they know who they are and I'm still salty about it.
