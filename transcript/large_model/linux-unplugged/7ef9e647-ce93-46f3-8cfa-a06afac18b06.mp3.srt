1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,580
Wes can I interest you in snakeware? It's a free Linux distribution with a full Python user space

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,980
Inspired by the Commodore 64. Oh boy, you had me at Python and well the creepy name snakeware

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,900
This looks pretty cool though. You're booted directly into a Python interpreter and you can do whatever you want

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:29,900
Now you should also note that snakeware. Yeah, it doesn't use x11. Definitely not Wayland. It just writes directly to the frame buffer

5
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,320
Hello friends and welcome into 356 of your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes

6
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:54,100
Hello, Wes. I've been looking forward to hearing your take on the XPS 13 for a couple of weeks now and in my hot little hands

7
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,860
I have the Pinebook Pro. We'll tell you more about our hardware extravaganza

8
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,860
But of course, we have some community news in 356

9
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,700
I got a little clarification on what's going down with the GNOME patent suit as

10
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,940
Well as some great features landing in the latest Linux kernel. We have some feedback

11
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,780
We may even have some pics who knows but before I can get to any of that

12
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,860
I got to say hi to the guys over there in the red chairs. Hello cheese Andrew. Hello

13
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,620
Hello, thanks for bringing your own chairs guys. Mm-hmm. Yeah, of course. Yeah, I mean after what happened last week

14
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,620
I don't blame you, right? Right

15
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,180
What was so sticky there? I never figured that out. It's the honey Wes

16
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:46,020
I told you we shouldn't use the honey and also of course our virtual lug is here time appropriate. Greetings mumble room. Stay a while

17
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:52,780
Hello mumble room good to have you along had a fun virtual lug over the weekend

18
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:59,100
We'll tell you more about that and a little bit but let's start with GNOME getting a big open source

19
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:08,260
patent win now you might remember back in 2019 the dome foundation was sued by Rothschild patent imaging for violating its wireless image distribution system and

20
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,580
method patent, of course

21
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,300
Rothschild a non-practicing entity, which is

22
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,140
business speak for a patent troll has filed

23
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,300
714 lawsuits over the past six years

24
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:29,420
But now in a surprising move GNOME has won not only a release and covenant not to be sued for any Rothschild

25
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:37,420
Specific patent but a release and covenant to any software that is released under an existing open source initiative

26
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:45,020
Approved license, right? So they're essentially not going after anyone who is covered by an OSI approved license

27
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,500
So it's not completely a green light

28
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:54,460
But it's a green light for tons and tons of projects dozens many projects the Shotwell open source image organizer

29
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,700
infringed on a 2008 patent because it used an image capturing device to import and

30
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,460
Filter photographic images from cameras and then it would allow users to organize those photos and share them on social media

31
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,980
Yeah, nothing does that right right that patent would apply to just about every kind of software

32
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,280
Fortunately for no they had friends including the open invention network

33
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,220
Which we've mentioned before and is a pro Linux patent non-aggression consortium

34
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:28,540
Faced with opposition like that and the possibility of losing their patents in the lawsuit. Well Rothschild backed off

35
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,060
Making the best of it. Well, I Rothschild managing member of Rothschild Trust Holdings said

36
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,340
I'm pleased that we've managed to settle this issue

37
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:43,740
Amicably, I've always supported the innovation of open source software maintenance developers and encourage its innovation and adoption

38
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,500
Yeah, uh-huh. It sounds genuine. So Wes I had a bunch of questions about this because

39
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,300
We talked about this aspect on the show the genome

40
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,980
Foundation took some funding to fight this but then at the end of it

41
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,340
It looked like they didn't have any settlement to pay out

42
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,620
They didn't have any legal fees to necessarily pay seemed because some of that was also going to be covered

43
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,700
So I wasn't really clear on where the money it went

44
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:16,420
So I emailed Neil McGovern the executive director of the Gnome Foundation and I asked him, you know

45
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:23,220
What's happening with the money what happened with the money that was contributed and as you would expect he writes as with any court case

46
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,420
Things get expensive really fast. Although our lawyers were working on pro bono

47
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,160
There's a large number of other expenses

48
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,400
We have from court filing fees and prior art searches to even flights and hotels

49
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,520
Which I think is the aspect of these court cases

50
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,480
We don't talk a lot about and it was pretty awesome that they had lawyers working pro bono for them. I mean, that's incredible

51
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,720
No kidding. It really doesn't it show you unity there? Yeah, definitely right that you've got this, you know

52
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,840
You're all you're all working together and that we can defend the cause of open source software

53
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,240
The important thing he says he continues is I want people to know that we didn't pay RPI

54
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,900
That's the Rothschild patent imaging folks for the settlement agreement

55
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,640
They didn't receive any money from us

56
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,440
Now there is more to this settlement that wasn't

57
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:20,760
publicly available and Neil kind of hinted to that that there was more details and if you had a project that is

58
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,920
Covered by an OSI compliant license you can email him to get these details

59
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,280
But they're not otherwise publicly available. So I said, what can you tell me? What what about these things?

60
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:39,480
Can you share with me and he writes? I'm a little restrained here. Usually a settlement agreement is confidential in this particular case

61
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:47,060
I wanted to ensure that those affected by the Covenant not to sue was able to inspect the protections we had gained for them

62
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,940
Also, it shows that we didn't pay them any money

63
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,320
He goes on to say this means that I can pass on the full and unedited agreement to those who are arguably covered by the CNS

64
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,600
This means that anyone who has authored a non-trivial bit of free software can request a copy

65
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,360
But I can't just put it on a website

66
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,800
However, if you have any extra particular questions about the agreement, I can probably answer those Neil isn't that great?

67
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,920
So they didn't pay any money to RPI

68
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:21,860
They had the lawyers that were there pro bono and the community funding covered all of those extras like prior art searches flights

69
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,460
hotels all of the admin stuff for this case and the walkaway win here is an

70
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,680
Agreement that if you have an OSI compliant license, which is a lot of them

71
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:36,420
You're not gonna get sued by this patent troll. It didn't invalidate the patent which would have been the ultimate win

72
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,620
But it's pretty darn close West. Yeah, it is now the weird amount of secrecy

73
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,940
All the lawyer lawyer Lee goings on still a little disappointing and I'm not quite clear

74
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:53,140
What non-trivial piece of free software really means but it's definitely a win. Yeah, and

75
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,460
It's nice to see this happen for Shotwell who I I'm not positive

76
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,380
But I don't even believe Shotwell is part of like the default gnome core. I

77
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:09,140
Mean, I don't know if it necessarily was the gnome foundations obligation here to help, but I think they did anyway

78
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,240
I I'm not positive on that. I say this to the patent trolls

79
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,680
Leave our free software alone. Yeah, I'm flushing them down the studio toilet

80
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,080
That's where a lot of things go around here. So thank you Neal for answering those questions because you know

81
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,040
I asked him was like so what did the money go for where did the money go Neal and I gave me a very straight

82
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:33,120
Answer and I really appreciate that. Maybe let us know if you've got further questions and you know, we can drill down a little bit deeper

83
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,880
Yeah, absolutely. He left that line of communication open so I'd be willing to do that

84
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,360
but I'm very pleased to see it and

85
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,800
This is a way that larger software projects and foundations can contribute beyond

86
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,520
organizational and financial stability and it's great to see it a new kernel landed West

87
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,440
version five dot seven since we all gathered together and

88
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,000
There's many many many things in this kernel release including the new official

89
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,840
ExFAT file system driver that is the code from Samsung the good one a good one

90
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,840
Yes, but I wanted to talk about

91
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,840
The thermal pressure in the task scheduler support now because this opened my eye to a problem that I didn't fully appreciate on Linux

92
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,840
That kind of seems obvious on its face

93
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,320
When a CPU is overheating probably a common scenario for my Raspberry Pi's or for your laptop the thermal governor

94
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,680
Will usually cap the maximum CPU frequency. We're all familiar with that

95
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,520
however

96
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,320
This decreases the maximum available compute capacity of the CPU

97
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:40,240
Obviously, if a task scheduler is not immediately aware of those frequency changes

98
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
IE Linux is task scheduler

99
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,000
It will take the wrong scheduling decisions assuming that the CPU has greater computing capacity

100
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
Than it actually has

101
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,800
Never really thought about this, but the scheduler is looking at it going. This is a CPU at this speed

102
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,800
It's not aware that the governor's kicker is at this speed

103
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:06,200
A CPU at this speed it's not aware that the governor's kicked in and it keeps scheduling stuff as if that

104
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
CPU is at full capacity

105
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,200
So this release in 5.7 introduces the notion of thermal pressure

106
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:23,040
Which makes the task scheduler more aware of frequency capping and leads to better task placement among available CPUs in the event of overheating

107
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,360
Which then in turn leads to better CPU performance numbers. This is just so cool

108
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,240
I mean, we've already worked some on memory pressure getting added to the kernel

109
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,800
You know just to better understand what that's like and now that we have thermal pressure added

110
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,760
I think this is gonna be huge when at least eventually

111
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,040
I mean, you know, no one's running 5.7 at least not very many just yet

112
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,600
But once it makes its way to the distros, this is gotta be good for laptop users

113
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,760
Yeah, I think so

114
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,160
I think although it could be wrong because I'm not super familiar with the bowels of Mac OS

115
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:01,520
But I think this is similar to how the kernel task scheduler process works in Mac OS

116
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:08,400
Where it is monitoring the temperature sensors even including the ports where you plug in your power adapters

117
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:14,560
They have temperature sensors there and it's monitoring the overall chassis temperature of your laptops

118
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,880
And then this kernel task process

119
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,520
Will start eating more CPU to make the CPU is look busier to the scheduler

120
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,320
But doesn't actually reduce the frequency and keeps the thermal load lower

121
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,680
They don't expose the thermal pressure information though

122
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,920
Like this Linux API will like this is going to be a kernel level thing that also exposes that metric as information

123
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,960
So you can monitor that thermal pressure and that is an example of where Linux once once it gets a feature like this

124
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,800
It's always so much cooler. Yeah, you know, there is definitely a little bit of a barrier to get things into the kernel

125
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,160
But once they're there you've got this amazing community of folks who can all work to make it better

126
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,680
Right before we move on from new kernel features. There's a patch that is being discussed right now

127
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,640
So that's the phase this one's in just in the discussion phase

128
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,580
That is necessary to land in the Linux kernel

129
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,760
for newer

130
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,960
Windows games on wine to work properly. Wait, this is kernel stuff about Windows games

131
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,040
Yes for wine stuff, which you can maybe get a feel for why the conversations a bit awkward

132
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:27,880
But newer Windows games and even applications are making use of system call instructions from the application code without

133
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,920
resorting to the win API

134
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,640
Which is wines mega tricks and it's breaking that wine emulation support

135
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:41,000
Which is not an emulator a Linux kernel patch that it's being worked on would address this issue in the form of a system call

136
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,000
isolation

137
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,760
based on memory areas while having a smaller performance hit than say some alternatives where you do it all in user space and

138
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,440
That's pretty important when you're talking about games

139
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:59,120
So with newer Windows software, they're basically just executing system call instructions directly without going through the Windows API

140
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:06,840
So that means wine isn't able to intercept those with their implementation of the Windows API and then emulate those system calls

141
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,420
And that means those games just don't work under wine

142
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,980
Wine can't really rework its handling of every single system call. That was just trash performance

143
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,220
So that's why you basically need a Linux kernel based solution for this

144
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,900
Gabrielle Chrisman Burtazi of

145
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,340
Collabora the consulting firm that has helped valve in all kinds of these, you know

146
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:36,420
Linux gaming efforts posted an initial patch to the kernels sec comp mailing list implementing a system call isolation mechanism

147
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,100
based on memory areas

148
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,900
Sec comp which is short for a secure computing is traditionally used for Linux security matters

149
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,660
And this really isn't for security in this implementation

150
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:53,620
But sec comp already has all these mechanisms in the kernel for filtering system calls

151
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,980
So basically with this patch

152
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,940
Set comp gains an ability to sort of filter things in this new virtual memory attribute

153
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,020
That's used for tracking where in memory these calls are coming from

154
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:11,940
So since wine can set this up and basically say like yes, I know that I've set the program up with this virtual memory area

155
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:18,500
It can then use if accepted this patch and sec comp to filter all those calls and then do the patching

156
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,940
Filtering and adjustments that wine needs to do to make sure that those system calls get translated correctly

157
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,300
Wow, now they did look into using the existing sec comp filtering

158
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:35,940
But that's like a 10% performance penalty and if you just do it with isolation based on memory areas like their proposed plan

159
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,240
That's 1.5 percent and that's a lot better. Isn't it interesting to see

160
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:48,940
Windows and Linux making changes to bring each other slightly closer together in some ways and that is fascinating

161
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,100
I mean, it's no longer a you know

162
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,860
Not quite the Cold War of old anymore and you know

163
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:01,580
So many people especially with proton are using wine for playing games on Linux. So hopefully that you know with that sort of momentum

164
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:08,540
The kernel developers won't object too much. I guess we'll see but you know, this change is under a hundred lines of code

165
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:15,140
So it's not like it's muddy enough the kernel too much. Yeah, we're not talking like a huge change to Linux kernel here

166
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:21,680
I like to think about this from like 2002 Chris where I was really in the prime of my everything must be Linux

167
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,400
This would be heresy to even suggest such a thing

168
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,720
But if you look at this, it's it's not a major change

169
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,560
It opens the door to bringing even more application could bit of compatibility to Linux. It's not something we'll see immediately

170
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,760
It's not gonna land in 5-8. That's kind of too late

171
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:45,160
It may may end up in 5-9 if they go ahead with it later this year, but we'll see only a time

172
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,400
We'll tell but yeah, you're right at some point things just get tricky, especially when you're emulating

173
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,840
I mean not really emulating but you know, you're trying to pretend that you're a Windows system

174
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,500
And there's just so much going on there. And of course, that's a target that doesn't stand still

175
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,680
Wes I am excited to say that I have received my Pinebook Pro. Oh, no way awesome

176
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,720
Yep, it's a nice nice rig. I

177
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,720
Love it already. I open it up. I took it out of the box

178
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,320
I didn't have a strong immediate reaction to it because it's it just looks nice

179
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,560
It's not striking any particular way, but it's also not like ugly in any particular way. So I took out. Okay, that's great

180
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,940
Take it out of the box

181
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,200
Booted it up as I started to use it over the next few minutes. I started to realize

182
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:34,320
Oh, this is gonna be one of those devices one of those that's in my bag all the time that I carry with me

183
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
I was hoping in the back of my mind

184
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:43,020
That this would be a solid alternative something like an iPad Pro with a keyboard. That's a big ask right there

185
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,000
Well, if you look at what I use an iPad for not really because I use it for a web browser

186
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,300
I use it for a terminal a lot and

187
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,680
Telegram and chat apps. I haven't tried all the different chat apps yet, but

188
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,880
Man, is it really great? It's light

189
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:05,480
The keyboard is solid. It has way more travel to the keys than I expected for a keyboard in 2020. It's

190
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,120
so far

191
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,560
Performing very well battery wise. It's probably been off battery for

192
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:17,340
Um, uh, does it tell me no it doesn't tell me but it tells me I have eight hours of runtime left

193
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,720
So that's pretty good night. I would guesstimate that it's been off for about an hour

194
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,400
Maybe even slightly more than that. Maybe an hour and a half boy. Am I impressed now?

195
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:33,720
I know cheese you traveled with yours to system 76. So this is sort of a unit that you have

196
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,580
Extended hands-on with at this point. Are you still using it on a semi daily basis? Yeah

197
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:47,460
I mean I use it mainly for all of my 3d printing needs so slicing and you know checking out models

198
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,640
adjusting models and stuff like that and then of course, you know telegram and

199
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,480
Browsing and just general kind of couchsurfing

200
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,640
Computing, you know, so that's it seems to fit that and that niche really well

201
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,520
And yeah, you know whenever I ran it at the system 76 event for a week

202
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,960
Yeah, I was using it primarily as as a device just for that writing up some reviews

203
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,480
And you should have held it up and said guys you could just build one of these you could just well

204
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
You know, I did put it in Carl's hands

205
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,960
Good. I've showed him, you know the machine and he was actually really really surprised by the machine and

206
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:30,640
You know big up to Dan and and all the guys over at Manjaro that have put a bunch of work into this machine as well

207
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,080
Yeah, Manjaro really really sings on this thing and it makes it feel like a powerful workstation

208
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,680
It doesn't just seem like a toy. I think it seems like I've got

209
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,220
Nearly the entire Linux universe of software available to me

210
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,860
Dan is joining us today Dan. Welcome to the unplug program

211
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,480
Thank you, and then explain your role with the project before we go too far because sometimes I'm horrible at that

212
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,280
Well, I'm the you can call it lead developer of the Manjaro arm branch

213
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,960
So you are the perfect gentleman to have on the show as we are talking about this

214
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,560
I'd love to know a little bit of the background of the work

215
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,960
It went into if you anything you do know about the work

216
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,000
It went into getting this thing singing like it does on the Pine Book Pro

217
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,560
The main thing is probably the main line of the kernel

218
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,820
Oh, I bet that went into five dot seven now, but we've been running our own

219
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,800
Kernel repo branch for a while since five dot four five dot five on the Pine Book Pro

220
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,920
And so what aspects of Pine Book Pro hardware have been mainlined almost everything?

221
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,520
except the battery that's going into five dot eight and the

222
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,200
Display port alternate mode. It's also missing and suspend is missing. This is why I think

223
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:48,880
Manjaro is such a great candidate for these ARM platform devices because it's not all there yet

224
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,080
And you need something that's going to be really fresh because the stuff is inbound right now

225
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,240
We are living in the era where these fixes and the support is landing

226
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,640
But if you use a distribution that doesn't update very often its hardware support

227
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:10,240
You basically end up with a machine that isn't fully functional. Yeah. Well the previous OS was Debian and that was using a

228
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,400
Very specific kernel built on 4.4, which was specific for the Pine Book Pro

229
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,000
So that had most of the things working. So do you have a bunch of ARM?

230
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,720
SBCs around your place to I do I have a lot

231
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,800
How many do you roughly would you guesstimate I guess about 15 Wow, oh

232
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,620
Okay, are they mostly all one type or all different kinds?

233
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:39,600
Like I'm curious what you're finding to be your favorite all that like for me mine are obviously

234
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,000
I love the pi 4 and I love the rock pro 64. Yeah, those are my favorites as well

235
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,960
I have a lot of the

236
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,760
Love the pies. I have all the way back to the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 then 4 and

237
00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:00,720
I have lots of the pine 64 devices because of our partnership. They shipped them out to me, which is nice. Yeah, no kidding

238
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,040
I see you invited Dan on just to normalize your Raspberry Pi collection Chris, right?

239
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,320
Absolutely. I just got to clip this out and send it to Alex now because he's giving me a hard time

240
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:18,920
Yeah, the rock pro 64 for me was sort of a the next level of these SBCs because of that PCI Express slot and then I

241
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:24,120
When I threw the MV me drive in there and I'm sitting there getting performance that seems

242
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,340
Well, it seems absolutely comparable to an x86 system

243
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:33,340
Yeah, it's really great device and the Pine Book Pro is really close if I understand to the rock pro 64

244
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:38,400
Is there any any major deviations that you're aware of other than different ports the different ports?

245
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,840
And of course the displays and stuff, but otherwise, it's basically the same

246
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,660
Stock and board that's in it. So it also has the PCI

247
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,480
slot inside it kind of feels like the plasma desktop is

248
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,120
Sort of at the edge of what the device is comfortable performing it works for sure

249
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,680
But like I get the I get the I get kind of the chunkiness when I'm resizing windows

250
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:09,880
So why plasma as the version to ship? I love it. I'm gonna keep it, but I'm just curious what the what the thinking was

251
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,520
well, I'm a plasma guy myself, so I I was pretty hooked on getting that to work pretty good and the

252
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:24,720
GPU drivers also pretty far ahead now so they can actually run plasma. So the plasma you're running on the device

253
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,200
It's actually hardware accelerated

254
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,920
it's awesome and the login screen and lock screen looks super sharp and clean and

255
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:37,240
The when I'm logging into the desktop the progress bar. It sort of fades up from the bottom very nice and smooth

256
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:44,320
It's it's a pretty tight experience and I wouldn't have thought it'd be possible a couple of years ago. So it's it's great

257
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
I'm glad it it feels like that that

258
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,880
addition of plasma and of course the repositories available to mangero and

259
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,600
The the work that you've put into it to make it all really sing

260
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,920
It made it feel like full-fledged product not a hobby toy

261
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,600
That came with a cool arch install on it

262
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:10,640
But it made it feel like a full-fledged product that is actually competitive for what I would use a thousand dollar tablet for

263
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,000
Yeah, we were even for giving it a pretty much a desktop feel

264
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,320
It's it's remarkable for the price and and and for the and for the board

265
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,920
So as we get into the XPS 13 here in just a few moments

266
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,720
It's got I think a higher bar it has to hit now because this for what you get for around

267
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,840
$300 the Pine Book Pro gives you a great terminal experience gives you a great browser experience

268
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,240
I watched some live stream videos and Firefox on it worked just fine

269
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,240
I brought the whole thing up to date installed a ton of packages on it

270
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:47,520
Yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna say it felt like it was some super performing I 732 gigs of RAM system

271
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,040
But when I look at the relative price points and the fact that you could save a thousand dollars

272
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:59,640
And you're still getting in your terminal web browser email chat work done still feels like a real laptop with a good keyboard

273
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,200
To Wes that was the other thing that surprised me. I don't love the trackpad

274
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,560
That's my main criticism of the overall hardware

275
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,600
How have you felt she's using that trackpad for an extended period of time is that you get used to it?

276
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,480
Mmm. I'm not a huge fan of it. I would imagine that the version that you have

277
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,800
Has been flashed to have the new firmware for the trackpad

278
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
the early first

279
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,400
Shipment of those devices. It was pretty horrible. The palm rejection was really bad. I

280
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,340
Usually just hook up a little USB mouse to it and I'm fine rock and roll that way, you know

281
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,600
And it should be said too. I think Dan and you can correct me if I'm wrong here

282
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,680
You guys have already got the latest

283
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,720
Pi 8 gig working with man jar as well, right? Yeah, we have awesome

284
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,120
My 8 gig supposed to arrive tomorrow my my gig pie. So I'm looking forward to that

285
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,440
Yeah, there's that caveat cheese that if you got the Pine Book Pro in 2019

286
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,320
You need to reflash your trackpad

287
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,600
But they have instructions on their wiki and then the other caveat is that if you got one of the more recent batches of pine

288
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,360
Books like mine it came with the Wi-Fi and microphone turned off

289
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:11,200
This is actually one of the cool features of the Pine Book is you can turn these off and then there is a LED

290
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,440
Indicator to let you know if they're off or on and they ship with all of those things off in that they tested them in

291
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,400
The factory and they left them in the off configuration. So your Wi-Fi won't work out of the box

292
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,000
it's just you hold down the pine key and I think it's f11 and

293
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,080
Then if you get the two flashes of the LED your Wi-Fi is on if you get three flashes

294
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,680
Your Wi-Fi is off. Did I get that right Dan? Yeah, you just need to reboot in between them. Yes, and that too

295
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,160
Yes, thank you. You also have to reboot because I hit it and I'm like, well, where are they? I

296
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,520
Thought it'd be like airplane mode. No, no, it's hardware physically

297
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,780
Reconnecting to your OS, you know

298
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:53,100
I actually mentioned to Lucas as well that maybe that's something they should ship turned off and include

299
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:59,300
You know kind of an instructional pamphlet so that people actually know that those features are baked in

300
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:04,980
I mean the majority of us do right but secure by default. Yeah, exactly and then opt to turn them on

301
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,620
I actually I didn't turn on the others just turned the Wi-Fi back on. Oh

302
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,220
Yeah, left there left leave the camera off. I don't need the camera right now

303
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,700
I thought I should probably try it. So I'll keep using it. I'm gonna take it on the trip with me

304
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,700
it'll be kind of like my go-to

305
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,580
you know just checking up checking in on stuff machine and

306
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,360
I'll give you my thoughts after an extended review today

307
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,180
Really? We're gonna talk more about the XPS 13, which is the most recent 10th gen Intel a

308
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,900
developer workstation from Dell and it's

309
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:41,320
Gorgeous. I have been watching Wes use it as we've recorded the shows with a lot of envy

310
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,620
usually I get to review the machines, but we thought

311
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,160
Let's change it up. It's fair that West get not only get a shake at it

312
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,640
But he's got a new gig where he's setting up new machines and he had to give back his ThinkPad

313
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,900
So he's kind of in a sense. He's in the market. So before we get there

314
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480
How about a little housekeeping

315
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,840
We'd love to have you join us live just as a disclaimer though. We will not be live next Tuesday

316
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,240
We have a special episode already recorded and waiting to release

317
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,000
We will each get assigned a lightweight distribution

318
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,320
We're going to review it and then we'll have to meet a certain set of requirements

319
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,880
We'll score it based on those requirements and then we're going to try to convince each other all of the co-hosts

320
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
That our distribution is the best

321
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,360
It's a really fun episode. Yeah, that's for the June 9th

322
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,880
So we won't be here June 9th

323
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,880
But pay attention to your feed because they'll still be a new show. Exactly Linux Unplugged.com

324
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,400
Linux Unplugged.com slash subscribe also check it out. Go pay it forward cloud

325
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,840
Learners can now empower others to gain the knowledge needed for a career in the cloud

326
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:53,720
Just by getting your own certs for every cloud certification a cloud guru and Linux Academy users earn between May and June 2020

327
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,340
They're awarding an annual subscription to a person applying to receive a free a cloud guru subscription

328
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,420
So you get a cert somebody else gets a subscription. That's a nice thing to do right now

329
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:09,360
So I wanted to pass that along the luck plug goes on every single Sunday, even when I'm on the road

330
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,640
I'm by the way guys, I am gonna try to connect from the phone

331
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,680
I suppose the only variable will be if I have signal or not

332
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:21,040
Or if I have children climbing all over me, but the luck plug happens every Sunday noon Pacific

333
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,200
So that's when we do this show on Tuesdays the same bat time

334
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,400
Different bat day in the same mumble room. We just do it up in the lobby

335
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,920
to help figure out when all this is going we will soon be adding it to the calendar and

336
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,480
also

337
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,720
you can join the chat room on IRC that get shed net where the

338
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,560
Hashtag Jupiter broadcasting chat room is there's now a new room

339
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,920
Hashtag lup lug you join that you can chat in there. That's also the room everyone uses

340
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,060
During the lug so lup lug happens every single Sunday

341
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:59,620
Sometimes we may even commandeer it into a surprise show recording which may or may not have happened recently

342
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,340
But I can't say because that's in the future and that is also all of the housekeeping

343
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,420
The XPS 13 Dell's

344
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,380
2020 developer edition with 10th generation Intel CPUs

345
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,580
Super edge-to-edge screening keyboard this nice new fingerprint reader

346
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:24,020
I mean, it's definitely one of the fanciest machines we've ever had in studio

347
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:29,220
We're drooling all over it and those drill marks are easy to clean off though. So don't worry. I

348
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:35,940
Just kind of want to mention this because we often will just pass right over it. But the aesthetics of this thing

349
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,340
Are I think worth noting because to me it's striking

350
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:45,300
I mean you're sitting there with this thing and I look at it with these chamfered edges and I look at it with this gorgeous

351
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,580
keyboard and I think to myself that is a very high-end machine I

352
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:55,940
Legitimately one time glanced at it and I thought Wes is using a Mac. Oh, no. No, it's in several ways

353
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:01,500
They've exceeded what the Mac books do with the edge-to-edge screen and keyboard and the chamfered edges

354
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,460
I mean aesthetically it's it's very nice

355
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,240
I don't know if you had did you have a chance to show it to anybody else and get any reaction? Yeah, you know

356
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,180
Everyone I sent pictures to and the few folks that saw it in person from afar

357
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:19,380
But they were all impressed like it's in the Linux community, especially we're we're used to sort of settling a little bit

358
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,040
You know trying to find the right hardware that we know will work well with our you know

359
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,700
Out there operating system at times

360
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:33,080
There's no settling with this new XPS 13. Like it's just it feels great in the hand

361
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,940
It's it's definitely a lot more dense than some laptops like especially the leave me with a pro

362
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:43,660
But it feels so solid, you know, you can just really tell that it was they've been refining

363
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:49,100
Building these things over the years now that they've been working on them. Yeah, I agree with that assessment and

364
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:55,060
It kind of shows in a lot of ways. Yeah, boy. So it's a 10th generation

365
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,180
10 nanometer chipset here ice-like

366
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:04,420
It can be hard to get your hands on ice like get the 10 nanometer process from Intel because a lot of their stuff these days

367
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,420
It's still Comet Lake and 14 nanometer

368
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:11,940
It's a nice CPU. I was especially pleased with the Iris graphics installed

369
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,020
One of the first things I did was just get steam going

370
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:18,420
So no that wasn't job work, but it was a lot of fun

371
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,080
And I was pretty impressed with the wide range of games. I was able to play now

372
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,540
Not all of them are on the settings that I was used to from using a desktop

373
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,460
But they worked like there there weren't problems and they were definitely playable

374
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:34,400
which is nice because I think I think one thing that this XPS excels at is

375
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Sort of being a jack-of-all-trades

376
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,360
It's small enough to fit in your bag very comfortably

377
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,160
You hardly notice it's there even though it's not the lightest of all laptops

378
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,560
But at the same time if you've got the right dock set up, which we'll get more into

379
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:54,920
It can be almost a desktop replacement. All right, let's talk about that because I know this sounds kind of silly

380
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,960
But if I'm gonna spend I don't know maybe it's not silly

381
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,560
Maybe not

382
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:03,000
But if I'm gonna spend a good chunk of change nearly two grand or something on a laptop or maybe even 2200 after it's all

383
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,800
configured and shipped I

384
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,560
Want to be able to play a little bit of games and I want to be able to do a little bit of work

385
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:14,240
I've heard good things about the 10th generation graphics if my expectations are

386
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,200
Moderately low, but not too low. I'm gonna you think I'll be happy with the results

387
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,440
So this is the Intel Iris plus

388
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,080
G7 with three gigs of a dedicated memory there now one caveat here is by default

389
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,320
You know, it's it's a 4k screen on this laptop and it is beautiful

390
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:39,000
But the higher resolution has some cost so that will depend a lot on how far you push things in terms of the in-game

391
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,000
resolution and honestly

392
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,760
that was one of the factors I think that

393
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:50,080
Showed up a lot in several of the benchmarks from performance to battery life is just it's a big beautiful display that

394
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,160
Takes a lot of power just that's just how it works

395
00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:00,000
you know and it's it's worth it if it's it's not gonna be the laptop that has the longest battery life on the field or

396
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,280
is the fastest but it's it's in a very special middle ground between those where it's fast enough and

397
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,560
It lasts long enough. So we have the benchmark data for the limo room. We have the benchmark data for the previous XPS

398
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,160
Generation the one just before this did it stack up decently in those results?

399
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:25,060
You know, we'll have to dive more into the graphs to really tell but it's a it's a four core eight thread laptop

400
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:30,300
now you do have to do a little bit of tweaking to make sure that it's in in the performance mode in terms of the

401
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,460
CPU performance and you as well as you might want to do some battery tweaking to get it there

402
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,460
But I've been pretty impressed with the general overall performance in terms of you know

403
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,780
Running a workload spinning up a bunch of virtual machines

404
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:46,100
I also did just some some various benchmarks out of the Phronics test suite to you know

405
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:53,300
See how the system would perform under load. I did notice a couple times the desktop freezing

406
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:59,340
That was a little concerning, but it didn't take the whole computer down. I was able to just pop over to you know another term

407
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:04,540
Restart GDM and get back into my desktop and it wasn't that big of a deal but

408
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:10,540
I've heard from some other folks who've been testing out these that they've had similar experiences and that was a little concerning

409
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:16,700
Would it do that only in a load scenario or would it do that even under like idle conditions?

410
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,700
No, you know during normal use I didn't run into that at all

411
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:27,220
Yeah, that's a tricky one because even on my on my fairly powerful workstation upstairs. I would I would get desktop freezing

412
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,020
Until I switched to profile sync demon for my browser

413
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,940
Overall impressions on the way the work applications all that kind of stuff pretty good

414
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,580
It sounds like the battery life not quite what you'd want but acceptable charging all USB C

415
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,780
I assume all of that kind of standard stuff. In fact, it's only USB C, isn't it?

416
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:47,820
It is only USB C and that is something we should definitely talking to is just what ports do you got?

417
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:55,820
And you've got a micro SD to USB C that are you know Thunderbolt as well full full featured both able to charge from

418
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:01,420
So that's really nice. That's nice to see so you got you've got Thunderbolt 3 on those ports and micro SD which feels like

419
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,340
Is just an obvious

420
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:11,940
Easy addition for any laptop at this point and it's got one of those legacy 3.5 millimeter headphone ports on there

421
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,900
Wow legacy ports indeed. I know right

422
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:20,780
So if you if you pick up one of these, you're just gonna need some docks and some dongles basically

423
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,480
There's just there's no getting around it

424
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,420
I think for folks that have a newer laptop, you know before this already or maybe some setups from from various work

425
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,940
Configurations not that big of a deal

426
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:38,680
But if you've been lucky enough to hang around and just using manual, you know USB a style ports or you like physical Ethernet

427
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,820
Maybe not the configuration for you. Mm-hmm

428
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:47,820
Yeah, one big thing though in this line is you can get it with up to 32 gigs of RAM

429
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,420
And that is a huge change for the XPS line

430
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:55,380
It's great to see that especially for those of us that have a few VMs kicking around

431
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:03,000
Let's talk about what it feels like to actually use it seems like it has a pretty sizable trackpad that keyboard layout

432
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,060
I'm wondering about like I noticed that the arrow keys look like the bad version of the MacBook keyboard

433
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:14,900
How's the how's the overall like experience using that? Are you triggering the mouse more than you mean to with a trackpad that big?

434
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,460
Is that an issue, you know? No, honestly, I've been decently impressed with you know

435
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:25,420
Some of the rejection from the trackpad no no complaints and I like it a lot better than I liked the ThinkPad trackpad

436
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,820
That's for sure. Oh, really? Okay. Oh, yeah, definitely and it's not quite MacBook level

437
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:35,540
But in terms of like the actual material the build quality of the trackpad a lot of laptops use the trackpad

438
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,820
Especially if you're using it a lot. It just starts to wear out really quick

439
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,580
You know that it loses whatever surface that they put on there to make it smooth and nice for your fingers. I

440
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:49,340
Took the XPS on a little tour around Seattle. We'll have a photo gallery in the show notes

441
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,860
So I you know, I set it up

442
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,140
I couldn't go to coffee shops

443
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,660
Unfortunately

444
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:58,060
But I went to several different parks and locations around and set it up to just use it try to get some work done tethered

445
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,380
To my phone using the trackpad the whole time

446
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,540
Really one of the better trackpads I've used on Linux. It wasn't again

447
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,740
It's not like Mac level with tons of fancy gestures and all that

448
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:12,020
But really just solid basic trackpad and I've got to say the same for the keyboard

449
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,500
It's not quite ThinkPad level in that written in that term

450
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:21,940
But for just regular day-to-day use a little light programming catching up on emails sending slack messages

451
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,980
It was good enough that I just didn't think about it

452
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,020
Do you think that keyboard would bother you a year out from now? No, I don't think so

453
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:34,980
There are times it feels like maybe a little bit flimsy and the travels not super deep

454
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,740
But it's good enough that when you're using it, you just you just forget about it. It's totally fine

455
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:45,300
And once you've got it docked for a real workstation setup, I'm just gonna use a regular keyboard anyway

456
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:51,020
But that's true for basically all laptops that I use so you went the dock route. I assume, you know limited ports

457
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:57,060
It's kind of easier if you just shunt it all off into a dock. Yeah, I think you have to in the USB C lifestyle

458
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:01,860
Right you guys just you just you're gonna need a nice dock setup so that you can actually have all the peripherals you want

459
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,140
especially if you've got like a

460
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:09,820
Desktop microphone and maybe you've still got a non bluetooth mouse in play like I do at my current work from home setup

461
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,020
So it just seemed like the easiest route

462
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,300
Go plug everything in that way

463
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,880
So there were some times especially when I was I was trying to do some testing

464
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,740
As maybe you know

465
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:27,460
Like a recording workstation the lack of parts was kind of annoying because I've run Ethernet up into my recording location or I am now

466
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:33,740
I've got it all set up. And of course my audio interface is a USB a so if you're not prepared for the USB C lifestyle

467
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:38,900
There are times that you sort of forget that your computer can't cannot connect to things and can't talk to

468
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:44,660
Most of your gadgets, but if you're used to it, it's just not that big of a deal. I love your pictures

469
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,620
I'm looking at some of these pictures. I was showing them on the live stream

470
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:52,060
They're really cool. And it really does show you what a nice looking machine is. You get a good idea of that keyboard

471
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,320
But the thing that I'm not I'm not blown away by the results in the Ferronix benchmarks

472
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,980
They're good, but I'm not I'm not blown away by them. They didn't super surprise me

473
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,200
It doesn't seem like it's a a substantial performance increase

474
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,580
But it other than the RAM area where if you need more memory, it's an obvious an obvious choice

475
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,160
yeah, and this isn't some you know, it's not like the

476
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,160
The the real desktop replacement lines the precision series. It's it's not to that level, right?

477
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,880
Yeah, but you know, I was testing it out with a ton of containers running and some virtual machines

478
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,440
tons of electron apps and chrome tabs and let me tell you plenty of tabs open and

479
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,880
Compared to any of the other sort of day-to-day laptops I've used for the past couple of years

480
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,360
Wasn't breaking a sweat. What about fan noise? I was gonna get to that

481
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:45,800
When you're playing a game or spinning up a whole bunch of stuff, you will hear the fans, but it's not a bad fan

482
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:52,120
It's not shrill. It's not too, you know, whooshie. It will be there in the background, especially if you are playing a game

483
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,120
It's basically there all the time

484
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,640
But if you're listening to any of the game audio or you're you know chatting with friends on discord

485
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,920
They didn't hear it and I couldn't hear it once I put headphones in. Yeah, okay

486
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,520
I mean, that's that's how it works on a laptop

487
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:11,040
I did notice it right away, but I wasn't really put off by it and it wasn't wasn't anything like those laptops that you know

488
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,200
Have the world's tiniest fans spin up and are just screaming in your ear

489
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,760
I want to take a moment to talk about Thunderbolt 3 here because

490
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,760
This is something that really has gotten a bad rap. You know, everybody

491
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,080
Probably is aware that recently there was yet another

492
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:34,280
Security story that mentions that oh by the way, it's it's dangerous to have external access to the PCI bus Wow shocker

493
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,120
shocker

494
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:42,080
but yeah, it also is external access to the PCI bus and that makes it amazing and I have

495
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,160
some

496
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,400
Docs in the studio and in my RV that I can move between

497
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Linux I can move between

498
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:58,080
MacBooks I can move between anything that supports Thunderbolt and it's it's so great because they're not

499
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:04,400
Gimped devices that require a bunch of CPU usage to sort out messages on the USB bus

500
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:12,080
It is really PCI wired in and that means multiple monitors and GPUs and and sound cards

501
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:18,120
And it really gives you a lot of power that you can hook up into a laptop with one

502
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,880
Single cord and if you're willing to invest in that it I think tremendously expands

503
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,440
what these laptops are capable of like I just really think it's

504
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,760
It's gotten a bad rap and I know as part of a review

505
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,160
It's hard to go out and buy a whole bunch of Thunderbolt accessories because they're not cheap

506
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,320
Unfortunately, they're not but I think did you get a sense of like it's nice

507
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,200
You can hook up the monitor

508
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,460
You can hook up your mouse and keyboard to one thing the power if you have power pass through and then it's just that

509
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,400
Single cord that goes into the laptop. Yeah, you know that actually that was really nice

510
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,720
and I got myself a little Bluetooth mouse to play with too and that combination

511
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,320
Really made for a seamless sort of docking and undocking experience where I could throw it in my bag

512
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,520
Go run around and do stuff show back up at the house

513
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,400
You know when I was using the ThinkPad for better or worse

514
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,200
There were like three or four things because I actually had ports

515
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,320
so I was using the ports that I had to unplug and replug in even with USB C on there and

516
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:21,600
And with the XPS 13, yeah, it's just one cable and you're done and then you're instantly back at your legitimate setup

517
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,440
And you don't have to feel like it's some really flaky setup

518
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:29,320
Like I know I've had in the past some docks that especially with like display port pass-through for multiple monitors

519
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,600
And like they just would never wake up correctly after you know after sleeping none of those problems

520
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,160
Yeah, and you could even if it is say you're going all-in you could eventually decide

521
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,760
I really actually want to game on this thing fairly seriously and then you could go spend the ridiculous amount of money

522
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,460
It is on an eGPU and have a real powerful GPU you hook up

523
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,480
Maybe it's not 16x PCI, but it's still plenty fast to play your video game

524
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:59,600
I do it all the time and it means that you can have this tiny machine that has almost no

525
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,080
Bag debt and you know what I mean?

526
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,960
Like it just doesn't really affect your bag in terms of size it takes or weight and because it's USB C

527
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,720
You're charging it with the same charger. You're charging all of your other devices on your trip and it matters a lot

528
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,920
So if that's a situation that a rock that comes up for you from time to time or you want to have a grab-and-go

529
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,960
Situation where you just take the bag and get out and work somewhere

530
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,800
I think it really makes a big difference and I think we're now in a world where

531
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,160
The Linux version is a superior product to the Windows version

532
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:35,360
Friend of the show Jim Salter had a review of the XPS 13 and on the Windows side

533
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:41,200
There's software it comes with to manage the killer wireless card and all of this that has some trade-offs

534
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,680
that make it maybe an experience that I don't think the developer market would be interested in and

535
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:54,640
It shows you how when you buy the developer edition of this laptop. Not only do you get a great operating system, but you also

536
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,160
don't have these silly like gimmicky killer wireless management features that take a bunch of

537
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:06,840
CPU overhead and whatnot and I think that's also worth considering now is like these products are in some ways better on the Linux side

538
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:12,800
They are I mean you also get that 4k screen, which you know, I could go back and forth on it. It is so beautiful

539
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:18,360
It's a little bit much in a 13 inch laptop. I think and it definitely has some as we talked about

540
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,980
complications for the battery life and some other issues, but

541
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:28,480
It's just it's so nice to see the Sputnik program have gotten this far that we have this developer focused machine

542
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,920
that really does feel like it with 32 gigs of RAM and a first-class experience all around and

543
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,000
Up on to shipping on it right out of the box. Was it 1804 that it shipped with do you recall?

544
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I know we kind of we nuked and paved fairly quick. We very quickly got rid of that

545
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,720
It did ship with 1804 and that worked fine

546
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:53,020
But I wanted to own to try 2004 on it because that's that's the new hotness and it works great now

547
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:59,600
One thing people been asking about with this machine is the fingerprint reader. Yeah, that doesn't work quite yet

548
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,400
I haven't found any official updates about when that will be available. If you look at the Dell website and Barton

549
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,920
George's original post on his blog. They mentioned that that will come out sometime mid 2020

550
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,000
So I think we're in that range anytime. It should be an over-the-air update

551
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:20,400
Just some firmware that gets added support and a new driver available for Linux. Not there yet, though

552
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,360
maybe a combination of an FW up D and

553
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,920
a point release of

554
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,120
2004 yeah, I think so because you can see it there, you know if you do LS USB

555
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,960
It shows right up and you get all the driver information and they have promised that you know

556
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,520
They've been working with the hardware vendor. This should be coming down the pipe, but so far not there yet

557
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,200
Which is a little disappointing because I was excited because in 24

558
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:47,440
They've got the the genome changes in that you can you can add fingerprint support just right there in the genome settings

559
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:52,760
Which is pretty cool. It's a nice fingerprint reader. It's a it's like a big padded button

560
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,880
It's not your old swipey fingerprint reader. No, it is not and it actually doubles

561
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,440
It's the power button which feels a little modern

562
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,360
Maybe too modern takes a little bit to get used to but is pretty cool. Don't change West Pains power button

563
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,360
It spooks them now this thing doesn't it?

564
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:14,040
Technically have support for the Windows. Hello style face ID style login. Yes, it does

565
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,800
So it has the infrared

566
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,640
Sensors needed to do that right next to the webcam and we should note

567
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,200
Unlike the old days of staring up your nose on a webcam call

568
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,480
This XPS has the camera in the usual spot on the top of the display

569
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,360
It is only 720p, but honestly, it's fine. You know, I did so I did some work calls

570
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:40,040
Did some gaming with friends some zoom calls. No one complained. No one said anything. The webcam is good enough

571
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,800
I can't believe they managed to fit a webcam up there. Oh, I know it's it's shockingly small

572
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,720
You hardly believe it

573
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,940
It was I tried to take a picture of it

574
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:50,240
But that was hard to because it's just it's just a tiny little bezel

575
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,860
You could kind of see it in your picture

576
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:56,080
So I do you got to check this out go check out the photo gallery because it's it's remarkable

577
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,280
They fit it in there along with the IR sensor

578
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:04,280
Also, it's it's it gives you a better concept of what we're saying when it's edge to edge screen and edge to edge keyboard it

579
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:09,140
It really feels like every scrap of space in that machine is used

580
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:15,560
Nothing has gone to waste on the design and space of that machine. So you were mentioning the Windows style. Hello

581
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:19,600
So this gave me a good opportunity to try some open source software called howdy

582
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,760
Oh, really and howdy provides Windows Hello style

583
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,600
Authentication for Linux and it's actually pretty cool because it ties into PAM

584
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:30,780
So if you want to do pseudo you can use your face to do it now

585
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,900
I'm not saying you should do this is probably not a good security posture

586
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,020
But it was really neat to see this actually work on Linux. There's a PPA out there if you want to go install it

587
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:45,620
They've got packages available for Ubuntu add that install it and then it's got a handy little guy that will guide you through

588
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:52,800
Registering your face getting that enrolled and then it downloads all the necessary machine learning models sets things up for you

589
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:59,280
You're done. Say you were going to buy this thing you get there's two base models. They start with a

590
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:07,760
$1,000 model and a $1,400 model they both come with the 10th gen processors ones and I five and I seven

591
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,920
I want to price this out and see if you'd actually buy it now that you've used it

592
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,760
Would you get the i5 model for Westpain or would you get the i7 model?

593
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,320
You know, that's a tough one. I might be tempted to just stick with the i5

594
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:23,440
I could see it's reasonable and in a laptop. You're probably not gonna see a huge difference. That's just it

595
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,680
I mean if you're using this thing, you're gonna throw it in the closet never be around it

596
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,800
It's gonna have its fan going and it'll be cooled and you're busy on the CPU all the time

597
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,440
Then okay, maybe you want the i7 but I don't think you'll notice just what the i5 for whatever reason

598
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:41,420
I think when you get the i5 you cannot do 32 gigs of RAM with a Dell configurator at this time

599
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,340
So are you okay with 16 gigs or would you stick with eight?

600
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:49,940
What's your choice be I don't think I could buy a new laptop that only had eight gigs in 2020

601
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:53,920
It's $100 to go up to 16. So the display has two options

602
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,160
Now the one we got in-house to review is the UHD plus 4k infinity edge touch

603
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,760
Anti-reflective 500 nit display. I mean it's like

604
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:08,120
Gorgeous on a laptop. However, you can get that same chassis

605
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,320
with the infinity edge display at

606
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,520
1920 by 1200 and it's actually

607
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,880
$400 cheaper that I would be tempted for I mean the 4k is beautiful

608
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,000
But honestly just for like simple Linux desktop stuff and since I'm not, you know

609
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,840
I wasn't using it for doing any sort of like content creation in terms of photo or video work

610
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:33,680
The smaller resolution would be fine for just when I'm in the terminal

611
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:39,480
1920 by 1200 is a great resolution. It's a great resolution and it'll save you some battery life

612
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,880
I'd love to see a 2k option, but they have an anti-reflective

613
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:48,080
Version of that 1920 by 1200 for an additional $100. I don't know

614
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:55,680
That's a tough call but at the storage level by base. It's 256. I'd kind of advise you bump it to a terabyte for 250 bucks

615
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:01,480
I don't know what your thoughts are though. Maybe 512 or 256 is enough for Wes 256

616
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,880
Not not anymore. I think that that fits in the 8 512

617
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,760
I can live with especially if it's you know, you build your workflow around it

618
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,360
You just know that you're gonna need a scratch disk attack to your dock somewhere or you're doing everything in the cloud

619
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:18,760
Anyway, those are all workable. You've got Thunderbolt. You've got you've got cloud storage. You can always build the NAS

620
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:23,640
So ok 512 m.2 for 100 bucks more. All right, Wes

621
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:31,020
Are you ready for your final price this by the way is with the base warranty one-year pro support

622
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:38,560
And no additional damage and at any kind of like office software. No office software. No antivirus, please

623
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,520
your grand total comes to

624
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:50,400
1249 dollars and 99 cents. So let's just say maybe 13

625
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,040
14 hundred dollars after sales tax or whatnots shipping is free

626
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:59,480
Let's round up just to make it a little easier. Would you pay 14 hundred dollars all-in?

627
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:07,480
For the laptop you have right now. Yeah, you know, I really think that I would it's just it has fallen into my lifestyle

628
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,880
So well, you know, it doesn't do really any one thing

629
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,960
Better than anything else necessarily, but it is remarkably well rounded

630
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:21,640
I feels comfortable just throwing it on the couch and using it while you're watching TV and it feels comfortable

631
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:26,440
It's like a primary development workstation. That's a hard thing to get right and

632
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:33,080
Make it a laptop that I'm proud to show off as I'm walking around and I gotta say you and I both having been

633
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:38,700
XPS owners, I think we both have some very old XPS is that still boot up and run

634
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,800
And they have no right to be doing so at this point. Yes

635
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,720
Now unfortunately, you do kind of have to make the the Mac style calculus of how much more am I gonna spend to try?

636
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,560
To future-proof this thing, but you're right

637
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:55,000
I have no doubt that this will still be especially given the build quality of the thing a

638
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,300
Great laptop in four years time. So before tax this thing came out to essentially

639
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:08,520
Thousand two hundred fifty dollars and for that it was a 10th gen i5 up to three point six gigahertz boost

640
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,280
It came with Ubuntu pre-installed

641
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,520
16 gigabytes of DDR4 low-power RAM a

642
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,840
1920 by 1200

643
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,840
FHD plus edge-to-edge

644
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,920
500 nit display a

645
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:28,700
512 gigabyte PCI MVME solid-state disk the killer Wi-Fi ATX 1650 which is legitimately

646
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,880
Supposedly a very good Wi-Fi chip

647
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:37,280
I poked fun earlier and also those Intel UHD graphics that come with that 10th gen Intel i5 and

648
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:43,360
on the mid-range area a 4-cell 52 watt-hour battery in the

649
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:48,080
fully nice shiny platinum silver with black carbon fiber

650
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,000
design

651
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
You get all that for

652
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:57,560
1250 plus tax that does seem like a pretty strong value

653
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:01,720
I don't know if it's the end-all machine for everybody because they have made some very

654
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:07,680
Serious decisions and how you can use the machine and and that I think is where the compromise lies

655
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,640
But outside of that, I think it's very compelling now

656
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:15,720
It'd be another $400 to go with the 4k display, but I like your build a little bit better Wes

657
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,900
yeah, I do too, honestly, that's very

658
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,480
tempting because it's just

659
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:26,920
It fits it does what you need and I love that Dell is making these with Linux just pre-installed

660
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:31,160
I think that it's it's great to be able to support that if you can and send that signal like

661
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:38,080
Yes, keep doing that. Yeah, the team's got to be super proud of this machine looking backwards come, you know, it's funny to you

662
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,320
you mentioned the Wi-Fi there and

663
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,880
All of Jim's problems with the Wi-Fi was on Windows and it turns out

664
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:50,280
It's a totally fine Wi-Fi chip with Wi-Fi 6 support and when you just use the in kernel driver for it

665
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,520
I mean kernel 5.1 or later you won't notice the thing

666
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:59,800
I think that's another way in which it is a superior product using Linux for people that just want to get their work done

667
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,360
Well, that means we have to box it back up and send it back to Dell now

668
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:08,360
But it was it was neat to see it. And this is really prompt

669
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,840
I mean we say it every time but

670
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,280
They really just keep iterating on this product

671
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,680
and so if you buy in at a certain generation there is a

672
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:23,000
Really good indication that when you're ready to rebuy in how many years has it been for us seven years since you bought your XPS?

673
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,760
Whoo. Yes

674
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:28,160
you know though that you can now go back to that same product line and

675
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:34,320
There's continuity there and that there's very likely at this point that if say you bought another laptop and four to seven years

676
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,680
There could be another one in that product line and there's something to that. That's just it as I think they've shown

677
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,400
Excellent stewardship of the line, you know, it hasn't really betrayed us yet

678
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,800
It hasn't just really sacrificed quality

679
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:53,580
If anything they've continued to invest in the quality of this of the hardware of the setup of thinking thoughtfully about how to configure these

680
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:59,660
Machines with things like adding 32 gig support with finally working on drivers for fingerprint readers for Linux

681
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,920
Those are all good things and I expect we'll see them to continue

682
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,920
Yeah, and you really can't argue with that price

683
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:12,880
$1,300 or if you want to round up $1,400 all-in for decent hardware

684
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:20,400
But what is not in that price but is included is the design of the chassis that edge-to-edge screen that huge trackpad

685
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:27,800
I think it's I think I agree with Wes. I think it's likely the best trackpad shipping on a Linux pre-installed laptop right now

686
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,960
We've talked about the beauty and niceness of sort of the machining and the build of the chassis

687
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:38,960
But it also just feels very sturdy and reliable as I was walking around with it using it around like I wasn't worried about damaging

688
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,240
It had a great feel in the hand and the hinges were really solid

689
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,800
Which is one thing that I really bugs me on a lot of laptops

690
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,680
Even if it's a good laptop supports Linux

691
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:51,160
Well, you can just tell that those hinges are really gonna wear out and after a year or two

692
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,440
You're just gonna have a floppy screen that you have to prop up. Yep. Absolutely. Well, thank you Wes now

693
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:00,440
before we run out of time I wanted to do a little follow-up on my data loss crisis and

694
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:07,160
Answer I'm a question that I'm sure was common in a lot of listeners minds Jameson wrote in and he said

695
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:13,280
Why not build all of what you just tried to do with butter FS on LVM and XFS?

696
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,800
I know it requires a bit of stacking of technology and different tools to manage

697
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:21,320
But there isn't much you can do on LVM that you can do on butter FS and ZFS these days

698
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:28,840
And I think that was probably everyone's probably wondering why I didn't go with XFS. I was I was specifically trying to

699
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:33,160
Use butter FS. That was a choice. I made there was a couple of things that played into it

700
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,720
Number one is I do like to do it as low-level to the system as possible

701
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,620
So that's bias number one is I don't like a lot of tools stacked on top of it

702
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:47,760
I love the concept of an all-inclusive file system that's built into my operating system kernel

703
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,240
That has the tools to do these things for me all about that monolith

704
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,540
Yeah, man, and these things being I want drobo like capacity to just add

705
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:03,040
Dis so I have production discs that we may retire out of production

706
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,860
This is not an actual scenario that exists right now

707
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,120
but in the future we will have

708
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:12,320
discs that will want to retire out of production and I could take some of those and just add them to an existing

709
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:19,240
Group storage pool with butter FS very simply for just scratch projects. I have I have no concern if the data loss occurs

710
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:24,800
there's a very simple butter FS add volume command that just grows a mount point and

711
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,040
That's a very appealing technology

712
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:33,920
so I wanted to learn and experiment with that as well if I was building something that I wanted absolute stability and

713
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,160
predictability and that I never touched again, I

714
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,600
Probably would have gone with LVM and XFS

715
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,880
That's that's generally my go-to strategy for like a server setup

716
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:50,960
or if it was a more powerful x86 system probably would have gone with a

717
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,060
Isolated OS and then ZFS pool approach like we do here in the studio, you know

718
00:56:56,060 --> 00:57:02,120
But it is a good point by Jameson here writing in which thank you LVM, especially with thin provisioning and the snapshot capabilities

719
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:07,200
As a lot of these features and XFS 2 is growing copy-on-write abilities as well

720
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:13,040
So they have not stood still and I think we've seen too with things like project Stratus that there are a lot of those

721
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:13,760
capabilities

722
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,560
But you're right to my mind a lot of the big wins with things like butter fast and CFS

723
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,360
You you just have the one interface for it

724
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:24,680
You don't have to manage multiple different projects and how they interact and really understand it

725
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:31,700
You just got to rely on using the one tool correctly, even if sometimes with butter FS. That's tricky. Yeah, that's it and

726
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,840
On a Raspberry Pi there is less overhead available

727
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:42,360
so I really want to do something as low level as possible the other thing that I find appealing about butter FS is

728
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:50,600
Besides its SSD trim support and things like that is I can individually turn off copy-on-write for a directory of things

729
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:55,200
There's some compelling reasons perhaps on a docker container to turn off copy-on-write

730
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,480
Although there's advantages to for snaps

731
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,740
There's advantages of having butter first for snapshotting there too

732
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,720
but anyways actually where I where I don't really intend to use copy-on-write is these

733
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,080
five

734
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:11,520
Plus gigabyte media files that can be you know up to 20 25 gigabyte MKV files

735
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:17,360
I don't really want copy-on-write on USB media for those and I can turn that off just with a

736
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,440
Directory attribute with butter FS. Yeah, that's pretty nice

737
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:24,060
But you can you know, you can still get some of the other nice features of butter FS at the same time

738
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:29,480
Yeah, exactly and I can do this drobo style mismatch disk sizes

739
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:37,200
over time which is probably a recipe for horrible disaster unless I bring some kind of raid into the mix which

740
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,000
I'm not super inclined to do with butter FS

741
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:45,800
But I'm also doing it with files that assuming my backups are working correctly are all

742
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,320
Restorable the applications are all in containers. The data is all backed up here at the studio

743
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:56,720
So it's all recoverable and I am happy to say it is all back up and running and like what happens anytime one of these

744
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:02,560
Catastrophes happen and you rebuild you rebuild with lessons learned and so now I like the new setup

745
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,680
Even more than I liked the old setup

746
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:10,360
So I'm feeling pretty good at this point all about it all I am using the crazy butter FS setup

747
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:14,120
I after I rebuilt everything I went back to butter FS from the start this time

748
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:20,200
No file system conversion shenanigans and I did the volume add so I have now combined two

749
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,160
1TB

750
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,240
MVME SSDs as a

751
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,920
a

752
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:32,760
2TB storage pool that is available for my media and I love solid-state media in the RV because I'm going down the road

753
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,760
you know, it's it's a they say it's like a

754
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:39,280
4 on the Richter scale for an earthquake for everything in the RV as you're going down the road

755
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:44,520
So obviously spinning rust is out mind those platters. Yeah, and so my kids are watching TV

756
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:49,640
Well, I'm going down the road and I'm serving up media and doing the encoding I'm streaming it and I don't want to be running

757
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:55,840
off of platters so that's where this kind of technology where I'm adding fairly reliable disks and

758
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:01,080
The use case scenario is our media server goes out or I can't get to my notes

759
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:08,200
Makes the stakes low enough that I'm comfortable experimenting with raspberry pies and with butter FS

760
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:16,080
Because it's a great learning opportunity and nothing truly teaches you like actually using something in a scenario where you kind of depend on it

761
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:21,160
That's why I was glad to see you picked butter FS. Honestly, is it it's just nice to use some of these times because we've

762
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,560
Deployed it a little bit at the studio

763
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:27,020
I've still got a storage pool at my house that's using it and I haven't sent seem to need to replace and

764
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,360
It's good to remember that it's in the kernel. It's being updated and maintained. It hasn't stood still

765
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,780
So it's good for us to keep a rest of the changes and for me

766
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:41,240
It's like okay if I was gonna rebuild say the file server here in the studio again something god forbid happened

767
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:46,500
I'd go ZFS again. I wouldn't be experimenting with butter FS there, but at the same time

768
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:50,440
I don't want to be ignorant to what it's capable of and because I have been critical of it in the past

769
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:54,880
I think it's important that I check in on it from time to time and update my

770
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,280
understanding of what it's capable of because otherwise I just become one of those

771
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,980
jackasses on the internet that

772
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:06,340
Criticizes things for 15 years and never updates their opinions and never tries things out and that's just annoying. We wouldn't want that

773
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:11,620
All right, mr. Payne. Well, I think that wraps us up this week Linux unplug calm slash three five six

774
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:14,900
You can go to Linux unplug calm slash contact to send us your feedback

775
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:22,780
Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar if you want to find out when we'll be here alive could mention the Twitter handle at Linux unplug

776
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:28,780
The network is at Jupiter signal. I'm at Chris glass. He's at West Payne and thank you for being here

777
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:36,900
That's what really matters and we'll see you back here next Tuesday

778
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,780
You

779
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:12,460
Know I was looking at the specs for that XPS. It was pretty surprised

780
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:19,700
2.6 pounds. Yeah, it's definitely dense because it's you know, so just small in a 13 inch platform

781
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:22,700
But it feel it just feels very sturdy. And yeah, I threw it up through my bag

782
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:27,680
Didn't feel different than having an empty bag. It kind of feels like it's all one solid device

783
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,400
It does feel like that

784
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,720
Could you open it with just one finger or did you have to hold the base down as well?

785
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:39,360
So that I found depends a little bit on what surface they've got some pretty good little grippies on the bottom there

786
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,940
So on most normal surfaces, yes

787
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,640
Holding it in my hand also

788
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:44,880
Yes

789
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:51,480
but the the hardest part is just like the angle on the screen and it's like at the ends of the screen is thicker than

790
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:57,800
Like the taper on the bottom part of the laptop. So the hardest part is just getting that first crack going

791
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:03,760
They don't have the little cutout like the older MacBooks did got you but once it's open a little bit then it works really nice

792
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,920
Yeah, that's the tricky thing. I tried that probably too much

793
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:21,680
I was just playing with it because the hinge is so smooth. It was fun to mess with
