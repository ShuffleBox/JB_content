1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,780
Hey Wes, did you hear the good news?

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,900
No, I don't think so.

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,700
Wait, unless you mean Nano 5.5,

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,140
but that can't be it, right?

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,920
Nano 5.5 Rebecca is out.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,720
Clearly one of the most accomplished pieces of software

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,680
with one of the most monumental releases

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,400
in free software history.

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,120
GNU Nano 5.5 has a new mini bar which will blow you away.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,860
It has a new prompt color which will change your life.

11
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,040
And it has a new set mark match option

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,360
that highlights the result of a successful search

13
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,080
that's gonna change the way you search a Nano document.

14
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,240
And they've also brought a no-wrap toggle.

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,260
It's Nano, but not like you know it.

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,660
It's all new, it's brand new, and it's here to dominate Vi.

17
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,880
Vim?

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,720
Emacs?

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,640
You know what stood out to me with this release, Chris?

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,480
What?

21
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,820
Absolutely nothing.

22
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,820
Well, hello friends, and welcome

23
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,640
into your weekly Linux talk show.

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,720
My name is Chris.

25
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,680
My name is Wes.

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,520
Hello, Wes.

27
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,160
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru,

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,560
the leader in hands-on cloud learning.

29
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,000
The only way to lock in a new skill is by doing.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,400
That's what it says right here.

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,380
And you can get your hands cloudy at cloudguru.com.

32
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,560
You know it's true, because it's written down.

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,760
This is episode 389, which if I recall,

34
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,920
is also the LDAP port number.

35
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,960
So this is episode LDAP, Wes.

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,800
Perfect.

37
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,920
It really is.

38
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,480
And also you're absolutely wrong about that Nano thing.

39
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,800
It cuts deep, and I will never forgive.

40
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,020
I mean, it's nice to have stable stuff too, right?

41
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,660
I don't need breaking features

42
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,560
and all kinds of changes each time.

43
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,360
Nano just works, and that's probably

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,040
what you want in a text editor.

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,580
Probably, probably.

46
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,960
But we actually have a really, really fun tool

47
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,000
that we're gonna talk about today

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,400
that's gonna change your Linux game

49
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,480
from this episode forever.

50
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,540
It's a way to enable your distro hopping habit

51
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,720
in a way that may be frankly irresponsible

52
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,300
for us to tell you about, but we're gonna do it anyways.

53
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,720
But before we get there,

54
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,820
we're gonna get to the community news.

55
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,280
And to do that, we gotta say time appropriate greetings

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,120
to our Mumble Room.

57
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,040
Hello, Virtual Lug.

58
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,880
Hello.

59
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,280
Howdy.

60
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,720
Hello, everybody.

61
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,920
It's really nice to see all of you.

62
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,600
We got a good crew in there.

63
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,160
They've joined us by going to linuxunplug.com,

64
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,040
clicking our Mumble link,

65
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,000
and getting the deets to connect in.

66
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,760
And Mumble's free software is high quality,

67
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,280
and it's also the lowest latency way

68
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,520
to listen to some of our live streams.

69
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,520
So welcome to episode LDAP.

70
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,320
Guys, are you ready to get started?

71
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,580
Excited.

72
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,920
All right, well, let's talk about something

73
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,000
that I didn't really know, and I feel kind of embarrassed,

74
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,760
but it's changing, so I'll just pretend

75
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,160
like I knew all along that Ubuntu

76
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,360
had world-readable home directories.

77
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,680
And that's changing in Ubuntu 21.04.

78
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,760
They're doing away with this existing practice,

79
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,880
and they're making new user home directories,

80
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,780
I guess, no longer world-readable.

81
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,440
What, Wes, how could this possibly be a thing?

82
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,600
Yeah, okay, well, up to now,

83
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,800
when you made a new home directory,

84
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,080
they were created with 7.5.5 as the permissions.

85
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,840
With this proposed change, it would be 7.5.0.

86
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,500
And if you don't speak octal, well, currently 7.5.5,

87
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,640
that's read, write, execute for the owner,

88
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,340
read and execute for the group,

89
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,080
but also for everybody else.

90
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,840
So with 7.5.0, now it's read, write, execute for the owner,

91
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,260
read and execute for the group,

92
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,680
and nada for everybody else.

93
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,880
Yeah, so I guess at least going back to 2006,

94
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,680
there'd been people that have been asking about this,

95
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,560
and I just somehow even missed that this was a thing.

96
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,280
The original logic seems to be that multi-user systems

97
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,040
had some level of cooperation amongst the users anyways,

98
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,960
and this made it easier, yeah, yes, it does,

99
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,960
to share and access files between users on the same system.

100
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,160
But of course, with Ubuntu on the server,

101
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,420
probably not a good idea, is it?

102
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,240
No, probably not, right?

103
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,600
I mean, sure, there are some of these

104
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,340
like local multi-user systems,

105
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,440
but these days it's more like you're gonna have accounts

106
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,640
running various services,

107
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,840
or you might have untrusted folks

108
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,220
that you just don't want easy access to files

109
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,080
if one particular user gets compromised.

110
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,440
I've always paid close attention

111
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,880
to my.ssh directory and those particular folders,

112
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,280
but I've never really given much concern about it

113
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,080
because for the most part,

114
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,560
I'm just the sole user of a system,

115
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,760
and when we set up a server,

116
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,260
it's pretty much like you and I

117
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,100
and maybe one other person, maybe Alex,

118
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,840
and we are actually cooperating in that regard.

119
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,680
Yeah, that is true.

120
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,640
There are some of those systems,

121
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,960
but at the same time, I think it's often,

122
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,240
at least for our local systems,

123
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,720
often that we all end up with pseudo anyway.

124
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,560
So if I need to access things, I can.

125
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
I think it just makes it a little simpler as a default.

126
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,340
You could still go and change your permissions

127
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,180
on your home folders,

128
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,660
as long as you had the right access to do so, of course,

129
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,940
and give folks access,

130
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,640
but I think maybe the argument before from SunSense

131
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,140
was admins knew what they were doing,

132
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,900
and obviously, of course, if you wanna make a folder

133
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,480
that everyone else can't read,

134
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,840
easy to do so as a private folder within your home directory,

135
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,720
but as it becomes easier and easier

136
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,680
to just boot up a random VM in the cloud somewhere

137
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,760
on a hosting provider,

138
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,700
there's probably a lot of users

139
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,480
who have no idea about that, don't think to check,

140
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,160
and are surprised when they find out

141
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,840
that everyone can read their private journal entries.

142
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,720
Very true.

143
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,760
This sort of feels like it's a legacy of old Unix systems.

144
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,920
Yeah, I mean, basically, if you think back

145
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,840
to how Unix first started off with the whole wheel group,

146
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,600
the users group, this was basically a leftover from it.

147
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,920
I mean, the idea that users would be able to share

148
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,560
the same space and share the same home folders

149
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,800
was kind of natural.

150
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,720
Yeah, and I guess it's fair to,

151
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,480
we should point out that Ubuntu's not the only distribution

152
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,320
that does this.

153
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,720
I just didn't really think about it very much.

154
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,920
I don't really think it's gonna affect

155
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,520
any existing installs, right, Wes?

156
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,360
This isn't something they're retroactively doing.

157
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,320
Yeah, it should be pretty safe.

158
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,640
It'd basically be going forward.

159
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,480
If you've upgraded your existing user,

160
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,320
they won't go and change existing permissions.

161
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,840
It'd just be new users you create,

162
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,000
and if you do it right now,

163
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,360
that gives three development releases

164
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,520
and two interim releases before the next LTS,

165
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,240
and so if there do happen to be any kinks,

166
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,520
get those out early.

167
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,000
Yep, that was the point I was just gonna make,

168
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,720
is you do, you wanna figure these things out now.

169
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,200
This is the time to do it,

170
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,040
and I think it makes a lot of sense.

171
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,800
So there was a story that we've been waiting to talk about.

172
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,240
People have been drive-by linking me this

173
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,800
with a little bit of a twist of a knife in the side, too,

174
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,640
as they laugh at me,

175
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,240
because there was recently a pretty significant

176
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,600
performance regression in Kernel 5.10 and ButterFS,

177
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,840
and today, well, actually, I think it was two days ago.

178
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,680
Sunday.

179
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,560
Yeah, Sunday, as we were recording Linux Action News,

180
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,560
Linux 5.10.8 came out.

181
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,720
Yes, it did, and making that very important

182
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,880
is it finally addresses the ButterFS performance regression

183
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,680
that was found in the 5.10 series.

184
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,720
Yeah, I guess it took eight point releases

185
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,960
to get that fixed.

186
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,360
So is this fair?

187
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,920
Because we talk about, oh, finally,

188
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,520
so it was discovered in Christmas, around Christmas,

189
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,480
and now it is the middle of January.

190
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,280
It didn't even go one major Kernel release, right?

191
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,240
And it was during Christmas and New Year's.

192
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,800
So is it really like that big of a deal

193
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,560
that it took eight minor releases

194
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,120
of the 5.10 Kernel release to get this fixed?

195
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,000
And they're like, how many distributions

196
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,800
even shipped this Kernel, really?

197
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,280
Let alone how many users that were at any kind of scale

198
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,180
actually deployed this Kernel.

199
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,320
Probably very few.

200
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,440
And so it really was sort of, in the grand sense, I think,

201
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,000
actually tidied up pretty quickly.

202
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,800
Yeah, no, I think that's a very good point.

203
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,340
It probably didn't affect that many users.

204
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,920
And of course, you could always use a previous Kernel version

205
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,120
if you really needed to.

206
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,400
Of course, this thing is likely to happen sometimes

207
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,640
when your file system support is built into your Kernel.

208
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,600
I guess it's just a problem ZFS users don't have.

209
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,520
But the good news is that it appears

210
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,160
things will get a lot better for ButterFS in 5.11.

211
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,720
But were you clear on what the regression was, Wes?

212
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,800
Because I know that one of the ways they tested it

213
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,240
was by extracting some files on, say, an SSD,

214
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,640
like a high-speed SSD.

215
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,360
And they would see somewhere between a 5 to 20 times

216
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,040
slower performance than expected.

217
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,720
Yeah, it sounds like a while ago they

218
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,400
made a change that would sort of clean up

219
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,360
how they were deallocating stuff that was no longer in use

220
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,400
and reuse some existing infrastructure that they

221
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,160
had in place for flushing inodes or during device

222
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,520
replace and snapshot and sort of leveraging

223
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,200
existing structures within the code base to clean things up.

224
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,680
But unfortunately, that had a downside

225
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,440
of stuff taking 5 to 20 times as long to extract,

226
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,840
because they ended up flushing a lot more than they really

227
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,720
needed to.

228
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,360
And to make it more complicated, a different bug fix

229
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,480
built on this behavior.

230
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,520
And so they couldn't just revert the whole change,

231
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,360
because that had the risk of introducing some other dead

232
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,920
locks in other places.

233
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,840
So the only strategy was to just roll forward,

234
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,840
which is also maybe why this took a little bit longer

235
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,600
than it might otherwise have.

236
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,240
This also was one of those situations

237
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,800
where a lot of people piled onto this story

238
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,480
and were like, look, it's still not good enough.

239
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,520
It's still, look at this.

240
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,600
They just had a performance regression,

241
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,160
as if regressions and little issues here aren't things,

242
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,720
and as if that's not where distributions step in and kind

243
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,960
of provide a bit of guidance before they deploy it.

244
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,880
Like, just sort of forgetting the entire way software

245
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,840
actually gets deployed in the Linux ecosystem,

246
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,000
it was sort of leveraged as an opportunity

247
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,520
to make fun of ButterFS again.

248
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,080
And I struggle to really understand the logic in this.

249
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,240
Like, we're all in this together.

250
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,520
We all want a file system that's capable of things

251
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,520
like compression, encryption, snapshotting, send and receive.

252
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,840
These are just basic volume management.

253
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,280
These are things that we want in a file system

254
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,440
to be a competitive operating system,

255
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,120
and we want them built in.

256
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,120
And ButterFS is the window to that world.

257
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,640
A friend of the show recently had a conversation

258
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,400
with an Oracle executive about the possibility of ever

259
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,080
sending a ZFS upstream and relicensing it to a GPL,

260
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,720
and he was told flat out, never going to happen.

261
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,720
And this was within a week.

262
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,000
That sounds about right to me.

263
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,440
You could take my word for it or not, but it happened.

264
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,280
And it's just ZFS is in a position

265
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,000
where they like it right now, and they're not

266
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,900
going to relicense it, at least according to this one person.

267
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,320
Now, ButterFS is here.

268
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
It's functional.

269
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,040
And it also solves use cases that ZFS doesn't.

270
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,760
And I think this is the only other area

271
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,160
I just wanted to touch on, not to get on a whole ButterFS

272
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,560
thing here, but ButterFS is really great on devices

273
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,120
that ZFS isn't a particularly good option for.

274
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,760
ButterFS is fantastic on the SD card in my Raspberry Pi 4

275
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,320
or on the USB disk that I use.

276
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,200
It's fantastic on a laptop with a single SSD.

277
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:34,000
It works so great as the root file system for our arch server.

278
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,620
It saved our arse several times.

279
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,160
Because it's ButterFS, it always mounts.

280
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,400
So our system boots, even if something

281
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,360
went wrong with the kernel module for ZFS, which happens.

282
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,200
And it also means we get snapshots

283
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,280
after every major upgrade or install in our arch box

284
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,600
automatically, because we've tied in the right tools.

285
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,400
That's all just built in with ButterFS

286
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,160
and just connecting the right dots.

287
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,380
And then we can restore the module.

288
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,720
We can get things working again.

289
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,480
And we can get our ZFS pool back online.

290
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,800
But it means our server comes up.

291
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,320
And we can SSH into it.

292
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,920
And we can resolve the issue.

293
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,160
ButterFS is just undeniably better at that particular use

294
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,520
case for us.

295
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,760
If the root file system were ZFS,

296
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,000
our system wouldn't boot sometimes.

297
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,760
And we solve that and still get compression,

298
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,680
still get encryption, and still get snapshots with ButterFS.

299
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,340
Because it's built right into our kernel.

300
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,240
And it does a great job.

301
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,440
And we're not the only ones that are saying this.

302
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,280
Yeah, true.

303
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,120
I mean, I think just to your earlier point,

304
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,080
the fact that this bug was A, found

305
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,480
is a sign that folks out there are really using it.

306
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,760
And B, that it was fixed relatively quickly

307
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,180
is a sign of good, active maintainership,

308
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,560
that people are using it and that there's resources here

309
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,560
that people want to continue improving the file system.

310
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,400
And at the end of the day, after this patch set in 5.10,

311
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,800
ButterFS is significantly faster than it was in plain 5.9.

312
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,640
So OK, there's dips and valleys, and it goes up and down.

313
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,140
But at the end of the day, we just

314
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,480
keep getting a better and better net file system.

315
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,760
Right, I completely agree.

316
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,920
And it means that in future iterations,

317
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,800
we're just going to be able to build on what's coming in 5.11.

318
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,600
And yeah, I mean, you could poke a little fun

319
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,480
that it took eight minor releases.

320
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,520
But I don't know, Neil, when you consider the fact

321
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,160
that there's holidays in there, it's a pretty quick turnaround.

322
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,120
When it comes to stuff like this, it's really hard.

323
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,720
And Joseph Bastic and I talked once about this.

324
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,400
And he says, what I wouldn't give

325
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,500
for having a standardized, comprehensive storage workload

326
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,040
test, because then we could catch all the things.

327
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,560
And it came up, I think, what, five, six days

328
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,460
before Christmas?

329
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,400
Everybody was already jumping out because holidays.

330
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,200
And even with that, the turnaround time to the initial fix

331
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,720
was still less than 20 days, which is freaking impressive.

332
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,640
That is way faster than any third party

333
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,280
or commercial software vendor has ever

334
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,240
done for me in my entire life.

335
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,120
And another point here about dips and valleys

336
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,060
and whatever with ButterFS, ButterFS

337
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,880
is not the only file system that has ever

338
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,760
suffered these kinds of things.

339
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,000
XFS, for example, in the 5.9 cycle,

340
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,040
got a major data corruption bug that

341
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,240
was introduced midway through and then

342
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,440
had to be fixed after the fact.

343
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,220
It happened again with 5.10 and had to be fixed again.

344
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,080
These are things that happen, major or minor issues.

345
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,520
Data corruption stuff, thankfully,

346
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,360
doesn't happen very often with ButterFS

347
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,560
anymore in terms of new developments and code churn.

348
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,320
But because the kernel's highly integrated

349
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,560
and has a lot of subsystems, and there's a lot of people,

350
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,440
and the development workflow for the Linux kernel

351
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,880
is, in my opinion, pretty awful, it's

352
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,000
impressive how well the Linux kernel continues

353
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,800
to be developed given all of these factors.

354
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,720
So most people weren't even going

355
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,200
to experience this problem because the workload was

356
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,480
very, very specific.

357
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,400
You had to be unpacking a large tarball

358
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,160
with a lot of little files in one basically IO

359
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,760
transaction, which is what led to this particular problem.

360
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,400
And I have been bitten by ButterFS bugs way in the past.

361
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,800
But as a pretty extensive ButterFS user now,

362
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,680
I have it in several.

363
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,640
I have it on laptops.

364
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,800
I have it on pies.

365
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,840
And I have it on server metal.

366
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,320
I wasn't bit in any of those scenarios by this, thankfully.

367
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,960
So again, I don't think it was a wide deployment.

368
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,440
But speaking about the kernel development process

369
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,760
and what that's like, next week on the show,

370
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,120
the executive editor of lwn.net, Jonathan Corbett,

371
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,560
is joining me to talk a little bit about the kernel

372
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,880
development, the state of maintainers,

373
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,200
and also LWN because they have an anniversary coming up.

374
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,920
So that should be a good conversation in episode 390.

375
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,640
So stay tuned for that.

376
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,140
But yeah, I'm glad to see it fixed.

377
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,240
I'm glad to see the performance stuff coming.

378
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,280
And I just kind of feel like we're all on the same team

379
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,400
when it comes to some of these file systems.

380
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,420
And taking a shot at it when it has a bug is, I don't know,

381
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,800
something about it, just something about it.

382
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,760
It didn't sit right with me.

383
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,080
And I think it's where I think the issue is,

384
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,400
and this is my last thought on it.

385
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,760
I'm sorry, but this is just something

386
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,640
I've been reflecting on.

387
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,520
You've got a ButterFS bug in your ear.

388
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,680
Better than somewhere else, I suppose.

389
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,720
I think what you have is you have people

390
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,720
that have different use cases that are looking at a tool,

391
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,240
thinking, well, this isn't the right tool for me.

392
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,520
There's a reason why our large pool runs ZFS.

393
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,480
Because in our estimation, that was the better tool

394
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,560
for that job.

395
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,080
And it has remained that way, despite all the different

396
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,800
operating systems we've tried.

397
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,640
We've always kept ZFS on that pool, and it has served us well.

398
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,560
Yep, it's been great.

399
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,000
We wouldn't reload.

400
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,720
If we got a new brand new disk array,

401
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,400
we would do ZFS again on that.

402
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,280
That's the use case for it.

403
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,280
And I think what you have is you have people

404
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,040
who are not in the right use cases that

405
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,320
are comparing file systems.

406
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,240
And it's an apple to oranges kind of comparison

407
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,480
in that regard.

408
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,200
And it's totally fine if it doesn't work for you, right?

409
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,960
Plenty of file systems I never touch, by and large,

410
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,760
but they are really helpful for other folks, like ex-fats,

411
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,600
say, right?

412
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,000
And that's perfectly all right.

413
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,680
With Linux, we have options and a huge array of options.

414
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,960
I love that.

415
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,160
Linode.com slash unplugged.

416
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,600
Go there to get a $100, 60-day credit towards a new account,

417
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,120
and you support the show.

418
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,080
Linode is our cloud hosting provider,

419
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,720
and Wes and I were having a lot of fun last night.

420
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,320
And thank you, Linode, for the snapshot system,

421
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,200
the way it works.

422
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,120
It really just gives us peace of mind

423
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,280
because we wanted to increase the amount of RAM

424
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,720
and upgrade our Synapse server at the same time.

425
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,520
The software, the RAM, and we wanted to also do the OS.

426
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,560
And so it just was so nice because, first of all,

427
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,760
one button to make a snapshot right before you start.

428
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,280
But what they do that other cloud providers don't

429
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,640
is they give you an opportunity to label it.

430
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,840
So you label that snapshot.

431
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,120
You hit Go.

432
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,800
And then the great thing is there's a notification area

433
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,440
in the dashboard.

434
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,840
It just kind of tucks it up in the corner.

435
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,260
You don't have to see it if you don't want.

436
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,560
But if you click it, it actually gives you

437
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,840
a live progress bar of how the snapshot's going

438
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,360
with time estimation.

439
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,440
So Wes is at home.

440
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,360
I'm at the studio.

441
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,760
I can tell him, all right, we've got four minutes

442
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,720
until the snapshot's done, and then we'll do the upgrade.

443
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,000
And it just works so smooth.

444
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,600
And when we rebooted the system and realized

445
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
that we didn't know the root password anymore,

446
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,520
I was able to get on the console and get that resolved

447
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,900
and reset the root password in seconds from their dashboard

448
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,640
and get us back in and get us going.

449
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,280
And I just really appreciated the tools

450
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,240
that Linode made available to us on top of other things

451
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,680
like we have moved Linodes between data centers now,

452
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,000
and that's really cool.

453
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,840
Adding additional memory to our Linode was easy.

454
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,080
We went from 4 gigs to 16 gigs in seconds.

455
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,080
They make all of this really straightforward.

456
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,580
So you don't have to be an expert.

457
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,840
But if you are, you start to see a few things

458
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,160
that when you drill down in the UI, they're there for you

459
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,880
that you can really appreciate.

460
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,280
But what I get out of that is you

461
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,900
can tell they have a love and a passion for this technology.

462
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,480
But really, that's what got them going.

463
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,420
That's why they started in 2003 as the first company

464
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,640
in cloud computing.

465
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,400
They started three years before AWS

466
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,100
because they are Linux users, and they get it.

467
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,320
They get how to build on the technology.

468
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,440
That's what I love about a lot of the vendors

469
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,440
in our community.

470
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,640
And through the years, they've supported events like Linux

471
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,940
Fest Northwest, All Things Open, the Kubuntu Project,

472
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,960
a bunch of others.

473
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,080
Those are the ones that I have seen personally.

474
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,760
And of course, now they're making

475
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,760
it possible for Jupyter Broadcasting

476
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,560
to go independent and give our content away for free.

477
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,840
That is a massive value.

478
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,440
And I just think it's such a great combination

479
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,400
because it's a great service built by Linux users supporting

480
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,640
a Linux business.

481
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,200
And you can get a $100 60-day credit when you

482
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,320
go to linode.com slash unplug.

483
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,840
Go there, support the show, get that $100,

484
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,000
and play around with their object storage.

485
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,380
Just a quick mention, we are going

486
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,880
to be talking a little bit about how

487
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,080
you can use object storage for backups with our pick later.

488
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,800
And it works with any S3 compatible object storage,

489
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,240
which Linode has.

490
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,620
And it's so great because you get fast, reliable storage up

491
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,520
in the cloud without having to manage a server in front of it.

492
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,480
There's a lot of uses for that, including

493
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,960
backups, static websites, and many other things.

494
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,320
So get started at linode.com slash unplugged.

495
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,040
Before we get into the show much further,

496
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,640
I think this is a good moment for us

497
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,400
to take stock and do a little housekeeping.

498
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,840
And I want to start with Minimac,

499
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,200
because he has some updates for us on an upcoming Luplug

500
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,920
session.

501
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,080
Yeah, thanks, Chris.

502
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,080
So now that probably the whole world

503
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,640
knows that we will have a talk about accessibility

504
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,040
tools in Linux next Sunday on Luplug,

505
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,400
the only thing left to me is to reveal

506
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,600
the name of our special guest we have during the talk.

507
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,480
So I have the pleasure to announce

508
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,880
that Daniel Ferre, the founder of the elementary project,

509
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,040
will join us for a Luplug session.

510
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,800
So what can you expect during that talk?

511
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,320
So we will have Justin, a user of our JPMobile community,

512
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,440
and he will share his experience and workflow with assistive

513
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,760
tools in Linux.

514
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,680
And Daniel Ferre will give us an inside view

515
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,600
on how the elementary team tries to make life easier

516
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,320
for people with disabilities.

517
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,640
And maybe Daniel might also give us

518
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,200
an overview on features we can expect in the future elementary

519
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,040
6 release.

520
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,200
Oh, yeah, get some info.

521
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

522
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,600
There are some really cool things to mention there.

523
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,040
And I hope we will have a really good talk.

524
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,600
Yeah, so that'll be January 24th on Sunday

525
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,000
at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

526
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,280
And all they need is Mumble, right?

527
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
Just join the lobby.

528
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,520
Just join the lobby.

529
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,400
I hope you'll find the time next Sunday.

530
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Just join the lobby.

531
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,160
And if you want, we can do some sound checks

532
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,160
if you want to participate actively during the talk.

533
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,200
So thanks, Chris.

534
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,320
Yeah, looking forward to that.

535
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
And we do put the plugs up on the calendar, too.

536
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,960
So if you want to get in your time zone,

537
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,120
just go to jupiterbroadcasting.com.

538
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,360
Slash calendar.

539
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,640
Also, you never know what we might have next.

540
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,240
If you hear the pre-shows, we're always

541
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,320
kind of kicking around new show ideas and whatnot.

542
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,000
So get subscribed to the All Jupiter Broadcasting shows.

543
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,120
One feed, you get Coda Radio, self-hosted, Linux Action News,

544
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,160
and Linux Unplugged.

545
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,760
It's nice.

546
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,240
It's tight.

547
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,920
It's tidy.

548
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,720
And it's a bunch of great content.

549
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,760
That's the All Shows feed.

550
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,520
You can find that at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

551
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,600
And Mr. Bain, I think that's all the housekeeping

552
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,520
we have for this week.

553
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,000
It looks like everything around here is tidy.

554
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,840
It sure does.

555
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,400
Nice job.

556
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,280
So I'm going to say Ventoy.

557
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,440
You think I got it?

558
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:33,800
Oh, gosh.

559
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,000
I didn't even think to question it.

560
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,880
That's just what I've been calling it all along.

561
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,440
Oh, I question everything I pronounce on the air.

562
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,280
You probably should.

563
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,880
All the time.

564
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,920
I have a complex about it at this point.

565
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,800
So Ventoy is a new bootable USB solution.

566
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,200
It's 100% open source.

567
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,040
It's simple to use.

568
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,120
And you write it to a USB thumb drive.

569
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,640
It creates the Ventoy bootable partition.

570
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,400
And it creates a storage partition,

571
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,240
which you can kind of format as you like.

572
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,040
And then you drop ISOs, just mount it on your desktop,

573
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,360
drop ISOs in this directory on this Ventoy USB stick.

574
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,440
And they show up as bootable options

575
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,640
when you plug it into a PC and boot off of it.

576
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,840
So if you have, say, several ISOs up there,

577
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,480
a grub-looking menu comes up, and each ISO

578
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,600
is listed right there for you to choose.

579
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,960
And it just begins to boot that ISO.

580
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,600
So it's like, you no longer, you write this to your USB stick

581
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,520
once, and then from that point forward,

582
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,760
you just drop ISOs on it.

583
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,320
Yeah, aren't you tired of constantly having to reflash

584
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,320
that same USB drive when you already had Fedora on there,

585
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,400
but now you're putting Ubuntu, and suddenly you

586
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,000
want Fedora again?

587
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,920
It's annoying.

588
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,720
I actually can't tell you how useful this is for a guy like me

589
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,280
who often takes laptops home for a weekend project for the show.

590
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,360
And if I'm not careful, I get in a situation

591
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,160
where I need an ISO, and it takes forever to download

592
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,720
an ISO on my connection.

593
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,680
And I will write, right now, Wes,

594
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,480
I have two different USB thumb drives in my bag.

595
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,000
One is an Arch ISO, and one is an Ubuntu ISO, or maybe Fedora.

596
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,880
I can't remember.

597
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,400
I overwrite them from time to time.

598
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,000
So then I get home, and it's like, oh, I got the wrong one.

599
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,800
And now I'm just going to wait for two hours

600
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,360
while I download an ISO.

601
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,760
This is so much simpler, because I can just put all of them

602
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,840
here at the studio on one thumb drive

603
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,600
and just take that thumb drive with me.

604
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,560
What's also really neat is it's not just ISOs.

605
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,520
Maybe you boot into Windows sometimes,

606
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,320
or you want to have something to help around

607
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,240
with family or friends.

608
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,640
We need to install Windows, perhaps, to re-kick things.

609
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,360
If they've got plugins to boot from VHD files or even.wim

610
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,320
images, that's awesome.

611
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,640
Yeah, and we've kind of toyed around with other things

612
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,920
like this before.

613
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,640
But this is just straight up the simplest.

614
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,600
If you're on Windows, they've got an EXE process

615
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,080
to go through to write the stick.

616
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,240
But on Linux, you download a Bash script.

617
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,740
I mean, there's several ways to do it.

618
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,540
But the simple way is you download their Bash script,

619
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,720
give it a little quick look, and then you run it and just point

620
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,880
it at the thumb drive device.

621
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,360
Make sure you get that right.

622
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,040
Yes.

623
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,400
Yes, don't do dev SDA.

624
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,560
For me, it was dev SDF, because I just have a few drives.

625
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,520
And you just kick it off.

626
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,960
You just execute the shell script,

627
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,600
point, and give it the device path.

628
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,480
And in a few seconds, after it asks you,

629
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,400
are you really sure you want to wipe this thing, it's done.

630
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,320
And it's good to go.

631
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,720
You can tell that this has been a pretty battle tested tool,

632
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,880
because they have a lot of nice options.

633
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,240
So by default, it'll set things up with an MBR still, MBR style,

634
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,280
so that it supports both legacy BIOS and UEFI

635
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,280
right on the same thing.

636
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,840
But if you want to just go full future forward,

637
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,360
you can use GPT and UEFI only if you want.

638
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,040
That's what I did, because I don't have any more legacy BIOS

639
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,400
systems these days, thankfully.

640
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,560
It's nice and consistent.

641
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,640
And in the same way, they set up one sort of grub system

642
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,080
partition where all the stuff that Ventoy uses internally is.

643
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,040
And then you've also got a partition just for all

644
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,560
of your image files.

645
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,280
And by default, that's exFAT, which

646
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,920
I think is designed to be pretty universally accessible.

647
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,960
So if you're trying to boot it on some random Mac

648
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,920
or Windows PC, it'll just work.

649
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,240
And you have access to actually update and add new images

650
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,400
without having to worry about some weird Linux file

651
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,720
system on there.

652
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,360
But on the system I was using, I had an older kernel.

653
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,440
I hadn't set up the exFAT support.

654
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,040
So I just reflashed that to ext4.

655
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,320
And you can do that no problem.

656
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,760
They've got that in the docs.

657
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,400
So if you're just like me and using it on Linux systems,

658
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,480
that might be the route you try.

659
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,640
Yeah, because then you get larger ISO support.

660
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,000
And this thing supports big ISO files.

661
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,240
In fact, I think they said they tested up to 600, more than 600

662
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,120
ISOs on this thing at once.

663
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,620
Wow.

664
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,040
It must be quite the menu to scroll through.

665
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,200
Because it's all really kind of a grub menu.

666
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,680
I wonder, though, if you saw, so when you boot it up,

667
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,400
like a typical boot screen, you got your options

668
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,080
along the bottom.

669
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,560
And some of them are kind of nice.

670
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,280
You can kind of preset some video mode stuff.

671
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,000
And actually, there's some really nice things

672
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,560
that it lets you do.

673
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,240
But did you see what F1 does?

674
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,200
No, I don't think I tried F1.

675
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,960
OK, so this is right up your alley.

676
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,160
Because what F1 does is it copies the contents of ISO

677
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,280
into RAM.

678
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,000
So then you're running the live environment out of RAM.

679
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,960
Instead of using the USB ISO image,

680
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,040
it just copies all of the contents into a RAM disk

681
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,400
and then executes it from scratch.

682
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,580
Like, you get the full boot menu.

683
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,960
You get grub where you can select,

684
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,700
do you want the open source only boot?

685
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,320
Or do you want the one with proprietary drivers?

686
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,640
Like, if your distro asks you that,

687
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,840
you get all of that still.

688
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,360
But just all of the contents of that ISO image

689
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,680
are coming from a RAM disk.

690
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,000
Wow, yeah, it's so cool.

691
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,440
And there's all kinds of other plug-ins

692
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,760
if you want to customize things like add your own theme,

693
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,240
customize how the menu system works.

694
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,680
It's just really well-developed.

695
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,720
Yeah, I'll have to just keep this now as one of my tools.

696
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,680
I used to have, forever ago, a Zantec.

697
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,520
I actually still have it, a Zantec USB 3.0 hard disk

698
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,040
with USB-A plug.

699
00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:00,680
And inside, I put it in a 128 gigabyte, 2 and 1 half inch SSD.

700
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,960
And what it does is it uses a CD-ROM emulation, the USB CD-ROM

701
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,480
emulation.

702
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,200
So when I plug it into a device, it actually shows up as a CD-ROM

703
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,920
and it uses the ISOs that are on that 128 gigabyte SSD

704
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,160
as the CD-ROM contents.

705
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,400
And that's pretty neat, but it's got this tiny little janky

706
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,140
80s style LCD screen that I have to scroll

707
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,520
through all the ISOs and select.

708
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,880
And it's this weird process where you plug it in

709
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,840
and you need power from the bus to select the ISO,

710
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,000
but you want to select the ISO before the system fully posts.

711
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,800
So you either race into it really fast

712
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,040
or you power it up, select the ISO, and then do a soft reboot.

713
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,920
You have to do this whole weird dance with it.

714
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,200
Where this is just you tell the system

715
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,280
to boot off the USB stick, choose your ISO,

716
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,000
and then it's like you had a USB stick that only had

717
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,760
that distribution's image on it.

718
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,080
It's just great.

719
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,440
It's a lot of fun and makes it so much easier to distro hop.

720
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,920
Or just have the different distros

721
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,560
I might need easily available so I

722
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,400
don't have to re-download them like an animal.

723
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,640
It is interesting that some folks in IRC

724
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,880
are commenting they've had problems on older hardware

725
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,400
or even some reports here from Rolf on Skylake laptops.

726
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,720
So far in my testing, and I tried it on pretty much every

727
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,920
system I've got in my house, no problems,

728
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,100
but you do be aware that maybe it won't work everywhere.

729
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,520
But I like the idea of just having this as default.

730
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,120
And OK, I've got extra USB drives if for some reason

731
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,040
it just doesn't work on some machine.

732
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,640
Yep, and like Wes said, it does have UEFI support,

733
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,960
but it also has ARM64 UEFI support.

734
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,360
So if you've got an ARM64.

735
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,320
Fancy.

736
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,360
I know.

737
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,320
I know, Wes.

738
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,160
I know that.

739
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,560
And it has a plug-in framework, which

740
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,040
it did not play around with.

741
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,320
So I guess in theory, you could really

742
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,800
kind of customize this thing quite a bit.

743
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,080
Maybe you're an IT shop.

744
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,440
Yeah, you could imagine having a sort of standard Vento setup

745
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,080
you just give to all of your techs.

746
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,880
They've got it in their bag.

747
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,160
They can boot up to whatever, you know, emergency CDs.

748
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,000
There's even a Vento Live ISO they've

749
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,160
got if you don't have it already set up and just need

750
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,720
an environment to get it installed.

751
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,220
And the thing that's nice too is they

752
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,560
do make it kind of straightforward for Windows

753
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,080
users to get going with this.

754
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,040
That's not something we talk a lot about, but it does matter.

755
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,700
So much easier, right?

756
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,400
Especially if you're just flirting around playing

757
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:06,880
with Linux.

758
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,080
I mean, here I am using ddrescue in the shell like an animal,

759
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,000
but that's just not very accessible.

760
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,080
Whereas dragging and dropping an ISO file and then rebooting,

761
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,840
that is.

762
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,440
Yeah, and I wonder, like, what are the must-have ISOs you'd

763
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,560
put on something like this?

764
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,360
System rescue CD seems like a pretty solid ISO

765
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,860
to always have on there, regardless,

766
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,360
just in case all of a sudden you need it.

767
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,080
Yeah, definitely.

768
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,520
Or Clonezilla, similar things.

769
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,500
Yeah, yeah, Veritunis is Clonezilla.

770
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,340
That's a good one.

771
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,280
Yeah, that is good.

772
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,320
Good point.

773
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,360
I think too, like, this might actually push me over the edge

774
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,840
to finally get a USB-C thumb drive,

775
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,320
because I'm kind of getting sick and tired of using

776
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,960
adapters and whatnot.

777
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,440
Mm-hmm, yes.

778
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,720
And maybe I'll get like a kind of a higher speed one

779
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,240
if I can.

780
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,120
And 128 gigs would probably be plenty.

781
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,960
I never even, when I had my Zalman, whatever it was,

782
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,960
thing, I never exceeded the 128 gigs.

783
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,320
Because by the time you're using that much space,

784
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,280
the Linux ISOs on there are so old,

785
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,500
they're not really relevant anymore.

786
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,840
You just kind of cycle them out.

787
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,680
So you don't need a ton of space unless you're a maniac.

788
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,400
Tails, PyCrash points out, Tails.

789
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,280
Cassidy in the chat room says, dban.

790
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,160
Yeah, yeah, that, yes, yes, yes, yes.

791
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,880
I once had a situation where I couldn't

792
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,600
get to dban quick enough.

793
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,280
So it was kind of like a, I was working

794
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,880
at this place that was called Dream Dinners.

795
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,280
And they specialized in this online ordering process, which

796
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,780
was brand new back then.

797
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,080
And they specialized in this online ordering process

798
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,560
where you would put together your dinners,

799
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,020
and then you'd go into one of their affiliate kitchens, which

800
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,120
were kind of just all over the place, all over the country.

801
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,520
And you would go in, and you would actually

802
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,360
assemble everything into bags and stuff,

803
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,200
and then take it home and freeze it.

804
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,960
It was kind of nice because they did all the thinking for you,

805
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,620
and they did all the ingredient selection.

806
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,240
But then you could add, if you like a little bit extra garlic,

807
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,480
you'd add a little bit extra garlic.

808
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,560
But they've got it all chopped up, prepared, or precooked,

809
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,480
or whatever needed to happen for those ingredients.

810
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,120
Yeah.

811
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,440
And the instructions you put in there.

812
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,480
And of course, they've got a professional chef or two

813
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,940
in there that answer your questions.

814
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,600
And everything's chilled and clean and all that.

815
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,720
But of course, what people really wanted was they

816
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,160
wanted meals delivered all the way to them.

817
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,080
And they were just one step removed from that.

818
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,000
You had to go to their franchises.

819
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,160
But to power all of this, it's kind of funny.

820
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,320
This is our LDAP episode.

821
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,280
Because to power all of this was a Red Hat Enterprise Linux

822
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,080
setup with LDAP that powered the user logins,

823
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,520
that powered the desktop logins through Samba,

824
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,320
that powered the website back end to manage it all.

825
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:44,160
It was all done with a single sign-on system that used LDAP.

826
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,440
And we would kind of monitor this system.

827
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,920
And I would kind of run it.

828
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,080
And I was a server guy.

829
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,400
And I had an IT help desk guy.

830
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,320
And it was basically me and him and a developer,

831
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,720
and then eventually two developers.

832
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,680
And that was the entire team.

833
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,440
And this infrastructure ran really great.

834
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,640
I was very proud of it.

835
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,720
Because it was, I guess, what we would now call hybrid.

836
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,200
But we didn't call hybrid back then.

837
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,480
But it was a good chunk of on-premises infrastructure,

838
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,080
but then supplemented with cloud infrastructure

839
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,920
for our front-end web server and database and stuff.

840
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,960
And that was just how I ran it.

841
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,120
And this efficiency group was hired

842
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,680
to come in and make recommendations.

843
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,400
And they came in and they analyzed everything.

844
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,640
And they said, first thing you've got to do

845
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,160
is you've got to switch to ASP.

846
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,640
You've got to drop this PHP stuff.

847
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,920
This is some open source garbage that isn't going anywhere.

848
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,120
You've got to get rid of this.

849
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,520
You need ASP, Active Server Pages.

850
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,280
And you need to run it on IIS.

851
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,920
This back then was probably Server 2003.

852
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,440
And you need to switch to Exchange and Active Directory.

853
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,400
And you need to fire your IT director, which wasn't me.

854
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,900
But they were a friend of the owner.

855
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,440
So instead of firing her, they just transitioned her.

856
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,400
And they brought in this new guy who

857
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,560
was recommended by the company and had worked for Boeing.

858
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,320
And he had just kind of started decimating

859
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,400
the entire infrastructure.

860
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,720
And he and I never really quite got along.

861
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,480
It was one of those things where I'd get in at 637 AM

862
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,440
to make sure everything was working when

863
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,600
the business started.

864
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,400
And then I'd maybe head out at 4 o'clock.

865
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,640
And I was passing him in the stairs.

866
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,800
And he looks over to me and goes,

867
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,320
I can tell who's dedicated by the cars that

868
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,440
are in the parking lot at the end of the day.

869
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,920
Your car usually isn't there.

870
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
I'll remember that.

871
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,600
And that's one of the first ways I met him.

872
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,640
And screw him, right?

873
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,360
Because I was actually getting up, commuting down there.

874
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,920
And from Smokey Point, it was a good drive.

875
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,340
Getting down there, and I was making

876
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,820
sure all the systems worked.

877
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,760
And my IT guy, Josh, he and I worked together.

878
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,120
He was there to make sure everybody

879
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,400
got a smooth start in the office.

880
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,520
So the office was there to support

881
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,160
the rest of the infrastructure.

882
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,080
We really went the extra step.

883
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,280
And so when he wanted to remove all of the Linux,

884
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,480
I was just kind of done at that point.

885
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,760
That's when I actually decided I was no longer working

886
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,740
in corporate America, and I was just

887
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,440
going to do independent IT contracting.

888
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,680
That's actually what kicked off my IT contracting career.

889
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,640
So this is about a dozen years ago.

890
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,060
As one of the hiring conditions, when I started that job,

891
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,040
I wanted a System76 laptop.

892
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,160
And so I used the hell out of that laptop.

893
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,220
I ran that entire infrastructure from that System76 laptop,

894
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,080
which made me one of their very early customers, too.

895
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:18,520
And when I was kind of coming to the realization I was leaving,

896
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,120
I went in, talked to the boss about it.

897
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,240
Said, I think I'm going to move on,

898
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,480
but I want to give you guys a good transition.

899
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,080
He's like, oh, OK, well, all right.

900
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,740
Well, why don't you go to lunch, think about it,

901
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,520
and come back, and we'll talk.

902
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,160
All right, well, there's fish and chips place next door,

903
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,800
so I was happy to go get lunch.

904
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,480
So I'm eating my fish and chips like an idiot

905
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,720
when I should have been downloading DBAN.

906
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
But instead, I get back from my lunch,

907
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,440
I sit down on my laptop, and I literally think to myself,

908
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,940
you know, I wonder if he's just going to can my ass.

909
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,120
I better get ready just in case.

910
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,320
And I'm not joking, I launch my web browser

911
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,820
when he comes up to my desk and says,

912
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,800
I'd like you to come into my office.

913
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,440
He fires me on the spot and then doesn't let

914
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,560
me ever go back to my desk.

915
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,220
He goes and boxes my stuff up and takes my laptop,

916
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,320
which was logged in, had my web browser up.

917
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,480
I don't know if the screen had locked or not,

918
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,960
because I didn't see it.

919
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,160
And that was the moment where I was like,

920
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,760
I regret not having DBAN in my bag ready to go,

921
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,960
because I could have popped DBAN in and walked away,

922
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,560
and gone into his office and just let it wipe.

923
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,680
Because if you're not familiar, DBAN audience

924
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,600
is the tool to do like an intelligence agency

925
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,040
grade wipe of your disk.

926
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,220
And I did have, I was talking, I was not happy with him.

927
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,040
So I had emails on there and stuff like that

928
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,600
that were critical of him.

929
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,400
And I didn't want him having that and keeping that.

930
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,760
And some of them were private conversations too in Pidgin.

931
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,640
They weren't like stuff I wanted him to see.

932
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,760
Yeah, so it was a real shame that I couldn't wipe it.

933
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,180
And so having a tool like Ventoy is kind of powerful,

934
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,680
because it means that I could always

935
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,480
have a thumb drive on me that has DBAN on it.

936
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
Just right in literally your back pocket.

937
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,440
Always ready to go.

938
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,400
And so I mean, these tools like this

939
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,240
are kind of important for that regard.

940
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,080
You can boot and nuke.

941
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,400
Yeah, good old boot and nuke.

942
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
But man, that guy was such a turd.

943
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,520
And then they went out of business, not shortly after that.

944
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,320
Oh, I wonder why.

945
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,120
Yeah, but it was something.

946
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,620
It was one of my better infrastructures.

947
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,280
I wouldn't say it was my best, because I

948
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,040
think I went on to build my best when I was a contractor.

949
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,040
But it was up there.

950
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,040
I was really proud of it.

951
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,800
And that single sign on stuff through LDAP and Samba

952
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,360
worked really good.

953
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,440
Windows desktops, Linux machines, website logins,

954
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,440
all of it was great.

955
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,200
It's so nice when things click like that.

956
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,060
And it just works.

957
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:31,720
It's reliable.

958
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,280
You feel like the system's actually doing what you need,

959
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,700
and you're serving the business.

960
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,000
And that's the whole goal.

961
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,500
Now I have literally no idea how I would set any of that up.

962
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,960
It's funny, right, that I used to build that and support it.

963
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,520
But today, I'd probably start picking it back up.

964
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,320
But I couldn't tell you right now how I would

965
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,560
set a system up like that.

966
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:48,960
Oh, it's fine.

967
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,600
It's just a couple of clicks in the cloud.

968
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,440
Ha ha ha.

969
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,880
Oh dear, ohdear.app.

970
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,300
Complete website monitoring from multiple locations

971
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,720
with broken link and mixed content detection

972
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,640
and advanced SSL certificate reporting and a lot more.

973
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,320
Visit ohdear.app and use promo code Linux for a $10 discount

974
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,000
on any plan.

975
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,040
But you can sign up with no credit card required.

976
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,200
So it's when you go to subscribe,

977
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,000
use the promo code Linux.

978
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,760
This is really a tool I could have used a lot back in the day

979
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,920
when I was running infrastructure,

980
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,420
because I want to be the first to know when something isn't

981
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,440
available, not the customer or not even my customer

982
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,920
at the time, which would, of course, be the end users.

983
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,880
Ohdear has global uptime checking

984
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,120
of servers worldwide that report on problems

985
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,720
as soon as they happen.

986
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,320
But the nice thing is you can go deep into the site, too.

987
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,400
They can crawl and index your entire website.

988
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,440
They can detect broken links, which, of course,

989
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,440
can hurt your SEO, but also just don't look good.

990
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,880
And they can probably notify you.

991
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,120
They have a really intelligent scheme around that.

992
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,120
You can also monitor things like your cron jobs

993
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,780
or your window schedule tasks to make sure

994
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,820
that they actually triggered and fired off

995
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,400
like they should have, because that also

996
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,760
can lead to other problems.

997
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,320
And ohdear is always monitoring for performance.

998
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,200
You get the idea of the speed of your website

999
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,520
right now and over time, so you can kind of

1000
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,120
see if there's a trend happening.

1001
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,960
But what makes ohdear very special is their API.

1002
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,040
It lets you configure everything about the application.

1003
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,440
Everything you see in your dashboard

1004
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,320
can be controlled with their easy-to-use RESTful API.

1005
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,000
It's got kick-ass documentation.

1006
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,800
And as a bonus, all the changes you make via the API

1007
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,760
will be visible in real time on your dashboard.

1008
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,480
ohdear is monitoring, and it's a solution

1009
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,160
that embraces automation.

1010
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,320
So if you're looking at monitoring solutions right now

1011
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,360
and you're thinking, I'd really like something

1012
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,720
that we can integrate, that we can automate,

1013
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,400
that we can deploy as code, you need to check out ohdear.app.

1014
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:43,960
It's ohdear.

1015
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,120
It's a comprehensive API.

1016
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,320
It means third-party integrations are simple.

1017
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,240
It's really easy to get going with command line

1018
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,340
clients, Telegram chatbots, SDKs, Terraform providers,

1019
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,320
and a lot more.

1020
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,920
So right now, head to ohdear.app and start a 10-day,

1021
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,920
no-strings-attached trial, no-credit-card required.

1022
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,440
You can get set in less than minutes.

1023
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,980
And when you do sign up for any plan,

1024
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,320
use the promo code LINUX for a $10 discount.

1025
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,440
And if they ask, tell them Linux Unplugged sent you.

1026
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,240
ohdear.app.

1027
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,040
Check them out and use promo code LINUX when you do sign up.

1028
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,640
We got a nice batch of feedback.

1029
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,680
How about I take the first one, and then you

1030
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,480
take the next one?

1031
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,880
We just kind of do it like that.

1032
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,200
Sounds good to me.

1033
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,920
Martin writes in about OpenSUSE and FOSS Adventures.

1034
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,720
He says, dear Chris and Wes, I'd like

1035
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,080
to give you some feedback on your OpenSUSE feedback.

1036
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,960
I'm a longtime JB fan since 2010.

1037
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,280
Wow.

1038
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,160
That has been a while.

1039
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,600
Oh, gee.

1040
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,240
That's great.

1041
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,040
And he says, he uses OpenSUSE.

1042
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,080
I remember when you and Brian were quite positive of OpenSUSE.

1043
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,680
Yeah, but I'm not, was Brian just positive

1044
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,800
because it got a job later?

1045
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,560
I'm not, I don't know.

1046
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,040
But he says, when you guys talked about Tumbleweed,

1047
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,360
it was quite negative.

1048
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,920
But Chris, those are your experiences.

1049
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,240
And I think you should be able to voice that.

1050
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,840
But I've run OpenSUSE for 10 years, and I love Yast.

1051
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,320
I appreciate how Yast works.

1052
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,600
It enables my mom to install her HP printer without my help,

1053
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,160
who is a total Linux novice.

1054
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,360
It's hard to argue with that, right?

1055
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,240
That's one less call for tech support.

1056
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,960
But what I don't get from that is,

1057
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,960
is Yast great for him anymore?

1058
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,640
And is that because he's only used Yast,

1059
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,040
so he has to keep using Yast?

1060
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,080
So Martin, I wouldn't mind a follow-up on that.

1061
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,080
But he says, your comments about OpenSUSE documentation,

1062
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,000
about the voice and tone and the community,

1063
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,560
and about the NVIDIA proprietary drivers,

1064
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,920
they were 100% on the mark.

1065
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,760
I experienced those pains too.

1066
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,240
He goes on to say, that's why I have my blog, Foss Adventures,

1067
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,720
to help improve the communication around OpenSUSE.

1068
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,000
I try to show others how to solve common problems

1069
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
in OpenSUSE.

1070
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,640
So that's great.

1071
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,260
I also love the blog of Cubicle Nate and another open source

1072
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:53,760
user.

1073
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,080
Check out cubiclenate.com.

1074
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,400
So his website is Foss Adventures,

1075
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,080
and then Cubicle Nate has a website at cubiclenate.com.

1076
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,520
He says, keep up the great work.

1077
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,080
Best regards, Martin.

1078
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,640
Super solid feedback, Martin, and that's a great way to,

1079
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,200
I mean, that's a great example of how to communicate,

1080
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,720
hey, I heard what you said about that distro.

1081
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,480
I heard that it doesn't work for you.

1082
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,760
Well, that's fine.

1083
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,920
Here's why it works for me.

1084
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,080
And it's just a real nice, like, I got real value.

1085
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,440
I know exactly why he asked works for his mom.

1086
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,800
That totally makes sense.

1087
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,960
And then he acknowledges that the documentation

1088
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,360
and the process around the NVIDIA driver is horrible.

1089
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,480
And I think that's such a great way

1090
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,320
to engage with somebody who tried a distro,

1091
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,440
but maybe had a slightly negative feedback,

1092
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,800
some kind of negative experience in that trying process.

1093
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,840
And honestly, if this was the experience

1094
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,160
that I had primarily received, I don't

1095
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,740
think we would have even mentioned

1096
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,780
the tone and the feedback.

1097
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,400
I don't think that would have even come up.

1098
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:49,900
Right.

1099
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,320
But here, we're not arguing.

1100
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,680
We're just sharing experiences.

1101
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,360
And we can all learn from that.

1102
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,960
Now, I like this next one because it's about Neon.

1103
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:03,320
And Plasma 5.21 looks like a barn burner of a good release.

1104
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,080
Excited already.

1105
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,860
We just kind of did a rundown in Linux Action News,

1106
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,320
if you're not familiar with coming in 5.21.

1107
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,960
But yeah.

1108
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,880
So Nacho writes in.

1109
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,640
Wes, take it.

1110
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,960
Hey, Chris and team.

1111
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,720
I'm just writing to describe my recent experience with KDE

1112
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,520
Plasma through KDE Neon.

1113
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,880
I heard your predictions episode and all the great things

1114
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,960
KDE is bringing and thought I'd give it a try.

1115
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,960
I had a 2018 15-inch HP Envy laptop that never fully worked

1116
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,280
when I installed Ubuntu proper, Ubuntu Mate, Zubuntu,

1117
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,560
and lastly, Deepin.

1118
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,840
Well, yeah, really tried those things.

1119
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,600
It always had some glitches that I'd

1120
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,240
have to put up with when running off

1121
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,200
of one of those other distributions.

1122
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,720
But KDE Neon worked great.

1123
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,960
And I was surprised at how beautiful it all looked stock.

1124
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,880
It was a bit rough trying to install the distro in high DPI.

1125
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,920
But thankfully, I'm not new to distro hopping.

1126
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,600
But once installed, I was pleasantly surprised

1127
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,440
and can see why so many people champion

1128
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,480
Plasma as their desktop of choice.

1129
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,520
Also, shout out to Alan's ThinkPad corner

1130
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,640
on Ubuntu podcast.

1131
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,920
You can pry it from my cold dead hands.

1132
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,480
I'm right there with you.

1133
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,160
Thanks again, longtime listener, Nacho.

1134
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,600
So Nacho, I'm curious if you had,

1135
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,240
you mentioned that you tried a few distros there.

1136
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,200
But what you didn't mention was Kubuntu.

1137
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,720
And the reason why I ask is because you

1138
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,160
say Ubuntu gave you issues.

1139
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,600
You mentioned that Mate, Zubuntu, and Deepin all had problems.

1140
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,760
But I'm surprised that Neon works for you

1141
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,920
because Neon's based on Ubuntu, right?

1142
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,800
It's just Ubuntu with the Plasma desktop.

1143
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,360
Fancy your newer Plasma.

1144
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,300
Yeah, yeah, it's 2004 with newer Plasma.

1145
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,760
So I wonder if Kubuntu, now that you've got something working,

1146
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,840
it doesn't really matter.

1147
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,920
But just for troubleshooting, I'm just

1148
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,880
curious to know what was going on there.

1149
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,600
But good to know.

1150
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,440
And I agree, KD Neon's going to look even more attractive here

1151
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,520
in about mid-February when Plasma 5.21 lands.

1152
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,040
I'm going to be updating the day it comes out.

1153
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,440
So Matthew writes in.

1154
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,000
He says, my request is simple.

1155
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,160
I really miss Chris's next Tuesday in the outro.

1156
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,920
It always makes me smile and look forward

1157
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,720
to the next episode.

1158
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,600
Can we please bring that back?

1159
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,080
Smiles are in short supply this day.

1160
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,440
I will try.

1161
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,060
I kind of stopped doing it because I just

1162
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,280
figure after a while, a gimmick like that

1163
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,360
gets annoying if people listen and listen.

1164
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,000
But if the people want more Tuesday, Wes.

1165
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,280
You have no right to deny these folks.

1166
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,000
Yeah, I'll tell them to see you next Tuesday all day long

1167
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,040
if that's what they want.

1168
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,560
Do you want to take listener Chris's email?

1169
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,560
Yeah, I better because otherwise if you read it,

1170
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,800
it's just too confusing based on the name.

1171
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,560
Hello, Chris, Wes, and the JB family.

1172
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,920
Wanted to share an upcoming product release from Lenovo.

1173
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,920
And Chris links us over to the ThinkPad X12 Detachable 12-inch

1174
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,040
Intel-powered tablet.

1175
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,520
Interesting.

1176
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,960
Continues on, what do you think of the prospects of Linux

1177
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,160
running on Lenovo's?

1178
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,360
Answer to the Microsoft Surface Pro.

1179
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,080
I've been desirous for years of an all-in-one Linux device

1180
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,960
that serves as both my laptop and tablet when needed.

1181
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,800
And given that I occasionally run a few VMs and containers

1182
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,440
that require x86 hardware, something in the ARM world

1183
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,040
just wouldn't work for me.

1184
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,120
Thanks for the awesome shows and all that you do.

1185
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,400
Life wouldn't be the same without my JB Linux fix.

1186
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,640
And I'm curious to hear if you guys would be interested

1187
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,240
in something like this.

1188
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:33,360
So this guy is a 12.3-inch detachable tablet-style laptop.

1189
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,880
It does come with a little pen that kind of snaps

1190
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,200
onto the side of the keyboard.

1191
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,520
And it looks pretty lightweight.

1192
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,560
It looks like it's probably significantly lighter

1193
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,480
than any laptop I've ever had.

1194
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,000
And it has also a kick-out stand.

1195
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,120
So if you do take the screen mobile,

1196
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,640
it does kind of have that Surface-style stand

1197
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,840
that snaps out.

1198
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,720
Well, it looks like it might even have Intel Xe graphics.

1199
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,280
So that's interesting.

1200
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,920
Up to 16 gigs of RAM, you can get an i7 in there

1201
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,040
or a 1-terabyte NVMe SSD.

1202
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,920
So it's not a slouch of a system.

1203
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,200
Yeah, that makes sense, right?

1204
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,880
It makes sense it would have 11th Gen.

1205
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,920
That's nice.

1206
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,320
It's a 1920 by 1280 IPS anti-reflective,

1207
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:14,160
anti-smudge, 400 nits Gorilla Glass screen.

1208
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,560
Looks like it just has 16 gigs of RAM and a terabyte NVMe.

1209
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,880
It may not even be customizable in that regard.

1210
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,720
You know, it's funny.

1211
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,600
If you would ask me six months ago, I'd be like, nah, nah.

1212
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:30,280
But there might be a place for this in my life.

1213
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,440
I am starting to realize that, and I apologize

1214
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,200
that I'm making somewhat kind of a car analogy,

1215
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,320
but there's a lot of different laptops for different people.

1216
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,880
And you've got your commuter laptops.

1217
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,520
You've got your truck laptops.

1218
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,160
You've got your sports car laptops.

1219
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,600
Is this just you trying to explain

1220
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,040
why you have so many computers?

1221
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,880
I'm buried in laptops at the moment.

1222
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,280
Thankfully, only a couple of them are actually owned by me.

1223
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,920
But I'll tell you what, having a bunch of different laptops

1224
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,480
at one time, it's like never something

1225
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,280
I would have just done, right?

1226
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,840
I wouldn't just all of a sudden have a bunch of laptops,

1227
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,000
because what's the point?

1228
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,880
You don't need that many laptops at one time.

1229
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,600
But because there have been a bunch in and out for review,

1230
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,560
I've got ThinkPads.

1231
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,420
I've got Lenovo's.

1232
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,400
I've got Asus'.

1233
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,240
There's a MacBook.

1234
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,040
Like, the whole gamut for, because we're

1235
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,080
doing them on code or two.

1236
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,600
It's like the whole thing, right?

1237
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,680
And that's really been an interesting perspective,

1238
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,520
because it's like, well, which one

1239
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,680
do I want to drive right now?

1240
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,920
I think I'm going to take this one, because I'm

1241
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,560
doing this kind of job.

1242
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,240
And I could see if I was rich, like Jay Leno,

1243
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,240
instead of having a garage full of cars,

1244
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,400
I'd have garages full of different kinds of computers

1245
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,600
and laptops and stuff.

1246
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,960
And I could see a place for this,

1247
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,200
because I really like having a tablet when

1248
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,760
I am sitting on the couch next to a family member

1249
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,040
and we're looking something up.

1250
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,680
Or I'm entertaining myself while the kids are

1251
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,360
watching some video on the TV.

1252
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,680
I like having the flexibility of that.

1253
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,040
But they're so limited.

1254
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,040
Anytime I want to do anything, like if I want,

1255
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,000
I need to go log into my bank account and figure something

1256
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,240
out.

1257
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,360
Anytime I want to do any serious work, I put the tablet down,

1258
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,160
and I go dig out the laptop.

1259
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,560
But if this, it'd just be a matter of snapping it

1260
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,000
into a base.

1261
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,640
Obviously, there'd be UI and desktop environment issues

1262
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,360
to work out, which I guess in the real, I guess,

1263
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,760
so I guess, Wes, you'd have to look at this in the real world.

1264
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,660
That may be a disincentive.

1265
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,840
It's getting better.

1266
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,240
But it's not like there's a perfect UI for this right now.

1267
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,280
That was kind of my main question is,

1268
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,120
what would a real Linux experience

1269
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,640
be with a modern Linux desktop?

1270
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,040
Like, I'm not sure we've optimized

1271
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,960
that well for this case.

1272
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,400
I don't know.

1273
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,440
I don't have any device that's really like this.

1274
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,560
So I've not tried it personally.

1275
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,120
So at this point, I think picking one up

1276
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,920
would probably be on the experimental end.

1277
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,260
But that's the first step to figuring something out

1278
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:39,120
that works nicely.

1279
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,400
And if Lenovo seems more and more friendly to Linux,

1280
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,120
maybe it means the hardware will just work,

1281
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,380
and we need to just work on the presentation layer.

1282
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,000
If Lenovo was smart, I mean, who am I to say?

1283
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,240
But it seems like they would be kind of interested in what

1284
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,800
it's like to run Linux on there, because otherwise, they're

1285
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,480
competing against Microsoft's own hardware, which, hmm,

1286
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,040
you know, the Surface is pretty well known and pretty popular.

1287
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,920
And if you're kind of into this form factor,

1288
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,520
you're probably pretty inclined to go get the Surface.

1289
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,640
And there's been news recently that there

1290
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,980
are several performance improvements

1291
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:15,480
and other kinds of improvements for the Surface landing

1292
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,800
upstream in the Linux kernel right now.

1293
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,040
It seems like it's a popular product.

1294
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,120
Yeah, oh, hey, OK.

1295
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,680
So we might have more than a few options pretty soon.

1296
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,840
Yeah, so we'll see.

1297
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,560
All right, so I'll take this last one,

1298
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,960
because it's totally on me.

1299
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,000
Hang writes, and he says, I noticed.

1300
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,520
I noticed that Google Forms were being used for the Tuxes.

1301
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,100
Therefore, I did not fill it out.

1302
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,560
I was astonished to see that members of an open source

1303
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:45,000
community use proprietary and spyware tools,

1304
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,560
such as Google Forms, to conduct surveys.

1305
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,260
Have you considered using an open source survey software

1306
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:52,320
rather than closed source proprietary ones

1307
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,240
by a data mining company?

1308
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,520
What do you think of Cosmo Communicator, Gemini PDA,

1309
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,160
and AstroSlide Projects?

1310
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,600
There you go.

1311
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,800
What, he says, what do you think?

1312
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,000
Well, he's right, Hang.

1313
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,200
I'm sorry that we used Google Forms.

1314
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,680
It was totally a proof of concept.

1315
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,400
Here's the idea.

1316
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,560
Oh, my gosh, this is a cool idea.

1317
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,800
How do we implement it right now,

1318
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,120
because we want to talk about it and get it out there?

1319
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,040
And how do we implement it in a way where,

1320
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,400
once we've all of a sudden decided

1321
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,640
to create this extra work for the team,

1322
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,240
we can consume the information that the audience in the form

1323
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,320
of several hundred submissions will be

1324
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,960
palatable and processable by us?

1325
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,520
And that's where, when it was like kind of a day

1326
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,160
before final go, no go decision, we were like, oh, right.

1327
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,080
Well, we know that if we use Google Forms,

1328
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,600
we can get it in a spreadsheet that we

1329
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,520
can share amongst each other, and then we

1330
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,860
can massage the data, which is very much what we did.

1331
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:50,640
And that was really what drove the decision

1332
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,500
to use Google Forms.

1333
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,480
I don't love it.

1334
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,020
And I think what I want to do is just kind of be

1335
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,360
a little more intentional, as the end of the year

1336
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,920
begins to approach, to just start working on this.

1337
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,720
We've got emails from a lot of folks that want to help us.

1338
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,260
And I think that's probably when we're

1339
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,440
going to rally the troops.

1340
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,640
Yes, which we're very grateful for, by the way.

1341
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,520
Super grateful.

1342
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,880
It's really nice, because I want to do it right.

1343
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,440
And now that I know it's worth the time.

1344
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,000
Yeah, maybe we called this last year a tuxes beta.

1345
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,760
Yeah, because I thought it would be just something we'd do it,

1346
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,800
we would enjoy it.

1347
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,600
It'd be a way for us to spread a little joy,

1348
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,800
and then it'd be done.

1349
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,320
But we got contacted by several projects.

1350
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,880
We had lots of people write in and say, oh, I

1351
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,260
didn't get to vote.

1352
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:35,080
We had people that wanted to kind of have a robust debate

1353
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,160
about which winner we had chosen.

1354
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,240
There was a lot of people that kind of got engaged.

1355
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,280
And so that's great.

1356
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,080
That showed us that it was worth the effort.

1357
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,880
I actually thought it was going to be a flop.

1358
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,380
It was a misread on my part.

1359
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,760
And so the Google Forms was a way for us to try it

1360
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,080
without standing up something, without really having

1361
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,640
to go in deep on something.

1362
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,000
But my goals are now to have a dedicated website

1363
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,960
in the future, to let you guys know about a week

1364
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,920
earlier when the submissions are open,

1365
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,480
and to not use Google Forms.

1366
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,000
We'll see if we check all those boxes.

1367
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,880
All right, well, if you want to get an email in,

1368
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,040
go over to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1369
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:13,000
Wes, why don't we wrap it up with the System76 prediction

1370
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,240
before we get out of here.

1371
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,400
Kevin writes in with his System76 prediction.

1372
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,360
My 2020 prediction.

1373
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,520
All right, it's a little late.

1374
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,160
But what we're going to allow this one

1375
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:25,960
is that System76 will unveil an in-house designed laptop

1376
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,400
in 2021.

1377
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,860
Yeah, he's saying that that's what's going to happen in 2021.

1378
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:33,640
I thought this was a fun one since social happiness, AKA Emma,

1379
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,120
is in the chat room right now.

1380
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,920
I thought it'd be fun.

1381
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,120
I'd love to see it.

1382
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,600
I think you don't get to laptop without getting to keyboard,

1383
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,320
Kevin.

1384
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,600
So I think your prediction might be a little ambitious

1385
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,240
because I think what we first need to see

1386
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,920
is a keyboard that shifts.

1387
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,960
And that is such an opportunity to learn

1388
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,360
so many lessons about the manufacturing process.

1389
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,080
But also, you want a laptop to have a killer keyboard, too.

1390
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,320
So you learn about making that component as well.

1391
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,400
Plus, you know System76 has a high bar for quality.

1392
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,120
So they're not going to push something out

1393
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,120
until it's ready.

1394
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,000
So that's just why maybe the timeline is going

1395
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,520
to be a little longer than we hope.

1396
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,280
But I would love to see it just whenever it's possible.

1397
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,120
And also, I would buy the hell out of a System76 keyboard.

1398
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,000
And I think a lot of people would because you

1399
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,040
know they'd do it right.

1400
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,440
And then that helps fund the laptop.

1401
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,600
I mean, I'm not going on any information.

1402
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,540
But it seems like a pretty practical and logical approach

1403
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,760
that's likely got a shot.

1404
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,960
So I suspect that's it, Kevin.

1405
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,360
So maybe 2022.

1406
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,040
I don't know.

1407
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:32,960
I mean, you never know.

1408
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,640
Maybe.

1409
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,140
Maybe.

1410
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:34,980
But I like it.

1411
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,480
I like thinking that way because what a moment that

1412
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,120
would be when someone in our community

1413
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:44,400
starts building hardware like that that is like a laptop

1414
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:44,880
option.

1415
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,420
I mean, who knows what that could be.

1416
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,640
And then you'll have one more laptop to buy, Chris.

1417
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,520
Just what you needed.

1418
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,480
Yeah.

1419
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:51,960
All right.

1420
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,280
Just a quick pick.

1421
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,760
Really, just a quick pick because we

1422
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,360
got to get out of here.

1423
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,400
We don't want it to be a long one,

1424
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,860
but it's starting to get that way.

1425
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:02,840
Wes found a really handy tool to backup your Postgres databases

1426
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,760
into object storage.

1427
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,360
Tell us about it, Mr. Payne.

1428
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,000
It's called PG Horde.

1429
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,160
And yeah, that's basically it.

1430
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,520
It's a Postgres backup daemon that's

1431
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,920
focused just on Postgres and has a special support

1432
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,600
for storing stuff in cloud object stores.

1433
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,800
I like this because the database is kind of special for a lot

1434
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,720
of web applications.

1435
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,580
It's where all of your important data, customer information,

1436
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:24,760
everything that you care.

1437
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,920
For us, it's often show notes or other kinds of stuff

1438
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,280
that we just don't want to lose.

1439
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,360
And it's sure, we run everything in Docker,

1440
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,760
and it's pretty easy to back things up that way.

1441
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,240
But I like the rich support here.

1442
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,320
They've got automatic periodic base backups.

1443
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,120
You can integrate with the transaction log.

1444
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,880
There's optional standalone hot backup support.

1445
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,040
And of course, it just goes and sticks it right in object

1446
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,920
storage, which works really nice for us since we're already

1447
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,120
leveraging that.

1448
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,160
There's encryption support and compression.

1449
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,040
And you can restore directly from a compressed and

1450
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,040
encrypted file in object storage.

1451
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,400
You don't have to download it and do any fancy workflows.

1452
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,200
PG Horde just takes care of it.

1453
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,560
And I know like half of the things we run in containers,

1454
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,240
there's a Postgres running somewhere.

1455
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,560
I'm sure that's true for a lot of other folks.

1456
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,640
So it seemed negligent that we constantly advertise fun

1457
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,640
software to run without also giving you

1458
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,240
a tool to help keep it safe.

1459
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,800
Absolutely, and this is a good one.

1460
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,000
And we've gone on and on about object storage recently,

1461
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,520
but we're just finding other useful ways to take advantage

1462
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,160
of a system like that.

1463
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,120
And it's really simple to just host it even on your own box.

1464
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,440
There's open source projects that make your system

1465
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,040
essentially look like AWS S3.

1466
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,760
And you can just store to a system on your network

1467
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,280
using this, or you could store to systems in the cloud.

1468
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:40,280
And because you have things like Linode and Google Cloud,

1469
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,120
and obviously AWS, and Azure, and lots of other services

1470
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,040
that support object storage, Digital Ocean,

1471
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,880
there's a lot you can choose.

1472
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,240
So you can kind of shop.

1473
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,960
You have a lot of choices there.

1474
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,920
So it's PG Horde, and we will have a link

1475
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,360
to that in the show notes.

1476
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,480
Special thank you to our members, our core contributors

1477
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,920
at unplug.core.

1478
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,920
You help keep this show independent, let us be choosy.

1479
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,080
You give us the leverage to walk away from a deal.

1480
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,240
If we have an ad deal that just doesn't seem like it's

1481
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,360
the right fit, we don't have to be desperate.

1482
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,600
We have our members, and they give us multiple ways

1483
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,600
to remain independent.

1484
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,200
And we're really, really appreciative of that.

1485
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,280
So we give a couple of perks if you become a member

1486
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,920
at unpluggedcore.com.

1487
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,760
You get a limited ad feed, fully produced, sounds great,

1488
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,880
ready to go in the car, just less ads,

1489
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,840
a little bit shorter runtime.

1490
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,840
There's a second feed that's the exact opposite of all that.

1491
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,840
It's the bootleg feed, the full live stream.

1492
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:38,080
Every mess up, every minute we're on air,

1493
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,680
it's super long.

1494
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,280
It's like double the show.

1495
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,600
And there's often a lot of really good conversations

1496
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,640
that just don't get captured when you hit record,

1497
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,480
because that's human nature.

1498
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,720
And that is in that feed.

1499
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,720
So you get two choices.

1500
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:56,760
And you can support the show at the same time, unpluggedcore.com.

1501
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,220
I would love to have you join us live.

1502
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,840
We do this show Tuesdays.

1503
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,120
And we do it at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

1504
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,400
See you next week.

1505
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,000
Same bat time, same bat station.

1506
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,160
And of course, that's at jblive.tv.

1507
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,800
You can get Mumble, then participate in the Luplug

1508
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,000
and participate in our LiveLug.

1509
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,440
And you get a real-time stream.

1510
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,680
And it's free software.

1511
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,480
It's a free software stack from top to bottom

1512
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,440
when you go that route.

1513
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,720
That's a win-win-win.

1514
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,600
Yeah.

1515
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,480
Links to the stuff we talked about today

1516
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,160
at linuxunplug.com slash 389.

1517
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,160
Our contact page is there as well as all our RSS feeds

1518
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,960
and all of that good stuff, including

1519
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,480
Matrix and Mumble server info, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1520
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,800
But I'll let you figure all that out.

1521
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,040
I say it enough.

1522
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,280
I don't need to tell you again.

1523
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,280
Thanks for joining us.

1524
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,480
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1525
00:57:45,480 --> 00:58:15,320
Bye-bye.

1526
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:25,700
JBtitles.com, let's go vote.

1527
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,520
See what we want to call this thing.

1528
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,200
We need your votes.

1529
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,080
So it seemed like we stirred up quite a bit of feedback after the post show last week

1530
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,920
when I mentioned my fedora woes.

1531
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:38,760
I heard from folks on Manjaro and other distributions that we're having the same issue where flat

1532
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:43,440
packs are just non-existent to their plasma desktop, not in the launcher, you can't add

1533
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,720
them to the menu.

1534
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:50,480
It just doesn't seem, and maybe we found a common thing amongst all of us.

1535
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,640
We did a little bugathon off air, I guess, in a way.

1536
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,560
Async bugathon over in matrix.

1537
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,560
Look at that.

1538
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:00,400
And it seemed like, I don't know who, maybe Neil or Carl, I don't know which one of you

1539
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,880
would be best to speak to this, but it seemed like the common thread was everybody had swapped

1540
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:09,320
out their default shell in console, which I don't know how you connect those dots.

1541
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:13,400
But I guess whatever you said is your default shell actually is respected by the rest of

1542
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,440
the plasma desktop session.

1543
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,640
And for whatever reason, that broke things.

1544
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,320
And when you just switch it back to the default, I guess it unbreaks.

1545
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,320
I haven't done it yet.

1546
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,440
I was thinking maybe I'd try it now live on the show.

1547
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,600
I think some of that too was, you know, some folks had changed it with like changing it

1548
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,600
system wide in the shell.

1549
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,600
I'm not sure how what you normally do when you install Phish versus say you can also

1550
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,080
configure just console to launch Phish as your shell.

1551
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:38,720
I think that was maybe the workaround of like, don't change it system wide, but just if you

1552
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,840
want to have console or whatever terminal emulator you're using, launch it for you.

1553
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,680
Oh, I don't think I do set it system wide.

1554
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,680
Hmm.

1555
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,680
So maybe that's not it.

1556
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,680
Let me see.

1557
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,600
I got a lot of user accounts on this one user laptop here.

1558
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,200
I did set it in password.

1559
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,000
I did change it in password.

1560
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,120
I did.

1561
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,880
So you're telling me that's where I have to change it.

1562
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,880
It's worth a shot anyway.

1563
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,720
Switch that back to bash and then.

1564
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,880
I don't even remember doing that.

1565
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,360
I must have just done it right after install and just got it over with.

1566
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:07,640
You were so sick of not having Phish set up that you just did whatever it took.

1567
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,640
I want my auto complete.

1568
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,640
Where's?

1569
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:10,640
Once you're spoiled.

1570
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,640
I mean, it's hard to go back.

1571
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:15,600
Let me just go edit Etsy password with nano real quick.

1572
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,040
Little pro tip for nano.

1573
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:23,160
Tack W for really wide files, which Etsy password is absolutely not.

1574
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,540
But you feel like a pro when you do tack W.

1575
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,800
I thought you had switched to using micro.

1576
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,800
I did.

1577
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,560
But with the new release of nano, I'm back on the nano sauce.

1578
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,720
Someday we'll get him a decent text editor.

1579
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,920
It's when there'll be a terminal only version of VS code.

1580
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:44,760
That's what it'll be.
