1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,220
Alright, I had a little pre-show topic that I didn't think was going to make it, mainly

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:08,980
because I'm still trying to figure out this whole thing, but it seems to be, in the last

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:14,000
couple of weeks, we haven't talked about it on the show, but there has been another resurgence

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,940
of anti-System D sentiment.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,060
People are everything now.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,460
System D is a monster that's eating Linux.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,720
System D is a division between the young and the old.

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,640
System D is a division of core fundamental philosophies of the Unix way versus staying

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,680
competitive in the cloud, blah blah blah.

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,840
It's all of this stuff, and producer Eric here, who's in studio today, linked to an

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,320
article in the subreddit that was written up on infoworld.com by Paul Valencia, and

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,320
he says, choose your side on the Linux divide.

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,580
The battle over System D exposes fundamental gaps between the Unix old guard and the new

14
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,160
guard of Linux developers.

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,520
Is this really a young versus old thing, guys?

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,520
Doesn't feel like it to me.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,520
I don't think so.

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,000
I can see where they're coming from.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
All right, lay it on me.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Go ahead, Rod.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Go ahead.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,400
I was just going to say, it feels like they're just going, no change.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Exactly.

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Yeah.

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Okay.

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,080
What do you think, Colonel Linux?

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
I feel the same way.

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,120
I think that it comes down to a lot of people that have dealt with Linux for years and say,

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,120
I mean, we have this in its system, and it worked, and everything was there, and if we're

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:32,120
going to modify things to go to this top-down approach, all-inclusive approach, rather than,

31
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,600
you know, it goes against the fundamental Linux philosophy, and at the same time, there's

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,360
people like me or a couple other people in our generation that look at it and say, well,

33
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
who cares?

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
If it's better, let's go with that.

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
Yeah, I mean.

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,360
Progress train coming.

37
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,680
I just, I feel like, so here's his fundamental argument.

38
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,080
He says, fundamentally, I think it exposes a separation of the Linux community between

39
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,320
those who were deep into Unix before Linux came onto the scene and those who came later.

40
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,760
I can't help but think that a number of the younger developers and admins are missing

41
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,000
key elements of how Unix-like systems were designed, how they function before, say, 1998,

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,280
when Unix was for servers and high-end workstations, not for desktop systems or laptops.

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
And you see-

44
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
That was the point-

45
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
Are you kidding me?

46
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,080
That was the point that seemed the most questionable to me, because system D, like, the desktop

47
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,640
user doesn't even care about that.

48
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
Right.

49
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
It is for servers.

50
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,640
It's so much for servers.

51
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,600
That's why it's being driven by Red Hat so much.

52
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,160
That's one thing that I liked about having an openSUSE server at home, is that it has

53
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,240
system D. System D is great for server management.

54
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,240
Right.

55
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
Totally.

56
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
You can control your mounts and stuff.

57
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
I mean, it's awesome.

58
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,240
Yeah.

59
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:43,360
I just, okay, so here's what I recognize, is we are sort of consolidating a lot of functionality,

60
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,360
but it seems like a lot of times it's functionality that it hasn't been, maybe it's been left

61
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,360
to sort of wane over the years.

62
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,000
And so nobody's really picking up the slack in a lot of these cases, or times have changed.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,400
You know, having the ability to have your mount system be aware of when your network

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,480
connection goes inactive and active, almost seems like just kind of fundamentally basic

65
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,520
functionality that a modern operating system should have.

66
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,520
Absolutely.

67
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
Exactly.

68
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
Exactly.

69
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:19,600
I don't understand the argument that it's not Unix-like, or it's against the Unix philosophy,

70
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,200
because Linux isn't Unix.

71
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Exactly.

72
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
It hasn't been.

73
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
Exactly.

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,380
If you want to be more Unix-like, use BSD.

75
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,800
But Linux isn't Unix anymore.

76
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,240
Well, but isn't some of the things where it is the most Unix are some of the best things

77
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
about it?

78
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,560
I mean, isn't that what's made some of us drawn to it over, say, Windows or Mac OS

79
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
10?

80
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
Is that it has-

81
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Fair enough.

82
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
Fair enough.

83
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,760
That you should ignore when other things surpass Unix?

84
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,760
Exactly.

85
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,760
Exactly.

86
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,880
I mean, I think that's actually probably the best thing about Linux.

87
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,320
You know, it's a community-driven, you know, whatever works best is what gets adopted.

88
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,600
Everything else gets forked or abandoned.

89
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,440
You know, and so system D is like the natural extension of everything else.

90
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,640
You know, in the subreddit, I'm looking at tire sees he put in there.

91
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,920
Here I was thinking I chose and built my tools by what they could do for me and not their

92
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,840
inherent philosophical values.

93
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,000
People need to be reminded that the Unix philosophy was grounded in the pragmatic reality of computer

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
systems in the 1970s and emphatically not deliberately created as a blind dogma to be repeated and

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,920
followed without comprehension or context.

96
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Absolutely.

97
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,720
Yeah, I guess that's a good point too, right?

98
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Yeah.

99
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,360
Is we shouldn't take something that was a design philosophy influenced by the time and

100
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,480
then make it a credo, almost a constitution, right?

101
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,520
We should, that would be inappropriate.

102
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Exactly.

103
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
That's the way Windows.

104
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
It was never meant to be that.

105
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
What do you mean?

106
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
You mean like what Microsoft does?

107
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,520
Exactly.

108
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,160
Well, and actually I want to underscore that point because I think that's one of the best

109
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,160
things that's kept Linux so nimble is this willingness to re-examine and redo fundamental

110
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,760
parts of the OS that a lot of times there's not an immediate commercial incentive to do

111
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
so.

112
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,380
You know, it's not going to make a great bullet point on the side of Red Hat's, Red Hat Enterprise

113
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,040
Linux box, but that still gets done.

114
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,240
And I think that's fundamentally.

115
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,920
We can, we don't want to move away from that willingness to move forward like that because

116
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,560
we don't want to stagnate like the commercial operating systems have.

117
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
Yeah.

118
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,480
We don't want to end up with HFS plus as a file system.

119
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
Right.

120
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
Exactly.

121
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,480
Or actually butter.

122
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:28,560
But who are we to question our Unix forefathers and try to change their constitution?

123
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,560
Wow.

124
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
Wow.

125
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
We're.

126
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
Trollmugs?

127
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
Wow.

128
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,200
Well, you know, all joking aside though, there is a difference in architecting a society.

129
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,640
A society versus architecting a technology solution because a technology, a society is

130
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,160
fundamentally based on human behaviors and in human nature, but a technology solution

131
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,840
is fundamentally based on something that's always evolving.

132
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,360
Something that's capabilities and requirements, needs, demands are always changing from, I

133
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,760
mean, just over five years, technology changes so much.

134
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,480
So it's, it's not really, I think that's probably the biggest thing to pull from this discussion

135
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,520
is this, it really isn't fair to limit today's systems by a philosophy that was designed

136
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,720
like, like you wouldn't, you wouldn't produce a TV series by the same restrictions that

137
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,440
a TV series had in the 1960s.

138
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,860
But the thing is that like the, the best aspects of Linux survive the best, the worst aspects

139
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,160
of it go away.

140
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,440
And so, so in part of that, the core philosophies that have brought us to this point in history,

141
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,120
you know, either survivor or go away, but you know, ideally they survive, you know,

142
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,080
I mean, it shouldn't be like some sort of preservation, it shouldn't be a museum.

143
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,720
Um, so you, you, we were talking about like one of the great things about Linux writers

144
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:48,560
that, that we have, um, the capability or the, I don't know what the word is, but to,

145
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,320
you know, uh, completely rip out what we have and put in something new, which is true, which

146
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,960
can be a good thing, but we also tend to go too far with that.

147
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
Yeah.

148
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,160
Like look at gnome three when it first started, it was awful.

149
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,520
I love, I mean, I'm a gnome user now, I love it.

150
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:09,560
But gnome three when it first started was awful because we rip out a paradigm or how

151
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,560
I imagined Wayland is going to be right.

152
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
Yeah.

153
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
Yeah.

154
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Yeah.

155
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
Very much so.

156
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,120
And we're going to be reeling these words when we're all switching over to Wayland.

157
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
Oh yeah.

158
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Oh yeah.

159
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
Now looking for, yeah.

160
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,800
Well, and three years later after we switched, after we make the switch, trust me, it'll all

161
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
work fine.

162
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Right.

163
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,760
And it will be, it'll be like, oh yeah, we had to, we, we had to, that's exactly the

164
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,760
most logical thing to do.

165
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,760
It was the only way forward.

166
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Yeah.

167
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,760
No breaks on the progress train.

168
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
Yeah.

169
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,200
And people, people seem a lot more cautious these days than they did when I first started

170
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,640
using Linux like five, six years ago.

171
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
Yeah.

172
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,840
Maybe that's a sign people are using it for more serious things.

173
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
Yep.

174
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
Yeah.

175
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,960
This is one of those things where it seems like it's a, almost a liberal, liberal versus

176
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,960
conservative argument.

177
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,720
Well, and it also feels a little bit of growing up, like the Linux that, the Linux that we

178
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,280
played with years ago isn't, now Linux is an adult and it's not the same Linux anymore.

179
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
It's not a toy anymore.

180
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
Yeah.

181
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,280
Right.

182
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,080
It's used in production and we need it for our tool chain and we need it to, yeah, blah,

183
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
blah, blah.

184
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,240
It's not, it's not the fledgling little, remember, hey, you guys remember that the number one

185
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,040
phrase that used to be appended before the word Linux in any article was the grassroots

186
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,360
project, the grassroots initiative Linux.

187
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,360
Oh my gosh.

188
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
Remember grassroots?

189
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
How much we used to hear grassroots?

190
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,160
Well, now Linux is the number one operating system on the planet, right?

191
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
So it's not grassroots.

192
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
It has roots.

193
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,240
Well, so if it's being used for that, if it's being used for that, you know, art, fundamental

194
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,240
architecture, then continuously ripping out things isn't good because no, I would have

195
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,520
a hard time not being a Linux user, looking at Linux and seeing that, you know, you rip

196
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,020
out, you, you rip out everything and bring in Pulse Audio and then you have audio issues

197
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,600
and then you rip out the display server and now we're going to have display issues.

198
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,720
Well, I would have a hard time switching to Linux were I not, you know, that's why, why

199
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,200
the fork is simultaneously one of the most disruptive things in open source and simultaneously

200
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,120
one of the best things in open source because you can have a company fork something and

201
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,720
they can have an LTS release for a while that rides that out, right?

202
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,840
That just sort of waits it out and then switches over or you can have a company that's delivering

203
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,140
a product on a phone or on a router that can maintain their own fork internally and continue

204
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,240
to, you know, churn out whatever it is they have to bang on for a while and then until

205
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,480
things stabilize again.

206
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,840
So it does mean a little bit of in-house investment, but it's way better than having to invent

207
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,440
the entire operating system from the ground up.

208
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,740
Or to have to recreate your entire tool chain when Windows decides to go to Windows 8 or

209
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,440
whatever and destroys everything else that, you know, you had previously, you know what

210
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
I'm saying?

211
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
I mean, come on.

212
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,340
And that's where community comes in to Linux.

213
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,960
That's why community is such a, you know, awesome thing.

214
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,720
And hence we finally have a Mate version of Ubuntu.

215
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,680
Thank you very much.

216
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,760
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's powered by delicious smoky

217
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,760
cheddar.

218
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
My name is Chris.

219
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,760
And my name is Matt.

220
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
Hey there, Matt.

221
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,560
We've got a fun show today, a lot coming up.

222
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,720
And to make it a little extra special, producer Eric is in the studio with us right now.

223
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
Hey there, Eric.

224
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Hey, Chris.

225
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
How you doing?

226
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
I'm good.

227
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Glad to have you here today.

228
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Yeah, thanks.

229
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Thanks for eating my meat before the show, too.

230
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
You know, that was good meat.

231
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm going to, I'll be honest, right up front, it was really thick and it didn't melt all

232
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
the way.

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah.

234
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So we had softened smoky cheddar.

235
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah.

236
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,560
It was still good, but it was just a little thick to bite into.

237
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,900
Some of it had to come off, unfortunately.

238
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,680
So you know what I did?

239
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,320
I'm not one to take just a big block of cheddar on my, I mean, I like, but I got to be careful,

240
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
right?

241
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
And if I'm going to go for it, it's got to be right.

242
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,600
It's got to be worth the pain.

243
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,440
So I took a whole row of sliced hot onion right off the barbecue, 550 degree onion.

244
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,920
Put it down on top of the cheese and that, and that onion melted into the cheese, Matt.

245
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Why am I talking about this?

246
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,720
I guess I'm still, I'm still a little hungry.

247
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,480
Are you going to like Skype message me a burger or how's this going to work?

248
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,480
You know what I mean?

249
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,480
Sorry, Matt.

250
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
I know.

251
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,040
I shouldn't talk about it unless I brought one for the whole class.

252
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,960
Although the man does provide bacon of a morning when I come into the show.

253
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
That's true.

254
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
Yeah.

255
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
So I'm okay.

256
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
I'm okay.

257
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
All right.

258
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,720
Well, hey chat room, please don't forget to bang suggest as we go along on today's show.

259
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,680
We've got a lot to cover, including some more exclusive interviews from LinuxCon 2014.

260
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,920
Noah's also here to give us his impression from the floor and tell us a little bit of

261
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,960
behind the scenes from the trip.

262
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,520
There's an article that also came out that wants us all to just shut up about Linux on

263
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,520
the desktop.

264
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
Just shut up.

265
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,520
Stop talking about it.

266
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,440
And I think we're going to have to talk about it a little bit.

267
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,920
And as well, we also are going to do, it is something new we're doing at least once a

268
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,580
month for a little while.

269
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,240
We're going to take a little look back at Linux from years ago and this is our last

270
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,480
chance to do it for the month of August.

271
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,200
So we'll take a retrospective look back at Linux from five and 10 years ago.

272
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
Some interesting stuff in there for you guys.

273
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,480
But first I want to start with our feedback as is something we like to do on the unplug

274
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
show.

275
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,520
And a Texas Linux user wrote in.

276
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,320
You guys might remember Texas Linux user.

277
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,080
He wrote in a couple of weeks ago about switching from a Linux box to a Mac.

278
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,880
He says, hello Chris, Matt, Arcee and of course the mumble room.

279
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,400
Well I didn't realize that my email would cause such a stir even across multiple shows.

280
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,680
First let me say I just haven't switched to the Mac yet but I still plan on doing so.

281
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,440
With that said, let me express some thoughts after hearing your discussion going on across

282
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
the shows.

283
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,000
In both Coderadio and Linux Unplugged, Chris mentioned I should try out elementary OS.

284
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,440
He says I'm actually already an elementary OS user.

285
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,760
He's been running on a Dell.

286
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,360
The reason I use EOS, don't call it that, was because it solved a big problem that I

287
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360
had.

288
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,080
Finding a decent desktop that just let me get my work done.

289
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,160
I can't begin to describe how frustrating using any other desktop environment has been.

290
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,000
Elementary OS solved this by a long shot.

291
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,380
No other desktop has even been close for me.

292
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,680
So let me give the listeners a chance for their head to stop spinning.

293
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,680
But I mean it.

294
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,720
No other Linux desktop is even close.

295
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,840
All right, the past several weeks across JB shows, you and Matt have been kind of griping

296
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,280
about how most Linux desktops are kind of missing that special thing that would propel

297
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,880
them into the mainstream.

298
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,560
It seemed as if there was no desktop that was just right and I'm here to say that's

299
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,640
absolutely true.

300
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,880
There is no desktop that fills the dream of Linux desktop.

301
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,440
Because Linux dream is just that.

302
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
It's just a dream.

303
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,300
A dream that every Linux user has, but a thing we forget to or we ignore is that no one dream,

304
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,640
no one dream, no one has the same dream.

305
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,800
We all dream different things and want different things.

306
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,040
We as a community have fooled ourselves into thinking we could bring together this group

307
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,660
dream to a life we can't.

308
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,640
Why is elementary OS project doing such a good job of building a decent distro?

309
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
Simple.

310
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,920
People dream the Linux desktop ideal and focus on core improvement design ideals like the

311
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,440
human interface guidelines that they have.

312
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,460
The other reason why elementary OS folks stick out so much better is because they aren't

313
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,460
making design choices out of the blue.

314
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,460
They have a guideline.

315
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,460
They stick to it.

316
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,220
And they have a technological underpinning of an OS that can stick to those guidelines.

317
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,640
Before EOS came along, I was distro hopping like crazy because I was chasing that dream

318
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,140
of the Linux desktop.

319
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,120
After a week of using EOS, I realized what an idiot I was for all of that.

320
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,760
In the end, I'll be switching to the Mac, but I won't cease to be a Linux user.

321
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,840
I do have another machine that will run Linux, but switching solves two very big problems

322
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
that plague Linux.

323
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,220
A desktop that doesn't get in your way and lets you work and good hardware that just

324
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,540
works out of the box.

325
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,720
Thanks for the great show.

326
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,280
As of yet, still a Texas Linux user.

327
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,100
He had me till the last two things and then he just literally factually gave a single

328
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,520
user experience versus a collective user experience.

329
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,520
Right.

330
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,520
True.

331
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,160
It's just like, um, actually, no, but okay.

332
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,360
Yeah.

333
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,040
So a couple of things I take issue with.

334
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,000
So one thing that I think is kind of a common thing that a lot of Linux users repeat is

335
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,960
there's no desktop gets it just right.

336
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,720
I have to keep switching around because I'm never happy.

337
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,520
And what I, I used to feel that way too.

338
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,600
And then I realized that almost the option of having choice makes you constantly want

339
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,720
to jump around just a little bit.

340
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,200
And when you just settle down and just stick to a desktop and just learn to work with it,

341
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,160
because this is what elementary OS and Mac OS present the user.

342
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,800
You have no choice but to use this desktop.

343
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,440
So therefore your choice is I will then learn how to modify this desktop in just the slight

344
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,520
ways that I need a granted, I'm not, I'm not dismissing it whole cloth.

345
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,800
They have to start somewhere really reasonable.

346
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,080
That's really well done.

347
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,840
And then they move then as the user, you then just move that to the, to the position you

348
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,640
needed to be in and you just, that's the only choice you have.

349
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,840
So therefore you make it work.

350
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,120
You learn one desktop.

351
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
There's not a lot of options.

352
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,000
You're not constantly considering the grass on the other side of that fence.

353
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,400
It's not that kind of scenario.

354
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
You just double down.

355
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,280
If I pretended like there was no other desktop environment in the world for Linux except

356
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,240
for Gnome, if we all did that, like if just one day we all woke up and there was no other

357
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,440
desktop except for Gnome, we would all just figure out how to make it work for the most.

358
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,280
A lot of people would leave, but I think a lot of people would just stop their hopping

359
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,800
around or Katie or whatever.

360
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
What do you think, Eric?

361
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,520
Well, I'm thinking, I see different desktops as different tools.

362
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,920
You know, you have your Gnome desktop, which I spend most of my time in, especially if

363
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,300
I'm leisurely using my computer, but if I need to do anything developmentally or if

364
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,300
I need to, say, mass upload a whole bunch of pictures that I have in a folder to Facebook

365
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,120
or wherever, then I'm going to grab and get into KDE because I've got skipping colors.

366
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,160
So you switch just based on the workload of the day.

367
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,160
That's correct.

368
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,720
One's like your work desktop, one's your play desktop.

369
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,880
Yeah, exactly.

370
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,720
And depending on the situation, heck, I'll even use Windows if it warrants a need.

371
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,880
So do you feel like you have the sensation that no one desktop is quite doing it for

372
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
you?

373
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Yeah, absolutely.

374
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,800
Because the different desktops have different focuses and different tool sets.

375
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Well, okay.

376
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,360
But, or is it that you have learned workflows in those other desktops and so to you it feels

377
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,200
that way, but if you learned the workflow under Gnome, for example, like I'll give you

378
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,280
an example, like this is just a small example, but under KDE you can modify the KDE screenshot

379
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,200
application to upload right to Imgur.

380
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,880
Under Gnome, not so much.

381
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
There's ways to do it.

382
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
So I switched to Shutter.

383
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,400
On the Mac, it would be the same exact thing.

384
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,120
You're never going to build in Imgur upload directly into Mac OS X.

385
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,240
So on the Mac, I get a screenshot tool that just uploads to Imgur.

386
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,560
Therefore my workflow works on either desktop.

387
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,040
One requires a little more work, but at the end of the day, I can accomplish the same

388
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,720
task on either one.

389
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,820
So sticking with the Mac, I would have no option but to go the Imgur app route.

390
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,800
And so I wouldn't see that as a, oh, well, Gnome can't do something that KDE can.

391
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,340
I see that as a, well, that's not built in, so I just got to go find something that does

392
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,340
it.

393
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:21,080
So I guess what I'm saying is, to me, it seems like not having a choice of desktop forces

394
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,320
you to rethink the way you look at a problem.

395
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:32,820
And it's not that the Mac interface is some amazing development of design and user interface.

396
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,760
It's that it's good enough, it does essentially what it needs to do, and you really have no

397
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
other choice.

398
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,960
Yeah, and then you just add options and tools on top of that to make it do what you need

399
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
it to do.

400
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,400
And I could say you could do that with just about any Linux desktop environment.

401
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,800
Yes, granted, I do use Gnome most of the time, but like I said, I will jump into KDE if I

402
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,160
need Dolphin to do its thing or what have you.

403
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,520
Let us know how it goes, Texas Linux user.

404
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,040
Next email comes in from XY, and this is maybe one we could get the Mumble Room's thoughts

405
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
on.

406
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,480
He says, Dear Chris and Matt, I'm a Windows user that switched to Arch Linux.

407
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,640
It took me, I love this, as a Windows user, here's what I hear.

408
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,160
It took me two days to set up a proper install with encryption and LVM.

409
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,680
I installed a minimal version of Gnome 3.12 and all seemed great.

410
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,560
But then I discovered Gnome's geolocation package, GeoClue, and it's not removable because

411
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,540
it's integrated into Gnome.

412
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,440
This makes me so mad.

413
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,640
Do you trust the disable option in this?

414
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,280
So I thought, who better to ask than our gurus, Chris and Matt, and I'm going to also throw

415
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,240
the Mumble Room in on this, how can I remove the geolocation feature from Gnome?

416
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
Thanks in advance, Mike.

417
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,240
Well, if it was me, I would just try XFCE.

418
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,000
I would flip this around like, why did it not bother you in Windows?

419
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,200
You know, like the Windows has the same thing.

420
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,600
All the NSA tagging and all the other stuff going on, that was fine, but oh no, Gnome.

421
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,800
So I'm sure this is there for like time zone functionality and things like that, right?

422
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
That's pretty much it.

423
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,960
I mean, I'm looking at the option right now.

424
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,480
Right now I have location disabled.

425
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
Yeah.

426
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,440
I do trust that and here's why, because that code is open and if that code didn't do what

427
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,720
it's supposed to do, eventually somebody would say that and go, hey, a minute, this is not

428
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
disabling anything.

429
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
Yeah.

430
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
And it'd be a big controversy.

431
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
Oh yeah.

432
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
Useless button, red flag.

433
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,920
So by default, I kind of have a little more trust, but I don't know.

434
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
Yeah.

435
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,920
I agree.

436
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,480
I think we should just suggest that he go and audit the code if he's really that concerned

437
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,480
about it.

438
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
For real.

439
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,480
It's an option.

440
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
Or have somebody he trusts audit the code that can.

441
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,480
Or hire someone.

442
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
Yeah.

443
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:40,720
I mean, to me, think about what would be the motivation to put a button in an open source

444
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,160
UI that controls open source software on an open platform where anybody has access to

445
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
the code.

446
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Exactly.

447
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,760
What would be the motivation to make a button that doesn't do what it says to do in that

448
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:57,020
scenario because it's not like it takes some decompiling and some super secret hacker investigations

449
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,160
to sniff packet captures and compare it with time and date stamps and geolocation.

450
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,440
No, it doesn't take any of that.

451
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,920
It just takes somebody to look at the code and go, yeah, this is bullshit.

452
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,760
So there's a middle ground though, because remember when Canonical had the little turn

453
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,320
off online search results, it was doing what it said it was going to do.

454
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,000
It was telling applications that you shouldn't render those search results online.

455
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,680
But if I remember right, it was a flag that the applications had to choose to obey.

456
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
That's true.

457
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,680
That's very true.

458
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
That's very true.

459
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
I don't know.

460
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,080
I think that's a little different because it wasn't a central location lookup service,

461
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
right?

462
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,080
I don't know.

463
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,080
Yeah, but that's a great point.

464
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,080
It's worth being skeptical.

465
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,080
I'm not making fun of them for being skeptical.

466
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,880
By the way, one program I know that uses GeoClue in the background is Redshift because

467
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,080
then it determines where you are on the planet and sets your screen temperature accordingly

468
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,640
depending on if it's nighttime or daytime.

469
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,640
Yep.

470
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
It definitely is.

471
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
That's definitely one of them.

472
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,640
Yeah.

473
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,640
Yeah.

474
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
There's a few in there.

475
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
And I use it too.

476
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,040
I don't even bother disabling it because this is why I use an open source operating system

477
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,200
to begin with this so I can have some level of comfort in these features.

478
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,680
I think it is good to be vigilant.

479
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,680
Right.

480
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,680
Yeah.

481
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
Right.

482
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
Absolutely.

483
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
Speaking of being vigilant, you know what else you should be vigilant of?

484
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
Your mind.

485
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,560
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and go educate yourself a little bit.

486
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
You want to get into development?

487
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,240
You want to learn how to program?

488
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,840
You want to know a little bit about AWS or just the basics of Linux just to cover in

489
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,120
those gaps for maybe when you self-taught yourself?

490
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,000
You'd be surprised how effective it is when you go over and just use a little bit of training

491
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,680
to fill in some things that perhaps you didn't pick up along the way.

492
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,120
Even somebody like myself who's been using Linux since the 90's, I've taken a couple

493
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,400
of these courses and been really thankful that I did.

494
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,240
I've discovered there's been little things that I could have been doing to make my life

495
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
easier.

496
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,360
So go check out linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

497
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,200
Take advantage of the Summer of Learning Savings.

498
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,040
It's just going on for a little bit longer.

499
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,360
And Linux Academy is awesome.

500
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,840
They have step-by-step video courses, comprehensive downloadable study guides, seven plus Linux

501
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,280
distributions you get to choose from, and then they'll automatically adjust the courseware

502
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,600
to match that Linux distribution, which is awesome.

503
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,280
And for me, because I have a horrible memory, I love that they have all of my progress.

504
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,480
Everything's right there in a dashboard.

505
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,520
When I log in, I can check right where I was, pick up, I could go back a little bit, I could

506
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:16,520
self-test, and they really break down individually how long each little part's going to take.

507
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,320
So for me, who's somebody a little bit OCD about, well, if I'm going to sit down and

508
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,880
do this, I want to make sure I have enough time.

509
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,360
And I love that I say, okay, you know what, I can get 25 minutes in tonight.

510
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,920
And then I walk away really feeling like I've accomplished something and intellectually stimulated

511
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
myself.

512
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,640
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged, this is a great opportunity to get your skill sets

513
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
up on AWS.

514
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,760
They have end-to-end scenario training where you'll actually walk away having deployed

515
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,560
something in a very production-like environment because they're spinning up AWS instances

516
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,560
on the background.

517
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,560
They're using S3.

518
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,560
They're using EC2.

519
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,800
They're having you deploy an application in those scenarios.

520
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,760
If you need to learn OpenStack, they've got a lot of comprehensive guides on OpenStack,

521
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,720
more content all the time, including live stream events where you can ask the educators questions

522
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
about OpenStack.

523
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,040
And then to top it all off, they have a community that's packed full of people trying to learn

524
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,040
and people who are experts, and they can give you that little nudge when you need a little

525
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
more.

526
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,160

And go look at all of the awesome Linux courses they have.

531
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,300
If you're ready to get your certifications, LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged, and a huge

532
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,040
thank you to LinuxAcademy for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

533
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
Good stuff.

534
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,920
Great, great, great service for you guys.

535
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,220
I'm so happy to have them as sponsors.

536
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,120
Go check them out, even just to learn a little more to thank them as a way to just say thanks

537
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
for sponsoring the show.

538
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,120
Go to LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

539
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
All right.

540
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,440
We've got two more emails to get to before we get to our LinuxCon interviews.

541
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,480
And our next one comes in from Alec.

542
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,320
And he's following up on a topic from a while back.

543
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,880
He says, hey, Chris, Matt, chat room, mumble room.

544
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,520
A couple of months ago, you were discussing the usage of open source in schools and had

545
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,720
received a lot of feedback saying that a lot of the IT curriculum is not well designed

546
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,400
and does not really incorporate Linux and free software.

547
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,480
I have found that not to be the case.

548
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm 13 and I run Gentoo on my custom-built rig and Ubuntu on my DigitalOcean VPS.

549
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,260
I have found that the IT teachers in my school have been knowledgeable about Linux and have

550
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,360
encouraged its general use.

551
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,640
I find there's a lot of enthusiasm for Linux in younger computer users as well.

552
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,640
Thanks for all the great shows.

553
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
Alec.

554
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
I'd like to know where this kid lives.

555
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
That's some great news, right?

556
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,640
Yeah.

557
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,120
I was going to say, I think Venue plays a lot in it.

558
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,440
I think it depends on where you live.

559
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,280
On certain communities, I certainly think that's the truth, especially in places like

560
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,280
Canada.

561
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,400
I know they're really big in Linux there.

562
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
But here in the Northwest, I think it's kind of hit and miss.

563
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Yeah.

564
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,680
I mean, we do have that Microsoft backyard culture that could be influencing our perspective

565
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
on it.

566
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:39,360
You know, I was very lucky that when I was in high school, Linux was very early and my

567
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,200
teacher had heard of it and he was cool with giving it a shot.

568
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,920
In my school, it was just some students, a group of students got together and said, hey,

569
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
let's give this a shot.

570
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,280
And then the school faculty who had a contract with Microsoft said, ah, no.

571
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,280
Really?

572
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,280
I had a similar experience.

573
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,680
As a Canadian, I can say that when I went through high school, everything was Microsoft.

574
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:08,600
And I've talked to members of the local users group here and they've talked about the same

575
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,360
kind of problems with getting Linux into schools that you've mentioned on the show.

576
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,080
So I think it might depend on the province to some extent.

577
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,840
I'm sure it could depend on the district and their, you know, their culture, their deals.

578
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
Oh, yeah.

579
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,840
I mean, certainly.

580
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,720
I can at least speak to my own school district.

581
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:31,040
This year, we all got Chromebooks, which, I mean, the first thing I did when I got it

582
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:36,720
was install Ubuntu in a CH root and, you know, and then I've been charging my friends $15

583
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
to do it on theirs.

584
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
Good man.

585
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
I like this guy.

586
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Yeah.

587
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:47,040
The funny thing about it, the funny thing about it is they've had these awful issues

588
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,400
with their web proxy that they send all our traffic through.

589
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,840
And so like in the middle of class, like people will be working on their Google docs or whatever

590
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,400
and it'll just, you know, disconnect.

591
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,800
And so I was in my AP biology class with this other kid that I'd installed Linux on.

592
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,760
And so all of a sudden everyone starts raising their hands and like their stuff isn't working

593
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,600
and like they can't connect to anything.

594
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,080
And only the two of us, it is only the two of us that have a working internet connection.

595
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,160
It was pretty great.

596
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
That's a nice win.

597
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
I like how he thinks too.

598
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
Yeah.

599
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,160
That is, that's very clever.

600
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Are you using Crouton?

601
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,800
What are you doing to install a Ubuntu on there within the church?

602
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Yeah.

603
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Nice.

604
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,800
Oh, that's clever, dude.

605
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Good for you.

606
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
And it may, and you know what?

607
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
It's a win for the kids too.

608
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
15 bucks.

609
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,320
And now they've just turned that computer into a computer and mostly they, they mostly

610
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,880
want it so they can, cause if you do that, it doesn't go through their web proxy anymore.

611
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,840
So you can get to Netflix and get to all that kind of stuff.

612
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
Nice.

613
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,840
That is, that is really great.

614
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
Ingenious.

615
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
That's great to hear.

616
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,840
And you know what?

617
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,380
That makes me, cause that, that makes me happy that Chromebooks are doing so well in schools

618
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,560
because it means every kid that gets a Chromebook potentially has that option.

619
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
That's right.

620
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,360
And it just takes a little initiative to do it or a friend that will charge you 15 bucks.

621
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,360
Yeah.

622
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,080
And you know that that's not entirely out of their realm.

623
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,000
I mean, look at what, look at what Linux supporters do every day.

624
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Yeah.

625
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
They support Linux in the background.

626
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Yeah.

627
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Dude's on his way to a contracting gig.

628
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
That's right.

629
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
He's going to be an IT consultant soon.

630
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
That's right.

631
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Exactly.

632
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Uh, okay.

633
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,880
There are the students that, that say, I can't believe you're charging 15 bucks to type stuff

634
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,880
into a computer.

635
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,840
You're like, do you know how to type that stuff?

636
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
That's right.

637
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,840
Yeah.

638
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
Exactly.

639
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,840
There's people that make millions of dollars a year typing things into a computer.

640
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,520
You say, welcome to the knowledge economy, sucker.

641
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,340
You know, at this conference I was at in Coeur d'Alene a couple of weeks ago, I was telling

642
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,480
somebody about Linux and they're like, well, if it's free, what do you have to pay for

643
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
it?

644
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
Like the knowledge of the person.

645
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
Think about like a doctor.

646
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
If you go to the doctor, you pay them for their knowledge, not any product.

647
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,480
I can cut you for free, but knowing how to cut you is what's important.

648
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
That's right.

649
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
That's right.

650
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,480
That's a great analogy, Alex.

651
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Yeah.

652
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
Yeah.

653
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Uh, all right.

654
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
So we have, uh, one more email.

655
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,480
It comes in from friend of the show, Stevo.

656
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,920
He writes in from time to time and he says, hi Chris, I came across this and it looks

657
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,080
like something that's right up your alley.

658
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,200
It's a Kickstarter project.

659
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,240
Now you guys know, I don't, I, if we, if we talk about Kickstarter projects all the time,

660
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,160
I could have, we could have a whole show about Kickstarters every week, but from time to

661
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:04,400
time there's a game that comes out on Kickstarter that, uh, scratches my funny bone in my special

662
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,340
place that makes me, I even decided to back the game because they already out of the box

663
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:16,920
have got Linux support and it is a old school, uh, platformer looking game, 8-bit style goodness.

664
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,800
Uh, they have 993 backers.

665
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
They're trying to get to $50,000.

666
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,920
They're at $28,000 right now with 10 days to go.

667
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:30,960
This game looks like a cross between Mario, Metroid, um, uh, I'm trying to, I'm blanking

668
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,160
on some other games, but the first thing I thought of was Metroid just straight off the

669
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
bat.

670
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Yeah.

671
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,880
And they've got like some great, uh, some great videos and, uh, some great, uh, GIFs

672
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,240
and it looks like a ton of work's already been done on the game and it already has a

673
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,160
working Linux port too.

674
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,000
So yeah, that I did with that.

675
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,200
I decided, you know, if there already has a working Linux port, I'm going to go ahead

676
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
and back it.

677
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,800
So I backed it for 15 bucks and you get, you get access to the games.

678
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:58,320
They're going to release it on Linux, uh, Mac, PC, or I guess Windows and the Wii U

679
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,320
they say.

680
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Via Steam apparently.

681
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
Yeah.

682
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Via Steam.

683
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,040
So I'm just going to put a link in the show notes if you guys want to check it out.

684
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040
Stevo, I recommend it.

685
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,560
He's got good taste and, uh, I watched the video and I decided to back it.

686
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:15,120
And I, for me, my Kickstarter rule for games is, uh, I don't do games that either if they

687
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,840
have stretch goal for Linux, I don't back them until they've reached it or I don't back

688
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,360
them unless they upfront say Linux support.

689
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,360
Yeah.

690
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,800
Some people tease me with Linux support because they don't, you know, you never know if you're

691
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,840
going to get it.

692
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,520
So at this game, they're staying right out of the gate.

693
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,520
They're doing Linux.

694
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,120
It looks like a cool project too.

695
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,520
So it's, uh, the game by the way is called Hive Jump if you want to look for it directly

696
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,840
on the Kickstarter.

697
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,320
We have a link in the show notes.

698
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
Thanks Stevo for sending that in.

699
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,520
If you guys see something that's really awesome in the Linux dimension on Kickstarter, uh,

700
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,520
you can always email it in.

701
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,360
Go over to jupiterbroadcasting.com, click the contact link and choose Linux Unplugged

702
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,480
from the drop down or Linux Action Show.

703
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
If I'll leave that to you.

704
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,280
It's based on your timing, your sense of timing.

705
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,680
Earlier in the week, probably should go to Unplugged.

706
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,320
Later in the week, Linux Action Show.

707
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,320
You know what?

708
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,320
I'm not going to put that on you.

709
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,320
I'm not going to put that on you.

710
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,640
You guys can decide.

711
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
You guys can decide.

712
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,640
Flip a coin.

713
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,640
All right.

714
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,640
So let's shift gears to LinuxCon 2014.

715
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,080
Uh, in fact, before we do that, I'll stop and I'll thank Ting.

716
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,080
Everybody right now.

717
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,080
Hey, do me a favor.

718
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,080
Do me a solid.

719
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,780
Go to linux.ting.com right now, linux.ting.com.

720
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,080
Everybody do it, linux.ting.com.

721
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,080
And here's why.

722
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,400
Go to linux.ting.com, that's going to get you a $25 credit for your first month of Ting

723
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,320
or more if you bring your own Ting device.

724
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,480
If you don't have a Ting device, they're going to take $25 off your first phone.

725
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,920
Real talk everybody, you got suckered into buying contracts and phones that are really

726
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
not good for you.

727
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,920
They're not good for you financially.

728
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,600
They're not good for the soul.

729
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,020
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

730
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:42,140
No contract, no determination fee, and you only pay for what you use.

731
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,920
It starts at a flat $6 per month.

732
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,040
Then they just take your minutes, your messages.

733
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,040
Then your megabytes.

734
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,720
They add them all up, and that's just what you pay, plus any taxes that might be applicable.

735
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,480
Linux.ting.com, try out their savings calculator.

736
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,640
Ting has such an awesome setup here.

737
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,480
And if you think about if we could go back in time, like if we all had DeLoreans, get

738
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,480
them up to 88 miles per hour, we got those awesome Doc Brown sunglasses that he totally

739
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,200
couldn't see anything out of, and you got your old man makeup on because you're going

740
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
back in time.

741
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Right?

742
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
I mean, real talk everybody, right?

743
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Real talk.

744
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
No BS.

745
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,760
You're going back in time to restructure the mobile industry.

746
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,800
Let's not kid ourselves.

747
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,640
You'd do it just like Ting's doing it, right?

748
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,560
You'd have no hold customer service, 1855 Ting FTW, anytime between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.

749
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,040
A real Canadian answers the phone.

750
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,000
That Canadian isn't just polite.

751
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,880
They're actually empowered to solve your problems.

752
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,280
They're actually Android fans.

753
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,320
Oh, and did you know you can go get the Nexus 5 directly from Ting's website?

754
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,320
Boom.

755
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,360
You own that Nexus 5.

756
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,080
It's no contract, straight out.

757
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,080
It's your phone.

758
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,140
Just like when you go buy a laptop, you own that laptop, and if you just want to use Ting

759
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,600
for the data, you can.

760
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,120
Personally, I'm almost all Wi-Fi calling these days, and it's amazing.

761
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,680
I've currently got three active phones on my Ting account, and I am paying less than

762
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,080
all you fools in the other contracts out there.

763
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,640
Paying less than all you guys.

764
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,640
Linux.ting.com.

765
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,640
How's your Nexus 5?

766
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
My Nexus 5 is great.

767
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,600
Yeah, you just got that cool gamepad controller, too.

768
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
Yes, I did.

769
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,440
The Mocha gamepad, the pocket one, it just fits right in the palm of my hand.

770
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,440
Yeah, buddy.

771
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,440
You can take it anywhere.

772
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,440
Score.

773
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,440
Yeah, it's really neat.

774
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,880
The HTC phones, the Nexus 5, some amazing phones, Ting's got them.

775
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880
The iPhones are great.

776
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,880
Ting's got them.

777
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,920
They also have just dedicated hotspot and tethering if you just want to have some mobile

778
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,920
data.

779
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
$6 hotspot, you guys.

780
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
You buy it once.

781
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
You go to linux.ting.com.

782
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,840
They're going to take $25 off, and then you have a hotspot.

783
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,000
You can put it in your bag.

784
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Put it in your MERS.

785
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Put it in your purse.

786
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Put it in your drawer.

787
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It's a $6 hotspot.

788
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
You need data.

789
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You turn it on.

790
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You've got data.

791
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Come on.

792
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It makes so much sense.

793
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Linux.ting.com.

794
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Try out the savings calculator.

795
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,160
Just put in your actual usage, not the gimmick you're paying into that you may or may not

796
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,400
be using all of.

797
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:44,420
Put your actual usage into that savings calculator, and then sit back and go, I could buy a laptop

798
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:49,760
every couple of years with that savings, linux.ting.com, and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring

799
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
Linux Unplugged.

800
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,620
Okay, so let's get in the Mamba Room, and we'll start.

801
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,320
So Noah, if you're in here with us, I'm going to play a couple of these interviews, and

802
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,460
then after they wrap up, if you have any extra things you want to add to them or anything

803
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,400
like that, you'll have the floor.

804
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,600
I thought we should probably start with the one that seemed to interest you the most.

805
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:14,040
You seem to really enjoy your chat with Matt from Cumulus Networks about their Linux software

806
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,720
networking infrastructure.

807
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,480
So I teased part one in Linux Action Show on Sunday.

808
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,720
Let's start with part two, where you could see Noah starting to get really interested.

809
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,800
He's like, okay, wait a minute here.

810
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,480
If I was going to implement this, how would that look?

811
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,280
And so that's where this discussion starts out.

812
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,220
If you didn't catch our coverage on Linux Action Show on Sunday, Cumulus Networks is

813
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:38,560
working on replacing extremely high-end Cisco-type networking equipment with Linux-powered infrastructure.

814
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:43,080
So when you need to manage an interface on a switch, for example, you use ifconfig.

815
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,080
It's amazing.

816
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,080
It's crazy.

817
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,080
And it's here today.

818
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,080
Okay.

819
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,440
Now, one of the things that I would be looking at from a system administration standpoint

820
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,240
is how difficult is it to move from one infrastructure to the other?

821
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,680
So for example, what routing protocols are supported?

822
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:02,560
I mean, if I'm coming from a Cisco environment, for example, I'm sure there's going to be

823
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:07,680
some routing protocols that just aren't open standards, and so they're not going to be

824
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,960
able to be used with Cumulus Linux.

825
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,520
Can you speak a little bit about that?

826
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Yeah.

827
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,680
So we have a partnership with Quagga, which is a well-known open-source routing suite,

828
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,720
and that includes very stable support for both BGP and OSPF.

829
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,040
And so that's both, again, for IPv4 and IPv6.

830
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,080
Now, our focus today is mostly in the data center, and that's in a layer-three-cloth

831
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,080
design.

832
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,840
Essentially, what that means is you have leaf and spine.

833
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,480
It's a very horizontally scalable infrastructure.

834
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,800
It's typically what the big boys do.

835
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,000
If you look at a Facebook or an Amazon, they're pretty much all geared to that infrastructure.

836
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,360
Now, they may run kind of a virtual network on top of that, just as they may use virtualization

837
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:48,140
for their compute, but the underpinnings are traditionally a large, scalable layer-three.

838
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,760
So those are our two main routing protocols.

839
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,720
We also have a number of protocols supported for layer-two.

840
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,360
So obviously, the very basic would be something like LLDP, which is similar to CDP, a way

841
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:06,060
of discovering ports on the network, up to things like MLag-like functionality.

842
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:10,680
So you can have two switches act as one to a particular downstream host.

843
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,320
So we're continuing to add features both in the layer-two and layer-three space, but we're

844
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,360
predominantly in the layer-three side, and BGP and OSPF are our most well-tested protocols,

845
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,080
and that's what pretty much 99% of our customers use.

846
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,080
Perfect.

847
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:29,900
And what would you consider the ideal green environment for, I want to use Cumulus Network,

848
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,600
how do I implement that?

849
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,960
What would be your ideal customer?

850
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,480
What do you think the best fit for somebody that's maybe looking for your product?

851
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,920
Well, today we focus mostly on Broadcom-based products, and so Broadcom has a huge majority

852
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,920
of the market.

853
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,660
So when you look at a lot of data centers, switches, these are 10 gig, 40 gig, even one

854
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,800
gig switches, again, from Adele or Cisco or Juniper.

855
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,900
They have the lion's share of the market.

856
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,920
And so we focus mostly on the 10 gig and 40 gig spot at this time.

857
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,000
So for smaller businesses, we don't have, I would say, kind of a cheap or affordable

858
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
one gig switch.

859
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,480
We have a few that we make available, but we're continuing to improve upon that.

860
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,000
So I would say if you're doing 10 gig and 40 gig traffic, it's a great fit there from

861
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,480
a traffic perspective, and certainly on the economic side.

862
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,920
All of our pricing is transparent.

863
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,920
It's on our website.

864
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,600
It's very clear what the pricing model is.

865
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,360
It's very similar to Red Hat.

866
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,920
It's basically a license that you have to utilize the software for a year or three years

867
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,720
in different support levels.

868
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,360
We don't have any time bomb in the product, so it's not as if after a year it just stops

869
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,360
routing your packets.

870
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,640
We don't do anything like that.

871
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,640
We try not to be evil.

872
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,560
But I'd say really the third most important thing in that list is really just the philosophy.

873
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,280
So if your organization has already switched to using some automation software and has

874
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,120
strong Linux knowledge, particularly on the networking side, or that team is kind of hip

875
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,480
to that environment, it works out really well.

876
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,360
We see this a lot with customers where virtualization was seen as kind of a scare, where well, when

877
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,440
we deploy virtualization, we're going to lose all these help desk folks.

878
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,120
But really it just grew capacity for that part of the organization.

879
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
This is the same thing.

880
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,520
So a lot of times networking teams have struggled because they have to use something like Tickle

881
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,480
or XSLT or some sort of proprietary programming language that's not well adopted or just never

882
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,120
got mainstream interaction.

883
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,360
What's great about Cumulus Linux is that that knowledge that you already have in-house can

884
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,760
be immediately applied.

885
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,840
So if you've written everything in Go or CornShell or PopIt or Ansible or whatever the case may

886
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,200
be, that can now immediately apply to your network.

887
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,820
So if your networking team is very much Linux savvy, it's a great fit.

888
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:39,000
And speaking of actual in-production environments, you find a lot, every large organization,

889
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,520
they have a ton of system administrators.

890
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,120
They don't necessarily have a lot of network engineers.

891
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,640
So how does Cumulus Linux cater to that evolving market dynamic?

892
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,360
Well, that's a great question.

893
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,600
So on the sysadmin side, we've tried to be very open about the software that we support.

894
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,080
So we just announced a customer that developed actually Chef cookbooks.

895
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,160
The customer's name is Uyala.

896
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,960
And they actually published on their GitHub account cookbooks that support both Quagga

897
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,480
generation and the Excedra Network Interfaces file, which is the Debian-style file for configuring

898
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,960
both physical and logical interfaces.

899
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,320
And so that was a customer-driven adoption of a particular tool.

900
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,360
And on Cumulus itself, we've actually done development for both Puppet and Ansible for

901
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,320
modules there that you can utilize.

902
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,240
So we try to adopt the tools that system administrators are already using as much as we can.

903
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:32,800
And when you do have to make changes to a code base or when you do have to get an update,

904
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,440
is that something that stays in Cumulus or is that something that gets pushed back upstream?

905
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
Yeah.

906
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:45,920
So I would say about 99% of the software that we maintain or modify or change, we push upstream.

907
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,760
There's a website called OSS.cumulusnetworks.com, and that lists all of our patches or all of

908
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
our diffs.

909
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,680
Since we're based off of Debian, all of our diffs are against a Debian-based package.

910
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,400
So it's kind of two levels of diffs, if you will, from the original upstream code.

911
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,840
There's the Debian-style package, whatever it's changed, and then our diff against that.

912
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:10,640
So anything like Quagga, LDP, libraries, the kernel, Netlink, we've pushed that all upstream.

913
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,400
The only component that's proprietary at this time is something called SwitchD, which is

914
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,960
both kind of a driver and a user-land process that replicates any of the Netlink events

915
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,000
in the hardware.

916
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,880
So again, if you were to add a route with, say, IP space route or with Quagga or your

917
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,020
own routing protocol, it intercepts those events and pushes it down in the hardware.

918
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,680
So again, you get a performance of a traditional switch.

919
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,680
It also does other events like, say, firewalls, for example.

920
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,720
So if you write rules and IP tables syntax, we will parse those, make sure they're valid,

921
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,780
and then push it in the hardware.

922
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,340
So SwitchD is something that unfortunately is not open at this time because the code

923
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,400
it's compiled against is not GPL.

924
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
Okay.

925
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,520
Well, the bottom line is, that's one package out of the entire project.

926
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,960
I would consider you guys to be a very, very good community member, and I think that's

927
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,960
really fantastic.

928
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,200
Like I said, one of the companies that is actually using Linux and contributing to the

929
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,280
community and believes that Linux can succeed in your respective space, and I think that's

930
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
really fantastic.

931
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,080
Now, if somebody wanted to play, maybe they're not in an enterprise, they're just a home

932
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,240
user, and they just, because it's such an interesting project, they wanted to play with

933
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
it.

934
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,280
Is there a way to obtain Humulus Linux and try it and see how it works?

935
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
Yeah.

936
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,280
So today, we don't currently offer a VM that's available for customers.

937
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,320
The main difference there is that the VM is not going to represent exactly what you'd

938
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,320
get on hardware.

939
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,980
Certainly, the performance would be night and day difference.

940
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:34,120
Other things that are different, so for example, on a VM, you may not get certain telemetry

941
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,320
or environmental data like, say, SM BIOS fields, like a serial number, stuff like that.

942
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,880
So we are working on packaging a VM for the end of the year that will be available for

943
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,080
folks to trial.

944
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,920
But today, we have something called the Humulus Workbench, which basically allows prospective

945
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,820
customers to register time on an actual real environment.

946
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:55,280
So we have a number of switches in the data center that have a console server, a PDU,

947
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,520
and a management host.

948
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,820
And so that allows customers to experiment with a number of different software suites.

949
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:04,760
So we have Ansible, and CF Engine, and Puppet, all available there, and you can literally

950
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:11,340
run an apt-get command and say, okay, I want to build a two-leaf spine architecture with

951
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,200
two leaf nodes and two spines, and they're already physically cabled up, and it will

952
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,160
actually blast out all the conflicts for that and walk you through all the steps.

953
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,120
So the Humulus Workbench is available to anyone.

954
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,720
You just have to schedule time.

955
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,320
Again, we have roughly around 40 or so switches in a data center that's made available for

956
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,320
that.

957
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,320
We feel that's more representative of kind of the real-world environment.

958
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,320
That's fantastic.

959
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,680
What's the cost involved with doing that?

960
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,400
The Humulus Workbench right now is free.

961
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,760
We don't do any charge for that.

962
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,360
But typically, you always have to fill out a form and talk about what your use case is

963
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,400
and what you're planning to do.

964
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
That's fantastic.

965
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,240
Now, how about, you said that the pricing structure is very open.

966
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,880
Can I ask what a copy of Cumulus Linux costs?

967
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,880
Sure.

968
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,160
So it depends on two factors.

969
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,000
Basically, what is the dominant line share of the ports?

970
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,200
So is it a mostly one-gig switch, meaning it's got probably 48 ports of one gig and

971
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,800
a couple ports of 10 gig?

972
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,120
Or is it a 10-gig switch, or is it a 40-gig switch?

973
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:05,400
So the physical infrastructure dictates the pricing.

974
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:14,560
Also, there is either standard business support or more rapid support in terms of like a 24-7

975
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,560
coverage.

976
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,720
Roughly, it's around $5,000 when you're looking for a 10-gig switch.

977
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,000
Again, it depends on the support levels and all the pricing on the website.

978
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,280
I think the difference with us is that you're basically getting a full operating system

979
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,480
with support, by the way, for the cost of traditionally a support contract.

980
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,920
And so that's really powerful.

981
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,640
And all of our support engineers today are based out of Raleigh, and so we have a good

982
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:41,540
pool of both ex-Red Hat folks, ex-Sysco folks, and other vendors.

983
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,800
So the amount of knowledge there is pretty high.

984
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,480
So it's very common for us to respond back to a customer very promptly and say, here's

985
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,080
a Python script, or here's a one-liner, or here's a patch to solve your problem, versus

986
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,520
we have to wait to get a new build out to them.

987
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,620
That's fantastic.

988
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,880
That's really great to have that one-on-one direct connect right to the people that can

989
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,420
actually provide you the help that you need.

990
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:08,000
How much, if you know off the top of your head, would it cost to get one of the actual

991
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
switching hardware?

992
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,680
Well, again, that's really dependent on how you're acquiring hardware.

993
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,680
So if you're going to something like a CDW, or indoor micro, versus a Dell, versus kind

994
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,480
of a local mom and pop bar, the pricing can be pretty dramatic there, just as it would

995
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,880
be with a super micro server or a Dell server.

996
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,760
Typically, we'll see 10 gigabit switches, meaning that there's 40 ports of 10 gig, and

997
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,860
usually four 40 gig ports.

998
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,440
Those are all SFP and QSFP based.

999
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:37,120
Typically, we see that for about five grand US quantity one, and again, that's kind of

1000
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,800
standard MSRP pricing.

1001
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,280
So it can be dramatically cheaper, or a little bit more depending on your acquisition method

1002
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,280
of getting hardware.

1003
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,280
Right, right.

1004
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,720
Well, I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with us.

1005
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,960
If people wanted to find more about Cumulus Networks, more about Cumulus Linux, and perhaps

1006
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,080
get in contact with you and make a sale, where could people go to do that?

1007
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,080
Yeah, certainly.

1008
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,880
So cumulusnetworks.com is the website, and it has data sheets, information on how to

1009
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,480
sign up for the customer workbench, and then a contact form.

1010
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,560
You can also reach out to myself.

1011
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:13,200
It's Matt, M-A-T-T, at cumulusnetworks.com, and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

1012
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,680
That was a lot of info.

1013
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,400
Noah, did you walk away?

1014
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,240
Are you thinking about maybe deploying that for clients, or at least playing with the

1015
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,240
tech?

1016
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,240
Oh yeah, for sure.

1017
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,920
So let's, if you don't mind, I'll take a minute and go through a couple things.

1018
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,920
Sure.

1019
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,280
So one thing he left out in the interview that I thought was so interesting, and he

1020
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,360
just didn't mention it, so I didn't know if they wanted to go on camera with it or not,

1021
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,920
but I heard him mention it a couple times after that at the booth, so it doesn't seem

1022
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,920
to be private.

1023
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:42,560
But the guy that started Cumulus Networks originally worked for Cisco, and then came

1024
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,960
over to Google to help design and build a large portion of their infrastructure.

1025
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,000
So they know networking.

1026
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,080
It's not like they're beginners.

1027
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:00,760
So walking around LinuxCon, as we saw at OSCON, was people are interested in how we can make

1028
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:06,160
money off the backs of the community, not necessarily how do we improve the community,

1029
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,720
how do we improve Linux, or how do we get Linux adoption.

1030
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,700
And a lot of people really want to marginalize Linux.

1031
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,680
They want to say Linux is really only good on the server as far as anything else, embedded

1032
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,680
and server, that's good.

1033
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,760
And it's an implementation detail.

1034
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,760
Right.

1035
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,640
So, and this company is doing the exact opposite.

1036
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,480
They're saying, listen, we're doubling down.

1037
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,720
We think that Linux is actually good enough.

1038
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:30,280
Everyone wants to go towards Cisco and Juniper and HP, and really, we have all the tools

1039
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,480
we already need, and it's already backed by the community, and we're already making

1040
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:38,260
all of these developments and forward progression in the server space.

1041
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:42,320
So why not take all that information, why not take all of those trained individuals,

1042
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:46,220
and instead of paying a network engineer to manage the switches, and a network administrator

1043
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:51,040
to manage the servers, I can pay one person to manage both, or at least have, you know,

1044
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,040
people are cross trained.

1045
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,480
And just being able to take my Linux system administration skills and apply them to manage

1046
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,600
a switch, it sounds very valuable to me to repurpose that skill set.

1047
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,760
Did you get a chance at their booth to see any of the actual hardware, like did it look

1048
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,760
good?

1049
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,760
Yeah.

1050
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:12,040
Well, it's, so what it is, is it's generic, it's the, it's essentially the same piece

1051
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:16,040
of equipment that Cisco buys when they put Cisco IOS on and then painted a different

1052
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,440
color and stuff, right.

1053
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:25,120
But so the other thing too, and I think that he didn't, as far as, you know, maybe this

1054
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:30,680
is a little too technical, but when I was asking him about implementing it, essentially

1055
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:36,040
what I was getting at was, I know that their router supports like OSPF, and I know they

1056
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:40,380
do RIP and RIPv2, what I wanted to know is there's a lot of environments that are stuck

1057
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,320
on Cisco devices because they're using IGRP.

1058
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:48,280
And up until last year, IGRP was a proprietary protocol that only Cisco devices could use,

1059
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,280
but now in 2013, they actually released it as an open standard.

1060
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,600
So I was interested in seeing if, cause if that's a possibility, if that, if, if they

1061
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,840
are planning on implementing it, or if they have already implemented it, there's a huge

1062
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,960
market for people that want to jump off of Cisco hardware, but need to be able to adapt

1063
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,960
to EIGRP.

1064
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,400
And I didn't quite get that answer.

1065
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,120
I didn't get the answer I was looking for, and that's okay.

1066
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,680
And the other thing I was a little disappointed with is I was hoping that there would be like

1067
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,980
some sort of a community edition or a free edition that I could download and put it on

1068
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:24,440
to just a regular x86 box and just put two network cards in.

1069
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,800
Yeah, you can't do that?

1070
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,800
No, you can't.

1071
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,800
Unfortunately, no.

1072
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,800
Oh yeah.

1073
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,560
That would be extremely useful.

1074
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,200
So the thing is, how does, how does stuff like this get adopted?

1075
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,320
Stuff like this gets adopted because everyone starts using it or everyone starts playing

1076
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,320
with it.

1077
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,680
Or you know, a lot of times you inappropriately put something into production that you probably

1078
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,880
shouldn't and then you decide, you know what, this is worth it.

1079
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,240
Let me go ahead and just buy the commercial version or whatever.

1080
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,240
Exactly.

1081
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,440
I was kind of hoping that, that he would say something like that and he didn't, but overall,

1082
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,840
they were one of the, and I don't know if I, you know, I think it was on the other part

1083
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:57,560
of the interview, but all, except for one package, every other development or every

1084
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,240
other improvement they make, they contribute back upstream.

1085
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,720
So the Linux community is benefiting from everyone that buys one of these routers or

1086
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,720
switches.

1087
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,720
That's awesome.

1088
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,000
I mean, it's, that's, this is one of the things I love about when commercial companies get

1089
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,160
involved with Linux and they do it the right way.

1090
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,240
And I think that's what Cumulus is doing here.

1091
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,240
And one of the reasons I wanted to spend some time on this, this episode is because I think

1092
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,000
this is one of the most fascinating areas of potential growth for Linux that we could

1093
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,920
see in the next few years.

1094
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,360
And it's something that it's hard for us, unless you're deploying this kind of stuff

1095
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,080
all the time to really kind of talk about.

1096
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,720
So that was a great insight from Matt and I'd be really curious to know if you do end

1097
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,280
up playing with it, how it goes.

1098
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,280
Yeah.

1099
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,280
Interesting stuff.

1100
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,280
All right.

1101
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,840
So we, I, we got two more interviews to play.

1102
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,120
That was our longest one.

1103
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,400
I I'm looking, I haven't watched this all the way through yet cause I was saving it

1104
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,400
for the show.

1105
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,040
So I stopped by and had a chat with Frank from own cloud.

1106
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,040
We've talked to Frank before in the Linux action show.

1107
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,800
This might be Frank's first appearance on Linux unplugged.

1108
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,760
I'm really curious to see what he had to say.

1109
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:58,160
So back in the media lounge yet at Linux con 2014, I ran into Frank and of course you guys

1110
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,160
remember Frank.

1111
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,720
He's been on both the Linux action show and I believe Linux unplugged.

1112
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,720
How are you doing today, Frank?

1113
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,720
Not sure.

1114
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,720
Very good.

1115
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,720
It's a great event here.

1116
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,720
It is.

1117
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,720
It's fantastic.

1118
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,720
And it's fantastic too.

1119
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,120
Um, as I'm walking around, I'm finding more and more people that are, that are using Linux.

1120
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:16,320
Um, and of course one of the big hurdles to that is having services and products that

1121
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,320
work on Linux.

1122
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,640
And of course own cloud is right at the front of making that happen.

1123
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,640
Yeah.

1124
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,640
I mean that's, thank you.

1125
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,640
That's our goal exactly.

1126
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,840
I mean, our goal is not to provide like a service or software doing open source project.

1127
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,720
There's something esoteric, but something that's really useful for people that can run

1128
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,200
at a machine and it's really bring some value to them.

1129
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,200
Yeah.

1130
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,600
So you guys recently came out with the latest version of own cloud.

1131
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,680
So I'm still on six, but I understand there's a newer version and that there's some really

1132
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,880
compelling reasons to upgrade.

1133
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,880
That's true.

1134
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,880
Yeah.

1135
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:48,880
Yeah.

1136
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,120
We released own cloud seven, the community edition, like six weeks ago or something as

1137
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,400
a huge step forward.

1138
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:59,520
I mean in several areas, the user interface, the front end is really completely redesigned.

1139
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,160
It's a, it's a lot faster.

1140
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:05,460
I mean, you mentioned me before that the speed is, uh, could be better in six.

1141
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,800
We actually did it for seven.

1142
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,960
So seven is really significantly faster.

1143
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,040
And then we have a lot of exciting new features with server to server sharing.

1144
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,360
So if you have an own cloud server, I have an own cloud server, we can have a shared

1145
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:21,040
folder that I put something in my folder that appears on your folder, even as different

1146
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,040
machines.

1147
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,900
And then we support object store back and we support lots of polishing.

1148
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,600
And one of the, another big things I want to mention is actually the quality and the

1149
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:35,680
stability of the software really significantly improved and we closed, I don't know, hundreds

1150
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,680
of bugs.

1151
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,960
It's really, really nicely polished and faster now.

1152
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:45,440
One of the things that I have always looked for in, um, in a project and I think own cloud

1153
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,600
is the closest I've ever seen to delivering this is, you know, when I log onto the internet,

1154
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,200
one of the first places I head over is to my, like my social networking site and I click

1155
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,420
on that because it's like this hub that I can get like a dashboard view of what's going

1156
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,420
on in life.

1157
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,420
I can get news there.

1158
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,420
I get updates with my friends.

1159
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:04,600
I have the contact info, all the stuff that I want to see pictures, all that stuff comes

1160
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,600
into that hub.

1161
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,320
And one thing that I think has always been missing from computing in general is a hub

1162
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,400
for other things.

1163
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,680
So for example, like I need a hub that tells me what tasks I'm doing today and a hub that

1164
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:18,800
tells me what my calendar is and a hub that tells me where my notes are and, and messages

1165
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,980
and people send me messages.

1166
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,800
And I have been able to, cause the nice thing about own cloud is you can almost craft it

1167
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,320
to do those things.

1168
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,160
And I'm wondering, is that kind of the same vision that you guys are seeing?

1169
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:34,240
Are you looking to essentially replace things like Google services?

1170
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,000
I wouldn't say that the goal is to replace Google services because there are lots of

1171
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
them, right?

1172
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,440
And some of them are actually very good.

1173
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,720
So it's, I would say, Hey, we want to replace everything like tomorrow.

1174
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,000
That's a big task.

1175
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,600
But what we want to do is everything that actually contains sensible data for you, something

1176
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:59,400
that you consider private, your files, your emails, your calendar, your notes, something

1177
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,400
like that.

1178
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,280
So that's the mission of own cloud, that you can host it yourself, that you can protect

1179
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,280
it.

1180
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,400
If it moves more into like the social area where you have like a news feed of your friends

1181
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,480
and then it's like, I mean, then it makes more sense for centralized services.

1182
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,720
So we don't want to replace Facebook or Twitter or something, right?

1183
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:22,920
Because it's actually useful to have it in a central server because it's social, right?

1184
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:27,320
But the stuff that's actually very important for you, private has to be protected, encrypted

1185
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,680
perhaps that's own cloud, yeah.

1186
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,680
That's fantastic.

1187
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:35,520
Now I know that own cloud, one of the, one of the huge advantages is that I can, if the,

1188
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,840
if own cloud itself doesn't provide me with a functionality, I can go out, find an ad

1189
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:44,000
and put it in and I've had that, that functionality and I've noticed that over the revisions,

1190
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,460
it seems like some of those things that were previously add-ons have gotten, maybe not

1191
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:52,020
exactly in their current form, but they, they get integrated into the actual own cloud.

1192
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,000
Have we seen that from six to seven?

1193
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Yeah, partly.

1194
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,840
I mean, there are some, let me think about examples.

1195
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:05,000
I mean, the picture gallery, for example, it was relatively basic for own cloud three

1196
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,040
and four and so on.

1197
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:13,400
And there were like third party picture galleries with more nicer slideshow features and so

1198
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,760
on.

1199
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:19,940
And now the newest gallery application that's in own cloud seven actually has all the features.

1200
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:22,320
So what you say is partly true.

1201
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:27,520
And the reason for that is obviously because own cloud is a fully open community driven

1202
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,600
software.

1203
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:32,440
So everybody can contribute and we see a lot more contributors.

1204
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,060
I mean, our numbers are really, really going up.

1205
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:40,240
So a lot more people that put their stuff in, they have their ideas, submit patches,

1206
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,240
pull requests.

1207
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,440
So that's the nice thing about open source.

1208
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,400
So lots more polishing all over the place.

1209
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:52,540
Now you mentioned that as these features rise and of course your need for funding is going

1210
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:53,540
to rise.

1211
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:57,440
One of the ways I think that that could work is if own cloud was to succeed in a corporate

1212
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,440
environment.

1213
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,120
So right up until this point, we're talking about private data.

1214
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,880
But what happens if a company wanted to essentially establish their own cloud?

1215
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,160
I mean, I've actually seen firsthand that work at a couple of different places.

1216
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,240
They've rolled out own cloud and it worked very, very well in a corporate infrastructure.

1217
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,580
Is that something that you guys catered to or is that just a happenstance that happens

1218
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,580
to work out?

1219
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,580
Absolutely.

1220
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:21,800
I mean, this is the core reason why own cloud as an open source project and own cloud as

1221
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,160
a company work so well together because the requirements are actually very similar.

1222
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,360
I mean, companies want to protect their data and individuals at home want to protect their

1223
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:35,480
data and want to host it themselves and integrate it with other customization and extend it

1224
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,560
and so on.

1225
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:41,000
So the general idea is really similar and because of that, we are actually, we are able

1226
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,880
to found a company around own cloud.

1227
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,160
As you know, we have own cloud Inc startup and we sell exactly what you asked for like

1228
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,480
an enterprise optimized version of own cloud.

1229
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,360
We provide this for, sell this to companies.

1230
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,360
Yeah.

1231
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,360
Perfect.

1232
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,560
Is there anything else you'd like to tell us about own cloud, the project, or if people

1233
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,680
are interested in finding out more, is there a place they can go to find more information?

1234
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:05,680
Well, there's owncloud.org for the community site, owncloud.com for the company site.

1235
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,920
But it's actually good that you asked.

1236
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:10,440
There's one more thing I want to talk about is if you're really interested in own cloud

1237
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:16,200
and you want to contribute, want to be part of the community, then we have the very first

1238
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:22,320
own cloud developer conference coming up in Berlin, actually next week in Berlin.

1239
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,320
So you can go to owncloud.org slash conf.

1240
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:31,040
And we have already way over 100 people signed up and these are not users, right?

1241
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,720
These are the people who want to contribute, developers.

1242
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,200
So if you want to be part of this open community, just come there.

1243
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,720
It's absolutely free, of course.

1244
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:45,760
And just work with us on building the next big thing for own cloud.

1245
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,040
Man, I'll tell you what.

1246
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:52,480
I am an own cloud believer, too, as of version 7.

1247
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,480
Noah, have you played with it yet?

1248
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,240
Have you done any own cloud deployments?

1249
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,240
I know you mentioned you had a 6.

1250
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,560
Are you just experimenting or is it something you're using all the time?

1251
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,560
Yeah.

1252
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:08,520
So I put 6 to use personally and then I actually, we had a clinic that came and what they were

1253
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:12,800
asking for was it seemed like own cloud would fit and I showed them a demo.

1254
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,800
It was actually, it was funny.

1255
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,280
I was sitting in a meeting room and I'm like, usually I would have a demo set up.

1256
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,920
I had no idea you guys were looking for this, so I can show you my personal one and if you

1257
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,920
like it.

1258
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:23,920
Yeah, sure.

1259
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,920
So it was on the screen for a little bit.

1260
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,560
After 15 minutes, the CEO of the hospital said, yeah, we're going to go to this.

1261
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:32,680
Man, that makes so much sense for hospitals or companies like that.

1262
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,680
And so I got back.

1263
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:38,280
I didn't get back to Grand Forks until Friday and I had to catch up on work Saturday, Sunday

1264
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,280
and Monday.

1265
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,040
So I haven't really had a chance to do a whole lot, but I'm definitely going to upgrade my

1266
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,200
instance to 7.

1267
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,640
And of course, Frank, somebody said in the chat room, you know, Frank is a super nice

1268
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,680
guy and a great guy to talk to and somebody who's really dedicated to his projects.

1269
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,840
Yeah, I like both him and Joss a lot.

1270
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,840
They're both really great guys.

1271
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:59,060
You know, let me tell you how I've done my own cloud instance and this is really how

1272
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,240
I recommend you do it too.

1273
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,240
It's amazing.

1274
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:05,560
First, go to our sponsor, digitalocean.com and keep in mind, you can use the promo code

1275
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,920
unpluggedaugust.

1276
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,720
Keep unplugged August in the back of your mind while I tell you a little bit about this.

1277
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,800
Digitalocean.com is where I set up my droplet running Ubuntu 14.04.

1278
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,400
Then I went over to the own cloud website.

1279
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,560
I followed a extremely simple step-by-step guide.

1280
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,160
It sets up a repo for own cloud.

1281
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,560
So now I'm getting updates to my own cloud installation.

1282
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,680
I've already had one update.

1283
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,600
It went brilliantly, no problem.

1284
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,720
And I have a VPS that's on DigitalOcean right now and all it does is own cloud.

1285
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,720
And it's awesome.

1286
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,600
I went out and registered a great domain that I love for it.

1287
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,600
That's super funny.

1288
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,560
I'm going to use it for our production staff and I switched over.

1289
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:42,840
I have a test iOS 8 device and I'm going to try this on the Sailfish OS device that I

1290
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,640
have too because I noticed it also has support for CarDAV and KelDAV.

1291
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:51,600
And now all of the backend syncing infrastructure for my mobile apps is going to my own cloud

1292
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,600
instance.

1293
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,600
I'm not syncing off Google anymore.

1294
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,680
I've moved off Google on my phone and it's amazing.

1295
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,880
It really does feel incredible because I haven't lost the functionality.

1296
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,840
I'm using my DigitalOcean droplet with own cloud 7, syncing to my phones.

1297
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,840
It's amazing.

1298
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,840
And you can do it too.

1299
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:12,240
I have a local sync right here on my, in fact there's my own cloud sync client right there.

1300
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,240
I just fired up.

1301
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:17,760
It's connecting to my DigitalOcean droplet, keeping all of my desktops in sync.

1302
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,760
I love that.

1303
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,900
Who needs Dropbox?

1304
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:25,400
And that just right there, just that is worth $5 and that's not all I'm using it for.

1305
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,320
So here's a little bit about DigitalOcean.

1306
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,740
It really is a simple cloud hosting dedicated to really the most intuitive and easy way

1307
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:32,960
to spin up a cloud server.

1308
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,420
I'm getting emails from folks that are spinning up servers in under a minute all the time.

1309
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,040
But they say you'll probably get one going in about 55 seconds.

1310
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,280
And here's where it's gold.

1311
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:46,000
Pricing plans start at $5, $5.

1312
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,440
And you get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU and a terabyte of transfer connected

1313
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:56,960
to tier one bandwidth DigitalOcean as data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore,

1314
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,880
Amsterdam, and a brand new one in London.

1315
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,000
They just turned on IPv6 in another data center.

1316
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,200
They've got an announcement about that on their website.

1317
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,680
Let me tell you about their interface.

1318
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,000
It is so simple, so intuitive.

1319
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,560
The control panel, if you're watching the video version, I'm pulling it up right here.

1320
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,120
It's really what it looks like.

1321
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:16,480
You can use it and it's not just about how fast you can spin up a server.

1322
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,960
It's not just about how easy it is to make backups.

1323
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,360
It's reducing the friction so that when Rekai comes down to me and says, hey, you know,

1324
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,840
there's something I wanted to test, but I'd really like to have a fresh Linux installation

1325
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,840
to test it on.

1326
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,640
And I'd really like it to be publicly accessible.

1327
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,480
It's not no matter, it's no matter like a, well, I guess I could create a VM, open up

1328
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:38,120
a port on the firewall, forward that traffic in, set up DNS, install all the, no.

1329
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:42,120
I went over to DigitalOcean and under a minute, I had a droplet ready to go for him to use

1330
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,120
to deploy the software he needs.

1331
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:48,100
It's so easy to scale up my infrastructure just on demand as I need it, and when we're

1332
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,480
done with the project, we spin it back down.

1333
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,660
You need to add capacity for your backend for a little while, baby got back over DigitalOcean.

1334
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:58,040
Go over there, use our promo code, get the $10 credit.

1335
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:01,400
If you just need to scale for a launch for a couple of days, go over to DigitalOcean.

1336
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,360
They even have hourly pricing.

1337
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,580
Just use that promo code, Unplugged August, and here's the best part.

1338
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:09,780
If you forgot to use Unplugged August when you checked out earlier, they'll let you go

1339
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,120
back and apply it again.

1340
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,240
That's how awesome DigitalOcean is.

1341
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:16,080
DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code, Unplugged August.

1342
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:21,200
If nothing else, go play with some own cloud, own cloud and DigitalOcean, two great things

1343
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,200
that go together.

1344
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,120
You know, I was just looking at our subreddit.

1345
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:28,000
We have somebody who spun up a droplet in 20 seconds.

1346
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Unbelievable.

1347
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I believe it too.

1348
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Unbelievable.

1349
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
20 seconds.

1350
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Unbelievable.

1351
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Was that the London data center?

1352
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
That's got to be the, right?

1353
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I don't know.

1354
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,200
I've heard the London, I mean, they're all amazing, right?

1355
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,960
They're all amazing, but that London data center is just such a firecracker.

1356
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:41,960
It's really awesome.

1357
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,960
And I hope he used Unplugged August so he got a $10 credit when he did it too.

1358
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,200
All right, we got to cover the SUSE interview.

1359
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,360
So a great group over at SUSE, and of course they had a booth at LinuxCon, and they're

1360
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,080
part of the Linux Foundation, all of that, so they're in tight.

1361
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:57,520
So Noah stopped by and had a chance to talk with George and Michael.

1362
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,360
They talked about SUSEcon, which is coming up.

1363
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,360
They talked about servers.

1364
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,560
They talked about desktop, and all of it in a great chat.

1365
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,720
We're here continuing coverage of LinuxCon 2014, and we're here with George and Michael

1366
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,960
from the SUSE Project.

1367
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:09,960
How are you both doing today?

1368
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:10,960
Pretty good.

1369
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:11,960
Thank you.

1370
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:12,960
Doing great.

1371
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,960
Glad to be here.

1372
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,360
So I want to start with you, Michael.

1373
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,680
You guys both were kind enough to sit down and speak with us, and I really appreciate

1374
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:23,000
that, particularly at this conference, as I'm finding it very difficult to get people

1375
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,920
to come on camera and talk about their project.

1376
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,600
It's good to know that it says something about the openness of the SUSE Project that you

1377
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,800
guys are so willing to come on camera and talk with us, so we appreciate that.

1378
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:36,400
Now I understand there are some big changes, some big things happening with the SUSE Project.

1379
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,800
Could you tell me a little bit about that?

1380
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,640
Yeah, a couple things.

1381
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,460
We're working hard in a couple different areas.

1382
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:47,320
OpenStack, of course, we're investing quite a bit there, distributed storage.

1383
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:53,680
We've got our flagship product, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, coming out later this year.

1384
01:01:53,680 --> 01:02:00,080
We just released our SUSE Cloud OpenStack distribution based on IceHouse just recently.

1385
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:04,440
We have a live kernel patching technology that's going to come out in conjunction with

1386
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:10,040
SLEZ12, and we have a Ceph-based storage product coming out early next year.

1387
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:15,240
So we're working in all kinds of different areas to bring technologies that people are

1388
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:20,980
looking for primarily within an enterprise IT environment.

1389
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:24,920
Now when you say enterprise IT environment, are you looking more at the desktop side or

1390
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,260
the server side?

1391
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:29,800
Primarily the server side, but we have a desktop as well, of course.

1392
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:34,840
In fact, one of the other things that I wanted to talk to you about is I understand that

1393
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,520
you have a conference that you do every year.

1394
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:45,400
Yeah, we have what we call SUSECON, and that is our conference for customers and partners.

1395
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:49,560
This year that'll be in Orlando, November 17th through 21.

1396
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,280
Okay, outstanding.

1397
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:57,240
Now Michael, I understand that, am I understanding correctly, that you are on the more technical

1398
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,080
side of the SUSE?

1399
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:02,800
I'm a product marketing manager for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.

1400
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:07,200
Okay, so tell me a little bit about what it is that your position offers and what it is

1401
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,200
that you do.

1402
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:16,160
Yes, I am in charge of the messaging and positioning for the new upcoming SLEZ12, and actually

1403
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:21,160
we are going to release the official release of the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 with

1404
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:27,460
other solutions later this year.

1405
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:31,040
One important area we're going to focus is downtime.

1406
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:36,240
We are tackling this problem from many levels.

1407
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:43,440
For example, when we talk about downtime, there are different kinds of downtime, planned

1408
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,360
downtime and unplanned downtime.

1409
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:50,600
We're tackling both, for example, from the hardware side, we are collaborating with different

1410
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:56,920
hardware partners to fully exploit the RAS reliability, availability, and serviceability

1411
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,020
features in the hardware platform.

1412
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:05,480
You might take a look at the background and the chameleon sitting on top, the big IBM

1413
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,880
System Z machine.

1414
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:12,480
Actually we are the most popular Linux distribution in the IBM System Z.

1415
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:20,320
We are also including the high availability in the IBM System Z.

1416
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:27,480
No matter what platform like Intel, like IBM customer choose, SUSE Linux Enterprise is

1417
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:36,680
their safe choice to build additional level of availability and reliability into the hardware.

1418
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:44,480
Also from the service level, we are offering solutions and features like high availability

1419
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:51,000
and live kernel patching like Michael just mentioned, KGraft, to build up the service

1420
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:58,840
uptime to ensure your service is okay, like you can easily set up a high availability

1421
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:07,040
cluster or even you can set up the geoclustering to connect your two data centers in different

1422
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:12,560
locations so that in case one location goes down, the other location can back up.

1423
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:18,220
Also KGraft is a big thing, a big innovation from SUSE which allows you to do the live

1424
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,520
kernel patching.

1425
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:26,000
You don't imagine a situation where you run a mission critical workload, you cannot afford

1426
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:33,760
to shut it down, or you run a virtualization host with like 40 or even 50 virtual machines,

1427
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,600
you cannot even afford the host to go down.

1428
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:41,400
Live kernel patching is a technology for you to do the kernel patching without shutting

1429
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:47,540
down the system, a fantastic technology to boost your service uptime.

1430
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:54,220
Also we offer some other tools and services like we can allow you to do the full snapshot

1431
01:05:54,220 --> 01:06:00,400
and rollback for the full system, including kernel files so that when you do some kernel

1432
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:06,200
patching, lots of complicated interdependence of the kernel patching, you don't have to

1433
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,360
shut down.

1434
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:12,440
You can just snapshot and rollback just in case you did anything wrong by operational

1435
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,400
mistakes.

1436
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:20,060
There are many, many other things coming into the Celestial, like we have features in cloud,

1437
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:26,160
we have features in the management and interoperability and more features anticipated at the state

1438
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,160
to do.

1439
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,160
Outstanding.

1440
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:32,940
Well we look forward to hearing more about what SUSE is doing and upcoming things that

1441
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:33,940
are happening in SUSE.

1442
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:36,680
If people wanted to find more information about SUSE or if there's anything else you

1443
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:39,980
guys wanted to mention, where would people go to find that?

1444
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:44,400
So you can of course go to SUSE.com and find all kinds of information, but I also wanted

1445
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,080
to mention a couple other things.

1446
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:51,760
I want to mention our community, OpenSUSE is our community project that we sponsor and

1447
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:56,520
mentor, not mentor, but we sponsor and facilitate.

1448
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,720
OpenSUSE is a very independent community.

1449
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,360
OpenSUSE is a great community distribution.

1450
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:05,880
In fact, I run OpenSUSE as my production OS.

1451
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:11,400
So I use OpenSUSE for all the work I do at SUSE all the time and if you're looking for

1452
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:15,880
a Linux community to get involved in and you're looking for a community that's really open

1453
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:21,720
and welcoming and looking for contributors, whether it's coding, whether it's packaging,

1454
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:26,680
whether it's documentation or anything, OpenSUSE is a great community.

1455
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:33,120
So check them out, OpenSUSE.org if you're looking for a Linux community to engage with.

1456
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:38,780
Outstanding and I want to thank you and give props to you for using your own dog food so

1457
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:39,780
to speak.

1458
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:43,860
You know, in a conference like this, it's becoming a very rare thing to see somebody

1459
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:47,800
actually running Linux on their computer, which you think would be very prolific at

1460
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:53,040
a Linux convention, but actually no, it turns out that's not the case.

1461
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,040
I think that's great.

1462
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,200
That really says something about how much you guys believe in your own project that

1463
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,320
you guys are using essentially the same thing that you're selling.

1464
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:02,600
It's a great thing about the job, right?

1465
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,600
I love Linux.

1466
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,680
I've loved Linux for 15 years I've been a Linux user.

1467
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:12,800
Many of those years I had to be a Linux user at home and I had my secret Linux box under

1468
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:17,880
the desk at the office, but now Linux is what I do and I love it.

1469
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:23,360
So I run Linux at home, I run it on the office, I run it on my laptop and I get to immerse

1470
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:27,160
myself in a great community and a great operating system.

1471
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,160
Outstanding.

1472
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:31,360
Well that's the project to go to then if anyone's looking for something that they can apply

1473
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:37,840
both at home and at work and to be with a project where the people that work for it

1474
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,920
really believe in the goals and the future of Linux.

1475
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:41,920
Absolutely.

1476
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,560
Thank you all so much for taking time to speak with us, we really appreciate it.

1477
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,240
Thank you.

1478
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:52,640
So no coincidence I'm guessing, Noah, that the SUSE booth was right next to the IBM booth?

1479
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,640
No?

1480
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:58,440
Sorry, I forgot to turn on my microphone.

1481
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:03,280
So no, I don't know if this came out real clearly in the interview, but yeah, so essentially

1482
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:07,080
SUSE is what's powering that really super cool glowing blue computer.

1483
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:10,560
Hey man, it's got blue lights.

1484
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:16,960
And SUSE was extremely proud of the fact that when IBM looked for an enterprise solution,

1485
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,200
they went to SUSE.

1486
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:24,120
And IBM is going to be starting doing VPS hosting and stuff like that and for that,

1487
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:27,760
that's all getting again on the back end powered by SUSE Enterprise Linux.

1488
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:32,760
And SUSE is, they have the right model going and it's kind of the model I hope to see that

1489
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:38,240
Red Hat follow is they have SUSE for the enterprise that you can pay for and then OpenSUSE, but

1490
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,760
everyone at SUSE is actually using OpenSUSE.

1491
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:45,600
Like a little Red Hat CentOS combo there, CentOS on the desktop.

1492
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,600
Or Fedora.

1493
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,920
Or Fedora, I don't know, I feel like Fedora may work, Fedora workstation if that goes

1494
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:50,920
well.

1495
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,920
Yeah, exactly.

1496
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,560
That's right, because Fedora really isn't what OpenSUSE is in the enterprise world,

1497
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:00,040
but you know, a couple of things, this is at the conference in general, but it speaks

1498
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:03,760
to again, SUSE's dedication to this.

1499
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:07,600
So first off, a huge thank you to the Linux Foundation for having us there, for being

1500
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,600
so accommodating.

1501
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:13,080
You know, a lot of the things, a lot of the interviews and the streaming was only possible

1502
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,600
because they had to twist some arms to make that happen.

1503
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,720
So I really appreciate that.

1504
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:22,360
But you know, you walk around, there was one of the guys at the conference that I walked

1505
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:30,440
into and actually that was my favorite interview was the guy from Hastexa, Adolfo.

1506
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:33,200
He was actually, he was one of my favorite guys and I can't remember if it was him or

1507
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,920
somebody that overheard the interview and started talking to me afterwards.

1508
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,520
But he asked me a question and I didn't have an answer for him then, but I do now.

1509
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:45,960
And his question was, why is it I'm railing on everyone for purchasing MacBooks, but not

1510
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,800
all of the people that are running, that are purchasing Windows computer, aren't they both

1511
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:54,400
proprietary hardware with proprietary software coming installed?

1512
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:58,240
And again, I couldn't answer that then, but as I thought about it the rest of the conference,

1513
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:02,580
when HP, Lenovo, Dell, Acer and Gateway, when they're making computers, they're packaging

1514
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:06,440
Windows because they believe that's what's going to help them sell the machines.

1515
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:11,920
And if tomorrow users decide that they want Linux to be that operating systems, those

1516
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:16,080
manufacturers should be happy to ship with it, but Apple has a vested interest in not

1517
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,960
only selling the hardware, but getting people into their software and cloud infrastructure.

1518
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:25,560
And so the, and that's why I, so like you look at OpenSUSE as a perfect example.

1519
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:30,240
They bought ThinkPads, but they're not running Windows on them.

1520
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:35,000
And if tomorrow it became, if tomorrow IBM, this partnership grows or whatever, and all

1521
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,760
of a sudden they decide they're going to branch out and Lenovo is going to partner with them,

1522
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:43,000
they're going to, I can see Lenovo shipping SUSE on ThinkPads.

1523
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,520
I can't see Apple shipping any version of Linux on a MacBook.

1524
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,520
Never, never, never.

1525
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,520
That was my answer to that.

1526
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,520
Good point.

1527
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,520
Good point.

1528
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,520
Yeah.

1529
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,920
Well, anyway, so, so SUSE and Stexa and, and, and Cloudera were, you know, and obviously

1530
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,200
and of course Red Hat, were the ones that really stood out at the conference because

1531
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,840
they were shamelessly running Linux on everything I saw.

1532
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,760
I mean, every piece of, of hardware that they had was proudly running Linux.

1533
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,600
So would you say, was your impression of the usage of Linux similar to our takeaway from

1534
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,600
OSCON?

1535
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,600
It's pretty much all MacBooks?

1536
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,640
It was, it was better actually.

1537
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:20,320
So, so, so aside from, aside from our, aside from our, that one discussion that we had

1538
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:27,480
during the stream, most of the presenters, most of the people that were there, I'd say

1539
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:32,680
it was probably a 50-50 split between PC, well, hold on, but between PC and Mac and

1540
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:39,400
then of the 50% split of PC, a certain, you know, a sliver of them were running Linux.

1541
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,560
But there was a lot more, I didn't see, I don't think I saw a single Windows box at

1542
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,560
OSCON.

1543
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,720
I saw tons of Windows boxes at LinuxCon.

1544
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:47,720
Maybe more of the workforce?

1545
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:48,720
Yeah.

1546
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:49,720
Yeah.

1547
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:50,720
That's probably it.

1548
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:52,280
Workforce proximity to Silicon Valley.

1549
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:57,240
Well, so what you have is OSCON, you have a lot of, a lot of marketing people, like

1550
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:01,720
for instance Rackspace will only let you talk to Rackspace if you talk to one of their marketing

1551
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:02,720
or PR people.

1552
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,240
And that's who was manning the booth there.

1553
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:08,440
Whereas here, it's a lot of the people that are, you know, in the, you know, in the, in

1554
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,440
the trenches.

1555
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,440
So it's the engineers.

1556
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:14,000
Is that why, is that why you were experiencing resistance about going on camera, do you think?

1557
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Oh yeah.

1558
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Huge.

1559
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Yeah.

1560
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
In fact, so yeah, there were tons.

1561
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,360
There were, so suffice to say, there are a lot of really cool and encouraging things

1562
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:26,720
happening at big companies that you've heard of that are really, really, really pushing

1563
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,040
to support Linux.

1564
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,360
They're just not willing to go on camera and talk about it.

1565
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,200
Because they don't want to say something wrong.

1566
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,640
I don't know what it is.

1567
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:37,120
The thing is, it's one of those things where, where there, there were, there was a specific

1568
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:41,120
example where I was like, this is a huge vote for Linux.

1569
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,240
This is a huge vote, not only for Linux, but the Linux desktop.

1570
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:47,080
And the company would not go on camera and acknowledge that.

1571
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:50,000
And I'm like, I don't understand how that could possibly go wrong.

1572
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,880
That's a big name that kind of would carry a lot of weight in the community, right?

1573
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:54,880
Sure.

1574
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,880
Sure.

1575
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:00,200
But the thing is that it would single-handedly persuade me to purchase their product, having

1576
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,200
that piece of information.

1577
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,200
If I were to walk into Best Buy and I was going to buy a computer, I would say the fact

1578
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:09,760
that the company is making this decision is, it's hands down, it tells me that this hardware

1579
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,840
is likely going to work with Linux because they care about Linux and Linux specifically

1580
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,960
on the desktop.

1581
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,560
So I was, I was super disappointed and I badgered them to death to get me to talk to me.

1582
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,560
But no.

1583
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,280
Perhaps they feel strong armed by Microsoft.

1584
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,200
Yeah, that, that could be, yeah, that could be.

1585
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,960
Red Hat did eventually come on camera and talk about how they're essentially going to

1586
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:34,080
come out with a Linux desktop that's geared for, you know, for the enterprise desktop.

1587
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:38,040
So it's not just a server that we're using on a workstation, but it's actually meant

1588
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,880
for people to sit down and work at and get work done on.

1589
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:41,880
And they're going to do that.

1590
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,760
That's essentially how they're going to position CentOS.

1591
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:44,760
That's exciting.

1592
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,140
Yeah, it was.

1593
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:50,040
When you go to these things, Noah, does it make you discouraged about desktop Linux?

1594
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,040
Sometimes.

1595
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,040
Yeah.

1596
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:56,960
When I was working on, I was, I was extremely, in fact, the whole flight back I had, I can

1597
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,680
honestly say I lost sleep over it.

1598
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:03,440
And it's one of those things that I look at the world that's evolving and I'm like, man,

1599
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:08,140
we are, the Microsoft battle was bad because they were so prolific.

1600
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:11,740
But what we had going for us was at the end of the day, we had a better product.

1601
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:15,940
And what scares me about Mac is I still believe we have a better product than what, than what

1602
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:17,280
Apple offers.

1603
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:21,440
What I don't know is if other people will ever accept that or if anyone cares about

1604
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,840
the advantages that we offer.

1605
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,840
That's my thing about it.

1606
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:24,840
Yeah.

1607
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,880
Is I'm not sure about that last part.

1608
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:32,800
And I look at this too, as kind of like one of these things where we go into these events

1609
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,520
and it's kind of, it's hard not to come away with a little bit of localization bias.

1610
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:40,740
Like we might go to Ohio Fest and find it a completely different, a different scenario.

1611
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:44,980
The Linux Fests are drastically different from the conventions and I mean drastically

1612
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:45,980
different.

1613
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:49,240
I think if you show, so the email and I asked Q5 to forward it to me and he never did get

1614
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:53,520
to me, but there's an email that the guy sent out for self and the email said, projectors

1615
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:59,320
will be provided for presentations and we'll have VGA, we'll have VGA cables.

1616
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:03,200
HDMI is available, you know, if you tell, let us know ahead of time.

1617
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:07,680
If you have a freedom hating laptop that requires a special adapter, you are on your own to

1618
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:11,420
provide that adapter and use it and no troubleshooting will be provided to you.

1619
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:15,400
And I was, so that's the mentality that you get at, at, at, at Linux Fest.

1620
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,520
And I think that's what we're going to see in Ohio.

1621
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,520
Yeah.

1622
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,000
And frankly, that's where I have more fun.

1623
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Yeah.

1624
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Because that's where I fit in better.

1625
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,720
Well, here's what you're, here's what we're kind of getting to.

1626
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:28,640
This is going to be our last main topic for the day, but it's, I feel like I'm working

1627
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,080
on a bigger soapbox that I want to get onto about this, but I'm still trying to put it

1628
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,080
all together.

1629
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,600
Maybe you guys can help me coagulate it like some dirty old grease.

1630
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:41,400
Matt Assay, Matt Assay wrote a piece for Tech Republic saying, Hey, can you please shut

1631
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,960
up about the Linux desktop?

1632
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:43,960
Just shut up.

1633
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:44,960
Stop talking about it.

1634
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:45,960
All right.

1635
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:50,520
Yeah, I know Linus was at Linux Con and I know Linus said he still wants the desktop,

1636
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:51,520
but I don't.

1637
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,360
The briefest glance at market share data suggests that I'm not alone either.

1638
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,040
While hundreds of millions of people want Linux powering their smartphones and millions

1639
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:01,600
of businesses are content to let Linux run their servers, virtually no one wants to run

1640
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,280
on their laptops and desktops.

1641
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:08,040
He says Apple's been successful in part because it's reduced the complexity of personal computing,

1642
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:13,060
but even Apple has largely failed to overcome the PC's clunky interaction with human experiences.

1643
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,560
Could Linux do any better?

1644
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:15,560
Probably not.

1645
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:20,560
Linux developed historically by and for geeks may be the least likely candidate to improve

1646
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,240
the consumer experience.

1647
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:25,840
I love how he acknowledges how it's all over smartphones and devices like that, but then

1648
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:26,840
says it can't be done.

1649
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:30,560
He says, so let's move on just like the rest of the Linux world or let's just, everybody

1650
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,360
move on like the rest of the world.

1651
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:35,800
No one outside geeky events like Linux Con pines for the desktop anymore.

1652
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:40,000
We should be content that they're pining for something even better, the Android smartphone,

1653
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,200
which makes Linux desktop relevant for the next 20 years, even if it wasn't relevant

1654
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,120
for the last 20.

1655
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:50,280
So the 1990s called, they want him back.

1656
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:51,280
Yeah.

1657
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,480
I mean, God, where do I begin poking holes in this?

1658
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,080
It's like, it's just so full of misinformation.

1659
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:59,720
And also like, hello, did you know there's countries outside the United States like India

1660
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,680
and China that are seeing incredible adoption of Linux right now?

1661
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:03,680
Yeah.

1662
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,360
But that doesn't count because it's not in his living room.

1663
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,360
That's what matters.

1664
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,360
Yeah.

1665
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,360
How about Nevada?

1666
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,360
Geez.

1667
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,360
Yeah.

1668
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:13,480
I find this so, I've been finding more and more of this like, Oh, everybody just give

1669
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,480
up already.

1670
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,480
The Mac is one.

1671
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,280
The windows, windows is, windows is, this is the new narrative.

1672
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,320
Windows is fading.

1673
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,200
The Mac is escalating.

1674
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,200
Linux never won.

1675
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:26,440
And I think it's so, when I hear people say this, it sounds so self-centered.

1676
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:30,480
It's like there, it's impossible for them to consider that the year of the Linux desktop

1677
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:35,160
is not like this grand year where everything, all of a sudden everything switches.

1678
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:38,580
It's more like, well, this is the year it was good enough for me to switch over.

1679
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,360
That might be 2016 for one person.

1680
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:45,040
It might've been 20 or it might be 2002 for another person.

1681
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,040
Right?

1682
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,040
I mean, who knows, right?

1683
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:50,080
Year of the Linux desktop is whatever year you switch over.

1684
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,080
Yeah.

1685
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,080
Yeah.

1686
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,080
Go ahead.

1687
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,080
Sorry.

1688
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,080
Go ahead.

1689
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,280
I was going to, I was going to say that one of the, you know, one of the other things

1690
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:59,560
that, that one of the things that is truly encouraging, cause I've started, I used to

1691
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,880
be, I used to be afraid of asking this because I didn't want to offend people and I didn't

1692
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,680
want to step on toes, but I asked basically everyone I interviewed, I'm like, do you use

1693
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:06,680
Linux on the desktop?

1694
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:09,000
And if so, why or why not?

1695
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,760
And one of the things that was really encouraging is you find a lot of people that are leave,

1696
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,120
that leave Mac or Windows to come to Linux.

1697
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:19,600
I haven't talked to a whole lot of people, you know, obviously this is a bad segment

1698
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,600
to bring that up.

1699
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:24,160
And after this guy wrote in at the beginning of the show, but there's not a ton of people

1700
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,080
that are jumping off of Linux to go to Mac.

1701
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,480
At least not that I've talked to.

1702
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,480
Not anymore.

1703
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:31,640
I mean, I think there was a big exodus originally, VR Mac, I want to give you a chance.

1704
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:35,280
You think it comes down to education, right?

1705
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,720
Not only education in the classrooms where they're taught to use windows because it's

1706
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:39,720
the thing to have.

1707
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:44,400
But because, you know, as we frequently bring up in this show and our other shows, we really

1708
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:48,320
don't have one big company to really shout out our name.

1709
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:54,040
You know, our best chances, you know, may be canonical, but they don't care about really,

1710
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:56,880
really mass marketing because their big thing is, you know, phones now.

1711
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,420
I think this is the other, I think this is the other logical fallacy that we fall into

1712
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,600
and why we see gloom and doom.

1713
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:06,840
Because essentially the line of thought that you just iterated perfectly is this kind

1714
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:11,760
of, this kind of we take the current state of the world and we project it 10 years down

1715
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,720
the road and we say, well, this is never going to work.

1716
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,840
But if you would, if you would have gone back five years ago, you wouldn't have seen the

1717
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,920
success of Chromebooks.

1718
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,360
The idea sounds stupid.

1719
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,840
The idea of a web browser powered laptop is stupid.

1720
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:22,900
The price is stupid.

1721
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:23,900
The hardware sucks.

1722
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:25,840
And yet they're incredibly successful.

1723
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:29,320
And now after years of iteration, they're going to be respectable devices with actual

1724
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:30,680
use case scenarios.

1725
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,040
And now it's a huge growth for Linux.

1726
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,120
We never would have called that.

1727
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,640
Like there, we have no idea what's coming.

1728
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:40,560
We have no idea who's going to take Linux and package it up and make it presentable.

1729
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,240
It doesn't have to be the current form.

1730
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:46,280
I hope the current form exists for people like us forever.

1731
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:49,800
I want to be able to just run my own cobbled together version of the general technology

1732
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:50,800
platform.

1733
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,200
That's what I think Linux is.

1734
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,200
And I hope that that continues.

1735
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,200
I think it always will.

1736
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,800
I don't think that'll be the number one desktop.

1737
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,040
I don't think that's likely.

1738
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:01,480
I don't think that's even maybe necessary, like what we want to happen.

1739
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:02,800
I think we want a product to do it.

1740
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:03,800
I think we want something with support.

1741
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,880
Well, even OS X is the number one desktop.

1742
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,800
Oh, you're totally right.

1743
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:13,080
I mean, the thing is, it's really just the desktop though.

1744
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,280
It's the lack of advertisement, really.

1745
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,280
I'm not saying that.

1746
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:19,280
I'm not by any means trying to predict the future at all.

1747
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:23,860
But you can't blame that it's by geeks for geeks.

1748
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:28,560
Because the reason that it exists in the other environments is because there are people like

1749
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,160
us who care about having a better system.

1750
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:33,480
If I'm going to build a server, I know that GNU plus Linux is better.

1751
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:37,020
So of course, I'm going to put maybe Red Hat or whatever on it.

1752
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:38,960
But for the desktop, it's just not marketed.

1753
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,640
Well, and it's impossible to market, really.

1754
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:45,360
I mean, because it's like, OK, yeah, here's a platform that you can do whatever the hell

1755
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,520
you want with it.

1756
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:50,800
It can totally adapt to whatever your needs are, almost, except for video editing.

1757
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:56,160
But you know, I mean, that's simple to come across in terms of capturing a headline or

1758
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,880
some sort of snappy advertising copy.

1759
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:03,200
But you know, the best marketing it gets is word of mouth from people like me and you.

1760
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,040
Daredevilin proposes we don't need to market at all.

1761
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,040
Go ahead, Daredevilin.

1762
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:12,760
Yeah, the reason I say this is because Linux has been successful in so many places, and

1763
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:14,760
it's just natural progression.

1764
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:20,920
Yes, companies that want to take tackle, like Canonical, they should go and market their

1765
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:22,360
distribution.

1766
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:27,000
But the consumption of Linux on the desktop doesn't need, in my perspective, market as

1767
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
it needed.

1768
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:34,880
First of all, people already know how to use basic computing, which was something big in

1769
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,840
the past and required a lot of marketing to get attention.

1770
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,640
Just that was entry, barrier entry.

1771
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:40,640
Yeah, exactly.

1772
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:46,160
And the other part is, just look, if it works for your government, how hard is it for people

1773
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:47,880
to tackle that it works for them?

1774
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:52,080
I mean, once they start using these government tools, and the governments are switching because

1775
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:56,280
of the multiple reasons we know, it's just natural progression.

1776
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:04,200
And I look at it this way too, like eventually it's going to be so damn good that it would

1777
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:08,240
almost be crazy for somebody not to make it into a product.

1778
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:12,000
Once system D is no longer a new thing, and it's well integrated and fully functional,

1779
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
and everything that it's going to gobble up is gobbled, it's been nommed, once Wayland

1780
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,240
is ironed out and we have excellent drivers from the vendors, and we don't have these

1781
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:23,240
nightmare problems anymore, and a lot of our underlying technologies that we use for the

1782
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:27,840
applications like QT and GTK3 have really gotten to this excellent maturity point, which

1783
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,080
they pretty much are now.

1784
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:35,280
It would be almost financially and fiscally irresponsible for some company to not come

1785
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:39,160
along and turn that into some sort of amazing product, because there's so much incredible

1786
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:42,840
underlying technology there that's already made for them.

1787
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:45,460
It's like having a car that's pre-built that all you have to do is slap paint on and sell

1788
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:46,460
it for $10,000.

1789
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:47,460
Exactly.

1790
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:53,640
I'm very optimistic, because it's a good platform, and one of the reasons I played that crazy

1791
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:58,680
long interview with the Cumulus Network guys is because that just is one more area where

1792
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:01,040
running Linux will become the norm.

1793
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:05,480
When you have more things like on mobile, and on networking, and on servers, and cloud,

1794
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:10,760
and Chromebooks, and mobile devices, and all of these things, it would almost be crazy

1795
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:11,800
not to do it.

1796
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:15,020
Not to have it as the underlying technology for desktops, too, because it'll just be the

1797
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:17,640
underlying general purpose operating system for technology.

1798
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:20,640
Well, it's one of those things where you can literally mold it to be whatever you make

1799
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:21,640
it.

1800
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,640
Yep.

1801
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:23,640
It's exciting.

1802
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:24,640
That's the whole thing, though.

1803
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:25,640
Go ahead.

1804
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:30,280
Oh, well, that's what I'm saying, though, because it can become whatever it is you want

1805
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:33,280
to be.

1806
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:37,680
For me, the biggest thing, though, I've been using Linux since Mandrake.

1807
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:38,680
I'm not kidding.

1808
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:43,800
That was when I had to get my mom to write a check to have 78 CDs sent to me through

1809
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:44,800
the mail.

1810
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:50,360
When I came back to Linux six or seven years ago, I was like, oh, my God, it's what we

1811
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:51,360
always wanted it to be.

1812
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:52,360
Right, right, right.

1813
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:55,600
I think it'll only get better, and better, and better, and better, and better.

1814
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,920
That is the other thing.

1815
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:03,000
When I look back at old Linux action shows, and I look at what we were talking about,

1816
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,200
I go, oh, wow, we have really come a long ways.

1817
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,200
For reals.

1818
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,200
For reals.

1819
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:14,320
I think you hit the nail on the head on Sunday when you said Linux has another 30 or 40 years

1820
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,320
into it.

1821
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:16,320
Mac OS doesn't have that.

1822
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,320
Windows doesn't have that.

1823
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:20,440
When you think about that, if you think of those, especially in the current iteration,

1824
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,640
being around for that long, I don't know.

1825
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:23,640
Yeah.

1826
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:24,640
That was Greg Crow Hartman that said that, wasn't it?

1827
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:25,640
Yeah.

1828
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:26,640
He said 30 to 50 years.

1829
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:27,640
Yeah.

1830
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:28,640
30 to 50 years.

1831
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:29,640
Yeah.

1832
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:30,640
Interesting.

1833
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:31,640
There you go.

1834
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,920
For me, the breakdown comes down to this.

1835
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:37,000
I think everybody loses sight of this, at least everyone I've ever talked to.

1836
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,320
First of all, we've got a bunch of engineers trying to market stuff.

1837
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,160
That's half our problem right there.

1838
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:45,160
On top of it, it comes down to availability and support.

1839
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:48,760
Google's the closest thing thus far to have really nailed that, is that they've got the

1840
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:52,520
support and they've got the whole availability thing down because you can go to Amazon and

1841
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,240
you can buy these things.

1842
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:59,520
Until that happens, it's going to continue to be the AM way of operating systems.

1843
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,520
It really will be.

1844
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,520
That's sad, but it's true.

1845
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,720
Well, I think it's a current stage of it.

1846
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:08,980
I think it's Google demonstrating that there is a market applicability here that other

1847
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:11,240
companies will eventually start to rip off.

1848
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:12,240
That would be awesome.

1849
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,480
When they do that, they're going to want to differentiate from the Chromebook and they'll

1850
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:17,120
probably differentiate by adding more features and more capabilities.

1851
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:18,120
Exactly.

1852
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,120
That's the thing about freedom.

1853
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:22,800
Once you get a taste, it's very difficult to go back.

1854
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:28,000
All we really need is for a company like HP to take a bunch of their money and a bunch

1855
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,840
of their time and a bunch of their resources and throw it at these $200 Windows netbooks

1856
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:36,240
that aren't going to do very well, and then they'll bail on that and say, you know what?

1857
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:39,120
Let's try the same approach, but let's try a more functional Linux environment.

1858
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:42,920
Maybe let's work with the Mozilla Foundation and have Firefox launch full screen or something.

1859
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:46,800
We'll have our own version of it, and it'll be like this full Linux operating system because

1860
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,640
maybe they want to have a little more enterprise capability.

1861
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:53,560
It sounds crazy at first, but it only takes a couple of things to fall into place and

1862
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:54,880
all of a sudden HP's doing that.

1863
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,040
To Noah's point earlier.

1864
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:01,440
And imagine what happens when Red Hat comes out and says, okay, now we've perfected it.

1865
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,420
Now we have a desktop that's more stable than Windows.

1866
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:08,040
It runs a browser, which is basically more and more businesses are moving towards web-based

1867
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:09,200
software every day.

1868
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:14,640
And now HP comes out and says, okay, we'll ship that for $200, and now you have the makings

1869
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:17,120
and a company sits down at the budget and they go, well, we could buy this computer

1870
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,120
with Windows 7.

1871
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:21,680
It'll be outdated in two years or three years or whatever.

1872
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:26,480
We buy this computer from HP and essentially all it really needs to run is a web browser

1873
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:30,800
and it's immune from viruses, immune from spyware and malware, and hopefully Matt doesn't

1874
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,280
bite my head off for saying that.

1875
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:36,840
I actually have a personal anecdote about something like that.

1876
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:41,200
I worked for a company where I did basically all of my work, actually I worked for a couple

1877
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:43,880
companies like this, all of my work inside a web browser.

1878
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:47,480
I did all of my work inside a web browser and we got a virus once.

1879
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:52,120
And we were using Windows 7, we got a virus, and I'm like, this whole thing could have

1880
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:55,020
been prevented if we were just running Linux.

1881
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,280
Don't even need anything else.

1882
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,280
Exactly.

1883
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:00,740
And not only that, but it would run faster, we wouldn't have to worry about our server

1884
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:05,000
crashing as often, because that happened quite a bit.

1885
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:10,280
It was a nightmare as far as the implementation went, but our IT costs were skyrocketed because

1886
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:17,320
of not only licenses, but because the support people just were flaking off doing their

1887
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:18,320
own thing sometimes.

1888
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,320
Yeah, yeah.

1889
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:22,000
And then you end up with a revolving door of IT support, which also adds to the problem.

1890
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,000
It was awful.

1891
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,640
We had somebody there at least once a day for two weeks.

1892
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:26,640
I'm not kidding.

1893
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,840
Alright, so that's probably where we'll wrap it up.

1894
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:32,020
We'll do the retrospective in the post show, so if you're on the live stream, stick around.

1895
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:35,120
We'll look back at Linux from a few years back, but we should probably run, that'll

1896
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,160
bring us to the end of today's show, because there's a lot of show, a lot of interviews,

1897
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,840
a lot of stuff to cover.

1898
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,880
We've got a really special guest lined up for Sunday if all works out, and if not, I've

1899
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,840
got a great segment planned as a backup.

1900
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,240
So either way, we're going to have a rocking show on Sunday, Matt, alright?

1901
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,360
So have a great rest of your week.

1902
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,360
I'll see you on Sunday.

1903
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,360
See you then.

1904
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,560
Alright, and Eric, thanks for joining us in studio today, buddy.

1905
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:54,560
Well, thank you.

1906
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:55,560
I'm glad to be here.

1907
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:00,960
It was fun, and it's good to throw things back and forth, and huge, huge, huge thank

1908
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,920
you to Noah for all of his hard work out at LinuxCon.

1909
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:07,880
I know he had to double down and hustle like a mo, and so I really appreciate him going

1910
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:10,080
out there and putting everything on hold and all of that.

1911
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,080
No, you did an awesome job.

1912
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,080
It was great coverage.

1913
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,080
Alright, everyone.

1914
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:14,080
Amazing job.

1915
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,080
Thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1916
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:18,000
If we don't see you on Tuesday, maybe we'll catch you for last on Sunday.

1917
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:33,440
Goodbye, everybody.

1918
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:52,080
See you on Sunday.

1919
01:29:52,080 --> 01:30:10,560
So like 10 years ago, before I ran Ubuntu, I used Debian on my Pentium 500 MHz Dell laptop,

1920
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:15,160
and I went out to Palo Alto to do some work in an office, and I'd never worked in America

1921
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,160
before.

1922
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:23,880
I sat in a little cubicle on my own, and this guy came over, the office guy, and said, look,

1923
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:29,240
before you can plug your laptop into the network, I need you to tell me what antivirus software

1924
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,240
you use on your laptop.

1925
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:31,240
Yep, I've had that, too.

1926
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:39,760
And I said, well, I run Linux, and he went, oh, fine, and he could get an APS, and that

1927
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:40,760
was great.

1928
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:44,320
That was a great experience, but then everyone in the cubicles around me ran Windows, and

1929
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,600
that happened to be the week.

1930
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:51,480
I think it was something like Slammer or some Windows virus was doing the rounds, and everyone

1931
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:53,880
around me, their PC had been completely taken out.

1932
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:56,560
I was able to carry on working.

1933
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:57,880
Everyone around me was wiped out.

1934
01:30:57,880 --> 01:31:01,820
They all went to play golf, so there are downsides to this as well.

1935
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:02,820
That's true.

1936
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:06,520
I had to sit there and carry on working while everyone else just pissed off and had fun.

1937
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:12,440
So there was a bug in Windows 2000, before even any of the major service packs had come

1938
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:18,960
out in IIS, where if you had a certain type of query to an IIS server, it would crash

1939
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:23,640
the IIS process, and then it would get into this loop where it would start to restart,

1940
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:28,000
eat up all the CPU, and essentially the box would stop file sharing, stop print sharing,

1941
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,360
and all this kind of stuff.

1942
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:33,120
And it took the network guy a little while, because that was his box, and I had set up

1943
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,440
a Samba server.

1944
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:35,440
And so guess what?

1945
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:37,960
They decided, move everything over to the Samba server.

1946
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:38,960
That's Chris's job.

1947
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:39,960
So Windows box.

1948
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:41,600
So then Chris had all the work to do.

1949
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,920
I had to do a big migration overnight, because the Linux box was working, and I was like,

1950
01:31:44,920 --> 01:32:11,920
no, go figure.
