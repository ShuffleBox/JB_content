00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
Here's a new product category, APC, you know, creators of UPSs.

00:05.280 --> 00:08.120
They're generally a little higher market priced.

00:08.120 --> 00:15.440
I was looking for something to just power my modem and my firewall, and I came across

00:15.440 --> 00:22.240
this APC Backup Connect, and it's $47 on Amazon.

00:22.240 --> 00:28.280
But here's the crazy thing, straight up, straight up, straight up, it has major, major limitations.

00:28.280 --> 00:31.200
Like it only has two AC outlets on it.

00:31.200 --> 00:35.960
It's designed to just be a tiny battery for lower end appliances, which was exactly what

00:35.960 --> 00:36.960
I needed.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.520
But look at this, Beard.

00:38.520 --> 00:41.220
You see this, you see that battery section there?

00:41.220 --> 00:42.560
That's removable.

00:42.560 --> 00:48.680
So the UPS battery, which has a charge indicator and two USB ports on it, slides out.

00:48.680 --> 00:53.680
So you can actually, you can pull the battery out of the UPS and use it as a portable charger

00:53.680 --> 00:59.440
for your devices, which is kind of neat.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.240
And you can buy a spare one.

01:01.240 --> 01:02.240
That's true, too.

01:02.240 --> 01:03.840
Yeah, you can buy modular ones.

01:03.840 --> 01:04.840
Yeah, that's another nice feature.

01:04.840 --> 01:05.840
Oh yeah, hot swap mode.

01:05.840 --> 01:06.840
Yeah.

01:06.840 --> 01:07.840
Yeah.

01:07.840 --> 01:08.840
Shit's busy.

01:08.840 --> 01:18.000
You get a lot of messages, that sucks, and you run out of battery power right when you're

01:18.000 --> 01:20.640
on the train looking at porn.

01:20.640 --> 01:24.180
That's where APC's PowerGo comes in.

01:24.180 --> 01:28.320
Don't forget to get the tickets and that client meeting, then grab your coffee, stop looking

01:28.320 --> 01:33.960
at porn, grab your extra battery, because Android has horrible battery life.

01:33.960 --> 01:34.960
What?

01:34.960 --> 01:35.960
We can't say that?

01:35.960 --> 01:36.960
Oh.

01:36.960 --> 01:45.120
Thankfully, your APC portable power still runs even when you're out of power, getting

01:45.120 --> 01:48.360
your most important network gadgets online.

01:48.360 --> 01:57.480
Network and internet, still online even though your computer doesn't have any goddamn power.

01:57.480 --> 02:03.360
Never disconnect, not even for a damn moment, with APC's portable power.

02:03.360 --> 02:09.860
You'll never get a moment's rest, APC.

02:09.860 --> 02:27.000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 209 for August 8, 2017.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.960
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that I think is trying all of the

02:30.960 --> 02:31.960
IPAs.

02:31.960 --> 02:32.960
My name is Chris.

02:32.960 --> 02:33.960
My name is Wes.

02:33.960 --> 02:36.280
Hello, Wes, and hello, Mr. Beard.

02:36.280 --> 02:37.280
Beard joins us again.

02:37.280 --> 02:38.280
Good to have you guys.

02:38.280 --> 02:42.360
Now, we have quite a show, quite a show.

02:42.360 --> 02:45.960
So today is the conclusion of the Slackware challenge.

02:45.960 --> 02:50.760
We'll be giving you my results and Wes's results after running Slackware for the week.

02:50.760 --> 02:55.480
We're going to talk about Red Hat's more official plans without ButterFS.

02:55.480 --> 03:00.000
The new Firefox is so damn fast, we got to talk about Firefox again.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Plus, we got a meetup to announce.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.200
Friend of the show has some new code he's pushing out there.

03:06.200 --> 03:10.200
Things like GTK4 might be sooner than we expected.

03:10.200 --> 03:14.320
Of course, there's a lot of community news and updates, and we're going to talk about

03:14.320 --> 03:18.760
a new tool, something that is built right into your Linux.

03:18.760 --> 03:24.760
It just needs a little wrapper, and it is some damn fine security.

03:24.760 --> 03:25.760
We'll talk about it.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.200
We'll talk about it coming up in a little bit.

03:27.200 --> 03:33.820
And then, of course, of course, towards the end, we'll get into some also Slackware alternatives

03:33.820 --> 03:37.880
that are based on Slackware, that if you want to dip your toe in the waters, but you're

03:37.880 --> 03:41.280
not sure you're quite ready yet, you're not sure, you're not sure if you're ready to be

03:41.280 --> 03:45.080
a full slacker, there might be a couple of options out there for you.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.080
How about all that, right?

03:46.080 --> 03:47.080
That's exciting, yeah.

03:47.080 --> 03:50.360
We got a big show this week, lots of stuff, so we can't go any further without bringing

03:50.360 --> 03:51.900
in that mumble room.

03:51.900 --> 03:53.640
Time appropriate greetings, virtual dog.

03:53.640 --> 03:54.640
Pip pip.

03:54.640 --> 03:55.640
Hello.

03:55.640 --> 03:56.640
Hello.

03:56.640 --> 03:57.640
Hello.

03:57.640 --> 03:58.640
Hello.

03:58.640 --> 03:59.640
Cheerio.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.640
Good day to you.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.640
Man, Pippi is Pippi.

04:01.640 --> 04:06.160
Pippi with the pip pip is on the money, like, you know, latency be damned.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.760
He is primed and ready to go.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.320
It's always nice to see all of you guys in there.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.320
Impressive.

04:10.320 --> 04:11.320
Yeah.

04:11.320 --> 04:12.320
Hello, everybody.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.320
Thank you guys for joining us.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.760
So this is our Slackware episode.

04:14.760 --> 04:20.800
After all of the years, literally 20 of them plus, me skirting around ever trying out Slackware,

04:20.800 --> 04:21.880
it finally happened.

04:21.880 --> 04:22.880
It's a milestone.

04:22.880 --> 04:26.240
Mostly thanks to you bastards, really, for calling me out of that episode where I wasn't

04:26.240 --> 04:27.240
here.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.400
And so I figured I had to try.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.400
It's all right.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.880
I'm just talking up the next distro.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.360
Oh, I like this.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.560
Oh, you guys.

04:34.560 --> 04:37.600
So I thought before we go any further, we got to start this episode with some proper

04:37.600 --> 04:44.680
hate and cover one central repository for all of your anti-System D needs from distros

04:44.680 --> 04:46.720
to articles.

04:46.720 --> 04:53.900
That's right, everybody, without-systemd.org, a Wiki for all your resources on life without

04:53.900 --> 04:59.280
System D. And of course, the most poignant arguments against System D, like the fact

04:59.280 --> 05:07.000
that it has broken promises, it's a bit immature, it has scope creep, it has absurd bugs, it

05:07.000 --> 05:12.100
has poor design, and it's ignorance of fundamental operating system concepts.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.400
None of those are opinions, of course.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.400
None of those.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.160
I'm surprised they don't have the Leonard dictatorship on there.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.160
Yeah.

05:18.160 --> 05:21.640
Well, I think that might be implied with the poor design and ignorance, like that's sort

05:21.640 --> 05:23.120
of poking at Leonard, isn't it?

05:23.120 --> 05:25.120
It's a little bit, ouch.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.120
Yeah.

05:26.120 --> 05:31.280
So then they have a bunch of external links to like modern init system designs, all of

05:31.280 --> 05:39.320
the GNU slash Linux distributions that run without System D. And good god, good god.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.960
Now, some of these might be running without System D simply because they haven't been

05:42.960 --> 05:45.720
updated since System D was announced.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.160
But some of these are...

05:47.160 --> 05:48.960
Yeah, what stands out to you?

05:48.960 --> 05:49.960
Well, Slackware.

05:49.960 --> 05:50.960
Mm-hmm.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.640
Slackware definitely stands out to me as one that, you know, I mean, everybody knew it.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.400
Of course, Gentoo's still on the list.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.460
Everybody knows that one too.

05:56.460 --> 06:02.280
Other than that, ArchBang, I guess ArchBang was the other one that kind of surprised me,

06:02.280 --> 06:05.560
and Chromium OS, which is still rocking upstart.

06:05.560 --> 06:06.960
Still rocking upstart lives on.

06:06.960 --> 06:07.960
That's too bad for them.

06:07.960 --> 06:08.960
Wow.

06:08.960 --> 06:09.960
Wow.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.120
Why you gotta be so judgy?

06:11.120 --> 06:13.080
Maybe it works great for them, Wes.

06:13.080 --> 06:15.200
Maybe it's a real good, solid piece of code for them.

06:15.200 --> 06:18.480
Well, when you don't have to run any local software, you probably don't need System D.

06:18.480 --> 06:19.480
Yeah, maybe so.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.000
Chromium OS is based on Gentoo anyway, so.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Yeah.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Yeah, that's right.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.040
And they also cover some of the BSDs, which would be, surprise, surprise, all of them.

06:30.040 --> 06:33.800
I like that they have like a set, as if there's BSDs that do use System D.

06:33.800 --> 06:36.640
No one's managed to port System D over just to bother people yet?

06:36.640 --> 06:38.120
No, they're still working on their own replacement.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.120
Because that seems like the ultimate troll activity.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.120
System BSD.

06:40.120 --> 06:41.120
Give them time.

06:41.120 --> 06:42.120
Give them time.

06:42.120 --> 06:43.120
It'll come.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.120
It will come.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.560
So I just thought that'd be a good way to start our Slackware episode out with the definitive

06:46.560 --> 06:50.100
resource on System D. I like their logo too.

06:50.100 --> 06:51.280
It's real innovative.

06:51.280 --> 06:57.080
They've taken System D, and maybe my favorite thing about it, and I wouldn't normally call

06:57.080 --> 07:02.000
this criticism out because, you know, who am I to say, but when you look at their logo

07:02.000 --> 07:03.320
there, see if I can, can I zoom in a little bit?

07:03.320 --> 07:04.320
Yeah, there we go.

07:04.320 --> 07:05.320
Boom.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.320
Look at that.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.320
I have action zooming right here.

07:07.320 --> 07:08.320
Zoomed and enhanced.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.360
I like the circle around the circle.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.880
Yeah, there is the circle around the circle.

07:12.880 --> 07:16.360
They obviously just took a circle and a line clip art and they grabbed it from somewhere

07:16.360 --> 07:18.680
else because you can see like it's been cut out.

07:18.680 --> 07:23.880
Did something else jump out at you about their logo that maybe is a little incorrect?

07:23.880 --> 07:25.000
The S is capitalized.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
That's right.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.680
Now, I normally wouldn't mention this, but if your entire purpose as a project or a site

07:32.680 --> 07:38.600
is to be so super informed on System D that you are trying to educate the world not to

07:38.600 --> 07:45.400
use it because you know more than they do, wouldn't you know how to write it?

07:45.400 --> 07:47.000
Too busy hating it.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.360
Is that a dumb thing to like, but that just really weirds me out, the fact that they're

07:49.360 --> 07:52.080
so obsessed with this, but yet they can't get that detail right.

07:52.080 --> 07:56.920
Depending on how they did it, if that no symbol is an image and the System D under is text,

07:56.920 --> 07:58.600
the Wiki might've auto-capitalized it.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.600
No, it's all image.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.880
It's all one image.

08:00.880 --> 08:01.880
It's a little JPEG.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.840
Maybe they're doing it as like a, you know, as like a slam.

08:04.840 --> 08:05.840
Yeah.

08:05.840 --> 08:06.840
Cause you know what?

08:06.840 --> 08:07.840
They do it throughout the, well, they don't do it.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.660
So they do it in any of the title sections.

08:09.660 --> 08:10.660
That's where they do it.

08:10.660 --> 08:11.660
There too.

08:11.660 --> 08:12.660
See, that's why I said it might be the Wiki.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.660
That's probably automated.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.660
Yeah, that part would be.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.660
Yeah.

08:15.660 --> 08:16.660
Yeah.

08:16.660 --> 08:19.280
I think we mentioned the blink tag also, cause that's fun.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.280
That is good.

08:20.280 --> 08:21.280
Although it's not blinking.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.280
Yeah.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.280
Cause it doesn't really work anymore.

08:23.280 --> 08:27.200
No, but they do have a blink tag up at the top, which is solid on the top of a Wiki page.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.400
Kind of fitting in a way.

08:29.400 --> 08:33.240
Last week there was a story that we weren't really going to talk about, but like it kept

08:33.240 --> 08:34.400
coming up in the chat room.

08:34.400 --> 08:35.400
So we ended up talking about it.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.400
You remember the ButterFS story?

08:36.400 --> 08:37.400
Oh yeah.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.400
Yeah.

08:38.400 --> 08:42.320
It was announced last week that Red Hat is officially deprecating, I guess Red Hat and

08:42.320 --> 08:46.760
Red Hat is officially deprecating ButterFS and Red Hat has clarified their position on

08:46.760 --> 08:49.480
that since the last episode.

08:49.480 --> 08:54.640
Michael over at Ferronix is writing that it is going to be deprecated in all future versions

08:54.640 --> 08:57.040
of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

08:57.040 --> 09:00.720
And so you might be wondering, what are they going to do in its place?

09:00.720 --> 09:03.960
Red Hat says, no, we're not looking at ZFS.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.740
They say, yeah, people probably want ZFS, but that's not something that we're going

09:07.740 --> 09:08.740
to do.

09:08.740 --> 09:09.740
And I don't really know.

09:09.740 --> 09:16.120
I wish they could really come out and really just sort of simply iterate, or not iterate,

09:16.120 --> 09:21.200
but simply outline, I suppose, on what the blockers are for ZFS because it just would

09:21.200 --> 09:23.400
clear people's minds up on the subject.

09:23.400 --> 09:24.400
It's got to be the lizenings.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.400
Oh yeah, clearly.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.400
The doors.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.400
Clearly.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.240
But it would be really interesting to know why one company believes that it's not a problem

09:30.240 --> 09:31.240
and the other company does.

09:31.240 --> 09:34.120
I would just love to know the answer behind that.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.400
I love feeling Red Hat's just being conservative.

09:36.400 --> 09:40.200
Yeah, or maybe they have to follow different rules because they're predominantly a U.S.-based

09:40.200 --> 09:41.200
company.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.200
Something like that.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.840
And maybe they haven't seen a real ask from their clients.

09:43.840 --> 09:44.840
I don't know.

09:44.840 --> 09:45.840
I doubt that.

09:45.840 --> 09:46.840
See, that's where I...

09:46.840 --> 09:51.380
See, because I think a lot of the enterprise people who haven't dabbled in the enlightened

09:51.380 --> 09:55.600
parts of the file system world, they have SANS and other technologies they're already

09:55.600 --> 09:56.600
using.

09:56.600 --> 09:57.600
Yeah, and they don't care.

09:57.600 --> 10:01.040
So I see a lot of benefits for even just root file systems, or any time you need snapshots,

10:01.040 --> 10:02.040
et cetera.

10:02.040 --> 10:05.800
But I'm not sure that that's a really large opinion in old school enterprise Linux.

10:05.800 --> 10:10.680
One of the things that sort of informs my opinion on the back end is just watching the

10:10.680 --> 10:15.640
sales explosion for IX systems for all of their ZFS-based storage appliances.

10:15.640 --> 10:18.820
People are coming to them and saying, build me this around ZFS.

10:18.820 --> 10:23.800
They have people coming to their doors because IX is a go-to ZFS company.

10:23.800 --> 10:24.800
So I don't know.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.600
It probably depends on the market, right?

10:26.600 --> 10:29.520
Depends on the... Yeah, because I bet you what you outlined is probably really true

10:29.520 --> 10:31.320
as well.

10:31.320 --> 10:32.320
It's interesting regardless.

10:32.320 --> 10:33.320
You're right.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.360
It's interesting to have a little more clarification on what they've reached here.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.480
But Red Hat may have another solution in the works.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.280
It's something they've been working on for a little while.

10:40.280 --> 10:41.440
You may be familiar with it.

10:41.440 --> 10:47.320
We covered it briefly on Linux Action News Episode 13 on Sunday.

10:47.320 --> 10:49.320
It's called Stratus.

10:49.320 --> 10:57.320
And it's a overall umbrella project for combining different built-in storage solutions in Linux

10:57.320 --> 11:04.160
already, like LVM, and RAID management, and copy-on-write capabilities, and excellent

11:04.160 --> 11:05.160
compression utilities.

11:05.160 --> 11:12.440
In fact, they just made a software purchase where their core focus is compression on SSD.

11:12.440 --> 11:17.760
And Stratus initially plans to use Device Mapper and the XFS system to bring a layered

11:17.760 --> 11:22.920
approach to taking these tools that already exist on Linux that essentially achieve what

11:22.920 --> 11:29.520
ZFS does, and put them in sort of a stacked system where you extend existing tools instead

11:29.520 --> 11:32.000
of creating entirely new stuff whole cloth.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.520
You use the XFS file system, which I think is one of the best file systems on any operating

11:36.520 --> 11:46.400
system on the planet today, and you take a customer-driven sort of demand.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.560
What Red Hat seems to have outlined is we have a lot of customers coming to us that

11:49.560 --> 11:54.480
have super-fast SSD storage, they have super-fast CPUs, and they have a shit-ton of containers.

11:54.480 --> 11:58.040
And they want to compress those containers on disk, they want to read the compressed

11:58.040 --> 12:03.720
version of the container, have their super-crazy-fast CPU decompress it crazy-fast, and execute

12:03.720 --> 12:04.880
the code.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.880
And that's one of the things that ZFS is really good at.

12:07.880 --> 12:12.760
But if you think about it, ZFS is a bit of a bastard, and Alan Jude's not going to like

12:12.760 --> 12:17.480
me saying this, but in a way, it does something that nothing else out there does that we really

12:17.480 --> 12:18.700
never talk about.

12:18.700 --> 12:21.920
And it's the fact that it is a layer-violating monster.

12:21.920 --> 12:26.360
It takes all of these tools that used to be at different parts of the OS stack and smashes

12:26.360 --> 12:28.440
it all down to the file system layer.

12:28.440 --> 12:32.660
Not necessarily a bad idea, because then you have some cohesiveness between the tools,

12:32.660 --> 12:34.520
but it's also a little untried.

12:34.520 --> 12:39.520
So I like this idea of taking existing, known-good, production-ready tools already in Linux and

12:39.520 --> 12:41.660
stacking it on top of XFS.

12:41.660 --> 12:45.280
That's what Stratus is, and it's going to do copy-on-write, it's going to do compression,

12:45.280 --> 12:49.560
it's going to do encryption, it's going to do device mapper management, all that volume

12:49.560 --> 12:55.520
management stuff, snapshots, all that stuff, and it's going to be a sort of whole project

12:55.520 --> 12:58.520
solution replacement to ButterFS.

12:58.520 --> 13:06.240
I'll be the hater in this case, because I feel like the exact thing you don't want in

13:06.240 --> 13:10.520
a file system is a bunch of utilities being developed independently of each other that

13:10.520 --> 13:11.520
you're smashing together.

13:11.520 --> 13:12.520
Yeah.

13:12.520 --> 13:17.120
So if a Stratus project could come in and sort of work cross-project to sort of unify

13:17.120 --> 13:18.120
it, that could work.

13:18.120 --> 13:21.320
Yeah, assuming that all the projects are happy to work with each other.

13:21.320 --> 13:22.800
Yeah, that's true.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.040
But Unix philosophy and such.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.040
Yeah.

13:26.040 --> 13:32.840
Yeah, I also think it's very possible that it could be excessively complex.

13:32.840 --> 13:37.920
This could be way too complex, and so it may not be very approachable.

13:37.920 --> 13:43.000
It raises the floor of the potential issues that you could have, because you're working

13:43.000 --> 13:44.600
with a bunch of independent components.

13:44.600 --> 13:48.960
So every place that you have separate components talking to each other is a potential breakage

13:48.960 --> 13:49.960
point.

13:49.960 --> 13:50.960
Yeah.

13:50.960 --> 13:51.960
Okay, now I'm on your side, because I'm going to also...

13:51.960 --> 13:55.760
Well, that's true, but I don't think it's going to be a huge number of projects in this

13:55.760 --> 13:56.760
case.

13:56.760 --> 14:03.280
And some of them, like XFS, still, but do you want even one in your file system?

14:03.280 --> 14:06.160
Because here's an example where I think it makes a difference.

14:06.160 --> 14:12.720
So one of the nice things about ZFS is you could have an array of ZFS drives in a Linux

14:12.720 --> 14:15.800
box, and the host ZFS box totally dies.

14:15.800 --> 14:21.000
You could take that array, attach it to a BSD machine, an Ubuntu machine, an Arch machine,

14:21.000 --> 14:25.240
anything that has ZFS support, and that all comes right back up online, and you have access

14:25.240 --> 14:26.240
to the data.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.560
And one of the things that makes that possible is the ZFS feature flag.

14:29.560 --> 14:33.580
So when they build ZFS, they say, these are the features of this version of ZFS.

14:33.580 --> 14:35.400
It's like a stable API.

14:35.400 --> 14:39.160
So the client utilities know what to expect from that version of ZFS.

14:39.160 --> 14:44.000
So even if I take something I created on Ubuntu 16.04, which might be an older version of

14:44.000 --> 14:48.880
ZFS than what I'm using on an Arch rolling box today, it's still going to work just fine.

14:48.880 --> 14:55.760
Because the feature flag setup, it was designed with this very eventuality in mind.

14:55.760 --> 15:00.240
I don't know if you're going to get that same cohesiveness from an array of projects, like

15:00.240 --> 15:01.240
in Project Stratus, because...

15:01.240 --> 15:02.640
I think you could add that on the top.

15:02.640 --> 15:07.200
You could, but what happens if you move from, say, a Red Hat Enterprise 8 box, and you attach

15:07.200 --> 15:08.960
it to a Red Hat Enterprise 10 box?

15:08.960 --> 15:12.680
I mean, the tool differences, the tools in Project Stratus...

15:12.680 --> 15:13.680
You're right, you would then have to...

15:13.680 --> 15:14.680
It could be hugely different.

15:14.680 --> 15:15.680
...have to have support for those.

15:15.680 --> 15:19.480
So either Stratus would implement the conversion between them, or you'd have to rely on the

15:19.480 --> 15:20.480
underlying tools.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.600
And I don't know anything about the architecture of Stratus, so I don't know which way how

15:23.600 --> 15:24.600
that might play out.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.600
Yeah, that's right.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.600
You're right.

15:26.600 --> 15:31.120
And since it is like LVM and XFS, it's pretty solid, pretty tried and true, not very fast

15:31.120 --> 15:32.120
moving.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.120
It could go that way, I guess.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.760
I just don't know enough yet to preclude that as a...

15:35.760 --> 15:38.600
But that kind of points something out.

15:38.600 --> 15:44.320
If you have to account for migrations, then you're going to have to account for different

15:44.320 --> 15:51.720
mixing variants of the tool sets underneath it for each migration, which seems super complicated.

15:51.720 --> 15:54.400
Especially if different distros go in different directions with it, like they take Stratus

15:54.400 --> 15:55.400
and they...

15:55.400 --> 15:57.720
Monkey Comm, what do you think?

15:57.720 --> 16:04.760
Have you actually seen that happen in the wild where you can take a ZFS array and move

16:04.760 --> 16:09.000
it to a different operating system and just have it recognize everything?

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
I have moved a ZFS array from one version of an older FreeNAS to a newer version of

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
FreeNAS.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.680
I definitely have done that myself, but I don't know if I've done one from FreeNAS to

16:19.680 --> 16:20.680
Ubuntu.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.460
But as long as the major ZFS versions are the same, as long as the on-desk format and

16:24.460 --> 16:25.640
feature sets are the...

16:25.640 --> 16:29.240
I think the other thing to think about here is, I wonder, how many of these projects does

16:29.240 --> 16:31.200
Red Hat already employ people to work on?

16:31.200 --> 16:32.920
Because that would be perhaps a large factor, too.

16:32.920 --> 16:36.200
Do they feel they already have a significant stake or control where they have confidence

16:36.200 --> 16:37.360
in the direction of the projects?

16:37.360 --> 16:38.720
I don't know.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.000
This is interesting, though.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.120
It really is like a giving up on ButterFS.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.120
It really is.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.500
We weren't totally sure when we were talking about this last week, but it's absolutely

16:46.500 --> 16:47.860
Red Hat saying...

16:47.860 --> 16:48.860
What about SUSE?

16:48.860 --> 16:49.860
Yeah.

16:49.860 --> 16:50.860
I don't know.

16:50.860 --> 16:51.860
What about SUSE?

16:51.860 --> 16:52.860
Did we talk about that last week?

16:52.860 --> 16:53.860
Where does that leave SUSE?

16:53.860 --> 16:54.860
No, I don't think so.

16:54.860 --> 16:57.880
Well, I would say look back to see what they did with RiserFS.

16:57.880 --> 17:01.040
How long until the rest of the community moved on from RiserFS did it take them to go to

17:01.040 --> 17:02.280
something else?

17:02.280 --> 17:03.280
And that might be your answer.

17:03.280 --> 17:04.520
They seem to like to stick around.

17:04.520 --> 17:09.220
Plus, they've really built a lot of pretty nice tools on top of ButterFS.

17:09.220 --> 17:10.220
So if I were them...

17:10.220 --> 17:14.080
It would be neat to see some of those ported right over to ZFS, and then I would use...

17:14.080 --> 17:15.080
I mean, the tools are kind of neat.

17:15.080 --> 17:16.080
Yeah.

17:16.080 --> 17:17.080
Yeah, yeah.

17:17.080 --> 17:18.800
Do they use ButterFS for a default file system?

17:18.800 --> 17:19.800
Yeah.

17:19.800 --> 17:24.240
ButterFS is default, and the package manager can take snapshots using ButterFS.

17:24.240 --> 17:25.560
There's some new other tools they're working on.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.600
Don't they have some boot environment similar stuff as well?

17:27.600 --> 17:28.600
Yeah.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.160
There's some other tools they're working on they're using ButterFS as well.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.400
And maybe they'll just keep plugging away at it and keep making it better.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.840
It's not like they can't just keep...

17:33.840 --> 17:34.840
Right.

17:34.840 --> 17:35.840
Yeah.

17:35.840 --> 17:36.840
You know what's kind of funny?

17:36.840 --> 17:38.560
If Canonical did this, people would lose their minds.

17:38.560 --> 17:41.240
But when Red Hat does it, people are not doing the not invented here thing.

17:41.240 --> 17:44.560
Well, it's because nobody thinks it's going to be adopted outside of Red Hat.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.560
I mean...

17:45.560 --> 17:47.120
Well, people said that about SystemD.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.120
Yeah.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.120
Yeah.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.880
It's all up on GitHub right now if you want to check it out.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.560
There's also, let's see, stratus-storage.github.io.

17:54.560 --> 17:55.680
Yeah.

17:55.680 --> 17:56.680
And I think one of the things...

17:56.680 --> 17:57.680
It's hard to find.

17:57.680 --> 17:58.680
They don't advertise it, but it's...

17:58.680 --> 17:59.680
No.

17:59.680 --> 18:00.680
There's not a lot of talk about this.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.680
No.

18:01.680 --> 18:02.680
We should probably get somebody on the show to talk about this.

18:02.680 --> 18:03.680
That's a good idea.

18:03.680 --> 18:04.680
That would be the thing.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.440
Because I think one of the reasons it's not getting a ton of attention is because it's

18:06.440 --> 18:08.200
just improving existing tools.

18:08.200 --> 18:12.640
It's not like some radical rebirth of a brand new way of doing things.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.400
Well, that, and it's also enterprise focused.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.560
Yeah, I suppose so, yeah.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.200
There is a big radical update today, though.

18:18.200 --> 18:21.160
I just installed it today, just a few hours before the show.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.760
Firefox 55.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.160
Holy crap, guys.

18:24.160 --> 18:27.000
I was like, okay, we're probably gonna stop talking about Firefox for a little bit.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.480
We've been talking a lot about Firefox.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.480
No.

18:29.480 --> 18:30.480
Holy crap.

18:30.480 --> 18:34.200
Firefox 55 is legit.

18:34.200 --> 18:38.800
Initial features also besides the new fancy rendering that is crazy fast and the...

18:38.800 --> 18:42.960
I haven't used the new dark minimal theme, but man is it great.

18:42.960 --> 18:45.400
Web VR, I think, is also landing on the Windows version.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.400
Oh.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.400
That doesn't help me.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.400
No.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.400
In fact, they have a little promo video.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.720
Let's check this quick little video out, really.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.680
Oh, yeah.

18:54.680 --> 19:00.400
So she's painting, and of course, there's sort of like Kickstarter music playing in

19:00.400 --> 19:01.400
the background.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.400
It's like, I don't know what else to call that.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.400
I'd buy that painting.

19:03.400 --> 19:07.720
A Steve Jobs looking guy sits down, and now they're talking silently.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.400
No, she just walked right away.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.400
Yeah.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.400
I wonder if you could turn that into VR.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.400
Don't look at her.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.400
That's private.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.480
No more stupid painting in real life.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.600
Now you can paint in VR.

19:16.600 --> 19:20.400
And so the web VR is actually a technology that Noah and I saw demoed a couple of years

19:20.400 --> 19:22.160
ago at OSCON running under Linux.

19:22.160 --> 19:25.560
So I thought it was kind of odd that it's actually not shipping on the Linux version

19:25.560 --> 19:27.320
of Firefox 55.

19:27.320 --> 19:28.640
But holy smokes.

19:28.640 --> 19:32.960
First of all, it seems like to me that every single web page I could throw at it loads

19:32.960 --> 19:33.960
faster.

19:33.960 --> 19:34.960
Let's do a little live test.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.360
Give me a complicated website.

19:36.360 --> 19:41.280
I got Firefox loaded up right here, 55 on my machine, using their new minimal dark theme,

19:41.280 --> 19:42.440
which is slick.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.160
How about the Amazon front page?

19:44.160 --> 19:45.160
Amazon.com?

19:45.160 --> 19:46.160
All right.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.160
You can download it anywhere in this browser.

19:47.160 --> 19:48.160
It's Amazon.com.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.160
It looks nice.

19:49.160 --> 19:50.160
Can I just say?

19:50.160 --> 19:51.160
Yeah.

19:51.160 --> 19:52.160
And boom.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.160
Amazon.com is loaded.

19:53.160 --> 19:54.160
That was fast.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.160
That was suspiciously fast.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.160
Yeah, it's nice.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.160
It's nice.

19:57.160 --> 19:58.160
What's another complex?

19:58.160 --> 19:59.160
Twitch, maybe?

19:59.160 --> 20:00.160
Twitch?

20:00.160 --> 20:01.160
OK.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.160
Twitch.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.160
Is it twitch.tv, right?

20:03.160 --> 20:04.160
Twitch.tv.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.160
And it's loading.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.160
Pow.

20:06.160 --> 20:10.400
And also one of the things they've done is Flash is click to start now by default.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.400
Is that right?

20:11.400 --> 20:12.400
Yes, finally.

20:12.400 --> 20:17.000
And this is also, I think, the one where electrolysis is turned on for everyone.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.040
Do you know if that's right, Michael?

20:19.040 --> 20:21.600
No, 54 is when it came on for everyone.

20:21.600 --> 20:22.600
And then it's in 50.

20:22.600 --> 20:23.600
Well, when it came in stable.

20:23.600 --> 20:24.600
OK.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.080
And then it's not on for everyone, but whatever.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.560
58 is the one where...

20:28.560 --> 20:29.560
57.

20:29.560 --> 20:32.840
57 is the one where the traditional plugins go away, the traditional extensions.

20:32.840 --> 20:36.200
Yeah, 57 web extensions only.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.440
I mean, this is really good.

20:37.440 --> 20:38.440
This is...

20:38.440 --> 20:41.520
I know you've been saying this, but this is really good.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.280
This is really fast.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.280
Really good.

20:44.280 --> 20:46.520
I'm very excited for Firefox and where they're going.

20:46.520 --> 20:51.440
I am a little worried that when they kill off extensions, it's going to be super challenging

20:51.440 --> 20:54.240
for Firefox.

20:54.240 --> 20:57.000
I was looking at some of the extensions I use and I don't even think more than one or

20:57.000 --> 20:59.800
two of them have been updated, including I think even last...

20:59.800 --> 21:03.720
There's actually a website that lists what's being changed.

21:03.720 --> 21:08.760
It's a really absurd link URL, so I can't remember what it is, but it's on the Mozilla

21:08.760 --> 21:14.400
site, they have a web extensions port thing, and there's a lot of things that are being

21:14.400 --> 21:18.720
ported that haven't finished being ported, but they are still being in the works, and

21:18.720 --> 21:23.520
they should be done by the 57 release at the very latest.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.120
Some of them will be 58.

21:25.120 --> 21:31.800
But there's a lot of extensions that are also just being destroyed, unfortunately, because

21:31.800 --> 21:32.800
there's one thing I use.

21:32.800 --> 21:37.560
The tab groups extension was just abandoned like six months ago.

21:37.560 --> 21:39.760
I remember that, I use it as well.

21:39.760 --> 21:47.040
The guy was like, well, I'd have to rewrite the whole thing and I don't want to, so sorry.

21:47.040 --> 21:51.080
Joey over at OMG Ubuntu also points out that you'll find a new performance section under

21:51.080 --> 21:55.220
preferences general, where you can choose to use recommended performance setting or

21:55.220 --> 22:00.040
you could dive in and manually enable or disable hardware acceleration, which is probably going

22:00.040 --> 22:02.840
to be dependent on what your distro supports.

22:02.840 --> 22:10.160
And you can set a multi-promise, I'm sorry, a multi-promise, a multi-process content limit.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.160
That's really interesting.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.160
Mm-hmm.

22:12.160 --> 22:17.320
One of my favorite things about this, it used to be we had to go into about config in order

22:17.320 --> 22:18.320
to do this.

22:18.320 --> 22:19.320
Yeah.

22:19.320 --> 22:23.660
The new feature is making it a lot easier, but you can have it where by default there's

22:23.660 --> 22:28.200
four processes in the electrolysis structure, but you can make it as many as you want.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.200
Holy crap.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.200
I'm turning that up.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.200
Yeah.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.200
Oh, wow.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.120
I'm turning that up to a six.

22:34.120 --> 22:38.000
So Chris, how does this, does this change any of your feelings about Firefox?

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Yep.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.600
Because I think there's been kind of two problems, right?

22:40.600 --> 22:45.080
There's been technical criticisms as well as more cultural societal criticisms.

22:45.080 --> 22:49.720
Well, I feel like I'm not alone.

22:49.720 --> 22:53.700
Maybe I'm hopping on a bandwagon I didn't realize, but I feel like there is a lot of

22:53.700 --> 22:56.160
underdog type coverage for Firefox right now.

22:56.160 --> 23:03.800
CNET just ran a piece called Firefox Fights Back with like intense artwork and just like

23:03.800 --> 23:05.840
a... Is this some sort of browser wars video game

23:05.840 --> 23:06.840
I can play?

23:06.840 --> 23:07.840
Right, right.

23:07.840 --> 23:13.840
It's a super stylized piece from CNET about Firefox 57 that's going to be out in November.

23:13.840 --> 23:18.200
This was a logo that was, this was a design art thing that someone made, that the event

23:18.200 --> 23:20.400
made to announce the 57 thing.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.400
Yeah.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.400
It's cool.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.400
This was like a couple months ago they made that.

23:23.400 --> 23:26.000
I was kind of thinking it was something like that.

23:26.000 --> 23:32.200
And so I noticed a general turning in the opinion about Firefox, but for myself what

23:32.200 --> 23:38.120
really has really sort of... Of course I've been watching them persistently improve Firefox

23:38.120 --> 23:44.300
for a while now, so that plays a role as well, but for me it's really Chrome has started

23:44.300 --> 23:47.600
to exhibit issues that I had in Firefox that made me switch to Chrome and that is that

23:47.600 --> 23:53.600
my extensions, I uninstall an extension to sort of like slim down my Chrome install and

23:53.600 --> 23:57.640
then over time depending on what computer I sit down at or something my extensions get

23:57.640 --> 24:01.860
re-added back and then I have way more extensions than I ever had and then of course there's

24:01.860 --> 24:05.520
like only two or three extensions I really need and one of them is crashing constantly

24:05.520 --> 24:08.420
on the computer here on the live stream.

24:08.420 --> 24:10.600
So I've just really kind of been in a tough spot with Chrome.

24:10.600 --> 24:16.220
Plus I'm getting increasingly more uncomfortable with Google all the time and the power that

24:16.220 --> 24:18.680
they're using, the power that Chrome is giving them.

24:18.680 --> 24:22.440
So I've just been kind of curious where Firefox is going and man if they aren't really there

24:22.440 --> 24:26.480
now like you can... I feel like with 55 if you've sort of been sitting back and just

24:26.480 --> 24:31.280
sort of watching from a distance using Chrome in this meantime, I feel like with 55 you

24:31.280 --> 24:32.960
really feel it.

24:32.960 --> 24:35.980
It's like the release where it really hits you and you're like, okay dang.

24:35.980 --> 24:38.580
It's about three times faster.

24:38.580 --> 24:41.400
It's very noticeably faster than 54.

24:41.400 --> 24:42.400
That is pretty great.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.760
What platform did you try it on Chris?

24:44.760 --> 24:48.240
I was... Well it's on this machine here which is under Arch.

24:48.240 --> 24:51.680
They're both Arch boxes.

24:51.680 --> 24:54.520
I haven't tried it much else because I was just trying it before the show today.

24:54.520 --> 25:00.400
But on the system upstairs and on this system which are identical in spec, it's just super

25:00.400 --> 25:01.400
fast.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.400
No real extensions.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.400
I installed Privacy Badger and that was it.

25:04.400 --> 25:07.880
That was my only extension I installed because I didn't want to break electrolysis and I

25:07.880 --> 25:10.480
wasn't sure where that line is or not.

25:10.480 --> 25:11.480
There may be in it.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.280
There's a testing ability.

25:13.280 --> 25:18.560
You can actually test to see if an extension is breaking it by running an experimental

25:18.560 --> 25:21.400
thing inside of Firefox.

25:21.400 --> 25:25.520
Did you see... Did you have Firefox installed there on your Slackware install, Wes?

25:25.520 --> 25:26.520
Oh no.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.240
I guess it came with it but an older version.

25:28.240 --> 25:29.240
Yeah.

25:29.240 --> 25:30.240
It's 24.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.240
Oh.

25:31.240 --> 25:32.240
ESR.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.240
It's Firefox 24.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.240
Yeah.

25:34.240 --> 25:35.240
Woo.

25:35.240 --> 25:36.240
I got Chrome installed now though so it's fine.

25:36.240 --> 25:37.240
Okay.

25:37.240 --> 25:38.240
Well we'll talk about that.

25:38.240 --> 25:39.240
But yeah.

25:39.240 --> 25:43.340
So there was during the week running on a Firefox 24 and then I go over to the Arch

25:43.340 --> 25:45.600
machine and I'm running on Firefox 25.

25:45.600 --> 25:46.600
It was pretty funny.

25:46.600 --> 25:47.600
It was like, oh.

25:47.600 --> 25:48.600
Well.

25:48.600 --> 25:49.900
It's only an installation away, Chris.

25:49.900 --> 25:52.360
It is the ESR release out of all fairness.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.360
Right.

25:53.360 --> 25:54.360
It is an ESR.

25:54.360 --> 25:56.560
I saw also... I saw Firefox like...

25:56.560 --> 25:58.000
It's a very old ESR.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.480
I saw like 52 or 42 also available for Slackware somewhere in the... So there's a more modern

26:03.480 --> 26:04.480
version available as well.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.480
52 is an ESR as well.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.480
Yeah.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.480
Yeah.

26:07.480 --> 26:11.320
But you know, 24 ESR is definitely not maintained by Mozilla anymore.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.680
No.

26:12.680 --> 26:16.620
There is some cool things like the page shot that's coming in or it was a screenshot basically

26:16.620 --> 26:19.060
but it's in 55 now.

26:19.060 --> 26:26.200
And also the... As far as people like getting weary of Google and wanting to get excited

26:26.200 --> 26:32.960
about Mozilla's work, the common voice integration they're doing with the new voice system and

26:32.960 --> 26:33.960
the...

26:33.960 --> 26:34.960
Voice search.

26:34.960 --> 26:35.960
Yeah.

26:35.960 --> 26:36.960
Yeah.

26:36.960 --> 26:37.960
The voice search.

26:37.960 --> 26:42.320
But also the Mozilla SEND structure, the SEND 2 is an open source feature so you can actually

26:42.320 --> 26:44.280
like run your own instance if you want to.

26:44.280 --> 26:51.640
So instead of having like multiple products that are somewhat related, they're just focusing

26:51.640 --> 26:59.320
now on different features and stuff to have a cohesive community approach of a good suite

26:59.320 --> 27:00.320
for a browser.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.320
Yeah.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.320
Yeah.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.320
I think SEND's an interesting project.

27:03.320 --> 27:05.320
I'm really glad that it's available for self-hosting too.

27:05.320 --> 27:08.640
I think that's sort of its killer feature.

27:08.640 --> 27:12.480
I've been following them more and more for Linux Action News and I like what I see.

27:12.480 --> 27:16.000
I think some things though still make me scratch my head to be honest.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.820
I try to stay mostly positive about the Mozilla Foundation but there are some things they

27:18.820 --> 27:21.120
get into, I'm like, what a waste of time and money.

27:21.120 --> 27:26.120
But for their core thing, Firefox, this is the best Firefox I've ever seen.

27:26.120 --> 27:29.040
I would definitely say it's worth the upgrade to 55, definitely.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.040
And 57 is already coming in November.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.040
Ooh.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.040
That's exciting.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.040
Yeah.

27:34.040 --> 27:39.080
Also, little side note, get a little more of a producer Michael there.

27:39.080 --> 27:42.680
He was on the most recent episode of Late Night Linux as one of their co-hosts.

27:42.680 --> 27:43.680
He did a great job.

27:43.680 --> 27:44.680
Good work on that, Michael.

27:44.680 --> 27:45.680
That's awesome.

27:45.680 --> 27:46.680
Yeah.

27:46.680 --> 27:51.600
And check out Late Night, or I'm sorry, you can also check out Joe on Linux Action News,

27:51.600 --> 27:53.280
which I've now mentioned several times.

27:53.280 --> 27:56.720
But it's because we've been covering all of this on there.

27:56.720 --> 27:57.720
Yeah.

27:57.720 --> 28:01.920
Anyways, more info from OMG Ubuntu, which we will have linked in the show notes.

28:01.920 --> 28:05.320
And I think I'm going to, I'm not saying I'm making a big switch, I'm not making a big

28:05.320 --> 28:06.800
deal out of it.

28:06.800 --> 28:09.200
I'm just going to use it more.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.520
I'm just going to start using it more for more stuff.

28:11.520 --> 28:12.520
And then 57 switch.

28:12.520 --> 28:13.520
Makes sense.

28:13.520 --> 28:14.520
Maybe.

28:14.520 --> 28:15.520
Maybe.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.920
I mean, I'm just going to, basically I'm just going to get spun up and running alongside

28:17.920 --> 28:18.920
Chrome.

28:18.920 --> 28:19.920
It'll have a place.

28:19.920 --> 28:23.160
And then if I see if I can just make the hop over, you know, see eventually if I can't

28:23.160 --> 28:24.160
get there.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.160
Why do you even have to choose one over the other?

28:25.160 --> 28:26.160
Why not just use both?

28:26.160 --> 28:27.160
Right.

28:27.160 --> 28:30.160
I think what would happen is one might become the primary driver, which always is the one

28:30.160 --> 28:33.600
with the canonical bookmarks and all that kind of stuff and the canonical extensions.

28:33.600 --> 28:36.160
And then one would become like my backup browser.

28:36.160 --> 28:39.960
What you need is a cross browser bookmark syncing.

28:39.960 --> 28:41.360
So they're both bookmarked.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.360
Yeah.

28:42.360 --> 28:44.040
There was something that did that for a long time.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.320
My other problem is the links.

28:45.320 --> 28:50.240
Like when I want it to open, like which one's my default, like a gnome extension to switch

28:50.240 --> 28:51.240
your default.

28:51.240 --> 28:52.240
That would be nice.

28:52.240 --> 28:53.240
Right.

28:53.240 --> 28:55.320
I just don't want everyone, every, I want every application to let me right click and

28:55.320 --> 28:56.320
open in the browser.

28:56.320 --> 29:00.880
A little switch in your, your task bar that, that switches between Chrome and Firefox.

29:00.880 --> 29:05.600
Like a middleware for all mime types that opens up with a like, what do you want?

29:05.600 --> 29:06.600
We're getting crazy.

29:06.600 --> 29:07.600
Let's take a moment.

29:07.600 --> 29:08.600
Let's calm down.

29:08.600 --> 29:09.600
Let's talk about digital ocean.

29:09.600 --> 29:10.600
Woo.

29:10.600 --> 29:11.600
Right.

29:11.600 --> 29:12.600
I bet you could do it with their API Chris.

29:12.600 --> 29:13.600
I bet you could.

29:13.600 --> 29:15.440
They got a great API and a dashboard for days.

29:15.440 --> 29:16.440
Digital ocean.com.

29:16.440 --> 29:19.680
Go over there, log into that dashboard or create an account and apply our promo code

29:19.680 --> 29:21.400
D O unplugged.

29:21.400 --> 29:22.720
And you get a $10 credit.

29:22.720 --> 29:27.680
You can spin up their $5 rig two months for free or use their hourly pricing to bang around

29:27.680 --> 29:29.760
in a new open source project you're trying out.

29:29.760 --> 29:33.640
You can get deployed in seconds and all of their machines from their best price to their

29:33.640 --> 29:40.600
crazy big dogs that are monsters are all SSD based with lightning fast, 40 gigabit networks,

29:40.600 --> 29:42.120
team, team account capabilities.

29:42.120 --> 29:43.920
So you can work together with folks.

29:43.920 --> 29:48.520
Like so, so if you got like say an ultra speed and a Jupiter broadcasting kind of situation,

29:48.520 --> 29:52.200
highly available block storage so you can grow the storage on your droplet as you need

29:52.200 --> 29:53.200
it.

29:53.200 --> 29:54.200
Pre-built open source applications.

29:54.200 --> 29:58.600
You can get spun up or start with the machine from the very bare metal and you can use our

29:58.600 --> 30:01.200
HTML5 console to get some fancy features.

30:01.200 --> 30:05.000
And then they got boss mode where you can do monitoring and alerting, stand on top of

30:05.000 --> 30:09.980
performance, receive alerts when things go down and load balancing as a service and firewall

30:09.980 --> 30:13.660
at the network level so you can set rules and then they block it at the network level

30:13.660 --> 30:16.680
so that crap never even hits your droplet.

30:16.680 --> 30:19.440
DigitalOcean.com use our promo code D O unplugged.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.440
Damn what a good service.

30:20.440 --> 30:26.520
They just posted two days ago, or maybe about that, or maybe three days ago, how to install

30:26.520 --> 30:29.560
WordPress with Caddy on CentOS 7.

30:29.560 --> 30:34.080
So you want to get set up with Caddy and WordPress and this is a really nice way to manage WordPress

30:34.080 --> 30:36.320
and you want to do it on CentOS, they got a guy.

30:36.320 --> 30:37.320
Oh what?

30:37.320 --> 30:38.320
What?

30:38.320 --> 30:39.320
You don't want to do it on?

30:39.320 --> 30:40.320
Well they got a guy for Ubuntu 6.0.4.10.

30:40.320 --> 30:41.320
Oh my God, how do they do it?

30:41.320 --> 30:42.320
I wanted Fedora though.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.320
Just follow this.

30:43.320 --> 30:44.320
Just follow this.

30:44.320 --> 30:45.320
Okay.

30:45.320 --> 30:50.600
And they even have free BSD up there on that DigitalOcean.

30:50.600 --> 30:51.600
Go check it out.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.440
DigitalOcean.com use our promo code D O unplugged.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.120
Check out that dashboard for days.

30:56.120 --> 30:58.200
You just got to create that account first.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.200
You want to know something Chris?

30:59.200 --> 31:02.960
I think their dashboard sits on top of their API that everybody else uses.

31:02.960 --> 31:03.960
It is an API client.

31:03.960 --> 31:08.040
And I think that's why the API is so complete is because their dashboard is a client of

31:08.040 --> 31:11.200
their own API, which is a pretty hip way of doing things these days.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.560
You got to admit.

31:12.560 --> 31:13.560
They're real pros over there.

31:13.560 --> 31:14.560
They take it really seriously.

31:14.560 --> 31:15.560
And it means that-

31:15.560 --> 31:16.560
That's all their stuff is so good.

31:16.560 --> 31:17.560
Yeah.

31:17.560 --> 31:19.040
We use it every single live broadcast.

31:19.040 --> 31:20.400
So you know it's good stuff.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.400
Like we rely on it 100% here.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.400
Every day.

31:23.400 --> 31:24.400
Yeah.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.920
So DigitalOcean.com use our promo code D O unplugged after you've created your account

31:26.920 --> 31:32.440
and a huge thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring.

31:32.440 --> 31:33.440
All right.

31:33.440 --> 31:34.440
I'm very excited.

31:34.440 --> 31:38.360
I just decided before I went on air that I'm going to do a meetup, a last minute meetup

31:38.360 --> 31:41.080
in just a few days on August 21st.

31:41.080 --> 31:44.800
Something amazing is happening here in the States.

31:44.800 --> 31:49.780
On August 21st, the United States will be treated to a total solar eclipse.

31:49.780 --> 31:54.000
One that will span the country from sea to shining sea.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.760
It will be the first time that's happened in nearly 100 years.

31:57.760 --> 32:03.720
So this eclipse, solar eclipse, is going to be going right over just 200 miles south of

32:03.720 --> 32:04.720
Seattle.

32:04.720 --> 32:05.720
Like prime right over.

32:05.720 --> 32:08.480
And I'm like, OK, I got to see this.

32:08.480 --> 32:09.480
I got to go to this.

32:09.480 --> 32:10.480
I got to go.

32:10.480 --> 32:13.200
I mean, if it's only 200 miles away, I can jump in my truck and I never seen the Corona

32:13.200 --> 32:14.200
before.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.200
I can make that drive in five hours.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.200
I got to go.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.200
I got to go.

32:17.200 --> 32:21.320
So I've decided I am going to go on Monday the 21st down to the Oregon coast Pacific

32:21.320 --> 32:26.400
Wayside Crest is where I'm going to be at, which is about an hour and change east of

32:26.400 --> 32:27.840
Salem.

32:27.840 --> 32:30.400
And it's just north of Lincoln City.

32:30.400 --> 32:37.120
The sun and the moon are going to go directly over Lincoln City, like square smack dab.

32:37.120 --> 32:38.800
And we're just north of Lincoln City.

32:38.800 --> 32:43.400
And we're going to be on the coast, the Oregon coast, watching this eclipse over the water.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.560
It's going to be amazing.

32:45.560 --> 32:47.040
So I thought, you know what?

32:47.040 --> 32:51.200
If anybody's in that area, this is a this is a really once in a lifetime opportunity.

32:51.200 --> 32:55.060
If anybody's in that area and wants to meet up, maybe we should do it.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.060
Maybe we should do it.

32:56.060 --> 32:57.060
So I set up a meetup.

32:57.060 --> 32:59.720
As you go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, I think you'll you'll see it there.

32:59.720 --> 33:03.960
I also have a link in the show notes if you want to join me and Hidia.

33:03.960 --> 33:07.320
So so, Chris, have you ordered any of the the special solar glasses?

33:07.320 --> 33:12.120
No, but I did get an ND filter for my drone, which is the priority.

33:12.120 --> 33:15.360
So what you're saying is you're going to go to Oregon to see a solar eclipse and then

33:15.360 --> 33:17.120
you're going to look at a drone screen to watch it.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.120
Exactly.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.120
Yeah, it's HD.

33:19.120 --> 33:23.360
I'm going to order you some of those glasses.

33:23.360 --> 33:24.640
Yeah, I know.

33:24.640 --> 33:26.480
I know it's going to be crazy, Micah.

33:26.480 --> 33:27.960
It's going to be crazy.

33:27.960 --> 33:29.700
Crazy amounts of people in Oregon, I would imagine.

33:29.700 --> 33:31.480
I'm planning to sleep on the side of the road.

33:31.480 --> 33:32.760
I'm not even going to try to book.

33:32.760 --> 33:35.840
And this thing at this place that I'm having the meetup at is just like some like pull

33:35.840 --> 33:36.960
off on the side of the road.

33:36.960 --> 33:38.720
But it's right there on the on the water.

33:38.720 --> 33:39.720
It's got like parking.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.560
So I figured we give it a go.

33:41.560 --> 33:42.560
Is there good Wi-Fi, Chris?

33:42.560 --> 33:43.840
Well, I don't know.

33:43.840 --> 33:44.840
I could try to bring a Wi-Fi.

33:44.840 --> 33:48.600
If there's a good Wi-Fi, you could do a J.B. Eclipse stream like they're saying.

33:48.600 --> 33:49.600
So cool.

33:49.600 --> 33:50.600
Oh, my gosh.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.080
You know, if it's possible, I'd definitely consider it.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.920
That way for people that don't live in the path.

33:53.920 --> 33:54.920
That would be really cool, actually.

33:54.920 --> 33:57.360
Yeah, if we have a good signal there, I'd consider it.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.360
It's going to be on the coast.

33:58.360 --> 34:00.280
So we're either going to have great signal or no signal.

34:00.280 --> 34:03.040
So again, it's going to be Monday, August 21st.

34:03.040 --> 34:04.760
The eclipse happens around 10 a.m.

34:04.760 --> 34:07.040
It's going to run to about 1 p.m. for the viewing.

34:07.040 --> 34:08.560
So I figure we'll just have the meetup for that.

34:08.560 --> 34:12.040
It's Pacific Wayside Crest, and I have the address in the show notes as well as a link

34:12.040 --> 34:13.040
to the meetup.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.040
Could be fun, right?

34:14.040 --> 34:15.040
Oh, yeah.

34:15.040 --> 34:17.320
Ooh, Chris, are you going to become a citizen scientist?

34:17.320 --> 34:25.120
Do you often mix unknown chemicals together?

34:25.120 --> 34:29.480
I think that's all it takes.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.680
I think that's the start of Breaking Bad.

34:31.680 --> 34:32.680
Right?

34:32.680 --> 34:33.680
I'm getting confused.

34:33.680 --> 34:36.680
I think that's what's in an IPA.

34:36.680 --> 34:41.360
So I'm really excited because I'm just going to take Highway 101 down right on the gorgeous

34:41.360 --> 34:42.360
coast.

34:42.360 --> 34:45.000
I mean, people talk about the California coast and all that.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
It's nice.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.320
The Oregon coast is really a gem.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.720
It's one of the gems of the United States.

34:49.720 --> 34:53.400
If you ever want to come to the States and do a road trip, take the 101 coast.

34:53.400 --> 34:58.080
The only thing you're risking, though, being on that side of the mountains, is them clouds.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.080
Oh, yeah.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.080
Rain.

35:00.080 --> 35:02.680
Also, constant construction on Highway 101.

35:02.680 --> 35:03.680
Yeah, right.

35:03.680 --> 35:04.680
It's constant construction.

35:04.680 --> 35:09.400
But we're going to come down 101, end up just south of Pacific City, just a little north

35:09.400 --> 35:14.400
of Nesquen, north of Lincoln City, east of Salem.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.240
And gosh, what a cool event.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.200
Linux geeks hanging out, looking at an eclipse.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.460
We should also just mention that we're really very lucky.

35:20.460 --> 35:25.400
There's no reason that the area that the moon and the sun take up in the sky should be so

35:25.400 --> 35:26.400
close.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.400
Right.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.400
But they just happen to be.

35:28.400 --> 35:29.480
Well, the size difference, the location.

35:29.480 --> 35:30.480
It's amazing.

35:30.480 --> 35:31.480
Really, we'll get off this now.

35:31.480 --> 35:35.860
But the sun is 400 times larger than the moon.

35:35.860 --> 35:38.220
But it's also 400 times further away from the earth.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.360
So they wound up being about the same size in our sky.

35:40.360 --> 35:42.320
Just a wonderful natural chance.

35:42.320 --> 35:43.320
It's great.

35:43.320 --> 35:44.320
It is so great.

35:44.320 --> 35:45.320
I have another question.

35:45.320 --> 35:50.040
Between the sun and the moon, which one runs Windows and which one runs Linux?

35:50.040 --> 35:52.880
Definitely the moon, because nothing's ever changing with the moon.

35:52.880 --> 35:59.000
It's just boring and plain where the sun is constantly regenerating.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.880
Is that why the moon gets bigger in the fall?

36:00.880 --> 36:02.520
They install system data?

36:02.520 --> 36:03.520
No.

36:03.520 --> 36:06.440
And then the fall, it's the big, it's the fall creator's update or whatever the hell

36:06.440 --> 36:08.260
Microsoft calls it.

36:08.260 --> 36:11.640
So anyways, if you want to hang out with me, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, link

36:11.640 --> 36:12.640
in the show notes.

36:12.640 --> 36:13.640
I just think that'd be really cool.

36:13.640 --> 36:16.560
I'll probably do a little vlogging while I'm down there, do some drone shots.

36:16.560 --> 36:17.560
You never know.

36:17.560 --> 36:19.120
Could turn out crap, but could be a lot of fun.

36:19.120 --> 36:22.920
I want to give shout out to a friend of the show, Michael Dominic from Koda Radio, who's

36:22.920 --> 36:29.640
getting some love over at betanews.com this week for his new launch over at The Mad Botter,

36:29.640 --> 36:31.980
which is the Alice AI bot.

36:31.980 --> 36:32.980
And I love it.

36:32.980 --> 36:38.160
It's such a great idea because it handles all these things that as humans we're horrible

36:38.160 --> 36:41.920
at, like generating reports on the fly, nagging clients to pay.

36:41.920 --> 36:42.920
I hate that.

36:42.920 --> 36:46.680
I hate pinging your project members to get status updates.

36:46.680 --> 36:47.680
It's really cool.

36:47.680 --> 36:49.000
Great guy telling me to finish the show notes.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
Yeah.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.120
This guy, this guy, he sees J-Bot, he takes the idea and he monetize it and he doesn't

36:54.120 --> 36:56.040
even throw back me any money.

36:56.040 --> 36:59.680
Well he says that Alice was born out of the challenges he faced when managing a distributed

36:59.680 --> 37:00.680
team.

37:00.680 --> 37:05.040
Now I actually, I grok it because we have that too to a degree and the bot can just

37:05.040 --> 37:06.920
sort of smooth over a few areas.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.600
So it's pretty cool to see him getting that.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.320
If you're curious about it, check it out.

37:10.320 --> 37:15.960
He's got a great new website, themadbotter.com, where you can look at it.

37:15.960 --> 37:19.520
And also listen to last week's Coder Radio, he talks about some of the frameworks he used

37:19.520 --> 37:22.000
to create this and the backend stuff.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.680
It's a pretty cool project.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.120
Did he say what language it was in?

37:25.120 --> 37:29.120
Well it's all in the, I don't remember, but it's all in the Coder, yeah he did, but it's

37:29.120 --> 37:32.280
all in the Coder Radio that we did.

37:32.280 --> 37:34.360
Now let's talk about GTK4.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.000
It may be here sooner than we thought.

37:36.000 --> 37:40.160
Of course, Gwadek just wrapped up in Manchester and the GTK maintainers got together and started

37:40.160 --> 37:45.600
talking and they got together a list of current blockers for GTK4 and the list isn't as long

37:45.600 --> 37:46.600
as you might suspect.

37:46.600 --> 37:51.480
I don't think we have a timeline on any of these, but they're working on a really cool

37:51.480 --> 37:53.760
constraint based layout feature.

37:53.760 --> 37:59.080
They have also, they're working on a finished GL renderer.

37:59.080 --> 38:03.960
They are doing event cleanup, they're handling keyboard events better, they're working on

38:03.960 --> 38:06.000
non fallback text rendering.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.440
It's just a, it's like a few things that once these couple of like big and important, but

38:10.440 --> 38:16.800
not all of that major things get wrapped up, we essentially will have GTK4 upon us.

38:16.800 --> 38:24.360
Which is good, however I can think of a handful of places, except that aren't even caught

38:24.360 --> 38:26.900
up to GTK3 yet.

38:26.900 --> 38:29.640
So it's almost like they're getting lapped.

38:29.640 --> 38:30.640
What's that Alexa?

38:30.640 --> 38:31.640
She's not sure.

38:31.640 --> 38:32.640
Alexa?

38:32.640 --> 38:33.640
How are you feeling?

38:33.640 --> 38:34.640
You good?

38:34.640 --> 38:36.200
I'm doing great.

38:36.200 --> 38:37.200
Good, good.

38:37.200 --> 38:39.960
Great reading season, and I love a good story.

38:39.960 --> 38:40.960
Wow.

38:40.960 --> 38:42.600
The bitch needs to shut her mouth.

38:42.600 --> 38:43.600
Shut up.

38:43.600 --> 38:44.600
She likes a good story, Chris.

38:44.600 --> 38:45.600
I think it runs XFCE underneath.

38:45.600 --> 38:47.040
It just doesn't have a display port.

38:47.040 --> 38:48.040
Well she interrupted.

38:48.040 --> 38:51.800
The mumble room is more behaved than the Echo.

38:51.800 --> 38:54.480
Chris, maybe she just wants to learn about Linux.

38:54.480 --> 38:55.480
Don't be rude.

38:55.480 --> 38:56.480
Speaking of the mumble room.

38:56.480 --> 38:57.480
I feel fine.

38:57.480 --> 38:58.480
I love a good story.

38:58.480 --> 38:59.480
There you go.

38:59.480 --> 39:01.640
Anybody in the mumble room have thoughts about GTK4?

39:01.640 --> 39:02.640
Things still on GTK2?

39:02.640 --> 39:03.640
Anybody care?

39:03.640 --> 39:05.360
Any fun?

39:05.360 --> 39:11.400
I think that it's going to be an interesting thing, mainly because how many things that

39:11.400 --> 39:15.380
are based on GTK are going to be just sticking to the LTS so they don't have to have this

39:15.380 --> 39:17.880
massive headache.

39:17.880 --> 39:21.000
Like Mate has already pretty much pointed out that they're going to do it.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.800
I don't know if they made an official announcement, but there's been talks on the mailing list

39:24.800 --> 39:30.320
and stuff that they're going to stay with the LTS of GTK3.

39:30.320 --> 39:33.920
And how important is GTK4 other than GNOME users?

39:33.920 --> 39:36.200
I'm going to bet very little.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.240
Yeah, I agree.

39:38.240 --> 39:42.640
So do you guys ever have a friend who shows up and just sort of drops the bomb that they

39:42.640 --> 39:47.520
got this brand new amazing car or a huge powerful new laptop and they just try to be all sly

39:47.520 --> 39:48.520
about it?

39:48.520 --> 39:52.520
Like they want you to know, but they don't just want to come out and say, I bought something

39:52.520 --> 39:53.520
new.

39:53.520 --> 39:54.520
So they're like, oh yeah, that, yeah, I've got.

39:54.520 --> 39:55.520
Could you read this?

39:55.520 --> 39:56.520
It says BMW.

39:56.520 --> 39:58.920
Chris, I already talked about my video car.

39:58.920 --> 40:03.040
I know I'm just going to say it just like the video card.

40:03.040 --> 40:07.360
I feel like that's what our friends over at Purism are doing today.

40:07.360 --> 40:12.880
They're like, hey, go ahead and just share your input on our upcoming phone that everybody

40:12.880 --> 40:13.880
obviously knows.

40:13.880 --> 40:14.880
Wait, what?

40:14.880 --> 40:15.880
Yeah.

40:15.880 --> 40:16.880
Yeah.

40:16.880 --> 40:18.120
And then like, then they say, we know your time's precious.

40:18.120 --> 40:21.680
So we've made filling out the survey only a few minutes, but then the link to the surveys,

40:21.680 --> 40:23.440
I think it's crossed out.

40:23.440 --> 40:25.000
I don't know why it's crossed out.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.480
So apparently the survey was made a year ago.

40:27.480 --> 40:28.480
Okay.

40:28.480 --> 40:33.240
So apparently, apparently this is a thing that was floating around again on the web.

40:33.240 --> 40:36.400
This whole phone thing, this whole, like we're going to make a phone thing.

40:36.400 --> 40:39.600
I'd like to know if there's any, any smoke to this rumor or any fire to the smoke of

40:39.600 --> 40:43.240
a rumor because I've seen this floating around a couple of times.

40:43.240 --> 40:45.000
Are we making a phone?

40:45.000 --> 40:46.720
Are we really going to do this again?

40:46.720 --> 40:48.440
Are we really going to do that?

40:48.440 --> 40:49.440
Is that really?

40:49.440 --> 40:55.000
They, they say they're making a phone and they're using the core base bands that are

40:55.000 --> 40:58.720
built into it so they can have like, I forgot what they were, what they were using to make

40:58.720 --> 41:02.440
it compensate for it so that it will be, you'll use a regular distro.

41:02.440 --> 41:03.440
Yeah.

41:03.440 --> 41:06.600
It's, and it, they've been talking about it for quite a long time.

41:06.600 --> 41:07.600
Yeah.

41:07.600 --> 41:08.600
Well, it's just been not very, yeah.

41:08.600 --> 41:09.600
Well, yeah.

41:09.600 --> 41:13.120
But I've been saying like that, that's where they, last September they were talking about,

41:13.120 --> 41:14.680
you know, we're interested in it.

41:14.680 --> 41:20.240
They officially announced they were going to do it like seven months ago, but they do

41:20.240 --> 41:24.240
it, they, when they announce things, they do it and it's like, and this is the sly thing

41:24.240 --> 41:25.240
that you're saying.

41:25.240 --> 41:31.720
Like I, I talked to them in a conversation and they were like, oh, well, you know, and

41:31.720 --> 41:34.800
also we're, I'll go ahead and tell you we're working on a phone.

41:34.800 --> 41:35.800
Like, oh, okay.

41:35.800 --> 41:39.800
It's like, you might want to tell people that.

41:39.800 --> 41:43.240
I'm really, part of me wants to sit here and mock this.

41:43.240 --> 41:46.480
Like how have we not learned this lesson?

41:46.480 --> 41:47.480
Very painfully.

41:47.480 --> 41:51.900
But then, then I also sit here and I think, well, shit, I, there's not actually like one

41:51.900 --> 41:54.560
phone that I really would like, I'm super happy with right now.

41:54.560 --> 41:57.280
There is still room to build the right phone for me.

41:57.280 --> 42:03.600
Well, my question is why are they trying to put a desktop Linux distro on a phone when

42:03.600 --> 42:08.960
they're not, well, they're making a custom, it's, it's distro, it's a, it's a distro,

42:08.960 --> 42:12.780
desktop distro like underneath, but it's like, it's like how blow up plasma mobile is going

42:12.780 --> 42:13.780
to be.

42:13.780 --> 42:14.780
Yeah.

42:14.780 --> 42:15.780
But that's my question.

42:15.780 --> 42:19.640
Why don't they just use something like sailfish or plasma mobile that already exists rather

42:19.640 --> 42:22.640
than trying to reinvent the wheel again?

42:22.640 --> 42:26.920
As far as, well, plasma mobile is not ready and sailfish is unreliable.

42:26.920 --> 42:31.560
So put your development effort into that because it, well, yeah, this is a hard line because

42:31.560 --> 42:33.880
I agree with that part.

42:33.880 --> 42:37.800
I feel like they should be focusing on the laptops, like get the laptops just solid and

42:37.800 --> 42:39.160
shipping and you know, get all that.

42:39.160 --> 42:43.200
I know they're working on all that, but like to me, it just, that's where you have maybe

42:43.200 --> 42:47.160
the most buy-in already and you know, I want a Linux, great Linux laptop.

42:47.160 --> 42:48.160
Yeah.

42:48.160 --> 42:49.960
Are you desperate for a new phone?

42:49.960 --> 42:55.520
No, but I mean, we always talk about how Ubuntu failed at the phone, but I couldn't even get

42:55.520 --> 42:58.520
one if I wanted to when they were even making them.

42:58.520 --> 43:02.520
So it's like, what I get frustrated about is when everyone says that Ubuntu failed to

43:02.520 --> 43:05.520
deliver their phone, it was the hard version.

43:05.520 --> 43:11.960
Well, doesn't that tell you that them getting into this area might not be as easy as it

43:11.960 --> 43:12.960
sounds?

43:12.960 --> 43:16.320
I think Ubuntu is trying to build for the carriers.

43:16.320 --> 43:21.920
They wanted to have that phone in Verizon stores and AT&T stores and they were going

43:21.920 --> 43:22.920
head to head.

43:22.920 --> 43:27.280
If they would have just produced something that could run on the hardware that we get,

43:27.280 --> 43:29.520
then there we go.

43:29.520 --> 43:30.900
That is what Pureism is doing.

43:30.900 --> 43:36.480
They're talking about making one phone and the OS is specifically for that phone.

43:36.480 --> 43:38.760
I don't think that's a bad idea.

43:38.760 --> 43:41.680
I mean, that's how they solved the baseband issue.

43:41.680 --> 43:48.040
Poby, do you think this is worth trying still, especially maybe this type of approach?

43:48.040 --> 43:58.680
Having some experience in the open source-y phone area, I think it's difficult because

43:58.680 --> 44:02.760
each of the vendors took a completely different strategy.

44:02.760 --> 44:08.240
Like Mozilla took a completely different strategy with their Firefox phone than Sailfish did

44:08.240 --> 44:13.460
with theirs, than we did with ours, than Tizen do with theirs.

44:13.460 --> 44:20.560
The Tizen model is Samsung throw a giant bucket of money at it and that's what makes it happen.

44:20.560 --> 44:22.960
But the others chose completely different methods.

44:22.960 --> 44:30.280
If Pureism have a different strategy that differs from the failed strategies of Canonicals

44:30.280 --> 44:34.560
and Mozilla's, then maybe they have something.

44:34.560 --> 44:38.100
I'm not quite sure what that strategy would be that would be successful, but good luck

44:38.100 --> 44:39.100
to them.

44:39.100 --> 44:43.140
I do wonder if there is some room for low-volume handset manufacturers to do something that's

44:43.140 --> 44:44.640
different than the rest of the market.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.440
Minimac, isn't there a bigger problem though here?

44:47.440 --> 44:51.160
It's the ecosystem, the apps, the whole ecosystem.

44:51.160 --> 44:57.200
It's again another operating system with the application gap problem.

44:57.200 --> 45:02.780
See Ubuntu Touch had the good idea that they tried to do some web pages, use some web pages

45:02.780 --> 45:10.160
into apps with that, that would have been a lesser problem with the application gap.

45:10.160 --> 45:15.640
But if you have an operating system again where you have to develop some applications

45:15.640 --> 45:18.200
and everything, you will have some huge problems.

45:18.200 --> 45:20.000
It's always the same.

45:20.000 --> 45:28.040
I think the solution is obvious and it's been around for almost 10 years now and we've all

45:28.040 --> 45:29.040
had the solution.

45:29.040 --> 45:30.040
WebOS.

45:30.040 --> 45:31.040
WebOS.

45:31.040 --> 45:32.040
Oh my God.

45:32.040 --> 45:33.040
Oh wow.

45:33.040 --> 45:36.160
You know what else was a solution before WebOS?

45:36.160 --> 45:37.160
I love it.

45:37.160 --> 45:40.880
I think Nokia came out with that Mamo, which was just a Linux tablet.

45:40.880 --> 45:42.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:42.680 --> 45:44.080
It was actually pretty good.

45:44.080 --> 45:45.200
Yeah, yeah.

45:45.200 --> 45:46.560
Then MeeGo.

45:46.560 --> 45:47.560
It's funny you say that.

45:47.560 --> 45:48.560
MeeGo was cool.

45:48.560 --> 45:49.560
Oh, that's so true.

45:49.560 --> 45:50.560
That's all so true.

45:50.560 --> 45:54.040
Like we kind of did arrive on the solution, but it was just too early, I guess.

45:54.040 --> 45:57.080
Yeah, too early and their hardware was crap, but the software was amazing.

45:57.080 --> 46:03.240
I still have my Palm Pre plus, which is awesome, except for the hardware itself is crap.

46:03.240 --> 46:04.240
Yeah.

46:04.240 --> 46:08.280
Like the battery was atrocious, but the software is amazing still and you can still technically

46:08.280 --> 46:09.280
get it.

46:09.280 --> 46:12.040
It's just, I don't know.

46:12.040 --> 46:13.040
We have it.

46:13.040 --> 46:14.040
People use it.

46:14.040 --> 46:15.040
Just do it.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.040
There was a lot of really good ideas in it.

46:16.040 --> 46:19.400
I think that's why it still gets mentioned even today.

46:19.400 --> 46:20.400
Never will die.

46:20.400 --> 46:21.400
It never will die.

46:21.400 --> 46:22.400
All right.

46:22.400 --> 46:24.080
Well, we have some Slack to get to, don't we?

46:24.080 --> 46:29.600
But we also have a really cool application that uses just the built-in container features.

46:29.600 --> 46:31.520
Actually, that might be even giving it too much credit.

46:31.520 --> 46:37.280
It really just uses the built-in namespacing feature of Linux to give you some excellent

46:37.280 --> 46:40.320
security for anything that might be internet facing.

46:40.320 --> 46:41.800
It's like on-demand sandboxing.

46:41.800 --> 46:44.160
We're going to talk about that in just a moment.

46:44.160 --> 46:48.020
First, I want to thank Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

46:48.020 --> 46:49.020
This is just such a...

46:49.020 --> 46:53.880
I couldn't even imagine a sponsor this great when I was starting Jupyter Broadcasting.

46:53.880 --> 46:59.960
It's such a great fit because it's Linux focused, Linux enthusiasts, creating a platform for

46:59.960 --> 47:02.040
people to learn more about Linux.

47:02.040 --> 47:07.840
And that's what they work at every single day, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

47:07.840 --> 47:11.680
That's where you go to sign up and get a free seven-day trial so you can try the platform

47:11.680 --> 47:13.080
out as well.

47:13.080 --> 47:16.480
Self-paced in-depth video courses on every Linux, cloud, and DevOps topic.

47:16.480 --> 47:20.200
They give you hands-on scenario-based labs that really help you learn how to use this

47:20.200 --> 47:21.200
stuff.

47:21.200 --> 47:25.760
You get away with the self-experience of actually having hands-on with the material, which for

47:25.760 --> 47:28.260
me is a total anxiety solver.

47:28.260 --> 47:31.720
That goes from I'm totally anxious about a job to I got this.

47:31.720 --> 47:35.680
And if you ever get stuck, they have full-time human instructors that are there to help,

47:35.680 --> 47:37.560
ready to give you any advice that you might need.

47:37.560 --> 47:39.520
They spin up their cloud servers on demand.

47:39.520 --> 47:43.620
You select a distribution, the courseware and the cloud servers match that automatically.

47:43.620 --> 47:44.620
You're busy.

47:44.620 --> 47:45.620
We're all busy.

47:45.620 --> 47:48.400
So they have a course scheduler that works with your busy timeframe, helps you stick

47:48.400 --> 47:49.660
to your learning goals.

47:49.660 --> 47:52.560
If you just wanna deep dive and get certs, well, of course, they've got courses created

47:52.560 --> 47:54.440
specifically to prepare you for that.

47:54.440 --> 47:58.380
And Learning Pass, so if you wanna go down a series of courses and content planned by

47:58.380 --> 48:02.800
instructors for specific entire tracks of a career, they've got that too.

48:02.800 --> 48:06.200
Flashcards that are forked by a community that's stuffed full of Jupyter broadcasting

48:06.200 --> 48:07.200
members.

48:07.200 --> 48:12.400
It's such a great platform, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

48:12.400 --> 48:15.920
Grab the iOS or Android app as well so that way you get value on the go.

48:15.920 --> 48:20.240
And enjoy the downloadable stuff that works like offline, like their audio and their study

48:20.240 --> 48:21.240
guides.

48:21.240 --> 48:25.200
It's just great for taking on the go when you wanna listen to something offline, linuxacademy.com

48:25.200 --> 48:26.740
slash unplugged.

48:26.740 --> 48:30.280
And thank you... gotta get the bell in there.

48:30.280 --> 48:33.760
Thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program, linuxacademy.com slash

48:33.760 --> 48:35.400
unplugged.

48:35.400 --> 48:41.400
So FireJL is a suid program that, or a SUID program, that reduces the risk of security

48:41.400 --> 48:47.560
breaches by restricting the running environment, say of Firefox or Chrome, for example, to

48:47.560 --> 48:50.680
a Linux namespace, which is pretty cool right there.

48:50.680 --> 48:56.040
And it uses a couple other technologies that are all just baked right in to the Linux kernel.

48:56.040 --> 49:00.140
Stuff in the network stack, the process table, the mount table, it's written in C, it has

49:00.140 --> 49:06.760
virtually no dependencies, it runs on any Linux computer with a 3.x kernel or newer.

49:06.760 --> 49:07.760
Okay?

49:07.760 --> 49:09.600
If I got your attention, how great is this?

49:09.600 --> 49:13.280
This is one of these things I just love about Linux, I just love this, I get so fired up

49:13.280 --> 49:16.200
about this, because this is so fantastic.

49:16.200 --> 49:20.100
And so you know it's gonna be easy to get going, because there's no daemons running

49:20.100 --> 49:24.800
in the background, there's no complicated configuration files to edit, the sandbox is

49:24.800 --> 49:28.440
super lightweight and the overhead is low because it's just using the namespace stuff

49:28.440 --> 49:33.000
built into the fricking kernel, and all the security features are implemented by the kernel,

49:33.000 --> 49:37.640
so as long as the kernel's good, this security of FireJL is good.

49:37.640 --> 49:42.920
So it's dumb, dumb, dumb easy to get working, you can just say, for example, if you want

49:42.920 --> 49:49.460
a FireJL VLC, who knows what that crazy VLC's doing, not nearly as trustworthy as that MPV,

49:49.460 --> 49:57.300
you could just write in FireJL space, I kid, I love you guys at VLC, FireJL space VLC,

49:57.300 --> 50:03.280
and it will start VideoLAN client in an isolated namespace, still has access to the network

50:03.280 --> 50:10.600
and can still do your business, but is completely, it could be violated, it could be violated

50:10.600 --> 50:15.440
with a zero day from Edward Snowden directly, his personal stash, and it's contained into

50:15.440 --> 50:16.560
this namespace.

50:16.560 --> 50:21.720
So if you have something that's internet facing, maybe like probably something like transmission,

50:21.720 --> 50:25.660
maybe you're doing torrents or something like that, and you have a listening port for remote

50:25.660 --> 50:30.300
web management, FireJL that son of a gun.

50:30.300 --> 50:35.840
That's a good phrase right there, that's the takeaway for the whole episode, just FireJL.

50:35.840 --> 50:41.040
There's also a graphical interface, which I haven't checked out, but it's called FireTools,

50:41.040 --> 50:42.960
what, what, what?

50:42.960 --> 50:51.640
The graphical interface is clunky and awkward, and it's not really a GUI, it's just like

50:51.640 --> 50:54.360
a little overlay thing, so most people wouldn't use it.

50:54.360 --> 50:55.840
Okay, so nice, so I've not tried it.

50:55.840 --> 50:58.720
It's better to put it in your.desktop file or something.

50:58.720 --> 51:04.160
Okay, so that would then, when you use the.desktop file, you would launch it with FireJL

51:04.160 --> 51:05.840
just to isolate it at start.

51:05.840 --> 51:06.840
Yeah.

51:06.840 --> 51:07.840
I like that.

51:07.840 --> 51:13.640
And also, I've been using FireJL for a long time because the best way to do security sandboxing

51:13.640 --> 51:15.200
of App Images is to use FireJL.

51:15.200 --> 51:16.760
Oh, tell me about that.

51:16.760 --> 51:22.960
Well, I mean, essentially it does the same thing that FireJLing a regular program would

51:22.960 --> 51:26.560
do, but the main thing about it with App Images is because App Images doesn't really have

51:26.560 --> 51:32.760
a security mechanism built into it, so FireJL kind of wraps that around giving it a sandboxing

51:32.760 --> 51:38.480
of an App Image, so you can have everything stored in its individual sandbox and namespace

51:38.480 --> 51:42.920
with App Images while at the same time App Images are still integrated with the theme

51:42.920 --> 51:48.480
and font and, you know, home folder config files and stuff like that.

51:48.480 --> 51:50.360
That is, that is, that is great.

51:50.360 --> 51:53.520
Veratuno, you've also used FireJL for a while.

51:53.520 --> 51:57.800
Yeah, I mean, I'm quite sure you mentioned on last, which you quite well picked up in

51:57.800 --> 52:02.560
the first place, but the cool thing about FireJL is that it will make SIM links for

52:02.560 --> 52:07.820
your common applications like Firefox and Thunderbird or whatever else, and the configuration

52:07.820 --> 52:11.580
files are very, very simple to look at because it basically gives you a set of directories

52:11.580 --> 52:16.720
to whitelist and blacklist and all that sort of stuff, and gives you restrictions to kind

52:16.720 --> 52:23.080
of read-write access to individual file system parts, which is quite good, but also quite

52:23.080 --> 52:27.280
annoying sometimes in Firefox because if you forget to sort of, like, you know, whitelist

52:27.280 --> 52:33.240
your download directory, then you're stuffed, but if you want to try and read from another

52:33.240 --> 52:37.160
directory to try and upload to a website, then you have to, you know, think about that

52:37.160 --> 52:42.000
effort ahead of time because obviously you're restricted to the file systems that you've

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
actually specified in the config file.

52:44.000 --> 52:48.480
So the other thing that's nice for Arch users out there is there is an AUR package that's

52:48.480 --> 52:54.840
FireJL-Extras, which has a bunch of extra security profiles, and for Fedora users, there's

52:54.840 --> 52:56.760
a copper build for it.

52:56.760 --> 53:00.840
There's also some Ansible, what do you call a role, right?

53:00.840 --> 53:01.840
It's an Ansible role.

53:01.840 --> 53:02.840
Is that what it is?

53:02.840 --> 53:07.000
There's Ansible roles for FireJL as well, which is pretty nice, and then there's a Bash

53:07.000 --> 53:10.160
script you can use, which maybe, I haven't used this either, but maybe producer Michael

53:10.160 --> 53:14.440
has, could be better than the GUI, it's called Firewarden, which is a Bash script to open

53:14.440 --> 53:17.680
a program with a private FireJL sandbox.

53:17.680 --> 53:24.520
Yeah, I've tried it, but I prefer the FireJL business, it's just a simple command, yeah.

53:24.520 --> 53:29.720
I use it for app images all the time, but I do want to point out one thing, it's a little

53:29.720 --> 53:30.720
weird.

53:30.720 --> 53:31.720
Oh yeah, go ahead.

53:31.720 --> 53:35.960
A security tool like this, who makes it?

53:35.960 --> 53:38.080
I have no idea who makes this.

53:38.080 --> 53:43.120
Like if you go to their website, no names, no GitHub accounts, nothing.

53:43.120 --> 53:46.560
There is absolutely nothing you could find about who makes this or anybody.

53:46.560 --> 53:49.080
Is there something great for security that you're trying to rely on?

53:49.080 --> 53:52.520
Look at this, a little conspiracy bacon here on the Linux.

53:52.520 --> 53:58.360
The only reason I use it is because it uses built-in kernel stuff, but it is pretty weird.

53:58.360 --> 53:59.360
Yeah, you're right.

53:59.360 --> 54:03.360
I mean, it's not like they're rolling their own crypto and creating their own sandbox

54:03.360 --> 54:06.240
technology, they're just a wrapper.

54:06.240 --> 54:07.800
But it is, that is weird.

54:07.800 --> 54:08.800
Now you got me looking.

54:08.800 --> 54:09.800
Now I'm digging around.

54:09.800 --> 54:14.480
You won't find it on their GitHub or their WordPress, and it's a WordPress site, it's

54:14.480 --> 54:17.000
not even like a real site.

54:17.000 --> 54:21.400
So these are like NSA namespaces that just send everything right back to them.

54:21.400 --> 54:22.400
No, it's the Russians.

54:22.400 --> 54:24.360
No, I believe it's speaking to China.

54:24.360 --> 54:25.360
Don't you know that?

54:25.360 --> 54:26.360
Oh yeah, you're right.

54:26.360 --> 54:27.360
It's nowhere Russia now.

54:27.360 --> 54:28.360
You're right.

54:28.360 --> 54:29.360
Sorry, it's Russia now.

54:29.360 --> 54:30.360
Get with the times.

54:30.360 --> 54:31.360
I know, it's hard to keep track.

54:31.360 --> 54:32.360
Or it could be North Korea.

54:32.360 --> 54:33.360
Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely.

54:33.360 --> 54:35.600
Yeah, I really see nothing.

54:35.600 --> 54:36.600
You're right.

54:36.600 --> 54:38.320
That is so weird.

54:38.320 --> 54:42.240
Anyway, FireJail looks like a pretty cool tool, even if producer Michael has me now

54:42.240 --> 54:43.240
freaked out.

54:43.240 --> 54:46.960
Now that we've gone all conspiracy, can I completely derail us?

54:46.960 --> 54:47.960
Yeah.

54:47.960 --> 54:51.240
I would like to mention that currently, Deb Comp 17 is going on.

54:51.240 --> 54:52.240
Yeah, right now.

54:52.240 --> 54:55.520
In our Canadian to the North area in Montreal.

54:55.520 --> 54:57.200
I wonder if Alan Jude's gonna go.

54:57.200 --> 54:58.200
Something tells me he'll probably miss that one.

54:58.200 --> 55:02.040
It started on Sunday, but it goes until the 12th.

55:02.040 --> 55:03.040
That's very long.

55:03.040 --> 55:06.560
And if there are some streams going on there too, but don't go, don't leave, oh God, oh

55:06.560 --> 55:08.040
God, we shouldn't, oh God.

55:08.040 --> 55:09.840
Watch directly after.

55:09.840 --> 55:11.560
I wonder if they'll post them somewhere.

55:11.560 --> 55:12.560
After TechSnap.

55:12.560 --> 55:14.440
I don't know if they already do that.

55:14.440 --> 55:15.440
Yeah.

55:15.440 --> 55:16.440
I wonder.

55:16.440 --> 55:20.240
On the Meetings DB on the video page, can post it and I'll see.

55:20.240 --> 55:21.600
I might go check that out then.

55:21.600 --> 55:24.440
That could be some good stuff in there.

55:24.440 --> 55:26.320
I'd love to go to something like that one time.

55:26.320 --> 55:27.320
I gotta get my passport.

55:27.320 --> 55:28.680
I really gotta get my crap together on that.

55:28.680 --> 55:30.520
So they still have four days to go.

55:30.520 --> 55:34.560
Oddcamp is also, we should give the guys for Oddcamp a plug, because that's coming up like

55:34.560 --> 55:35.560
super soon.

55:35.560 --> 55:37.640
I don't know what their ticket situation is or none of that.

55:37.640 --> 55:44.920
I got no affiliation with them, but Oddcamp 17 is going on August 19th and August 20th

55:44.920 --> 55:45.920
in Canterbury.

55:45.920 --> 55:50.400
So, and look, it's proudly sponsored by Intraware.

55:50.400 --> 55:54.320
You might check it out because they're selling, they still have tickets for sale on the website.

55:54.320 --> 55:55.320
And so that's coming up as well.

55:55.320 --> 55:57.600
Actually, the tickets are free.

55:57.600 --> 56:00.300
You can optionally, it's pay what you want.

56:00.300 --> 56:06.360
So you can either get a free ticket and not pay or you can pay every year we've done this.

56:06.360 --> 56:12.760
But if you choose to pay, then that money goes towards funding the event.

56:12.760 --> 56:19.800
And usually the community that optionally donates actually qualifies for like gold level

56:19.800 --> 56:23.320
sponsorship because they all throw in enough money.

56:23.320 --> 56:24.600
It works out quite well.

56:24.600 --> 56:26.180
Well, there you go.

56:26.180 --> 56:31.000
So you can find out more at oddcamp.org if you're near Canterbury.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.000
What about you, Poppy?

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
Are you going to make it?

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
I'm not sure.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.520
I've got a whole lot of family stuff going on that weekend, so I may, I may not.

56:37.520 --> 56:38.920
It might be a last minute thing.

56:38.920 --> 56:40.680
Isn't that always the way it goes?

56:40.680 --> 56:44.600
You have nothing for like three weeks and then boom, everything on that one event.

56:44.600 --> 56:45.600
It all hits at once.

56:45.600 --> 56:47.920
Joe from Linux Action News is going to be there.

56:47.920 --> 56:48.920
Yep.

56:48.920 --> 56:49.920
Yep.

56:49.920 --> 56:50.920
I'm definitely not going.

56:50.920 --> 56:51.920
Okay.

56:51.920 --> 56:55.200
I definitely would love to be able to go to next year's.

56:55.200 --> 56:58.000
That's kind of like a personal milestone is like, get my crap together.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.200
The problem is I got to go get my passport and it's, you can't just like submit a picture,

57:01.200 --> 57:02.200
go online and order it.

57:02.200 --> 57:06.000
Like you got to go to like two or so different physical locations, like three times.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
I don't know.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.280
It's a damn process and ain't nobody got time for that.

57:09.280 --> 57:10.920
Chris got no time for processes.

57:10.920 --> 57:12.880
They want Americans leaving Chris.

57:12.880 --> 57:16.520
I haven't even gotten my oil change into my truck for like 4,000 miles overdue.

57:16.520 --> 57:18.800
When am I going to get time to go get my passport done?

57:18.800 --> 57:23.000
And you got to go get a picture taken somewhere, we're on some crappy camera, give me a break.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.360
But I'll get around to it and then hopefully I'll make it to Oddcamp 18.

57:25.360 --> 57:27.280
Can that Alice bot help you with that?

57:27.280 --> 57:29.080
No doubt.

57:29.080 --> 57:30.760
That would be good.

57:30.760 --> 57:38.400
I really just need like a clone or I need somebody to create like the Mycroft AI system

57:38.400 --> 57:42.980
instead of Mycroft developing their own AI, they need to create an AI framework in which

57:42.980 --> 57:49.400
it can watch all of the Jupiter broadcasting content in its totality and then synthesize

57:49.400 --> 57:55.600
a version of me based on its observations, which would probably be a little extreme,

57:55.600 --> 57:56.680
but okay.

57:56.680 --> 58:03.080
And then make decisions for me automatically online, like pay bills, respond to emails,

58:03.080 --> 58:04.720
then I'd have time to go out and get my passport.

58:04.720 --> 58:09.640
So Mycroft should pivot and work on that, create an AI framework that analyzes an individual

58:09.640 --> 58:14.180
and then recreates their personality and then it gets close enough where it can make decisions

58:14.180 --> 58:15.180
for them.

58:15.180 --> 58:16.800
Isn't that already what Google's doing?

58:16.800 --> 58:19.160
I feel like they're doing that on the back end for ads and stuff.

58:19.160 --> 58:20.160
Yeah.

58:20.160 --> 58:23.400
We just need somebody doing that in the open source space, we're behind.

58:23.400 --> 58:24.720
I don't want to think anymore.

58:24.720 --> 58:25.720
Yeah.

58:25.720 --> 58:26.720
Somebody needs to do it.

58:26.720 --> 58:28.040
Just somebody just, yeah, yeah.

58:28.040 --> 58:29.040
Beans with hair.

58:29.040 --> 58:30.040
Exactly.

58:30.040 --> 58:31.040
That's all I want.

58:31.040 --> 58:32.040
Make it even call it beans.

58:32.040 --> 58:37.560
Well, they should change it to beans and it'll be the bean system.

58:37.560 --> 58:38.560
Anybody with me?

58:38.560 --> 58:39.560
Nobody?

58:39.560 --> 58:40.560
Nobody?

58:40.560 --> 58:41.560
I'm just out on my own on this one, huh?

58:41.560 --> 58:42.560
Okay.

58:42.560 --> 58:43.560
Good enough.

58:43.560 --> 58:44.560
Well, let's talk about Ting then.

58:44.560 --> 58:45.920
Everybody right now, linux.ting.com.

58:45.920 --> 58:46.920
Everybody loves Ting.

58:46.920 --> 58:50.600
Go there and get yourself a mobile device that you only pay for what you use.

58:50.600 --> 58:55.220
It's just $6 for the line, there's no crazy contracts, no agreements, quote unquote.

58:55.220 --> 59:00.600
It's just pay for what you use, a fair price, nationwide coverage, with a great dashboard,

59:00.600 --> 59:02.320
$6 for the line.

59:02.320 --> 59:03.840
And no magic beans involved.

59:03.840 --> 59:04.840
No.

59:04.840 --> 59:08.920
I mean, maybe if those are your own, but that's not Ting's thing.

59:08.920 --> 59:09.920
That's your own thing.

59:09.920 --> 59:10.920
That's how you go.

59:10.920 --> 59:15.320
You go to linux.ting.com to get $25 off a device if you want to buy one from Ting.

59:15.320 --> 59:19.520
Or if you bring one, check their BYOD page because they have a CDMA and GSM network.

59:19.520 --> 59:24.280
So you can bring quite a bit of devices, a lot of low powered IoT devices work with that

59:24.280 --> 59:25.280
too.

59:25.280 --> 59:27.640
It's pretty slick for $6 a month.

59:27.640 --> 59:30.280
And also while you're there, linux.ting.com, check out their blog.

59:30.280 --> 59:35.560
They got a solid post right now on fiber optic internet and talking about the future infrastructure

59:35.560 --> 59:36.560
of America.

59:36.560 --> 59:38.680
And I like the argument that they make here.

59:38.680 --> 59:39.680
It's pretty solid.

59:39.680 --> 59:43.720
They included an embedded video with one of their executives.

59:43.720 --> 59:46.980
It's all pretty nice and it's pretty good talking points for yourself too.

59:46.980 --> 59:47.980
Check it out.

59:47.980 --> 59:48.980
Go to linux.ting.com.

59:48.980 --> 59:50.680
Learn more about Ting.

59:50.680 --> 59:51.880
Just a smarter way to do mobile.

59:51.880 --> 59:55.520
It's really how they'd have to do mobile in the US today if they were to start over, if

59:55.520 --> 59:56.520
the industry had to reboot.

59:56.520 --> 59:57.640
They'd have to do it this way.

59:57.640 --> 59:59.120
Nobody would accept anything else.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.440
Once you switch, it's everything else looks so crazy complicated.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.440
It's really nice.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.440
linux.ting.com.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.160
Thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.160
linux.ting.com.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:12.480
I tell you what, Chris, I might have to look at their phone shop soon because this phone

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.120
is not doing so hot.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.320
Really is it starting to give out on you?

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.560
Well, I stopped reading the SIM the other day when it got really warm.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.560
Oh, that's right.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.560
Yeah.

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.040
And Chris has been having problems with his Nexus 6.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.040
Is that right?

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:28.520
He's going to give us an update on the next user, but he's been doing some ROM hopping.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.520
So that's kind of interesting.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.920
I've been doing some distro hopping.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.120
Tried out Slackware this week.

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:37.480
What an experience it was too.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.480
So I'd never done it.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.040
I'd always, you know, by the time I got into Linux, SUSE was already a thing.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.840
So I just skipped right over Slackware and I went with SUSE.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:48.120
And then later Red Hat and Mandrake and all those.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.120
Gen 2.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.120
Of course.

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.000
So Slackware is one of the OG Linux.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.080
It's the oldest distribution that's still being maintained.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.080
It's 24 years old.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:59.400
We should have shown one of those charts of all the distro history.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.400
Yeah, right.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.400
Right.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.400
Yeah, no kidding.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.400
You can find them though.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.400
It started in 1993.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.720
It was originally based on Soft Landing Linux system.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.080
Slackware has been the basis for a bunch of other distributions as well, like SUSE, like

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.660
I just mentioned.

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:18.240
Its initial release was July 17th, 1993.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:25.320
The version we tried out today, version 14.2, was released on June 30th, 2016.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:28.800
So it's just over a year old by just a couple of days.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.800
So the release that Wes and I have been running is just over a year old.

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.880
Came out last June.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:38.000
So I thought let's start with the installation because it is very much an old school type

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Linux.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.880
It really took me back actually to early days of Debian to some degree too.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:45.520
You boot, in this case I booted from a USB disk.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:49.200
I tried to get the CDs, but I just didn't have enough time for them to make it for the

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.200
show.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.340
And it's like a six disk set, which is adorable.

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:53.600
Or you can get one big DVD.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:59.640
So I got the DVD USB image, flashed that to a thumb drive, and I booted my system.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:03.080
When it boots up, it immediately drops you to just a login prompt.

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.080
The installer does.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:07.280
You just go to a login prompt, and you are prompted to log in as root.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.000
So it just tells you to log in as root.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.200
You hit root, and it just logs you in.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.840
There's no password.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:17.480
And then it tells you with the message of the day to type in setup.

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.760
Or to run fdisk and start partitioning your crap.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.960
A little bit like the Arch installer in that way.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:23.960
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:27.600
And so you can, you know, there's various ways you can set up your partition schemes.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.000
You can do it manually before you launch the installer.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.880
Or you just type in setup, and it launches the Slackware setup.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.880
Here's the important part, Chris.

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:36.880
Does it support ButterFS?

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:42.600
I actually don't think I did see ButterFS.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:47.520
It was really almost immediately at this point, I was left feeling, this is already something

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:51.800
that all of the other Linux distributions literally solved 10 years ago.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:56.880
And that was, they took the installer, and they removed as many steps that were not necessary.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.280
Like making me log in when I only have one login option, and there's no password.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:02.360
Just log in for me.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:05.400
There's nothing else I can do, so just log in for me.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:09.960
If I can either only partition my disk, or start the setup, just ask me which one of

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.520
those things I want to do, and then do it.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:15.760
Or at least it could be a little more explicit in that, like, that part especially, like,

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.480
I don't mind a few simple steps, but that part was confusing because, like...

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.480
You just drop to a terminal.

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.760
And it doesn't even say that there's no password.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.120
You just have to, you find out, you hit enter, and you're like, okay, it worked, great, but...

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.680
Yeah, you had no idea.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.280
Maybe it's just a step to get rid of all the noobs.

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.280
It almost worked.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.280
It's a new filter.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.280
Yeah, almost.

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:35.640
But it seems like modern Linux has worked out those unneeded steps.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:38.880
This again, it feels more like Linux from another time.

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.280
In a way, that feels kind of good, too, though.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.280
It does, yeah.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.280
It's not all bad.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:46.360
It uses an old-school Ncurses installer, which has always worked really well for me.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:50.080
I've never had a problem with Ncurses UIs.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.640
Simple works on pretty much anything.

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.280
You can do it over VGA.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:58.040
And I did the option, I wonder if you did this, too, where it says, what packages would

01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.040
you like?

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:01.960
And one of them is just install everything.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:02.960
Recommended.

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:03.960
Yeah, it is in...

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.520
Yes, I did, which that itself was...

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.400
This is totally...

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:11.480
It also feels like a different time, a different era, and it's kind of nice.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.640
Yeah, so I did the same thing.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.920
I installed all the things.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:18.620
Then the thing I liked at the end of the installation, which I wish all Linux installers, like at

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:22.200
least maybe give me a checkbox at the beginning to turn this option on, is it prompted me

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:25.080
to create a USB boot stick that was like your...

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.080
That was interesting.

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.680
Yeah, here's your rescue USB stick.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:30.960
You create this, and if you can't get your system to boot, dummy, put this USB stick

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.040
in and we'll take you right to the root of your file system.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.180
And I was like, that's a great idea.

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.680
Every Linux distro should offer that.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.680
Yeah.

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.680
So I like that aspect of it.

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:40.680
Did you do that?

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:41.680
No.

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:42.680
I skipped it as well.

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.680
That's a great idea that I'm not going to use.

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:47.920
Well, because I only had the one USB on me that had the Slack one, and I was like, well,

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.100
if this doesn't go well, I'm going to need to do it again.

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:54.640
So what you guys were saying is that you came to Slack not ready to play with Linux.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.360
Well, I'm only using it for the week.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.360
I knew I wasn't going to be sticking around.

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.480
If I had been installing it with a DVD and then I had a flash, or if I just had a second

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.760
flash drive, which I think was just in a different bag.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.800
So did you get X, did you go all the way up to X and do a desktop?

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.800
I got KDE on there.

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.800
Did you?

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.800
I went with Mate.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.800
Oh, see, that's nice.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.800
Yeah, it was.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:13.800
It actually was.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:14.800
It was just fine.

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:19.560
And I'm not such a Mate connoisseur that I can't tell a super old version of Mate from

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.560
a...

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.800
I can tell it's an older version, but I can't tell how out of date it is.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:23.800
So to me, it's like, that's fine.

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:24.800
This works.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:25.800
This is doing the job.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.400
Well, you just missed the new super key hotness.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.640
That's the only thing I knew.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:34.880
I got a little antsy pretty quick when it came to software availability.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:38.880
And at first, I ran into like, God, all these packages in the repo are so damn old, and

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.880
all this stuff is just too ancient.

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:41.960
I can't use this.

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.400
It was nice, though, to like...

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.320
It was so strange to have all the things.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.320
You know what I mean?

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:49.920
There was just like nine gigs of software that I already had, building things.

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:53.160
I don't need to install any build dependencies because they're all there.

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.160
Yeah.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.120
But I pretty soon found myself coming across slackbuilds.org.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.120
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.120
Did you go to Slack Builds?

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.120
Yeah.

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.120
That's how I got Chrome.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.120
I got Slack on there.

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.120
Oh, you did, huh?

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.120
Which Slack for Slack was kind of hard to search for.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.120
Yeah.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:06.120
That is funny.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.120
That is the modern terminology, dude.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.120
Actually, I took...

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.120
I didn't see...

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:10.120
So they have Chromium on there.

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:14.640
They don't have Chrome, but I was able to take the Slack Build script for Slack because

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:18.760
it's just both Chrome and Slack give you a deb, and I just converted it.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.360
So now that I made one for Chrome.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:21.360
So this is...

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.360
So let's talk about this for a second.

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:29.200
So Slack Build.org is pretty cool, Slack Builds, I should say, Builds with an S,.org.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.700
They say their goal is to have the largest collection of Slack Build scripts, which Slack

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:38.520
Build scripts is the very mechanism that Slack is put together with, Slackware is put together

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.520
with.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.360
They want to have the largest collection of Slack Build scripts available while still

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.920
ensuring that they are of the highest quality.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:48.200
So they test every submission prior to including the repository.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.200
Nice.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:54.500
So it's not that this is a repository of software, but it's a repository of Slack Builds that

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:58.640
link out to other software and they QA them before they list them in the directory.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.640
That's pretty handy to have.

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:02.040
I mean, the ones I use, they did just work.

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.320
It's curated build scripts.

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.320
Yeah.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.320
And that...

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.320
I'm like, okay.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.320
All right.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.320
I can...

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.640
Especially since you already have a bunch of the dependencies and they kind of know what

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.640
those are.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.000
It seems pretty...

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.040
It's less of a moving target than the AUR maybe.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.040
Yeah.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.040
I...

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.040
Oh, go ahead.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:20.000
I was going to say it's like a higher quality AUR because it's getting testing.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Yeah.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.800
And it's more focused in some degree.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:27.720
And there's some stuff, like I said, like Firefox is still not the latest in there.

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:35.880
So I thought a lot about who Slackware is for and if there is a space for like an Antigros

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.440
equivalent of Slackware.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.480
Is there room for that?

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.640
Is there room for a Mangero equivalent of Slackware?

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:45.160
I looked around a little bit and I did find a Salix, I think is how you say, S-A-L-I.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.160
Salix or Salix.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.160
Salix.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.160
Yeah.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:51.960
Which is a distribution based on Slackware that is simple, fast and easy to use.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:54.160
They say stability is their primary goal.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.400
It's fully backwards compatible Slackware, so Slackware users can benefit from the Salix

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.360
repositories which is kind of neat.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:03.720
They can also use extra quality source software for their...

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.360
They can use it as an extra quality source.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.480
It's available in several different...

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:13.760
They have a Matea version, they have an XFCE version of Fluxbox, Openbox.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.680
I don't see KDE on here though.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:20.980
So they have several different versions, 32-bit and 64-bit, and it's sort of like an easy

01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:26.040
face for Slackware, which I don't really know if there's a market for, because it seems

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.040
like...

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:31.000
Well, but why is there a market for that in Arch and not Slack?

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:37.720
I feel like Arch is more new Linux.

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:44.800
So there's more, when your market is new Linux, then you also have a bunch of new users that

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:47.660
are looking for an easy on-ramp to that, I think, maybe.

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:48.660
So I was...

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:50.400
Okay, from the new user angle, I can see that.

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:51.400
Yeah.

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:55.720
Because here's where I was going with this, is to answer your question, I think it'd be

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.940
better to answer, well, who is Slackware for, like as a desktop?

01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:01.080
Who is Slackware for as a desktop user?

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:04.200
And I think that's a little bit of a different question.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:08.720
And I did some thinking as I was using Slackware about this, trying to get an idea of like,

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.720
who would I recommend this to?

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:19.560
And it struck me that there's several different analogies you could make, but I like the analogy

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:23.440
that there are simple cars versus easy-to-use cars.

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.840
The easy-to-use car will have cruise control, it'll have power steering, it'll have power

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:32.800
brakes, it's going to have like climate control, like my truck even has individual zone climate

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:38.520
control, powered mirrors, automated sunroof, these kinds of things that are really easy

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:39.520
to use.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.600
And it has like some sort of voice control system.

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.440
The simple car doesn't have any of that.

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:48.560
Maybe it has manual windows, it has really basic steering, maybe it's a manual stick,

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.120
it's not some fancy six-speed automatic.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.440
Now you're talking my language.

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.440
Right?

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:54.940
It's got like, it's just windows that you just pull open and pull closed.

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:57.600
But the thing is, they never break.

01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.980
They literally just will operate.

01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:05.080
You see these cars from the 80s and earlier that are just simple built that are on the

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:08.120
road still.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:12.680
And it's funny, Mike, my RV has a huge truck engine in it.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:18.640
And because it's in a different market, it's actually simpler to look under the hood of

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:23.480
my RV and do work on my RV than it is my truck, because my truck's like a more modern, quote-unquote

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.440
easy-to-use vehicle.

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:28.020
And this is where I see ARCH.

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:31.680
The simple car is just reliable, solid, it's exactly what you expect.

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.880
The easy-to-use car with the automatic transition is going to have more problems.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:39.740
There's no automatic anything in Slackware.

01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:43.600
If both cars are priced around the same, which in Linux that is true, most people would probably

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:48.800
just take the easy-to-use car, which is why things like Ubuntu and ARCH and Red Hat obviously

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:49.800
are larger than Slack.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:53.080
You're calling ARCH easy-to-use right here on the public, look at that.

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.860
When you use Anagros and stuff, yeah.

01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:59.000
And I think it's probably easier to manage software on ARCH.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
But yeah.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.520
Well, I mean, if you want new things, I would say Slack's easier to just get up and, like,

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.200
if you installed it with a graphical GUI.

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.260
I guess that's where I see, like, the GUI part is, like, if you had an Anagros installer

01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:12.880
for Slack, you could just do that and then not touch it.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:16.880
If you had that, like, if you get a modern OBS from Slack builds and then just leave

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:19.680
that running, I think that'd be a very stable system.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.680
Yeah.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:23.560
Yeah, I mean, the thing about Slackware, too, is that it's good to build on top of it, it'd

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:28.200
be good to deploy somewhere that you just want to put in a corner and have run forever.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:33.120
People who value reliability, maintainability, modifiability, I guess, is that a word?

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.420
Am I making up a word there?

01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:37.760
And predictability, too, with Slack, I would say, with Slackware.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.920
I'd say predictability as well.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:44.080
I'd say those are people that would be well-positioned to use Slack.

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.840
So are we going to use Slack in the studio?

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:47.840
That's just...

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:48.840
No, it's not my cup of tea.

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:49.840
It never has been.

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:50.840
That's why I was never particularly drawn to it.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:51.840
I don't have any criticisms of it.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:52.840
It's just not my cup of tea.

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:57.040
But what was interesting to me was that it felt like it was kind of like I use a little

01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:01.680
bit of CentOS, Ubuntu, and Arch really as my daily driver between work and personal

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:02.800
life.

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:04.920
And by and large, the conventions are pretty similar.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:08.840
Like Ubuntu obviously has the Debian heritage, so it does things from Debian ways and Etsy

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.880
alternatives, all that stuff.

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:11.880
But most of it's the same.

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:12.880
Slack was different.

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:13.880
Yeah.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:16.640
The default paths for users, the root were different.

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.160
I was trying to get it up like...

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.720
This is the first time I've ever used Lilo.

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:22.720
How do you...

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:23.720
Oh, right.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:24.720
Yeah.

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:25.720
Yeah, it's...

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:26.720
Oh, man, I haven't used Lilo in ages.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.560
So I accidentally hit don't install it when I rebooted.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:30.560
Oh, really?

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:31.560
So props to Slack.

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:35.440
Slack is like the easiest thing to boot because by default, it uses a huge kernel that has

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.280
all the modules built into it.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.280
And so I just...

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:41.480
I Kexec'd from Arch, but you don't have to have a kernel command link.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:47.360
All I did was say like root is dev SDA 4, and then I hit Kexec, and it just rebooted

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:50.400
right into Slack.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:54.640
But what I noticed trying to get like trying to get it set up through like a chroot or

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:59.160
system dnspawn was that like some things are just different, like on their kernels where

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:04.400
the EFI variables are different path under slash sys than on Arch, and different where

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.400
all the executables live.

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.640
I wonder if they would be the same as they are in SUSE, because I've noticed that's true

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.640
when I use SUSE too.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.640
Oh, interesting.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:10.640
Sometimes some of those things are different than they are.

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.960
So it's really just a lot of fun to be of a different heritage in Linux because it's

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:14.960
like...

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:15.960
It does feel like a different lineage.

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.960
There's so much that we take for granted when a lot of the things that we have are

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:21.600
not Linux or even GNU Linux by default, it's just modern convention.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:26.520
I would tell you, I would say too, there was a genuine sense of nostalgia when I was using

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:29.640
it, which is almost worth just doing for that.

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:35.640
If you enjoy like looking back at older hardware and a different era of computing when things

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:41.460
were a little different, but also you had more control, it made me feel nostalgic.

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:43.800
And so I enjoyed using it just for that.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:48.680
In fact, I would love to take this even further and get like an old computer running with

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:52.040
Slackware on there and do the full install, like I would have done back in the day when

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.040
I was on a dial-up connection.

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:57.400
Like I would much rather take a Slack laptop than an Arch laptop on a plane, if you're

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.360
on a 12-hour flight or something.

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.360
It's true.

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.240
Or you're on a damn MiFi all the time like I am.

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.240
Right.

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:04.240
Yeah.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.180
And then go set up and get my Gopher client working and go get on Usenet.

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.720
So what did you think of...

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.940
How do you reconcile between Slack and Arch?

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:15.240
Because I feel like there's a lot that is sympathetic between them, the desire for simplicity

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:16.240
over ease.

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.240
The KISS principle.

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:18.240
But there's also...

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.640
They're very divergent in other ways.

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:20.640
Yeah.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:27.400
To me, Slackware would be perfect on an old Intel computer that I'm serving up web pages

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:31.360
for, and it's something that I don't want to touch for three years.

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:35.780
Arch is something that I'm touching several times a month minimum.

01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:37.280
That's where I draw the line.

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:41.040
So is Arch the hipster, got to have the new software version of Slack?

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:43.280
I've been avoiding that hipster word the entire time.

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:46.240
Yeah, but Rekai's used it like six times, so I'll use it once.

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:47.240
You don't have to say it.

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.240
Yeah.

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:53.480
I think your term there, Wes, that you have chosen to use at this juncture is probably

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:57.240
a close insinuation of what the potential possible situation should be.

01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.640
Or the difference between people who are trying out a lot of new software versus using the

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.440
same software that they know works.

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.440
Yeah.

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:08.800
New breed, hipster-y distro, and Slack is for the old graybeards.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:09.800
Yeah.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.800
That is one way to put it.

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:16.480
I also would actually say it could be a bit of a science history project for new Linux

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:17.480
users.

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:22.560
So say you're new to Linux in the last five years, and you want to know what it used to

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.240
be like for us Linux users that have been around since the 90s.

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:27.240
Give this a spin.

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:31.940
It gives you a taste of it without having to actually really sit there and load it from

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:34.840
floppy disks and really grind it out.

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:35.840
Yeah.

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.360
And you'll get a new appreciation for grub.

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:38.360
Yeah.

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:39.360
That's true.

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.240
I tell you, Lilo is fast as hell, though.

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:44.360
Man, it was great seeing Lilo again.

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:45.660
Talk about making me nostalgic.

01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:49.760
Just seeing words on an end-curses screen, seeing Lilo on an end-curses screen, it just

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:50.760
made me...

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.760
That was good times.

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:53.760
It was worth it just for that.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.280
It was worth it for the Lilo.

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.880
You rekindled that relationship with that old girlfriend.

01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:58.880
Yeah.

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.280
It was like going to a high school reunion, literally.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:04.040
It was like literally going to my high school reunion.

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:06.160
That's about how long it goes.

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.160
So here's a question.

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.160
What?

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:13.480
Are you willing to try another older style distro, but that includes some newer concepts?

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:19.320
I mean, sort of, I'm kind of ready to start on my personal journey of picking the distro

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:20.320
for me.

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.320
You're ready to start settling again.

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:22.320
Yeah.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:23.320
Well, this can be a separate thing.

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.320
Okay.

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.320
What do you got?

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.320
So there's this distro called Crux.

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.320
Oh, yeah.

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:28.320
Oh, yeah.

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:29.320
We've talked about it.

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.320
Yeah.

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:31.640
It's a BSD file system, right?

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:37.480
Well, the thing I noticed about it is that it uses a ports package system.

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:38.540
Like the port system?

01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:39.540
Like the BSD port system?

01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:40.540
I'm not sure.

01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:41.540
It says ports.

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:45.640
Crux is a lightweight x86-64 optimized Linux distribution, targeted to experienced Linux

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:50.960
users, delivered by a tar.gz-based package system with the BSD style init scripts.

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:52.960
It's not based on the other Linux distribution.

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:56.000
It also utilizes a port system to install and upgrade applications.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.520
If I recall, it was an inspiration for Arch back in the day, right?

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.640
And maybe even some of the original Arch people worked on it, I think.

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:07.360
Well, you know, so they had a server failure.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.360
It says tomorrow.

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:09.360
Yeah.

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.360
Okay.

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.360
Inspired by Crux.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.360
How is that possible?

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.360
Isn't that 2000?

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.360
No.

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:15.360
No.

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.360
No.

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.360
That's European style dating, isn't it?

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.360
Isn't that...

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.360
So the month is in the middle?

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.360
July 9th.

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:21.360
Yeah.

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.360
Okay.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.360
July 9th.

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.360
Okay.

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:25.360
All right.

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:29.120
So during the week of July 9th, they had a server downtime.

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.120
That's the last...

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:31.120
It looks like...

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:32.120
Oh, okay.

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:33.120
Here we go.

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.600
February, they released Crux 3.3 of this year.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:37.600
So the project's still active.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:40.800
Yeah, I'd be willing to give it a go.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.360
I suppose if the audience wants us to.

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:46.820
I mean, I don't want to sit there and blow my week if people aren't actually interested

01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:49.720
in Crux, but I'd be willing to give it a go if people want to let us know.

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:51.160
Let us know in the comments.

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:54.140
You know, I'll watch for the first couple of days, and if we see people saying, give

01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:57.480
it a go in the comments, and they want to hear what using Crux is like, I'll do it.

01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:58.480
I don't know.

01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:02.000
I kind of like the idea of us just looking at some of these more esoteric distros.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.080
Going back in time, in a sense.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.240
That are maybe not the most mainstream things.

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:08.880
I actually think this is something that open source is uniquely good at, because the source

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:12.480
code sticks around, like when proprietary software has a new version, the old version

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.480
dies.

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:14.480
Yep.

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:15.480
Yeah.

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:17.080
Once it's no longer hosted on their site, and no one has an archive of it, it's dead.

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:18.080
Yeah, right.

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:20.400
But with open source, you can still get the old stuff, you can still build it.

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:27.560
We can look at some of these sideline distros, and find out what they do good that the main

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.840
guys aren't doing, and maybe highlight that.

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:30.840
Yeah.

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.880
I mean, I do think that is a common trend in our world, is like, things succeed partly

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:37.800
by technocratic merit, and partly by momentum.

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:41.400
And there's a lot of things, I think, in particular, we would say about Unix, perhaps.

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:44.960
That old ideas, some that were old and weren't modernized, but that have very good principles

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:48.640
or ideas that just haven't, that are yet to be mined by the new mainstream.

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.440
Hmm, that's very true.

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:56.280
Mubbleroam, any passing or closing thoughts on Slackware, or old Linux, before we wrap

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:57.880
up for the day?

01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:02.840
Going once, going twice, yeah, okay.

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:07.900
That's about, that sentiment right there is about, I would expect the overall actual interest

01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:08.900
in Slackware.

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:11.040
I actually had a lot of fun on the Slackware challenge.

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.040
I'm glad that we did it.

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.040
Yeah, me too.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.040
I really enjoyed it.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.040
I don't think it'll be in my life.

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.040
Now I can say I've used it.

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.840
Like, I don't expect to continue to use it.

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:22.200
I think that probably if I was going to go off Arch, something like Solus, Gentoo even,

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:24.640
I would do a Gentoo challenge, like 2017 new style.

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.040
Oh my god, now that's a can of worms.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.040
Oh my.

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.040
I don't know if you're interested in that.

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.440
And on that bombshell, I say we...

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:33.440
All right, all right, coward.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:36.840
All right, I mean, I'm down for it.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:37.840
Win, win.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:41.520
We can pick a good time for both of us, but next week would be fine.

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:46.640
All right, so next week, let us know in crux, next week, it's going to be the Gentoo challenge.

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:47.640
I'm down for that.

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.040
I'm down for that.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.040
Wow.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.120
It's been a long time.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.720
It's been a long time since I ran Gentoo Mumble Room.

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.200
Thank you guys very much for making it here.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.120
I really appreciate having you guys.

01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.600
You can join us live to jblive.tv.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.560
We do it on Sundays at 2pm Pacific.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:03.840
Go to jubilabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your local time.

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:09.280
And you can send us your feedback at jubilabroadcasting.com slash contact and unplug dot reddit dot com

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:26.560
and jubilabroadcasting.com slash telegram.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:47.120
The Discord Alliance grows.

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:50.840
The Discord Alliance, discord.me slash Jupiter Colony.

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:51.840
More and more people getting in there.

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:55.560
The haircare channel, we mentioned that recently, is getting some attention.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.880
Yeah, there you go, there you go.

01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:58.880
Also the first place I actually-

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:04.880
I honestly thought haircare was about, let's talk about big beards and grooming and stuff

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:05.880
like that.

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:08.480
You know, beard, you know, that wouldn't be bad actually.

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.000
I also kind of think we should create a Rick and Morty channel because-

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Oh my gosh, no kidding.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.840
I got so much Rick and Morty to talk about.

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:14.840
Really?

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:15.840
Oh man.

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:16.840
Anytime.

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:17.840
Anytime.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:18.840
I'm your guy.

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:19.840
Yeah?

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:20.840
I love it.

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:21.840
Have you seen Pickle Rick?

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:22.840
Of course I've seen Pickle Rick!

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:23.840
Watched it the night it came out.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:24.840
What do you think I am, some barbarian?

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:25.840
So good.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:26.840
Who's not obsessed with the show?

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:27.840
I love it.

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.840
I love it.

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:30.840
Firefox is on fire.

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:34.600
There was something I said at the end, like I was in it for the Lilo or something like

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:35.600
that.

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:36.600
That could also be a good title.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.240
What did I say?

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:43.080
So I honestly remember news like from several years ago when EFI was becoming popular and

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.000
Lilo was like going to be dropped.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.040
So I guess they eventually did add EFI support to it and I suppose that's the only way it's

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.040
used these days.

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:56.000
We could do some wordplay and be like Lilo with Slackware.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.920
I was in it for the Lilo is too long.

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:03.400
I was in it for Lilo.

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:04.400
They had me at Lilo.

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:05.400
How about that?

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:06.960
Yeah, that's not bad.

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:08.760
That's L-I-L-O, right?

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:09.760
Yeah.

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:14.120
L-I-L-O and it's all uppercase L-I-L-O, right?

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:15.120
That's technically it's all uppercase.

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.120
Linux loader.

01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:19.480
Yeah, you guys are going to do Gentoo but you're not going to get the real experience

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:22.280
because they do stage three installs now.

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:24.360
Well, we don't have to do stage three.

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.640
No one said we had to do stage three.

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.600
Yeah, but it's not recommended anymore to not use stage three.

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:32.600
I used to actually always do a stage two install.

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:33.600
So is Lilo…

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:37.720
I do a stage two when I install Ubuntu.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.240
Lilo and Stitch is…

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:43.820
It's funny because I was a Gentoo user, the way I backed into Ubuntu is I would always

01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:47.880
install the Ubuntu server version and then install the desktop meta package on top of

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:48.880
it.

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.920
That was always because I didn't want to use the live CD.

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:54.500
I wanted to use the command… because that's how you install a Linux and then I eventually

01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:56.360
backed out of that.

01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:57.360
Weirdo.

01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.800
I know.

01:22:58.800 --> 01:22:59.800
So what is it?

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:01.840
What is the capital L-I-L-O?

01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:02.840
Is that the…

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:03.840
Okay, good.

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:04.840
It is.

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:05.840
All up case.

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:06.840
Yeah.

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.320
It was throwing me off when I searched for it is Lilo and Stitch or whatever that cartoon

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.320
is.

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:13.880
I was also… it's kind of… it's nice to boot without a… in it ramfs too.

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.240
That was nice of Slack.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:16.240
Yes.

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:19.680
The other thing that I haven't had to answer in a long time is what resolution do you want

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:20.680
to run your console at?

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:21.680
I hadn't had to answer…

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:22.680
And all the font choices?

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:23.680
Did you spend some time playing with those?

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:24.680
Yeah.

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:25.680
That's a good time.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:29.800
That is like warning, there's a safe choice here and there's also a version that might

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.480
make it so your consoles don't work.

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:34.800
So pick carefully.

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:35.800
Nobody loves… what?

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:36.800
Nobody likes Had Me at Lilo?

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.760
What's the matter with you guys?

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:40.120
That's good.

01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.600
You Had Me at Lilo is good.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.080
We could do Lilo and Slack.

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:46.720
Lilo and Slack.

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:48.960
Lilo you complete me.

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:49.960
Lilo and Slack.

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.840
You Had Me at Lilo I think is pretty good though.

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:55.920
I mean, but also the other one that's winning right now is Defecating Butter FS.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:01.960
That's great.
