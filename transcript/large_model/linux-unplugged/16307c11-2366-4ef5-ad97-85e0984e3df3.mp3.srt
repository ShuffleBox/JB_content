00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 29 for February 25th, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that just put it all out there this week.

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
My name is Chris.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
My name is Matt.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hey there, Matt. I'm totally pumped up. We've got a special guest in studio right now. Hey there, Chase.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hey, guys.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hey, Chase.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hey, how's it going?

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm glad you're here today.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hey, you know it's a beautiful day.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It really is.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And the best time to be doing a show is inside when it's a nice day.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah. Well, at least we have the window cracked so we can get like some sort of fresh air.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Have I told you how much I love this effin' jam?

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This song is Mr. Jankies.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Ronald Jankies is the man.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I know. That's why I have him on my boobs today.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's not the only reason. I mean, we're going to be talking about how to Linux and brainstorming with our mumble room.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You know, I figured if we're doing a show about Linux, why not have some of the preparation and some of the thought that goes into it

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and some of the logic and reasoning that goes into making a show out in the open too.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So essentially...

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Wait, no. Chris.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Our source is going to be out there.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Chris, not a good idea.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No?

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No, because then you're going to be spreading the secrets of the secret sauce.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That's true.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And then what's going to happen, Chris, is you're going to get these copycats.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
They're going to try to do...

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Chase, Chase, I've got to stop you right there.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't know. I don't know.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The secret sauce isn't in the mechanics.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Wait, what?

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's in the content.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh, yeah. That's right.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I know. I know.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I forgot about that.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Sometimes I forget that too.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What, content?

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah. Like this week.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Content's king.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Actually, I'm really actually kind of excited because we just got our first test challenge coin in.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh, my God. I felt it in my hands by the way.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I touched it.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I touched it.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
How did it feel, Chase?

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
How did it feel?

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It was hard, yet smooth, and it felt good to the touch.

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No, I'm talking about the coin.

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
How did the coin feel?

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh, the coin was great.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah.

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay.

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Thank you very much.

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So, if you guys didn't know, I don't know, maybe you live under a rock.

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's okay.

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I won't hold it against you.

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I just...

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Just a little judgey.

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No, I mean this coin, by the way, the picture doesn't...

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The coin comes with every last shirt.

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It does.

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Every last 300 shirts.

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
By the way, there's one thing that you're not seeing in this picture.

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What's that?

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The other side.

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The other side.

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Well, we're still perfecting the other side, but we're planning right now to have the Jupiter

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
broadcasting logo on the other side.

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's cooler than the other side of the pillow.

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Wow.

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's true though.

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I do agree with you.

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So, if you've gone over to teespring.com slash last 300 and ordered a shirt, you'll have

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
one of those there coins very soon.

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Each shirt comes with a coin until we get to too many shirts.

78
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
How much time is left on those shirts, Chris?

79
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Like two weeks.

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll go check right now.

81
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I was going to say, this is one of those things, you guys.

82
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Like 13 days, I think.

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Remember, there's not going to be another one of these shirts.

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Nope.

85
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This is it right here.

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This is a limited edition.

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
One week, five days.

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We've sold 673.

89
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We have a goal of 754 to unlock them.

90
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Now, here's the thing.

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The goal will be reached.

92
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You don't want to be left out.

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You think it will?

94
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, yeah.

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah, I think so at this point.

96
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You don't want to be left out because if you're left out...

97
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're not going to get a coin for one thing.

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You won't get a coin.

99
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Or a shirt.

100
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Or a shirt.

101
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah.

102
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And not only that, you don't want to be that guy at Linux Fest Northwest.

103
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh.

104
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If you're coming out.

105
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Because here's the thing.

106
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Or maybe just in public.

107
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Here's what a challenge...

108
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Do you guys know what a challenge coin is all about?

109
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah.

110
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm going to...

111
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Tell me right now.

112
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Go ahead.

113
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
All right.

114
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So let's say, for example, you're at a nice establishment to have some drinks.

115
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Let's say like a swanky beer joint where I walk in.

116
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
There's wood paneling everywhere pictured.

117
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Sicily, 1982.

118
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You've got dark mood lights, smoke in the atmosphere.

119
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I sit down with a gruff look on my face.

120
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You have former baristas that are now working the bar.

121
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Right.

122
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay.

123
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
All right.

124
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm picturing it right now.

125
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
All right.

126
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You got a nice picture in your head?

127
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah, it's great.

128
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Looks comfy.

129
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
All right.

130
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So some of your Linux buddies, they come in from the show.

131
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Right.

132
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You know, hey, they had a long day walking the floor.

133
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But how do they know it's really me?

134
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, they know the beard.

135
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, I mean, what if I shaved?

136
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, you're wearing the shirt.

137
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And my hair is messed up.

138
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You're wearing the shirt first off.

139
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay.

140
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That'd be a clue.

141
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So they walk over to you.

142
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
They say, hey, Chris.

143
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And you're like, hey, guys.

144
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hey.

145
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And you reach into your pocket.

146
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,320
And then you pull it out, the coin, and then you put it down and you slap it on the table.

147
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,240
What if you're that one guy that doesn't have the coin?

148
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
You know what happens to you?

149
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Oh, it's embarrassing.

150
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Do you know what happens to you?

151
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,240
No.

152
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,480
You're buying the drinks for the whole group.

153
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,560
That's what the challenge is.

154
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,320
The challenge is you need to have the coin.

155
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
I see.

156
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,560
So if I get a Jupiter broadcasting last 300 shirt and a challenge card, I'm actually saving

157
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
money.

158
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
You're saving money.

159
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Gotcha.

160
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
It is a benefit.

161
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
It is one of those things.

162
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Forget the healthcare.

163
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
We're going to start marketing, Chase.

164
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
That'd been great.

165
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,680
You're welcome.

166
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,840
So coming up on the show today, not only are we going to talk about how to Linux, but I

167
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,840
did an interview yesterday with Brendan, who is working on a new distro called Clementine

168
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,240
OS.

169
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
It's based on PerOS.

170
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,880
And if you might remember, PerOS was shut down after it was bought by another company,

171
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
shut down.

172
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,280
And then Clementine OS was sort of like the phoenix rising out of the ashes of PerOS.

173
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,440
And then it got into some legal trouble.

174
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,200
A lot of speculation, including was Apple behind it, was floating around the web.

175
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,120
We didn't cover it because we didn't know the whole story, but we got a chance to talk

176
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,920
with one of the guys behind that whole thing, so we're going to talk about that.

177
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,460
What I got from the interview, when I walked away from it, was like, oh, this is a warning

178
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,020
now that if you're thinking about getting into making your own distribution, there's

179
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,440
a whole new class of stuff you have to think about because of the size of the overall Linux

180
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
ecosystem.

181
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,160
I think, if nothing else, walking away from this interview, that's what I took with me,

182
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,680
so we'll play that in a little bit.

183
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,440
Now, as is perdition, gentlemen, we should start with our feedback.

184
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,680
There is a great clip that was sent into the show by Jacob.

185
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,540
We were recently talking on last and on Unplugged about the high amount of commercial development

186
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:04,580
that is now behind the Linux kernel, and that only 20% of Linux kernel development is done

187
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,120
by quote-unquote volunteers.

188
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,680
Well, Jacob linked us to a great talk held by Greg Kh.

189
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,160
Now, if you're not familiar with Greg Kh, not only does his last name initial sound

190
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,440
like Colonel Hacker, but he's a long-time Colonel Hacker, so it works out really well.

191
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,480
He was holding a talk recently, and he talked about this phenomenon where a lot of commercial

192
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,000
companies are behind Linux development, and I'll play it because Jacob linked us right

193
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
to it.

194
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,760
Who's doing the work?

195
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,360
Other people reported 80% of the work done on the Linux kernel is done by companies,

196
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,960
paid contributions.

197
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,120
Some people think it's a bad thing.

198
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,000
I think it's really good that 20% is done by people who aren't paid.

199
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is their hobby.

200
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,240
The problem with that 20% is if you start doing patches, you will get hired, and that

201
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,240
will be your job.

202
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Hey-oh.

203
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,200
This used to be my hobby.

204
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,480
Now I have no hobby.

205
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,800
Other kernel developers have known to burn out and start other hobbies, and then they

206
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,400
turn that into a company, and then they go back to kernel development.

207
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,520
It's happened a lot.

208
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
I think that's a great point.

209
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,800
That's essentially the point he makes there is if you are a hobbyist and you're doing

210
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,960
this and you're actually good at it and you're working at that level, at the Linux kernel

211
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,560
level with guys like Greg and Linus Torvalds, it's likely not going to be a hobby for very

212
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
long.

213
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,560
True.

214
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,760
That's a big part of why there is a small amount of hobby developers on there because,

215
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,560
like he said, it makes sense too.

216
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
You see it in a lot of things.

217
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,960
Whenever somebody starts as a hobby, I started podcasting as a hobby, and now I do it as

218
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,560
my day job.

219
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,840
It is true in a sense too that I don't really have much of a hobby anymore.

220
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,080
That happens to you though.

221
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,080
Yeah.

222
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,480
It's just the way of things.

223
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,800
But great point, and a big thank you to Jacob for not only finding that talk but for linking

224
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,040
us right to that time so we could share that with the rest of the audience.

225
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Okay.

226
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
So Roy writes in.

227
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,680
He says, I've got some ideas on why Linux is having troubles in the enterprise, which

228
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,240
I didn't really feel like this is a big problem, but he's talking about specifically on the

229
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
desktop.

230
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,400
He's not talking about on the server.

231
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,400
He says, hey Chris and Matt assembled a steam mumble room attendees and of course Chase.

232
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Oh yeah.

233
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Yeah.

234
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
I see that he said that.

235
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Yeah.

236
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,360
I wanted to comment about a topic you guys discussed in last week's Linux Unplugged about

237
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,040
what could possibly be the reason that the Linux desktop did not get into the enterprise

238
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,260
yet.

239
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,480
So the obvious reason is the business application support, but web-based applications tend to

240
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,200
allow enterprises to provide the business applications via all the browsers.

241
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,320
However, the most critical business applications that business enterprise use, Linux has failed

242
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,920
to deliver is a decent mail client, quote unquote, that works with exchange.

243
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,040
This is the first entry point to the enterprise.

244
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,760
We need a mail client that will be able to sync with exchange.

245
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,120
Let's take mobile mail apps.

246
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,220
The only reason mobile mail is getting into the enterprise is that the mail client is

247
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,680
able to sync up with exchange.

248
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,720
And I would agree that was a critical feature for Android and iOS.

249
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,800
He goes on to say for any other business application, even a native one, there's a decent solution

250
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,000
like Zen desktop, but if I can't get my own mail client to run natively on my Linux desktop,

251
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
what's the point of the Linux desktop at all?

252
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,280
Keep up the good work.

253
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
Roy.

254
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,160
Boy, well, you know, there's two things to consider here.

255
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,360
First of all, no one's, you know, the business you're working with using exchange, you can

256
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
use the web client.

257
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,360
Actually, if you use it within Firefox, it's actually, even under Linux, it's actually

258
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
quite usable.

259
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
And the later versions, too.

260
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
That's true.

261
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Yeah, that's true.

262
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
Yeah, exactly.

263
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
The later versions.

264
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,540
Now, older versions of exchange, it's not pretty, but it does work.

265
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:28,440
And that is to use evolution and the exchange connector, and really emphasizing it's not

266
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,260
pretty and really emphasizing older versions because it's definitely pretty hit and miss.

267
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,160
Not really a great solution, which brings me back to going back to the web client.

268
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,640
Honestly, you know, if you're going to be in an exchange area, I mean, I don't know.

269
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,360
I mean, I guess you could run Outlook in like a VM or something.

270
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
It's just, it's messy.

271
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Yeah, or crossover or something.

272
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Yeah.

273
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,960
Because I mean, I work for Microsoft shop and I use exchange all the time in a browser.

274
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
It's not really that bad.

275
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,520
Chase, have you, when you worked at Nielsen, did they use exchange there?

276
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,000
Were you an Outlook user?

277
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah, yeah.

278
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,920
It was heavily embedded and we also had to use them.

279
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,560
It was so embedded that we used it on our BlackBerrys and then onto the iPhone.

280
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,560
Yeah.

281
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,240
I mean, it's just like, it's so, so ugly.

282
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,720
And I wonder, is that going to be the case for, you look at like Google apps and Zimbra

283
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,000
Mail and a lot of these things.

284
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,240
To me, exchange seems to be the solution for a lot of people that want a local mail system.

285
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,360
But as a lot of people go with a hosted mail system, exchange just seems like one of the

286
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
many options.

287
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,040
But when you abstract away the actual hardware and you're not managing the software and you're

288
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,560
only interfacing it with some sort of remote sync protocol, it doesn't have to be exchange

289
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
anymore.

290
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,560
No, it doesn't.

291
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
No, there's many different options out there now.

292
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,320
So it might not be something that in the long run matters as much, but it definitely exists

293
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
today.

294
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,440
And I could see like, if you have to emulate one of the programs you use the most, it is

295
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,440
kind of silly to then use Linux if you're stuck with that.

296
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
So I see what Roy's saying.

297
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,440
I don't know.

298
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,400
I think what we can identify, especially through all the feedback that we've gotten is there's

299
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,200
a lot of little things, or in some cases they're not so little, but it's not one thing.

300
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,320
It's not Outlook.

301
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,600
It's not AutoCAD.

302
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,440
It's not any one particular thing that's holding it back.

303
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,880
Everybody has something that they've built around the Windows platform that they just

304
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,360
now have as an expectation of doing business.

305
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,080
But all of those things eventually in technology sunset.

306
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,640
And so Linux will be there.

307
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,640
That's true.

308
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,640
Although it's really tough to get through to a Microsoft shop, I found that it's very

309
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,480
challenging to try and actually get through that, because it's like, well, we could go

310
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,040
that way, but we know what to expect if we go ahead and suck it up and pay the licensing.

311
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
That's the problem.

312
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,240
Well, and we've got these guys here, and they know how to do it already.

313
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,920
If we ever want to fire them because we don't want to pay them enough, we can just hire

314
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,640
some other Microsoft guy to come in here and run this for us.

315
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,360
And it's cheaper to pay the licensing and the retraining, our existing folks.

316
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,000
I think that's a lot of it too.

317
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah.

318
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I think that's part of the momentum equation that Windows has on the desktop and server

319
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,160
and enterprise is that staff momentum.

320
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
You have staff training.

321
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,160
Yeah.

322
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
But you know what?

323
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,160
But to be fair here, here I am going to be doing a how-to Linux show.

324
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
I don't know.

325
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,760
Maybe I'm the one of the minority who has a freaking open mind about becoming retrained

326
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,800
and becoming cross-trained and learning more about more operating systems.

327
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,240
There are a lot of Windows guys out there who are just so focused in on Windows, it's

328
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,320
like, you know, F everything else on the Windows guy.

329
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,200
I'm like, whatever happened to being educated and learning about everything else?

330
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,040
And not to offend everybody in the audience, but I also see the same thing happen with

331
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,760
Cisco guys where they get Cisco trained and then they're so focused on Cisco they can't

332
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,480
see outside of the Cisco product space.

333
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,800
And so everything's a Cisco brand, everything's a Cisco solution, a Cisco implementation.

334
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:36,600
And there is something to becoming an expert at one thing and really deeply understanding

335
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,800
it.

336
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,520
But at the same time, I feel like it's a little better if you can zoom out a little bit and

337
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,000
generalize a little more and sort of see new trends and sort of take advantage of new technologies.

338
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,440
It should be, honestly, about using the best tool for the job.

339
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
Right.

340
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
There you go.

341
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,360
Regardless of operating system and software package.

342
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,640
I completely agree.

343
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,960
Speaking of the best tool for the job, this would be a great spot to mention our sponsor

344
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,000
this week, DigitalOcean.

345
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,200
Go over to DigitalOcean.com and take advantage of our promo code LINUXUNPLUGEDFEBRUARY.

346
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,720
It's only going to be working for a little bit longer.

347
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
February is almost over.

348
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Actually, it's over Friday.

349
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Yeah.

350
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
That's not true.

351
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
They'll keep it working for you.

352
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
DigitalOcean loves you guys.

353
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,560
But seriously, if you don't know about DigitalOcean, they're a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated

354
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,200
to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

355
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,040
Users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds, although our community has gotten that down

356
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,120
to 44 seconds.

357
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,600
And pricing plans start at only $5 a month for, get ready for this Chase, 512 megabytes

358
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
of RAM.

359
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
What?

360
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
A 20 gigabyte SSD.

361
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
No.

362
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
A CPU.

363
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
And this is the part I love.

364
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
This is the transfer.

365
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Jeez, man.

366
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
I know.

367
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
It's just a fixed cost.

368
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
You know exactly what you're going to get.

369
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
You know exactly what your bill's going to be.

370
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
The value is right there.

371
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
It's super simple.

372
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,280
And by the way, DigitalOcean also has hourly rates if you want to test an application.

373
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,240
I recently put up a Pastebin competitor on there.

374
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,080
I've got a BitTorrent sync for all our unfiltered supporter shows.

375
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,200
I got a calendar I'm throwing up on there.

376
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,600
And I've been getting emails from folks in the audience telling me what they're using

377
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
it for.

378
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,080
I'm getting all kinds of great ideas.

379
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,960
People are throwing up their XMPP server on there.

380
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,640
Another guy's got his personal resume up there.

381
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,560
It's kind of like an interactive website.

382
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,080
There's tons of great things you can do at DigitalOcean because they have this droplet

383
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,120
system where you can deploy a droplet of, like, you can take an Ubuntu 1204 machine

384
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,040
with Apache and MySQL ready to go or an Archbox or a Centbox or a Fedora box with Docker pre-installed

385
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,440
and you can load up your own Docker images that you've built locally on your own machine.

386
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,440
It's really great.

387
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,880
And if you use that promo code Linux Unplugged February, they'll give you a $10 credit so

388
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,400
you can try out that $5 rig for two months.

389
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,520
DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam, and Singapore.

390
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,080
Their interface is simple.

391
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,820
Their control panel is intuitive.

392
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,440
And power users can replicate that control panel with their straightforward API.

393
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,960
So go use the promo code Linux Unplugged February over at DigitalOcean.com.

394
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,400
See what I've been talking about.

395
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,720
It's so cool to see Linux technologies be utilized by a company like this.

396
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,440
They pair it with tier one bandwidth.

397
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,640
They put it on top of some SSDs and they really let KVM rip.

398
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,040
They got them super tuned in.

399
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
It's really great.

400
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,520
It's an awesome experience and a super great forward, super easy to manage.

401
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,920
DigitalOcean.com, Linux Unplugged February.

402
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Go try them out.

403
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,040
Get a $5 rig for two months.

404
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,720
It's a great training experience too because this imaging system lets you back it up and

405
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,080
if you screw something up, you can restore right back to it just like you could with

406
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,680
like VirtualBox or something.

407
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,120
Only this is a real machine up in the cloud that you can throw things at, test in production.

408
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
It's awesome.

409
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,880
DigitalOcean.com, Linux Unplugged February and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

410
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,320
Linux Unplugged.

411
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,400
So speaking of transitionary technologies, Dwayne wrote in with a response to something

412
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,400
our guest last week, Michael Hall said, where he wrote and he says, hi Chris, Matt and Chase.

413
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
I really enjoyed episode 20.

414
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
What's that say right there?

415
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Wait, it does say Chase.

416
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
It does say Chase.

417
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
It does say Chase.

418
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Yes.

419
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
It's there.

420
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,280
He says, he said he really enjoyed episode 28.

421
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,840
It was eye-opening.

422
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,200
Michael made a point about the major players not having identical versions of their operating

423
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:59,080
systems on both tablet, mobile or the desktop except for what Ubuntu is trying to do.

424
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,720
This is about to change quickly for Android.

425
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,360
I recently downloaded Android x86 and it runs well on my laptop, which is a Dell Inspiron

426
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:13,160
M5010 with an AMD 2 gigahertz triple core processor, 4 gigabytes of RAM and a 500 gigabyte

427
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,440
hard drive and an AMD 4200 graphics.

428
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,800
He says, with more work, I can see it as a real quick OS to go to for anybody with an

429
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,660
Intel or AMD class processor with an NVIDIA ATI or Intel graphics.

430
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,760
As long as you have a Gmail account, you're good to go.

431
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,320
And it's at, we've talked about it before on last, but you can find it at android-x86.org.

432
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:36,120
Matt or Chase, have either one of you played with the Android x86 project where you can

433
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
actually download like an ISO?

434
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
No, I have not.

435
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
No.

436
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,120
Very interesting.

437
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,000
I've downloaded it, but I never actually installed it because I was toying with the idea, but

438
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,840
I found that there's certain limitations to it as far as what you can do with it.

439
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,840
Yeah.

440
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
It's something I want to dive into.

441
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,840
Yeah.

442
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,040
I've played with it a little bit and you know, Android is just really not meant for a desktop.

443
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
I could see it maybe with like a skin.

444
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
Well, it was tried before.

445
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,040
It wasn't, didn't like Motorola have their, what was it, Atrix, right?

446
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
Yep, yep.

447
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,760
Where you could dock it and it becomes a computer and a phone all in one.

448
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,040
They heavily modified the UI in that use case.

449
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,160
Yes, they did.

450
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,620
And so, you know, and this is the sort of the secret sauce to the Ubuntu Touch approach

451
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,600
is this UI transmogrification when you switch into the different use cases.

452
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Look it up, kids.

453
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,680
You got the transmogrifier that sits in there, it's a kernel extension.

454
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,640
You got to compile it or use DKMS if you just want to, you know, just be able to update

455
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,640
your kernel on the go.

456
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,180
It'll just rebuild your module for you automatically.

457
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,880
And then when you plug it into your TV or your laptop or your whatever it is, it just

458
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
transmogrifies.

459
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
Right?

460
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
Do I have that right?

461
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
Transmogrify.

462
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Yeah.

463
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
I got that right.

464
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
Yeah.

465
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
And I think that's a little bit better of a solution, but we'll see how far they can

466
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,880
close that gap.

467
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,960
If they could, what the question will be is our desktop, this is my main concern and we'll

468
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,560
see, our desktop applications in that perfect world going to live in this uncanny valley.

469
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,640
Where they're not quite a desktop app, but they're not quite a mobile app and they're

470
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,280
just not quite there yet and it's kind of hard to really put your finger on what's not

471
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,080
quite there about it yet, but you can just kind of feel it.

472
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,200
We'll see if that ends up happening.

473
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,600
If they can avoid that scenario, I'm looking forward to it.

474
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,440
But Android X86, I think for that to take off, Google's not going to make it happen.

475
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,280
It's going to take a company that could really own that and unfortunately have to put some

476
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,920
kind of UI on top of it.

477
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,760
And then would you even get Google to stamp it with their Google mobile services?

478
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
Never going to happen.

479
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
Yeah.

480
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
I wouldn't think so.

481
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
No.

482
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,600
Not unless they got some really big player who is really like buddy-buddy with Google.

483
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Yeah.

484
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
All right.

485
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,920
Well, why don't we do a little valve update?

486
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,540
Oh, yes.

487
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,760
First thing is not that the Unfilter Show.

488
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,560
Chase, look what you're making me say now.

489
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,160
See, this is what happens when you only have me here for Unfilter.

490
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Oh, now look, I'm getting crap.

491
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
I'm getting crap.

492
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
No.

493
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,800
I was going to say we don't try to break news on Unplugged, but we are going to break a

494
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,960
little news today because Portal 2 has just come out.

495
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,040
Portal 2 beta for Linux was released today.

496
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,300
You can go check it out.

497
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:01,800
And on that whole valve vein, Anno wrote in, he said, I'd like to comment on the VAC topic

498
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
from last week's show.

499
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,600
Now, we covered this last week, this little DNS hashing, scanning that Valve was doing,

500
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,880
trying to catch people cheating Valve games.

501
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,480
He says, I manage a medium-sized game server and we have been fighting hackers and cheaters

502
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,760
for years with a VAC-like system.

503
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,520
These cheats usually work at a low level by injecting their code into the game memory

504
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,200
so you either have to combat them at this level or detect them higher up and target

505
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,840
their specific behavior.

506
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,360
In this case, it was DNS entries.

507
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:34,480
The inherent problem of all the anti-cheat systems is you can't open source them or disclose

508
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,760
too much information about them and what they actually do because hackers would use this

509
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,360
information to implement a workaround.

510
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,440
If Valve said they'd check your DNS cache loud and clear, hackers would only need a

511
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,040
few days to change their cheats and not two weeks.

512
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,960
Instead, you'd probably agreed to this in the fine print you signed up when you agreed

513
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,160
to the Steam Terms of Service.

514
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,960
At the end of the day, you have to ask yourself whether you'd rather play games with cheaters

515
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,400
or allow Valve to scan your computer in questionable ways.

516
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,080
Personally, I'm completely fine with this because playing against cheaters frustrates

517
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,080
me to no end.

518
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Best regards, Anno.

519
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,960
Yeah, I don't quite know where to fall down.

520
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,720
I'm not comfortable with Valve scanning my DNS cache.

521
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
I'm not either.

522
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,680
I mean, but at the same time, if you're doing anything kind of weird, you should probably

523
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,680
use a different computer.

524
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
Just put that out there.

525
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,440
Yeah, I mean, I'm not worried about so much that.

526
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,920
I just don't like the principle of it.

527
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,520
It feels like an invasion of privacy.

528
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,400
But what is the solution here, though?

529
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
I mean, what is it?

530
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
A dedicated computer for Valve.

531
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
I mean, really.

532
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
I mean, I think that's...

533
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Sandboxing?

534
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,080
Yeah, sandboxing would be okay.

535
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,080
I don't know.

536
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Maybe.

537
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,280
I mean, it feels like this is actually a limitation in the underlying operating systems privilege

538
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,400
model and not maybe necessarily...

539
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,880
And the only solution for companies like Valve is to come up with their own ways to sort

540
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,480
of circumvent those limitations.

541
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,080
I don't know.

542
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,920
I understand this is what they have to do.

543
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,400
And maybe this is just the trade-off gamers have to make is, okay, my games are going

544
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,680
to be wrapped up in DRM.

545
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,680
Okay, I can't.

546
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,760
I don't quite own them.

547
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,160
They're actually stored in some sort of cloud storage that lets me install them when I want

548
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,240
to, assuming my account hasn't been closed.

549
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,920
Okay, I'll buy off on those things.

550
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,600
I can accept those limitations.

551
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,200
And now you're asking me to also accept the idea that, well, this last week it was DNS

552
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,880
cache scanning, but how long until it's all the processes running on my box?

553
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,480
Or, well, now we need to watch your network packets because now they're being really tricky.

554
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,400
And yeah, where did we draw the line?

555
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,260
Because it seems like reading DNS cache, I realized they were just hashing it and then

556
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,800
sending a hash to Valve.

557
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,040
I get that.

558
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,600
But where do we start saying, okay, that's too far?

559
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,800
If we're okay with the DNS hashing, what are we not okay with?

560
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Screen grabs?

561
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,120
Just straight up screen grabs on my machine?

562
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,160
Do you need to monitor my machine when I'm not playing games so that way you can catch

563
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,240
me installing the cheat before I ever run the game?

564
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
Is that what we're going to come to?

565
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,360
Well, you know, like Punk Buster, a great example is that actually takes screenshots

566
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
of gameplay.

567
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
Yeah.

568
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,040
Yeah, so that kind of situation has already been happening to gamers for a long period

569
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
of time.

570
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,000
Well, okay, so at what point do they need to analyze every setup.exe that runs on a

571
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Windows box?

572
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,280
Well, they do that.

573
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,800
They actually, Punk Buster actually does monitor what you're running in the background.

574
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
How?

575
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Ah, it's so creepy.

576
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,840
Yeah, I think it's been doing that for a long time, hasn't it?

577
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,840
It's been doing it a long time.

578
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,840
You know what I say to that?

579
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
It's a comeback.

580
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,840
Go ahead.

581
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
Get it out of here.

582
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,840
That's what I say to that.

583
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Yeah.

584
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
That is, that is no good.

585
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,140
You know, and see, it's for myself, it's the same way.

586
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,040
It's like, okay, TSA kind of thing.

587
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
I don't like TSA.

588
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
I don't fly.

589
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
I mean, there's nothing I can do about it at this point.

590
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
I think it's the same thing here.

591
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,040
I can either not use the game or, you know, or I can set up a dedicated box.

592
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
Do what I do, Matt.

593
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,360
I just get the $50 fast pass and TSA does not refuse.

594
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,040
Does Valve offer a $50 fast pass?

595
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
No, unfortunately, they don't.

596
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
Right.

597
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,040
Yeah, there you go.

598
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Enhanced driver's license.

599
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,120
I just wish they could be, I realize they can't because of the nature of what they're

600
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
trying to combat.

601
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,360
I just wish they could be more transparent about what they're doing.

602
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,560
But yeah, the transparency is the key that, you know, people need to know exactly what

603
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,560
they're doing.

604
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,960
But then again, it goes back to the whole thing.

605
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,040
If you give out too much information, then the hackers know what to do.

606
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
Right.

607
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,280
And it is kind of a marketing buzzkill.

608
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,040
Say, hey, this is great, by the way, we're totally scanning your stuff.

609
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,160
Yeah, that's not a great bullet point, is it?

610
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
No.

611
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
No, it really isn't.

612
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,560
I mean, from a marketer's point of view, that would just suck.

613
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,480
You know, the other thing, like Danny Tech is saying, is this is why things like the

614
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,480
Humble Bundle and this is why it's really important that Valve doesn't own this entire

615
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,720
thing because even though we like them today, when they have SteamOS, they can go even further

616
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,200
than they have in the past.

617
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
And you know, it's good to have alternative options.

618
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Yeah.

619
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Yeah, this is true.

620
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
This is true.

621
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
All right.

622
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Well, that concludes our Valve update.

623
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Yes.

624
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
I just wanted to know.

625
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
I got to go.

626
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
I got to go play some Half-Life real quick.

627
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Yeah.

628
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
I'll be back later.

629
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Yeah, it does kind of make me want to play a game when I hear it.

630
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
All right.

631
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,520
Well, before we get to the how-to Linux discussion, why don't we play my interview with Brendan,

632
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,720
who is working on ClementineOS, which is kind of on pause right now.

633
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,800
So we'll play that and then we'll come back.

634
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,120
So I'll have links to this too in the show notes if you guys didn't catch all of the

635
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
drama that went on.

636
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,000
But if you guys remember, this happened about 30 days ago.

637
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,440
The developer of PairOS posted on Google Plus that the Mac-like distribution had been sold

638
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,340
to another company and as part of that sale could no longer be downloaded.

639
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,160
So then from that, the ClementineOS project was started.

640
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,080
Brendan was an enthusiast and an advocate for the distribution.

641
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,220
He wanted to sort of continue it in his own way with some modifications to make it better.

642
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:30,840
And he received a letter from an American company that forced him to abandon the project.

643
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,560
He did later say it wasn't Apple, but there were still some people that thought it might

644
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
have been.

645
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,680
So he joined me yesterday to get the details on that.

646
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,520
I wanted to get you on because, you know, a little while back there was a few stories

647
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,760
going around on the net that I didn't really feel like we got a good picture on what was

648
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,700
actually going on.

649
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,240
And I thought maybe we could start there and then kind of work our way out.

650
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,560
So were you one of the guys that worked on PairOS or worked with the PairOS project?

651
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:00,400
No, I just was using it like the OS and got discontinued.

652
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,200
So I wanted to continue the project.

653
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,400
So what you were creating was sort of, you took the, you essentially cloned a lot of

654
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,200
that project and started your own OS based on that?

655
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,200
Yes.

656
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Okay.

657
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,040
And that was called or is called ClementineOS, right?

658
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Yeah.

659
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,300
I mean, it was Clementine and then we had trouble.

660
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:24,520
So then, well, now when I say Clementine, I replaced the C with the K now for ClementineOS.

661
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,520
ClementineMusicPlayer.

662
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,000
So this is still around and it's still alive?

663
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:37,480
It's right now, it's just a private thing for just me because the site, I had some apparently

664
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:43,040
copyrighted files and stuff of PairOS and got into some legal issues.

665
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,960
So can you tell me a little, what happened with those legal issues?

666
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
Was it?

667
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Okay.

668
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,120
Well, we had, if you went to our download page in PairOS, we had the same exact download

669
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,240
CD cover and everything, we just replaced it with our images and everything.

670
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
That was fine.

671
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,360
But then when we went and we're trying to replace the other images, when we saw pictures

672
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,880
of like the laptops running the OS, we tried cropping out the screenshot built in and cropping

673
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,680
one of ours over it and it didn't really work.

674
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,160
So we just posted it with their screenshot and it had the Pair logo and kind of gotten

675
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,760
the legal issues there.

676
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,880
To clarify though, were legal issues brought to you from the PairOS project or by the company

677
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,200
that bought PairOS?

678
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
The company that bought it.

679
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,200
But you can't say who they are, right?

680
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
No, I can't.

681
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,680
Is it a company I'm familiar with?

682
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,240
Yeah.

683
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,880
If you're in the Linux world, yes.

684
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,880
Yeah.

685
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,880
Okay.

686
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
Interesting.

687
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,280
And I don't think it's been made public who bought PairOS, but so that company contacted

688
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,920
you and said, you need to stop using our branding.

689
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Yeah.

690
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:49,320
They got an email and it was from a lawyer, all legal issues and terms.

691
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,000
So I just immediately took it down.

692
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,240
I didn't want to get in any trouble.

693
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
I see.

694
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,280
So they're not necessarily taking up issue with Clementine OS, they're more taking up

695
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,680
issue with uses of their assets.

696
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,200
So does that mean the project might not be dead?

697
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,200
It's actually trying, working on trying to get more, some coders into it.

698
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,000
So yeah, I'm trying to bring it back.

699
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Okay.

700
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
All right.

701
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's about 100% dead.

702
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,440
So I think a lot of people might remember PairOS, it looks a lot like, I guess, OS X.

703
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,440
Yeah.

704
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,840
Is Clementine OS or Clementine going to, with a K, going to be essentially continuing that

705
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
transit, tradition?

706
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,040
Yes, but we're probably going to go with a different look than what Pair did.

707
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Yeah.

708
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
Give me a hint.

709
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:42,800
Well, it's going to use the latest GNOME and 14.04 based, but it's going to have the same

710
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:48,040
window style and everything, but it's going to have kind of like an elementary OS bar

711
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:54,760
clear, but it's going to have the, our Clementine logo and stuff where the pair used to be.

712
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,440
So what is it that like current distros on the market today lack that you feel like,

713
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,760
you know, so when I think of something like this, I think of, for example, elementary

714
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,560
OS, what would you say those types of distributions lack that inspire you to go out and create

715
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,120
your own distribution?

716
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,880
Well, what I think it lacks is, when I try installing elementary OS, everyone said it's

717
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
stable.

718
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,840
When I try installing on any of my systems, I always have issues.

719
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,200
It just, it does not work.

720
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,760
I have tons of issues with it.

721
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
So is that all?

722
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,720
I got an itch and I need to scratch a problem.

723
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Yeah.

724
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,340
So it takes a bunch of configuration to get it working.

725
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:34,720
And a lot of people I think it's from, and my grandpa on my dad's side, he's into Linux

726
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,280
and he thinks it's because it uses an older kernel.

727
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,280
Yeah.

728
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,360
So that's where a lot of people thinks it's at.

729
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,360
Yeah.

730
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,480
So I want to try to have the latest kernel on this.

731
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
Always have the latest.

732
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,920
Do you still have, would it be built on top of Ubuntu?

733
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,480
Yes, but I will update the kernels myself.

734
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Yeah.

735
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
Yeah.

736
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
Well, that sounds pretty interesting.

737
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,480
And it's been a story that hasn't quite exactly faded away.

738
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,160
So it's good to get a little idea of what happened around the whole pair OS situation.

739
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:08,120
And the one thing I think all those distrusts lack is where pair OS filled it in was like,

740
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,640
all of it's easy to use programs.

741
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,120
Like a lot of people have issues with PPAs, adding those in terminal.

742
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,320
The interest of the program called PPA manager and added or removed and installed programs

743
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
with ease and-

744
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,880
And all that's GPL code, right?

745
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
Yeah.

746
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
That's all GPL.

747
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,760
So yeah, we are going to recreate those programs.

748
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
Yeah.

749
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,760
Good.

750
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
Our own image.

751
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
That was an interesting idea.

752
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,360
That's a great example of something that the pair OS brought to the table, aside from the

753
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,880
aesthetics that look a lot like the Mac is that it was solving some of these gaps and

754
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,400
other distributions have attempted, like Mint has attempted to solve these problems too.

755
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,880
But so it sounds like, one of the things I really wanted to get the bottom of in this

756
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,480
conversation, it doesn't sound like they were necessarily going after you for having a clone

757
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,720
of the distribution, but just for art assets that are being used.

758
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,560
So it sounds like if you guys get everything in place, you're in the clear to continue

759
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
development.

760
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
Yes.

761
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
And that's why we changed the name.

762
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,520
We just put a K in front of it because we also got legal notice from the Clementine

763
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,280
project for the music players.

764
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,720
So we kind of changed the name real quick and they're okay with it.

765
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,880
We emailed them with the name change and they said, you can keep the Clementine name.

766
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
Yeah, just replace it with a K. We're okay with that.

767
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
So that worked out.

768
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,880
Oh, good.

769
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,360
Is there a fair warning to anybody thinking about launching into this kind of stuff?

770
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,200
You got to go, you have to think about everything before you name it and all this.

771
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,200
You have to Google if there's any names out there that you're eating.

772
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Exactly.

773
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Yeah, you really do.

774
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
You got to be careful.

775
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
Well, good.

776
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,720
I just wanted to kind of get the story straight.

777
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,320
Is there anything else you want to touch on before I run?

778
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:38,440
No, I don't think that's the one thing is I want to say is everyone keeps saying Apple

779
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,360
bought it and they did not buy it.

780
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,560
Just to say that, not Apple bought it.

781
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,320
Now did you feed that a little bit by making a joke online?

782
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,960
Did you crack some jokes that people kind of took too seriously?

783
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,280
People on the Paralyze community were, oh, Apple bought it and then posting things to

784
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,240
articles like Apple bought Paralyze and I'm sitting there like, it has nothing to do with

785
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,240
Apple.

786
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,240
They're not big enough.

787
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,720
They would have to be bigger than Ubuntu.

788
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
They're not.

789
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,720
Yeah.

790
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,440
Well, I thought that might be the case, but that was pretty funny the way that kind of

791
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,520
lit up online.

792
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,440
So it's good to get that clarification too.

793
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,440
Just rumors.

794
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,440
Yeah.

795
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
Very good, sir.

796
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,840
Well, thanks for coming on and clearing things up for us.

797
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
All right.

798
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,540
So I wanted to, I thought the sort of the takeaway I had from that chat was, holy crap,

799
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:25,000
it's harder to make a distro these days than, you know, than it used to be.

800
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,760
And you see, he stepped into an art landmine and then he got contacted by another project

801
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,400
in their name and none of it's all that surprising in retrospect, but it's something you definitely

802
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,600
got to think about.

803
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,800
And I think a lot of people, they sit down to make a Linux distro, they don't really,

804
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
they don't consider this kind of stuff.

805
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
I don't know.

806
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,600
I think the main thing to really consider here too is that it's a little bit like ripping

807
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,600
DVDs.

808
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,040
If you're doing it in the quiet, quiet realm of your own home or your own home office or

809
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,480
even your own office, you probably are fine.

810
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,120
But as soon as you put that out on the internet for the masses, trademarks, copyrights, various

811
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,200
registered stuff, you really do have to do your homework and Google is not going to cut

812
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
it.

813
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,800
You actually need to really do a proper search.

814
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,800
So yeah.

815
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Yeah.

816
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Yeah.

817
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Good point.

818
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
All right.

819
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,560
Well, before we get to the discussion about how to Linux, I want to thank Ting.com for

820
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,140
sponsoring this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

821
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,440
What is Ting.com?

822
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,080
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

823
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,280
My mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider.

824
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
Oh yes.

825
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,280
Rockin' Ting for a while now.

826
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,280
Here's how you get started.

827
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,280
Go to Linux.ting.com.

828
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,360
It could be like Mr. Chase who was just over here experimenting with the Ting Sim just

829
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,360
a few minutes ago.

830
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,360
Yes.

831
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,120
Pulling the Ting Sim out of my Nexus 5 and putting it into his HTC One.

832
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,700
So Linux.ting.com will take $25 off your first device or $25 off your first month if you

833
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,240
bring your own device.

834
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,460
But let me tell you a little bit about what makes Ting so awesome.

835
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,660
You know they have no contract.

836
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,320
You know they have no early termination fee.

837
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,320
What?

838
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,320
It's true, Chase.

839
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,320
It's true.

840
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,320
And you only pay for what you use.

841
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,440
Six dollars, a flat rate, plus taxes.

842
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,400
But what's so awesome is that Ting dashboard gives you your usage, you can manage multiple

843
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,120
devices under a single account, you can get a snapshot of where each device is at.

844
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,600
Even if you have a whole bunch of devices for like a company, they really make the billing

845
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,800
super straightforward and easy to understand for one phone or for multiple phones.

846
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,560
I have two phones on my Ting line.

847
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
It's so easy.

848
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
So straightforward.

849
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,160
So you only pay for what you use.

850
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,800
Only pay six dollars flat rate and it's just my usage on top of that.

851
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,080
Every plan includes tethering and hotspot.

852
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,200
I can set up device nicknames in the dashboard.

853
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,800
I can set up voicemail, caller ID, hiding the caller ID when I call somebody, where

854
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,680
it forwards to when a phone number is busy.

855
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,320
All through their very simple dashboard including setting up like alerts.

856
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,080
Like you know when I give my son Dylan a phone, I want to know, hey if Dylan uses more than

857
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,520
a gigabyte in a billing period, send a push notification to my Ting app.

858
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
Yeah, what's he doing on that phone?

859
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
What's he doing exactly?

860
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,520
Yeah.

861
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
What's he doing?

862
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,480
And this is a great example of why it's so nice to have the Ting dashboard paired with

863
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,280
the awesome Ting customer service.

864
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:58,720
You can call Ting at 1-855-846-4389 between 8am and 8pm eastern time and a real human.

865
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,600
Not a robot, not a called tree, answers the phone.

866
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,800
And here's a novel idea, that human that answers the phone, he's actually empowered to solve

867
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,800
your problem.

868
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,800
I know, it's crazy.

869
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,800
Nice.

870
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,040
And as a long time Ting customer now for over a year, what I really appreciate is the Ting

871
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,240
blog over at Ting.com slash blog where they have videos posted frequently with Ting staff

872
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,920
members today.

873
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,240
They put up an interview with one of their executives, Brad, what he thinks about making

874
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,760
prepaid Ting accounts where you pre-fill a Ting account and then you just kind of run

875
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760
through that.

876
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,600
And he talks, he ends a little bit about some cool stuff Ting has coming up too.

877
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,480
And I love staying informed in the loop about the companies that I'm voting with with my

878
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,480
dollar.

879
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,360
I like to know what they're actually up to and this is a great example of how Ting keeps

880
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,920
really keeps you informed on what they have coming up.

881
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,720
You're not sort of left up to a mystery.

882
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,540
I actually feel like I kind of understand like their rationale, what their focus is,

883
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:58,280
what their reasoning is and that is empowering to me as the person making the decision to

884
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,840
spend my money there every single month.

885
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,800
That's empowering to me and I appreciate that.

886
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,240
You can go over to linux.ting.com to get started.

887
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,600
That lets them know you heard about it right here on the Linux Unplugged show.

888
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,640
You appreciate them supporting Linux Unplugged.

889
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,880
It also gets you that $25 discount and while you're over there, click that how much would

890
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
you save button.

891
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,160
It's going to take you to a magical billing calculator and they will estimate what your

892
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,160
bill would be on Ting and let me tell you with those new reduced data rates, it's a

893
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,640
better deal than ever.

894
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,720
No contracts, no early terminations, early termination relief program and much more.

895
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:35,800
Get started by going to linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux

896
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Unplugged.

897
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,040
You know, once I'm out of my contract, because right now I'm stuck in a contract.

898
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,040
Once I'm out, I'm jumping.

899
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,040
You should.

900
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,200
I mean, I want to make it happen.

901
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,720
If you get the itch beforehand, they have that early termination relief, look $75 per

902
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,440
line and they'll apply it right to you.

903
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,960
That'll pay for Ting for like months.

904
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,840
Once I get to that threshold where I don't have to, you know, I think it's like six or

905
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,640
twelve months out, because you know they knock ten bucks off every month.

906
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,680
They try to get you to stick with them for a little while.

907
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,680
And Ting just is like, you know, we're not doing any of that.

908
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,680
We're going to get rid of that.

909
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,680
That's awesome.

910
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:10,200
All right, so let's bring in our virtual lug here and let's start a little around the horn

911
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,400
about the how-to Linux show we have coming.

912
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,240
We announced it in the last 300 and we've got some work, we're working on like several

913
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,800
things at once with the show.

914
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,880
Yes, a lot of work.

915
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,000
I mean more work that is being done in the pre-planning of this show than probably any

916
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,600
other show that I've ever done, ever.

917
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,280
Every new show I launch, it's more and more every time.

918
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,480
And what's crazy about this, so this is kind of serving as like we're just going to put

919
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,400
essentially a lot of our ideas and concepts behind making the show on the record that

920
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,640
way down the road when the show has been out there for a while, people can go back to this

921
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,760
and sort of get an understanding of its roots.

922
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,440
And the reason I want to do this is I would be really thrilled if eventually how-to Linux

923
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,640
could be looked upon as another source of living Linux documentation in a sense.

924
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:05,240
So we have a lot of options and outlets out there, you know, how-to forge, there's stack

925
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,920
exchange websites, there's the Linux documentation project, there's Linux questions, there's

926
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,440
all these sites and they're all really good and they all serve a purpose.

927
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,720
I would like to not replace any of those but add to those another medium, another way for

928
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,880
people who are sitting down at the computer and they want to solve something, I want everybody

929
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,160
who has no idea what Linux is to everybody who knows what Linux is and knows they can

930
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,360
accomplish that task and they just want to get it done.

931
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:38,880
So to really understand how to solve that particular problem, what I realized is discoverability

932
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,780
is going to be a huge, huge, huge aspect of the show because it's got to be people are

933
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,680
like sitting down at YouTube and they're looking for a guide on how to do something, they're

934
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,120
sitting down at Google and I think part of that, I think a key part of that is going

935
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,740
to be keeping it to a short length.

936
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:57,560
Like I'm talking 15 minutes, no more than 30 minutes per episode.

937
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,000
We're going to get to the point, we're going to show you how.

938
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,680
Yeah, because you want somebody who's like browsing a list of results, if they see an

939
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,640
hour long show, they're going to look at that and go, oh, I can't, I got to get this problem

940
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,640
solved.

941
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,160
I can't burn an hour watching these guys jerk off in front of the camera.

942
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,040
I want my problem solved, right?

943
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:18,840
And I think, you know, just mentally that's a blocker where if you see 15 minutes on that

944
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,840
video and this is a problem you want to solve, that's 15 minutes of time well spent.

945
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,360
It's a totally different value equation in my opinion.

946
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,440
Yep, and every question that we bring to the table for the show, we're going to give it

947
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,840
the same care and same quality as the next question, meaning we're not going to short

948
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,960
change a question just because it could be a little bit more difficult or a little bit

949
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,960
easier.

950
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,960
We're going to give it the same care.

951
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,540
And that's, that's the kind of envision that I have in my head for this show where it's

952
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,320
going to be solid.

953
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,760
It's going to be good where you're not going to have to think about the production.

954
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,440
If it's in the title, that's what you're getting, right?

955
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,440
That's what you're going to get.

956
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,680
You're not going to have to search maybe halfway through the video to find the real topic.

957
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,720
It's going to be boom right in your face.

958
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:05,360
Yeah, and the other thing I think combined with that though is I like the idea of, I

959
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,520
don't know if these two things are conflicts, so I'd love to hear what the Mumble Room thinks

960
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
about this.

961
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,040
I also like the idea of a multi-part series.

962
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,100
So part one, you take a topic and then you break it down into chunks and you say, here's

963
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:24,480
the introduction, here's starting at, at ground zero, like, you know, set up, pour your foundation.

964
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,300
Here's the next part where you're now building on top of that foundation.

965
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,280
Now here in part three, we're actually putting it in production.

966
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,640
And then in part four, here's how you secure it, lock it down.

967
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,300
And if you have an internet facing, you're not going to, you know, expose your home network

968
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,300
to attack.

969
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,760
And this way you don't have to worry about, all right, all right.

970
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,000
You could watch one piece if you're only interested in that one piece.

971
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,600
Well, and you don't have to worry about, all right, well, I'm, I'm about what, 15 minutes

972
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
in.

973
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,120
I know where I was.

974
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,080
And then when I come back and watch it, you don't have to worry about that.

975
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,620
Or if you decide, okay, I'm going to watch the building part and then in a month I'll

976
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,160
come back and watch the securing part.

977
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,120
And so I don't know though, and I'd like to hear the mumble room here.

978
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:04,720
I don't know if, if these two things are a conflict, is a super short show, but then

979
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,160
also broken out into multi-parts.

980
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,560
Do those things go together?

981
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:16,720
Conflict if you do it in a situation where the multi-part series is not on like the continuous

982
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,720
basis.

983
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,280
So like say you have a, let's say the show's weekly.

984
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,520
One week comes out with an episode that starts a series.

985
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,040
The next week is not the continuation of that series.

986
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,160
Instead, there's a separate section on the website where you get the, each video separated.

987
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,800
So it's not like someone goes in and says, Hey, I want to watch this.

988
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,860
But then they see that that's not something I want to watch.

989
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:42,220
They're not going to just skip a whole month of videos that apply to that series.

990
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,260
I'm trying to track back.

991
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:48,160
So what you're saying is, so a one week comes out, that episode is the introduction video

992
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,240
and all the other videos associated with it are released at the same time?

993
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,300
No, they don't necessarily have to be the rest of the time, but they should be all like

994
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,600
on the same, the same page or the same section.

995
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,000
So the next week it's not, it's a different topic.

996
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
So if someone's not interested in that topic, they won't just skip the continuous weeks

997
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
until the series over.

998
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Okay.

999
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,720
So how do you think YouTube playlists could play into this?

1000
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,040
Well, I think like if you have a multi-part series, then you could go ahead and throw

1001
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,040
those into a playlist and have that playlist a part of the account.

1002
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,040
You know what I'm saying?

1003
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,640
Where people can go, if they want to watch the whole thing, they can, if they just want

1004
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,040
to watch a certain part of it, like the 15 minute segments you're talking about, then

1005
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,080
yes, they could, they have that option.

1006
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,840
They could do it both ways.

1007
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,680
And Faye, you wanted to kind of mention it from a new user perspective.

1008
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:37,280
Well, when I was a new user, I didn't even know about the resources that exist in order

1009
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,280
to find how to solve my problems.

1010
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,280
And you kind of get directed towards the forums and you may or may not get responses.

1011
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,640
And then you have to read documentation that contains a whole lot of jargon you're not

1012
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,640
familiar with.

1013
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,040
But just having a video in the first place is, was, when I started using links a few

1014
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,320
years ago, that was the best option for me.

1015
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,440
But most of these videos, they weren't very professional and they were scattered.

1016
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,320
It's not like they did them for, as a job.

1017
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,820
They just did them when they wanted to show somebody how to do something.

1018
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:06,800
So even if, I mean, having a concise video is a wise choice, but even if they were a

1019
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,240
little bit longer, I think a lot of people would get benefit from it just because it

1020
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,280
shows them how to do something the right way the first time.

1021
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,280
Yeah.

1022
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,280
The thing is, I think part of the reason why we've been looking at the particular timeframe

1023
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:25,920
of 50 to 30 minutes is we're very conscious of the audience and how people have busy lives

1024
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,480
and they don't want to have to sit in front of their computer for an hour to watch a video

1025
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,000
or a how-to video.

1026
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,640
You want to get to the point.

1027
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:39,400
And also, attention spans sometimes can drift off after 30 minutes or so.

1028
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:45,640
So we want to quick hit you and we're trying to figure out how do you do a large project

1029
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,640
and spread that out.

1030
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,400
I mean, obviously, we're going to be shooting these.

1031
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,400
Yeah.

1032
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:55,180
We don't want to have to skimp and gloss over certain details because if we're only going

1033
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,360
to give an entire topic 30 minutes, we could probably fit that into an episode of last.

1034
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:04,160
But we want to be able to feature something that, just as a total random example, but

1035
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,840
let's say it was setting up a lamp stack, which I don't think would be top on our list,

1036
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,400
but let's just say that's one of them.

1037
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,720
Wouldn't it be great to actually start at the very beginning?

1038
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,840
Get that system loaded up.

1039
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,000
Get those packages installed.

1040
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Get those dependencies.

1041
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Get all that figured out.

1042
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Get your web server set up.

1043
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Get your modules figured out.

1044
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,400
And that's separate episodes.

1045
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,240
And then at the end of it, you secure that thing down.

1046
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:30,600
And then maybe, okay, this is more work, but the other thought that crossed our mind was

1047
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,320
when it airs, because really what we're trying to build up is a back catalog.

1048
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,480
So we're looking at this from the perspective of people are coming across this for years

1049
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,160
down the road, not just that week.

1050
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,800
But so it would air in a weekly basis and at the end of that set, so maybe it's a three

1051
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:51,420
episode set or a four episode set of how to do something, then one single video in a master

1052
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:57,360
RSS feed of completed episodes where everything is just in one long connected video could

1053
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,400
be published separately.

1054
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,440
So people would have an option to watch the individual stages as they come out, or they

1055
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,120
could wait till the end of the whole run and watch one contiguous video.

1056
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,600
You could say episodes five through nine is about doing X, things like that.

1057
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,060
And at the end of that run, they're all available as one single download or individually.

1058
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,120
But if there's someone who doesn't have an interest in that particular topic, that means

1059
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,560
four episodes that they're not going to watch.

1060
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,560
Right.

1061
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,560
Well, and that's the thing, though.

1062
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,840
I mean, we're going to be doing a how to Linux show, and that's one of those things where

1063
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,600
we're going to run into, I think, regardless of what it is.

1064
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
Right.

1065
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,800
But instead of having the four episodes where people are that one topic that people are

1066
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,680
not going to watch, you could have different episodes that they would have different topics

1067
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,320
that would get more people watching it.

1068
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,320
But how do you do that?

1069
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,320
That's the nature of the show.

1070
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,680
I mean, you just have to do stuff and people aren't going to be interested in a lot of

1071
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,680
it.

1072
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,680
That's true.

1073
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,860
But if you do a series in the sense of episode five, part one, part two, and part three,

1074
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:59,280
you still get the series separation, the part separation, but you don't have to have a train

1075
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,320
of a month of people not being interested in the show, and they might forget it at that

1076
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,320
point.

1077
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,960
But at that point, why even slice it up?

1078
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:12,600
I mean, if you're going to do it in that route, say 5A, 5B, and 5C, there's really no point

1079
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,600
in slicing it up.

1080
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,760
It just causes more work to be done in the production side and more work to be done in

1081
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,560
the actual shooting side.

1082
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,560
Right.

1083
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,560
So two things.

1084
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:28,440
I think the number one thing, which is just based on just experience, is if we were developing

1085
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,760
an application and you could list out all of the features of that application, the number

1086
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:38,640
one feature has to be short length, I think, just because you're not getting a lot of people

1087
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,720
in the door unless it's short.

1088
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,840
So I think that's the number one hard point we're up against.

1089
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,840
And that's just based on discoverability data that I've just watched over the years.

1090
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:53,560
And the second thing to that end is I kind of feel like there is definitely that scenario

1091
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:58,480
where people are not going to be interested in the how to run for that period.

1092
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,560
But at the same time, I don't really see a great solution to that problem.

1093
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,200
It kind of seems like this is just going to be the nature of this kind of show.

1094
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,960
Because if you break it out like we're talking about, you're not going to get around that.

1095
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,160
And the problem is the benefit of sort of taking it slow is we can incorporate people's

1096
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,760
questions into the set as we're going.

1097
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:24,160
So that way if we miss something in one set, by the time we're recording the next set,

1098
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,800
so say we record episode one and two back to back.

1099
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,620
And then by the time we sit down to record episode three and four, to continue that,

1100
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,600
we can incorporate people's questions and sort of make the how to even better.

1101
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:40,080
But the other thing it lets us do is it really lets us give air to the topic.

1102
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,080
If we had to cram...

1103
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,920
I guess what I'm trying to say is if we could take one topic and really just serve that

1104
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,560
topic for four episodes in a stretch, we're going to get to all the nooks and crannies

1105
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,560
of that topic.

1106
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:56,540
Whereas if we have to do a completely new set every single week, just the production

1107
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:03,200
demands of pumping that out will mandate that not as much time is spent on that topic.

1108
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,200
Chris, I would...

1109
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,400
I know you thought about doing it with another show at some point, but ever thought maybe

1110
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,240
doing two parts per week.

1111
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,520
Maybe like one on Tuesday and one on Thursday or something.

1112
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,840
Yeah, we are kind of considering that too.

1113
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,360
The production is harder there, but it's something we're kind of kicking around is that might

1114
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,840
be a way to sort of speed the process up.

1115
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,840
Yeah.

1116
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:29,320
Also, you got to keep in mind too, you might want to do very like distro-specific things

1117
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:34,580
to like make an entire series about one specific distro, so like you can have an entire like

1118
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:42,520
OpenSUSE-related show, like doing like build service stuff, like things like that and then...

1119
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:48,880
Now, I got to ask a question here and obviously, here's a noob of me coming into play.

1120
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,840
Would that be because you have a preference to that particular version of Linux or is

1121
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:57,960
that because you think that would be a more generalization for the viewer?

1122
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:03,300
Because the one thing I want to be very, very careful about is saying, well, I think this

1123
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,320
particular version of Linux is better than this particular version of Linux and then

1124
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,880
you have infighting for people who will have their own favorite versions and distros.

1125
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,800
I've always kind of pictured rotating around.

1126
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,800
That's what I pictured too.

1127
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,360
Wait, let Poby get a chance because he's going to say something.

1128
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,360
Go ahead, Poby.

1129
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,360
Oh, sorry.

1130
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,640
Let me just interrupt playing Portal 2 on Linux.

1131
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,360
No, hold on a second.

1132
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,360
That gets in.

1133
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,360
There we go.

1134
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,360
Yeah, yeah.

1135
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,360
Very good.

1136
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:37,600
I'm inclined to agree with Rob, actually, I like the idea that you, episode one starts

1137
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:46,860
a series on a particular topic and you could do what a lot of, I've seen Unity 3D, introduction

1138
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:53,800
videos and Minecraft videos do where they record for a significant chunk of time to

1139
00:48:53,800 --> 00:49:00,320
give the topic plenty of detail and go into real depth, but you break it up and you just

1140
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:05,120
break it up into 10 minute slots and you cut it and put it out as a playlist.

1141
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:11,880
Now, the first episode goes out as episode one and then as you've said, 1A, 1B, 1C, and

1142
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,120
then the following week there's some completely different topic.

1143
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,640
It's not related to the previous week.

1144
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,760
It's not a continuation from the previous week.

1145
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,240
There's no dependency on you having watched any of the previous episodes.

1146
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:30,080
It's something new and fresh and that way you fulfill the being able to go in depth

1147
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,160
on a topic.

1148
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:36,400
You can punch out lots of episodes because you record it all in one long one hour stint,

1149
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:42,580
but chop it up into pieces so you get the continuation of a playlist and the thread

1150
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:48,440
of one topic, but you also get the benefit that you don't have to keep recording lots

1151
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,560
of different episodes that nobody is going to watch because they're all on a theme that

1152
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,640
nobody's interested in.

1153
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:00,220
So question here, playlists are very YouTube friendly, of course, but remember this is

1154
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:06,280
also going to be a downloadable show and so if I, for example, my podcatching feed had

1155
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:16,200
1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D, that's four things that are in my feed instead of one episode.

1156
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,840
So how would that be handled?

1157
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,480
I would like to kind of go against Popey's idea.

1158
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:26,320
I would say if we're going to stick to one topic a week, do two parts, one on one day

1159
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,360
and then another day of the week to still get that community feedback and questions

1160
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,360
that you can answer as Chris wanted to do.

1161
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:37,360
The problem is I don't want to have to wait a week to find out part two.

1162
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:45,280
If this is an in-depth thing, I want the immediacy of being able to go into plenty of detail

1163
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,880
about the entire topic if I have time to do it.

1164
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:55,160
I don't want to have to have a ten minute topic and then wait a week for the next ten

1165
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,160
minutes.

1166
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,880
I'm going to zone out.

1167
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,080
So Ick, why don't you chime in with sort of, you had a comment about the nature of

1168
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,080
podcasting.

1169
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,160
Yes, it's basically an on-demand medium.

1170
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:10,480
So what you're going to have is people picking and choosing what they want anyhow, whether

1171
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,280
they're going to want to watch this whole series on a particular topic or they're going

1172
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,400
to want to skip over that and just wait for the next one.

1173
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,320
Sadly, you know, you're not going to be able to please all the people all the time with

1174
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,320
that.

1175
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,320
That's true.

1176
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,960
Q5, you had a comment about the distro.

1177
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah, I think if you use a distro, like let's say we're talking about how to set up NGINX

1178
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,440
and own cloud on a box somewhere where we're using Debian as our example.

1179
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,680
We can run the whole how to with using say Debian as the example and then at the very

1180
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,640
end have a short blurb that says, okay, now if you're using Arch, you may have to change,

1181
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,600
you know, things here, here, here, or if you're using Slackware, you know, you might need

1182
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,680
to find Slack build scripts or other things.

1183
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,520
That way you can focus on one distro, get the information out there and then also touch

1184
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,520
on if you're using another distro, here are some things you might want to take a note

1185
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,560
of before you go down the road.

1186
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,960
And Fate, you wanted to also comment about distros.

1187
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,420
Yeah, I was actually going to suggest the same thing.

1188
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:14,160
If you focus on one particular distro from start to finish and exclude acknowledging

1189
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,480
other distros, then you're targeting a subset of a subset and I don't think that'd be as

1190
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:24,040
beneficial to people as trying to be as all inclusive as possible.

1191
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,720
So I kind of, you know, I love the idea of maybe like a sort of like a middle ground

1192
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,360
where it's you split it up, but it's two releases in a one week.

1193
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:36,800
The problem with that is right now resources, that might be something we do, you know, maybe

1194
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,080
a couple of months down the road.

1195
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:44,240
I don't know, because that would require probably that we have our editor in place.

1196
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,320
On Popi's point, instead of 10 minute segments, when you're structuring the show and you're

1197
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:52,800
writing the notes, you could write them as different segments, like you currently segment

1198
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,000
last right now, right?

1199
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,520
And then choose, you know, depending on how many segments are available for that particular

1200
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,880
show, how you're going to do the release structure.

1201
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:07,160
I mean, it's one of those things that maybe the show, I mean, this is right now, it's

1202
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,960
all very fluid, but maybe the show needs to be a full length show, not small.

1203
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:12,960
And I know-

1204
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:13,960
I think that's a problem.

1205
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,880
It is a problem, but it's, I guess it all comes down to the topic at hand, right?

1206
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,880
Yeah.

1207
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,080
I was just thinking like, even the segment idea is kind of hard because like sometimes

1208
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,880
that part takes five minutes and sometimes that part will take a half hour.

1209
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,880
Right.

1210
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:28,880
Yeah.

1211
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,880
That's challenging.

1212
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,880
Right.

1213
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,520
I mean, I think obviously at the beginning of the show, you know, I say episodes one

1214
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:39,600
through five, I doubt that we're going to get into anything that requires multiple parts

1215
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,400
because remember, this is a how to Linux show.

1216
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:49,000
We're taking baby steps or we're taking baby steps with me and I don't see us getting into

1217
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,520
something that's going to require a baby step approach, at least in the beginning, because

1218
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,100
you know, remember, we're trying to appeal to a general audience.

1219
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:01,060
It's not just the advanced audiences, but also the people who are wanting to learn more

1220
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,060
about Linux.

1221
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:06,680
If you're going to give somebody a five step process for someone to learn more about Linux,

1222
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,320
you might lose them already because they'll be like, wow, really?

1223
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:13,340
I need to go through a five step course to learn about this particular thing that I want

1224
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:14,340
to do?

1225
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,340
I don't know.

1226
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,000
I see, I think that's looking at it from the wrong angle.

1227
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,560
I think it's more going back to like what Iq was saying of the on demand nature of it

1228
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,080
where a lot of people look at it and say, well, I don't need to know how to install

1229
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,080
a package.

1230
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:29,400
I know how to install a package, but I need to know is how to set up this part of it.

1231
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,400
Right.

1232
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,880
And I think that's the advantage of having it broken up a little bit is people can pick

1233
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,280
and choose the components that meet their skill set.

1234
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,280
Yeah, that's true.

1235
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,840
Well, like when I'm looking at something for Kdenlive, for example, that's actually something

1236
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:41,840
I've run into.

1237
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,200
I can use video editors and Linux six ways from Sunday, but there's always like that.

1238
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,240
It's always forget like the process of compositing that I always forget that.

1239
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,860
So I have to like look for that piece of it to remember how to do it.

1240
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,360
And I don't want to watch an entire show on it.

1241
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,120
So I think having the segment definitely helps.

1242
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,120
Okay.

1243
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:59,840
I kind of want to bring up this concern is, okay, playlists are very YouTube friendly,

1244
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,120
but what are we going to do when we put it on, let's say, the Jupiter Broadcasting website?

1245
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,120
Right.

1246
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:07,360
That's the yeah, I think I think basing around playlists is only get you so far.

1247
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,160
I think that is a problem as SM, SMA, SSA.

1248
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,160
What did you want to say?

1249
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,160
SMASA.

1250
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,160
SMASA.

1251
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,160
Yeah, SMASA.

1252
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:18,400
I just wanted to say that you want this to be an archive of how to do different things

1253
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,400
in Linux.

1254
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,520
So I don't think you should really be that strict about how long each individual show

1255
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,520
is.

1256
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,520
Yeah.

1257
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,900
You should try to do whatever it is as fast as possible, but still be effective and leave

1258
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:28,900
that up to the topic.

1259
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,900
Yeah.

1260
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:30,900
Yeah.

1261
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:31,900
I think that's going to have to happen either way.

1262
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:35,400
I mean, I don't think like we could just cut it off if something was going long because

1263
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,240
the content will always sort of drive that.

1264
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,240
And that's it, you guys.

1265
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,240
That's all we have time.

1266
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,640
We really want to show you how to get that started.

1267
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,640
But we're going to have to run.

1268
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,000
But we ran out of film, you know, the camera, the batteries.

1269
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Yeah.

1270
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Yeah.

1271
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
So, boy, I don't know.

1272
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,760
So it sounds like this is still something I want to kind of try to refine because I think

1273
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,960
this is a key part to how to deliver this show.

1274
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,840
And I think part of it is like there's two audiences we're trying to solve or trying

1275
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,080
to serve.

1276
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:05,000
One is the weekly people that will want to tune in and see what we're working on.

1277
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,120
And the other was going to be the people who will be coming across the archive in a year

1278
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,440
from now when they're trying to implement that project they want to get done.

1279
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:16,320
And it's too bad you can't do like chapter breaks like on a DVD.

1280
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,320
Right?

1281
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,320
Yeah.

1282
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,160
We'll release each one of the DVD.

1283
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:26,000
Now, you could release a playlist file on the website included with like a zip or a

1284
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,360
tar jizz or something, although, I mean, is this even a podcast format?

1285
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,240
You had to say it like that, didn't you?

1286
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,240
Yes, tar jizz, jizz, whatever.

1287
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,240
Okay.

1288
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,240
Okay.

1289
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,240
All right.

1290
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,240
All right.

1291
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,240
I somehow knew I'd get that response.

1292
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,800
It was not intentional, but.

1293
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:50,120
Well, why not having it so you have one episode, say, the lamp stack.

1294
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:54,880
You have one episode about the introduction, and that gets people to say, this is the episodes

1295
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,880
about this.

1296
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,720
And then on the show notes, there are multiple parts.

1297
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,840
They can jump to different posts.

1298
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:04,360
So everything's still self-contained in the one episode, but it's split up so people can

1299
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,840
see what they can get to the sections that they want to.

1300
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,740
And in this way, you could benefit having it archived on the website and archiving

1301
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:15,000
it on YouTube and doing playlists and having it all, you know, organized however you want

1302
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
to in different mediums.

1303
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
That makes sense.

1304
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,800
It kind of sounds to me like you want to fulfill two requirements, one, which is have the people

1305
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,840
who are going to download a chunky video and will be happy to sit there and go through

1306
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:32,520
it and pause it and, you know, continue and jump ahead or whatever.

1307
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,520
Yeah.

1308
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:38,360
Whereas you also want the short attention span YouTube audience who will watch a ten

1309
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,200
minute video and then, you know, disappear and then maybe come back for the next ten

1310
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:45,200
minute video in the series.

1311
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,920
That's three ten minute videos in a playlist or one sixty minute video.

1312
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,320
So it's basically a sixty minute video.

1313
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,040
You chop into three, put it on a playlist, you're done.

1314
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,040
Yeah.

1315
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,040
Yeah.

1316
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,040
Yeah.

1317
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,040
I like what Popey was saying.

1318
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:02,400
Like for your actual website, you put the one final episode and then you put the split

1319
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,800
parts on YouTube.

1320
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,440
I don't even I don't I don't really like designing any aspect of the show for YouTube.

1321
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,720
I don't even like thinking about YouTube.

1322
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,720
Makes me so frustrated.

1323
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,680
Riley's been trying to get a point in about production.

1324
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,400
Go ahead, Riley.

1325
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,400
Yes.

1326
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,400
That's what I was going to say about YouTube, too, is like you have to make sure the production

1327
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:27,920
is good on it and you do keep people entertained because a lot of the shows like it's the people

1328
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,520
who do it at Austin are kind of weird sometimes.

1329
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,520
Yeah.

1330
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:38,200
My observation, you know, from some that I've checked out is they're too slow and they're

1331
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:43,000
spending way too much time sort of with the introduction and the and the talking about

1332
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,160
themselves and all this kind of stuff instead of just hitting the ground running.

1333
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:50,820
And I really look at it from that that mindset of somebody who wants to come in and solve

1334
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:51,820
a problem.

1335
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:55,920
And I really think that's the person that, you know, you know, in terms of who we can

1336
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:01,220
help and and and who we can provide, you know, more more resources for people looking to

1337
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,220
switch to Linux.

1338
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,920
I feel like that's the person to serve.

1339
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,640
But I still want to make it palatable to everyone else, too, in some way.

1340
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,640
So I think.

1341
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,640
Yeah.

1342
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,640
Go ahead.

1343
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:15,960
You know, this really isn't necessarily a podcast is this we don't really need a format

1344
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,640
in a method that would go out to a podcast catcher or anything.

1345
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,640
We do.

1346
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,640
I don't know.

1347
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,560
I think maybe that's why I was thinking maybe still having a final version that is sort

1348
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,240
of a longer show type format.

1349
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,240
Yeah.

1350
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,160
Well, and I think from a podcast version, the one of the advantages is that it allows

1351
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:36,400
you to build up your own personal library of stuff we know and stuff we're sharing.

1352
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,020
So you may not even really need to watch that video right away.

1353
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:42,200
But then later on, think, oh, crap, what was that one thing?

1354
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,480
And then you have it stored locally.

1355
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,560
Some people do want that local media.

1356
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,640
They don't necessarily want to watch it online.

1357
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,640
Yeah.

1358
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,640
Hmm.

1359
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,640
All right.

1360
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,800
Well, it sounds like we'll do some more discussions.

1361
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,720
But thanks for all you know, thanks for giving us a lot to think about, you guys.

1362
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,720
That's good input to take there.

1363
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,720
Yeah, absolutely.

1364
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:58,720
Thank you.

1365
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,720
All right.

1366
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,720
Well, we got an email from Todd.

1367
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,920
He wrote and says, Hey, guys, I've been going through this long experiment to get rid of

1368
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:06,520
Google in my life and trying to find Linux devices for mobile use is hurting me right

1369
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,520
now.

1370
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:12,120
I was on CyanogenMod for the time being, but Google has ripped so much out of Aesop that

1371
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,200
it's really leaving a lot to be desired.

1372
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:18,720
Would you consider doing a call out for feedback from people using OpenPandora or any of those

1373
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,760
crazy Chinese gadgets like or the Yolo phone or something like that?

1374
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,480
Then you could share their feedback on the show and put it in the show notes.

1375
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:30,680
I really want to buy an OpenPandora one gigahertz model, but that's a lot of money to spend

1376
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,120
on something that might or might not work out.

1377
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:36,720
If a listener was able to give some feedback and on its use for messaging, SIP and Linux

1378
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,480
apps in general, I'd make it a lot easier for me.

1379
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:44,040
He's also going to post in the Jupiter Colony and on the G Plus Jupiter Colony.

1380
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:49,480
Well, I live in Kansas, so I'm trying to get more Google in my life.

1381
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,480
The fiber kind.

1382
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,480
Yeah.

1383
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,480
All right.

1384
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,480
So John wrote in, I call it the possible downsides of acceptance.

1385
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,800
He said, So I definitely agree that getting more people to use Linux is great for the

1386
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,920
desktop and Linux as a whole.

1387
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,320
But what if, say, for example, Canonical dominated the Linux space and slowly inched towards

1388
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,560
a closed source system like Windows or Mac OS?

1389
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,520
Do you think that this is a potential issue?

1390
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,700
If something like that happened, then real Linux would be stuck where it currently stands

1391
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:20,680
in which a big shot OS that dominates the market would then enslave all of their users

1392
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:24,040
and all the new stuff that Linux people are left out in the cold.

1393
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:27,500
What are your thoughts on this matter, John?

1394
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,240
So I don't think this is really quite the same.

1395
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,920
I think I hear this comparison a lot and I don't think this is really quite the same

1396
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,360
and it really kind of comes down to license, I think.

1397
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:42,240
I think you look at companies like, or distros like Mint and other things, it kind of proves

1398
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,240
that, in a sense.

1399
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:48,000
So where Mac or Windows could come in and sort of brace and extend and then dry out

1400
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
all the competition, that's not really an option for things that are based on the GPL

1401
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
as much.

1402
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
It's a possibility, I suppose.

1403
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,800
And then that would be the market deciding, right?

1404
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,800
This is true.

1405
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:01,280
I think they're confusing the word, the joke about Mark being a dictator with an actual

1406
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,280
dictator.

1407
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,280
Yes.

1408
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,280
Welcome to Putin OS.

1409
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,280
Yeah.

1410
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,280
Okay.

1411
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,280
All right.

1412
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,280
But John, so I wouldn't worry about it.

1413
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:14,160
I think the license has shown that if anything, things rise and fall and then at the end of

1414
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,680
the day, it's all GPLed code and that's kind of what matters in the end.

1415
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,600
Well, lots to think about and we'd love to hear your thoughts on the how-to show as well

1416
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:28,360
and probably the best way to send us your ideas because the Linux action show inbox

1417
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,840
is ridiculous right now.

1418
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,440
I bet it is.

1419
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,680
We got so many emails.

1420
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:37,280
But if you want to shoot your ideas to at HowToLinux on the Twitter, twitter.com slash

1421
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,280
HowToLinux.

1422
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:42,760
We'll be monitoring that for ideas and suggestions and we'll also be eventually posting notifications

1423
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,720
when the show gets closer to launch and when we're doing stuff, we'll be posting it there.

1424
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,920
Not a lot happening at the moment because the show is still obviously in the early stages

1425
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,040
but that'd be a good spot to follow so that way you can get updates but you can also send

1426
01:02:54,040 --> 01:03:01,000
us ideas, topic ideas, format ideas and all that kind of stuff at HowToLinux on the Twitter.

1427
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
All right.

1428
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,120
Well, thank you very much Mumble Room for joining us.

1429
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:07,040
You guys were great as always and gave us a lot to think about and thanks to Brendan

1430
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:10,880
for writing in or for calling in and talking to me about the Clementine OS project.

1431
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,360
And Chase, thanks to you for joining us.

1432
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,080
Hey, you know, it's always fun being here.

1433
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:18,020
You know, I feel very comfortable for me to be here with you guys so thank you so much

1434
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:19,020
for having me here.

1435
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,720
Well, you keep that seat warm because you'll be sitting right there again tomorrow for

1436
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:22,720
Unfiltered.

1437
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,680
Yeah, why don't you put that other chair together so I have a much more comfortable seat.

1438
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,680
Why don't you put that chair together?

1439
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,680
Come on, man.

1440
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,680
I'm in a folding chair here.

1441
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:28,680
You're sitting in like my naked.

1442
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,680
I know.

1443
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,680
Well, this chair is no good either.

1444
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:31,680
This chair is no good.

1445
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:36,600
Well, Matt, if all goes as planned, on Sunday we'll be chatting with one of the new folks

1446
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:40,900
at the KDE Design Group who are working on the next version of the Plasma desktop to

1447
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,300
make it look even better.

1448
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,300
So that'll be a good chat.

1449
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,520
And did you see, by the way, the Numix folks made the official announcement about their

1450
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,920
new desktop they're going to be working on?

1451
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,480
You can find that on their G Plus feed and go check that out.

1452
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,360
Also, don't forget you can join us live on a Tuesday at 2 p.m. over at jblive.tv.

1453
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:59,800
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your own local time

1454
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,800
zone.

1455
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,800
You'll have our mumble room.

1456
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,800
You join the chat room.

1457
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,280
Do bang mumble and you'll get the mumble server address and you can hang out in our virtual

1458
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,320
log and chat with us in real time.

1459
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,320
And we have that open to everybody.

1460
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:12,180
If you're working on a project and you want to spread the word, just let us know.

1461
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:14,180
And we'll have we have a lot of good stuff coming up.

1462
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:16,360
We got a lot of good stuff in the works.

1463
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,360
Great stuff in the works.

1464
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:20,120
And don't forget to go to teespring.com slash last 300.

1465
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,880
Get yourself a shirt and a challenge coin.

1466
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:23,880
All right, everyone.

1467
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,160
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1468
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:31,160
If we don't see you on Sunday, we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1469
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:56,340
Have a great day.
