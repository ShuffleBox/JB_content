WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.880
Wes, did you see that the Fedora 31 beta came out today?

00:02.880 --> 00:03.560
Oh, no.

00:03.560 --> 00:05.000
That's exciting.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.440
I'm already jonesing for it.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.320
But I was looking at it, something in there

00:08.320 --> 00:09.320
has me a little nervous.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.800
They're switching from cgroups1 to cgroups2.

00:11.800 --> 00:12.520
Upgrade.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.000
Don't really understand what that means.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.540
And one of the things they say in there

00:15.540 --> 00:18.720
is, if your tool expects cgroups1, it may break.

00:18.720 --> 00:22.560
And I'm thinking, well, what tool is that?

00:22.560 --> 00:24.200
Is that one of my tools?

00:24.200 --> 00:24.720
I don't know.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.340
You're going to have to read the docs, Chris.

00:26.340 --> 00:27.360
I'm already looking forward to it, though.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.040
I got the itch.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.840
I got up this morning, and my laptop was like,

00:29.840 --> 00:30.640
hey, can we upgrade?

00:30.640 --> 00:32.480
And I'm like, no, laptop, it's a beta.

00:32.480 --> 00:33.480
You know how it does that?

00:33.480 --> 00:33.960
Right.

00:33.960 --> 00:35.440
So then I'm moving along, and it's like, hey, Chris.

00:35.440 --> 00:36.280
I'm like, what laptop?

00:36.280 --> 00:38.180
And it's like, I'd like to do an upgrade to Fedora 31.

00:38.180 --> 00:39.520
It's got that new gnome shell.

00:39.520 --> 00:42.260
And I'm like, no, the beta just came out today, laptop.

00:42.260 --> 00:42.760
Stop it.

00:42.760 --> 00:43.640
Calm down.

00:43.640 --> 00:44.160
Yeah.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.240
And then I get to the studio today.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.000
It's like, hey, Chris.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.160
Hey, Chris, you got fast internet here.

00:47.160 --> 00:48.280
You could do the update.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.720
You won't leave me alone, Wes.

00:49.720 --> 00:51.640
You know, I'm honestly very impressed

00:51.640 --> 00:52.640
you've made it this far.

00:52.640 --> 00:53.800
I don't want to do the beta.

00:53.800 --> 00:54.760
I don't want to run a beta.

00:54.760 --> 01:00.440
But my laptop won't shut up about it.

01:00.440 --> 01:01.520
On your machine.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.020
What?

01:02.020 --> 01:14.120
Hello there, and welcome into Linux Unplugged, episode 319.

01:14.120 --> 01:14.920
My name is Chris.

01:14.920 --> 01:15.760
My name is Wes.

01:15.760 --> 01:16.320
Hello, Wes.

01:16.320 --> 01:16.880
Hello.

01:16.880 --> 01:17.600
Big show today.

01:17.600 --> 01:18.720
Huge show.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.940
We have not one but two guests joining us today

01:20.940 --> 01:24.240
to explain various things that need explained,

01:24.240 --> 01:27.760
and of course, we have some big community news to get into,

01:27.760 --> 01:31.000
as well as some new releases of one of our favorite tools.

01:31.000 --> 01:31.560
Oh, boy.

01:31.560 --> 01:32.200
That's right.

01:32.200 --> 01:32.760
That's right.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.800
We've got some other community events to share with you,

01:34.800 --> 01:35.680
as well as some pics.

01:35.680 --> 01:38.120
We've got, well, you could say like a whole rack of a show.

01:38.120 --> 01:40.240
Like, it's not like a half rack of a show.

01:40.240 --> 01:40.960
Big rack, yeah.

01:40.960 --> 01:42.680
Yeah, it's a full rack.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.980
So to really help us dig into all of this,

01:44.980 --> 01:47.480
we really got to say hello over there to Mr. Cheese and Mr.

01:47.480 --> 01:47.720
Alex.

01:47.720 --> 01:48.240
Hey, guys.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.160
Well, hello, guys.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.280
Buongiorno.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.000
Hey, make yourself comfortable.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.720
Make sure you grab yourself a cup of water there.

01:53.720 --> 01:54.840
Wes brought in water for everybody.

01:54.840 --> 01:55.800
Of course.

01:55.800 --> 01:56.960
And thanks for joining us.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.000
And sparkling, by the way.

01:58.000 --> 01:58.520
Sparkling.

01:58.520 --> 01:59.520
Oh, really?

01:59.520 --> 02:00.640
Nice, Wes.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.440
Everybody's going to have the burps now, though.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.480
Oh, whoops.

02:03.480 --> 02:05.020
And also, time-appropriate greetings

02:05.020 --> 02:05.680
to that mumble room.

02:05.680 --> 02:06.600
Hello, virtual lug.

02:06.600 --> 02:07.100
Hello.

02:07.100 --> 02:08.080
Hello, hello, hello.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.440
Hello.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.200
I'm noticing we not only have a nice showing there

02:12.200 --> 02:14.440
in the main mumble room, but we've got a good show

02:14.440 --> 02:16.800
in there in the quiet listening, the low-latency listening,

02:16.800 --> 02:19.000
as we call it, there in the mumble room.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.560
I think it's like one of the best low-latency, low-bandwidth

02:21.560 --> 02:22.320
ways to listen to the show.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.160
Like you're right here in studio with us, basically.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.640
You do get a special studio mix.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.040
And we're glad to see you there.

02:27.040 --> 02:27.560
That's true.

02:27.560 --> 02:28.400
That's true.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.000
Well, let's start things off with some community news

02:31.000 --> 02:34.080
that I'm honestly a little shocked to start with.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.200
Today, as we record, it's been announced

02:36.200 --> 02:37.760
that Richard Stallman has resigned

02:37.760 --> 02:41.080
as president and director of the Free Software Foundation

02:41.080 --> 02:43.240
and from the MIT CSAIL?

02:43.240 --> 02:44.160
Is that how we say it?

02:44.160 --> 02:44.720
CSAIL.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.840
CSAIL department over his comments

02:46.840 --> 02:49.520
related to Jeffrey Epstein.

02:49.520 --> 02:50.440
Huge.

02:50.440 --> 02:55.000
First, in order of events, I saw the announcement about MIT.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.280
And then I saw the announcement directly

02:57.280 --> 02:58.920
from the Free Software Foundation.

02:58.920 --> 03:02.120
They write, on September 16, 2019,

03:02.120 --> 03:04.280
Richard M. Stallman, the founder and president

03:04.280 --> 03:07.920
of the Free Software Foundation, resigned as president

03:07.920 --> 03:09.400
and from its board of directors.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.820
The board will be conducting a search for the new president

03:11.820 --> 03:13.800
beginning immediately.

03:13.800 --> 03:20.040
You can find more details on fsf.org when they know more.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.920
This is huge.

03:21.920 --> 03:26.000
And it's been also something of a bit of a fascination of mine

03:26.000 --> 03:29.880
to watch the mainstream media begin to report this story.

03:29.880 --> 03:32.260
It's connected to a huge scandal now.

03:32.260 --> 03:34.760
And they refer to him as computer scientist

03:34.760 --> 03:36.640
and open software advocate.

03:36.640 --> 03:37.400
Oh, boy.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.320
Wow.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.640
He has resigned.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.300
The scandal tied to Jeffrey Epstein

03:45.300 --> 03:49.040
is related to $7.5 million in donations

03:49.040 --> 03:51.760
that he gave to the MIT Media Lab, which

03:51.760 --> 03:54.680
was far more than what was previously disclosed

03:54.680 --> 03:59.160
than the group inside MIT was discussing this issue when

03:59.160 --> 04:02.060
Richard Stallman made his views about some of the victims

04:02.060 --> 04:03.320
clear.

04:03.320 --> 04:07.080
Parts of that quote were then picked up by the media

04:07.080 --> 04:09.120
after it was blogged about.

04:09.120 --> 04:11.400
And it's really kind of over the last few days

04:11.400 --> 04:13.760
since we recorded, it's turned into quite a firestorm.

04:13.760 --> 04:14.640
Absolutely.

04:14.640 --> 04:15.840
Kind of blew up, right?

04:15.840 --> 04:19.760
We got insight into what seemed like indefensible remarks.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.840
And Stallman has a long history, kind of brought that back

04:23.840 --> 04:24.680
to light, too.

04:24.680 --> 04:26.520
One of the things that I saw was it

04:26.520 --> 04:29.520
was a new group of individuals that

04:29.520 --> 04:32.880
were learning about his views on certain topics that didn't

04:32.880 --> 04:35.620
previously know about that.

04:35.620 --> 04:39.240
Some of us, we've gone to his website over the last decade

04:39.240 --> 04:41.660
plus, we know what his views are on some of these things

04:41.660 --> 04:45.200
and have considered it to be a little gross for a while.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.720
But a new round of individuals over this last weekend,

04:47.720 --> 04:49.680
really kind of starting the middle of last week,

04:49.680 --> 04:52.520
discovered some of these things.

04:52.520 --> 04:56.600
But I think what I believe is important to take here

04:56.600 --> 05:00.600
from all of this is we shouldn't frame the conversation

05:00.600 --> 05:04.240
as a reaction to comments that Richard Stallman made

05:04.240 --> 05:06.460
about Jeffrey Epstein's victims.

05:06.460 --> 05:10.400
This is really the end result of a pattern of behavior

05:10.400 --> 05:14.900
over decades that has eventually led to some kind of response.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.840
I think we all kind of knew this was likely

05:16.840 --> 05:18.080
coming for Richard Stallman.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.480
Those of us that have followed this for a while.

05:19.480 --> 05:19.720
Right.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.720
And I think you're right.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.280
At least in the wider community, he's

05:22.280 --> 05:26.040
mostly known for his fairly extreme philosophies

05:26.040 --> 05:28.600
and ideas about free software, at least viewed that way

05:28.600 --> 05:29.560
by many.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.160
But there is this undercurrent.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.360
And if you've been paying attention,

05:33.360 --> 05:34.480
this has always been there.

05:34.480 --> 05:37.960
Yeah, you followed this pretty closely for Linux headlines.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.920
And there was a moment where it seemed like something was

05:40.920 --> 05:43.160
going to have to give pretty soon.

05:43.160 --> 05:43.960
Yeah, absolutely.

05:43.960 --> 05:47.000
Well, over the weekend, both the Software Freedom Conservancy

05:47.000 --> 05:49.760
made a statement saying that Richard Stallman shouldn't

05:49.760 --> 05:51.040
have this position anymore.

05:51.040 --> 05:54.480
And then the executive director of the Gnome Foundation

05:54.480 --> 05:56.900
said that in his view, the foundations

05:56.900 --> 06:00.600
could no longer have a formal relationship

06:00.600 --> 06:02.240
if Richard Stallman was still there.

06:02.240 --> 06:02.920
Wow.

06:02.920 --> 06:05.760
Yeah, they write, we admire the work

06:05.760 --> 06:07.760
that the Free Software Foundation staffers

06:07.760 --> 06:08.920
and volunteers have done.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.000
But we have reached a point concluding

06:11.000 --> 06:14.120
that the greatest service to the mission of free software

06:14.120 --> 06:16.920
is for Richard to step down from the SFF.

06:16.920 --> 06:22.200
And if this doesn't happen, then they'll look at, as they write,

06:22.200 --> 06:25.520
severing the historical ties between Gnome, Gnu,

06:25.520 --> 06:27.200
and the Free Software Foundation.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.060
And that would be the only path forward.

06:30.060 --> 06:31.520
Wow.

06:31.520 --> 06:34.240
Like, that was, I mean, something had to break here.

06:34.240 --> 06:34.760
Absolutely.

06:34.760 --> 06:38.280
And when I saw this happen, because this

06:38.280 --> 06:40.600
was before Richard Stallman's announcements,

06:40.600 --> 06:44.840
I thought to myself, the FSF is going to go down with Stallman.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.240
The two are inseparable.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.440
They are linked.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.240
You can't have one without the other.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.360
That certainly has seemed that way for years.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.840
I was really shocked when I saw this.

06:53.840 --> 06:56.840
But I think it's not super surprising.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.040
Richard Stallman probably wants to take

06:59.040 --> 07:02.120
whatever actions he thinks are best for the longevity

07:02.120 --> 07:03.520
of the foundation.

07:03.520 --> 07:06.240
And it's probably better for the community as a whole

07:06.240 --> 07:10.920
if we don't have someone with this history representing us.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.560
So I think Richard Stallman probably

07:13.560 --> 07:15.880
knew that this was the best move he had to make.

07:15.880 --> 07:18.240
There's a famous quote of Richard Stallman's

07:18.240 --> 07:21.600
that I shared with the team when the news was announced.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.920
And I kind of feel like it's appropriate to read it here

07:23.920 --> 07:28.280
on the show, because it's like one of those prescient quotes

07:28.280 --> 07:31.040
from the man himself, where there's that meme

07:31.040 --> 07:33.120
that Richard Stallman was right.

07:33.120 --> 07:37.960
Well, he even has a quote that sort of summarizes this.

07:37.960 --> 07:42.240
Geeks like to think that they can ignore politics.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.400
You can leave politics alone, but politics

07:45.400 --> 07:46.960
won't leave you alone.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.000
He's right.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.020
And that's exactly what happened here.

07:50.020 --> 07:53.720
I'm definitely along the same lines as you,

07:53.720 --> 07:57.520
as far as it's been a discovery, a week of discovery

07:57.520 --> 08:02.720
for a lot of people, where we knew after reading his blog,

08:02.720 --> 08:06.800
there are questionable things in his blog.

08:06.800 --> 08:10.780
I always had kind of a weird feeling about the guy myself,

08:10.780 --> 08:15.240
but what he's done for the Free Software Foundation

08:15.240 --> 08:18.360
and that movement has gotten it to where it is today.

08:18.360 --> 08:22.040
I'm glad that he is willing to just step down and let

08:22.040 --> 08:26.020
the Free Software Foundation continue with, quite frankly,

08:26.020 --> 08:27.400
better leadership.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.600
All right, well, moving on then.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.980
Let's talk about something that's

08:30.980 --> 08:34.320
pretty exciting for owners of the Raspberry Pi.

08:34.320 --> 08:39.320
There is a first fully functional 64-bit OS

08:39.320 --> 08:43.000
for the Raspberry Pi 4, because right now it's 32-bit only,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
even though it's a 64-bit device.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.640
But who it's from is a bit of a surprise, Wes.

08:47.640 --> 08:50.760
Yeah, it's our friends over at Balena.

08:50.760 --> 08:51.960
Now, if you don't remember.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.600
Yeah, the Etcher people.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.560
But it turns out they do a lot more than that, too.

08:56.560 --> 08:57.600
Yes, that's very true.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.320
OK, so if you don't remember, Balena OS

08:59.320 --> 09:02.680
is an open source, minimal, Yocto Linux-based,

09:02.680 --> 09:06.120
host operating system that's designed for containers.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.720
It enables a fast and modern workflow

09:07.720 --> 09:09.600
for many different embedded device types,

09:09.600 --> 09:12.000
and now includes the Raspberry Pi 4.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.640
Basically, they've got a system in place

09:13.640 --> 09:16.040
to take modern workflows that you might be used to

09:16.040 --> 09:18.040
on the server, building a new container image,

09:18.040 --> 09:20.720
pushing that up to test, and then eventually into production

09:20.720 --> 09:24.280
and make that work on embedded and IoT applications.

09:24.280 --> 09:27.040
So now you can get the 64-bit goodness

09:27.040 --> 09:31.600
and run side-by-side 32-bit and 64-bit Docker containers

09:31.600 --> 09:32.440
on your Pi.

09:32.440 --> 09:36.820
I kind of like this, because I'm using the Pi exclusively

09:36.820 --> 09:38.980
right now to run Docker containers.

09:38.980 --> 09:44.880
And I did kind of pine about not having a 64-bit OS when

09:44.880 --> 09:46.960
I was loading it up to do server stuff.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.200
And one of the things I didn't fully appreciate

09:49.200 --> 09:51.340
when I bought the Raspberry Pi 4 is

09:51.340 --> 09:54.200
I was buying a machine to run Raspbian,

09:54.200 --> 09:57.280
and pretty much only Raspbian.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.760
When you look at some of the things

09:58.760 --> 10:02.480
that they had to overcome to even make this thing possible,

10:02.480 --> 10:04.560
it's clear that it's going to take a long time

10:04.560 --> 10:06.840
before most distros are supporting the Raspberry Pi 4.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.740
Yeah, I mean, basically, there's been a lot of hardware changes,

10:09.740 --> 10:11.520
and you're trying to move over to 64-bit.

10:11.520 --> 10:15.240
So they had to improve stuff in Yocto for the board support

10:15.240 --> 10:19.520
package changes, all that stuff for the Funarm platform,

10:19.520 --> 10:20.920
and work with their bootloader.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.880
Yeah, the bootloader, the way you initialize the graphics,

10:23.880 --> 10:27.560
the way you initialize the PCI bus, all weird and different.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.080
It's all different on the Pi 4.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.480
So I'll be running Raspbian for a while, I think.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.840
However, you and I very momentarily

10:34.840 --> 10:37.160
did get CentOS running on the Raspberry Pi 4.

10:37.160 --> 10:37.920
Yes, we did.

10:37.920 --> 10:38.520
That was fun.

10:38.520 --> 10:39.800
That was fun.

10:39.800 --> 10:44.640
We had to get it working on a Raspberry Pi 3 first, right?

10:44.640 --> 10:45.800
Isn't that what we did?

10:45.800 --> 10:47.720
And then we patched the kernel on the SD card

10:47.720 --> 10:49.160
and then booted it on the Raspberry Pi 4.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.840
Thankfully, some kind of community member

10:50.840 --> 10:52.840
out there had built an updated version,

10:52.840 --> 10:54.520
but that was what you had to do before.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.320
That's what they did.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.720
Right, right, yeah.

10:56.720 --> 10:59.960
It was kind of awesome, though, to have CentOS on a Pi 4.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.160
But it was 32-bit as well.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.880
So BalenaOS.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.680
You know, it is neat to just see because they're leveraging

11:06.680 --> 11:09.800
open source distributions and a bunch of the open source

11:09.800 --> 11:11.960
Mobi-based tooling for Docker to build

11:11.960 --> 11:13.120
their customized platform.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.160
Yeah.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.640
Let's talk about Nextcloud.

11:15.640 --> 11:20.760
Nextcloud 17 is out, and there's some pretty nice features

11:20.760 --> 11:21.640
in here.

11:21.640 --> 11:25.840
The one that really jumps out to me is remote wipe.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.560
All right, so if you permit downloading of documents

11:28.560 --> 11:31.120
by a third party, you can now wipe the documents

11:31.120 --> 11:33.200
from the devices after you're done collaborating.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.880
So maybe you have a few sensitive things.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.560
You want someone to assess a pre-release of something

11:37.560 --> 11:39.160
and they don't need access afterwards,

11:39.160 --> 11:40.720
Nextcloud can make it happen.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.760
It is a little creepy, though, right?

11:42.760 --> 11:44.960
I mean, once I download something,

11:44.960 --> 11:45.960
kind of want to keep it.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.560
Yeah, I don't see how it could work

11:47.560 --> 11:51.800
without either a Nextcloud client installed

11:51.800 --> 11:55.400
or you go back to the website and next time you revisit,

11:55.400 --> 11:57.240
somehow it could remove those files.

11:57.240 --> 11:59.360
But I think it's got to be tied into the client.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.560
So it's only of certain probably usefulness.

12:01.560 --> 12:04.600
However, definitely had a scenario one time

12:04.600 --> 12:06.320
where a client had Dropbox where it

12:06.320 --> 12:08.300
was one of those random implementations

12:08.300 --> 12:11.080
where the staff just started using it to share files around.

12:11.080 --> 12:13.600
And then they worked with a contractor who took off

12:13.600 --> 12:17.200
and took off with the folder on their hard drive.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.000
Yeah, I mean, really, that's the story here.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.640
This is an enterprise-friendly feature

12:20.640 --> 12:23.000
and might make it easier for some people to adopt it.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.800
Yeah, they've also been trying to make a bit of a showcase

12:25.800 --> 12:28.760
out of some of their larger government installations

12:28.760 --> 12:31.960
and better support for two-factor authentication.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.440
Now, during the initial sign-up and login process,

12:34.440 --> 12:37.240
a user can set up two-factor authentication and more

12:37.240 --> 12:39.640
services than ever are supported these days, like gateways

12:39.640 --> 12:40.400
that use SMS.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.800
Of course, you have your standard one-time password

12:42.800 --> 12:45.520
services for like Google Authenticator or similar apps.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.640
So they're really all in on the two-factor authentication

12:47.640 --> 12:48.320
now with this release.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.000
That's good to see.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.840
It does look nice, because we're using Nextcloud these days.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.500
Guess that means it's time to update, Wes.

12:53.500 --> 12:54.120
I think it is.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.480
It's time to update.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.600
Well, let's take a moment and talk about something

12:57.600 --> 12:58.780
a little different.

12:58.780 --> 13:01.080
So in our community is an individual

13:01.080 --> 13:03.960
who's an advocate for PowerShell.

13:03.960 --> 13:07.040
DM is active in several communities,

13:07.040 --> 13:10.760
and he's also the individual behind the PowerShell

13:10.760 --> 13:13.920
on Linux website and Twitter account.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.120
And I love his story.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.360
And I wanted to share it with you

13:16.360 --> 13:18.240
and why he thinks PowerShell, which

13:18.240 --> 13:19.680
is a topic that's just like, what?

13:19.680 --> 13:20.180
PowerShell?

13:20.180 --> 13:20.680
Linux?

13:20.680 --> 13:22.560
Bash is perfectly fine.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.880
We talked about it when it came to Linux for the first time.

13:24.880 --> 13:27.120
We knew it was out there, but I mean, I don't use it.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.940
Even today, though, I was in a Telegram group

13:28.940 --> 13:30.440
where he mentioned using PowerShell,

13:30.440 --> 13:32.960
and somebody was like, blasphemy.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.320
But like so many tools, out of necessity,

13:35.320 --> 13:38.080
you discover something's quite useful.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.920
In DM's case, he's a very clever individual,

13:39.920 --> 13:42.180
and he manages a lot of boxes.

13:42.180 --> 13:45.000
I manage over 20,000 VMs.

13:45.000 --> 13:45.960
Yeah.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.040
That's a lot of VMs.

13:47.040 --> 13:50.280
And so saving time is extremely important.

13:50.280 --> 13:53.520
And there's an element to this that I can really

13:53.520 --> 13:54.760
fundamentally appreciate.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.920
But I think maybe we start with PowerShell itself.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.960
PowerShell's a bit of a different beast, isn't it?

13:59.960 --> 14:01.600
It's not like Bash.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.200
No, I mean, it comes from a different heritage, right?

14:04.200 --> 14:05.720
It's not really a Unix tool.

14:05.720 --> 14:06.960
It comes from the Windows world.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.640
And you get to leverage a lot of the.NET platform.

14:09.640 --> 14:13.520
So instead of throwing text around, you've got objects.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.120
Yeah.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.960
For me, I like Bash, and don't get me wrong.

14:16.960 --> 14:21.320
But because it's very text-based,

14:21.320 --> 14:23.960
it's the good thing about it, and it's also

14:23.960 --> 14:25.960
the worst thing about it for me.

14:25.960 --> 14:29.600
Because if you have to work with text,

14:29.600 --> 14:35.760
and you need to figure out all these special commands,

14:35.760 --> 14:38.680
and because PowerShell is, just like Python,

14:38.680 --> 14:44.040
is object-oriented, you can do amazing, simple things.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.160
So easily in one command.

14:46.160 --> 14:47.800
That seems to be the core difference,

14:47.800 --> 14:49.960
object-oriented versus text.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.640
That seems pretty key to using PowerShell.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.080
Well, yeah, right?

14:52.080 --> 14:54.080
I mean, so imagine you've got a date,

14:54.080 --> 14:56.800
and you want to go grab just the month part of that.

14:56.800 --> 14:57.840
Well, you could probably whip up something

14:57.840 --> 14:59.600
to split by whatever separator you're using,

14:59.600 --> 15:01.480
and then grab the middle field or something.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.120
But if you've got objects, well, there's

15:03.120 --> 15:05.280
probably just a method that you call to get the month out

15:05.280 --> 15:05.960
of it, right?

15:05.960 --> 15:08.400
So it's more structured than text.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.520
Now, there's an aspect to it that I can completely

15:10.520 --> 15:13.480
appreciate as well, as somebody who was a desktop Linux

15:13.480 --> 15:17.000
user managing Windows systems, and having

15:17.000 --> 15:19.360
to deal with user account changes and other things

15:19.360 --> 15:20.960
that just desperately, desperately need

15:20.960 --> 15:23.640
to be automated, and trying to come up with a solution

15:23.640 --> 15:27.520
and even some means to automate them across platforms.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.920
Creating an Active Directory user

15:29.920 --> 15:34.840
used to take 30 to 45 minutes because

15:34.840 --> 15:39.520
of all this special stuff, like this all special configuration.

15:39.520 --> 15:43.440
And using PowerShell, I kept saying,

15:43.440 --> 15:45.400
we would hire 30 people, and then they

15:45.400 --> 15:49.120
wouldn't pass their insurance selling exam,

15:49.120 --> 15:50.580
and then we would fire half of them.

15:50.580 --> 15:54.040
And then I would just spend hours creating these accounts

15:54.040 --> 15:57.600
and then deleting them, which was crazy.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.600
So then that's pretty much how I started with PowerShell.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.680
I was like, I'm not going to spend hours.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.160
It's funny.

16:06.160 --> 16:07.440
There has to be a better way.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.080
That is how it always goes, isn't it?

16:09.080 --> 16:10.000
It's a necessity.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.040
Yeah, absolutely.

16:11.040 --> 16:14.320
And it's not all just for managing Microsoft systems.

16:14.320 --> 16:16.280
It's not all just about making sure you can

16:16.280 --> 16:18.080
create Active Directory users.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.320
There's a big community out there.

16:20.320 --> 16:21.720
The other day, I found out there's

16:21.720 --> 16:24.880
a FreeNAS module for PowerShell.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.000
Wow, really?

16:26.000 --> 16:30.720
So now, all of a sudden, I have this FreeNAS box

16:30.720 --> 16:34.120
that I use for my home lab and whatnot.

16:34.120 --> 16:37.200
So all of a sudden, I'm like, I want to create a new volume.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.680
Then I import this.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.080
I download this module.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.360
I import it, and then I have, like,

16:42.360 --> 16:44.400
connect FreeNAS server or something.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.600
I give it the name of the server, the credentials,

16:46.600 --> 16:47.600
and poof, I'm connected.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.160
And then I have other simple commands,

16:50.160 --> 16:53.080
like, I don't know, new volume or whatever,

16:53.080 --> 16:54.080
new FreeNAS volume.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.520
I don't remember the exact command.

16:55.520 --> 16:57.120
Right, but then you can start scripting

16:57.120 --> 16:59.320
your own little environments and handy helpers.

16:59.320 --> 17:00.400
Yeah, exactly.

17:00.400 --> 17:04.880
So then you start at home, and then all of a sudden,

17:04.880 --> 17:06.400
you take it.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.640
And because the API is very similar between FreeNAS

17:09.640 --> 17:12.200
and TrueNAS, you can use the same.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.040
I think the same library supports TrueNAS.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.440
And then you take it to work.

17:15.440 --> 17:21.440
And then at my job, I have to administer

17:21.440 --> 17:25.880
a bunch of different storage systems,

17:25.880 --> 17:28.120
because the application we build integrates

17:28.120 --> 17:31.320
with different SAN providers and stuff like that.

17:31.320 --> 17:35.960
So I have to administer NetApps and Icelon

17:35.960 --> 17:39.600
and all kinds of weird, like FreeNAS is not weird,

17:39.600 --> 17:42.320
but other weird storage vendors.

17:42.320 --> 17:48.320
So if they have PowerShell support, then all of a sudden,

17:48.320 --> 17:50.600
from my Linux box, it's really easy for me

17:50.600 --> 17:54.600
to automate the deployment of all this stuff,

17:54.600 --> 18:00.800
because I have one interface, which is PowerShell,

18:00.800 --> 18:02.960
and I have all these different modules.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.440
One of the things that seems like it's a key differentiator

18:05.440 --> 18:07.560
is PowerShell has these modules.

18:07.560 --> 18:08.080
Yeah, right?

18:08.080 --> 18:10.200
I mean, it's sort of built right in.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.560
In Bash, you might automate things

18:11.560 --> 18:13.160
by installing additional programs,

18:13.160 --> 18:15.120
and then sort of tying those together.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.400
But PowerShell is more like a programming language

18:17.400 --> 18:19.200
in the sense that you've got these community

18:19.200 --> 18:20.600
modules you can go find and use.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.560
So whether it's FreeNAS or I know

18:23.560 --> 18:25.480
DM was talking about Selenium drivers.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.980
So if you want to go do a bunch of automating websites that

18:27.980 --> 18:30.440
don't have APIs, well, you can do that with PowerShell too.

18:30.440 --> 18:31.040
Yeah.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.360
Not everything is golden, though.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.880
Not everything is golden.

18:35.880 --> 18:40.680
For example, a lot of the Active Directory modules

18:40.680 --> 18:42.480
don't work on Linux yet.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.680
I took it upon myself.

18:44.680 --> 18:47.880
I keep talking to different people from Microsoft,

18:47.880 --> 18:50.960
from all kinds of places, like, oh, I have this module.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.040
Can you test it on Linux?

18:52.040 --> 18:53.600
So I download it into my box.

18:53.600 --> 19:00.200
And then I think one of the Azure SQL team

19:00.200 --> 19:05.680
member at Microsoft, they have an official SQL server module.

19:05.680 --> 19:08.200
So he said, hey, it works on core.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.800
It should work on Linux.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.120
I already know that's not true because sometimes there's

19:12.120 --> 19:15.160
all kinds of little things that make you break.

19:15.160 --> 19:16.520
So I downloaded the module.

19:16.520 --> 19:17.360
I tried to import it.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.240
It doesn't work.

19:18.240 --> 19:24.280
It doesn't work because Linux file system is case sensitive

19:24.280 --> 19:25.280
and Windows is not.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.600
So then all of a sudden, this file

19:26.600 --> 19:27.920
has a lowercase letter in it.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.400
Boom, it doesn't break.

19:29.400 --> 19:34.880
So then I created a PR, not a PR, an issue in their system.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.360
And I'm trying to fix it.

19:36.360 --> 19:40.600
DM makes the case that the more users on Linux,

19:40.600 --> 19:43.280
the more priority it becomes for Microsoft.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.720
And what's also great about this,

19:44.720 --> 19:46.880
and this is something I really connected with Amon,

19:46.880 --> 19:50.840
is it means fundamentally more people

19:50.840 --> 19:52.800
can run Linux on the desktop.

19:52.800 --> 19:59.040
I'm trying to make the PowerShell experience on Linux

19:59.040 --> 20:02.560
much better so then more people won't

20:02.560 --> 20:09.080
have to go to Windows to do their day job.

20:09.080 --> 20:12.280
And I think that's probably, if Microsoft

20:12.280 --> 20:14.840
was trying to extinguish Linux, there's

20:14.840 --> 20:17.800
no way they would have open sourced this because it's

20:17.800 --> 20:21.120
pretty much the tool that allows you to manage all these

20:21.120 --> 20:25.120
Microsoft things without Windows.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.000
It is really kind of.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.760
I was thinking like, and we have an extended conversation

20:28.760 --> 20:30.640
with DM that'll be out on Jupiter Extras,

20:30.640 --> 20:31.840
but I was thinking when I was talking to him,

20:31.840 --> 20:33.800
like, I would have killed for this.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.640
Yes, right?

20:34.640 --> 20:36.640
I mean, you can actually go interact with,

20:36.640 --> 20:38.300
leverage a bunch of Windows environments

20:38.300 --> 20:40.240
in a way that's native to them.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.120
I think we're also made a little uncomfortable

20:42.120 --> 20:44.200
because it has this different heritage, right?

20:44.200 --> 20:48.040
Like, it comes from Microsoft, it's using Windows tools,

20:48.040 --> 20:50.840
but it's an open source shell on top

20:50.840 --> 20:52.520
of an open source kernel, right?

20:52.520 --> 20:53.840
Like, what's not to like?

20:53.840 --> 20:55.200
And that cat is out of the bag.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.960
It's MIT licensed, it's out of the bag.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.760
Also of note today, Microsoft open sourced

21:00.760 --> 21:03.080
their C++ standard library.

21:03.080 --> 21:04.320
Actually, it was technically yesterday,

21:04.320 --> 21:06.120
they announced at a community conference

21:06.120 --> 21:09.420
that they were releasing their C++ standard library code

21:09.420 --> 21:11.280
as open source.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.660
The STL code is now up on GitHub

21:13.660 --> 21:15.780
and provided under the Apache 2 license.

21:15.780 --> 21:18.280
Oh yeah, look at them go, more and more open source.

21:18.280 --> 21:19.720
More and more all the time.

21:19.720 --> 21:22.120
They say they hope this move will help developers

21:22.120 --> 21:24.480
continue to keep the library compliant

21:24.480 --> 21:28.280
in the fast-moving world of C++ standards.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.840
And they hope it's a measure of payback

21:29.840 --> 21:30.680
to the developer community.

21:30.680 --> 21:31.680
Isn't that an interesting statement?

21:31.680 --> 21:33.720
The first part's being like,

21:33.720 --> 21:35.520
we're not doing a great job keeping up with the standards,

21:35.520 --> 21:37.520
will you guys help us keep this going?

21:37.520 --> 21:38.960
It's kind of an admission of that, isn't it?

21:38.960 --> 21:40.480
Right, and then the other half is like,

21:40.480 --> 21:43.320
but also, like here, we can all make this better.

21:43.320 --> 21:45.040
You get to have all the code for the other stuff too.

21:45.040 --> 21:45.960
I don't mind that.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.280
No, honestly, it kind of makes sense, right?

21:47.280 --> 21:48.880
That's part of the open source community

21:48.880 --> 21:49.960
and the interactions.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.160
We're all going to use the tooling

21:51.160 --> 21:53.000
and if it is open, we can all make it better.

21:53.000 --> 21:53.840
Yeah.

21:53.840 --> 21:58.480
We have a few items in housekeeping for the episode.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.440
It got messy in here.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.680
Yeah, you know, I've been traveling.

22:02.680 --> 22:05.160
Was it an East Washington over the weekend?

22:05.160 --> 22:06.880
Just didn't have time, brought in a whole bunch of dirt.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.320
I'm sorry about that.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.440
So here's a few things we've got to take care of.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.960
First and foremost, just a reminder,

22:12.960 --> 22:15.720
Texas Cyber Summit coming up real soon now.

22:15.720 --> 22:19.120
Texas Cyber Summit, October 10th through the 12th, 2019

22:19.120 --> 22:20.240
at the Grand Hyatt.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.240
San Antonio.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.280
San Antones.

22:22.280 --> 22:23.320
Wes and I'll be there.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.160
What?

22:24.160 --> 22:25.400
Hey Cheesy, are you going too, Cheesy?

22:25.400 --> 22:26.440
Oh yeah, I'll be there.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.520
Honestly, Cheesy being there, that's a reason to go

22:28.520 --> 22:29.840
if you weren't already thinking about it.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.640
Yeah, that's definitely enough.

22:31.640 --> 22:32.480
Nice.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.320
If you are going to be in the area

22:33.320 --> 22:37.080
and you don't have a ticket, but you would like to go,

22:37.080 --> 22:38.320
join our telegram group.

22:38.320 --> 22:43.040
It's t.me forward slash TCS2019

22:43.040 --> 22:45.240
and you might be able to score a ticket.

22:45.240 --> 22:46.080
What is that again?

22:46.080 --> 22:47.200
T.me slash what?

22:47.200 --> 22:52.200
T.me, T.me slash TCS2019.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.960
TCS, all right, very good.

22:53.960 --> 22:55.400
Texas Cyber Summit.

22:55.400 --> 22:56.440
There's a B new track too,

22:56.440 --> 22:59.240
which if you're thinking about getting in the cyber industry,

22:59.240 --> 23:00.400
that'd be a good one for you.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.240
Right?

23:01.240 --> 23:04.880
Don't forget, we also have the hacker birthday dinner meetup,

23:04.880 --> 23:07.000
meetup.com slash super broadcasting.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
It's all there.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.240
So also, can we just take a moment,

23:11.240 --> 23:14.640
ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause again.

23:14.640 --> 23:17.720
Two new shows launched on the Jupiter Broadcasting Network.

23:17.720 --> 23:20.560
Very, very, very excited to say

23:20.560 --> 23:22.600
we are now into week two of Linux Headlines,

23:22.600 --> 23:24.520
linuxheadlines.show.

23:24.520 --> 23:25.360
Great show.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.200
Oh man.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.240
West, you're doing a bang up job.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.080
No, you're doing a bang up job.

23:28.080 --> 23:28.920
Drew killed it.

23:28.920 --> 23:29.760
No, you are.

23:29.760 --> 23:30.600
Drew killed it on Friday.

23:30.600 --> 23:31.440
Drew killed it.

23:31.440 --> 23:33.240
Fridays with Drew are my favorite.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.320
He's so damn good.

23:35.320 --> 23:36.800
How can he be so new and still that good?

23:36.800 --> 23:37.640
I don't know.

23:37.640 --> 23:38.460
We'll learn from him though.

23:38.460 --> 23:39.300
I know.

23:39.300 --> 23:41.160
So linuxheadlines.show, go check that out.

23:41.160 --> 23:42.560
The things you need to know that's going on

23:42.560 --> 23:44.920
on Linux and open source in three minutes or less

23:44.920 --> 23:46.520
every weekday.

23:46.520 --> 23:47.600
Yeah, I said every weekday.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.440
I said that.

23:48.440 --> 23:49.260
I said that.

23:49.260 --> 23:50.100
It's crazy.

23:50.100 --> 23:51.120
linuxheadlines.show.

23:51.120 --> 23:54.440
Also, it's finally here.

23:54.440 --> 23:56.240
Self-hosted episode one.

23:56.240 --> 24:00.320
The first one is out, self-hosted.show slash one.

24:00.320 --> 24:04.240
Alex and I just get things kicked off in this episode.

24:04.240 --> 24:07.280
And then coming up very soon, self-hosted.show,

24:07.280 --> 24:08.400
our episode with Wendell.

24:08.400 --> 24:09.560
Oh boy.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.160
Great chat with Wendell.

24:11.160 --> 24:12.120
It's all ready to go.

24:12.120 --> 24:13.280
We'll be launching it soon.

24:13.280 --> 24:16.240
Every fortnight over at self-hosted.show.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.880
So go get episode one now

24:17.880 --> 24:19.320
and stick around for episode two with Wendell.

24:19.320 --> 24:22.880
Got a great chat, toured his studio, his servers,

24:22.880 --> 24:25.600
his workstations, chat all about it.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.440
It's pretty great.

24:26.440 --> 24:27.280
So go check that out.

24:27.280 --> 24:30.520
Self-hosted.show and linuxheadlines.show.

24:30.520 --> 24:32.640
Man, so much going on.

24:32.640 --> 24:33.480
Crazy.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.360
And before you know it, it's Texas Cyber Summit.

24:35.360 --> 24:36.920
Before you even know it, Wes.

24:36.920 --> 24:37.760
All right.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.280
That's the housekeeping.

24:40.280 --> 24:41.120
That's the housekeeping.

24:41.120 --> 24:41.960
Nicely done.

24:41.960 --> 24:44.000
No, you did great.

24:45.880 --> 24:47.960
I don't know, I think we've just come up with a thing.

24:47.960 --> 24:51.200
So you and I had a chance last week to talk to Phil,

24:51.200 --> 24:52.920
one of the co-founders of Mangero,

24:52.920 --> 24:55.520
after they announced the new formation of their company.

24:55.520 --> 24:56.720
Which was great.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.680
Really exciting for them.

24:58.680 --> 25:02.360
And we then thought, well, let's have

25:02.360 --> 25:04.080
kind of like a Mangero celebration.

25:04.080 --> 25:04.920
Stubble down.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.960
And let's talk with Bernard,

25:06.960 --> 25:08.680
one of the other co-founders this week,

25:08.680 --> 25:10.880
because you and I had checked out the community additions,

25:10.880 --> 25:13.780
which is one of the many things that Bernard's involved in,

25:13.780 --> 25:14.920
as well as a few other things.

25:14.920 --> 25:18.200
And just to really kind of recognize the moment

25:18.200 --> 25:19.040
for Mangero.

25:19.040 --> 25:21.720
They've moved into a new echelon of distributions.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.920
There's a legal entity behind them.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.120
They have a community.

25:25.120 --> 25:28.720
They've formed partnerships with commercial organizations.

25:28.720 --> 25:31.400
They're getting recognition on large YouTube platforms.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.200
It's a big moment.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.040
And so we really wanted to take the time

25:35.040 --> 25:37.120
to both talk to Phil and Bernard.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.720
Hello, thanks for having me.

25:38.720 --> 25:39.560
Hello, sir.

25:39.560 --> 25:42.960
So why don't we start off with a little bit of news.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.560
There's a brand new, fresh release of Mangero

25:45.560 --> 25:47.600
that's out just as we record.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.560
What's your favorite thing about the new release?

25:49.560 --> 25:51.440
Oh, it was quite busy for all of us

25:51.440 --> 25:56.440
because we had to get a lot of different additions going.

25:56.800 --> 26:01.800
Of course, the official ones, KD Plasma, XFC, and GNOME.

26:02.200 --> 26:06.440
And I'm also in charge of some of the community additions.

26:06.440 --> 26:10.240
So I was doing i3 and Cinnamon,

26:10.240 --> 26:11.700
and they're all rolling now.

26:11.700 --> 26:16.700
So yes, we have the 18.1.0 release.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.320
Of course, it's just a snapshot,

26:19.320 --> 26:21.520
not a real, I mean, it's not a real thing

26:21.520 --> 26:22.440
with a rolling release.

26:22.440 --> 26:26.240
But of course, we polish everything with the install media.

26:26.240 --> 26:29.480
And so the installer works and stuff

26:29.480 --> 26:32.480
with some new additions, of course,

26:32.480 --> 26:36.920
with the new Flatpak and Snaps support

26:36.920 --> 26:40.480
with Bau, our new tool.

26:40.480 --> 26:44.880
And also Calamares had a recent update,

26:44.880 --> 26:49.120
and we also offered a new Office Suite chooser.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.080
So I want to talk about the community addition stuff

26:51.080 --> 26:51.920
here in a moment,

26:51.920 --> 26:54.660
but we got to do like the human stuff upfront.

26:55.700 --> 26:57.200
So you got a new job.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.320
Yeah, I do.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.320
I mean, it's basically the job I've been doing

27:00.320 --> 27:03.440
for five years already, but now it's a job.

27:03.440 --> 27:07.720
It just used to be like kind of an oversized hobby for me.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.440
I was doing other stuff.

27:10.440 --> 27:13.080
I was in the music business as a singer,

27:14.520 --> 27:16.440
but my hobby was taking a lot of time.

27:16.440 --> 27:19.800
And so this is finally what I can now concentrate on.

27:19.800 --> 27:20.900
Congratulations.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.600
You mentioned it as an aside there,

27:23.600 --> 27:28.200
but you're a bit of a known musician.

27:28.200 --> 27:29.880
We did a little Googling, Bernard.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.520
You have a bit of an online presence when it comes to music.

27:32.520 --> 27:33.960
Show research, you know.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.040
Oh yeah, that's true.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.360
Yes, I've been quite active.

27:37.360 --> 27:40.120
How did you end up being also pretty prominent

27:40.120 --> 27:42.160
here in the open source community?

27:42.160 --> 27:47.160
Oh, well, I always liked tweaking and analyzing stuff

27:47.720 --> 27:50.400
and breaking stuff and putting it again together.

27:50.400 --> 27:55.400
I actually started out with Atari when it was still a thing.

27:55.440 --> 28:00.440
And so I found myself quite at home with Linux.

28:01.760 --> 28:05.080
In between, I was of course using Windows

28:05.080 --> 28:06.960
for everything I needed.

28:06.960 --> 28:11.680
And then my main stoppers to switch over to Linux

28:11.680 --> 28:16.680
were especially the music software, like music editing.

28:18.080 --> 28:21.920
I mean, printed music editing and this kind of stuff.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.920
But during the recent years,

28:25.920 --> 28:29.440
we now have really software for everything I need.

28:29.440 --> 28:33.680
So that was finally my opportunity to switch over to Linux.

28:33.680 --> 28:36.480
So you come from a creative angle on all of this.

28:36.480 --> 28:37.960
Yeah, you could say that.

28:37.960 --> 28:41.080
It seems that that has also manifested

28:41.080 --> 28:44.680
in you're one of the probably, I guess,

28:44.680 --> 28:46.560
you're probably one of the prominent supporters

28:46.560 --> 28:49.080
of the different community editions.

28:49.080 --> 28:51.560
You know, I had an opportunity to chat with you off air

28:51.560 --> 28:53.240
about the i3 and Cinnamon editions,

28:53.240 --> 28:55.720
which I think you're the direct maintainer of.

28:55.720 --> 28:57.160
So let's talk a little bit about that.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.400
Is that a creative expression for you as well?

28:59.400 --> 29:00.240
Yeah, it is.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.800
I mean, I've styled the desktops.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.560
I mean, i3 is a good example

29:04.560 --> 29:09.360
because the way it comes from just the packages,

29:09.360 --> 29:13.920
it's just totally naked and ugly and difficult to use.

29:13.920 --> 29:17.840
And so it took quite a lot of creativity also

29:17.840 --> 29:21.560
and tweaking and also about the optics

29:21.560 --> 29:25.760
and theming is also a topic

29:25.760 --> 29:28.160
in all of our editions, of course.

29:28.160 --> 29:31.520
And so I took over Cinnamon

29:31.520 --> 29:36.000
and i3 was kind of abandoned a few years ago.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.280
And so that was really a good opportunity for me to,

29:39.280 --> 29:44.280
yeah, also express my kind of my taste

29:44.960 --> 29:48.320
and I like things to look nice

29:48.320 --> 29:52.160
and to be also accessible

29:52.160 --> 29:54.960
and also pretty on the surface.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.440
Can you maybe go into a little more

29:56.440 --> 29:58.520
about what's different about community editions?

29:58.520 --> 30:00.080
I mean, you know, you're involved

30:00.080 --> 30:01.520
and you're part of the core project.

30:01.520 --> 30:04.640
So how is that different from one of your major releases?

30:04.640 --> 30:09.400
Basically, traditionally in the Manjaro community,

30:09.400 --> 30:11.000
it was like we had,

30:12.320 --> 30:14.600
it used to be open box originally

30:14.600 --> 30:19.600
where the core team like was maintaining a main edition

30:20.720 --> 30:25.720
and then we had XFC and KDE came after that.

30:25.720 --> 30:29.760
And then GNOME is more recent edition.

30:29.760 --> 30:33.680
And the community editions were mostly just done

30:33.680 --> 30:35.280
by one person.

30:35.280 --> 30:39.080
So if you found a desktop environment that you would like

30:39.080 --> 30:42.280
and then you would like offer it on the forum.

30:42.280 --> 30:46.520
And if you were the first one who presented

30:46.520 --> 30:50.800
then a desktop edition, then it was just your edition.

30:50.800 --> 30:55.120
And yeah, it has also grown, I would say.

30:55.120 --> 31:00.120
And nowadays it's like also the community editions

31:00.240 --> 31:03.240
are maintained by members of the core team.

31:03.240 --> 31:04.160
Oh, that's fascinating.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.000
Yeah.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.880
I look at the Cinnamon edition

31:06.880 --> 31:08.320
and the i3 edition specifically

31:08.320 --> 31:11.000
and I think they seem like passion projects to me.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
But I do kind of wanna,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.440
I wanna kind of examine that question

31:14.440 --> 31:16.800
that Wes had there just a little bit further.

31:17.560 --> 31:21.120
So I kind of, when I picture the Manjaro project,

31:21.120 --> 31:25.960
I picture a default XFCE desktop.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.400
But we were just chatting recently

31:27.400 --> 31:31.320
and it seems depending on the time of month or day,

31:31.320 --> 31:33.160
there's other additions like the plasma edition

31:33.160 --> 31:35.120
that may actually be more popular.

31:35.120 --> 31:38.680
Manjaro isn't necessarily defined by a single desktop.

31:38.680 --> 31:42.280
So I guess, Bernard, in your opinion,

31:42.280 --> 31:45.720
what defines Manjaro, especially for people

31:45.720 --> 31:47.320
that are listening that maybe don't use it,

31:47.320 --> 31:50.240
what defines it apart from Arch?

31:50.240 --> 31:54.320
One important point is the usability, right?

31:54.320 --> 31:59.240
I mean, i3 is a good example because as I already said,

31:59.240 --> 32:04.000
it's very hard to use as it comes originally.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.840
And so I've really tried to make it more accessible

32:07.840 --> 32:12.840
to make it look pretty and run right out of the box

32:15.120 --> 32:18.880
with everything available, all the shortcuts organized

32:18.880 --> 32:21.360
and with a little introduction.

32:21.360 --> 32:26.360
And I mean, Manjaro is mostly about the core system.

32:27.280 --> 32:31.640
And as you can see, it's a huge variety

32:31.640 --> 32:34.640
of just different desktops on top.

32:34.640 --> 32:37.720
So the team, everybody together makes sure

32:37.720 --> 32:40.680
that the core system runs well

32:40.680 --> 32:44.120
and that the system is reliable.

32:44.120 --> 32:48.000
And then it's just a question of putting any desktop

32:48.000 --> 32:49.960
on top, basically.

32:49.960 --> 32:53.360
And over the years, we have like also developed

32:53.360 --> 32:55.640
our typical style.

32:55.640 --> 32:59.160
It was also, we decided that it would be good

32:59.160 --> 33:02.680
that when you open up a desktop on the first site,

33:02.680 --> 33:06.760
you would be able to see, oh yes, this is a Manjaro edition.

33:06.760 --> 33:11.000
So it's like the colors, it's the fonts.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
So there is some branding element.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.760
Yeah, you could say that.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.200
It's not actually the same themes.

33:17.200 --> 33:21.360
Yeah, because they don't necessarily work on every desktop,

33:21.360 --> 33:24.840
but then we try to find kind of matching colors

33:24.840 --> 33:27.560
and common wallpapers and that kind of stuff.

33:28.560 --> 33:30.720
So do you feel like it would be a fair assessment

33:30.720 --> 33:35.240
to say the difference from Arch is the brand,

33:35.240 --> 33:37.720
the community, and the intention

33:37.720 --> 33:39.720
that you put into the desktop?

33:39.720 --> 33:44.720
And you can apply that to i3, Cinnamon, XFCE, or Plasma,

33:44.720 --> 33:48.520
because what defines Manjaro isn't a desktop environment.

33:48.520 --> 33:52.680
The mentality of presenting a desktop ready to go,

33:52.680 --> 33:53.760
I would say.

33:53.760 --> 33:57.120
I mean, Arch people are really keen on building everything

33:57.120 --> 34:01.040
and styling everything the way everybody likes personally.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.720
And we offer like one version that you could just start

34:04.720 --> 34:06.960
using on an everyday basis.

34:06.960 --> 34:10.400
And if you can live with how it looks like,

34:10.400 --> 34:13.280
then you can just, you would never have to change anything.

34:13.280 --> 34:17.440
And also, we put together a combination of packages,

34:17.440 --> 34:24.440
like you have an image viewer, you have a music player,

34:24.440 --> 34:27.920
you have an office suite, you have a mail program, a browser,

34:27.920 --> 34:31.240
so that you have everything that you would normally need.

34:31.240 --> 34:33.840
So my question is, now that things are changing a little bit,

34:33.840 --> 34:38.160
it's becoming a real business, it's a full-time gig for you,

34:38.160 --> 34:41.240
will there be some shifts in your priorities?

34:41.240 --> 34:45.120
You've got a lot on your plate right now, especially with the community edition stuff.

34:45.120 --> 34:48.520
Do you see a future where you kind of narrow the list a little bit

34:48.520 --> 34:49.720
of what you're involved with?

34:49.720 --> 34:50.720
I don't know.

34:50.720 --> 34:54.480
I mean, at the moment, we are just starting out

34:54.480 --> 34:58.640
and looking around a little bit where our direction is really going.

34:58.640 --> 35:04.480
We are collecting ideas and I have the feeling

35:04.480 --> 35:07.840
that the team is extremely motivated by our steps.

35:07.840 --> 35:13.320
And we have a lot of discussions between not just the two of us, of course,

35:13.320 --> 35:19.440
between the whole team, which is about something around 12 people or so.

35:19.440 --> 35:25.520
And at the moment, it's also about finding out who likes to specialize in what

35:25.520 --> 35:28.240
and where the strengths of everybody lie.

35:28.240 --> 35:35.120
And I don't really think that we need to narrow down our offer at the moment.

35:35.120 --> 35:38.120
It's not really what it's about.

35:38.120 --> 35:42.120
I mean, the basic idea is to keep what we have running

35:42.120 --> 35:46.120
and then to add what comes up.

35:46.120 --> 35:52.120
It sort of strikes me that Manjaro is sort of the first to make it this far

35:52.120 --> 35:54.120
with something that's based on Arch.

35:54.120 --> 35:57.120
You could look at Arch much like Ubuntu looks at Debian

35:57.120 --> 36:00.120
as a great base to build a product on top of.

36:00.120 --> 36:05.120
And you're sort of first to this real estate. You're the first to this new land.

36:05.120 --> 36:07.120
What happens next?

36:07.120 --> 36:14.120
I mean, Arch has this reputation of being hard to build, hard to use, and hard to maintain.

36:14.120 --> 36:18.120
And so that's somehow where we have grown into.

36:18.120 --> 36:26.120
We have built our way of balancing the bleeding edge idea

36:26.120 --> 36:30.120
with usability and continuity.

36:30.120 --> 36:34.120
Of course, it's still a little bit of a balancing act,

36:34.120 --> 36:38.120
but I think we have found our ground here very well now.

36:38.120 --> 36:43.120
So that's probably why we are now in a position where we can really say,

36:43.120 --> 36:49.120
okay, this is quite reliable and we can look back on several years now

36:49.120 --> 36:52.120
where this has been running smoothly.

36:52.120 --> 37:03.120
And one idea of incorporating was also that, as you can see with other projects,

37:03.120 --> 37:08.120
that at a certain point it really gets very hard to do this

37:08.120 --> 37:11.120
beside everything else you do.

37:11.120 --> 37:17.120
As a hobby, it's just you really need to invest a lot of time, a lot of energy,

37:17.120 --> 37:22.120
and to keep it with a certain amount of quality.

37:22.120 --> 37:28.120
That's basically our motivation to find a way to really be able to focus on this.

37:28.120 --> 37:33.120
I'm pretty excited about it because I think at some point I had just accepted the idea

37:33.120 --> 37:38.120
that all of the next big distros that were ever going to happen had happened,

37:38.120 --> 37:43.120
and now it was just a matter of, well, let's settle in and figure out how to make this work.

37:43.120 --> 37:50.120
And then Manjaro comes along and proved me wrong, and I think it's just so fantastic.

37:50.120 --> 37:56.120
I think we have absolutely room for more, and you guys are really committed to the project,

37:56.120 --> 38:00.120
and it's getting recognized for what it's contributing and those paper cuts

38:00.120 --> 38:05.120
that it's solving for end users, and it's just such a great thing to see this next step being taken.

38:05.120 --> 38:07.120
And Bernard, I love the Community Editions.

38:07.120 --> 38:10.120
I had a chance to play with Cinnamon and i3 over the weekend.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.120
We'll have links in the show notes for those.

38:12.120 --> 38:18.120
And I just love that that's even a thing, and that we can have a company where this kind of thing can go on,

38:18.120 --> 38:21.120
and it can be a creative expression for you and all of that.

38:21.120 --> 38:23.120
So thanks for coming on and just answering some of these questions.

38:23.120 --> 38:26.120
It's just something I've been considering, and I don't know, man.

38:26.120 --> 38:27.120
I'm just super happy for you guys.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.120
Thanks for that.

38:28.120 --> 38:31.120
Jeezy, you've been running Manjaro for a little while, haven't you?

38:31.120 --> 38:39.120
Yeah, so I've got this Dell Inspiron 3000 Series 2-in-1.

38:39.120 --> 38:45.120
It was my wife's old computer, and so it just got handed down to me.

38:45.120 --> 38:48.120
The first thing I was going to do is load Linux on it.

38:48.120 --> 38:52.120
Whenever I tried to load any distro on it, I would have a problem.

38:52.120 --> 38:57.120
Because it's a 2-in-1, it has an accelerometer and a gyroscope in it.

38:57.120 --> 39:07.120
So by default, and this was elementary, pop, fedora, I mean, any distribution that I tried,

39:07.120 --> 39:10.120
those kernel modules would be enabled by default.

39:10.120 --> 39:20.120
So my login screen would be flipped 180 degrees and then inverted,

39:20.120 --> 39:26.120
as if it was in tablet mode and you would be entering information in tablet mode,

39:26.120 --> 39:29.120
which, you know, is nothing that you can't with GNOME.

39:29.120 --> 39:33.120
You can lock screen rotation now, and you can do other things that make it a little bit easier.

39:33.120 --> 39:38.120
You can X, R, and R, you know, and set it back to normal.

39:38.120 --> 39:41.120
You can go back in and blacklist those kernel modules.

39:41.120 --> 39:47.120
But the one distro that has worked every single time out of the box,

39:47.120 --> 39:51.120
doesn't matter which DEF tried, has been Manjaro.

39:51.120 --> 39:54.120
I've never had those kernel modules loaded by default.

39:54.120 --> 39:58.120
And for me, I mean, that's a pretty significant thing.

39:58.120 --> 40:05.120
You know, that takes three steps out of just getting the machine working properly.

40:05.120 --> 40:08.120
And, you know, so I've been using Manjaro off and on on that machine,

40:08.120 --> 40:13.120
just I use it to test other distros, knowing that I'm going to have to rotate the screen,

40:13.120 --> 40:18.120
I'm going to have to do a few tweaks, but then inevitably always go back to Xfce,

40:18.120 --> 40:21.120
the Xfce variant of Manjaro on it.

40:21.120 --> 40:24.120
And man, I really like it. It's been solid.

40:24.120 --> 40:29.120
Like Bernard said, I love the fact that I still get that rolling release,

40:29.120 --> 40:32.120
but I don't have to spend the time to set up Arch.

40:32.120 --> 40:34.120
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

40:34.120 --> 40:37.120
I mean, if I've been down that road, I've done that as well, right?

40:37.120 --> 40:42.120
But to have a distro out of the box, bleeding edge, boom, here you go.

40:42.120 --> 40:45.120
Yeah, it helps that they make such nice, you know, choices.

40:45.120 --> 40:48.120
Like the defaults are good, so you don't have to change that much.

40:48.120 --> 40:50.120
Yeah, it's tastefully done. Absolutely.

40:50.120 --> 40:54.120
The fact that they've gone through and they've tried to mimic, you know,

40:54.120 --> 40:57.120
those themes across all of the DEs and everything.

40:57.120 --> 40:59.120
I think they've really done a great job.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.120
I haven't tried all of the community additions.

41:01.120 --> 41:07.120
I will now though, knowing that I didn't realize that Bernard was putting those together as well.

41:07.120 --> 41:11.120
So I guess they're official community additions.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.120
Ish, yeah.

41:12.120 --> 41:15.120
I really love Manjaro too.

41:15.120 --> 41:18.120
I'm a diehard Arch Linux user on the desktop,

41:18.120 --> 41:21.120
and my laptop is running Manjaro.

41:21.120 --> 41:29.120
And the implementation of XFCE that they have is the one that made me realize that XFCE is pretty great.

41:29.120 --> 41:34.120
You know, I'm getting 10 to 12 hours worth of battery life on a T480.

41:34.120 --> 41:36.120
The laptop's cool to the touch.

41:36.120 --> 41:39.120
You know, it just works like Chi said.

41:39.120 --> 41:44.120
And it's more than Arch for people that can't be bothered to install Arch, I think,

41:44.120 --> 41:47.120
which is what it was always sold as.

41:47.120 --> 41:50.120
I look at it a lot, although I'm going to try not to make this comparison.

41:50.120 --> 41:54.120
But I look at it in some ways similar to Ubuntu to Debian.

41:54.120 --> 41:59.120
Like I could get a decent Debian desktop going if I wanted to spend some time

41:59.120 --> 42:03.120
changing all of the defaults and optimizing things a bit.

42:03.120 --> 42:07.120
I could, you know, it's not much more work really than setting up Arch.

42:07.120 --> 42:10.120
I mean, it is probably a little less, but it's kind of equivalent.

42:10.120 --> 42:14.120
Or you could install Ubuntu and you have a pretty ready-to-go machine.

42:14.120 --> 42:16.120
Like that's very much how Ubuntu started.

42:16.120 --> 42:21.120
It was a refined selection of good desktop packages with some same defaults

42:21.120 --> 42:24.120
synced to the GNOME release schedule.

42:24.120 --> 42:28.120
And so it was a great way to get easy-to-use Debian.

42:28.120 --> 42:30.120
That's what made it so successful initially.

42:30.120 --> 42:35.120
And that fundamental recipe is kind of what they're applying here to Arch.

42:35.120 --> 42:38.120
Well, one thing that I really like too is as an official version,

42:38.120 --> 42:40.120
they have the Architect Edition.

42:40.120 --> 42:43.120
So if you want to do the same thing you would do with Arch,

42:43.120 --> 42:46.120
you can still do that with the Manjaro ISO,

42:46.120 --> 42:50.120
which I think is cool that they offer that as an official version as well.

42:50.120 --> 42:51.120
Well, congrats to them.

42:51.120 --> 42:55.120
Very happy to see them turn this into something they can do sustainably.

42:55.120 --> 42:56.120
What am I trying to say?

42:56.120 --> 42:57.120
Sustainably, yeah, right.

42:57.120 --> 42:59.120
I mean, it's a big deal.

42:59.120 --> 43:01.120
Bernard had a successful singing career,

43:01.120 --> 43:05.120
and now he's focusing on this Linux distribution full-time,

43:05.120 --> 43:08.120
and it's cool that that actually exists.

43:08.120 --> 43:10.120
So we have an app pick we want to get to,

43:10.120 --> 43:13.120
and we have a headline that we pulled out of Linux headlines

43:13.120 --> 43:15.120
to discuss a little bit more here in the show.

43:15.120 --> 43:16.120
So let's do that one first.

43:16.120 --> 43:20.120
Just one last thing here from the community news is we've got new kernels, Wes.

43:20.120 --> 43:24.120
We've got one that's out now, kernel 5.3 came out this weekend.

43:24.120 --> 43:25.120
And that's always fun.

43:25.120 --> 43:28.120
I also kind of want to talk a little bit about 5.4.

43:28.120 --> 43:32.120
But in 5.3, they added the ACRN hypervisor,

43:32.120 --> 43:34.120
which I was hoping was pronounced acorn.

43:34.120 --> 43:35.120
Acorn.

43:35.120 --> 43:36.120
But I don't think it is.

43:36.120 --> 43:38.120
Why would you not pronounce it acorn?

43:38.120 --> 43:39.120
Why do we need another hypervisor?

43:39.120 --> 43:40.120
What's so unique here?

43:40.120 --> 43:44.120
Well, okay, so this is actually guest support for Linux.

43:44.120 --> 43:48.120
So acorn is a hypervisor that's targeted at embedded and IoT applications,

43:48.120 --> 43:50.120
but things like real-time and safety.

43:50.120 --> 43:53.120
So if you've got things in your car or maybe in like factory-managed equipment

43:53.120 --> 43:55.120
that, you know, people's lives are at stake.

43:55.120 --> 43:58.120
Where it could be an embedded device and it uses virtualization

43:58.120 --> 44:00.120
to run different OSs on it.

44:00.120 --> 44:02.120
Yes, workload consolidation, right?

44:02.120 --> 44:03.120
You can move lots of things.

44:03.120 --> 44:06.120
Existing hypervisors, things that you might use in a data center,

44:06.120 --> 44:08.120
not really set up or designed with those goals.

44:08.120 --> 44:12.120
So this is supposed to be an open-source implementation of a reference stack,

44:12.120 --> 44:15.120
basically, all managed by the Linux Foundation.

44:15.120 --> 44:19.120
Of course, this patch set allows Linux to be booted on top of acorn.

44:19.120 --> 44:20.120
So, hey, that's great.

44:20.120 --> 44:22.120
That means more places that Linux will run.

44:22.120 --> 44:24.120
I mean, if you're going to run an OS on your IoT device,

44:24.120 --> 44:26.120
I'd rather it be Linux.

44:26.120 --> 44:28.120
And I'd rather it be updatable and supported.

44:28.120 --> 44:31.120
And if it's baked into the kernel, that means it actually might be possible.

44:31.120 --> 44:33.120
Now, this is only bare-bones support, so we'll see what happens.

44:33.120 --> 44:37.120
There's another patch in 5.3 that I thought didn't get enough attention.

44:37.120 --> 44:42.120
You know, I don't know about you, Chris, but sometimes you have a high DPI screen,

44:42.120 --> 44:44.120
and then you go and you, like, boot.

44:44.120 --> 44:46.120
You boot Linux, and you can't read it, right?

44:46.120 --> 44:49.120
You can't read anything, especially what happens if it doesn't boot up all the way?

44:49.120 --> 44:50.120
Right.

44:50.120 --> 44:51.120
There's a fix for that now.

44:51.120 --> 44:52.120
Yeah.

44:52.120 --> 44:54.120
Prefer a bigger font for high-resolution screens.

44:54.120 --> 44:55.120
That's the name of the commit.

44:55.120 --> 44:57.120
And, I mean, like, why would you not want that?

44:57.120 --> 45:00.120
Everything you need to know is in the name of the commit.

45:00.120 --> 45:05.120
So it will prefer a console font that is larger on high DPI display

45:05.120 --> 45:06.120
so you can actually read it.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.120
Yeah.

45:07.120 --> 45:11.120
Now, for, like, 1920 by 1080 and below, nothing changes, no effect.

45:11.120 --> 45:13.120
But if you're above that, there's a different font that's used.

45:13.120 --> 45:18.120
So it seems like this should have happened ages ago, but as a terminal user, I'm glad.

45:18.120 --> 45:20.120
I actually didn't supermind it.

45:20.120 --> 45:23.120
Sometimes we get a little janky on how it would update on the screen,

45:23.120 --> 45:27.120
but I kind of like fitting more stuff on the screen, you know?

45:27.120 --> 45:29.120
I want more screens, and I want to fit more on them.

45:29.120 --> 45:31.120
Yeah, but I don't always have my microscope right next to my display.

45:31.120 --> 45:32.120
That's true.

45:32.120 --> 45:34.120
Yeah, on the XPS 13, it was kind of ridiculous.

45:34.120 --> 45:37.120
It was getting pretty bad, actually.

45:37.120 --> 45:40.120
Well, so it's not out yet, but I kind of wanted to talk about something

45:40.120 --> 45:45.120
that I thought was interesting about the 5.4 impending release.

45:45.120 --> 45:48.120
So this next one has a bunch of neat stuff.

45:48.120 --> 45:52.120
But what I think we're now seeing is, you recall just a few weeks ago

45:52.120 --> 45:56.120
when the news came out that Microsoft was changing their positioning

45:56.120 --> 45:59.120
on exFAT licensing and said, all right, have at it.

45:59.120 --> 46:01.120
You can whip up some exFAT code.

46:01.120 --> 46:02.120
You can submit to the kernel.

46:02.120 --> 46:05.120
We will not pursue any patent infringement litigation.

46:05.120 --> 46:08.120
Great. Hoorah.

46:08.120 --> 46:12.120
And then there was this sort of side story about, oh, it turns out somebody

46:12.120 --> 46:14.120
created some exFAT code.

46:14.120 --> 46:17.120
It's not of great quality, but it will probably make it in the kernel pretty soon.

46:17.120 --> 46:19.120
Who could that be?

46:19.120 --> 46:24.120
Well, now we got a name on a commit, and that name ties back to Samsung.

46:24.120 --> 46:25.120
Samsung.

46:25.120 --> 46:28.120
So Samsung whipped this up for their Android devices, likely.

46:28.120 --> 46:29.120
Of course.

46:29.120 --> 46:32.120
Of substandard quality, which... You know, you just hack it together.

46:32.120 --> 46:33.120
It's fine. Who cares?

46:33.120 --> 46:35.120
They're just putting it on a cell phone that's going to millions of pockets.

46:35.120 --> 46:36.120
It only costs $800.

46:36.120 --> 46:38.120
Who cares, right?

46:38.120 --> 46:43.120
And so that should be landing in its early quality status

46:43.120 --> 46:46.120
in the 5.4 kernel, exFAT like that.

46:46.120 --> 46:48.120
I'd love to see that land in Fedora 31.

46:48.120 --> 46:52.120
Now, has there been time for quality improvements, or is this still...

46:52.120 --> 46:53.120
No, no, no.

46:53.120 --> 46:54.120
I mean, maybe.

46:54.120 --> 46:55.120
You know, maybe.

46:55.120 --> 46:58.120
I mean, honestly, if I were them, as soon as Microsoft made that announcement,

46:58.120 --> 47:00.120
I would have been like, all right, get that guy back over here.

47:00.120 --> 47:01.120
Get him working on it.

47:01.120 --> 47:02.120
That's what I would have done.

47:02.120 --> 47:03.120
I don't know.

47:03.120 --> 47:04.120
But you're right.

47:04.120 --> 47:07.120
I mean, it's nice to see, and now we can all use it finally.

47:07.120 --> 47:08.120
It's out there.

47:08.120 --> 47:09.120
Not that I needed it done.

47:09.120 --> 47:11.120
I just had that experience.

47:11.120 --> 47:14.120
So what happened was, is during our team sprint in the summer,

47:14.120 --> 47:16.120
we had a bunch of great pictures, and I'm like,

47:16.120 --> 47:19.120
well, let me pop in the old SD card here that's built into my ThinkPad.

47:19.120 --> 47:20.120
Right, it's great.

47:20.120 --> 47:21.120
Take advantage of that.

47:21.120 --> 47:22.120
Because hashtag port options.

47:22.120 --> 47:25.120
And I pop it in there, and I look like a fool

47:25.120 --> 47:29.120
because my operating system, which was Fedora 30, could do nothing with it.

47:29.120 --> 47:30.120
Nothing.

47:30.120 --> 47:34.120
And I had the realization that, oh, yeah, I got to go install Fuse,

47:34.120 --> 47:36.120
and I got this whole song and dance.

47:36.120 --> 47:39.120
It sounds silly, but it's almost like being pulled back to old Linux.

47:39.120 --> 47:41.120
You know, like these days, things just mostly just work.

47:41.120 --> 47:42.120
Well, yeah.

47:42.120 --> 47:46.120
And this is suddenly like, oh, right, Linux is like this sometimes.

47:46.120 --> 47:49.120
Yeah, and so it would be kind of a remarkable thing

47:49.120 --> 47:54.120
if in the next release, if in 31, it just worked.

47:54.120 --> 47:58.120
Even if it was just read-only, I'd be fine with that.

47:58.120 --> 47:59.120
Don't get me right.

47:59.120 --> 48:02.120
Just let me import my damn pictures, please.

48:02.120 --> 48:04.120
I want to stash them in my file system like a squirrel.

48:04.120 --> 48:05.120
It is cool.

48:05.120 --> 48:06.120
I mean, right, open source.

48:06.120 --> 48:09.120
And now you know that if improvements are needed,

48:09.120 --> 48:13.120
we've got the kernel infrastructure and development staff in place.

48:13.120 --> 48:18.120
Well, I think this only helps the creatives that use Linux from day to day,

48:18.120 --> 48:23.120
like Brent, you know, constantly pulling images from large SD cards

48:23.120 --> 48:27.120
or creating video content, drone video.

48:27.120 --> 48:29.120
I mean, anything like that.

48:29.120 --> 48:31.120
I think this is a win for us for sure.

48:31.120 --> 48:33.120
So tell us about ClipGrab.

48:33.120 --> 48:37.120
Jeezy brings us an app pick this week that could be useful for those of you

48:37.120 --> 48:39.120
that like offline media like I do.

48:39.120 --> 48:45.120
Oh, so, yeah, I was digging around actually in the Manjaro repos last night,

48:45.120 --> 48:51.120
and I came across ClipGrab, which is essentially a GUI version,

48:51.120 --> 48:54.120
not necessarily a version of YouTube DL.

48:54.120 --> 48:58.120
It's its own thing, but it's super nice.

48:58.120 --> 49:04.120
I use it to pull down tutorial videos for different Adobe products and stuff like that

49:04.120 --> 49:08.120
so that I can offline those and watch them separately on another device

49:08.120 --> 49:10.120
while I'm actually going through them.

49:10.120 --> 49:11.120
I love it, man.

49:11.120 --> 49:12.120
ClipGrab, check it out.

49:12.120 --> 49:17.120
It's worth the download, and it's super easy to use, dead simple to use.

49:17.120 --> 49:23.120
You can pull down MP4, MP3, OGS, all different various formats.

49:23.120 --> 49:24.120
Oh, this is just an app image.

49:24.120 --> 49:25.120
Hey, Andy.

49:25.120 --> 49:28.120
Yeah, it's an app image, and you can just download and run it, and yeah,

49:28.120 --> 49:32.120
it can convert videos to MP3s if you want to like pop it on a podcast

49:32.120 --> 49:34.120
while you're driving and you don't need the visuals.

49:34.120 --> 49:35.120
That's pretty great.

49:35.120 --> 49:36.120
Thanks, Jeezy.

49:36.120 --> 49:40.120
There's so many options out there now for that kind of stuff.

49:40.120 --> 49:43.120
I don't know how YouTube feels about it, but it seems clear that there's a need

49:43.120 --> 49:44.120
and a demand for that kind of thing.

49:44.120 --> 49:45.120
Absolutely.

49:45.120 --> 49:49.120
You can find a link to that as well as everything else we've talked about

49:49.120 --> 49:56.120
and the news stories and all of that over at linuxunplug.com slash 319.

49:56.120 --> 49:58.120
And Wes, did you know we do this here show live?

49:58.120 --> 49:59.120
Oh, yeah, every Tuesday.

49:59.120 --> 50:01.120
It's probably a good thing you knew that because if you didn't,

50:01.120 --> 50:03.120
we'd need to have a separate conversation.

50:03.120 --> 50:04.120
Yeah, that's true.

50:04.120 --> 50:05.120
It would be really awkward.

50:05.120 --> 50:06.120
It would be weird.

50:06.120 --> 50:08.120
How has my timing been so good all this time?

50:08.120 --> 50:10.120
It's just lucky, I guess.

50:10.120 --> 50:14.120
Go get more Wes over at TechSnap.systems, him and Jim Salter doing their thing.

50:14.120 --> 50:15.120
That's right.

50:15.120 --> 50:16.120
Over at TechSnap program.

50:16.120 --> 50:17.120
Loving that every single week.

50:17.120 --> 50:20.120
And do join us live.

50:20.120 --> 50:24.120
If you want to know when, jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

50:24.120 --> 50:26.120
You can also just follow us on the Twitters.

50:26.120 --> 50:27.120

Yeah.

50:28.120 --> 50:29.120
That's for sure.

50:29.120 --> 50:30.120
I'm at Chris Elias.

50:30.120 --> 50:31.120
I'm at Westpane.

50:31.120 --> 50:33.120
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

50:33.120 --> 50:34.120
So go check that out.

50:34.120 --> 50:36.120
Also, go check out our buddies' Ubuntu podcast.

50:36.120 --> 50:37.120
Go check them out.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.120
Oh, yeah.

50:38.120 --> 50:39.120
Why not?

50:39.120 --> 50:42.120
Always cutting out a good episode, those guys, every single week.

50:42.120 --> 50:44.120
So go check them out.

50:44.120 --> 50:47.120
And join us next time, linuxunplug.com slash 319.

50:47.120 --> 50:49.120
Thanks so much for joining us.

50:49.120 --> 51:18.120
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

51:19.120 --> 51:36.120
It's an episode of transitions.

51:36.120 --> 51:37.120
Think about this.

51:37.120 --> 51:38.120
No kidding.

51:38.120 --> 51:41.120
So we talk about Richard Stallman resigning.

51:41.120 --> 51:44.120
We talk about PowerShell on Linux.

51:44.120 --> 51:45.120
What?

51:45.120 --> 51:50.120
And Manjaro becoming a legitimate business and like the top tier Linux distributions

51:50.120 --> 51:51.120
shifting.

51:51.120 --> 51:58.120
Like this episode really reflects a really kind of massive amount of change going on.

51:58.120 --> 52:06.120
And it's like part exciting and part somber because it's, you know, the somber side, it's,

52:06.120 --> 52:10.120
you know, seeing somebody like Richard Stallman who is so well known in our community and

52:10.120 --> 52:14.120
the technical contributions he's made have been so important to...

52:14.120 --> 52:18.120
I mean a passionate free software advocate and shaped their discourse for a long time.

52:18.120 --> 52:19.120
Yeah.

52:19.120 --> 52:27.120
And then also yet undeniably a troublesome personality for a long time that there was

52:27.120 --> 52:29.120
going to be some kind of reckoning.

52:29.120 --> 52:36.120
And it's just to see that thing, to see all of that go down while also seeing the nature

52:36.120 --> 52:43.120
and basic use of free software and open source radically shifting with Microsoft and just

52:43.120 --> 52:48.120
the massive, massive deployment of cloud infrastructure and all of the people that are

52:48.120 --> 52:50.120
writing software for that.

52:50.120 --> 52:57.120
And also at the same time Manjaro becoming a company to me seems to be a clear indicator

52:57.120 --> 53:00.120
that there is still a market for desktop Linux.

53:00.120 --> 53:02.120
Like I thought we were done with this.

53:02.120 --> 53:03.120
I thought we were all done with this.

53:03.120 --> 53:05.120
We'd had it, you know, everybody gave their shot.

53:05.120 --> 53:09.120
The people that could make it work had usually other commercial backings to them like obvious

53:09.120 --> 53:12.120
reasons why they were in the market.

53:12.120 --> 53:14.120
And then Manjaro came along.

53:14.120 --> 53:17.120
It's like an unexpected little bright star in the Linux constellation.

53:17.120 --> 53:20.120
And it seems to validate the market a little bit.

53:20.120 --> 53:22.120
It's not necessarily like a foregone conclusion.

53:22.120 --> 53:23.120
It's not.

53:23.120 --> 53:24.120
But it's a data point.

53:24.120 --> 53:25.120
It's a signal.

53:25.120 --> 53:26.120
Yeah.

53:26.120 --> 53:27.120
It's exciting to watch too.

53:27.120 --> 53:30.120
I mean it's not all that surprising Chris.

53:30.120 --> 53:35.120
If you think about projects with their own self-commercial backing like elementary OS

53:35.120 --> 53:40.120
being a thing and there's a number of other ones like I mean Endless is one of those

53:40.120 --> 53:43.120
that are closer to the failed state than a lot of other ones.

53:43.120 --> 53:48.120
But they're all almost every single desktop Linux distribution project that has existed

53:48.120 --> 53:54.120
has either pivoted some other way or refocused or even pivoted back or something like that.

53:54.120 --> 54:00.120
It's the fact that desktop Linux still exists today after almost what 20 years of ragging

54:00.120 --> 54:05.120
and attempts and stuff like that I think kind of proves that there is some degree of staying

54:05.120 --> 54:11.120
power but we probably just don't quite understand where the pieces fit just yet into making

54:11.120 --> 54:13.120
it like broadly successful.

54:13.120 --> 54:14.120
I think that's fair.

54:14.120 --> 54:15.120
Yeah.

54:15.120 --> 54:16.120
Yeah.

54:16.120 --> 54:17.120
We'll keep trying.

54:17.120 --> 54:24.120
I mean everyone from Red Hat to Endless to you know Manjaro and all the rest of them

54:24.120 --> 54:27.120
will all keep working at it and we'll see what happens.

54:27.120 --> 54:28.120
I think Manjaro too.

54:28.120 --> 54:34.120
I think it's fascinating about it is it's not sold as super approachable for new Linux

54:34.120 --> 54:35.120
users out of the box.

54:35.120 --> 54:38.120
You know get mom and dad started using a computer.

54:38.120 --> 54:44.120
It's a little bit more of a more sophisticated user's desktop.

54:44.120 --> 54:45.120
Right.

54:45.120 --> 54:46.120
Yeah.

54:46.120 --> 54:47.120
You're a Linux user.

54:47.120 --> 54:50.120
You want like a good solid desktop machine that you can use without a bunch of limitations.

54:50.120 --> 54:56.120
Even the concept of how it does its updates is more of an advanced user's concept than

54:56.120 --> 54:58.120
what people are used to when it comes to commercial operating systems.

54:58.120 --> 55:02.120
I have a bit of a theory here and this is the rise of DevOps.

55:02.120 --> 55:08.120
This is the rise of people using Linux at work and then thinking hmm this is quite good

55:08.120 --> 55:09.120
on the server.

55:09.120 --> 55:12.120
Why don't I give it a try on the desktop?

55:12.120 --> 55:13.120
What's the worst that could happen?

55:13.120 --> 55:14.120
Right.

55:14.120 --> 55:19.120
And there is some nice advantages to the desktop being rolling because if you want fresh user

55:19.120 --> 55:20.120
land applications.

55:20.120 --> 55:21.120
I do.

55:21.120 --> 55:22.120
I do.

55:22.120 --> 55:26.120
And you want fresh whatever like for me it would be Gnome Shell if I was a Gnome Shell

55:26.120 --> 55:27.120
user.

55:27.120 --> 55:28.120
Such a sucker for that.

55:28.120 --> 55:30.120
Got to get the latest XSE every four years.

55:30.120 --> 55:32.120
You know there's some advantages.

55:32.120 --> 55:36.120
Really what it is about getting fresh Chrome and fresh Firefox and new Thunderbird and

55:36.120 --> 55:41.120
getting all of these applications that are just in a repository automatically updated.

55:41.120 --> 55:44.120
When you come from Windows or Mac OS that's all luxury.

55:44.120 --> 55:48.120
It's a yearly thing where you got to upgrade your operating system on Mac OS.

55:48.120 --> 55:50.120
They do that every year.

55:50.120 --> 55:52.120
Oh you mean it works just like the Play Store?

55:52.120 --> 55:53.120
Yeah right.

55:53.120 --> 55:59.120
So the advantages of rolling for somebody who's just using it as a workstation as long

55:59.120 --> 56:02.120
as it doesn't break anything are pretty appealing.

56:02.120 --> 56:04.120
They're hand holding in the right places.

56:04.120 --> 56:07.120
Aren't you Mr. Fedora that wants to upgrade every nine months?

56:07.120 --> 56:12.120
I think Fedora is a better cadence because you still get fresh applications but it's

56:12.120 --> 56:15.120
not like rolling constantly.

56:15.120 --> 56:19.120
And that to me is just a little bit slower and that's just the preference I like.

56:19.120 --> 56:22.120
But I can totally appreciate the appeal for the desktop still.

56:22.120 --> 56:24.120
I kind of miss it sometimes.

56:24.120 --> 56:31.120
So the other thing on the flip side of this with the pure rolling environment, then the

56:31.120 --> 56:37.120
major difficulty that you'll start having is how do you make sure everything stays working

56:37.120 --> 56:39.120
more or less forever.

56:39.120 --> 56:43.120
One of the reasons why most distributions have a cadence is so that they can have a

56:43.120 --> 56:47.120
choke point or a break point in which they can make changes.

56:47.120 --> 56:51.120
My experience with working in OpenSUSE of Tumbleweed and other rolling distributions

56:51.120 --> 56:56.120
is that it gets extremely hard to make major changes without breaking people unless you

56:56.120 --> 56:59.120
have those kinds of release points.

56:59.120 --> 57:07.120
And so one of the challenges I'm watching out for to see how Manjaro handles it is that

57:07.120 --> 57:11.120
how are they going to handle when they need to make a major change and then they have

57:11.120 --> 57:18.120
to make sure that that works and it upgrades and it handles cleanly and as they grow as

57:18.120 --> 57:21.120
a business because that's what they're going to do.

57:21.120 --> 57:27.120
There's going to be people filing bug reports expecting some kind of assistance or help

57:27.120 --> 57:28.120
or fixes or things like that.

57:28.120 --> 57:34.120
You get into an interesting mess that you don't typically have as a community project

57:34.120 --> 57:38.120
that doesn't have a commercial sponsor.

57:38.120 --> 57:41.120
I don't know how they're going to handle this and I'm kind of playing the wait and see to

57:41.120 --> 57:44.120
see how this will shake out.

57:44.120 --> 57:49.120
So one of the reasons we don't really see rolling do this is because this is really,

57:49.120 --> 57:55.120
really hard to do right in that commercial-ish context, even for home users, especially for

57:55.120 --> 58:02.120
home users who don't necessarily have that same level of patience that maybe enterprise

58:02.120 --> 58:05.120
users can be pushed back into.

58:05.120 --> 58:12.120
I also feel that when people pay money, they feel like entitled and then if a rolling release

58:12.120 --> 58:18.120
breaks after they paid for it in some way, shape or form, then the backlash is going

58:18.120 --> 58:19.120
to be much bigger.

58:19.120 --> 58:24.120
Well, maybe that's a market opportunity to sell us a service support contract.

58:24.120 --> 58:28.120
I mean, maybe it kind of depends on how they set the expectation.

58:28.120 --> 58:33.120
I think it's fascinating because it's not your typical distro to go for this kind of

58:33.120 --> 58:34.120
thing.

58:34.120 --> 58:35.120
Clearly, there's a community behind it.

58:35.120 --> 58:40.120
And also of note, we're talking a lot about workstation, but a big part of the community

58:40.120 --> 58:41.120
there is clearly gaming, too.

58:41.120 --> 58:45.120
That's what's got so much attention on YouTube.

58:45.120 --> 58:46.120
It's something to watch.

58:46.120 --> 59:12.120
As I say, the end of summer is always interesting in open source land.
