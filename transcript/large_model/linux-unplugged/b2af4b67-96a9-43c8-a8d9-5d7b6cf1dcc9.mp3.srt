1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
How about this one, Wes?

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,920
A new way to attack Internet of Things systems is with some sort of wireless Doppler effect?

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,520
It's not really, come on, not really.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,760
Did you grok anything from this?

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,860
Yeah, okay, so it may be that there are some attacks here, but it can also be useful just

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,200
for communication.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,720
And the central insight is protocols are robust, right?

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,240
So like a lot of stuff, think like FM radio, right?

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,920
You do frequency zone modulations that you're sort of shifting frequencies, but nothing's

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,920
exact, right?

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,760
There's all kinds of interference when you're sending out signals in Wi-Fi or Bluetooth

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,760
low energy.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,760
Oh, for sure.

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,320
So the protocols and algorithms have plans for that.

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,000
They can handle some drift there.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,960
So this is a new technique that basically abuses that and injects what looks like valid

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,840
legacy traffic or repeats valid legacy traffic with slight modifications to the frequency,

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,000
which bypasses any sort of the checks.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,640
So with intolerance for stuff like whatever your physical layer, the actual Wi-Fi chipset

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,600
or the Bluetooth chipset, and then that data, once it's in the hand of something a little

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,680
bit higher in the stack, can be coded as actual communication.

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,240
And one of the problems that they're trying to solve is you have a whole bunch of IoT

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,040
devices with Bluetooth low energy that can't talk that far, but you have Wi-Fi that's permeating

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,040
the area.

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
All the things.

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,860
With this, maybe you could tie them together.

27
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:37,040
That's your Science Moment with Wes.

28
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,260
Welcome into Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that has not one, but multiple

29
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,720
celebrations this week.

30
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
My name is Chris.

31
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
My name is Wes.

32
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,720
Hello, Wes.

33
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
We really have a great show.

34
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,120
We have some things to celebrate this week.

35
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,720
We'll tell you about that in just a moment.

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,080
But as always, we've got some great community news that will probably spur some discussion

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,680
with our virtual lug.

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,720
And then later on in the show, some are saying desktop Linux is collapsing, that it's in

39
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
trouble.

40
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,360
It has a motivation problem in development, and it has an adoption problem.

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,840
And some statistics actually back that up.

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,680
We'll look at these sobering numbers and then get into a wider conversation about the future

43
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,360
of Linux desktop and how it might look a little different than maybe what we're used to, what

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
we're expecting, you might say.

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,480
We'll tell you more about that in a little bit if we get there.

46
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,240
But before we go any further, it is my duty to bring in that virtual lug.

47
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
Time appropriate greetings.

48
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
Mumble room.

49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
Hello.

50
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
Hello.

51
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Hello.

52
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,400
I hear an L in cheese in there too.

53
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Hello to you guys.

54
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,720
Nice to have you guys.

55
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,400
Nice to have you there.

56
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,880
L is our community architect, and cheese is the designer here at the Jupyter Broadcasting

57
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
Network.

58
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,960
The Linux Academy, what, about a month ago now, cheese?

59
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,680
It's been about 30 days or so?

60
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,680
Yeah.

61
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,160
The 11th will be a month.

62
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
Huh.

63
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Gosh.

64
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
And you've already done so much.

65
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
Yeah.

66
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
We'll get to that.

67
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,600
But Brandon's here in the mumble room as well as Mini Mac, and I see Neon Popey, of course.

68
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Not regular Popey.

69
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
We don't want him.

70
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,160
You got PieCrash in there, Social Happiness from System76 in there rocking it out, Tats

71
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,720
in there as well, Turth and Wimpy.

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,320
So we have a great showing.

73
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
Amazing.

74
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
We have a great showing.

75
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,640
Something that I've actually been really enjoying recently is we've been able to start the show

76
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,120
out with some birthday announcements.

77
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
Yeah.

78
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,400
So this is like now three weeks in a row, right?

79
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
It's a record.

80
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
It is.

81
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
It is.

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
This is super cool.

83
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,720
So first of all, happy birthday to my co-host, Mr. Wes Payne.

84
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,800
Oh, thank you very much.

85
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,280
Today is Wes's birthday.

86
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,360
We just got done celebrating with a little podcast grilling.

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,120
We did a great job too.

88
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
Killed it.

89
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
Perfect birthday present.

90
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
Killed it.

91
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
Killed it.

92
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,280
So if we fall asleep halfway through the show, it's from the meat sleeps.

93
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,000
So happy birthday to you, Wes.

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's awesome that you're here today on your birthday.

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,720
I can't think of a place I'd rather be.

96
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Oh, shucks.

97
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,280
And also happy 14th anniversary to good old Git.

98
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
Happy birthday.

99
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,280
That's right.

100
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
Yeah.

101
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,280
We're super excited here in the studio.

102
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,800
We have a lot of people in studio today.

103
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,480
I have them behind the soundproof door right now.

104
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,680
So we've closed off the studio from the rest of the party.

105
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,800
Today we are doing our official launch party on air.

106
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,400
And so there's probably 60 to 70 people, more people arriving outside the studio right now.

107
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,600
We better hurry up because there's not enough air to go around.

108
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,720
There's one speaker out there.

109
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,920
We said you can't come in the studio.

110
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,200
We're closing the soundproof door.

111
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,760
We don't want to hear you.

112
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
There's one speaker.

113
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,560
You can all huddle around if you want to listen and otherwise eat your meat.

114
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,040
That's pretty much it.

115
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,240
So we'll get to that in a little bit.

116
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,960
But I thought maybe we should start with a little community news this week as we do here

117
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,440
on the old podcast.

118
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,920
And we have some interesting data now.

119
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Look back at it.

120
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,560
It's been a few months since Proton released and one graph really kind of sums it up.

121
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,120
We'll have it linked in the show notes.

122
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,480
Seven to eight months ago, Proton comes out and now we have some major milestones, don't

123
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
we?

124
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
Yeah, we do.

125
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Okay.

126
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,680
September 2018 was the biggest jump in compatibility by far.

127
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,240
And that kind of makes sense if you think about what happened around that time around

128
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,840
announcements and the work that had just been put in on the platform and then less spectacular

129
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,280
but steady improvements around up until the end of the last year.

130
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,580
Now January and February of this year were pretty calm.

131
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,080
Only one new Proton release basically in all of mid-February.

132
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:20,900
March 2019 though is special because we saw a release of Proton 4.2 at the very end.

133
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,000
But it was still sufficient to bring enough new reports.

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,600
I guess the picture here is there's been less hype, right?

135
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,480
We've talked about Proton but kind of because we're all still thinking about it, not because

136
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,000
there's been so much movement on their side.

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,920
It's been like a slow and steady where it's this weird thing where different aspects of

138
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,520
the stack get updated at different times.

139
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,320
So it's kind of hard to track from like an enthusiast standpoint unless you're really

140
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
following it closely.

141
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,880
But I think the net result of the work is pretty good.

142
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,720
The net result is there's a lot of Windows games that didn't formally work on Linux that

143
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,280
now are playing great under Proton.

144
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,600
Actually from that perspective it feels like a different world now that we're in the post-Proton

145
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
era.

146
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,240
That's why I was kind of surprised that they painted this picture this way.

147
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,280
It's only really a start though.

148
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,840
I think that's sort of the expectation to remember is it's only, we're not even a year

149
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
into it.

150
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,840
I mean there are still many games, especially a lot of games that maybe are less popular,

151
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,840
some niche markets that just aren't well served by any of this and there are just some pathological

152
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,920
cases where it's not going to work.

153
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,000
So it's all well and good to say like look at how far we've come.

154
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,800
I think there's still plenty of Linux users who wish they could stop dual booting.

155
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Yeah.

156
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Yeah.

157
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Yeah I think that's probably true.

158
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:37,160
While we're talking about games, not related to Valve at all, but Lutris, which is another

159
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,440
like a game platform alternative, has another update.

160
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,080
They've been cranking them out recently.

161
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,240
So check this out.

162
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,760
This is another great way they have, I can't remember quite what it's called, because I

163
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,400
use Lutris sparingly, but I think it's pretty great when I do use it and they've recently

164
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,280
done really good integration with GOG.

165
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
Oh yeah.

166
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,840
Lutris describes itself as an open source gaming platform that makes gaming on Linux

167
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,240
easier, but basically manage installing and providing optimal settings for games, which

168
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,000
is probably why you like it so much.

169
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah.

170
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah.

171
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,520
And they've just, version 0.52 adds the Vulkan ICD, which is the installable client driver,

172
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,820
into the system options and adds a sample count option for wine to enable certain types

173
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:22,480
of anti-aliasing, and there's now like better detection about an improper wine setup, wine

174
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
and Vulkan setup.

175
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
Like if you have a bad combo.

176
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,520
See, that's nice because that's already making me a little scared to go troubleshoot.

177
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
That sounds complicated.

178
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
And if you just want to play a game, that's the last thing you want.

179
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,720
And you know, not too long ago they relaunched, or not relaunched, but they just updated their

180
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,960
UI to GTK3, like in the 0.5 release.

181
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,440
See, that is slow and steady.

182
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,960
I mean, we needed that to happen.

183
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
So that's great.

184
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,360
Now, two really great projects out there, two really great projects out there.

185
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,920
So check out Lutris if you haven't before.

186
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,740
It's a great way to bring in a lot of different game stores, including Steam.

187
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,880
You can install the Steam runtime stuff and all of that too.

188
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,000
We have a couple of topic experts for our next story in the community news.

189
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,560
I wanted to put this in here because I think, and you guys correct me if I'm wrong, I believe

190
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,860
I sort of watched the beginning of this process, which was now a very long time ago when I

191
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,880
attended a canonical Snap Sprint, and it was either the first or the second one I attended,

192
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,560
and Microsoft was there talking about snapping up VS Code.

193
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,520
And that might have been almost two years ago now?

194
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
Yeah.

195
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,360
So you were at two sprints, and those were both attended by Visual Studio Code, one in

196
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:33,360
September of 2017, and then the following one in January of 2018.

197
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,100
And we'd started talking to them in May of 2017.

198
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:43,640
So that's how long it takes to work with an ISV and bring, you know, their already existing

199
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,680
Linux software to, you know, an app store type system.

200
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,160
I just want everybody to soak that in for a second.

201
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,800
Like, so the end result is an announcement, hey, VS Code is available as a snap now.

202
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
And you're like, oh, sure.

203
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Great.

204
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,880
Years, literally years of working with Microsoft to get this.

205
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,240
It's funny too, because almost my first reaction was like, oh, it wasn't there, there wasn't

206
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
one already?

207
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Yeah.

208
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
Yeah.

209
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
So this is the thing, right?

210
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,400
And I was the maintainer of it.

211
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,000
So yeah, we did that work in order to sort of, you know, test the system out in the very

212
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,560
early days.

213
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:28,840
But then it's not enough just to say, oh, here's a snap of a Visual Studio Code.

214
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,180
Because you know, it's available via other means.

215
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,120
What's interesting with the snap of Visual Studio Code is that if you're using VS Code

216
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,840
on Windows and Mac, the updates appear in app, it tells you there's a new update and

217
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,480
that you should restart now and all of those sorts of things.

218
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,960
It's all very slickly integrated.

219
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,300
And one of the reasons why this was protracted is that Microsoft have embedded that same

220
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:56,920
capability in the snap of Visual Studio Code to bring it in feature parity with the versions

221
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,680
that you use on Windows and Mac.

222
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,120
And I think that's something we're going to start to see a little bit more of as we go

223
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
forwards now.

224
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
Yeah.

225
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,040
And I think it's important that you're talking about this, I think, because that's a tiny

226
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
little thing.

227
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,720
It sounds like a small feature, but it's one of those things in the product that makes

228
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,840
it feel like a robust editor that you're going to depend on.

229
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,520
And developers coming from Mac OS or Windows expect it.

230
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
Exactly.

231
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
Yeah.

232
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,240
And you know, one of the other things that's come out of this exercise is obviously Visual

233
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,680
Studio Code has a lot of users, Ubuntu has a lot of users, and Microsoft have been publishing

234
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:35,040
code insiders in store for about eight months now.

235
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,080
And lots of people are using that.

236
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:45,120
And that was really helpful for us and Microsoft to identify some teething troubles.

237
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,380
One of the things you will see cited around the internet, if you look in the right places,

238
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,560
is that snaps are slow to start.

239
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,680
And certainly, we experienced that.

240
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,880
And code was one of the applications that had this problem.

241
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,600
So we dug into that with them and we fixed this in the back end of last year.

242
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,840
And all of those fixes landed in sort of early January after the Christmas break.

243
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:19,360
But we've recently written a blog post about how we profiled all of that stuff and used

244
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,360
Visual Studio Code across a number of different distributions to understand what the impact

245
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,720
was and what was actually causing this problem.

246
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,560
And consequently, snaps are faster, not just for code, but for a whole raft of applications

247
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
now.

248
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,120
And through doing that work, we've got some ideas in the future about how we can improve

249
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,760
the performance further still.

250
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,720
So it's been a very worthwhile process all the way through, really.

251
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Yeah.

252
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,680
Everybody appreciates faster application startup time.

253
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,680
So that's going to benefit a lot of users.

254
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,520
And congratulations to you guys for sticking with it and working with Microsoft, because

255
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,840
that is the process.

256
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,600
That is what it is like to work with large corporations.

257
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,400
And it's totally normal.

258
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,880
And so part of the behind the curtain stuff that we don't see is the work that goes down,

259
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,720
the in-person meetings, the emails, the months and months of communicating.

260
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,720
That boring sort of just following up, nothing exciting but checking in, how's it going?

261
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,240
And something that is totally you will never see, but when organizations work together,

262
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,040
there's legal process you have to go through.

263
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,800
When you've got something in a store, and it's a trademarked thing, and there are logos

264
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,280
and icons and all of that, that all needs to be squared away with legal people on both

265
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
sides of the fence.

266
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,040
And there's months of work involved in just getting that right.

267
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,080
It's really easy to take a deb of something from some random place that it's been published,

268
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,240
and then repackage it up and stick it in the AUR, for example.

269
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,720
I did that back in the past when I was involved in the arch community.

270
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,860
It was a real simple thing to do.

271
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,800
But when you're doing it as two organizations working together, there's a whole additional

272
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,320
bit of process you have to go through to do it legitimately.

273
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
I would imagine.

274
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,880
I would imagine that's putting it lightly.

275
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,360
Well, that's super cool.

276
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,700
And I think we have a couple of boots on the code right here that have loaded it up and

277
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,700
tried it.

278
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,800
I believe, Mr. Cheese, you've become a VS Code user, correct?

279
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,280
Yes, I have.

280
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,200
Actually just kind of trying the editors, I haven't done a lot of editing recently or

281
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,880
coding recently.

282
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,800
So it started with Sublime.

283
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,240
And then what killed me was whenever I tried to command S and save a file, and they prompted

284
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
me to pay them.

285
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
Yeah.

286
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
Yeah, that is annoying.

287
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,680
Well, immediately I was like, I got to find something else.

288
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,660
Then I found VS Code, pulled it from Microsoft, originally for the Mac, and then reloaded

289
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,840
a Mac with Linux this weekend, and then pulled the snap down and installed it that way.

290
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,680
Super quick, super simple.

291
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,020
Just worked right out of the box, man, it's so good.

292
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,020
So nice.

293
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,020
Huh.

294
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,020
Okay.

295
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,020
Stay a while and listen.

296
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,760
Elle, I'm curious about your experience because I think you said in our group chat too that

297
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,080
you've recently switched over to VS Code.

298
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,360
Are you using the snap?

299
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,520
And why did you go with a Microsoft editor?

300
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,440
So I must admit that I'm not as fancy as Cheese.

301
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,960
I come from using Vim.

302
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,640
So I was doing it old school.

303
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,180
And somebody turned me on to VS Code, telling me that it was actually integrated with Git.

304
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,280
So when I was doing things like pushing up my notes, I could just write it in Markdown.

305
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,640
There was something there already that told me if my Markdown wasn't compatible with what

306
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,780
was needed for GitHub, and then I could just push it when I was done.

307
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,960
So it just made my workflow a lot simpler.

308
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,120
Yeah, that does sound really handy.

309
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:49,260
You could do a whole episode on top quality extensions for Visual Studio Code that streamline

310
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,520
your workflow or supercharge things.

311
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,520
But one of the things it did this week, which I just loved, is I was working on some system

312
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,520
dunit files.

313
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,240
And I opened them up.

314
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,760
And then down in the bottom, it said, hey, there are extensions in the marketplace that

315
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,100
know what a service extension means.

316
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,100
Do you want to look at them?

317
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,860
I went, okay, then.

318
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,640
And then there was a bunch of tools for system dunit.

319
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,280
And I looked at a couple of them, I thought that one sounds good, install.

320
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:24,040
And then suddenly, I've got tooltips, expansions, and assistance around system dunit.

321
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,120
So it's like, oh, my goodness, this is brilliant.

322
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,640
So now as I open up random language files, because I'm doing some stuff with languages

323
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,680
at the moment, languages that I wouldn't ordinarily use, it says, oh, hey, I've noticed you've

324
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,680
opened something in Erlang.

325
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,480
Would you like to look at the Erlang extension?

326
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,680
You say, yes, please, and then you install some things.

327
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,040
And suddenly, you know, this language that doesn't mean much to you is now decorated

328
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,600
with all sorts of useful hints and advice.

329
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
It's brilliant.

330
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Very easy.

331
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Yeah, much easier to make it readable.

332
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Erlang, eh?

333
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,160
What are you doing with Erlang?

334
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
It's a long story.

335
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
I thought it might be.

336
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
You don't need to hear it.

337
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,200
Oh, I don't know about that.

338
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,360
That was just one example.

339
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,100
Well, we have another SnapGraph summit as we're on the topic.

340
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,520
We have another SnapGraph summit coming up in June.

341
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,600
This one's going to be in Montreal in Canada.

342
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,480
And we're partnering with, we're co-hosting the event with Travis CI.

343
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,240
So this time around, there's a focus on language ecosystems.

344
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
So we're doing lots of work with languages at the moment.

345
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Oh, neat.

346
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,840
I'm sure some interesting developments will come.

347
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
That does sound cool.

348
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,880
Well, stick around.

349
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
We have more to talk about.

350
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,560
I wanted to give a quick update.

351
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,360
There is a distribution that's kind of unique that we, I don't even know if it's fair to

352
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,800
call it a distribution.

353
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,320
We've talked about it before on this show and on Linux Action News.

354
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,640
It was formerly known as WLinux.

355
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:48,400
And it was Linux in the Microsoft Store that was optimized for the Windows subsystem for

356
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
Linux.

357
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Right.

358
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,760
To give you the best Linux experience on Windows.

359
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,940
And to their credit, they've actually been contributing bugs, bug fixes upstream.

360
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,240
They recently collaborated with the Berkeley DB team at Oracle and the WSL team at Microsoft

361
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,560
to solve a bug that was nagging WSL performance.

362
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,640
That's pretty great.

363
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,200
They say they detected a bug in Fedora packaging tools and reported it upstream in time for

364
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,020
Fedora 30.

365
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,440
So they're doing stuff.

366
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,200
And that's just top of the iceberg, whatever it is.

367
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
That is pretty neat.

368
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Yeah.

369
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,480
And regardless of whether you want to pay for an operating, whatever you want to call

370
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,840
this distribution set of software tools to run on your proprietary operating system or

371
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,800
not, it's neat to show that they're stress testing the stuff.

372
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
They're working.

373
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
They're putting in work.

374
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,920
So if you want to run some other operating system, there's going to be upstream benefits.

375
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,040
And it shows that there's clearly interest on both sides.

376
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,800
They're getting some good support from Microsoft.

377
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,860
So people who want to run more Linux on Windows, you're in luck.

378
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,860
So there's a big change coming.

379
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,860
You ready?

380
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,860
Oh.

381
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,860
They're changing their name from WL Linux.

382
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,860
Oh, what?

383
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,860
OK.

384
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,860
OK.

385
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,880
And I'm getting this wrong because it's based on a Japanese pronunciation that is probably

386
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,260
pronounced Pengin.

387
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,480
But so I think that's how you pronounce it is Pengin.

388
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,400
It's going to be P-E-N-G-W-I-N.

389
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,960
So not Penguin.

390
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
But Penguin.

391
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,280
So that's based on Japanese pronunciation.

392
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,200
But you got the win in there, which is kind of a hint.

393
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,600
And Hayden Barnes was interviewed by The Register.

394
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,040
And he said that, well, you know, come on, WLinux was only supposed to be the code name.

395
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,400
It wasn't going to be like the main name or anything like that.

396
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,480
It's also a massive misnomer as well, because the one thing it didn't have in it was Linux.

397
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,480
All right.

398
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,480
All right.

399
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,480
OK.

400
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,560
It's a distribution that's entirely absent of a Linux kernel.

401
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,680
So I guess that's another good reason to rename it.

402
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,440
That kind of invokes Cygwin in my mind.

403
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Yeah.

404
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
Absolutely.

405
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
And they spoke over here.

406
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
And The Register did too.

407
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
Isn't it pronounced Penguin?

408
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
Well, I don't know here.

409
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,400
It says he added it is close to the Japanese pronunciation and transliteration of Penguin,

410
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,720
which is Pengin.

411
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,840
In The Register, they spelled it as the pronunciation is P-E-N-G-I-N, you know, like gin, the drink.

412
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,680
Sounds like the Texas pronunciation.

413
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,680
It does.

414
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
The old Penguin.

415
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,000
Then you mix in Cygwin, and you get Penguin.

416
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I don't know.

417
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yeah.

418
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Maybe.

419
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I could see it.

420
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Hopefully, you don't have to say it.

421
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You just have to install it.

422
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yeah.

423
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I don't.

424
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,200
I've never actually tried it.

425
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,600
So one of these days, I'll get around to it.

426
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Get around and install it.

427
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
You never tried?

428
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Have you tried the subsystem?

429
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,440
I think once, maybe, briefly.

430
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,600
I guess this is just a testament to the limited amount of Windows in your life.

431
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,920
I don't have a functioning Windows install anywhere.

432
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:33,200
I do have a partition on my ThinkPad that if I wanted to go through the process of setting

433
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,080
up Grub to boot it, I could actually probably boot it.

434
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,080
So you're close.

435
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,080
I think.

436
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,720
But yeah, I haven't been in Windows in a very, very long time.

437
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,840
It may have now been multiples of years.

438
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,880
It's funny, we were just talking about this off air, that neither of us are in a position

439
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,340
where we have a regular Windows install that we're using, even in a VM.

440
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,200
There's actually enough open source stuff happening over in the Windows world.

441
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,560
There's been stuff we wanted to try but could not.

442
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,560
The downsides of an all Linux lifestyle.

443
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,120
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

444
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
That's true.

445
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,120
That's true.

446
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,120
All right.

447
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,120
Well, there you go.

448
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,280
If you have any experience with WL, well, now PENGIN, or maybe if you have any experience

449
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:15,880
with how you pronounce it, let us know, linuxunplugged.com slash contact and send us in a note.

450
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
Let us know.

451
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
Please do.

452
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
We need to go check in on that party.

453
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,760
With that door closed, I can't really tell they're out there.

454
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Yeah, that's dangerous.

455
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,480
So let's get to a little housekeeping first.

456
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:31,500
First up on the housekeeping list this week, go check out Coder Radio 352.

457
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,780
That's coder.show slash 352.

458
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:42,520
If nothing else, Wes covered his super crazy, awesome, run out of RAM setup.

459
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:48,080
He has an Ubuntu 1904 complete working environment where he's editing podcasts and everything,

460
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,100
all running out of RAM.

461
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,880
And he covered the entire setup in episode 352.

462
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
You could do it right now.

463
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
Absolutely.

464
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,360
It's just using stuff built into Linux.

465
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,760
Actually, I was running it this morning.

466
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,560
I don't know why you're not in there all the time, dude.

467
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,000
It runs as fast at the speed of RAM.

468
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It is pretty snappy.

469
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,160
I would live in there.

470
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,160
I would live in there.

471
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,920
So that was a, I just, it really is a segment we could have done in this show.

472
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,680
But you and I just were last minute filling in for Mike.

473
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:20,500
And so we were just talking about whatever, just shooting the S and it came up.

474
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,520
And so go listen to that episode because it really should be a segment in this show.

475
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,520
Yeah.

476
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
And go give it a try too.

477
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
I'd be curious.

478
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
I linked some docs.

479
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
There's some pretty good documentation on how to do it.

480
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,880
But I'd be curious to see if other people find it suitable on their systems.

481
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,360
And there's also a really cool opportunity.

482
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,920
We'll have a link in the show notes.

483
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,780
It's generally like $1,000.

484
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:44,320
But there is an opportunity for women and underrepresented groups from untapped pathways

485
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,640
to go attend the up and coming 2019 Grace Hopper celebration, which is a big ticket

486
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,640
item to get in there.

487
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,400
So if you can get in for free, if you're in that group, click the note in our show notes.

488
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,120
I think it'd be pretty awesome to be able to attend that.

489
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,400
Yeah, there's lots of good people to meet there, lots of good networking, and I'm sure

490
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,320
all kinds of stuff to see.

491
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,800
Grace Hopper was an amazing, I think she's passed, yeah?

492
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,520
Grace Hopper was an amazing woman.

493
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,880
Some really cool YouTube videos out there.

494
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,280
Some really cool YouTube videos.

495
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,820
Go look that up after the show.

496
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,080
And then last but not least, we're going through the housekeeping quick.

497
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,280
So we got to go check in on that party before they burn the studio down.

498
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:25,360
Last but not least, Linux Academy is hiring for a full stack Ruby on Rails developer position.

499
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,560
Full time, remote, with benefits, everything.

500
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,900
And they're looking to fill, I think a couple of them.

501
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,840
So if that might be you and you're looking for a change, link in the show notes.

502
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,040
Or go to linuxacademy.com slash careers to find your way there.

503
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,640
That could be a great opportunity.

504
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,160
And that, my friends, boom, is the housekeeping.

505
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,440
So we have so much to get into today.

506
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,440
So Cheese, why don't you come over here?

507
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,440
Let's go outside.

508
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,440
Open up the soundproof door there.

509
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
There we go.

510
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
Hey, everybody.

511
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,840
What up?

512
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,960
So this week, we are super excited to announce that the new Jupyter broadcasting logos have

513
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,280
rolled out.

514
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,480
The new Linux unplugged logo, all of the shows, the new look on the website.

515
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,320
And we want to just take a minute here.

516
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
Hold on.

517
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
You know what?

518
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,320
I can't.

519
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,320
This is so loud.

520
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
I can't focus with that door open.

521
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,320
Hold on.

522
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
I got to get rid of these people, OK?

523
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,320
You guys don't mind, right?

524
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,320
No, no.

525
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,320
The show comes first, right?

526
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
It doesn't.

527
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
Hey, guys.

528
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
Hey, guys.

529
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
Hey, tone it down.

530
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,320
Hey, you guys.

531
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
That's it.

532
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
That's it.

533
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
There we go.

534
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
Wow.

535
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:38,440
I forgot to tell you, I have to leave right after the show.

536
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,820
I can't help clean up.

537
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,320
So Wes, about that sous vide meat, are you sure?

538
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,320
That's better, right?

539
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,320
Sound quality is better now.

540
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,320
Way better.

541
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,320
Now, yeah, really, really super excited about this.

542
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,320
And I thought we'd talk a little bit about the sort of our intention behind it.

543
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,320
We won't take too long.

544
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
But people have had questions.

545
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,320
I think let's start with what's going to be the most controversial bit of art.

546
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,320
And then we'll go down from there.

547
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,320
And we'll talk about stuff.

548
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,760
So this has really been a group effort that started back in October with the Linux Academy

549
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,360
core design team, who came up with all of the original concepts.

550
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,360
Really good stuff.

551
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,360
They worked with us.

552
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,360
You know, we were going for clean, readable.

553
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,520
And we were trying to think about like the next 10 years.

554
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,280
And then about a month ago, Cheese came on the team and really took it over the finish

555
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,280
line.

556
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,680
Like last Friday, we were on a group call for eight hours with Wes and Cheese and Angela.

557
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,840
And like each one of us, like Angela's like uploading something to the website.

558
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,520
Wes is tweaking some CSS while Cheese is banging out a new logo and disabling old WordPress

559
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,520
plugins.

560
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
It was a massively parallel operation.

561
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,520
It was really.

562
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,640
It was very impressive.

563
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:48,980
And so now we have the new artwork out and the reaction has been pretty positive.

564
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,680
Some people don't like the new cloud logo for the network.

565
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,960
So that's the one I want to talk about first.

566
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
I want to talk about the reason we did that.

567
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,360
I was it was my choice.

568
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,200
I was all of all of the art was directed and led by us.

569
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,000
And we wanted to go everything clean, readable and modern.

570
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,080
And I was thinking about the next 10 years and I was thinking about what is going to

571
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,760
be mainstream Linux and open source use in the next 10 years.

572
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:19,600
And I mean, besides maybe mobile in like Android or something, it's going to be the cloud.

573
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,480
The cloud is made of Linux and free software, and I think we need to remember that.

574
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,520
We need to be reminded that this nebulous term is really just made up of different free

575
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,440
software and open source projects that are interconnected together in a way that provides

576
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,160
a service.

577
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:42,640
And I kind of felt like that was the future face in a way for mainstream users of Linux

578
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,300
and free software and open source.

579
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,580
And so I wanted our logo to sort of represent that a little bit.

580
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,560
And so that was the basis behind it.

581
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,240
But you want to talk a little bit about some of the show logos and some of the ideas there

582
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,400
and the we got the badge for people to recognize it.

583
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Take a minute.

584
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Talk about that stuff.

585
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
It's pretty awesome work.

586
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
So, yeah.

587
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,980
So, I mean, we went through we went through all of the logos.

588
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:11,160
First off, like Chris said, they worked with Linux Academy, and I'd like to give a big

589
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:18,800
thank you to those the Linux Academy art department, Ingrid and Alexander and, and since lean and

590
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,360
Joelle and everybody over there, they've been great.

591
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,420
And essentially, they, they, you know, gave me all the logos in a zip file.

592
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:32,320
We went through them and kind of looked at them and did some tweaking and modifying,

593
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,760
you know, to, to, to as best we could incorporate some, some new themes.

594
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,620
So you'll see the cloud, like Chris said, and that'll kind of going forward as we as

595
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:48,240
new shows are developed, you'll see that more and more.

596
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,240
And of course, we couldn't get Joe to change the user logo so that that one user is going

597
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,320
to user is going to stay the same one stays pretty close to the original to Yeah, that's

598
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,320
true.

599
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,880
Yeah, like some of them are just like modifications of the original logo, just bring them up to

600
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,320
date a little bit with new inspirations in there.

601
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
Absolutely.

602
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,000
I mean, like the rocket and the cloud in the Linux unplug logo had been, you know, recreated

603
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,040
that and you'll see that rocket in that cloud being used going forward in a lot of our designs.

604
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:22,000
The color palettes, again, were kind of based on we wanted to differentiate all the shows

605
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,340
the best we could but still kind of tie everything back so that whenever you saw it, you wouldn't,

606
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,880
you wouldn't think that it's not a Jupiter show.

607
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,480
Yeah, if you if you like Linux unplugged, you will you'll recognize user now, right?

608
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,840
If you like user area, you'll recognize the code of radio.

609
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,840
We didn't have that at all.

610
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,920
We didn't have any consistency across the shows in the brand just was just didn't have

611
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
the resources.

612
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:50,260
You know, I told Chris that I'll take the heat on the color on tech snap.

613
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,920
You know, the magenta, it's not pink.

614
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm sure I would I would I would hope that Emma likes it.

615
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,640
Oh, yeah.

616
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
But I like it, Emma.

617
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
She's a big pink pan fan.

618
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,560
But it was one of those things where, you know, guys, look, I realize red and black

619
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,440
is such a cool color combination.

620
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,340
But we also have to kind of differentiate that a little bit and bring in some other

621
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,720
colors and be able to work work with a wider palette of colors.

622
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,920
So you'll see that to going forward.

623
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:27,480
You'll also notice that on a lot of our graphics that we have a badge in the top left corner.

624
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,360
And that badge is just simply there to remind you without putting Jupiter Broadcasting on

625
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,360
on every single thing.

626
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,040
That little badge is there to remind you, you know, what show you're watching.

627
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,680
Those colors have been, you know, coordinated with the colors in the logos to match the

628
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,880
corners.

629
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,760
You'll see that across YouTube, the cast of Plasta that we actually push the shows out

630
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,000
with everywhere.

631
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,760
You'll see that kind of theme commonly used.

632
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,960
I think this really gives us a nice clean slate.

633
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,120
I know that I had worked with a lot of the J.B. logos before.

634
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,600
That's what's kind of awesome about this, actually, is really I mean, for nearly a decade,

635
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,880
you've been on and off in the circle creating artwork for us.

636
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,600
So it's it's kind of amazing that the first time we did like a one uniform roll out of

637
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,320
a whole new look, you were you were here to push us over the finish line like it's kind

638
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,320
of perfect.

639
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,320
Yeah.

640
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,400
And, you know, I think the timing was just was just perfect.

641
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,720
I do wish I had a little more time to spend with them and not that I think that there's

642
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,720
anything I would change right off the bat.

643
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:30,080
But you know, when you're developing stuff like that, the more time you get, the better.

644
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,240
But then I guess it can also be to detriment and kind of slow you down.

645
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,640
But it was a mad dash.

646
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,960
Well, I know that, you know, if we were to just talk about the color combinations and

647
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,260
maybe one day I'll show be able to show some of this other work to you guys.

648
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:50,840
But just the color combinations that went into Coder in an attempt to, you know, resemble

649
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:56,440
an editor and code highlights, if you're not a fan of the magenta, I guarantee there's

650
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,180
some of those designs for Coder that you would absolutely not love.

651
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:05,500
But if you love Miamis in the 90s, you would you would absolutely love them.

652
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,420
So there's just a ton of different changes that we made when it when it comes to that

653
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:15,400
and different color combinations and different ideas and and how do we make snap, snap?

654
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,920
How do you visually show that?

655
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,600
So there's a lot of thought that went into into the logos.

656
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Absolutely.

657
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,280
You've got to tell the people about I mean, we've got a lot of good feedback.

658
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,240
We've gotten, of course, some strong negative feedback, but we got we got probably the most

659
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,840
amazing feedback this morning on Telegram.

660
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,840
You tell people about that.

661
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
Yeah.

662
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,680
So so we got some feedback this morning from and I probably am going to butcher his name.

663
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,680
Kyrian.

664
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,240
I believe it's his name.

665
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,240
And he wrote in me.

666
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,240
I know.

667
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
Right.

668
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,440
And he wrote in to tell us that he's he's it's he's hard sided, so he doesn't have very

669
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,440
good vision.

670
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,120
And he struggled with the old logos and being able to determine and differentiate the logos

671
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,600
and the shows.

672
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:05,240
But now with the new logos and the very minimalist look of the new logos, he's able to actually

673
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
see these better.

674
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,840
And to me, that man, that is the best feedback I've gotten out of this whole turnaround with

675
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:21,200
these logos and with this rebranding to where someone actually gets is makes it more accessible

676
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
for them.

677
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,840
He's seen the logo for the first time, essentially.

678
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
Yeah.

679
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
And that's great, dude.

680
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,080
I mean, it literally made whenever I saw that comment, it made the the the hairs on my arms

681
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,920
stand up just reading it.

682
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,720
And it kind of speaks to the purpose to write.

683
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
We want to connect people.

684
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,080
I mean, the logos are good on themselves, but the whole point is to to bring you to

685
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,400
the content and get to listen to us.

686
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,400
Yeah.

687
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
And swag.

688
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:49,000
So, ladies and gentlemen, Westpain has the first round of stickers that we will have

689
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,480
at MinixFest Northwest.

690
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,480
I really hope you're playing the bongos.

691
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,920
I am.

692
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,920
Go for it.

693
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,200
West is opening the sticker box right now.

694
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,400
This is our first reveal of the new logos as stickers.

695
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,280
Oh, how do they look?

696
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,520
User error first out of the box.

697
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,800
User error coming out sharp.

698
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,560
The new user error sticker looks really good.

699
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,600
Now we've got a code radio.

700
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,320
Oh, man.

701
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
Nailed it.

702
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
Cheese.

703
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
I will take.

704
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
Don't worry.

705
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,320
We'll take pictures and send them to you.

706
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,320
Nailed the code radio.

707
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,600
Well, of course we needed Linux Unplugged.

708
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,200
The blues are perfect.

709
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
They're popping.

710
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,080
Oh, it's these.

711
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,800
Every one of these is nailing it so far.

712
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
This is so great.

713
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
OK.

714
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
OK.

715
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
Look at that.

716
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
Look at that.

717
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
That looks great.

718
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,360
And those BSD brethren.

719
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,800
And that's fun.

720
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,880
That is this is the BSD one looks even.

721
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,400
Even the BSD one.

722
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,680
Even the BSD one looks good.

723
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
Wow.

724
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,040
And perhaps the piece of resistance.

725
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,040
Linux Action News.

726
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,040
I love the cutout.

727
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,040
It's really nice.

728
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
That's die cut and fancy.

729
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,240
That die cut following the red box is slick.

730
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
And the network.

731
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,920
The network logo, which is a circular badge style sticker.

732
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,040
Man, these are top notch.

733
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,160
These are top.

734
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
These are our best stickers.

735
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,800
I mean, these logos were sort of designed around the idea of being able to do this.

736
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,840
But that is we'll be giving these away starting at Linux Fest Northwest and then down the

737
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:16,040
road we'll make them available to the community via various means, including the Linux Academy

738
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,400
gem store and other places.

739
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,460
So stay tuned.

740
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,460
That's all coming down the road.

741
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:23,380
But for now, at least initially, these stickers are only going to be available at Linux Fest

742
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,020
Northwest because we've just ordered a small batch.

743
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,620
And this is the first time I'm seeing these new logos.

744
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:32,720
This is for me is I'm disappointed that I haven't saved enough space on the back of

745
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
the thing.

746
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
I know.

747
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
I know.

748
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
We've got a sticker over it.

749
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,040
This is an emotional moment.

750
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,020
And I haven't had a chance to talk to Angela, but I bet for her, too.

751
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:47,680
This is just something we never had the scope to pull off where, you know, you could have

752
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:52,060
a designer sit with you on the phone for eight hours and crank out the different stuff as

753
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,320
you upload a Twitter badge and it looks like crap.

754
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,000
So you want a different version or you upload something to WordPress and it's too big.

755
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,760
So you need a different export and just sit there and bang all that stuff out like it

756
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,480
just wasn't something that was on our grasp before.

757
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,360
And so that's one of the great things about being part of the Linux Academy team is that

758
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,400
we have a little more reach now and we've been able to put together a pretty great team.

759
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
And so it's great to have you.

760
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
Cheese.

761
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Great work.

762
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Thanks, man.

763
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,400
And boy, these can't wait to send you pictures.

764
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
I'm super good.

765
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Good.

766
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
That looks so good.

767
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
Another another round of applause, guys.

768
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
Come on.

769
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
Those of you left the other round.

770
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Yeah.

771
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
Thank you.

772
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Really, really well done.

773
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
Man, that's great.

774
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
You know what?

775
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
We got to do another one of these two.

776
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,200
We got to do a little man.

777
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,620
We did it in one day.

778
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,280
We rolled out all the new art.

779
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,900
It feels good.

780
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,160
It took us like six months to roll out the new TexNap logo.

781
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,160
It was atrocious.

782
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,160
Why?

783
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Yeah.

784
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
OK.

785
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:47,640
So there is an article out that proclaims that the Linux desktop is in trouble and uses

786
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:53,320
recent statements by Linus and recent statements by Clem from Linux Mint and kind of comes

787
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,980
together on a theory that Linux desktop is in decline.

788
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,960
So I'll start with Linus's comments and then we'll start talking about this.

789
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,960
We'll discuss it.

790
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:07,400
SJVN writes on ZDNet, even Linus Torvalds is tired of the fragmentation in the Linux

791
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,400
desktop.

792
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,680
In a recent interview, Torvalds said the Chromebooks and Android are a path towards the desktop.

793
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,680
Now why?

794
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,200
He implies this because we don't have any standardized Linux desktop.

795
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:23,100
Torvalds wishes we were better at having a standardized desktop that goes across distributions.

796
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,800
You know, like Plasma and all.

797
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,960
Torvalds thinks there's been some progress for software installation, but at the same

798
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,800
time he is disappointed in the rivalry between Red Hat, which supports Flatpak, and Canonical,

799
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,120
which supports Snaps.

800
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
It bugs Torvalds.

801
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:41,080
He's annoyed how the fragmentation of different vendors has held the desktop back so far.

802
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,880
But he's not the only one that's grumpy right now.

803
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,880
Clem from Mint is a little grumpy as well.

804
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,080
He's been having some issues.

805
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,040
Clem writes, it's not always easy to achieve what we want.

806
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,480
Sometimes it's not even easy to define what we want to achieve.

807
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,280
We can have doubts, we can work really hard on something for a while and then question

808
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,840
it so much, we're not even sure we'll ship it.

809
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,840
We can get demotivated, uncertain, depressed, even by negative reactions or just normal

810
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
interactions.

811
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,480
And it can lead to developers stepping away from the project, taking a break or even leaving

812
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,480
for good.

813
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,520
Yeah, I believe one of their main mutter, or no, it's muffin, it's muffin, isn't it,

814
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,240
for Cinnamon, is having, is basically moving on.

815
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,600
And then there's something we've touched on in this program before, right, that especially

816
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,280
in the open source world, oftentimes these are, this is volunteer labor.

817
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,960
And so any extra emotional baggage, that's hard.

818
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,880
And Clem seems to indicate in the blog post over on the Mint site that it was really the

819
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:45,440
community's strong negative reaction to logo changes and other changes on the website that

820
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,840
were not actually related to the distribution per se.

821
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,280
And that began the process of demotivating the team.

822
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,120
So it's kind of funny that here we are doing a big art rollout.

823
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,160
And it also, I mean, it does, it kind of talks to you about, there are things other than

824
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,160
technical, right?

825
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
We've got a great kernel.

826
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,320
We might even have some great desktop software, but that's not necessarily what determines

827
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,400
our success.

828
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,080
So is desktop Linux collapsing, as SJVN writes?

829
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,920
Because now that Mint's having trouble, it must be collapsing.

830
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,860
I think this would be a good moment before we go any further.

831
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,480
So we're all on the same page.

832
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,300
We're all in alignment, as they say.

833
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:26,340
Perhaps we could take a moment and define what desktop Linux actually is, because we

834
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,280
may be talking about different things and not even realize it here.

835
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,840
Mr. Wimpers, would you like to take a crack at your definition of desktop Linux?

836
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,840
Yeah.

837
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:39,560
So quite often, some people will cite Chrome OS, for example, as desktop Linux because

838
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,200
it uses the Linux kernel.

839
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,560
And that doesn't fit my definition, and here's why.

840
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:52,400
I think of desktop Linux as a desktop Linux operating system where you are able to download

841
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:59,280
the source code for the current version of the kernel, compile it, install it, and reboot

842
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,200
and boot off that kernel that you've just compiled and built.

843
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,440
And if you can't do that, then in my mind, it's not desktop Linux.

844
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,080
That is not what I expected you to say at all.

845
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,740
Why is that ability important to you?

846
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,040
Is it something you actually use?

847
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,760
Well, not these days, but it's the very...

848
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,480
We talk about this general term of Linux, and that's the basis upon which this whole

849
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,880
platform sits on top of.

850
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:33,960
And things like Android and Chromium are the productization of the Linux kernel.

851
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,920
And this is great for Linus because all he cares about is the kernel and it becoming

852
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,960
more dominant and more widespread.

853
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:50,160
But from our point of view, it's usually the Linux kernel with embedded versions of user

854
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,080
space and that whole...

855
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,920
The thing that we like because of its flexibility and all that we can do with it is being taken

856
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,920
away from us.

857
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:05,160
So I think unless you've got compilers and the tool chain and the ability to compile,

858
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,440
build and then reboot your desktop operating system off the kernel that you've just built,

859
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,680
then it's not desktop Linux, it's something else.

860
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,720
I could accept that definition for the purposes of our discussion today.

861
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,420
Could you accept that definition?

862
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,360
It's an interesting bar, but I think it's a fascinating one.

863
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,920
If you can't stand it up yourself, it's not really a free desktop environment.

864
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,000
I mean, there are a lot of things I think that's an important philosophy in our community

865
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,840
in terms of being able to tinker and explore.

866
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,680
And those are often cited concerns about playing and learning from Linux.

867
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,120
You can get your work done on Linux or Windows, but if you want to go learn how to build computer

868
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:45,320
boots and be able to play with that and teach yourself, you probably need Linux or at least

869
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,880
something approaching Wimpy's definition.

870
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,560
I would say, however, that if I find myself compiling a kernel from source and having

871
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,240
to boot off it, I am reconsidering my life choices at that point as well.

872
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,040
This is not something that I think you need to be doing on a regular basis unless you're

873
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,920
a kernel developer or working on some new hardware device.

874
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,920
I think that it's that kind of flexibility that really expresses what distributions are

875
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,080
and their heritage, their legacy.

876
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,740
I think I'm inclined to agree because otherwise it's just a black box.

877
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,840
It's no different than a set-top box that's got a TiVo, that's got a pre-compiled kernel.

878
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,840
An appliance?

879
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,840
Yeah, it's an appliance.

880
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,320
And that's what a Chrome laptop or a Chrome box is.

881
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,920
Whereas something where you can go and get an ISO image and install it on the hardware

882
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:41,040
of your choice with choices you make at the software level is a completely different experience

883
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,960
than buying a box that is non-modifiable.

884
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,040
See, this is interesting because Chris, you and I, we've been talking a lot about in the

885
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,040
studio, appliances.

886
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,560
So it makes me question like, okay, that does seem like a very reasonable definition of

887
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,560
Linux desktop.

888
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,200
But does that mean I just don't want that much Linux desktop?

889
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,440
If we're okay with things like Chromebooks or tablets or that we do think are useful

890
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,880
or some do, does that just mean the Linux desktop wasn't the thing that was right?

891
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,880
Yeah.

892
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:13,680
I mean, I think Linus, as Wimpy very well pointed out, is completely happy with Linux

893
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,720
being an implementation detail because it's still using his kernel.

894
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,880
And that's a great observation.

895
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,080
And Linus has said as much himself.

896
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,480
I've actually heard Linus say as much himself in an interview.

897
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,760
So I think that's very astute.

898
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,640
And for the purpose of this conversation, I'm going to accept that definition.

899
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,840
And I'd love to hear the audience's definition, too.

900
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,600
So please do send it in.

901
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:41,060
But okay, so that version of the desktop, is that a failure in a sense?

902
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,920
So that's what SJVN's point is with these distributions struggling.

903
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,400
He writes, also he points out in this article, like a lot of popular desktop distributions

904
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:55,720
are getting by on a shoestring budget, barely holding it together, operating sort of like,

905
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,440
you know, month to month almost in terms of revenue.

906
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,040
We've seen issues with some smaller distributions recently.

907
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,800
You look at projects like Manjaro, Linux, and others, they're not making a ton of money.

908
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,780
You know, they're barely getting by essentially.

909
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,340
And so he says that that doesn't set them up for long term success.

910
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:20,300
And then, you know, you look at other numbers, like the valve market share numbers for Linux,

911
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:24,780
we're still sub 1% after all of this time.

912
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:31,620
In February 2019, we had a decent size, like 0.77%.

913
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:37,160
And now it looks like in March, now it may be edging up to 0.82%.

914
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,160
0.82.

915
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:45,440
I think those numbers are actually impressive, because that's against a backdrop of a rapidly

916
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:51,540
growing Steam user market when you take into account Windows.

917
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:59,120
So the fact that we're actually holding that, you know, slightly under 1% is actually growth

918
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,120
in real terms.

919
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,120
I'll agree with that.

920
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,120
Yeah, actually.

921
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,840
I mean, we have like some more descriptive statistics ideally, but that's a great point.

922
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:10,200
I've gotten like the Steam hardware survey once ever, ever.

923
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,600
I got it three times in one day.

924
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,600
And it was brilliant.

925
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,600
Wow.

926
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,600
Yeah.

927
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,600
I got it twice over the weekend.

928
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,600
Really?

929
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,600
Yeah.

930
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:23,160
I got it on my Linux PC, and I submitted it, and then got it on my Windows PC and said

931
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,160
no.

932
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,880
Good man.

933
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:34,000
If you're curious, Mac OS is at a healthy 3.27% market share, Windows coming in at 95.91%.

934
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,120
Okay, so I don't think that Linux is screwed.

935
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,240
I mean, I was kind of trying to, you know, get a little distract a little out of you

936
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,240
guys.

937
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,240
I don't think it is.

938
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,240
I think it's in pretty good shape.

939
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:52,440
Yeah, I think citing those smaller projects as it's all wobbly because those smaller projects

940
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,020
are struggling is looking in the wrong place, right?

941
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:01,080
Because it's unfortunate that those smaller distributions are struggling, and I hope that

942
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:05,320
they continue to go from strength to strength, and they get the funding that they need to

943
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,320
continue.

944
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:11,080
But that is not where the majority of Linux users are.

945
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:19,040
The majority of Linux users on the desktop are running Ubuntu or one of the derivatives.

946
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:26,280
I mean, Ubuntu is by far and away the most widely used Linux desktop operating system.

947
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:34,160
And second place is Mint, and Mint dwarfs most of the other Linux-based operating systems.

948
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,160
Right.

949
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,800
And in that article, Ubuntu is sort of dismissed out of hand.

950
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,440
Oh, Canonical is worried about the server.

951
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,680
I've got thoughts about that, if you want to dig into that.

952
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,680
I was curious.

953
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,440
I was curious what your thoughts are about that.

954
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,440
Right.

955
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,440
Okay.

956
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,700
So on that point about we only care about server, certainly, there's a lot of investment

957
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:57,360
of time and energy in server and cloud because yes, there's a lot of money and business opportunity

958
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,360
there.

959
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,040
But as a company, we care about the desktop.

960
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:08,560
And also personally, Mark Shuttleworth also still cares very much about the Ubuntu desktop.

961
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:15,960
He has limited time to spend looking at individual products within the Ubuntu product family.

962
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,720
But one of the products that he spends time personally looking into is the Ubuntu desktop.

963
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,560
So within Canonical, it's important to us.

964
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,760
So I don't buy that at all.

965
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,440
That is somebody from the outside speculating.

966
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:34,920
Also those Linux distributions, those tiny Linux distributions that are cited in the

967
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:43,240
article as having trouble, one could argue, why do they need to be super successful?

968
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,920
Because a lot of them are a couple of guys who are making something as a passion project

969
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,920
for themselves.

970
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,120
They don't necessarily need to make millions.

971
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,560
And for the majority of them that are based off of Ubuntu, or based off of Debian, they're

972
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,560
not even hosting their own archive.

973
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:04,640
So they're not even having to pay out, like if in the real world, they were a real proper

974
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:09,720
Linux desktop distribution, they would have their own archive, and they would have to

975
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,240
host gigabytes and gigabytes of packages, and they'd have to find somewhere to build

976
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,240
all of that software.

977
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,240
But they don't.

978
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,280
They rely on Ubuntu or Debian to do that for them.

979
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:26,440
And so I think they're doing pretty well, that any rando on the internet can spin up

980
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:33,040
a distro and manage to sustain it for probably years with very minimal investment.

981
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,960
And thanks, Mark, for paying for that hosting and the build system.

982
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,960
Thanks very much.

983
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,560
And the security team and the kernel team and all the rest of it.

984
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,300
So the argument really is a bit of a straw man.

985
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:48,120
And that's where I was going with this is I think Linux desktop is doing just fine.

986
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,040
It depends on which lens you're looking at.

987
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,640
In fact, Emma, you were kind of pointed out like even Linus himself, if you get him at

988
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,480
the right time of day, or you ask him the right question, he kind of has a totally different

989
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,480
opinion, doesn't he?

990
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:03,760
Yeah, and I think that the CDNIT always kind of sensationalizes and draws weird conclusions

991
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,040
that aren't necessarily the real situation.

992
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,040
Yeah.

993
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,040
Yeah.

994
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,040
Linus takes a long term look at it.

995
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,640
He says, like, long term, unless something major changes, I think Linux is going to own

996
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,640
the desktop.

997
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,880
It's just going to take a while to get there.

998
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:22,480
And I think part of it, too, is in a weird way, our fragmentation is actually going to

999
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,660
save us here.

1000
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,200
Stick with me for a second.

1001
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,880
I actually think the fact that and I use fragmentation very broadly here, my definition of fragmentation

1002
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,720
is multiple distributions, right, and all different kinds of architectures running all

1003
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:41,200
kinds of different form factors, like, in that sense, Linux is sort of always being

1004
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,500
built for all of these different edge cases, right?

1005
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,960
You combine that with the ability to compile it wherever you want and run it where you

1006
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,960
need it.

1007
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,620
And it can be the first thing in whatever next computing factors that exists.

1008
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:52,620
That's what I'm saying.

1009
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,440
It's a universal operating system that's generally available, that's great.

1010
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,720
That if there's the next hardware platform that takes off, if it's not, you know, whatever

1011
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:04,080
is after x86, if it's ARM or whatever, that becomes like the mainstream that we have in

1012
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,140
our laptops and desktops, Linux is there already.

1013
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,360
It's going to be there already.

1014
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,720
Anything that's in the market, it's going to have great support for it.

1015
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,100
It'll take commercial vendors years to turn that around.

1016
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,260
So Linux has that.

1017
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,960
And you can see it, like, think about it even in the form factors.

1018
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,880
Mr. Wimpey here has a pretty big update for people that have the GPT Pocket.

1019
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,880
Yeah.

1020
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:31,600
So I did some work back in October to make some initial images for the GPT Pocket and

1021
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:36,000
the GPT Pocket 2 for Ubuntu 18.10.

1022
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,760
And since I released those, I had some feedback from people that have got those devices to

1023
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,720
further improve them.

1024
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:52,040
And because 1804.2 has come out now, which shares its hardware enablement stack with

1025
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:58,320
18.10, it meant that everything was in place to create a fresh image based on the LTS now

1026
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,380
because all the requisite hardware support was there.

1027
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:07,280
So I've uplifted those images and then taken some ideas from the community contributors

1028
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,800
to improve them further still.

1029
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,240
So I'm really very happy with them.

1030
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,360
I've got each of those devices, and I have to say it's transformed them.

1031
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,720
I'm really very pleased with them.

1032
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,720
All right.

1033
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,720
Be honest, though.

1034
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,720
How's the performance?

1035
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,840
The GPT Pocket 1 is okay.

1036
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,360
It's fairly decent.

1037
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,280
It's not going to set any world records or anything.

1038
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,280
It's okay.

1039
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,400
The GPT Pocket 2 is actually very good.

1040
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:39,480
It's got the same hardware specs as a MacBook in terms of CPU and RAM and all the rest of

1041
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,480
it.

1042
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:47,560
The eMMC storage is a bit lackluster, but in terms of everything else, it's actually

1043
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,560
very, very usable indeed.

1044
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,240
They're quite nice little devices.

1045
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:56,680
They're what I pack in my bags when we go away at the weekends to visit family because

1046
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:01,500
I've actually got a full boy Linux desktop literally in my pocket.

1047
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,500
With a QWERTY keyboard.

1048
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,500
Yeah, yeah.

1049
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:11,720
It's got a keyboard and a touchpad and touchscreen and HDMI and USB 3 and USB-C. It's got everything

1050
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,880
you need to get stuff done.

1051
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,240
I really like them.

1052
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,120
It's not like the Raspberry Pi where there's tens of millions of these things.

1053
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:24,740
Maybe there's tens of thousands of these in the wild, but they came to prominence because

1054
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:30,000
their initial crowd funder offered Ubuntu and Windows options, and subsequently they've

1055
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:38,480
not offered a Linux operating system by default.

1056
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,720
Since I've made these images, SoftWin, which is the parent company, have been in touch

1057
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:49,760
with me, and they're now supplying me with engineering samples of their upcoming devices.

1058
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:56,080
They now list Ubuntu MATE as a firmware option on their website.

1059
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:01,200
It's a small group of people that would ordinarily be running Windows, and now they have an out-of-box

1060
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:08,060
... You can install any Linux on these devices, but then there's a dozen really quirky tweaks

1061
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:14,440
you have to do to rotate the screen and the touch point resolution on the touchscreen

1062
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,100
and all the rest of it.

1063
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:20,400
Just having them pre-baked so you can just install it and it all just works as you accept

1064
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:26,400
it means that there's a group of potential users out there who are going to have a decent

1065
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,680
introduction to Linux and not think, why is everything rotated 90 degrees, and why does

1066
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,160
audio not work and all that.

1067
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,160
That's amazing.

1068
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,800
Internet strangers have made your device work.

1069
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,460
This is case in point right here.

1070
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:41,680
You see, this is the home turf advantage that Linux has on all of these future form factors

1071
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,720
and platforms.

1072
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,340
There might not be tens of millions of GBD pockets one day, but if there ever were something

1073
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,080
like that to take off, Linux is going to be there.

1074
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,080
It sure would.

1075
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,760
You're making me jealous I don't have one of those, too.

1076
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,520
I think that might be one of the coolest devices.

1077
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,640
I want that with me all the time in my bag.

1078
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,640
Yeah.

1079
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,120
I think that's really cool.

1080
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:02,200
Well, great work, and 1904 as well is on there.

1081
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,200
It's the beta.

1082
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,040
It's the 1904 beta.

1083
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:13,280
When the final images drop, I will have 1904 final images available for those two devices

1084
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,280
as well ready to go.

1085
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,280
I don't know, man.

1086
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,280
I like it.

1087
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,280
I'm getting tempted.

1088
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:23,440
I'll have in the show notes a link to a SlashGear article that also covers reasons to abandon

1089
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,880
Windows for Linux.

1090
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:30,680
What I liked about it is I had a bunch of, oh, yeah, right, that is a thing that is really

1091
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:36,200
nice like software catalogs that are nice and curated and everything's free in there.

1092
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,960
Smooth operating system updates that don't nag you like crazy.

1093
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,720
A highly customizable interface which feels like total freedom when you're a power user

1094
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:49,760
coming from Windows, and of course, less tracking, free updates for life.

1095
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,400
One of the things about Linux and free software that I think could be more and more a selling

1096
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:01,560
point as all of these large tech companies go more and more towards subscription revenue,

1097
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,600
it's only a matter of time.

1098
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,280
Actually, I do think there are subscription options now for Windows, and there's just

1099
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,760
going to be more ways like Office 365 is another subscription.

1100
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,080
Free software is subscription free.

1101
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,120
You get the operating system, and you've got it forever.

1102
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:20,640
But the reason why I'm leaving the article for you to read on your own in the notes is

1103
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,960
because I got a couple of really cool picks.

1104
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,520
I've been reading these articles about the old web disappearing, and we just changed

1105
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:35,120
up our website, totally, finally dark theme, hey, hey, dark theme, and in a way, I was

1106
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,520
kind of like, oh, yeah, but now the old site's gone.

1107
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,520
It's a history.

1108
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,040
So I started thinking about ways to archive web pages because we also have a problem where

1109
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,680
sometimes we're researching something for a story and the website goes away.

1110
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,720
It doesn't happen a lot, but it's happened.

1111
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:56,760
So I was looking for ways to completely archive websites, even ones that have like JavaScript

1112
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,520
in them, and that gets rendered.

1113
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,440
So I was looking for more than your average bear of an archive.

1114
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:08,200
And so I found a couple, and I got a quickie, and then I got a really cool complicated one.

1115
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,720
So the first one is simple.

1116
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,560
It's WK, I don't know what it, HTML to PDF.

1117
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,320
It's a series of scripts.

1118
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,840
Does it do what it says it does?

1119
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,840
Yeah.

1120
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,400
And it creates PDFs from web pages, GPL3.

1121
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,400
It's actually pretty cool.

1122
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,480
It uses YouTube DL and a bunch of other stuff to get all the images and run the JavaScript

1123
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,880
and render it out headless so you don't have to have a browser up.

1124
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,920
It can do it scripted in a cron job, and then it can just jump websites out to PDF.

1125
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,920
Right, yeah.

1126
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,920
I mean, right there, they have kind of an example.

1127
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,680
You could use it to back up a Wiki.

1128
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,340
That would be a perfect thing printed out as documentation.

1129
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:42,160
You can run it entirely headless, and then you just have the PDFs in a folder.

1130
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,680
You wake up, and there's your morning edition.

1131
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,240
I hope that you don't want a bunch of PDFs, but if you do, this seems like a great way

1132
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,240
to get them.

1133
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,200
You can also do it as images, I suppose.

1134
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,200
I don't know.

1135
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,200
A PDF just seems to be the default.

1136
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,200
And yeah, it's using a cute WebKit rendering engine.

1137
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,200
So it's got a real web.

1138
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,200
That's fantastic.

1139
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,200
Yeah.

1140
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,200
It's got a real web render, so that's pretty nice.

1141
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,200
All right.

1142
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,820
But let's say you wanted to go like full pack rat.

1143
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:04,840
Check this thing out.

1144
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,640
This is some super cool free software.

1145
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,500
It's called ArchiveBox.

1146
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:13,320
It's the open source, self-hosted web archive.

1147
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,560
ArchiveBox takes a list of the website URLs you want to archive and creates a local, static,

1148
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,640
browsable HTML clone of the content from those websites.

1149
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:25,640
It saves the HTML, the JavaScript, media files, PDF, images, videos, all of it.

1150
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,640
Videos?

1151
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,640
Yeah.

1152
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,640
It's really cool, Wes.

1153
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,840
You can use it to preserve access to websites you care about, like say you just give it

1154
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,400
your bookmarks file and just have it go archive it all for you.

1155
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,940
Yeah, you know what really stood out to me, though, is it can import and export links

1156
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:41,220
as JSON, and they've explicitly added some stuff to make it easy to hook in with an API.

1157
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,120
So maybe if you want to have some sort of interactive bot or scripting engine that you

1158
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,360
go crawl out and find the stuff you want to archive, hook it into this.

1159
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,760
It's got the rest taken care of.

1160
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,220
That's pretty cool.

1161
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:55,720
And it's a little more capable because it's using Chrome Headless and YouTube DL again.

1162
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,280
Wow.

1163
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,920
I don't think I need this.

1164
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:59,920
Set it up.

1165
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,920
Let it go.

1166
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,380
But a lot of people do really care about archiving the web, and there's some good research

1167
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:04,380
there.

1168
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,840
So it's nice to have tools because sometimes you just need documentation.

1169
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,920
Yeah, it's really easy to do, too.

1170
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,920
It's pretty great.

1171
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,860
So I have links in the show notes in your podcast catcher of choice or Linux unplugged.com

1172
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:14,860
slash 296.

1173
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:15,860
296.

1174
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:20,440
So people have been doing the math and they've been like, hey, guys, you know, like Linux

1175
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,580
Fest like is when episode 300 lands.

1176
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,580
It's just crazy.

1177
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:28,080
I don't know what we're going to do because we won't have as many people in town.

1178
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,920
Because everyone will just just be leaving after the fest.

1179
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,200
Well, and we'll be I'm losing my voice today.

1180
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,120
Maybe I won't even have my voice right.

1181
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,800
And we will we'll be hung over for sure, without a doubt.

1182
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,400
So it's probably going to be a horrible episode, I would imagine.

1183
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,400
Probably one of our worst.

1184
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,360
You know, you know how you could help, though, is come join us live.

1185
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,360
That's true.

1186
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,360
Hey, nice.

1187
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,360
Turn that around, didn't you?

1188
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,960
Yeah, you can get in the mama room and go over to jblive.tv and stream it.

1189
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,320
When we fall asleep, you can make sure there's no dead air.

1190
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,000
We've been using just a super quick thing, then we got to get out of here.

1191
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,500
We've been using Jack the last couple of days on our OBS machine to do inline processing

1192
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:07,960
to add a little compression and the limiter and sort of bring the volume up a little bit

1193
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,920
on our live streams, which were a little low before.

1194
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,920
Yeah.

1195
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,880
So hopefully that's sounding better out there, dear listeners.

1196
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,040
You put it you piped it all together pretty well.

1197
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,880
It's like using compression and stuff inside Jack, right?

1198
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,880
So it's all inline.

1199
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,880
Nothing too fancy.

1200
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,560
And then OBS just has a jack input source.

1201
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,560
So that works.

1202
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,600
No problem.

1203
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,800
So OBS is Jack aware.

1204
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,800
Oh, yeah.

1205
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,800
Jack smart.

1206
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:33,120
Go get more West Tech snap dot systems and that Kota radio I mentioned, but and also

1207
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,120
at Westpain.

1208
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,120
Happy birthday, Mr. Paine.

1209
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,120
Oh, thank you.

1210
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,520
You can go hear more poppy and Mr. Wimpy over at the boon to podcast.

1211
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,440
It's back, baby.

1212
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,440
Great first episode, guys.

1213
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,440
I really enjoyed it.

1214
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,440
It was nice hearing.

1215
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,440
I really like that.

1216
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,440
You just sort of.

1217
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,400
Well, I don't want to give it away, but I like the topic decision you made.

1218
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,400
I know that was probably kind of a hard choice to make potentially because I have a hard

1219
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,480
time doing that.

1220
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,480
But you guys did great.

1221
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,480
I really enjoyed it.

1222
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,480
I won't give it away.

1223
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,480
Go check it out.

1224
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,480
Thank you.

1225
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,480
Welcome back, gentlemen.

1226
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,480
It's nice to have you.

1227
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,480
Thank you.

1228
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,480
Amongst us again.

1229
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,480
Thank you very much.

1230
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,480
And let's see.

1231
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,480
What else?

1232
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,480
Go check out Emma.

1233
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,480
She's at social happiness on the Twitter.

1234
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,480
Nice to have you today, Emma.

1235
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,480
Thank you for making it.

1236
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,480
Thanks for having me.

1237
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,480
And hey, Al.

1238
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,280
Why don't you give give the folks your Twitter handle?

1239
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,280
Maybe they're going to be somewhere where you're at.

1240
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,280
They want to get hold.

1241
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,280
You give them your Twitter handle.

1242
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:21,040
I'm at L underscore O underscore punk at hello punk.

1243
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,040
Hello.

1244
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,040
Oh, really?

1245
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,040
Amazing.

1246
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,640
I never really put that together.

1247
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,240
Bacon, do you have a you have a Twitter over there?

1248
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,240
You tweet.

1249
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1250
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,640
Yeah, that's just cheese bacon.

1251
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,640
All the places.

1252
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,640
Is it C H Z or me?

1253
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:34,640
Right.

1254
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,640
Yeah.

1255
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:36,640
OK.

1256
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,640
You got to get the spelling right.

1257
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,640
Absolutely.

1258
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,640
Well, I mean, it's C H Z.

1259
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,640
B A C U N.

1260
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,640
But nobody has time to actually spell out cheese.

1261
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,640
Like, really?

1262
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,640
Nobody does.

1263
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,640
It's too hip.

1264
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,640
Yeah, it's too hip.

1265
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,640
It's too hip.

1266
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,480
And then last and absolutely least, you know what?

1267
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,240
Let's give let's give a plug for our editor.

1268
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,240
Go check out old dad Joe Rez.

1269
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,240
Joe Rez.

1270
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,240
On the old Twitter.

1271
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,240
Yeah.

1272
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,240
You guys just had your own birthday celebration.

1273
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,240
That's true.

1274
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,240
We just had Land 100.

1275
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,240
Yeah.

1276
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,240
Congratulations.

1277
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,240
It's a great little show.

1278
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,240
Thank you.

1279
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,240
Yeah, we've we've we've had moments where, like, I was almost dying and you stepped in

1280
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,240
for me, you know, but otherwise it's been I mean, I've been there for a lot of them.

1281
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,760
It's the consistent source of all the things you need to start your week.

1282
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,760
Yeah, it's nice.

1283
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,400
It's nice having a team, you know, and one of the things that's cool behind the scenes

1284
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,800
is we've got somebody doing more research full time on that.

1285
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,040
Well, not I mean, that's his full time task.

1286
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,600
So it's it's pretty great.

1287
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,560
We can have more reach, just like you said.

1288
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,560
Yeah, absolutely.

1289
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,560
All right.

1290
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,440
Well, last and absolutely least, I am at Chris LAS.

1291
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,720
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

1292
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,040
There's now Twitter accounts for all the shows, too.

1293
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,680
Which can be handy, like if something big's going on, like if we're doing like a live

1294
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,480
stream of a barbecue grill session.

1295
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,480
So just go give those a follow.

1296
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,680
I think it's at Linux Unplugged.

1297
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,680
That it is.

1298
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,680
Go take it over.

1299
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,680
Go be like one of the first.

1300
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,680
Go own that thing.

1301
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,920
And last but not least, please do join us next Tuesday.

1302
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,040
You can go to Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash calendar to get it converted to your

1303
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,040
local time.

1304
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,520
You can hang out in our IRC room IRC dot Geek Shed dot net pound hashtag.

1305
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,520
Jupiter Broadcasting.

1306
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,120
And of course, that mumble room.

1307
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:03,880
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1308
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:31,760
And I hope to see you right back here, not Monday, next Tuesday!

1309
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:51,000
So while the people vote, I thought in the post show here, we could have a little fun.

1310
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,480
How about a second unboxing?

1311
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,480
Is that ridiculous?

1312
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,480
Isn't that ridiculous?

1313
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,480
Do it.

1314
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,780
So JBtitles dot com.

1315
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,280
Everybody go vote while we do this.

1316
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,280
JBtitles dot com.

1317
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,280
You gotta go vote right now.

1318
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,920
Because we gotta get a good title and then we can get out of here.

1319
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,480
And I really wish you had a video feed because I wanted to see the stickers so bad.

1320
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,480
I know.

1321
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,280
They do look really good, too.

1322
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,760
I'm really happy with how they turned out.

1323
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,840
I think they turned out probably better than I was expecting.

1324
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:15,840
I think.

1325
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,840
I think they probably did.

1326
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,840
All right.

1327
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:23,360
So Mr. West, in front of you right now is something that I ordered just, I believe,

1328
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,360
last week.

1329
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,360
Didn't we talk about this last episode?

1330
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:29,640
Yeah, I ordered the Raspberry Pi keyboard.

1331
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,000
The first Raspberry Pi dedicated keyboard.

1332
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,480
So Mr. Payne, do you have anything to cut the tape?

1333
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,480
I guess we should have thought of that.

1334
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:36,480
Yeah, we should have.

1335
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,480
We need a sharp object.

1336
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,440
The unplanned unboxings are not as smooth.

1337
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,440
I gotta admit.

1338
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,440
Hmm.

1339
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,440
You got anything sharp?

1340
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,440
Yeah.

1341
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:49,360
Mr. Payne, now open the Raspberry Pi box.

1342
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,360
All right.

1343
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:51,400
It feels light, right?

1344
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,400
My first impressions.

1345
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,400
It does feel light.

1346
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:57,160
It's a nice flat matte box with a good Raspberry Pi design on it.

1347
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,160
Bold logo.

1348
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,160
Securely packaged.

1349
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,160
Branding.

1350
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:04,280
It arrived quickly, I gotta admit.

1351
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,280
It comes...

1352
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,280
Do you need me to open that?

1353
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,280
What's going on over there?

1354
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,280
Let me see this thing.

1355
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,280
There's just more tape, I guess.

1356
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,280
Oh, no.

1357
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,280
There's more tape?

1358
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,280
The snare drum player's getting tired.

1359
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,280
I know, right?

1360
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,280
Okay, I almost got it.

1361
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,280
I almost got it.

1362
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,280
You got it.

1363
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,280
I almost got it.

1364
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,280
Here we go.

1365
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,280
Okay, West.

1366
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,280
Here you go.

1367
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,280
Now you can continue.

1368
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,280
Now, what do you think?

1369
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,280
Oh, okay.

1370
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,280
It does feel pretty light.

1371
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,280
Yeah.

1372
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,280
It's handsome.

1373
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,840
Now we are bathed in a red glow, so it's hard to get a real good...

1374
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,360
It does have red trim, though, too.

1375
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,360
It has like a...

1376
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,600
It looks kind of like a sports keyboard.

1377
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,240
Key little red cord to match.

1378
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,240
I'm gonna rip it open.

1379
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,240
I just wanna get at it.

1380
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,280
Did you say it was handsome, West?

1381
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,280
Uh-huh.

1382
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:42,780
Okay, so my first reaction is, is if you're familiar with what the Apple Magic Keyboard,

1383
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:46,800
their external keyboard feels like, that's sort of what the keys feel like, and they're

1384
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:47,800
about that shape.

1385
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,760
But the font is much more readable, much, much larger.

1386
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,600
It's got a nice set of that little hub right on the back there.

1387
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,600
I mean, I don't...

1388
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,360
I mean, this is, of course, gonna be different for everybody, but if you have a little bit

1389
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:01,400
of trouble reading or you're learning how to type, this keyboard could be really nice

1390
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:05,400
because it's very approachable, and the lettering is very, very big.

1391
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,920
It feels very solid.

1392
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:12,060
It's got a little bulge on the back of it where the electronics are, but then it thins

1393
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,840
out towards the space bar on the back of it.

1394
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,280
It's very much like a laptop keyboard, like the way the arrow keys are there.

1395
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,280
How do you feel about that?

1396
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,280
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1397
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,120
Doesn't that kind of feel like a Magic Keyboard a little bit, but a plastic version of it?

1398
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,120
A plastic version, yeah.

1399
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,120
Yeah, lighter.

1400
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,120
Kind of about the...

1401
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,120
A little bit lighter, yeah.

1402
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:30,560
Yeah, that's actually not bad.

1403
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,840
I think for the price, it's actually worth it.

1404
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,840
I think that's actually...

1405
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:33,840
I think I'm pretty happy with that purchase.

1406
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:34,840
It works.

1407
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:35,840
It's working on your machine now?

1408
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:36,840
Yeah.

1409
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,840
Plugged it right in.

1410
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,840
There you go.

1411
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:39,840
I actually...

1412
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,840
I'm gonna say it's a recommend.

1413
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,880
Have you seen where someone's already put a Raspberry Pi Zero in it?

1414
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,880
No.

1415
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,880
Yeah.

1416
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,240
They already tossed like a Pi Zero in it and set it all up.

1417
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,440
So basically, just plug it.

1418
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,440
I love the internet.

1419
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,440
I love the internet.

1420
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:54,720
Plug it, see if you can go to the side of it and go, man.

1421
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,840
That's a great way to play around with Linux.

1422
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:00,120
Jupiter Chainsaw Massacre, even BSD looks good.

1423
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,120
Now we can't give away...

1424
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,080
We can't give away one of the punchlines in the title, guys.

1425
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,080
I mean, I do like that.

1426
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,080
That's a good one, Social Happiness.

1427
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,080
That's a good one.

1428
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,400
But I don't want to give away the title.

1429
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,120
I don't want to give away a punchline in the title.

1430
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,120
Brent, how the hell are you?

1431
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,120
Good, man.

1432
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,120
How is everybody?

1433
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,120
Good.

1434
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,120
Good.

1435
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,120
I saw you sneak in there.

1436
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,120
I didn't get a chance to give you a call out, but I did see you sneak in there and just

1437
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,120
under the cover.

1438
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,380
Yeah, you know, sometimes they're late.

1439
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:19,380
Sometimes they're early.

1440
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:20,380
It's just how it goes.

1441
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:23,320
How are the Linux Fest Northwest plans shaping up?

1442
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:27,620
Oh, you know, I think I may have secured some cat care.

1443
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:30,240
That's number one on the list.

1444
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,520
And then flights are coming in.

1445
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,000
There's a sale going on.

1446
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,080
So, you know, all these things are starting to line up.

1447
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:40,800
There's a lot of moving parts because I got that gig at the same time as some of you know.

1448
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:46,640
So lots and lots of moving parts, including trying to store basically a car full of photography

1449
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,440
gear in a city that I don't exist in.

1450
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,120
So I got to find someone in Toronto to fleet my gear with while the dynamics of the type

1451
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,120
of thing of brand.

1452
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,120
I don't know.

1453
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,120
Is it lifestyle?

1454
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,120
Is that the right way to put it?

1455
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,560
Because it makes it sound like it's something weird.

1456
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,920
But you know, just like I totally know where you're at.

1457
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:07,040
And I completely understand like there's just weird problems that like you don't solve a

1458
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,240
hundred times in a row.

1459
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,360
So it's not like you just have a process like you have to figure it out from scratch to

1460
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:12,360
solve that problem.

1461
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,360
Yeah.

1462
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,400
And the other thing is when you approach people with like potential solutions that you've

1463
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,200
dreamt up for, you know, a week, they always look at you a little funny, like no one's

1464
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:24,200
ever asked me to store, you know, the van full of stuff before.

1465
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,200
That is a lot.

1466
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,200
That's an odd request.

1467
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,200
Yeah.

1468
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:32,800
Speaking of flying, I am so damn jealous of Elle, I just about I just about can't even

1469
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,800
right now.

1470
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:38,200
Elle, you want to tell people, you want to tell people what you did today, what you told

1471
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,200
me today?

1472
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,200
You want to share with the class?

1473
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:45,360
That I booked a flight out of PAE, is that the acronym for it now?

1474
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,360
Yeah, Painfield.

1475
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,840
To San Francisco for DockerCon.

1476
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:48,840
Nice.

1477
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:49,840
Oh, yeah, it's great.

1478
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:50,840
It's great.

1479
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:51,840
Good job.

1480
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:55,280
I don't know how I don't know where she gets off because I'm telling you, I I've lived

1481
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,080
here my whole life.

1482
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:00,960
And finally, they open up a new airport where I don't have to go all the way down to SeaTac

1483
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,680
and now we're drive through the worst part of of traffic.

1484
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,720
It finally opens up after all these after all this flying I've been doing all of this

1485
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,080
driving back and forth to SeaTac.

1486
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,080
You know.

1487
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,080
Oh, yeah.

1488
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,080
You know.

1489
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,080
Oh, man.

1490
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,080
You've suffered.

1491
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,560
She beats to do it.

1492
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,120
She just always does that kind of stuff.

1493
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,120
She's like always leveling.

1494
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,120
She's like leveling up.

1495
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,480
She's like, yeah, yeah, I'm going to give three talks.

1496
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,480
Like what?

1497
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,480
I'm giving one talk.

1498
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,200
You know, I'm going to fly into I'm going to fly out of Painfield.

1499
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,200
What?

1500
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,200
That's awesome.

1501
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,200
Yeah, it's great.

1502
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,120
I mean, y'all could come with me.

1503
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,040
I might actually maybe I'll be your ride.

1504
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:36,120
Maybe I'll give you a ride to the airport and then I can check out the airport.

1505
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,440
Would they let me get I just get a walk around like I don't have to go through security.

1506
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,440
I just want to see it.

1507
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,440
Yeah.

1508
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,680
Like I want to scope out the parking situation so I know next time I travel what it is.

1509
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,080
It's a whole other workflow.

1510
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:50,160
And I want to know like how far how long is it from my five to the actual airport?

1511
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,640
I have no idea.

1512
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,640
Yeah.

1513
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,320
It's it's it's a there's a lot I can use my new official Raspberry Pi keyboard to help

1514
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,320
me find out.

1515
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,320
Look at you go.

1516
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:21,480
Whoo.
