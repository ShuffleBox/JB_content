00:00.000 --> 00:07.840
This is Linux Unplugged, Episode 23 for January 14th, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.480
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's surrendering

00:40.480 --> 00:43.440
to the CES plague right this very second.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.440
My name is Chris.

00:44.440 --> 00:45.440
And my name is Matt.

00:45.440 --> 00:46.440
Hey there, Matt.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.480
We've got a fun episode this week.

00:48.480 --> 00:52.240
Not only has there been some big news in the Linux gadget space that is actually going

00:52.240 --> 00:57.400
to impact our homes, but we've got our first in-studio guest for Linux Unplugged.

00:57.400 --> 01:02.920
It is from Unfilter and GeekGamerTV and Minecraft, me, our very own Mr. Chase Nunes.

01:02.920 --> 01:03.920
Hey there, Chase.

01:03.920 --> 01:04.920
Hey gents.

01:04.920 --> 01:05.920
How are you?

01:05.920 --> 01:06.920
Chase, it's great to have you in studio.

01:06.920 --> 01:07.920
Thank you.

01:07.920 --> 01:08.920
You know what?

01:08.920 --> 01:12.960
For episode 23, by the way, I love the number 23 because I was born on the 23rd of January.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.600
So I got to say, this is kind of like the perfect start, right?

01:15.600 --> 01:16.600
It all comes together.

01:16.600 --> 01:17.600
It is meant to happen.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.280
You were going to join us on Sunday on the big show, Linux action show, but you got the

01:21.280 --> 01:22.280
CES SARS.

01:22.280 --> 01:23.280
Yeah, CES SARS.

01:23.280 --> 01:28.120
It was, I talked to you the night before and then the next morning I woke up, I was like,

01:28.120 --> 01:30.320
oh my God, I cannot do this.

01:30.320 --> 01:34.320
Well, it happens, especially when you go on a big trip and you walk like a million miles

01:34.320 --> 01:37.640
and you talk to like a million people, you end up contracting.

01:37.640 --> 01:41.920
I mean, I went to Linux Fest Northwest and I was sick within a few hours.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.600
We literally thought we're going to have to get a wheelbarrow.

01:43.600 --> 01:44.600
It was bad.

01:44.600 --> 01:45.600
Yeah.

01:45.600 --> 01:48.040
It was funny because I went out to the truck and I'm like, well, man, I'm just going to

01:48.040 --> 01:49.040
go for a lunch break.

01:49.040 --> 01:50.040
I'm going to go out.

01:50.040 --> 01:52.440
And then I leave the building and I immediately start throwing up.

01:52.440 --> 01:56.720
I get like, I'm sorry, by the way, to the Bellingham, I did make it to the toilet thankfully,

01:56.720 --> 01:59.640
but then I get out to my truck and then I'm like, I had like a cup out there.

01:59.640 --> 02:02.240
I was throwing up and now I'm like, man, I don't think I'm going to make it back in.

02:02.240 --> 02:03.240
So I got a great tip.

02:03.240 --> 02:07.620
I got a great tip like, and I didn't follow through on it was to have my own personal

02:07.620 --> 02:11.340
bottle of hand sanitizer and it didn't happen.

02:11.340 --> 02:14.920
And so obviously, by the way, the whole crew is sick.

02:14.920 --> 02:15.920
John is sick.

02:15.920 --> 02:16.920
Joe got sick.

02:16.920 --> 02:21.720
Actually, John is on my couch right now because he's been out of it since Saturday, pretty

02:21.720 --> 02:22.720
much.

02:22.720 --> 02:23.720
Wow.

02:23.720 --> 02:24.720
He really got it.

02:24.720 --> 02:25.720
Yeah.

02:25.720 --> 02:26.720
He really got a hit hard.

02:26.720 --> 02:30.160
So the tip is bring hand sanitizer, hand sanitizer, maybe wear a mask, actually head to the health

02:30.160 --> 02:31.600
and fitness pavilion first.

02:31.600 --> 02:32.600
Oh, they have one?

02:32.600 --> 02:33.600
Yeah, sure.

02:33.600 --> 02:36.840
And then talk to them and say, Hey, what kind of new technologies and innovations do you

02:36.840 --> 02:38.080
have to keep me healthy?

02:38.080 --> 02:40.960
You grab that first, then you hit the rest of the convention.

02:40.960 --> 02:41.960
So you're ready to go.

02:41.960 --> 02:42.960
Wow.

02:42.960 --> 02:43.960
That's good.

02:43.960 --> 02:44.960
Thank you.

02:44.960 --> 02:45.960
Well, I'm feeling educated.

02:45.960 --> 02:46.960
Yeah, I know.

02:46.960 --> 02:47.960
Yeah.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.440
Now I feel like I have a little insider's tip on if we ever go to CS how to handle that.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.600
Go to the health pavilion first.

02:51.600 --> 02:52.600
You have to go.

02:52.600 --> 02:56.520
I mean, it's one of those experiences that, by the way, I believe I was reading a stat

02:56.520 --> 03:00.080
that this year, CS was the largest attended ever.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.080
Really?

03:01.080 --> 03:03.600
Because I heard a ton of people couldn't make it because of the snow and ice storms and

03:03.600 --> 03:04.600
stuff.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.600
Well, a lot of people showed up late.

03:05.600 --> 03:06.600
Oh, yeah, yeah.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.080
But no, it was very, very highly attended.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.080
Oh, that's cool.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.880
Depending on the hall that you were in, of course.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.600
So I want to pick your brain on Linux loving gadgets that you saw and just cool stuff you

03:14.600 --> 03:15.600
saw there.

03:15.600 --> 03:20.240
But as is per tradition here on the Unplugged show, we start with feedback.

03:20.240 --> 03:24.820
We do the email up top because statistically, email is the thing that makes people tune

03:24.820 --> 03:28.120
out the most because it's a little boring for a lot of people who aren't interested

03:28.120 --> 03:29.120
in that topic.

03:29.120 --> 03:32.580
So what I figured to do is we put at the top of the show, that way we spill off as many

03:32.580 --> 03:34.720
people as possible right at the beginning.

03:34.720 --> 03:35.720
Get rid of them.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.780
And we stuck with that format since episode one, so damn it, we're going to continue on.

03:38.780 --> 03:43.280
So Michael wrote in, and Chase, I know you're going to have some opinions on this because

03:43.280 --> 03:45.360
you saw these at the convention center.

03:45.360 --> 03:48.680
I know Matt's got opinions on these, especially in terms of the economics.

03:48.680 --> 03:51.760
Michael wrote and he said, the most exciting feature for Steam Machines, hi Chris and Matt

03:51.760 --> 03:52.820
and Chase.

03:52.820 --> 03:56.400
In my humble opinion, the best feature of the new Steam Machines is that the devices

03:56.400 --> 04:01.640
will still be usable in five to seven years when the current console cycle ends.

04:01.640 --> 04:05.380
It bothers me that companies like Microsoft and PlayStation move away from their old consoles

04:05.380 --> 04:10.120
to the new ones and the leftover hardware is just virtually useless.

04:10.120 --> 04:13.060
The hardware is still decent and could be used to serve a purpose if Linux could be

04:13.060 --> 04:14.480
easily installed on them.

04:14.480 --> 04:18.600
Example, why can't the Xbox 360 be refurbed and set up as a desktop computer for a kid

04:18.600 --> 04:21.400
who's parents can't afford a regular computer?

04:21.400 --> 04:26.800
With Steam Machines, this would not be a problem, as the console is already running Linux.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.960
So once finished with the device as a gaming machine, it could still serve a useful purpose

04:30.960 --> 04:33.120
rather than sitting in the trash heap.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.040
Looking forward to another great show on Sunday, Michael.

04:35.040 --> 04:38.240
What do you think of this, Chase, of you saw these Steam Machines.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.080
I'm going to pick this email apart.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.560
And you have some problems with these.

04:41.560 --> 04:42.560
Yeah.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.480
Okay, so what was your problem with the Steam Machines and tell me your thoughts.

04:44.480 --> 04:47.280
Okay, well first off, can I respond to the email?

04:47.280 --> 04:48.280
Michael?

04:48.280 --> 04:49.280
Yeah.

04:49.280 --> 04:55.080
First off, as a gamer, first and foremost, to say that the old Xbox 360 will be completely

04:55.080 --> 04:59.960
useless since Microsoft and Sony have moved on to the new generation of consoles.

04:59.960 --> 05:00.960
Or PS3.

05:00.960 --> 05:05.680
It is completely unfair because of the fact that, I don't know, there's an entire incredible

05:05.680 --> 05:09.580
library of games alone that need to be played on the 360.

05:09.580 --> 05:10.840
So to say that it's virtually useless-

05:10.840 --> 05:11.840
That's true.

05:11.840 --> 05:12.840
I mean, I still play SNES games.

05:12.840 --> 05:13.840
Yeah.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.560
So to say that it's completely gone, and not only that, there are some incredible apps

05:16.560 --> 05:19.440
that work on the Xbox 360, even Plex works incredibly just fine.

05:19.440 --> 05:20.600
But what about this ability?

05:20.600 --> 05:24.280
What if you could put a DVD in that drive and you could install the desktop Linux distribution,

05:24.280 --> 05:27.560
you could be browsing the web, you could be checking your email and use it, it's got PowerPC

05:27.560 --> 05:28.560
processing in it.

05:28.560 --> 05:29.560
Yeah.

05:29.560 --> 05:30.560
Wouldn't that be nice?

05:30.560 --> 05:31.560
Yeah, it would be nice.

05:31.560 --> 05:32.560
And actually, Sony had that for a long time, remember?

05:32.560 --> 05:33.560
They had the ability-

05:33.560 --> 05:34.560
They pulled it, yeah.

05:34.560 --> 05:35.560
And they pulled it.

05:35.560 --> 05:40.360
So maybe, here's the thing, if they could pull it, maybe they can put it back on, right?

05:40.360 --> 05:45.720
Maybe once the life cycle has completed for the PS3 and it's completely gone, then Sony

05:45.720 --> 05:48.200
goes, all right, well, what we're going to do is we're going to give you guys the ability

05:48.200 --> 05:51.440
to install your own custom OS like we did before.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.640
So that could happen in the future, we don't know.

05:54.640 --> 05:58.720
So we can't say automatically that they're going to cut it off and not make it happen.

05:58.720 --> 06:03.960
The Xbox, the original Xbox, by the way, heavily moddable, you can make your own custom machine.

06:03.960 --> 06:08.600
A lot of people, that's how Xbox Media Center, XBMC got started, remember, the original modded

06:08.600 --> 06:09.600
Xbox.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.860
So you got that.

06:10.860 --> 06:20.320
At CES, we saw loads, about 15 different Steam machines from all major manufacturers, Alienware,

06:20.320 --> 06:22.240
Falcon Northwest.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.960
Beautiful boxes, by the way, very, very well-innovated.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.360
Right, I was pretty impressed by that.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.360
Micro-ITX designs.

06:27.360 --> 06:28.360
They're really trying hard.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.360
They look great.

06:29.360 --> 06:32.160
But here's some of the problems that I foresee happening.

06:32.160 --> 06:35.360
First off, you have a wide price range of boxes.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.360
From 500 to 6,000.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.400
From 500 to $6,000.

06:38.400 --> 06:43.160
Now, obviously, they think that if you're going to buy the low-end, you're going to

06:43.160 --> 06:48.040
be streaming from a higher-end compatible gaming machine that is not really meant for

06:48.040 --> 06:49.040
you to game on.

06:49.040 --> 06:53.720
Now, I don't know about you, Chris, but when I purchased a machine, say a computer, say

06:53.720 --> 07:00.400
five to seven years ago, how honestly usable is it today other than basic web browsing

07:00.400 --> 07:01.860
and email and stuff?

07:01.860 --> 07:04.460
So it's very hard to say.

07:04.460 --> 07:11.240
One of my issues is I don't know where Valve and Steam is going with this because of the

07:11.240 --> 07:16.520
wide price points and the wide variety of what you can get.

07:16.520 --> 07:21.520
They recently interviewed, I believe it was Engadget, they interviewed the CEO of Microsoft's

07:21.520 --> 07:23.960
gaming division and asked him what he thought.

07:23.960 --> 07:28.000
And he goes, well, first off, I know better than go head-to-head against Gabe Newell.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.120
I know that.

07:29.120 --> 07:32.960
But he says, I'm not really too worried because they're not really in our target because of

07:32.960 --> 07:36.080
the wide variety of different platforms.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.720
Well, Matt, let me ask you this.

07:37.720 --> 07:43.020
So do you think if the Steam console, after two, three years of use, can be repurposed

07:43.020 --> 07:46.480
as a desktop computer that could do email and web browsing running a Linux desktop,

07:46.480 --> 07:48.160
does that change the value equation for you?

07:48.160 --> 07:50.840
Because I know you've been critical of the high prices and you think they've got to get

07:50.840 --> 07:53.160
that down to about $300.

07:53.160 --> 07:56.860
Does a $600 Steam box seem more reasonable if two, three years down the road it can also

07:56.860 --> 07:58.720
become a decent desktop?

07:58.720 --> 08:00.400
I think that's delayed value.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.840
I mean, the value is certainly there and there's no question of that.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.600
And you'll certainly be able to get some value out of that.

08:04.600 --> 08:09.080
But I'm not entirely sure that the person that initially dropped $600 in a gaming console

08:09.080 --> 08:14.660
is looking for longevity value coming from a Linux box that's going to be then dated

08:14.660 --> 08:16.180
specs at that point.

08:16.180 --> 08:18.480
You're kind of mixing your apple juice and your orange juice there.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.240
It just doesn't really make any sense.

08:20.240 --> 08:23.520
Someone buys a mid-range box, maybe, but $600, I don't know.

08:23.520 --> 08:27.480
Yeah, I guess people aren't going to look at that as a desktop replacement later on.

08:27.480 --> 08:28.480
Yeah.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.020
Although there's one scenario.

08:30.020 --> 08:31.080
You're fairly affluent.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.080
Things are grooving.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.520
You buy your $600 box.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.520
Then you lose your job.

08:34.520 --> 08:35.840
Everything goes to crap.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.840
And you now are trying to repurpose your existing equipment, Ben, there.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.640
So yeah, absolutely.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.040
Now then I could see it making sense.

08:42.040 --> 08:44.720
And if that's a business model, the way the economy is going, it's certainly possible.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.720
I mean, that could work out for them.

08:45.720 --> 08:46.720
Well, OK.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.720
So I know Chase is critical of the streaming component of it.

08:48.720 --> 08:53.800
But don't you think that the fact that you could buy, so say you get the mid-range, say

08:53.800 --> 08:56.040
you get a $600 Steam machine today.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.800
Well, that would be a low range, actually.

08:57.800 --> 08:58.800
Right.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.000
And maybe it's got, maybe it has discrete graphics in it.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.880
Maybe it's the Iris 5200 Pro.

09:02.880 --> 09:03.880
It's somewhere in that range.

09:03.880 --> 09:04.880
Integrated stuff there.

09:04.880 --> 09:05.880
Yeah.

09:05.880 --> 09:11.560
But if this Steam box, if your primary goal is to play side-scrolling platformers, and

09:11.560 --> 09:14.480
if your goal is to play controller-based games, maybe this isn't a big issue.

09:14.480 --> 09:17.480
Because again, it only has to send a 1080p signal.

09:17.480 --> 09:18.480
That's correct.

09:18.480 --> 09:19.480
It doesn't have to go beyond that, right?

09:19.480 --> 09:20.480
No.

09:20.480 --> 09:21.480
So that lowers it a little bit.

09:21.480 --> 09:24.240
It doesn't have to do a 1440p display.

09:24.240 --> 09:29.440
And then on top of that, this machine continues to be relevant because maybe you buy a Steam

09:29.440 --> 09:32.760
box, a mid-level Steam box for a couple of years, and then after a couple of years you

09:32.760 --> 09:36.280
buy a new desktop PC, and now you use the streaming capability, and all of a sudden

09:36.280 --> 09:38.320
you're playing the latest games again on your Steam box.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.560
You know, there's another problem here.

09:40.560 --> 09:44.880
And it hasn't really been touched on too much, and the chatroom brought it up a little bit,

09:44.880 --> 09:46.960
and then talked about the controller.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.600
The recommended controller, I should say.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.480
And they had a demonstration unit there.

09:51.480 --> 09:52.480
Did you get to try the controller?

09:52.480 --> 09:53.480
Yeah, but...

09:53.480 --> 09:54.480
You did?

09:54.480 --> 09:55.480
Yeah, but...

09:55.480 --> 09:56.480
What did you think?

09:56.480 --> 09:57.480
Here's the thing.

09:57.480 --> 10:04.560
It's a controller, so if I'm playing a first-person shooter, say like Half-Life 2, I believe the

10:04.560 --> 10:10.280
demo was Portal 2, but it's a controller, right?

10:10.280 --> 10:16.520
For us who play first-person shooters, especially on PCs and Linux machines, it's all about

10:16.520 --> 10:18.620
the keyboard and mouse, right?

10:18.620 --> 10:21.360
And so if they came up with a...

10:21.360 --> 10:24.040
And a lot of people said, well, you could just plug in your own keyboard and mouse into

10:24.040 --> 10:25.040
it.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.040
Okay, that's great.

10:26.040 --> 10:30.280
You could have a 10-foot USB cable or a wireless, but then when you have something that's wireless,

10:30.280 --> 10:31.600
it always introduces latency.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.960
Well, let me flip that question around.

10:32.960 --> 10:36.600
If you could plug that into your Xbox One today, wouldn't you?

10:36.600 --> 10:39.760
Well, yes, and actually we saw something like that at the show too.

10:39.760 --> 10:40.760
Okay, all right.

10:40.760 --> 10:41.840
But you see what I'm saying.

10:41.840 --> 10:42.840
You would do it.

10:42.840 --> 10:45.080
You'd be willing to do it, and isn't the option to be able to do it nice?

10:45.080 --> 10:46.080
Yes, and cleanly.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.620
And I think one of the things that's cool about the Steam Box is they're willing to

10:49.620 --> 10:52.680
work with outside innovations like the Oculus Rift.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.560
Valve has been working directly with the Oculus Rift.

10:54.560 --> 10:58.080
It would be cool if the first thing that supports Oculus Rift is Steam Boxes, because it's not

10:58.080 --> 11:01.520
going to be the Xbox One or the PlayStation 4.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.760
They might come up with their own solution mid-product cycle and release it, kind of

11:04.760 --> 11:09.640
like Microsoft released the Kinect towards the end of the Xbox 360's life cycle.

11:09.640 --> 11:13.600
But Valve could be there day one with Oculus Rift support, and that could sell a few Steam

11:13.600 --> 11:14.600
Boxes too.

11:14.600 --> 11:15.600
That would help.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.600
That would help.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.000
I think, like we've talked about before, the prices are too high now, and they're going

11:19.000 --> 11:21.800
to remain too high for about at least a year.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.000
It depends.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.300
This is the weird thing, right?

11:24.300 --> 11:25.840
What is their goal?

11:25.840 --> 11:27.440
What is their target market here?

11:27.440 --> 11:29.560
Are they trying to compete directly with consoles?

11:29.560 --> 11:35.120
Well, if that answer is yes, then they have to compete on price point and features.

11:35.120 --> 11:39.840
But couldn't you have flipped this conversation around ten years ago and said, what is this

11:39.840 --> 11:43.560
gaming company doing making this distribution platform?

11:43.560 --> 11:48.200
They've got a couple of games on there, it's wrapped in this horrible DRM, and what happens

11:48.200 --> 11:49.200
to the used market?

11:49.200 --> 11:53.040
Like, I go down to GameStop today, and I sell my old games, and I buy a new game.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.480
You can't do that with Steam.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.480
This is never going to work.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.000
Well, they were able to do that.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
That was the conversation ten years ago.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.240
Yeah, but they were also able to do that from the beginning, because PC gamers were always

12:01.240 --> 12:05.840
kind of, we were kind of brainwashed in a way of like, once you put your code into the

12:05.840 --> 12:08.920
computer, you can't move it anywhere else, right?

12:08.920 --> 12:12.520
So that happened from the very, very beginning.

12:12.520 --> 12:13.520
Early enough.

12:13.520 --> 12:17.720
And so when Valve came in with their distribution platform and said, hey, we have a way that

12:17.720 --> 12:20.960
you can keep all your games in one place, you can always reinstall them whenever you

12:20.960 --> 12:26.080
want, we're not going to go anywhere, that's why they've been successful with that.

12:26.080 --> 12:29.880
But on the console side, you know, you've never, well, you've never had to, with the

12:29.880 --> 12:33.000
exception of a few games, put in a code to be able to play them.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Yeah, you're starting to see it now, actually.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.920
Well, EA, EA said, well, we're not going to do that anymore.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.400
They actually said we're getting rid of the codes for online play.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.400
Oh, good.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.000
Like, for example, if you bought the newest, I know you're a football fan, Chris.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.480
Yeah, I like the sports ball, too.

12:46.480 --> 12:49.000
Actually, if I'm ever going to watch football, it's going to be this weekend.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Yeah.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
The games could be incredible.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Yeah, I know.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Let's say you bought Madden.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.480
Well, the only way you could play Madden online is by entering the code that came with the

12:56.480 --> 12:59.040
game, and EA is doing that to prevent resale.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.040
Yeah.

13:00.040 --> 13:03.200
So let's say you went and bought that game used, you would have to buy a new code from

13:03.200 --> 13:04.200
EA to play that online.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.200
Which is just crap.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.000
But they said they're going to discontinue that practice.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Oh, how nice of them.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Yeah, isn't that nice?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Thank you, EA.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Well, Michael, good email, and thank you for saying that to the show.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Yeah, totally.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.840
And it's going to be definitely a watch and see thing, because there's, you know, and

13:16.840 --> 13:19.040
then that's not even getting into the ecosystem or the marketing.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.040
Right.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.040
Well, will I buy one?

13:21.040 --> 13:22.040
Yeah.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.040
Oh, yeah.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.040
Probably for sure.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.040
Or build one.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.040
Yeah, or build one.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.040
And that's the best part, right?

13:27.040 --> 13:28.040
Yeah, it is.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.040
You can build your own and then have that back end ready for you.

13:29.040 --> 13:32.400
Well, and see, this is, like Gabe said himself, he's not too worried about their 63 million

13:32.400 --> 13:37.080
or whatever it was, Steam users, it's bigger than PS4s or the Xbox online.

13:37.080 --> 13:41.260
And to be honest with you, if they could just sell to a few small percentages of that existing

13:41.260 --> 13:47.440
market, who are just radically passionate about Steam and want to hook up a Steam box

13:47.440 --> 13:50.440
to their TV to just to get a very trouble-free gaming experience.

13:50.440 --> 13:53.600
I floated this idea on last, I kind of came up with it on the spot, and I was wondering

13:53.600 --> 13:54.600
what you thought about it.

13:54.600 --> 14:00.320
I think Mac users could be the perfect target for Steam boxes, because they hate Windows,

14:00.320 --> 14:03.880
they don't want to futz with a PC, they don't even want to bother with Bootcamp because

14:03.880 --> 14:07.560
they literally hate Windows, a lot like some of us Linux users do.

14:07.560 --> 14:11.440
And so why not avoid all of the Windows hassles and just buy a Steam box appliance, that way

14:11.440 --> 14:14.440
you get your PC games and you still get to have your pretty Mac.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.720
Well, wait a minute, what if I just bought a Mac Mini?

14:17.720 --> 14:18.920
I mean, what's the difference there then?

14:18.920 --> 14:19.920
Put Steam OS on that panel.

14:19.920 --> 14:20.920
Right, exactly.

14:20.920 --> 14:21.920
Well, I just buy a Mac Mini, right?

14:21.920 --> 14:22.920
Yeah, you could.

14:22.920 --> 14:23.920
You could dual boot it, I suppose, or something like that.

14:23.920 --> 14:27.360
I'm just saying, I think there is a market, but I think initially that market is going

14:27.360 --> 14:30.080
to be people who are willing to pay that premium price, and that's really my point.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.080
Right.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.080
No, absolutely.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.880
And then once we're through that phase, we're really going to see what Valve's end game

14:33.880 --> 14:34.880
is.

14:34.880 --> 14:35.880
Yeah, no, totally.

14:35.880 --> 14:36.880
All right.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.440
Well, Jay wrote in, and I think we'll bounce this one around for a little bit.

14:39.440 --> 14:42.240
He says, Gnome still has a lot of an uphill battle ahead of it.

14:42.240 --> 14:46.120
In your recent Gnome 3 defense episode, you mentioned a theory that people that are adverse

14:46.120 --> 14:49.160
to Gnome 3's changes are those that resist change in general.

14:49.160 --> 14:50.760
This isn't true for everyone.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.840
Some have valid complaints, others just complain because they can.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.560
Personally, I'm someone that loves change.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.560
In fact, I crave it.

14:57.560 --> 15:01.220
But Gnome 3's changes are just plain bad.

15:01.220 --> 15:03.240
And I think that's the first problem with Gnome 3.

15:03.240 --> 15:07.960
Tweak tools and extensions should not be required in order to make this experience usable.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.040
Now, Matt, I think you probably agree with that, right?

15:10.040 --> 15:12.600
I would agree with the fact that I think they should include them.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.320
I don't have a problem with them existing.

15:14.320 --> 15:17.520
I just think the fact that they're not provided by default doesn't make any sense to me.

15:17.520 --> 15:20.040
Yeah, especially the really popular ones.

15:20.040 --> 15:23.600
And of course, desktop environments continue to have the fanboyism.

15:23.600 --> 15:27.720
As soon as you say anything about X, Y, Z, desktop environment, they come out of the

15:27.720 --> 15:28.720
woodwork.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.720
And that's just an expected thing.

15:29.720 --> 15:30.720
It's kind of sad.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.120
But it is what it is.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.280
I kind of agree with them, though.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.800
I think it's got a lot of growing pains from growing room.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.320
It's going to have to kind of find its way.

15:38.320 --> 15:39.320
I don't know.

15:39.320 --> 15:42.360
I think that it's almost as if developers are saying, yes, we know the default user

15:42.360 --> 15:43.520
experience is bad.

15:43.520 --> 15:46.600
But that's OK, because we have a tweak tool and extensions.

15:46.600 --> 15:50.040
It's easy for the Gnome developers to not be concerned with backlash when they're basically

15:50.040 --> 15:55.160
telling their users to install extensions and fix the problem themselves.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.760
And I, of course, go back to the, if you don't like it, don't use it.

15:57.760 --> 16:00.000
I mean, at the end of the day, that's kind of my big thing.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
It's like, I don't necessarily care for Gnome 3.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.280
But rather than becoming emotionally invested in it, I'll revisit it later and see if I've

16:07.280 --> 16:09.080
become more interested in it at that point.

16:09.080 --> 16:13.440
But I don't see a lot of value in going off about it, because it's just like, yeah, it's

16:13.440 --> 16:14.440
not for everybody.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.440
I think they do a lot of things right.

16:15.440 --> 16:16.720
I like the unification idea.

16:16.720 --> 16:17.720
I think that's very cool.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.520
It's something to watch.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.800
But it's not quite there yet.

16:20.800 --> 16:21.800
That's OK.

16:21.800 --> 16:22.800
But why rip on it?

16:22.800 --> 16:23.800
That's my big thing.

16:23.800 --> 16:29.320
We got an email from a guy who's been using Gnome 3 on his Archbase Touch laptop.

16:29.320 --> 16:32.700
And he says that it works OK, but there's still a few areas that it seems like the code

16:32.700 --> 16:33.760
just hasn't been hooked up yet.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.360
The Plum is not quite done yet.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.360
Sure.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.400
He says, he went on to say, anyways, awesome show.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.440
And I hope Gnome gets their act together.

16:40.440 --> 16:41.440
They have a long way to go.

16:41.440 --> 16:44.600
He says, he predicts that someday Gnome will probably be completely awesome.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.920
By that time, it happens, though.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.280
I wonder if they'll have any user base left.

16:47.280 --> 16:52.120
You know, I've been using Gnome 3 since our episode in defense of Gnome 3.

16:52.120 --> 16:58.360
And what I've decided to teach myself is every couple of days, I learn a new keyboard shortcut.

16:58.360 --> 17:02.560
And now I've got windows down where I can snap them to the different edges of the screen

17:02.560 --> 17:03.560
with the keyboard.

17:03.560 --> 17:04.640
I can move them between workspaces.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.880
And then somebody else, and I'm sorry I forget their name right now, but somebody in our

17:06.880 --> 17:11.360
community said, Chris, think of the activities as, any time you start something a little

17:11.360 --> 17:14.680
bit different, do it in a new virtual desktop, because you can create them and destroy them

17:14.680 --> 17:15.800
on will.

17:15.800 --> 17:20.960
So what I have done is if I open up a new tab, sometimes I'll think, well, maybe this

17:20.960 --> 17:23.080
is actually better to be done in a new workspace.

17:23.080 --> 17:24.080
And I'll move it to a new workspace.

17:24.080 --> 17:25.960
And I've been working that way.

17:25.960 --> 17:29.480
So I've been trying to get Gnome 3 down towards muscle memory so I can then really say, OK,

17:29.480 --> 17:32.720
if I retrain myself to do the Gnome way of things, is it usable?

17:32.720 --> 17:36.280
And the things like super key M and it shows the notifications and stuff like that, I'm

17:36.280 --> 17:38.120
actually really starting to dig it.

17:38.120 --> 17:42.560
But it does require that you change the way you use it a little bit and you kind of learn

17:42.560 --> 17:43.560
its new way.

17:43.560 --> 17:47.640
But I am trying to find out that if I totally subscribe to their philosophy, do I become

17:47.640 --> 17:48.720
more efficient?

17:48.720 --> 17:51.400
But it's one of those things that just takes weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks

17:51.400 --> 17:52.400
of usage.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.400
Yes, it does.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.600
That is where I'm at right now.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.600
All right.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.800
Well, before we move on, we had a great post in the subreddit.

17:59.800 --> 18:06.160
And it came from Shimmy C. And he says, DigitalOcean posted droplet distro usage

18:06.160 --> 18:07.160
stats.

18:07.160 --> 18:10.000
It's pretty much exactly what you would expect.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.160
And we were talking last week on Linux Unplugged with Mr. Popey in the mumble room.

18:15.160 --> 18:22.040
And we were talking about how CentOS and Red Hat had merged and how right now the stranglehold

18:22.040 --> 18:23.040
that...

18:23.040 --> 18:24.040
Oh, dang it.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.040
I changed that.

18:25.040 --> 18:28.280
The stranglehold that Ubuntu has on cloud providers is strong.

18:28.280 --> 18:31.200
Maybe that's one of the reasons Red Hat wanted to work closer with CentOS.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.920
Well, DigitalOcean posted their droplet stats.

18:34.920 --> 18:39.760
Ubuntu has 66% of active droplets on DigitalOcean.

18:39.760 --> 18:48.040
Debian has 12%, CentOS has 18%, and Arch is coming in at a mighty 1.34%, only to beat

18:48.040 --> 18:50.080
out Fedora at 0.81%.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.080
Wow.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.080
So there you go.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.640
Ubuntu rocking 66% of the DigitalOcean droplets.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.440
A lot of that is direct LAMP stack.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.280
Sometimes it's WordPress deployments.

18:59.280 --> 19:06.440
Docker, actually since this is the first year of Docker, a respectable 1.74% of deployments

19:06.440 --> 19:07.440
use Docker.

19:07.440 --> 19:08.640
Now what is DigitalOcean?

19:08.640 --> 19:12.880
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

19:12.880 --> 19:15.240
easy way to spin up a cloud server.

19:15.240 --> 19:18.640
Users can get started with a DigitalOcean droplet as in little as 55 seconds.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.840
Now I'll make a personal challenge to you, dear listener.

19:21.840 --> 19:24.440
I was able to do it in 44 seconds.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.440
That's right.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.580
I'm dropping the gauntlet right here on the Linux Unplugged show.

19:27.580 --> 19:28.840
Can you do it faster?

19:28.840 --> 19:32.840
Perhaps go over to DigitalOcean and find out, and while you're over there, take advantage

19:32.840 --> 19:36.200
of our brand new promo code, Linux Unplugged January.

19:36.200 --> 19:40.560
That's going to get you a $10 DigitalOcean credit, and if you use the $5 rig like I've

19:40.560 --> 19:43.280
been using, that's going to get you two months of the DigitalOcean service.

19:43.280 --> 19:47.360
They have a super intuitive interface with any power users can even replicate on a larger

19:47.360 --> 19:48.840
scale with their straightforward API.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.440
Chris, I'm confused here.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.640
I know I'm a noob in this arena.

19:52.640 --> 19:56.320
What does DigitalOcean do?

19:56.320 --> 19:59.700
If you wanted to go over to DigitalOcean's site, you could spin up a full-fledged server

19:59.700 --> 20:03.320
in under a minute, and you could have an Ubuntu rig.

20:03.320 --> 20:08.560
You were recently playing around with Airtime, which we got going finally, and it's really

20:08.560 --> 20:10.600
easy to get them running on Ubuntu.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.600
Did you do it on CentOS?

20:11.600 --> 20:12.600
No, no.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.600
We had to go to Ubuntu.

20:13.600 --> 20:14.800
We couldn't do it on Cent.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.460
For example, you could go over to DigitalOcean.

20:16.460 --> 20:17.460
You could log in.

20:17.460 --> 20:20.200
If you use our promo code, Linux Unplugged January, you'll get two months of DigitalOcean

20:20.200 --> 20:21.780
for free with a $10 credit.

20:21.780 --> 20:26.520
That gets you 512 megs of RAM, a 20-gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer,

20:26.520 --> 20:29.400
which is great for an audio streaming rig.

20:29.400 --> 20:33.800
You could deploy it immediately from the get-go with Ubuntu 13.10 ready to go, and then you

20:33.800 --> 20:37.400
could get Airtime installed and get everything configured just the way you want it, and then

20:37.400 --> 20:41.720
you can save that droplet and then deploy it later, like next time if you want to deploy

20:41.720 --> 20:44.160
a secondary stream server to do a lower bit rate.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.160
Wow.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.160
Yeah, it's really simple.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.160
Where are they located?

20:47.160 --> 20:51.300
Well, Chase, I'm glad you asked because DigitalOcean has data centers located in New York, San

20:51.300 --> 20:53.320
Francisco, and Amsterdam.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.840
This wasn't planned, by the way.

20:54.840 --> 20:55.840
I'm honestly inquiring.

20:55.840 --> 21:01.240
Well, actually, I don't know if you knew this, but so for the Unfilter show, I distribute

21:01.240 --> 21:05.960
the supporter show via BitTorrent Sync, and I host it here at my house on the FiOS connection,

21:05.960 --> 21:07.120
which is a 50-50 connection.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.120
It's pretty good.

21:08.120 --> 21:12.560
And then, because I'm on the West Coast, I have a DigitalOcean VPS on the East Coast

21:12.560 --> 21:16.800
that has a copy of the BitTorrent Sync so that way folks can get seeding it from both

21:16.800 --> 21:21.120
sides of the United States, and it really helps with performance, and it's really straightforward.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.120
But guess what?

21:22.120 --> 21:25.080
This is so freaking awesome.

21:25.080 --> 21:28.700
DigitalOcean is really excited because they have a contest going on right now.

21:28.700 --> 21:33.080
They're giving away $10,000 in free hosting credits to the user that spins up the millionth

21:33.080 --> 21:34.080
droplet.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.080
That's right.

21:35.080 --> 21:41.560
You get $10,000 of DigitalOcean hosting credits if you spin up the millionth droplet.

21:41.560 --> 21:42.560
Now, look at this.

21:42.560 --> 21:46.400
Right now, 983 million is at their end change.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.040
So they're really, really close, you guys.

21:48.040 --> 21:52.920
So go over to DigitalOcean.com, use our brand new promo code, Linux Unplugged January, get

21:52.920 --> 21:56.680
the $10 credit, and maybe, just maybe, you can spin up the millionth droplet and get

21:56.680 --> 21:57.680
$10,000.

21:57.680 --> 21:58.680
Wow.

21:58.680 --> 21:59.680
Wow.

21:59.680 --> 22:00.680
That's pretty incredible.

22:00.680 --> 22:01.680
Pretty cool.

22:01.680 --> 22:02.680
Yeah.

22:02.680 --> 22:03.680
You know what, Chase?

22:03.680 --> 22:04.680
That does deserve a ding.

22:04.680 --> 22:05.680
Stand by.

22:05.680 --> 22:06.680
There you go.

22:06.680 --> 22:07.680
So go check it out.

22:07.680 --> 22:15.480
Go over to DigitalOcean.com, and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

22:15.480 --> 22:18.280
Ever since I put my BitTorrent sync over there, it's just boom.

22:18.280 --> 22:21.480
People are downloading the show, and it absolutely saturates their connection.

22:21.480 --> 22:22.480
That is awesome.

22:22.480 --> 22:23.480
Yeah.

22:23.480 --> 22:24.480
It really makes the shipping of files super quick.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.480
Okay.

22:25.480 --> 22:26.480
All right, guys.

22:26.480 --> 22:30.120
Well, there's a lot of things to talk about, but Chase, before we get into some of the

22:30.120 --> 22:33.760
other topics I had on the agenda, now that we've got you here in studio, I just wanted

22:33.760 --> 22:38.520
to pick your brain on what was, if you could just narrow it down to, is it possible?

22:38.520 --> 22:43.120
Is there one thing that you really thought was just amazing at CES, or one theme?

22:43.120 --> 22:44.120
Well, well.

22:44.120 --> 22:45.120
Was it wearables?

22:45.120 --> 22:46.120
Let's be honest.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.120
Wearables was there.

22:47.120 --> 22:53.760
4K TV Ultra High Def was everywhere, especially in the north and central halls where you had

22:53.760 --> 22:57.760
all the manufacturer, Sharp, LG, Sony.

22:57.760 --> 23:02.920
NVIDIA had a big booth, too, showing off their Tegra technologies inside cars.

23:02.920 --> 23:09.040
Obviously, they had a demo set up in the parking lot where BMW had their electric cars running

23:09.040 --> 23:11.800
on NVIDIA with the front patch.

23:11.800 --> 23:12.800
It's incredible stuff.

23:12.800 --> 23:17.560
Was anybody dropping the Linux name or BOM, or did you see any TUX logos anywhere?

23:17.560 --> 23:23.520
Didn't see any TUX logos anywhere, but Linux was obviously the underlying operating system

23:23.520 --> 23:24.520
on a lot of platforms.

23:24.520 --> 23:31.560
I mean, you could see it with the Sharps and the LGs and stuff where they have their customized

23:31.560 --> 23:32.560
overlays with-

23:32.560 --> 23:34.480
Yeah, like LG was actually running webOS.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.360
Yes, yes, and we saw that.

23:36.360 --> 23:37.600
What did you think?

23:37.600 --> 23:38.600
You know what?

23:38.600 --> 23:42.440
For such a, I call it beta right now, obviously it's not out there in full-frame, but it was

23:42.440 --> 23:46.440
very, very smooth and it worked very, very well.

23:46.440 --> 23:52.440
One of the things I hate about all TVs that have these built-in interfaces, it feels sluggish.

23:52.440 --> 23:56.840
It's like, I'm waiting, I'm waiting, and then it finally kicks in and it's like the overlays

23:56.840 --> 23:58.680
are not as smooth.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.400
This looked very, very good.

24:00.400 --> 24:04.560
Well, one of the things I've heard is a nightmare with these smart TVs is every smart TV, even

24:04.560 --> 24:09.880
like the different models have their own SDK and they're super complex to write for, but

24:09.880 --> 24:14.040
if you had webOS with HTML5 and that kind of stuff.

24:14.040 --> 24:17.000
Did you happen to see any of the TVs that run in Firefox OS?

24:17.000 --> 24:19.080
No, I didn't see one.

24:19.080 --> 24:21.160
I'm really curious how that works out.

24:21.160 --> 24:26.680
I guess, so these LGs with webOS were the ones that would only, these were the TVs that

24:26.680 --> 24:29.480
Netflix said will support 4K streaming.

24:29.480 --> 24:36.400
So here we have, once again, Netflix doing 4K streaming to a Linux box, webOS is a Linux

24:36.400 --> 24:41.280
based OS, meanwhile, it's Linux users out in the cold, got to hack Silverlight together

24:41.280 --> 24:44.720
in order to watch Netflix, but they're using Linux.

24:44.720 --> 24:49.920
They're using it, but they're, oh, come on, I mean, they got to pay for a house of cards,

24:49.920 --> 24:50.920
right?

24:50.920 --> 24:51.920
They got to pay for it somehow.

24:51.920 --> 24:54.840
They got big money, they got to pay Kevin Spacey too.

24:54.840 --> 24:56.640
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

24:56.640 --> 25:01.080
I'm going to bring in the Mumba room here in case they have any questions about CES,

25:01.080 --> 25:03.080
but I just, you know, I was curious, what did you think?

25:03.080 --> 25:05.720
But there were definitely some items at CES.

25:05.720 --> 25:11.320
We were talking about this in the pre-show, a company by the name of Ativitas makes a

25:11.320 --> 25:17.240
handheld, a customizable controller, and it's for PC and Linux.

25:17.240 --> 25:21.400
By the way, you know, Chris was telling me, hey, we're going to bring you on the Linux

25:21.400 --> 25:23.000
action show.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.920
Part of the thing in the back of my head was look for, you know, Linux items as well to

25:25.920 --> 25:28.440
bring back for the show.

25:28.440 --> 25:35.640
And not only we saw this company, they make something called the Sinister and it's a great

25:35.640 --> 25:36.640
thing.

25:36.640 --> 25:40.400
And for those who are watching the video feed, basically it's a handheld controller.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.580
It's fully customizable.

25:42.580 --> 25:47.120
You can extend it out, but also has these little modules with buttons on them, joysticks

25:47.120 --> 25:50.960
or whatever, and they're literally plug and play and you can do it while it's plugged

25:50.960 --> 25:51.960
into the system.

25:51.960 --> 25:56.480
So this is a USB controller, does this replace the keyboard or what does this do exactly?

25:56.480 --> 25:57.800
Yeah, basically it does.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.760
So you plug your mouse into this.

25:59.760 --> 26:04.440
So there is a USB port so you can use your favorite USB mouse.

26:04.440 --> 26:06.080
And then this is a handheld control.

26:06.080 --> 26:10.600
So remember a Logitech made a couple of years ago, I think it's like the G19 or G58, you

26:10.600 --> 26:12.160
know, one of those monikers.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.160
With all the keys.

26:13.160 --> 26:14.160
With all the keys.

26:14.160 --> 26:19.000
Well, take that, add haptic feedback to it, which is very, very cool.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.720
So you feel the pulsation of every single bullet that you fire, but then you could also

26:23.720 --> 26:28.040
move the modules around on the fly and like, all right, I need to pull out this button

26:28.040 --> 26:31.360
controller module and put in a joystick module and just pop it in.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.360
Oh, yeah.

26:32.360 --> 26:35.120
Set that up with the Oculus Rift.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.800
Oh, now wouldn't that be a good combo?

26:37.800 --> 26:42.880
So right now, as you can see by the picture, these parts have been 3D printed.

26:42.880 --> 26:43.880
What?

26:43.880 --> 26:46.160
Yeah, so they're still working on this right now.

26:46.160 --> 26:47.520
This is a very early days.

26:47.520 --> 26:48.520
This is Alpha.

26:48.520 --> 26:51.600
They told me they are six months out.

26:51.600 --> 26:53.940
They are six months out.

26:53.940 --> 26:57.600
Basically these are held in place by magnets and it works.

26:57.600 --> 27:02.560
I was actually playing some Call of Duty, so I had one of their mice and I was using

27:02.560 --> 27:08.080
that and we moved some modules around while I was playing and it worked seamlessly.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.440
And while you were there, they specifically stated Linux support?

27:10.440 --> 27:11.440
Yeah, they did.

27:11.440 --> 27:14.280
And actually, I believe they stated on their website too, PC and Linux.

27:14.280 --> 27:16.080
They specifically say that.

27:16.080 --> 27:19.360
This is interesting because I don't know if it would replace the keyboard for me, but

27:19.360 --> 27:20.360
I don't know.

27:20.360 --> 27:21.360
I wonder if I could have...

27:21.360 --> 27:23.000
I mean, you can see the thumb.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.160
He's also got buttons here.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.160
There's all their images.

27:25.160 --> 27:27.400
Let me scroll through.

27:27.400 --> 27:30.560
But as you can see, here's another better image.

27:30.560 --> 27:31.800
Here on his...

27:31.800 --> 27:35.000
He moved the little thumb stick module that was here.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
He moved it here.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Interesting.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.520
So he had a little bit of a look button.

27:39.520 --> 27:43.640
So yeah, this is one of those pieces of technology that they don't even have a price point for

27:43.640 --> 27:46.800
yet, but you can fully customize the length of it.

27:46.800 --> 27:50.080
You plug your mouse into it and it works great.

27:50.080 --> 27:54.280
I'm really fascinated by these alternative inputs for the computer because it feels like

27:54.280 --> 28:00.480
the keyboard and mouse, awesome as it is, is very old school.

28:00.480 --> 28:05.000
And there has to be a more efficient way to almost more instinctively and organically

28:05.000 --> 28:07.720
interact with these computers because I feel like the only thing now at this point, I know

28:07.720 --> 28:08.720
this sounds stupid.

28:08.720 --> 28:09.720
There's a good picture there.

28:09.720 --> 28:10.720
That is a really good picture.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.360
You can see that as more of a controller there.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.800
I feel like right now, I was playing very briefly.

28:14.800 --> 28:17.200
Do you remember when we went to PAX, I picked up that pedal switch?

28:17.200 --> 28:18.200
Yeah.

28:18.200 --> 28:19.200
Oh yeah.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.200
What was it though?

28:20.200 --> 28:21.200
The stinky foot.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.200
Yeah, the stinky foot.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.200
Yeah.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.200
And for a brief period in time, I was using that.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.000
I would drop my foot on that.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.640
It would drop down a terminal screen for me and I could type in the terminal and I'd tap

28:29.640 --> 28:32.480
it again and it would bring the terminal back up and it would slide up and down on my screen.

28:32.480 --> 28:33.480
Yeah.

28:33.480 --> 28:34.680
That was awesome for about two days.

28:34.680 --> 28:38.160
And then I did the show, I talked about it and I left it out in the studio and I didn't

28:38.160 --> 28:40.680
bring it back to my desk and I never hooked it up again.

28:40.680 --> 28:45.680
Oh, I thought you were going to say you got some sort of repetitive foot injury from using

28:45.680 --> 28:46.680
it so many times.

28:46.680 --> 28:47.680
No.

28:47.680 --> 28:48.680
No.

28:48.680 --> 28:51.680
I mean, my foot was fine, but it was neat to interact with the computer in a different

28:51.680 --> 28:52.680
way.

28:52.680 --> 28:55.320
I mean, at the end of the day, it's like, well, I can't have this at every computer

28:55.320 --> 28:56.320
I use, right?

28:56.320 --> 28:57.320
Yeah.

28:57.320 --> 29:01.000
And this is a problem I see with a lot of this stuff is where voice and hand gestures

29:01.000 --> 29:05.520
and movements eventually could be integrated into every computer that has the appropriate

29:05.520 --> 29:06.520
sensors.

29:06.520 --> 29:10.080
These types of controllers are going to require that every computer you sit down at has this

29:10.080 --> 29:12.240
device connected to it and I just don't see that happening.

29:12.240 --> 29:13.240
Yeah.

29:13.240 --> 29:14.240
Yeah.

29:14.240 --> 29:18.440
No, it's one of those situations where, as we're seeing it with the Oculus, right, is

29:18.440 --> 29:23.160
the different ways to interact, different input devices, but it's still encouraging

29:23.160 --> 29:25.280
to see that you have a company.

29:25.280 --> 29:27.800
Now, I don't think I touched on it enough.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.680
This device also has haptic feedback.

29:30.680 --> 29:36.000
So you could be playing a game or doing something where you fire upon something and you feel

29:36.000 --> 29:40.120
feedback in your fingertips depending on what you're shooting at.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.120
That's cool.

29:41.120 --> 29:42.120
Yeah.

29:42.120 --> 29:43.120
That is pretty cool for gaming.

29:43.120 --> 29:46.680
Yeah, but also you could use it for other purposes, I guess.

29:46.680 --> 29:50.480
I wonder if there's some way accessibility-wise, like if there was a way to provide feedback

29:50.480 --> 29:51.760
to maybe a blind user.

29:51.760 --> 29:52.760
Yeah.

29:52.760 --> 29:53.760
I could see that for sure.

29:53.760 --> 29:54.760
That could be pretty cool.

29:54.760 --> 29:55.760
Yeah.

29:55.760 --> 29:56.760
Like they know that they're in the sentence or they're typing.

29:56.760 --> 29:57.760
I'm not sure.

29:57.760 --> 30:02.560
I don't use much accessibility stuff, but no, it's one of the most interesting things

30:02.560 --> 30:03.760
I saw.

30:03.760 --> 30:08.120
Another thing which I don't have any pictures of, I have to post the interview up still,

30:08.120 --> 30:16.880
but there's a company that was basically creating a new controller that will supposedly work

30:16.880 --> 30:20.640
on PC, Linux, and also next-gen consoles.

30:20.640 --> 30:21.640
Another controller?

30:21.640 --> 30:22.640
Yeah.

30:22.640 --> 30:30.160
But this particular interface is essentially based upon ultrasonic waves and sound.

30:30.160 --> 30:31.160
What?

30:31.160 --> 30:32.160
What?

30:32.160 --> 30:33.160
They were talked away.

30:33.160 --> 30:34.160
No one covered this.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.160
No one found it.

30:35.160 --> 30:36.160
I haven't heard of this at all.

30:36.160 --> 30:39.840
But basically, you know how the Kinect works, right?

30:39.840 --> 30:40.840
Or the-

30:40.840 --> 30:41.840
Cameras and infrared and whatnot.

30:41.840 --> 30:42.840
Cameras and infrared and stuff.

30:42.840 --> 30:46.200
Well, this is using ultrasonic waves, so it pings back and forth between you-

30:46.200 --> 30:47.200
Like a submarine?

30:47.200 --> 30:48.200
Essentially.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.840
One ping only.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.080
One ping only, for silly.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.040
One ping only.

30:53.040 --> 30:58.960
So the controller, there's these sensors that are placed on top of the TV and on the sides

30:58.960 --> 31:05.040
of the TV, and it knows, based upon proximity to those sensors, how close or far away that

31:05.040 --> 31:06.040
controller is.

31:06.040 --> 31:09.400
So if you're making an aiming motion or a shooting motion-

31:09.400 --> 31:11.280
Like if I'm holding a gun sideways like a gangster?

31:11.280 --> 31:13.120
It knows that you're holding it sideways-

31:13.120 --> 31:14.120
And I'm a gangster.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.120
And that you're a gangster.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.120
Yeah.

31:16.120 --> 31:19.160
And it knows it within one one-hundredth-thousandth of an inch.

31:19.160 --> 31:20.160
Wow!

31:20.160 --> 31:21.440
That's way better than I would know it.

31:21.440 --> 31:22.440
Right.

31:22.440 --> 31:25.520
So part of the problem, I guess, and they explained it to me in the interview, a lot

31:25.520 --> 31:29.740
of it's over my head right now, but they explained to me that the problem with Kinect and these

31:29.740 --> 31:35.000
other services, it doesn't have, it's not very good at depth perception, per se.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
Oh, interesting.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
It's not very accurate.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.280
While it can emulate and knows that your arm's going up and down, it doesn't know necessarily

31:40.280 --> 31:45.920
that you're, let's say if I move my hand from one foot behind to one foot forward, it doesn't

31:45.920 --> 31:50.200
necessarily know that I've moved my hand one foot forward.

31:50.200 --> 31:54.240
So with the ultrasonic, it actually is, you know, it knows that all the time between my

31:54.240 --> 31:58.500
hand being here and here has changed, it can emulate that onto the screen.

31:58.500 --> 32:03.580
So you have just told Matt and I in the mumble room about two different types of interface

32:03.580 --> 32:06.280
devices, not even counting Oculus Rift, but let's throw that in there.

32:06.280 --> 32:10.440
So three different types of brand new ways to interact with your computer.

32:10.440 --> 32:15.640
And I can't help thinking all of these, you'd, you could see working on the steam box before

32:15.640 --> 32:17.200
you see them working anywhere else.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.200
That's true.

32:18.200 --> 32:21.280
All valve has to do is place a call to these guys, these little guys, right?

32:21.280 --> 32:25.600
I mean, dude, if you're making this controller on your 3d printer and Gabe calls you up,

32:25.600 --> 32:27.200
yeah, you're going to answer that call.

32:27.200 --> 32:30.520
And if Gabe says, hi there, we'd like to work with you to integrate support for this into

32:30.520 --> 32:33.740
steam OS, shit, yeah, you're going to do that.

32:33.740 --> 32:37.120
And you see how they have such an advantage here if they take, if they just grasp it by

32:37.120 --> 32:40.700
the sack and they don't, you know what I want to see?

32:40.700 --> 32:44.880
So we, this was talked about in the mumble room before the show.

32:44.880 --> 32:51.560
Razer was there, big gaming company showing off one gaming related item and one non gaming

32:51.560 --> 32:52.960
related item.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.840
The gaming related item is called project Christine, right?

32:55.840 --> 32:57.000
The modular PC.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
We talked about this on last.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.960
We, we had a, we had a actual private interview.

33:00.960 --> 33:04.760
We got a, we got an interview, we got pictures, we got the whole thing that's going to be

33:04.760 --> 33:05.760
a video to watch.

33:05.760 --> 33:06.760
Yeah.

33:06.760 --> 33:10.880
Now we weren't able to actually touch any of the modules.

33:10.880 --> 33:11.880
Well yes and no.

33:11.880 --> 33:14.040
So they had a, they had two systems pre set up.

33:14.040 --> 33:15.040
Okay.

33:15.040 --> 33:18.440
So basically I don't know if you've seen pictures of project Christine, but it's, you know,

33:18.440 --> 33:20.640
it's a modular based system.

33:20.640 --> 33:23.320
That is of course a concept at this point for them.

33:23.320 --> 33:24.320
Right.

33:24.320 --> 33:25.320
Very much so.

33:25.320 --> 33:26.320
Very much so.

33:26.320 --> 33:29.000
However, it looks phenomenal.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
And you know what?

33:30.000 --> 33:35.040
I take that back when I said I didn't see Tux, Tux was there, Tux was there at the Razer

33:35.040 --> 33:36.040
booth.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.040
Oh really?

33:37.040 --> 33:41.640
Because on the front of projects Christine's box is a touch screen.

33:41.640 --> 33:42.640
Yeah.

33:42.640 --> 33:43.640
We were talking about this in last.

33:43.640 --> 33:45.080
It looked very, it looked very high tech.

33:45.080 --> 33:47.160
In fact, Matt said he'd buy it because of the screen alone.

33:47.160 --> 33:52.080
Well, the screen actually had three, three logos on it.

33:52.080 --> 33:54.160
It had a Tux logo.

33:54.160 --> 33:58.400
It had a Windows logo and I forget the third logo.

33:58.400 --> 34:00.680
It wasn't steam or anything.

34:00.680 --> 34:02.520
But yeah, it is fully modular.

34:02.520 --> 34:08.720
So on the back you, you pop in your SSDs, you pop in your, your memory and your CPU.

34:08.720 --> 34:14.080
The power supply is also module and it just looks very, very sexy.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.080
It's a very, very nice.

34:15.080 --> 34:17.560
Now granted though, it's very, very proprietary.

34:17.560 --> 34:18.560
Sure.

34:18.560 --> 34:19.560
Sure.

34:19.560 --> 34:27.080
You know, we were, Blackout 24 probably an OSD Warp logo, sorry, haven't seen that busted

34:27.080 --> 34:29.400
out in a while.

34:29.400 --> 34:34.920
So they obviously didn't have a price point for us, but they did tell us some really cool

34:34.920 --> 34:37.880
details on what they, their thoughts were on this.

34:37.880 --> 34:38.880
Oh yeah.

34:38.880 --> 34:44.160
But it's, it's one of those things where it'd be good for the beginner, quote unquote.

34:44.160 --> 34:51.400
And Joe and I, the, the, the co-host on Minecraft Me, and we were talking about this in a theoretical

34:51.400 --> 34:52.400
sense.

34:52.400 --> 34:57.120
What if they set this up like a cell phone where you buy the system.

34:57.120 --> 35:02.520
So for say $200 to $300, you sign a two year agreement, you pay a hundred dollars a month.

35:02.520 --> 35:05.760
And as they update modules, they, that you get, you get an upgrade.

35:05.760 --> 35:06.760
Yeah.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.560
In fact, I think Razer was even talking about a subscription service.

35:08.560 --> 35:09.560
Yeah.

35:09.560 --> 35:13.860
So I, I thought Matt, Matt made a throwaway remark on the Linux action show on Sunday

35:13.860 --> 35:15.120
that I thought was really poignant.

35:15.120 --> 35:20.580
And Matt said, if people will buy the Mac pro, people might buy this Razer PC because

35:20.580 --> 35:24.160
it has a lot of the advantages of a Mac pro with that, with that oil cooling.

35:24.160 --> 35:25.160
Right.

35:25.160 --> 35:29.360
It's, it's super, it's super slick looking, but it's way more powerful.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.280
But, but here's the big, but right.

35:31.280 --> 35:32.280
Well, potentially more powerful.

35:32.280 --> 35:33.280
Yeah.

35:33.280 --> 35:38.960
Big, but here with Apple, you know that they're not going to go away tomorrow, right?

35:38.960 --> 35:42.200
You know that, I mean, they've been around for a while.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.360
You know, they're going to support their devices for a while.

35:44.360 --> 35:46.760
The parts that you buy for it are not really proprietary.

35:46.760 --> 35:50.000
Do you really know the Mac pro is going to be around for a while?

35:50.000 --> 35:51.000
I don't think they do.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
Yeah.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.400
They, they, they change and drop stuff enough to where it's kind of like the company itself.

35:55.400 --> 35:59.400
But I think that form factors and such, it's like, you know what we need, we need a garbage

35:59.400 --> 36:00.400
can that runs software.

36:00.400 --> 36:03.400
And they put that out there, you know, it's just like, wow, really?

36:03.400 --> 36:06.580
If you came to me from five years in the future and you said, yeah, well that was the last

36:06.580 --> 36:08.080
Mac pro Apple ever made.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.560
You would not surprise me.

36:09.560 --> 36:10.560
Yeah.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.840
I mean, I see what you're saying, whereas like razor could start it and then never make

36:12.840 --> 36:13.840
another one.

36:13.840 --> 36:19.340
Very, very afraid because if I wanted to get a new hard drive, I would have no, no choice

36:19.340 --> 36:20.340
but to go through razor.

36:20.340 --> 36:21.340
I have no other, right?

36:21.340 --> 36:22.340
That sucks.

36:22.340 --> 36:23.340
That's actually a good point.

36:23.340 --> 36:24.340
Yeah.

36:24.340 --> 36:25.340
That does suck.

36:25.340 --> 36:28.100
I mean, obviously, you know, I think it was, I fixed it at the breakdown of the new Mac

36:28.100 --> 36:29.100
pro.

36:29.100 --> 36:30.100
Yeah.

36:30.100 --> 36:33.320
Granted, there is no way of doing it at this point, but you could drop out the parts, drop

36:33.320 --> 36:36.560
in a new CPU or a new SSD.

36:36.560 --> 36:39.240
That's going to be such a closed environment on the, on the razor side of things.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.920
You've got to buy a razor component.

36:40.920 --> 36:42.360
You're going to have to buy a razor component.

36:42.360 --> 36:43.360
Yeah.

36:43.360 --> 36:44.360
With that oil cooling hookup.

36:44.360 --> 36:47.160
Or without avoiding your warranty and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

36:47.160 --> 36:48.840
So we'll, we'll have to see.

36:48.840 --> 36:49.840
Wow.

36:49.840 --> 36:50.840
Cool.

36:50.840 --> 36:51.840
Cold water port on that one.

36:51.840 --> 36:52.840
Sorry.

36:52.840 --> 36:53.840
I just thought it'd be the ultimate Linux rig.

36:53.840 --> 36:54.840
No, I bet it would.

36:54.840 --> 36:55.840
I bet it would be incredible.

36:55.840 --> 36:56.840
I mean, the thing is right.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.200
I mean, here's the only thing though.

36:58.200 --> 37:02.000
If you're going to buy one, if they ever come out with it, first off, if you're going to

37:02.000 --> 37:08.360
buy it after it comes up, maybe, uh, maybe wait six months and then buy it, don't, don't

37:08.360 --> 37:09.680
be an early adopter on it.

37:09.680 --> 37:13.440
Even though it's very, very cool, Matt, even though that's awesome.

37:13.440 --> 37:14.520
Got away.

37:14.520 --> 37:15.520
Got away.

37:15.520 --> 37:19.320
Well, so, uh, we, I feel like we're doing a disservice now.

37:19.320 --> 37:23.600
I don't really, we got to talk about 4k, but I don't mean in a TV sense, did you see any

37:23.600 --> 37:25.800
computer monitors you could actually see yourself buying?

37:25.800 --> 37:28.440
I'm picturing gnome 3 on a 4k display.

37:28.440 --> 37:29.440
Yes.

37:29.440 --> 37:30.440
Yes.

37:30.440 --> 37:33.960
Uh, LG had an incredible is a 21 by nine ratio.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.640
So 21 by nine.

37:36.640 --> 37:38.720
That makes me uncomfortable on the inside.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.480
It's ultra wide, Chris.

37:40.480 --> 37:41.480
It's very ultra wide.

37:41.480 --> 37:42.480
That sounds ultra wide.

37:42.480 --> 37:43.480
Yeah, I know it is.

37:43.480 --> 37:48.780
Uh, but, uh, the, uh, LG had a few monitors there, uh, and actually I think you're going

37:48.780 --> 37:52.760
to, uh, bring it, bring up one of the, ah, yeah, I saw that there.

37:52.760 --> 37:53.760
There's 30 inch guy.

37:53.760 --> 37:54.760
What'd you think of this?

37:54.760 --> 37:55.760
Oh my God.

37:55.760 --> 38:00.920
So you could put literally four, 10 ADP screens on, on here.

38:00.920 --> 38:01.920
Four 1080p.

38:01.920 --> 38:02.920
Four 1080.

38:02.920 --> 38:04.400
So, so corner, corner, corner, corner.

38:04.400 --> 38:09.120
I mean, for video editing, this is, this is all, all, you know, I, when I went over there

38:09.120 --> 38:13.440
in the, the, uh, I think one of their spokes models, uh, and yeah, she was pretty hot.

38:13.440 --> 38:18.320
I was like, I was like, I so want this right now.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.880
Um, it's, it's, it's so cool.

38:20.880 --> 38:25.360
Now granted though, the problem is when you're looking at super high def or ultra high def

38:25.360 --> 38:30.380
or 4k or however you want to explain it, you got to make sure that you have a pretty good

38:30.380 --> 38:32.320
video card that can push this thing.

38:32.320 --> 38:34.800
Because remember, it's not just the size of the monitor.

38:34.800 --> 38:35.800
It's the size.

38:35.800 --> 38:36.800
It's the resolution.

38:36.800 --> 38:37.800
It's the pixels.

38:37.800 --> 38:38.800
And that's so much bandwidth.

38:38.800 --> 38:39.800
Oh, oh it is.

38:39.800 --> 38:40.800
Yeah.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.840
And I've, I've heard like in some cases what they're doing is they're splitting it into

38:42.840 --> 38:46.400
two 1080p signals and they're, and they're, what they're doing is, or not even, that's

38:46.400 --> 38:48.860
not even a fair way to say it, but they're essentially having it.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.360
So you have, uh, sort of like we used to have dual-

38:51.360 --> 38:53.800
Half the screen's handling, handling one side, half the screen's the other.

38:53.800 --> 38:54.800
Yeah.

38:54.800 --> 38:55.800
Thank you.

38:55.800 --> 38:56.800
Yeah.

38:56.800 --> 38:57.800
Yeah.

38:57.800 --> 38:58.800
So maybe that makes it a little more, uh, accommodable, but

38:58.800 --> 38:59.800
Well, here's the good news, right?

38:59.800 --> 39:02.520
The port, I believe handles 4k signal just fine.

39:02.520 --> 39:09.360
I also believe the new HDMI spec 1.4, uh, I could be wrong there, uh, also handles that

39:09.360 --> 39:10.360
new spec as well.

39:10.360 --> 39:14.280
So you still just have one cable going to your monitor.

39:14.280 --> 39:18.600
But the thing is, like you, Chris, I see this as a great production tool.

39:18.600 --> 39:20.600
For gaming, probably not.

39:20.600 --> 39:24.440
And the, sorry gamers, and the reason for that is simple.

39:24.440 --> 39:29.600
While it'd be great to have that, that big real estate, you can get big real estate now

39:29.600 --> 39:31.360
and don't need 4k high def.

39:31.360 --> 39:34.960
I mean, a lot of games will probably not even right now with the current graphics that are

39:34.960 --> 39:37.480
out there, but would probably struggle with that kind of resolution.

39:37.480 --> 39:41.280
I'm looking at how wide this is and there's really no way to visualize this unless you're

39:41.280 --> 39:42.760
looking at the video version of this show, but

39:42.760 --> 39:43.760
No, no.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.400
And not, and not even the quality either.

39:45.400 --> 39:49.280
It's like two 16 by nine displays put together in length and width.

39:49.280 --> 39:50.280
It's beautiful.

39:50.280 --> 39:55.200
You could watch, for example, a theater movie without bars because it's at the correct theater

39:55.200 --> 39:56.200
aspect ratio.

39:56.200 --> 40:00.720
I was just thinking, you know, when I'm doing this show, you know, I've got one, two, three,

40:00.720 --> 40:01.840
four, five.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.080
You could do it all on one, Chris.

40:03.080 --> 40:04.080
Yeah.

40:04.080 --> 40:05.080
I got five screens going right now.

40:05.080 --> 40:07.600
You could literally do this on one or maybe just two because you know you want to.

40:07.600 --> 40:08.600
Well, yeah.

40:08.600 --> 40:11.200
It's got to look like a cockpit after all.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.200
Yeah.

40:12.200 --> 40:14.440
I'd like you to try to mirror that twice.

40:14.440 --> 40:15.440
I know, right?

40:15.440 --> 40:16.440
Right?

40:16.440 --> 40:17.440
Yeah.

40:17.440 --> 40:19.840
It's going to make a mirroring displays to the live stream capture a little more difficult.

40:19.840 --> 40:23.280
Of course, 4k live streams are going to be a little ways out there.

40:23.280 --> 40:27.720
Well, you know, I've heard podcasters go like, hey, I want to do a 1080p live stream.

40:27.720 --> 40:30.760
I'm thinking, no one's going to be able to watch it.

40:30.760 --> 40:31.760
Right.

40:31.760 --> 40:32.760
And now 4k?

40:32.760 --> 40:33.760
Yeah.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.640
I mean, who's going to want to see the pores on my skin?

40:35.640 --> 40:36.640
Exactly.

40:36.640 --> 40:37.640
Come on.

40:37.640 --> 40:40.480
But for video game reviews and software reviews, I'd want it.

40:40.480 --> 40:41.960
Well, you know what?

40:41.960 --> 40:43.600
It reminds me of...

40:43.600 --> 40:46.360
Maybe the web's going to be okay with HD for a long time.

40:46.360 --> 40:47.600
You know, we saw this already.

40:47.600 --> 40:51.880
And Back to the Future 2, when Marty sat down from his long day at work, he says, show me

40:51.880 --> 40:54.160
17, 45, 37, and then Weather Channel.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.840
And it was all on one big panel, right?

40:56.840 --> 40:59.560
So we're seeing the future come to light.

40:59.560 --> 41:00.560
So true.

41:00.560 --> 41:01.560
So true.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.480
Well, we got to shift gears here.

41:03.480 --> 41:04.960
I want to talk about some big news.

41:04.960 --> 41:10.520
There was a really big Linux gadget for the home that was purchased recently.

41:10.520 --> 41:12.440
And I want to talk about that briefly.

41:12.440 --> 41:16.960
But before we get to that, I've got to thank Ting.com, another sponsor of Linux Unplugged.

41:16.960 --> 41:18.360
And Ting is mobile that makes sense.

41:18.360 --> 41:22.680
My mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider, Matt's rocking the Note

41:22.680 --> 41:23.680
2.

41:23.680 --> 41:24.680
I'm rocking the Nexus 5 right here.

41:24.680 --> 41:25.840
What do you think, Chase?

41:25.840 --> 41:26.840
You know what?

41:26.840 --> 41:32.800
Speaking of phones, my HTC One's coming back, but I'm really close to jumping ship to something

41:32.800 --> 41:33.800
else.

41:33.800 --> 41:34.800
Well, you might consider the Nexus 5.

41:34.800 --> 41:35.800
I know.

41:35.800 --> 41:36.800
I mean, that weight and that...

41:36.800 --> 41:37.800
It definitely beats the HTC One there.

41:37.800 --> 41:38.800
And I love the screen, too.

41:38.800 --> 41:39.800
And the thinness.

41:39.800 --> 41:40.800
Yeah.

41:40.800 --> 41:41.800
Yeah.

41:41.800 --> 41:42.800
So let's talk about Ting.

41:42.800 --> 41:43.800
So go over to Linux.ting.com.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.360
That's how you're going to get started.

41:45.360 --> 41:49.800
If you go to Linux.ting.com, that'll take $25 off your first device if you don't have one.

41:49.800 --> 41:52.440
If you've got a Sprint compatible device, they've got a BYOD page.

41:52.440 --> 41:55.040
You can check out what is compatible with the Ting network.

41:55.040 --> 41:58.600
If you bring your own device, they'll take $25 off your first month of service.

41:58.600 --> 42:03.880
Now average for Jupiter broadcasting switchers, the average monthly bill is about $33 a month.

42:03.880 --> 42:04.880
How do I know that?

42:04.880 --> 42:09.800
Because hundreds of Linux action show and Linux Unplugged and Koda Radio and TechSnap

42:09.800 --> 42:11.680
fans have switched over to Ting.

42:11.680 --> 42:12.960
And there's a good reason.

42:12.960 --> 42:14.240
You only pay for what you use.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.600
They take your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes at the end of the month.

42:16.600 --> 42:19.080
They add them all up, whatever bucket you fall into.

42:19.080 --> 42:20.680
That's what you pay over at Ting.com.

42:20.680 --> 42:23.120
Plus they have an incredibly powerful dashboard.

42:23.120 --> 42:27.920
And if you've struggled managing your wireless account, setting up where calls go, setting

42:27.920 --> 42:32.320
up call forwarding, setting up and deactivating phones, let me tell you, Ting refreshes all

42:32.320 --> 42:33.320
of that.

42:33.320 --> 42:36.560
They bring it into the 2000s and even into 2014.

42:36.560 --> 42:37.560
That's right.

42:37.560 --> 42:39.040
Ting has a 2014 compatible dashboard.

42:39.040 --> 42:42.340
And I suggest you go over to Linux.ting.com to get started.

42:42.340 --> 42:44.560
And by the way, now's a better time than ever.

42:44.560 --> 42:47.800
They have a savings calculator that's linked right at the beginning, right there at the

42:47.800 --> 42:50.200
front when you go to Linux.ting.com.

42:50.200 --> 42:54.720
If you use that savings calculator, plug in your existing wireless bill, like Mr. Chase

42:54.720 --> 42:55.720
over here.

42:55.720 --> 42:56.720
He has one of the top two.

42:56.720 --> 42:58.600
And if you went over there and plugged in his wireless bill-

42:58.600 --> 42:59.600
I have.

42:59.600 --> 43:00.600
He might shed a tear.

43:00.600 --> 43:01.600
Actually, you know what?

43:01.600 --> 43:02.600
A singular tear.

43:02.600 --> 43:03.600
I will say this.

43:03.600 --> 43:08.040
I'm very, very close to my unlimited data because I'm one of the few people that still

43:08.040 --> 43:09.040
have it.

43:09.040 --> 43:10.040
And I have done this.

43:10.040 --> 43:13.160
If I honestly didn't have unlimited data, then I would do this.

43:13.160 --> 43:16.160
Well, see, and this is great for me because I was in your same position.

43:16.160 --> 43:22.260
But what I realized is that I had this massive voice contract that I was using a tiny fraction

43:22.260 --> 43:23.260
of.

43:23.260 --> 43:24.260
I was paying-

43:24.260 --> 43:25.260
Oh, we have the voice.

43:25.260 --> 43:26.260
We overpay for voice so much.

43:26.260 --> 43:29.580
I was paying $120 per month for my smartphone plan.

43:29.580 --> 43:31.440
Now I pay around $30 per month.

43:31.440 --> 43:36.120
I get tethering and hotspot included, which is amazing, uses just the built-in Android

43:36.120 --> 43:37.120
features.

43:37.120 --> 43:39.960
So if you try out their savings calculator and you tweet out your results, you'll be

43:39.960 --> 43:43.880
entered into a drawing to win a Samsung Galaxy S4 for free.

43:43.880 --> 43:48.760
Plus there's going to be other lucky Ting contestants who get a $50 Ting credit.

43:48.760 --> 43:52.960
So if you go over to linux.ting.com, use that savings calculator, which is linked right

43:52.960 --> 43:55.520
there in the middle of the page with all of the happy people.

43:55.520 --> 43:59.220
You try that out, tweet out your savings results, Bob's your uncle.

43:59.220 --> 44:03.360
You can get entered to draw a Samsung Galaxy S4 from Ting.

44:03.360 --> 44:04.720
And I'm telling you, you're going to be so happy.

44:04.720 --> 44:06.520
It's the beginning of a new year, folks.

44:06.520 --> 44:07.520
2014 just started.

44:07.520 --> 44:12.080
Now is a better time than ever to go save by going to linux.ting.com and find out what

44:12.080 --> 44:15.760
I've been talking about and why I've been a happy customer for over a year now.

44:15.760 --> 44:21.440
Linux.ting.com and a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

44:21.440 --> 44:22.440
I'm serious, you guys.

44:22.440 --> 44:23.440
Bob's your uncle.

44:23.440 --> 44:26.240
This is a cell phone company that is doing it right and we should support them for doing

44:26.240 --> 44:27.240
it right.

44:27.240 --> 44:30.800
They're going to clean up the wireless industry one customer at a time, and I really mean

44:30.800 --> 44:31.800
it.

44:31.800 --> 44:32.800
Okay.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.080
So Chase, since you're here.

44:34.080 --> 44:35.080
Yes.

44:35.080 --> 44:39.320
Well, like it would only be appropriate in the spirit of Linux Unplugged, we should play

44:39.320 --> 44:40.360
a news clip.

44:40.360 --> 44:44.160
So right now on the show, I know, right?

44:44.160 --> 44:45.160
Breaking news.

44:45.160 --> 44:46.160
Wait, wait, wait.

44:46.160 --> 44:47.160
Today's Tuesday, right?

44:47.160 --> 44:50.160
I just want to make sure.

44:50.160 --> 44:51.760
Here we go.

44:51.760 --> 44:56.440
Google buys Nest Labs for $3.2 billion.

44:56.440 --> 45:00.000
In a surprising move, Google is getting into the home appliance business.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.280
The internet company announced Monday that they're buying Nest Labs for more than $3

45:04.280 --> 45:05.280
billion.

45:05.280 --> 45:10.480
Nest is known for reinventing home products like high-tech thermostats and smoke detectors.

45:10.480 --> 45:15.320
This is Google's second largest acquisition to date, and it's all part of its expansion

45:15.320 --> 45:16.320
into your home.

45:16.320 --> 45:17.320
So let's talk about this.

45:17.320 --> 45:20.520
Let's obviously bring back in Chief Vince's correspondent, Christine Romans.

45:20.520 --> 45:21.520
Surprising?

45:21.520 --> 45:22.520
Do you think it's a surprising move?

45:22.520 --> 45:27.200
You know, I think this is Google wants to be a part of this home appliance interconnected

45:27.200 --> 45:28.200
world.

45:28.200 --> 45:30.820
Look, what Nest does, it's this really cool device that it knows.

45:30.820 --> 45:34.760
It starts to learn your behavior and changes the temperature of your home based on what

45:34.760 --> 45:35.760
you're doing.

45:35.760 --> 45:40.280
It also has these really cool smoke detectors that are not annoying.

45:40.280 --> 45:43.560
There's actually a woman's voice that says, there is smoke detected, and it's not like

45:43.560 --> 45:44.560
screaming at you.

45:44.560 --> 45:46.600
You can wave your hand, and it will go off.

45:46.600 --> 45:48.640
So it's very user-friendly stuff.

45:48.640 --> 45:49.640
It's interesting.

45:49.640 --> 45:54.320
The guy who runs the company, used to be at Apple, helped design the iPod.

45:54.320 --> 45:58.200
You know, changed the clunky Walkman into something that's cool and user-friendly.

45:58.200 --> 46:02.160
Now doing the same thing with home appliances, I think it's a total natural fit for Google

46:02.160 --> 46:03.520
to get into this.

46:03.520 --> 46:06.960
What's so cool about Nest is Nest getting to know about you.

46:06.960 --> 46:08.480
Nest discovers you.

46:08.480 --> 46:09.480
Sounds like.

46:09.480 --> 46:10.740
Google obviously does the same thing.

46:10.740 --> 46:11.980
Is that the synergy here?

46:11.980 --> 46:15.920
Is this just a way for Google to get more places and find out more stuff about you?

46:15.920 --> 46:20.440
I mean, Google will now know what the temperature is in your bedroom, John Berman, if they, if

46:20.440 --> 46:21.440
you have a Nest.

46:21.440 --> 46:22.440
Hot, hot, hot.

46:22.440 --> 46:23.440
Oh geez.

46:23.440 --> 46:29.880
Yeah, so Google has bought one of the biggest internet of things, let's put lots of air

46:29.880 --> 46:36.320
quotes around that, device manufacturers, Nest Labs, for $3.2 billion.

46:36.320 --> 46:37.320
That's right.

46:37.320 --> 46:41.120
The maker of the smart thermostat and smoke detectors, and they've paid for it in cash.

46:41.120 --> 46:42.120
Wow.

46:42.120 --> 46:48.200
Nest has raised around $800 million from investors, including Google Ventures as one of the people.

46:48.200 --> 46:51.700
Now it's not exactly clear how Google plans to use Nest, but the company obviously sees

46:51.700 --> 46:53.520
it as an important part of its future.

46:53.520 --> 46:59.160
A combination of Nest Home Solutions coupled with Google's language recognition could give

46:59.160 --> 47:02.080
Google its strongest path yet to the, into your home.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.360
And this is a quote here.

47:03.360 --> 47:08.240
Google will help fully realize our, Google will help us fully realize our vision of the

47:08.240 --> 47:12.860
conscious home and allow us to change the world faster than we could if we continue

47:12.860 --> 47:16.840
to go it alone, wrote the owner of Nest Labs.

47:16.840 --> 47:21.520
We've got great momentum and now we've got a rocket ship.

47:21.520 --> 47:22.520
So guys.

47:22.520 --> 47:23.520
I'm afraid.

47:23.520 --> 47:24.520
I'm sorry.

47:24.520 --> 47:25.520
Are you a little comfortable?

47:25.520 --> 47:27.280
Google's already, Google's already everywhere.

47:27.280 --> 47:29.440
We don't need them in our homes.

47:29.440 --> 47:36.400
Do you guys remember those, there was like a comic strip a while back with the Google

47:36.400 --> 47:41.680
toilet where Google was analyzing what you were eating and recommending restaurants for

47:41.680 --> 47:42.680
you.

47:42.680 --> 47:43.680
Oh, geez.

47:43.680 --> 47:45.680
I guess it's becoming real now.

47:45.680 --> 47:49.200
I think that we should get it out of here.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.200
Nice.

47:50.200 --> 47:55.080
I see you're indirectly asking for a, get it out of here, or a mess quote.

47:55.080 --> 47:58.120
I think we should rename the show Linux Unfiltered.

47:58.120 --> 48:00.200
Well, so let's be honest.

48:00.200 --> 48:01.960
Don't we all want to live with Jarvis?

48:01.960 --> 48:05.640
Don't we all want the Starship enterprise where when something bad happens, we can look

48:05.640 --> 48:07.520
around and we can just say, what happened?

48:07.520 --> 48:08.520
I want to know.

48:08.520 --> 48:12.840
I want to have Major Barrett at the ready and say, you know, tea, Earl Grey, hot.

48:12.840 --> 48:15.360
And maybe Google's the company to make all of this happen.

48:15.360 --> 48:16.840
Matt, what do you think?

48:16.840 --> 48:21.160
Honestly, I think that this is going to be about as compelling as, I don't know, an ultra

48:21.160 --> 48:23.400
Vista purchase or something like that.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.840
I don't really see this as being that big a deal.

48:25.840 --> 48:27.960
First of all, Nest doesn't work very well.

48:27.960 --> 48:28.960
I'm just going to put that out there.

48:28.960 --> 48:35.100
I know people that have tried it and used it and it's kind of like an Android powered

48:35.100 --> 48:36.100
crockpot.

48:36.100 --> 48:39.840
It's cool for a while, but it's not really going to be as cost savings as people think.

48:39.840 --> 48:42.040
Be careful making fun of Android powered crockpots.

48:42.040 --> 48:43.800
I saw one at the show.

48:43.800 --> 48:44.800
They exist.

48:44.800 --> 48:45.800
Put the food in it for me, though.

48:45.800 --> 48:46.800
Unfortunately, it does not.

48:46.800 --> 48:48.760
And my wife brought up a very good point.

48:48.760 --> 48:52.960
If you left your food raw, sitting in that crockpot for an extended period of time, and

48:52.960 --> 48:55.280
then you're turning it on, is it safe to eat?

48:55.280 --> 48:56.280
You know?

48:56.280 --> 48:57.280
Yeah.

48:57.280 --> 48:58.280
So there's little things like that.

48:58.280 --> 48:59.280
I don't know.

48:59.280 --> 49:00.280
I definitely am.

49:00.280 --> 49:01.280
Yeah.

49:01.280 --> 49:02.280
You know, I'm kind of lukewarm on it.

49:02.280 --> 49:03.520
I think it was a big drain.

49:03.520 --> 49:06.480
Where was Android when Google bought Android?

49:06.480 --> 49:09.200
Well, nowhere.

49:09.200 --> 49:12.360
The same place the guy that created DOS was before Microsoft bought it.

49:12.360 --> 49:19.000
Here's what I ask you, my friends, is are we concerned at all about, and let's abuse

49:19.000 --> 49:22.640
the term, quote unquote, Internet of Things, are we all concerned about the Internet of

49:22.640 --> 49:26.960
Things being these Linux based devices that we have no control over, we have no access

49:26.960 --> 49:31.360
to the source code, and now that we are putting them in our home, we're installing them into

49:31.360 --> 49:35.480
our home, we're putting them on our walls, we're integrating them in with our daily lives.

49:35.480 --> 49:39.520
As a homeowner, as a homeowner, don't you want to be able to build and extend your deck?

49:39.520 --> 49:42.840
Don't you want to be able to alter the way your furnace works?

49:42.840 --> 49:47.000
Aren't we becoming the operators of the devices instead of the controller of the devices in

49:47.000 --> 49:48.440
our very own home?

49:48.440 --> 49:54.280
Aren't we surrendering control of our homes to, even if it is just in the smallest degree,

49:54.280 --> 49:58.280
even if it's just in the most minute way, aren't we surrendering control of our homes

49:58.280 --> 49:59.320
to corporations?

49:59.320 --> 50:01.560
I think the omnis had it right.

50:01.560 --> 50:04.360
You know, technology has just taken over us.

50:04.360 --> 50:06.320
We don't need it really, the omnis.

50:06.320 --> 50:09.120
Well, let me ask you, Chase, and I'll ask you this.

50:09.120 --> 50:15.240
I honestly am pretty much a stupid hairless monkey, and I can barely keep my shit together,

50:15.240 --> 50:16.240
and I'm amazed.

50:16.240 --> 50:17.240
You have a luscious beard, though.

50:17.240 --> 50:21.080
And I got to tell you, it impresses me that I manage to show up and do a show every single

50:21.080 --> 50:22.080
day.

50:22.080 --> 50:23.080
I don't even know how that happened.

50:23.080 --> 50:24.080
Right.

50:24.080 --> 50:25.640
And I believe it is only because of technology that I can get this far.

50:25.640 --> 50:29.280
So maybe this stupid hairless monkey, who's only been out of the jungle for a few thousand

50:29.280 --> 50:33.760
years, maybe I need more technology to make me more of a superior being.

50:33.760 --> 50:35.480
Am I just being afraid to change?

50:35.480 --> 50:38.960
Am I just, this is new, this is different, I don't like it.

50:38.960 --> 50:41.400
See, I like Nest.

50:41.400 --> 50:45.000
I don't have one yet, and I want to get one, just because of the fact that there's some

50:45.000 --> 50:50.200
really cool innovations in the home automation world and the home technology front.

50:50.200 --> 50:54.880
And to have those abilities to help make your life easier, I mean, let's say, for example,

50:54.880 --> 50:56.680
you're cooking in the kitchen, okay?

50:56.680 --> 50:59.960
I know you like to do the paleo thing, you're making some really good ribs, you're making

50:59.960 --> 51:02.760
some good stuff, but let's say you accidentally burn something.

51:02.760 --> 51:04.200
Maybe the bacon catches on fire.

51:04.200 --> 51:05.200
Maybe it does.

51:05.200 --> 51:06.200
Grease fires happen, Chase.

51:06.200 --> 51:08.280
And they do, unfortunately.

51:08.280 --> 51:12.600
So let's say that your detector's going off, right?

51:12.600 --> 51:13.600
What do you do today?

51:13.600 --> 51:19.240
You open up all the windows, you clear it out, you wave a towel, wouldn't it be easier

51:19.240 --> 51:24.120
just to pop up your phones, oh, false alarm, done, and it's off.

51:24.120 --> 51:29.800
It's those innovations that help make your life easier, and I don't see Google, this

51:29.800 --> 51:31.520
is where I kind of get weird by it.

51:31.520 --> 51:34.040
It's like, what is Google going to be doing with this?

51:34.040 --> 51:39.760
A lot of people forget, in the past, Google had, they worked with some power companies,

51:39.760 --> 51:43.800
I don't know if it's called Google Power, but you had the ability to track your power

51:43.800 --> 51:44.800
usage.

51:44.800 --> 51:45.800
Right.

51:45.800 --> 51:49.000
And by the way, during this time, during this study, which I believe this has actually now

51:49.000 --> 51:53.760
been discontinued by Google, Google figured out, and this is not a joke, you can look

51:53.760 --> 51:59.240
this up, they figured out what shows you were watching based on the power draw of your plasma

51:59.240 --> 52:05.000
TV, because when your plasma TV is brighter, it draws more power, and they would watch

52:05.000 --> 52:08.760
which shows had more white in them, they could figure out an algorithm, and then watching

52:08.760 --> 52:11.840
your power draw, they could figure out what shows you were watching at what time.

52:11.840 --> 52:16.680
Yeah, no, I like this technology, actually, I got some Kicksters that I still have yet

52:16.680 --> 52:17.680
to get here.

52:17.680 --> 52:22.240
One's a plug that works off of Wi-Fi, you plug it in the outlet, and it tells you the

52:22.240 --> 52:23.800
draw from that outlet.

52:23.800 --> 52:24.800
Yeah, I like that a lot.

52:24.800 --> 52:25.800
Kilowatts are great.

52:25.800 --> 52:29.600
I like one that runs off of the meter itself, so you know the measurement of the house coming,

52:29.600 --> 52:30.600
the power coming in your house.

52:30.600 --> 52:31.600
Really?

52:31.600 --> 52:32.600
Creepy, man.

52:32.600 --> 52:35.560
But I like having that information, because it makes me a smarter person.

52:35.560 --> 52:38.960
That's why I'm wearing a Fitbit right now, I like to track my sleep.

52:38.960 --> 52:41.400
So why wouldn't you want that on a house level?

52:41.400 --> 52:44.800
Why wouldn't you want that kind of customizable information on a house level?

52:44.800 --> 52:49.720
I do, but I don't want it reporting back to some central cloud computing company.

52:49.720 --> 52:50.720
Exactly.

52:50.720 --> 52:58.440
So as someone who plays with thermostats quite a bit, I can tell you that most of what Nest

52:58.440 --> 53:08.400
is doing, you can achieve by using Arduino with a Bluetooth shield, and it's not that

53:08.400 --> 53:12.060
hard to do.

53:12.060 --> 53:17.920
What they provide is just a nice box and a solution that you can just plug in and it

53:17.920 --> 53:18.920
works.

53:18.920 --> 53:24.200
With a little bit of effort, you can have the same thing running that's open source,

53:24.200 --> 53:29.400
open hardware, and you have full control over what information it's collecting and where

53:29.400 --> 53:30.600
that information is going.

53:30.600 --> 53:32.280
True, but you have to set all that up yourself.

53:32.280 --> 53:36.880
Matt looks familiar, he's bringing it up in the chat room, but in a post-Edward Snowden

53:36.880 --> 53:40.560
world, where we know that the NSA is working with all of these companies, Google being

53:40.560 --> 53:46.280
one of them, should we be worried about some sort of privacy invasion here from government

53:46.280 --> 53:47.280
overreach?

53:47.280 --> 53:48.280
I think so.

53:48.280 --> 53:53.040
I think it's cool for the very, very minute part of the population that really cares.

53:53.040 --> 53:57.960
I think that it's very cool, but for Google to spend this much money on it, I think they're

53:57.960 --> 53:59.120
kidding themselves.

53:59.120 --> 54:03.120
As someone that works in this industry, I'm telling you, they don't have any idea how

54:03.120 --> 54:05.280
hard it is to get people to adopt stuff like this.

54:05.280 --> 54:06.920
They have no concept.

54:06.920 --> 54:13.160
They went into this blind, they overpaid, and they have a really great way of doing

54:13.160 --> 54:14.160
it.

54:14.160 --> 54:16.960
Don't get me wrong, as far as interface and equipment and all that, it's really glossy,

54:16.960 --> 54:17.960
really sexy stuff.

54:17.960 --> 54:21.160
There's no question there, and it is cool to be able to turn your smoke detector off.

54:21.160 --> 54:25.680
But as far as there's other variables regarding to, especially with thermostats and stuff

54:25.680 --> 54:29.360
like that, energy prices, weather outside, there's a lot of things going on that people

54:29.360 --> 54:32.520
don't realize that Nest does not address.

54:32.520 --> 54:36.480
The gentleman that brought up the whole point on managing your own thermostat, that's what

54:36.480 --> 54:38.160
Nest does.

54:38.160 --> 54:41.120
That's literally their big claim to fame.

54:41.120 --> 54:42.120
It's really weak.

54:42.120 --> 54:48.120
$3.2 billion is not that much for Google, and I think a lot of it was patented, too.

54:48.120 --> 54:50.120
They probably did it for patents.

54:50.120 --> 54:52.100
I think they did it as a preventive measure.

54:52.100 --> 54:55.040
They know right now it has no value.

54:55.040 --> 54:57.440
They know that in the future it has a huge value.

54:57.440 --> 55:00.300
So look at just the straight tie-in with Google Now.

55:00.300 --> 55:05.040
So Google Now knows where you're at, when you're at that place, and maybe you're on

55:05.040 --> 55:11.840
your way home, Google Now would say, has detected, by the way, you've set home on your map destinations,

55:11.840 --> 55:16.360
so we will automatically turn on the heater in your house so your house is comfortable.

55:16.360 --> 55:20.240
Of course, the only thing I can think about these days is the new studio for Jupiter Broadcasting.

55:20.240 --> 55:24.660
I think about the fact that wouldn't it be cool if some thermostat learned when I showed

55:24.660 --> 55:29.960
up to do shows and made sure that I was comfortable when I got there and then saved money when

55:29.960 --> 55:31.080
I left.

55:31.080 --> 55:34.480
I look at this and I think, I don't like all the privacy implications, but I sure like

55:34.480 --> 55:36.600
not having to worry about one more thing.

55:36.600 --> 55:39.600
One more thing that I don't have to think about is worth a lot to me.

55:39.600 --> 55:40.600
Right, exactly.

55:40.600 --> 55:46.840
Well, once again, you could do that, like something as simple as this can actually be

55:46.840 --> 55:54.560
done with any programmable thermostat that you can buy in any hardware store.

55:54.560 --> 55:58.860
That's fine for you and I, but you're not going to convince grandma and grandpa who

55:58.860 --> 56:02.160
are shopping at Walmart to buy this.

56:02.160 --> 56:07.880
But what will happen in five years, in ten years, if you look at Android, at the beginning

56:07.880 --> 56:08.880
it was nothing.

56:08.880 --> 56:15.120
Look at it now, in the meantime it was all open source great, now it's closing to Google

56:15.120 --> 56:16.120
now.

56:16.120 --> 56:17.120
What will happen with this?

56:17.120 --> 56:18.120
Right.

56:18.120 --> 56:19.120
This is the big concern.

56:19.120 --> 56:22.840
And not only now, it's one thing when we're talking about our laptops and our desktop

56:22.840 --> 56:26.240
and we're talking about closed and proprietary software that we can't do anything about,

56:26.240 --> 56:30.280
but it completely is different when it's a piece of hardware that controls my home.

56:30.280 --> 56:34.000
If there's ever been a case for the GPL, it's right there in my opinion.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.560
And it's hardwired in your home.

56:35.560 --> 56:36.560
That's the other thing.

56:36.560 --> 56:42.120
The other thing that I want to point out and you mentioned the whole post Snowden thing.

56:42.120 --> 56:48.880
I think it's just a matter of time now before products start appearing on the market as

56:48.880 --> 56:54.680
competition to Google, as more people become aware of their personal information being

56:54.680 --> 56:59.520
reported back and used for marketing and sometimes being reported to governments.

56:59.520 --> 57:07.080
There's going to be a competitive market where they use words like respecting your privacy

57:07.080 --> 57:11.440
as something that people will want to buy.

57:11.440 --> 57:13.880
It's a feature that can become competitive.

57:13.880 --> 57:17.960
The same way people buy stuff because it's green now or organic.

57:17.960 --> 57:20.600
Yeah, I can see that for sure.

57:20.600 --> 57:21.600
Yeah, exactly.

57:21.600 --> 57:25.100
Boy, that's a great sort of like things are labeled organic, you could have things that

57:25.100 --> 57:28.200
are labeled secure in that same sort of marketing sense.

57:28.200 --> 57:29.200
Exactly.

57:29.200 --> 57:34.440
And then of course there's certified organic and then there's organic.

57:34.440 --> 57:39.080
Certified to be, and Mozilla has been making this case right this very week, Mozilla has

57:39.080 --> 57:42.440
been calling on the internet community to say, look, there's only one browser that is

57:42.440 --> 57:46.560
truly open source top to bottom that is used by the majority of users on the web and that's

57:46.560 --> 57:47.560
Firefox.

57:47.560 --> 57:51.360
Chrome's great, but if you want top to bottom transparency, you've got to come to Mozilla.

57:51.360 --> 57:54.920
Now obviously there's other browsers out there that are open source, but in terms of usage,

57:54.920 --> 57:57.920
Firefox aka Mozilla makes a very good point here.

57:57.920 --> 58:01.800
And this could be a point, and you already see people that are using this as a feature,

58:01.800 --> 58:02.800
right?

58:02.800 --> 58:06.360
John McAfee, he's all over the web right now talking about how he's building an NSA proof

58:06.360 --> 58:07.360
appliance.

58:07.360 --> 58:10.560
In our subreddit right now, there's a thread about the NSA proof Twitter.

58:10.560 --> 58:13.120
This is becoming a marketing buzz.

58:13.120 --> 58:16.720
So yeah, I think maybe we've got it nailed here.

58:16.720 --> 58:20.640
Some people buy devices that are tied in with this overall monitoring network and there'll

58:20.640 --> 58:25.320
be users like us who are willing to maybe go a little bit extra through the trouble,

58:25.320 --> 58:26.400
a little bit extra.

58:26.400 --> 58:29.720
We have to get a specific image, maybe we have to buy a Raspberry Pi, but we can roll

58:29.720 --> 58:30.720
our own solution.

58:30.720 --> 58:35.400
What a great way to kickstart the economy, create a problem, offer a solution.

58:35.400 --> 58:41.320
And I think this is going to become a push not only for open source software, but also

58:41.320 --> 58:49.040
for open source hardware because then the manufacturer or the company can say, hey,

58:49.040 --> 58:55.480
people can actually review what goes into our products and tell you, yes, this actually

58:55.480 --> 58:57.080
respects your privacy.

58:57.080 --> 59:01.680
This doesn't report anything you wouldn't want to anyone else.

59:01.680 --> 59:08.040
The only problem with all that is obviously the end company or the maker of that wants

59:08.040 --> 59:09.040
to make money, right?

59:09.040 --> 59:11.680
Of course, that's what drives a lot of people.

59:11.680 --> 59:16.360
And when you completely make it fully open like that, how do you protect IP?

59:16.360 --> 59:20.880
How do you protect your intellectual property on that kind of a system if you have it completely

59:20.880 --> 59:21.880
wide open?

59:21.880 --> 59:22.880
Right.

59:22.880 --> 59:25.840
You can do that in some cases for like a server load where you got Red Hat and they can sell

59:25.840 --> 59:27.240
commercial support.

59:27.240 --> 59:28.840
But how do you make it work?

59:28.840 --> 59:30.760
And let's go into the future here.

59:30.760 --> 59:34.340
How do you make it work in a world?

59:34.340 --> 59:38.600
How do you make it work when anybody can download a spec off the Internet and print their own

59:38.600 --> 59:39.600
device?

59:39.600 --> 59:40.960
And then they load the software themselves.

59:40.960 --> 59:42.340
How do you stay competitive?

59:42.340 --> 59:43.880
Because that is a reality we are facing.

59:43.880 --> 59:44.880
It's very big.

59:44.880 --> 59:50.760
Well, I can tell you right now, and you've admitted to this yourself a few minutes before,

59:50.760 --> 59:55.840
sometimes just because it takes a little bit more effort, it's already too much for some

59:55.840 --> 59:58.080
people to be interested.

59:58.080 --> 01:00:08.160
If it takes you building your own Arduino with a shield to make a secure nest like thermostat,

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.800
it's already too much work.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:16.440
So you prefer to pay someone else to do that work for you.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:29.960
And it's the same if someone else creates a fork of some open source project, then it

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.640
doesn't necessarily mean that it will be done as well.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:39.360
Like Arduino being a great example here, there are many copies of Arduino.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:47.440
Many of them are good, but no one actually provides as good of a quality product as the

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.080
original makers of Arduino.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.080
Right.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.080
Yeah, that's a great point.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:56.800
I'm just waiting for the day that Jarvis becomes reality.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:57.800
That would be awesome.

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.840
Google is definitely working on it.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:03.840
And you know, speaking of Jarvis becoming reality, one of the things that sometimes

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:07.120
feels a bit like the future is when your computer talks to you.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:11.760
And there's a really important kick, or actually it's an Indiegogo campaign that just kicked

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:16.800
off this week, bringing digital site to the vision impaired by the Accessible Foundation.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.400
This is an Indiegogo project.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.640
They got 31 days left.

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.320
They're trying to reach $100,000.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.320
They got $4,400.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:26.720
Now, I'm a big believer in these types of campaigns being a great way to fund open source

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:31.400
development and what these guys really want to do is they want to get Orca screen reader

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.400
to the next level.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.200
They want to bring it to the next level to make it accessible for the blind.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:40.480
And if you've got any kind of extra funds and a soft spot for this kind of thing, I'm

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.480
going to link to it in the show notes.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.320
I just wanted to give it a plug now.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:46.840
You can go over to Indiegogo.com and also search for bringing digital site and I think

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.480
that'll bring you to the project as well.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:51.840
They're only at $4,400, 31 days left to go.

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:56.200
Orca screen reader is a great project and it just needs some more love.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.200
Well they're trying to get to 100k.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.720
I submitted it to the subreddit earlier.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.200
It looks like it's actually doing pretty well.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.760
It is, yeah.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.680
The big issue here is a lot of people think, yeah, but that doesn't really affect me.

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.140
It's kind of like, well, here's the deal.

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:09.560
So proprietary desktops have this solved for years now.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.880
It's really not an issue.

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.860
It's a non-starter for them.

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:18.080
For Linux, it's something we've tripped over for years and we've seen all these quasi half

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:22.460
done kind of sort of started projects that then falter and fall apart and never really

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:23.460
become a thing.

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:27.840
Orca's the only thing that's really ever stuck around and stayed, but it has kind of hit

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.680
a glass ceiling and it does need some serious fundage.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.680
Yeah.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.080
So I'll put a link down in the show notes if this is something you guys have some interest

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.080
in.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:40.400
I'd love to see these guys get somewhere because, you know, it really is and it's about making

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:45.240
Linux accessible to a whole new class of folks who really deserve it.

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.240
And then we got an email.

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:49.160
I want to just wrap it up with an email from George where he says, hey guys, congrats on

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.160
the show.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.560
It's become the highlight of my week online.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.380
I wanted to say something about your reviews.

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.380
Don't get me wrong.

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:59.300
I completely understand the big development team slash company like, you know, SUSE, Canonical

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:03.000
versus the smaller development teams like your Mints and your Manjeros.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.280
It's a situation that these smaller distros might not, they might not exist one day or

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.280
in the near future.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:12.480
But I believe that there is innovation in usability ideas and custom solutions comes

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.000
from these smaller teams.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.480
And the only thing that they have in mind is the target of how to offer the user something

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:21.440
completely new and different from the established.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:24.040
There are distros out there that offer exactly that.

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.040
And you know what?

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:29.840
It doesn't matter that they disappear from one day because plenty will replace them and

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.560
innovation never ends.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.240
Having said that, it would be nice to do a review of some of the smaller distros that

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.640
are simply wonderful to use.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:42.400
How about Sabian 1401 for rolling or Netrunner 1312 which beats Kubuntu by a long way.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.680
Just give me food for thought, keep up the good work.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:52.280
So Matt, I have created in the show notes, just like a boss, I embedded them right in

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:56.760
the show notes a survey that folks, actually not even a survey, it's a quick form that

01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:01.960
folks can fill out and answer which distro they think is the innovative little guy.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:07.160
Is there a small distro that just at some point has impressed the heck out of you?

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:10.120
If you've been impressed by a little distro and you want to see it get a review on the

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.360
Linux Action Show, there is an embedded form in the show notes.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:17.640
I'll also paste it in the IRC chat room for those of you watching live right now.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:18.640
You can go out there and fill it out.

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:19.640
It's three simple questions.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:24.320
The name of the distro, the website URL, and what you thought was great about it.

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.520
You submit those to us.

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.880
I'll collect all of them and then we'll do, whichever one kind of comes ahead, we'll do

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.600
a review on the Linux Action Show in the future.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.600
What do you think of that, Matt?

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.600
I like that.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.600
It's a good idea.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.600
Yeah.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.320
I mean, personally, I'm kind of throwing my hat into Hannah Montana Linux, but that's

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.320
just me.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.200
I mean, it's a struggling distro.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.480
What about Rebecca Black Linux?

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:44.160
Well, you know, I like the pink of the Hannah Montana.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.480
You know, it really, really pinks up the whole situation.

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.480
That's true.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.480
I do like the pink.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.480
That's a good point, Matt.

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.800
So go fill out that form.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.360
We'll have it embedded in the show notes and in a future episode of Linux Action

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:58.680
Show, we'll give that distro a review right there.

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:02.520
And you know, I'd really like to find something that does something new and unique, something

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.640
really kind of innovative that we haven't seen before.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.280
And see, that's the real challenge I have with a lot of the distro reviews is that people

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:12.560
will say it does, but they never really identify what it is.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.920
So I mean, like with Arch, it's readily identifiable.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:16.920
They did package management in a unique way.

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:19.400
They did a basic installation in a unique way.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.400
Everything was done in a very, very good way.

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.400
They did everything right.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.400
Arch is the master distro.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.400
I agree.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.400
It really is.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.960
And then finding other ones that are basically, it's kind of like, oh, it's kind of like this

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:27.960
other one.

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:28.960
I don't know.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:29.960
We'll see.

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:30.960
We'll see what they come up with.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:31.960
Well, I agree.

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:32.960
And I think it could be a fun segment.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.400
We're going to call it the innovative little guy and we'll give it a review.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.640
Maybe we could make a whole series out of it.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.640
You never know.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.640
Never know.

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:38.640
Never know.

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:39.640
Well, I want to thank you, Mr. Chase, for joining us.

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:40.640
Oh, it's been a pleasure.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:41.640
You're going to have a ton of CES coverage.

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:42.880
Where can people find that?

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:43.880
All week.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:44.880
GeekGamer.tv.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.600
It'll be out over the next week to two weeks.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.640
Should be a lot of great stuff on there.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:54.960
And probably you'll give notices on Twitter, where can people follow you on Twitter?

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.960
At Nunes.

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.960
N-U-N-E-S is the best place to follow me on the Twitters.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:57.960
Very good.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.960
All right, Matt.

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.240
Well, if everything goes as planned, on Sunday, we're going to have an interview with an amazingly

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:06.520
talented photographer who does his entire workflow under Linux, including HDR photography.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.520
I'm going to watch that.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.080
And we're going to pick his brain and get his workflow.

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:10.080
Awesome.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.080
Cool.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.080
That's really cool.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:13.080
I can't wait for that.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.080
That's going to be a great show.

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.080
All right, Matt.

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.080
Well, I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:17.080
See you Sunday.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:18.080
All right, everyone.

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:21.240
If you love Linux Unplugged, we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.
