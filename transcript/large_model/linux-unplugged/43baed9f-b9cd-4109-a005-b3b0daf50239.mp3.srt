1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Did you hear? Flight Simulator is back.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,120
Oh, the classic.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,560
Yeah, the Microsoft game.

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,240
Hey, what's old is new again?

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,160
Well, yeah, because it's powered by AI in the cloud, I guess.

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,080
And uses Bing.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,880
What?

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,720
How do you-

9
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,540
Like the Bing data.

10
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,380
What?

11
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,880
Oh, for like the mapping and stuff.

12
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,920
Yeah.

13
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,240
Huh, okay, is there any way I can run this on Linux?

14
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,080
I don't know.

15
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,940
Okay, we'll probably come out on the PC and Xbox.

16
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,840
We don't know when yet.

17
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,120
Interestingly though, I mean,

18
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,720
we saw them doing stuff with Age of Empires.

19
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,920
It seems like Microsoft's jumping back into games.

20
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,920
They're saying exactly that, you know,

21
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,400
they want to be a game engine.

22
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,240
Yeah, I doubt they're going to bring it to Linux,

23
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,600
but if there's one gift Proton could give me,

24
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Flight Sim would be it.

25
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,200
That, I'd actually play that.

26
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,400
You might not get your work done.

27
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
Hello, friends, and welcome into a very special edition

28
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,400
of Linux Unplugged.

29
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
My name is Chris.

30
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,400
My name is Wes.

31
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
Hello, Wes.

32
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
This is Chris.

33
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,400
Welcome to a very special edition of Linux Unplugged.

34
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
Welcome to a very special edition of Linux Unplugged.

35
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Welcome to a very special edition of Linux Unplugged.

36
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
Welcome to a very special edition of Linux Unplugged.

37
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,920
Welcome to a very special edition of Linux Unplugged.

38
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,520
It is delightful to be with you today.

39
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
Oh, my.

40
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,080
We have a big show today.

41
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,720
What do you do after you got a fresh install?

42
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,920
We're going to chat with our virtual lug and each other

43
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,720
and figure out our perfect post install process.

44
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
That was pretty good.

45
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,720
Can you say it again?

46
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,720
No, I have no idea what I just said.

47
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,720
Perfect post install process.

48
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,720
Yeah.

49
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,360
I mean, really, this is actually something that we all have to consider.

50
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,040
It's like, what do you do to make your box perfect

51
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,640
and get back to work after you reload?

52
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,600
I asked this question today both to the live stream and to Twitter,

53
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,240
and I got a surprising amount of people saying

54
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,540
they just had reloaded their boxes today.

55
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,200
So it says, maybe there's something about October.

56
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Even if you don't change distros all the time,

57
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,200
it turns out we enthusiasts, we kind of install things a lot.

58
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Yeah.

59
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,680
And we got the perfect panel to go through all of this.

60
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,820
In fact, if I'm going to keep the alliteration going,

61
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,400
we have the perfect panel to plow through this process.

62
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,880
Hello, cheese and Mr. Alex.

63
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
Hello.

64
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
Hello.

65
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,080
I don't know how much plowing we'll actually be doing though.

66
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,240
Well, we'll plow through the field of knowledge.

67
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,240
So that's what matters.

68
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,760
I'm on a roll.

69
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
Just go with it.

70
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,840
Pedantically, perfectly pedestrian.

71
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,480
I can hold a straight face, but when Wes cracks,

72
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,120
it makes me laugh every single time.

73
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,160
And of course, we have our virtual lug time appropriate greetings, Bumble Room.

74
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
Good morning.

75
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
Hello.

76
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
Howdy, hello.

77
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,160
Happy Linux Tuesday.

78
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,040
Listen to that group.

79
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
This look at this.

80
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,480
You got Brent, Byte, Carl's in there, Jill's in there, Jimmy, Minimac, Sean, Tat Tech,

81
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,480
and back after a long travel period, Mr. Martin Wimpers.

82
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,480
Hello, Wimpy.

83
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,480
Hello.

84
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,400
I'm really glad you made it today because Bunta Mate is in the news.

85
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,160
So how about that?

86
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
Perfect timing.

87
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
We'll get to that.

88
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:49,360
But let's start with OpenSUSE, which may be called something else soon.

89
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,200
During discussions about the OpenSUSE project logo and name change that started in June,

90
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,400
which we talked about, the election committee received a request from the board to conduct

91
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:05,040
a vote whereby the OpenSUSE members can indicate whether they are for or against the project

92
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,360
name change.

93
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,040
Voting starts October 10th and runs to the end of the month, so three weeks to vote.

94
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Hmm.

95
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,500
What would you call it, Wes?

96
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,440
If you could name it, what would you name it?

97
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Linux.

98
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,880
Linux S Edition.

99
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,880
What about you, Wimpy?

100
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,600
If you could name OpenSUSE today, what would you name it?

101
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,360
Linux like it used to be.

102
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Yeah.

103
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
Yeah.

104
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
That's good too.

105
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Yeah.

106
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,660
Or why not call it yet another distro?

107
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,660
We have fun.

108
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,660
Oh, that's good.

109
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,660
Yeah.

110
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,920
We have fun.

111
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,280
I've been using OpenSUSE for so long.

112
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,420
I used OpenSUSE before they called it OpenSUSE.

113
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,840
They called it SUSE back in my day.

114
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,600
It is always interesting just watching the project function, right?

115
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,600
This is a big decision and you need a way to be able to constructively discuss that

116
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
as a community.

117
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,900
So, power to them.

118
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,960
This is actually a great opportunity.

119
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,120
And I wonder if we won't see something that's chameleon inspired or something like that.

120
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
Yeah.

121
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
That makes sense.

122
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,480
And much like I make fun, but I also have love for OpenSUSE.

123
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,680
You know, it's a project that I have a long heritage with and it has been around for a

124
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,960
long time and we will follow the story with interest because it does matter.

125
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Absolutely.

126
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:26,840
Now, I am supremely elated, I can't think of an alliteration on that, to talk about

127
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,480
Ubuntu Mate 1910's new release notes.

128
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:39,880
Now this is a beta at this point, but I wouldn't necessarily say that's a bad thing.

129
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,200
I mean, we're all, I think if you're listening to this podcast, you're probably comfortable

130
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,400
trying out a beta at this stage.

131
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,840
And if not, well, stay away.

132
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,400
And maybe you have that particular piece of hardware that they need a bug report on and

133
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,080
this is the perfect time to do it.

134
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,880
A great way to give back.

135
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,600
So I normally would say, you know what, let's skip a beta.

136
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,300
But I'm actually, I'm changing a little.

137
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,360
I think Wimpy, you've convinced me, I listened to the Ubuntu podcast, you convinced me at

138
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,920
this stage, and especially for this particular crowd, I'm not saying for everybody, but for

139
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,040
this crowd, actually give a beta a go because there's a lot in here and maybe you can catch

140
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
something.

141
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Yeah.

142
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,520
So I did express this sentiment on the last episode of the Ubuntu podcast.

143
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
It's quite frustrating.

144
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,300
And this is not an Ubuntu Mate specific thing.

145
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:34,080
This applies to insert name of your favorite Linux distribution.

146
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,240
You quite often see the leads of the various distributions post about their, you know,

147
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,960
their betas and their release candidates.

148
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,680
And you will see a series of replies that say, oh, well, it's a beta.

149
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,200
It's a release candidate.

150
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,320
I'll come back and install it when it's stable, when everybody else has done the hard work

151
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,180
to make sure it's okay.

152
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:03,000
And then you see those very same people whinging when stuff that's important to them doesn't

153
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
work.

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,840
Like maybe random wifi issues that plague one particular user who perhaps could have

155
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,920
caught it earlier in the cycle.

156
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Right.

157
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
Exactly so.

158
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:19,320
So, you know, what you need to do is actually think about, you know, what your social responsibility

159
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,620
is for your favorite distribution.

160
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,400
If you're a distro hopper, I know this doesn't apply because you don't care because you just

161
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,080
hop distros as soon as it gets hard on the distro that you've chosen.

162
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,480
But if you're invested in a particular distro, do test the betas, do test the release candidates

163
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:42,340
and see if you can find something that's not working for you that can help improve the

164
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,720
final product because it won't magically get better if people don't do that.

165
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,480
First of all, I want to say a fantastic write up.

166
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,120
We'll have linked in the show notes on this new release.

167
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,240
I don't know what you're going to do now for the actual release because you can't top this.

168
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,040
So it's these notes.

169
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,880
In fact, this is a living document.

170
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,320
So as we're fixing things, you'll see that there are this is what we fix since the beta

171
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,880
it already started to appear in this document.

172
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
Oh, great.

173
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,360
And then just just tangently, I'm just curious, did you write it with emoticons inline or

174
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,680
did you write it and then go back and enhance it with the emoticons?

175
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,040
Obviously, you put the emoticons in as you type it, because that's what, you know, sensible

176
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,120
human beings do in 2019.

177
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,080
I mean, solid execution, I got to say.

178
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,440
So you call this a paper cut release in this post, but yeah, I'm looking at this and I'm

179
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:39,520
thinking maybe I mean, this is it's more it's more changes than you'd see in a Mac OS release.

180
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,200
It feels like it's a yes, it's paper cuts, but it's also it's really kind of when you

181
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,280
add it all up.

182
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,080
It's a substantial amount of change.

183
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
It is.

184
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:56,160
There are significant changes, but addressing paper cuts is the undertone to everything

185
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,400
that we addressed in this release, even when it's big stuff like changing the default email

186
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
client.

187
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,600
You know, there is a bigger story there about the paper cut that addresses.

188
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
All right.

189
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,760
So let's get to that.

190
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,520
But first, I want to talk about a couple of things that I'm impressed with.

191
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,160
It really feels like the pain points that users actually see on a day to day basis is

192
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,880
what was addressed here, like the changes with Marco.

193
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Oh, yeah.

194
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,080
The Marco, like the Marco is where is the Monte window manager and no more tearing high

195
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,520
DPI improvements, things like that that users see.

196
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:41,360
But there's other smaller things like changing out VLC for celluloid and evolution, replacing

197
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,360
Thunderbird.

198
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
Right.

199
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,200
So what is that about?

200
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,480
So there was two things going on with both of those.

201
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:56,960
The three driving things were this improving the desktop integration.

202
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:04,880
If you read the post, evolution offers superior desktop integration than Thunderbird does.

203
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,440
You know, evolution will integrate with the desktop environment in a better way.

204
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,040
Like the calendar applet.

205
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,520
And that's a follow on, right?

206
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:18,400
So once you've once you've made that jump to, well, let's do evolution, then then it's

207
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,280
right, well, let's improve the indicators to actually make that indicator do something

208
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
useful.

209
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,120
So rather than just being a static calendar that does nothing.

210
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,440
Now it reflects all of the events that you've got in your calendars.

211
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,840
Is it the evolution data server that is its own separate component that that the other

212
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,120
things can query that makes this possible?

213
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Is that why it's why Thunderbird can't do this necessarily or isn't currently doing

214
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
this?

215
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
That's exactly why it is.

216
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,400
Evolution has the evolution data server.

217
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,360
So once that's hooked up and you've connected it to, you know, wherever your calendars and

218
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,280
tasks and things exist, then that's automatically reflected in the indicator.

219
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,240
And this has been something that I've wanted to get in the desktop forever because that's

220
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,200
super useful, you know, and then you get notifications from that thing as well.

221
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Yes.

222
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,560
Having it in the actual calendar is game changer for me with all the meetings we have.

223
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,880
And you kind of expected in 2019.

224
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,680
And I think the other thing to note here because you and I have talked off air about this,

225
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,720
but I don't know if we really said much on air is that evolution hasn't necessarily been

226
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,720
standing still.

227
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,820
The project has been developed.

228
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,820
It's been bug fixed.

229
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,480
It's it's in a it's in a pretty good spot now.

230
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,760
Yeah, it is.

231
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,480
You know, I've I've tried evolution on and off over the years, you know, I've I've revisited

232
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,560
it several times just within Ubuntu Marte's lifetime to think, you know, to test.

233
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
Is this the right time?

234
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,120
And it never quite has.

235
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,080
But right now, it's a really robust option.

236
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:53,680
It's a native, you know, mail calendar task memo client, and it's got tight desktop integration

237
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,120
and it's very compelling.

238
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,720
So I you know, I spoke to the rest of the core team and some of the upstream Marte developers

239
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,140
and I was surprised to learn that a number of them were already choosing to install evolution

240
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,880
and it was their default mail client already.

241
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,000
And they, you know, rattled off a number of reasons as to why that was.

242
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,680
So it's now the default.

243
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,200
I know that some people will not want that.

244
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,220
They will continue to want Thunderbird and hey, that's fine.

245
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,840
You know, Thunderbirds in the software boutique or you've got the option to do a minimal install

246
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,160
and then install the apps that you prefer over the top.

247
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,840
But what you know, as a distro maintainer, what you're trying to deliver is the best

248
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,500
outcome that you can deliver to most of the people most of the time.

249
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,160
And I feel that evolution is the tool that does that.

250
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,800
Well, I interestingly enough, this is where I've landed myself.

251
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,080
Having gone back to Thunderbird for some things.

252
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,760
But after trying out mail spring, which I can't remember the name of it before that,

253
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:00,480
but you know, a so I'm looking for something that treats Google Apps as a first class citizen,

254
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,560
because that's what our company have all your data in there.

255
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,680
And I need to get access to it to do my job.

256
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,680
I don't have a choice.

257
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,160
I don't get to pick what mail service they use.

258
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,800
And mail spring is a real, like, top tier Google Mail support, like really integrated

259
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,600
the Nylas stuff, right?

260
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
That's what it was.

261
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
That's right.

262
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Yes.

263
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,200
But it's an electron app.

264
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
And I'm not.

265
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
No, no, it's fine.

266
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
It's fine.

267
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,220
It's just when you have 1000s of emails, I don't it's just what it is.

268
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,400
It really does get slow.

269
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,380
And I tried to work with it in different iterations.

270
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,480
And I ended up going back to evolution.

271
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,240
In part because I was I was noticing that a couple of developers that I was chatting

272
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,320
with because I like to I spy at the headers were using it.

273
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,060
And I thought, Oh, that's interesting, because I know these these particular gentlemen get

274
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,040
a lot of email.

275
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:56,120
And I thought, well, if these guys who likely get more email than I do are using evolution,

276
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
maybe it's worth a go for me.

277
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,400
And then I started I telegrammed wimpy.

278
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,640
And I said, this is a few months ago, I said, wimpy what email client are you using?

279
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,920
And wimpy had switched evolution, because we were kind of on the same page with what

280
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,080
what our requirements are.

281
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,320
And so I gave it a go.

282
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,520
And I found that works pretty well with Google Apps after you change a few defaults, like

283
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,240
where your sent items are stored and things like that.

284
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,520
But my takeaway was from having used it eight years ago, when I was desperate for exchange

285
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:32,760
integration, what I considered a heavy duty application back then is a tight, native,

286
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,280
low resources application today.

287
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:42,040
Evolution back then seemed so clunky with its client side and data side that was always

288
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,960
running in the background, and just seemed ridiculous.

289
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:54,520
Eight years ago, today, it uses a tiny percent of the RAM that mail spring used.

290
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,560
And it provides a data interface for things like wimpy is talking about, like the calendar,

291
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,400
it just has been a much better switch.

292
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:07,320
And even just setting it up, and having it connect to my calendars means that my applets

293
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,420
are always up to date.

294
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,720
Even if I just use the web version of Google Apps Mail, my calendar on my desktop is still

295
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
current.

296
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
That is nice.

297
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,800
So that's in there.

298
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,480
And then I think we have to talk about something that's not just going to benefit Ubuntu Mate,

299
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:28,480
but Ubuntu Xfce, Zubuntu, the Cinnamon versions, the GNOME versions, the KDE versions, all

300
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,100
of them are possibly, if they choose to use it, going to benefit from this Mate Optimus

301
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,100
support that you've added.

302
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,880
Now, it's going to be turned on, I believe, by default on Ubuntu Mate, if you have an

303
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:46,960
NVIDIA driver, but this is some really nice, easily accessible functionality that before

304
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,280
was pretty complicated for end users to get access to.

305
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,760
So what's happening here with Mate Optimus?

306
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:59,180
Okay, so this is a mechanism by which you can switch between, you know, the Intel IGP

307
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:05,720
and the NVIDIA GPU on hybrid graphics systems.

308
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,480
So this has been in Ubuntu Mate for some years, and it just enabled you to switch between

309
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:18,240
the Intel GPU and the NVIDIA GPU, and it required you to log out in between times.

310
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:27,720
But with the NVIDIA 435 drivers, they've added a new mode, which is on demand, or, you know,

311
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,160
technically it's called the NVIDIA Prime Renderer.

312
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:39,760
And if you enable that, the Intel IGP and the NVIDIA GPU are both enabled at the same

313
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,740
time, and the NVIDIA GPU goes into this, you know, power saving state.

314
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:50,920
So your desktop is rendered using the Intel IGP, but then you can choose to run specific

315
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,760
applications or games on the NVIDIA GPU on demand as you require it.

316
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,280
So we've got a little indicator that enables you to flip between that, and that indicator

317
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:08,040
will only show up if your system meets all of the necessary hardware and, you know, configuration

318
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
requirements.

319
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,280
But once you're in on demand mode, we've got a couple of little utilities called Offload

320
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:19,680
GLX and Offload Vulkan, which are command line applications, which you can just use

321
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,240
to prepend in front of the command you want to run in order to, you know, run that particular

322
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:32,360
game or application on the NVIDIA GPU for, you know, GLX acceleration or Vulkan acceleration.

323
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
You can work with that.

324
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,480
Without having to log out and log in.

325
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
Exactly so.

326
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Yeah, just all dynamic.

327
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,000
So, you know, you can do the same stuff that you can do, you know, with other, you know,

328
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Intel and AMD where you can run one workload on the Intel IGP and another workload on the

329
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,540
NVIDIA GPU, and that can all happen simultaneously now.

330
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,400
So what happens if I do Offload-Vulkan-Steam?

331
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,280
Well, every sub-process that Steam executes, like the game and all of that, will that...

332
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
Yeah.

333
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:07,600
So at the moment, it works, you know, there's some clever machinery behind those two commands

334
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,400
in order to make that happen.

335
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,040
And that was where I got to with the limited time I had available.

336
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:20,720
But what I'm thinking of doing is embedding into that indicator, maybe just the games

337
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,200
category from the menus, so that you can launch, you know, right click a game and say, launch

338
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,440
this game, you know, on the NVIDIA GPU.

339
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,400
So it's all, you know, integrated rather than you having to know what the terminal incantations

340
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
are.

341
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Right.

342
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
That'd be really fun.

343
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,680
That'd be a great way for regular old folk to be able to get that running without having

344
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,680
to mess with it.

345
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,760
Martin, may I say, thank you very much.

346
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,600
That sounds absolutely fantastic.

347
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
I do have a question.

348
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
Sure.

349
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,000
So I have a Lenovo P50, which I got given through work, and I've tried to use that with

350
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,020
GPU pass through.

351
00:17:54,020 --> 00:18:01,220
And the NVIDIA GPU that's in there, the outputs are hardwired to the HDMI ports and whatever.

352
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,080
In that situation, is this going to work for me or not?

353
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,560
Yes, it can do.

354
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,720
So it requires a little bit of setups.

355
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Really?

356
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

357
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,860
So if you've even if you've got one of those, like NVIDIA mining GPUs that have no outputs

358
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,000
at all, you can make this work for you.

359
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Dude.

360
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,240
So in the in the project's GitHub page, there's a link to an NVIDIA document.

361
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,840
It's part of their installation instructions on how to set up what's called a GPU screen.

362
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:40,680
And what you basically say is this Intel IGP is providing a screen for this NVIDIA GPU.

363
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:46,480
And when you're in on demand mode and you tell it to offload to the NVIDIA GPU, it displays

364
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,480
to that that whatever, whatever that Intel IGP is rendering.

365
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
So it will work.

366
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,640
So if you've got one of those and you can get these super cheap on eBay now, you know,

367
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,520
if you've got one of these mining cards from NVIDIA that's got no outputs at all, you can

368
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,880
now use it as an accelerated, you know, gaming graphics card.

369
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,640
So this only works with NVIDIA, though, correct?

370
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,520
Doesn't work with AMD GPUs?

371
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
Correct.

372
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,800
This is this is currently an NVIDIA Intel only solution.

373
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,480
But, you know, I've I've been experimenting and I've thankfully had a review unit from

374
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,040
Dell for far too long, which has got Intel and AMD.

375
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,680
And I've manually, you know, looked at what's required to do this with Intel and AMD as

376
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
well.

377
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,560
So maybe at some point, if I get enough time, I will fold that in as well.

378
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:40,260
So it will be a more encompassing tool, irrespective of, you know, what your GPU choices are.

379
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,120
But this would work with an eGPU?

380
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Yes.

381
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
Yes, it will.

382
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:49,440
I say yes, it will, providing providing it can present as, you know, an optimus system.

383
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,440
Right.

384
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
Yes.

385
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
In general, yes.

386
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
Right.

387
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
Which I think actually my eGPU does.

388
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
Yeah.

389
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,200
Most of the Thunderbolt based systems do present as though they're a hybrid system.

390
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,800
So yeah, they tend to work.

391
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:07,340
How much of an enabler is it to have the NVIDIA driver in the upstream Ubuntu ISO now?

392
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:12,080
So how much does that now you just can assume that if the user has an NVIDIA card that

393
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,520
they have access to the driver, so now you can build tools like this on top of it?

394
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,520
Right.

395
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
Yeah.

396
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
So that's definitely part of it.

397
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,680
So the NVIDIA drivers are now present on the ISO image.

398
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:29,260
And that's really so that if you're installing and you don't have internet access, the drivers

399
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:34,540
are there on the on the ISO in a local app repository.

400
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,600
So if you tick the box that says give me third party drivers, there's a source to install

401
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,900
those drivers, even if you're not connected to the internet.

402
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,020
So that's where that comes from.

403
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:51,660
But it does mean to say that if you are an NVIDIA user, you are likely going to come

404
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,760
out the other side of the install with the NVIDIA drivers automatically installed and

405
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
enabled.

406
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,920
And what's most important is the way we're delivering the Intel drivers now, they're

407
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,100
in the Ubuntu archive, they're in the main archive, and they are going to continue to

408
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:14,820
get updates through the same SRU process that we use for things like the Firefox browser.

409
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:20,460
So as new versions of the drivers become available, no need for PPAs.

410
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,980
They will just appear in the main archive.

411
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,820
And because they're in the main archive, they're also signed.

412
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,540
So that means you can leave secure boot enabled for your NVIDIA drivers now.

413
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,540
Fancy.

414
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,540
That really is a big deal.

415
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,540
That is a big deal.

416
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,900
I think 19.10 Ubuntu Mate is shipping up to be quite a beauty.

417
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,940
So if you'd like to give it a go and send them your feedback, link in the show notes.

418
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,940
I mean, yeah, right?

419
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,620
Look at all the hard work that they've been doing.

420
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,700
They can use a little help testing it out.

421
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,900
I'm loving this GPU work.

422
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,900
How about you, Alex?

423
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,900
But can it run Crysis?

424
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,900
Well, now it can.

425
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,340
Seriously, Martin, that is some amazing stuff.

426
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,220
I am so happy to hear that.

427
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,220
Thank you.

428
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,620
Yeah, that's good.

429
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:06,540
So let's chat briefly about Fedora Workstation 31 beta, which is now out and Fedora 31 is

430
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
around the corner.

431
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,980
They're doing a lot of work on ExWayland on demand.

432
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,900
They say the goal is ExWayland on demand applications.

433
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,780
When you need to run an ExWayland application, it would actually then start all the stack

434
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,780
at that time instead of running it all the time using up resources.

435
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,180
Sounds nice, but it's also a lot of work and this work has been contributed from a lot

436
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,820
of people and companies.

437
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:34,100
All started off with some work from Ian Lane at Canonical for the system to user session

438
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,620
patches which really needed to happen to make this possible.

439
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,100
Those have been lingering, so Benjamin Berg took those patches on and actually got them

440
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,340
over the finish line, merged upstream.

441
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:49,420
Now this isn't a hard requirement for Wayland on demand necessarily, but since it makes

442
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:54,980
a lot of things work nicely between Ex and Wayland, it makes the rest of the process

443
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,980
a lot smoother.

444
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,980
Yeah.

445
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,220
Future work should be simpler to implement, which means future versions of GNOME Shell

446
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,820
will have this work in them.

447
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:08,980
It also means that you could potentially get a little bit more battery saving and this

448
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,500
work could expand to include other things in your computer like maybe the Bluetooth

449
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:19,500
stack and other things that don't necessarily need to be on until the desktop session requires

450
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
them.

451
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,500
That's some of the work they're doing here.

452
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:27,780
Well, another piece that you might like, Chris, is Firefox running natively and nicely on

453
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,780
Wayland.

454
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,780
Very much, yeah.

455
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,100
In Fedora 31.

456
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,100
Smooth as butter.

457
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,100
That's what you want.

458
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,220
I really have been appreciating that.

459
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,740
There is some bugs, so they're still working on it right now.

460
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:44,660
You have both versions that will be available in Fedora 31 and still, if you are using the

461
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,780
NVIDIA binary driver, Fedora Workstation 31 will disable Wayland by default right now.

462
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:55,060
That's because, well, there's a lack of acceleration under X Wayland, so any application depending

463
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,700
on GLX, like a lot of games, will just get software rendering with the binary NVIDIA

464
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,700
driver for now.

465
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,700
Yeah.

466
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,700
I mean, there's not much anybody can do.

467
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,860
It's really up to NVIDIA.

468
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:08,820
They have to do that work, which it does seem like some of that is in progress.

469
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:14,700
I guess they told some folks at Red Hat and on the Fedora project that there is work in

470
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
progress on that.

471
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,980
But as they write in this post, which we'll link in the show notes, we don't have a timeline

472
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:26,260
yet, but it's being actively looked at and hopefully a proper date will be provided soon.

473
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,260
A timeline for a timeline.

474
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,180
I don't know, Les.

475
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:35,540
Also just of note, if you are a daily Fedora user, you may have noticed some Sketch H.264

476
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,540
support.

477
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,740
Well, that's going to get a lot better in the next version of Fedora as well.

478
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,740
Isn't that nice?

479
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,220
I mean, boy, time's a change.

480
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,220
Yeah, really.

481
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,220
That is a big time changer.

482
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,660
And then also, pipe wires, there are not a lot of changes in Fedora 31, but there will

483
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:54,820
be what they're planning is major changes in 32.

484
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,820
So take a look at it.

485
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,820
Keep an eye out for that.

486
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,820
Oh, boy.

487
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,820
I guess an ear out.

488
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,820
Keep an ear out.

489
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,820
Yeah.

490
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,820
Yeah.

491
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,820
Promises to revolutionize things, maybe.

492
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,820
Not yet.

493
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,820
Yeah, that's what they say.

494
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,500
Pulse audio, like we've never known it before.

495
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,580
The end goal, like the ultimate goal, though, Les.

496
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,580
You ready for this?

497
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,100
Get ready, ladies and gentlemen.

498
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:22,420
PipeWire will ship as the default audio handler with a way to switch back to pulse audio in

499
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,420
Fedora 33.

500
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,420
Okay.

501
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:30,700
So I'm just going to plan to skip 33, go right to 34 on the Fedora side.

502
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,820
Just stick with CentOS Stream if you're a Fedora user during that time, because it's

503
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,100
going to be a bumpy ride.

504
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:42,340
But a lot of work in general has gone into the performance of Gnome.3.34.

505
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:47,140
It really stands out right now if you try out Ubuntu 19.10 proper.

506
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,700
Some of that same work, because it's by some of the same folks, will land in Fedora 31.

507
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:59,340
So I'm very, very, very happy as somebody who is softly trying out Gnome Shell again.

508
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,860
That's another sign of times that have changed, right?

509
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,100
It's a pretty nice desktop environment these days.

510
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:10,340
I love this moment here towards the end of the post, again, linked in the notes.

511
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,660
They talk about how, read that part about the great performance work there, because

512
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,660
I just love the sentence.

513
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,820
And I'll read the sentence after it.

514
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,620
It's towards the bottom there.

515
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:24,780
This release features a lot of great performance work by our friend Daniel von Vogt from Canonical

516
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,820
and Georges Stravakis from Endless.

517
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,140
Part of that was really, I just didn't want to say those names.

518
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,220
Okay, so I like this because it's awkward for them.

519
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,620
Because here they are, the shepherds of Gnome Shell after all this time.

520
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:42,500
But the awkward situation is Canonical's come along and busted out some serious performance

521
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,500
work.

522
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,220
They try to often give a lot of credit to Endless, too, which they're doing some good

523
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,220
work.

524
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,220
But let's be honest here.

525
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,900
A lot of it's coming from Canonical.

526
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,860
And I love their take on it.

527
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,860
God bless them.

528
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:58,820
They write, quote, the Red Hat team has focused on providing patch review and feedback and

529
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,700
working on bigger long term challenges and enablers.

530
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,700
Oh, boy.

531
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,700
Wow.

532
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,260
I mean, that's important, too.

533
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,420
Yeah, it is.

534
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:14,700
It also sounds like they are not leading a lot of the most important and aggressive development

535
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,980
in performance.

536
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,020
And instead, they're just sort of sitting back and enabling.

537
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:24,740
And I think you could argue, I think the definition of enabling could be argued.

538
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,740
But it's good to see all of the collaborative work on it.

539
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,820
And the results of that, which feels like it's been the story now for a Gnome release

540
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,740
or a few in a row, the results of which will materialize in Gnome 3.34.

541
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,740
Oh, boy.

542
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,500
Get ready for that.

543
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,300
And then last but not least, in the community news today, we have something that we need

544
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:49,700
to keep on the DL, because everybody knows security through obscurity is always the best

545
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,700
practice.

546
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,700
That's the only way to do it.

547
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,700
So you know what we've got to do, Wes?

548
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,900
We've got to bust out the cone.

549
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,900
The cone of silence.

550
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,860
OK, just between you and me.

551
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,860
Oh, yeah, super secret.

552
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,300
We're going to have a big change to WireGuard.

553
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,480
So the long and short of it is WireGuard's incredible.

554
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,180
We're using it all the time.

555
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,820
But it hasn't been mainlined yet.

556
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
No.

557
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,180
And it's because not enough zinc is in the Linux kernel.

558
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,180
No.

559
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,180
In fact, there's no zinc.

560
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,180
No zinc at all.

561
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,180
There's no zinc.

562
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,180
Zinc-free kernel since.

563
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,180
Yeah.

564
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,180
And that is essentially the crypto that WireGuard uses.

565
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:28,940
And the problem is that the upstream Linux kernel maintainers are not super keen on implementing

566
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,780
a new kernel level crypto.

567
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,820
They're just, I mean, especially adding it a whole bunch at once, right?

568
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,660
And this, even though it has been audited by a third party, this has been a pain point

569
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,060
that has prevented WireGuard from getting mainlined for multiple releases now.

570
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,140
It's almost become a meme on this show.

571
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:54,980
Well, all of this shifted on September 25, 2019, when Jason A. Dunfield, sorry, Jason.

572
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,100
Jason, the WireGuard creator.

573
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,600
And Jason writes, hi, folks, I'm at the Kernel Recipes conference now and got a chance to

574
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,080
talk with Dave M., a bit about WireGuard upstreaming.

575
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,180
His viewpoint has recently solidified.

576
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:15,100
In order to go upstream, WireGuard must port to the existing crypto API and handle zinc

577
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,980
separately.

578
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,340
He goes on to say, I've long resisted the idea of porting to the existing crypto API

579
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:26,300
because I think there are serious problems with it in terms of primitives, API performance,

580
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,580
and overall safety.

581
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,580
I didn't want to ship WireGuard in a form that I thought was suboptimal from a security

582
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,580
perspective since WireGuard is a security focused project.

583
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:41,880
But it seems that with us or without us, WireGuard will get ported to the existing crypto API.

584
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,140
So it's probably better we just fully embrace it and afterwards work evolutionarily to get

585
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,240
zinc into Linux piecemeal.

586
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,100
He goes on to say, I've ported WireGuard already several times as a proof of concept to the

587
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:59,380
API and I have a decent idea of the ways it can go wrong and generally how to do it the

588
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,140
least bad way.

589
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,140
All right.

590
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,140
So let's pause here.

591
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,060
We'll continue on for a moment because with all things Linux kernel development, there's

592
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,060
drama with this.

593
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:12,620
But before we get to the drama, let's talk about this.

594
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,600
Holy crap.

595
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,000
This is a huge change.

596
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,580
Zinc is sort of part of the secret sauce of WireGuard that makes it so damn fast.

597
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:27,240
And it seems to be a pretty purpose built, pretty good crypto that has been audited by

598
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,580
a third party.

599
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:34,300
So it kind of feels like we are settling for a substandard tech here just so that way we

600
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,860
don't upset the norm.

601
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:42,100
I grant that when you're dealing with security and crypto, it's a little bit different.

602
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,820
But I'm curious to know what you think, Wes, because you and I follow this pretty closely

603
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,300
for a little while now.

604
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:51,460
Yeah, I mean, I guess one way could be to merge Zinc and then adopt change kernel features.

605
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,740
But I think maybe a silver lining here is moving and adopting WireGuard.

606
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:00,260
I imagine that there'll be a number of comments about the problems in these patch sets as

607
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:05,540
they shift over and start using the existing APIs and presumably WireGuard contributors

608
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,300
complain about the problems with those APIs.

609
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,780
So that might see some improvements or at least help us decide how to properly bridge

610
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:18,740
between what exists and Zinc because Zinc did, while it seems to be great, did have

611
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,740
some overlap, right?

612
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:24,020
It is kind of confusing to have two crypto subsystems just existence in the kernel.

613
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,180
So I can understand some of the kernel developers reticence to just take this giant blob of

614
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,860
code, which isn't normally really how it goes, right?

615
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,980
They like to evolve the kernel over time.

616
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:38,340
Yeah, it makes sense when you're trying to keep stability and security.

617
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,740
I do appreciate the challenge there.

618
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,820
Where the drama comes in is David Miller or Dave M., which in the previous post, he's

619
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,620
the upstream maintainer of WireGuard for the Linux kernel.

620
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,580
And he writes, whoa, quote, I didn't say, quote, must anything.

621
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:57,020
I suggested this as more of a efficient way forward.

622
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:01,620
I'm a bit disappointed that you felt the need to so quickly make such an explosive posting

623
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:06,780
to the mailing list when we've just spoken about this amongst ourselves only 20 minutes

624
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,780
ago.

625
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,980
So, I mean, maybe this will or won't happen.

626
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,140
But if that's the maintainer's view, it does sound like it might be the easiest way forward.

627
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,420
And yeah, security is important, but at this point, I'm just tired of having to compile

628
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,580
the module every time I update my kernel, Chris.

629
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,500
I'm ready for a mainline WireGuard.

630
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,460
Even with DKMS, it's not enough.

631
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:31,340
Before you press send on any email and you're feeling emotional, just take five, you know?

632
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:37,660
Yeah, in fact, Jason, the WireGuard developer writes back and says, explosive?

633
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,900
That's certainly not the intent here.

634
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,340
The project is changing direction in a big way.

635
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,860
Collaborating with others on the crypto API will be an important part of that.

636
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:50,820
Announcing that change in direction, those intentions and rationale and why will be okay.

637
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:56,060
And then inviting collaboration is a responsible thing to do in the earliest opportunity.

638
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:01,980
Better to announce intent early rather than surprise people or deter potential collaborators

639
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,460
by keeping plans secret.

640
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,820
I kind of agree in this case.

641
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,820
I wonder, is this just a, you know, communication breakdown?

642
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,460
People normally speak over email and there is a kind of a, you know, it's difficult to

643
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,100
get the kernel to accept your, accept your work.

644
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,700
Seems like maybe Dave was having a conversation and Jason took that as a little more final

645
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,420
than Dave really meant it to be.

646
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:22,940
Well, and if you're going to rip out one of the, if you're going to just yank out zinc,

647
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,100
which is a key differentiator of that product, you probably want to give people a heads up

648
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,700
as fast as possible.

649
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,060
There's that too.

650
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,160
That's the community news.

651
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,860
So let's do a little housekeeping because we have some big things coming up.

652
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,660
AugCamp 19, just around the corner.

653
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,340
Mr. Wimpress will be there, won't you Wimpy?

654
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,520
I certainly will.

655
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,100
I'm looking forward to hearing everything that happens.

656
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,100
I am very jelly.

657
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:50,700
I'm not going, but Mr. Joe Resington will be there and there will be a panel, a podcast

658
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,700
panel.

659
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,340
That sounds like something we might like.

660
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,180
We got a theme going this episode with the alliteration.

661
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:01,420
It includes several of your internet favorites out there and they need your questions.

662
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,140
So we'll have a link about that in the show notes if you're in the area and you want to

663
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,140
hear several of your favorites.

664
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,140
Yeah.

665
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,140
You got questions for them.

666
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,140
Things you've always been dying to know.

667
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,140
Whatever they are.

668
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,140
Now's the time.

669
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,140
Let's get started.

670
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,140
Hosted by the internet's own Joe Resington.

671
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,140
Yeah.

672
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,900
See, that's the problem is he's not going to be answering the questions and that's,

673
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,260
that's what I want to ask.

674
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,260
That's true.

675
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,900
He is good at asking the questions though.

676
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,900
Oh, very good.

677
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,900
Hey, guess what?

678
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,380
New month, new free courses.

679
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,580
Elle just released a whole new batch of community courses.

680
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,980
The October free courses are here.

681
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,620
The big post is up over on the Linux Academy blog.

682
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:35,040
We have Alinkskies as always, but you can find it there as well.

683
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,060
There is a bunch of good stuff to get in there, including database administration and SQL

684
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,900
language basics.

685
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,500
If that's something you've struggled with before, Ansible playbook, deep dive.

686
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,980
If you need to learn Ansible and if you're wrapping your head around databases for the

687
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,500
first time, database essentials would be perfect for you.

688
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,860
There's also some stuff in there for Azure, Azure command line essentials and other free

689
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,860
courses.

690
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,500
And of course the community account is free as well.

691
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,220
Elle goes through and curates those every single month.

692
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,860
There's some that are persistent and some that are brand new every month.

693
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,860
I love that.

694
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,640
You know, it's kind of, we kind of get to sneak in there and take this content normally

695
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,020
costs money and boom, boom, free.

696
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,100
Wes and I are traveling next week.

697
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,940
We're going down to Texas cyber summit where we'll meet up with Al and Cheezy.

698
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,940
Oh yeah.

699
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,940
Oh yeah.

700
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,940
It's going to be a good show.

701
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,260
Texas cyber summit 2019.

702
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,460
You can win tickets.

703
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,820
We have a new winner, don't we?

704
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,360
Enrique is our latest winner.

705
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,620
We have two tickets left.

706
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,540
I think Al plans on giving out one of those tickets tomorrow.

707
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,620
Not sure exactly what time, but to enter, all you have to do is join the telegram.

708
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:46,660
Group, which is TCS2019.ellopunk.com link in the notes, join us and, uh, you'll be entered

709
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,660
to win.

710
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,140
And if you don't, if you can't come, you know, but, uh, we pick your name and we're going

711
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,180
to send out a little swag pack to you.

712
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,740
Um, so looking forward to seeing everybody there and it's, it seems to be stacking up.

713
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:05,220
I mean, I've, I've seen, uh, five or six people now from just the Texas, uh, Linux fest crew

714
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,220
that are showing up.

715
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,180
So it ought to be a really, uh, really interesting turnout and could be a good way to get a swag

716
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,180
back.

717
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,180
Absolutely.

718
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:17,420
And then of course, uh, there'll be the hacker family dinner and L and Allie's un-birthday

719
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,040
party at two brothers barbecue.

720
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,040
So join us for that.

721
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,300
We'll all sit down and have some barbecue and hang out, you know, do what we do in Texas,

722
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,300
right?

723
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,780
West and I land like the bosses that we are kind of late.

724
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,700
So if you want to come and see West and I angle towards the end of the dinner, we're

725
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,820
going to roll straight from the airport to the dinner.

726
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,820
We are.

727
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,820
Indeed.

728
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,820
We're going to be hungry.

729
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,820
You know?

730
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,820
Yeah.

731
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,820
We're going to want to eat the crap out of that barbecues.

732
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,820
We'll be on the plane all day long.

733
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,820
Okay.

734
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,780
Or you go early, we'll meet you there and then just make sure there's a lot of barbecue

735
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,780
already there.

736
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,780
Yeah.

737
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,780
Well, and then Carl, I think has vetted the barbecue.

738
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,260
He ate there like twice in one week.

739
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,260
It's Carl approved.

740
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,260
So wow.

741
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,260
That's a selfless act.

742
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,260
Isn't it?

743
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,260
It can't be that bad.

744
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:01,460
Just doing what I got to do, man.

745
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,500
So the unofficial hacker family dinner and un-birthday party, Wednesday, October 9th in

746
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,460
San Antonio details at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

747
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,420
Even if you're listening to this show after the fact, meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

748
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,540
is worth keeping your eye on because that is where we announce that kind of stuff and

749
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,980
we will do future meetups as well.

750
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,660
Let's check that out.

751
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,660
Texas in October.

752
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,660
There's worse places to go.

753
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,660
We'll see you there.

754
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,660
All right.

755
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:31,420
I have a question for everybody as we get into this part of the show, we're going to

756
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,420
get into our first steps after an install to make it just right.

757
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,340
But I'm curious to know how old y'all's install is right now.

758
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,780
Mr. Payne, we have a couple of commands that we'll link to in the show notes, but you ran

759
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,500
the old command skis there on your machine.

760
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,260
How old is your install right now?

761
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,060
I am one week away from a year with Neon.

762
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,060
All right.

763
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,060
Yeah.

764
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,060
Isn't that fun?

765
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,180
So actually while we're at the cyber summit, it'll be my Neon anniversary.

766
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,180
That's not bad.

767
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,480
I'm thinking that makes it a perfect time to mix things up too.

768
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,480
Now I've done my year.

769
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,480
I can say that I've tried it.

770
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
I've given it an honest try.

771
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
Right.

772
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,480
Time to change.

773
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,480
Yeah.

774
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Maybe it'll happen.

775
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,700
I bet somebody in the chat room will have a longer install date.

776
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:14,300
So chat room, feel free now to reveal your install dates in the chat room.

777
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,540
You can check my Twitter feed if you need a command on how to check your date.

778
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,060
Wimpy, have you ran this command?

779
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,380
Have you checked the, it's the current install you're on.

780
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,980
I mean, everybody has older installs, but the machine you're on right now.

781
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,980
Yeah.

782
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:31,080
So I'm in an interesting position in that I built this computer earlier in the year.

783
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:37,380
So my install date is March the 3rd, 2019, but that's days after I actually finished

784
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,540
building this brand new computer.

785
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,100
A nice fresh machine.

786
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,380
It's been upgraded through three versions of Ubuntu in that time.

787
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:49,460
So it was installed with 1810, it was upgraded to 1904 and it's now running 1910.

788
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,460
Naturally.

789
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,500
Of course, of course.

790
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:59,820
The system I'm sitting at here in the studio was installed on January 29th, 2018, which

791
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,260
is pretty good for us.

792
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,260
That's pretty good.

793
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,260
That is actually pretty good.

794
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,260
Mm-hmm.

795
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:11,940
My machine upstairs is February, 2018, 2018, 1804 was a game changer for me.

796
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:18,740
That was the OS that I just, I rebased every workstation I have on.

797
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:23,620
And the ones I installed, all these machines in the studio have the same install date because

798
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,620
they were all done on that day.

799
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,140
You know, there's something kind of enjoyable, I don't know if it's just because we've done

800
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:33,740
it for so long or the sort of spirit of installing Linux, but we don't even need to reinstall

801
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,740
that often, right?

802
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,660
I mean, like employees upgrades have gotten to be pretty darn good now.

803
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,580
And there are many times there's no problems with my machine, it's just fun to wipe it

804
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,160
and set it all up again.

805
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,600
And also installing Linux now is just so darned easy.

806
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
And quick.

807
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
That's true.

808
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,980
Alex, did you check the install date there on your machine?

809
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,120
Well, so I have two SSDs in the system.

810
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,580
So this Arch install is about three or four weeks old because I bought a new boot SSD,

811
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:04,340
but the Arch install before it, which technically is still bootable, which I'm going to count

812
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,100
is about 18 months old.

813
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,100
Okay.

814
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,100
Okay.

815
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,620
I think, I think we're going to find is the majority have pretty new installs.

816
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,620
I don't know what that says about us.

817
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,620
What about you Cheesy?

818
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,580
Did you have a chance to check the date of your install?

819
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,580
Yeah.

820
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:22,820
So my old MacBook that's running Pop OS was refreshed May 11th of 2019.

821
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:29,260
And then I've actually got the beta for Matei pulled down and I plan on putting on a test

822
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,260
machine later too.

823
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:34,380
So for me, it's one of those things that I always jump around, you know, just to see

824
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,380
what's out there.

825
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,380
And I don't know.

826
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,980
I mean, I guess I could check some raspberry pies around the house.

827
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,000
I'm sure they would have an older install date.

828
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,740
This is why WestK execs everywhere.

829
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,860
ByteBin, did you have a chance to check the date on your install?

830
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:52,140
Yeah, I seem to have a two year old and two months old install.

831
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,400
That's not bad.

832
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,140
That's actually pretty, pretty dang good.

833
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,140
What distro is that?

834
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,140
Solus.

835
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,780
I did not expect that.

836
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,780
Very nice.

837
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,780
But a nice one also.

838
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:11,180
I guess what was discussed on Jupiter broadcasting about two years and two months ago.

839
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,180
I'm going to say Solus.

840
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,180
I love that.

841
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,180
That's so great.

842
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,740
What about you, Brent?

843
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,820
Did you get a chance to check your workhorse?

844
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,140
Well, that lovely command you gave me didn't work because I'm on Arch, I guess, but I did

845
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:33,060
find a Cinchy file date and it corroborates with my memory, which is 2017 0314.

846
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,580
So that's kind of old.

847
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,580
Whoa.

848
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,580
Whoa.

849
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:43,940
And you're living proof that you can drive Arch daily.

850
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,940
Anybody else?

851
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,940
Can anybody else beat 2017?

852
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,620
I bet you that's the oldest install.

853
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,620
I can beat it.

854
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:56,860
I'm still on 1604, so it's 30th of June.

855
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:02,420
It's my desktop and my Windows environment is enlightenment, so I compiled it myself

856
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,420
on GitHub.

857
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:09,020
The software I need, I get some snaps and some PPAs, so why not?

858
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,900
We're only talking desktops here, right?

859
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:15,820
For the purposes of this, I'm thinking we're talking whatever machine you're sitting in

860
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:19,980
front of right now, because we've all got like maybe old boxes in a closet somewhere.

861
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,500
What I was wondering if you still had a droplet running Arch, West, can you get into that

862
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,500
box?

863
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,500
Yeah.

864
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,500
That would be fascinating.

865
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,500
West will attempt to get into that box.

866
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,500
That's a great, great question.

867
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,380
I have an idea from one time I looked.

868
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,380
We'll see.

869
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,380
We'll see.

870
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,420
Anybody else in the mumble room have a chance to check the date on their install?

871
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,420
Yeah.

872
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:42,740
Mine was Thursday, June 6th of this year on Ferran OS because I've been testing different

873
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,220
distros and it's on a new computer I built.

874
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,660
And you stuck with Ferran for a little bit now?

875
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,660
Yeah.

876
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,660
Well, I actually have three.

877
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:55,820
I have Ferran OS, Pop OS, and Ubuntu 18.04 on this machine.

878
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,140
So you're just distro hopping every day.

879
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,140
Yeah.

880
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,940
Some of us distro hop every few months.

881
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,660
Jill, she distro hops every day.

882
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,660
Yeah.

883
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,660
Okay.

884
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,660
Here we go.

885
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,660
All right.

886
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,660
The results are in.

887
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,660
Hold on.

888
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,660
Hold on.

889
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,660
You want to build a little suspense for this?

890
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,660
Here we go.

891
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,200
The box in the cloud running JBOT.

892
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,620
Which crashed during the show.

893
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,620
I will note.

894
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,620
Yes.

895
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,620
The file system was created Monday, April 1st, 2013.

896
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,620
Yes.

897
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,620
Yeah.

898
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,620
Wow.

899
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,620
Cool.

900
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,620
Whoa.

901
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:32,440
You can't run a rolling distro on a server though.

902
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,140
You cannot do it.

903
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,420
It just won't work.

904
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:40,780
It just won't work, especially not one that has a network and that is running server services.

905
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,780
You cannot do it.

906
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,460
I don't know about that, but you do certainly have to keep up with the update.

907
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,460
You do.

908
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,820
We haven't always been super great about that because one of the challenges is the Digital

909
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,820
Ocean pinned the kernel.

910
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:56,740
So that was a little bit tricky to work around and keeping it up to date meant that we eventually

911
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:00,380
broke the networking stack so it doesn't auto start when the system loads.

912
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:04,980
So it hasn't been perfect, but it has worked.

913
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,820
I think we're going to migrate off of that and just containerize that whole thing and

914
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,180
then throw it on something else.

915
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,520
But it almost seems like a fun challenge to take someone who thinks they're really good

916
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,260
or wants to learn Arch and then we'll let them upgrade it and see if they can get it

917
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,260
working from here.

918
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,260
It really is.

919
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:22,220
So that install date is impressive, but I hate to do this.

920
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,220
Uh-oh.

921
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,220
Hold on.

922
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,220
Can I do this?

923
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,220
Hold on.

924
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,220
I'll do this.

925
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,220
All right.

926
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,220
Go ahead, Wimpy, with the reveal.

927
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:38,980
The UbuntuPodcast.org server was installed in February 2006 and has been dist-upgraded

928
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:45,740
from 6.06 to 18.04 to 12.04 and is currently running 14.04 on ESM.

929
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,740
Wow.

930
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,780
That's a case study right there.

931
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,780
Right there.

932
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,740
You write that up as a case study.

933
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,700
That's a scientific experiment.

934
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,180
All right.

935
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,300
Well, that was a lot of fun.

936
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,140
So let's talk about what we do once we reload these machines because you can see we have

937
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,140
a mix here.

938
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,140
This is really fascinating.

939
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:09,480
We have the old boxes, and we also have some very, very fresh systems.

940
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,780
And I'm thinking my workstation upstairs is due for a reload.

941
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:19,460
It's been around since 2018, which isn't super long.

942
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,620
But I have desktop hopped instead of distro hop.

943
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:28,460
I love having all my stuff set up, my SSH keys, my GPG keys, all my configs.

944
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,700
And I've worked on exporting that out and making it synced or whatever.

945
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,780
But it took a while to get there.

946
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:44,100
And so in the meantime, I switched from Plasma to Gnome Shell to XFCE, and they got a lot

947
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,100
of baggage.

948
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:50,460
So I thought in the next round of releases come out, it's probably time to do a clean

949
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,460
install.

950
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:56,860
And I've thought about maybe using this as an opportunity to automate aspects of this.

951
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:00,540
That's something that I've talked to Alex about and something I've talked to Wes about,

952
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:06,140
trying to really go to the next level of making it a more efficient process.

953
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,780
So right now, I'll tell you guys what I do right now.

954
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,780
My current workflow is I get a new box, I get it installed.

955
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,780
First thing I got to do is I got to install Nextcloud and Syncthing.

956
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:20,500
Nextcloud for my work stuff, Syncthing for my personal stuff and my notes.

957
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,980
Then I got to get Firefox and Chrome, which I also then set up their respective syncing

958
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,980
services.

959
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:29,820
A lot of this stuff is pulling down configuration that's been stored off site.

960
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,540
So already you've got a whole bunch of files and all your browser stuff ready to go.

961
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,540
So that wasn't too bad.

962
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:40,820
Then I try to do things like I tweak my terminal size to make sure it's not really annoyingly

963
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,940
narrow.

964
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,580
I get gnome-tweak installed if I'm on Gnome Shell.

965
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,540
I install Fish Shell.

966
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:49,100
I add the minimize and maximize buttons to Gnome Shell if I got to.

967
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,380
I configure Dash to Dock.

968
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:53,220
If I'm on XFCE, I'll probably install ULauncher.

969
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,540
Got to set up a dark theme, obviously, get to that.

970
00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:02,460
Then I got to get my comms up, so I get Telegram, Slack, Mattermost, and email set up and configured.

971
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:07,260
Then if I'm on a desktop system, I've generally got what I call slash big, which I just take

972
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:13,260
a huge disk or like a J-Bot of disks and I just assign it to slash big, and that's where

973
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,580
like my project scratch is.

974
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:20,220
So if I want to do some drone footage or need to backup 15 distros off of Usenet and extract

975
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,340
them, that's where I have that space to just do something like that.

976
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,380
And if it's a laptop, I'm generally always now deploying WireGuard.

977
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:31,100
I'm always getting WireGuard set up and configured to link back to the studio.

978
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:35,940
And this is probably the things I do in like the first couple of hours of a new machine.

979
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:40,540
And I feel like some of these things could probably be automated, like the packages for

980
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:44,020
tasks, things like that could be done ahead of time.

981
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:49,220
We were just talking about the potential of like the systemd new portable home directory

982
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,740
idea, and that would fix some of this, not all.

983
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,900
So there's a kind of interesting split, right, you have some that's just like your user stuff,

984
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,300
it lives in your home, it's configuration for small applications, and you've got the

985
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,120
other part where you need to actually configure the system and make sure all the tools you

986
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,120
need are available.

987
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:07,840
All right, so let's see what folks in the virtual log are doing to see if they've solved

988
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,840
this problem.

989
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,980
MiniMech, do you have certain fundamentals you've got to go with and have you automated

990
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,180
their setup?

991
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,260
If you do, what are they and have you automated them?

992
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:21,820
I have not automated them, but on the desktop, it would be the mouse configuration, it will

993
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:28,740
be two programs, which is EMWheel and Easy Stroke, which is the mouse configuration for

994
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:34,660
scrolling wheels, tilt, left, right, and everything, because they are so crucial in my workflow.

995
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:42,260
Afterwards, installing software is easy, but to use the desktop, I'm so used to these two

996
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,220
programs that I can't leave, I can't miss them.

997
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,500
I know what you mean, I totally know what you mean.

998
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,860
I'm like that with you, Launcher, on Xfce, I got to have it.

999
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:55,260
Technav, if I recall, you have scripted some of this stuff for your got-to-haves.

1000
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:01,500
The programs I find that I use often, basically, I just wrote a simple batch script that just

1001
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:08,980
adds the necessary repositories, installs items, install Node and so forth, and once

1002
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:13,260
it gets through, pretty much I have most of what I need installed, and then from there,

1003
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,620
as I find new things, I just add on.

1004
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:19,940
You have a living batch script, essentially, that you add applications or version changes

1005
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:25,140
to, and then you just back that up and restore that, and that seems like a pretty good approach.

1006
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,300
And that might be the hardest part for you, I think, right?

1007
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,540
Because if you're going to do this, you either need a time to audit your past system and

1008
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:34,880
note what you need to actually add into your automation, or remember to update your automation

1009
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,140
each time you need to go make a change to your system.

1010
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:42,180
Or what's even more tricky, like desktops, Ubuntu, laptops, Fedora right now.

1011
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,300
And that gets a little messy.

1012
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,660
Alex, is this where you tell me I should use Ansible?

1013
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:48,140
Absolutely, it is.

1014
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,140
Yeah.

1015
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:52,500
Something Wes just said there struck a chord with me as well.

1016
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:57,420
So one of the principles I try to follow is something called infrastructure as code.

1017
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:02,900
And what this means is every single change you make, no matter how inconsequential, you

1018
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,060
make through automation.

1019
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:10,520
So everything lives in Git, every change is applied via Ansible, or any other config management

1020
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,980
tool, it doesn't have to be Ansible.

1021
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:17,260
So let's say you're updating your Samba config file and you want to change a single character,

1022
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:23,180
you change that file, commit it to Git, run the automation, or in a perfect world, there

1023
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:28,220
is some continuous integration server like Jenkins or something else doing it.

1024
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:32,420
And that works really well for servers, but for the desktop, it's possibly a little overkill.

1025
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:38,280
What if you are from a Windows background from yesteryear, like a roaming profile.

1026
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:44,520
So I restore that to my freshly installed machine, and I instantaneously have all of

1027
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:52,580
my configuration applied, all of my SSH keys, my VPN configuration, just everything is enabled.

1028
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:58,120
And I'm immediately in my familiar environment, you know, using the fish shell rather than

1029
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,840
bash and all of that stuff.

1030
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,780
So Martin, that sort of stuff sounds really appealing until I think to myself, well, what

1031
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,540
was the reason I reloaded this box?

1032
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:11,460
Was it to fix a screw up I made, or was it just to feel like I'm wearing a new pair of

1033
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,460
shoes?

1034
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,580
You know, that wonderful new shoe feeling.

1035
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,100
Sometimes I don't want to bring all that crud with me.

1036
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,220
How do you handle that?

1037
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:22,000
So Yadim is basically an interface that sits on top of Git.

1038
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,460
So it doesn't just check everything in that you do.

1039
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:31,380
You can selectively choose what you're checking into your portfolio of config and what have

1040
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,380
you.

1041
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:37,140
Just like Git, if you do check something in and you don't like it, you can revert it.

1042
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:42,780
So you know, you've got exactly the same semantics that Git has with Yadim in order to control

1043
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,680
what's in your profile.

1044
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,000
So it's very flexible.

1045
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:54,220
And then the other thing I use is a thing called direnv, which is direnv.net.

1046
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,860
And that's from the Nix project.

1047
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:03,400
And that's a mechanism by which I have projects in different directory structures and it automatically

1048
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:09,520
switches my environment context based on the directory I'm in.

1049
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:16,700
So when I'm in my development Debian directory, all of my GPG signing keys and email addresses

1050
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,660
and things that are used, you know, when you're packaging for Debian are all automatically

1051
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,100
switched to that context.

1052
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:27,700
And likewise, when I move to development Ubuntu, it all switches to development or development

1053
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,520
multi-desktop and so on.

1054
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,900
And that's a way to sort of not have to go through that craft each time.

1055
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:38,900
You just as you switch between projects, your world just reflects, you know, what and where

1056
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,900
you're working.

1057
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:40,900
It's beautiful.

1058
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:41,900
That is so beautiful.

1059
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,100
That's what I love about our Mumble Room.

1060
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:50,660
You know, this is, it's really like the wisdom of the community here.

1061
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,180
That's really great.

1062
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:57,820
I feel like I have so much to learn when it comes to this.

1063
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:01,260
I just, part of me loves trying it differently every time, too.

1064
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:05,540
So that's a bit of my resistance, but I think I'm getting past that.

1065
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:10,540
I think that era is coming to an end, but Carl, you use Ansible on the desktop, don't

1066
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,540
you?

1067
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:12,540
Yes, sir.

1068
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,820
Ansible has a deconf module that comes in real handy when you're trying to automate

1069
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:19,940
gnome settings and it even works for gnome extensions and also for mate mate too.

1070
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,940
All right.

1071
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,940
I'm sold.

1072
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,940
All right.

1073
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:23,940
All right.

1074
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:24,940
That's incredible.

1075
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,940
I didn't realize that.

1076
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:26,940
Okay.

1077
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:27,940
That kind of makes a lot of sense.

1078
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:30,100
This is something I'm going to invest some time in because I'm getting deeper and deeper

1079
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:34,620
into setting up services on the LAN and it's getting to a point now where it's not a lot

1080
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:39,420
of machines, but it is a lot of containers to manage and I could really, really, really

1081
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,940
use a simple way to just get everything stood right back up if something were to fail on

1082
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:44,940
it.

1083
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,380
It's kind of fun when you're doing it bespoke each time on your laptop, but when it's things

1084
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:51,580
you actually need just as a functional device, well, it gets old fast.

1085
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,820
So Chris, imagine this as a panacea.

1086
00:53:53,820 --> 00:54:00,640
You know that lovely Pi 4 that you have running WireGuard on there connecting to each network

1087
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,080
that you have at the studio in the RV.

1088
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,700
Maybe if you are in Texas, you have a couple of machines down there, right?

1089
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:12,940
And you can push a change to all of your machines with a single command using Ansible over WireGuard.

1090
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:13,940
Wouldn't that be amazing?

1091
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:14,940
Yes.

1092
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,860
Oh, I want to do that.

1093
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:17,860
Can I do that?

1094
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:18,860
Is there anything I can do, Alex?

1095
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:19,860
We can do that.

1096
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:24,900
Yeah, that sounds like the territory of the self-hosted show in the near future.

1097
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:30,820
I've been building some really amazing services and infrastructure on freaking Raspberry Pi

1098
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:31,820
4s, to be clear.

1099
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:34,380
I would never have believed it.

1100
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:35,380
I wouldn't have either, Wes.

1101
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:37,740
I really, truly wouldn't have.

1102
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:41,820
And we're going to talk a little about my setup on the self-hosted show, but that stuff

1103
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:46,180
has really gotten me thinking about just biting this automation bullet, just solving this

1104
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,180
problem once and for all.

1105
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:50,740
It's something I've been putting off for a ridiculously long time.

1106
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,820
I just got to solve it.

1107
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,540
We'll drag you into this century yet.

1108
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,540
Come on in.

1109
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,540
The water's lovely and warm.

1110
00:54:55,540 --> 00:55:00,260
I refuse, and that's why Cheese has the perfect app pick for me this week.

1111
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:04,860
It's Telegram, but in Python and on the console.

1112
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:05,860
Yeah.

1113
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:12,440
So before I had consolidated everything into the cloud, I was running a lot of the stuff

1114
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:18,980
on single-board computers, and so I would just SSH into the box and Curses all the

1115
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:19,980
things.

1116
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,900
So TTY clock, and Curses Telegram client.

1117
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,900
So if you want to get your Telegram on, you can do that.

1118
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:33,980
It even appears to have some awesome ASCII art instead of photos.

1119
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:36,660
So the photos will be displayed in ASCII art.

1120
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,660
Yeah.

1121
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:38,660
Inline images, kind of.

1122
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:39,660
Yeah.

1123
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:40,660
Which is great, man.

1124
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:41,660
You've got to love that.

1125
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:45,980
So if you're looking for just a simple way to tie into your Telegram and get your Telegram

1126
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,220
fix on the command line, check it out.

1127
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,500
Something tells me Levi looks cute even in ASCII.

1128
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,580
I bet you that's true.

1129
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,580
I guarantee it.

1130
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:53,580
All right.

1131
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:57,740
And then for a bonus pick round, Mr. Martin Wimpress is coming in with a bonus app pick

1132
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,740
this week.

1133
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,740
What is it, Wimpy?

1134
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:03,400
So my app pick is CPUX.

1135
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,500
So are any of you familiar with CPUZ on Windows?

1136
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:12,020
Is that like the tool that gives you all of the cool information about your CPU?

1137
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,020
Yes.

1138
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:22,660
So CPUX is basically CPUZ for Linux, and I'll paste links in the IRC in just a moment.

1139
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,120
It's been around for a while.

1140
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:29,700
Some of the distributions have it in the archives, but I've been working on helping introduce

1141
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,660
this package into the Debian and Ubuntu archives.

1142
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:39,460
And I've got a PPA for Ubuntu Disco and Eon, that's 1904 and 1910 for people that want

1143
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,620
to have a play.

1144
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:48,140
But it is as excruciatingly detailed about your CPU, cache, motherboard, memory, system

1145
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:51,500
and graphic configuration as CPUZ is on Windows.

1146
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,940
It's still a bit of kit.

1147
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:57,540
I have used this before, but it is sometimes a bit of a pain in the butt to get it working

1148
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,580
on a more recent distro.

1149
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:03,980
So if you're working on the packaging side of this, I'm all in, that's great.

1150
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:08,620
I just installed it on Arch in the space of time it took me to Wimpy to tell us about

1151
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:09,620
it.

1152
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,620
And it works just fine, Chris.

1153
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,620
Get on with it.

1154
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,620
By the way, did you guys know that Alex is using Arch?

1155
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:13,620
You know, I might've heard that.

1156
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:19,020
Yeah, I think he may have told us.

1157
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:25,660
That's a great, that is one of those app picks that I have this category of tools that are

1158
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,380
my favorite tools that I have forgotten to mention enough.

1159
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,380
And that is one of them.

1160
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,700
They're just so reliable sitting there at the bottom.

1161
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:35,940
It's when I'm reviewing a laptop or a desktop and I'm not intimately familiar, it's such

1162
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:40,020
a great tool for me to just understand some of the most important bits about a machine

1163
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,280
and tell me where to start.

1164
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,900
When I was overclocking the CPU and motherboard on this thing, it's got a prime 95 generator

1165
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,900
built in.

1166
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:52,120
So you can use that to sort of test the stability of your overclock and make sure everything's

1167
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,120
performing well.

1168
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:57,020
So it's a real useful bit of kit.

1169
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:03,420
I've found a few interesting bits of software, which you could describe as software for risers

1170
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:09,860
that I'm working on bringing to Debian and Ubuntu over the coming weeks and months.

1171
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:10,860
I support this.

1172
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:11,940
I will buy you a beer.

1173
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,300
I support this.

1174
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:18,180
CPUX has a wonderful app image that works really well.

1175
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:21,020
I've been using that on all my different distros.

1176
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,020
You've got to be kidding me.

1177
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,020
Yes.

1178
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,020
Thank you.

1179
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,020
Oh my God.

1180
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,020
I never even checked.

1181
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:31,020
Unfortunately, app image does not come, I think Snap and Flatpak, but I don't often

1182
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,020
think app image.

1183
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,020
All you do is download it, man.

1184
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,020
Yeah.

1185
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,020
I should check it.

1186
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,020
All right.

1187
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,020
Good to know.

1188
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,020
Good to know.

1189
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,460
Well, it's getting easier and easier for us to run software these days.

1190
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:44,940
That's truly, it has been one of my favorite things about, it's been in the works for years,

1191
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:50,660
but I feel like I really appreciate and realize that in 2019, it is easier than ever for me

1192
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:55,460
to pick whatever distro, whatever desktop and still get all the software I want.

1193
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:58,520
But app image and Snaps and Flatpaks are a big part of that.

1194
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:02,520
So it's pretty awesome to be a Linux user these days.

1195
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:06,860
If you want to get more Martin Wimpress, go check out Ubuntu Podcast.

1196
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:12,260
A brand new fresh version just came out just a few days ago, and it's worth a good listen

1197
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:17,260
where Wimpy had a good take on a few things like we talked about earlier in the show.

1198
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:21,700
So extended coverage on some of these topics in that episode of Ubuntu Podcast.

1199
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,700
Thanks for making it, Wimpy.

1200
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,340
It was good to see you and hear you.

1201
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:25,340
Thank you for having me.

1202
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,340
It's been delightful.

1203
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:30,420
Now, obviously, Mumble Room, we appreciate all of you for being here.

1204
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:34,460
You all are very great, and our Mumble Room is open to anyone in the community.

1205
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:40,220
We will have a brief mic check to make sure that you've got a microphone, and we also

1206
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:41,460
would like you to have headphones.

1207
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,500
But don't worry, we're friendly about it.

1208
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:47,780
And push to talk, so that way it's amenable for on-air production.

1209
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:51,220
That's really all it takes, and then you can jump in the conversation about the topics

1210
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:54,100
that we cover and sometimes influence the cover of the show.

1211
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,260
Help us make the show better.

1212
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,540
Yeah, we really do appreciate it.

1213
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,980
So you can get information about that in our IRC room.

1214
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:05,860
Go to irc.geekshed.net, pound Jupiter Broadcasting, hashtag, hashtag, I should say, not pound,

1215
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:06,860
hashtag, hashtag.

1216
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:07,860
Octothorp.

1217
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:08,860
Thank you.

1218
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:09,860
Thank you.

1219
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:10,860
You knew what I wanted.

1220
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:11,860
I got you.

1221
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:12,860
Thank you.

1222
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,940
I do like the Octothorp.

1223
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:20,180
You can also just Google Jupiter Colony Mumble, as well as participate in our chat room during

1224
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,180
the show.

1225
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,260
We do it all on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv.

1226
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:28,780
Tuesdays at 2 p.m. Pacific, although the stream usually gets started about a half hour, 45

1227
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:29,780
minutes.

1228
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:30,780
It's making early.

1229
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,780
There's a lot more show.

1230
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,540
Then there's some post-show.

1231
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:35,540
Some of it makes it into the edit.

1232
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:36,540
Most of it don't.

1233
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:42,900
jblive.tv for that, JupiterBroadcasting.com slash calendar for your time zone, and LinuxUnplugged.com

1234
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:47,780
slash, get ready for this, three, two, one, for all of our links.

1235
01:00:47,780 --> 01:01:03,100
See you next Tuesday.

1236
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:30,300
Well, we had that whole alliteration theme this episode for at least 70% of the show.

1237
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,140
I feel like our title should have some of that in it.

1238
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:33,140
It definitely should.

1239
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:34,140
You know?

1240
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:39,860
Well, before the show, we were debating doing some Raspberry Pi 4 coverage, which there's

1241
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,580
going to be plenty of coming up on the network in the next week or so.

1242
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:48,380
So we thought, you know, maybe not, but we've been trying various different distributions

1243
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:52,980
and Wimpy, I don't know if you've seen this, but there is some bloke out there has an unofficial

1244
01:01:52,980 --> 01:02:00,340
current build of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for the Raspberry Pi with a bunch of the Raspbian

1245
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:06,540
kernel patches and drivers and whatnot applied to his, whatever you want to call it, image

1246
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:07,740
of 18.04.

1247
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,640
I am aware.

1248
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:14,260
And there's a group of people for CentOS that are essentially doing the same thing.

1249
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:18,260
The CentOS community came along and said, all right, well, let's see what you did here.

1250
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:21,940
And they've rolled some of that into CentOS 7.7.

1251
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:26,100
But the results are so far a little hit and miss, eh Cheesy?

1252
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:30,500
Yeah, so I've put 7.7 on a Pi 3.

1253
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,480
It's 32-bit only.

1254
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,480
It does work.

1255
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:43,420
I have had some segment faults and I had it just basically die on me whenever I was trying

1256
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:46,580
to install today's app pick.

1257
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:49,480
So I think there's still some work to be done there.

1258
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:54,540
There currently isn't a 64-bit image, at least not on the site for CentOS.

1259
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:59,820
So I'll try it again later on whenever I feel like it's maybe matured a little bit more.

1260
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,460
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

1261
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:02,860
It's going to take some time.

1262
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:13,140
I didn't quite fully appreciate how married the Raspberry Pi 4 would be to Raspbian initially.

1263
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:17,340
But if you want to do firmware updates on the Raspberry Pi, you need Raspbian.

1264
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:23,380
If you want full video decoding and all full driver support, you need Raspbian.

1265
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:28,340
My Pi 4, which sat on my desk all week, I've actually been playing with it all show.

1266
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:33,300
It's booting now off a USB SSD, I mean, slash boot's still on the SD card, but everything

1267
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,700
else is on the USB SSD.

1268
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:39,460
And it's slower to boot from the SSD by six seconds.

1269
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:40,460
Would you believe that?

1270
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:41,460
What?

1271
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:46,060
Wes and I were just this morning talking about setting up essentially Raspbian on the SSD

1272
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:51,980
with grub configured to boot another distro, I mean, not an SSD, but with grub on the SD

1273
01:03:51,980 --> 01:04:00,340
or the micro SD card pointing to an OS on a USB 3 SSD, like CentOS or Ubuntu or something

1274
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,340
else.

1275
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,340
Exactly what I'm doing here.

1276
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:07,140
And I'm getting on DD, I'm just trying to do some basic benchmarking.

1277
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:11,580
I was getting about 10 to 15 megs a second to the SD card.

1278
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:17,660
I am seeing 144 to the SSD, which so there is some improvement, but installing packages

1279
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:20,220
wasn't as lightning as I hoped.

1280
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:23,380
What SD card do you have on that thing?

1281
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:28,140
It's the one that came with my Mavic Pro, so it's like a SanDisk Gold 16 gig thing or

1282
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:29,140
something.

1283
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:30,140
You'd think it'd be somewhat decent.

1284
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:36,700
I just put a Samsung Super Speed one in there and I'm getting around 80 megabytes to the

1285
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:37,700
SD card.

1286
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:38,700
It's still slower.

1287
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,100
You see that's up there with a mechanical hard drive.

1288
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,100
Yeah, exactly.

1289
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:45,260
Which I also tested and you get about 80 or 90 meg on a mechanical drive.

1290
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,060
It's not quite fast enough, though.

1291
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:48,900
It's not quite.

1292
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,060
And Raspbian is fine.

1293
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:52,060
It's actually-

1294
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:54,180
I like watching you say this.

1295
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:57,660
You struggle, but it's weird to have that limitation.

1296
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,220
I mean, not even a strict limitation, right?

1297
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:05,060
But it's so much more of a platform and we're used to the generic x86 world.

1298
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,060
Yes.

1299
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:07,060
You're buying a platform.

1300
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:09,720
You're buying a product on a platform and that's fine.

1301
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:10,720
It's good.

1302
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,720
Raspbian is fine.

1303
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:12,720
It's all good.

1304
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:18,400
It's just not the OS I have in production anywhere else in the world and never would

1305
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,640
for any reason.

1306
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:24,260
So it's like would be great if I could also run-

1307
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:26,060
You're saying we're switching the studio to Raspbian?

1308
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:27,060
No.

1309
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:28,060
Never going to happen, right?

1310
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:29,180
It's never going to happen.

1311
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:34,720
So now I always have to have some one-off boxes and I guess it's okay.

1312
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,720
It's fine.

1313
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,060
You know, it's fine.

1314
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:38,940
Your lament is duly noted.

1315
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:39,940
Yes.

1316
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:41,240
Thank you.

1317
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,580
Thank you.

1318
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:46,100
Maybe I'm just complaining because you know what?

1319
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:51,100
Thankfully they do make a Raspbian Lite version available, which makes it a perfect little

1320
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:55,840
headless system that gets great updates and runs containers just as well as any other

1321
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,060
distro runs containers.

1322
01:05:57,060 --> 01:06:01,220
So at the end of the day, I can't really complain that much because it's working for me.

1323
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:07,180
But I don't know, I guess I had this idea in my head that I was buying a 64-bit sort

1324
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,360
of general ARM computer.

1325
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:13,460
Not that it's not a product, but that it's so well known that I could just slam almost

1326
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:16,100
anything on it and that hasn't been the case.

1327
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,260
It is the case with like the Pi 3.

1328
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:22,260
I can pretty much put any distro on there I want and be happy, but I didn't anticipate

1329
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:24,060
this lag with the Pi 4.

1330
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:25,060
Yeah.

1331
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:29,100
Well, it's a similar amount of lag we saw when the Pi was first introduced.

1332
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:34,180
You know, it took some time for the other distributions to ramp up and you know, get

1333
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:35,180
their game on.

1334
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:37,020
So, you know, it's a new beast.

1335
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:39,380
It's not an evolution of what's come before.

1336
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:41,900
It's an entirely different bit of kit.

1337
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:47,900
So and as you've pointed out, there is a whole load of bring up that needs to be done in

1338
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,100
a very different way.

1339
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,100
Yeah.

1340
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,460
That's what's hard to appreciate from afar.

1341
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:52,640
And now I understand that.

1342
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,340
And that said, I just got another two Raspberry Pis, which I have projects already planned

1343
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:57,340
for and I'm ready to go.

1344
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:58,340
I'm good with it.

1345
01:06:58,340 --> 01:06:59,820
I understand that now.

1346
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:02,900
I just think that if I hadn't bought it yet, I would have appreciated to have a better

1347
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:07,620
understanding of that, which isn't made very clear really anywhere in any reviews.

1348
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:08,620
There's kind of a split, right?

1349
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:12,580
Like a lot of this stuff is focused on people just getting into computers or Linux, not

1350
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:15,100
power users who hosted Linux podcasts.

1351
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:19,380
They'll want to set up like eight different servers, services on their homeland on a Raspberry

1352
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:24,660
Pi 4, which I would, you know, really before the Raspberry Pi 4, I would have kind of just

1353
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:26,220
considered these to be toys.

1354
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:31,180
And now things kind of just shifted when I got four gigs of RAM and I got four CPU cores

1355
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:35,100
and I got dedicated gigabit ethernet and Wi-Fi on its own bus.

1356
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:39,260
It's like you were excited about it as a maybe potential desktop, but really it's become

1357
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:40,260
your new server platform.

1358
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:41,260
Yeah, it's not.

1359
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:42,260
It's not a great desktop platform yet.

1360
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:45,420
It's definitely usable and serviceable, but it's not there for me.

1361
01:07:45,420 --> 01:08:06,020
And as a server, it's there.
