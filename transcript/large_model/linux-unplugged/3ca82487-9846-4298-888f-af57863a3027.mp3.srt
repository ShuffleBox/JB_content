1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Okay, alright, so I was gonna ask if you guys, before we get started, before we get into

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,800
all the serious Linux discussion, all Linux content all the time, did you see IT, cards

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,420
against IT, that's what it's called, cards against IT, I'm such a spaz.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,000
Cards against IT, you're familiar with cards against humanity, so like here's the white

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,560
cards rotating the backup, a PCAP, RM-RF, my rooted phone, and then you go down to of

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:31,900
course the actual phrases, the new IT director has a sick tattoo of blank, the last consultant

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,640
was fired over blank, forgetting the blank in the data center is a firing offense, nothing

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,320
transfers data faster than blank, so it's, yeah, blank is a layer 8 of the OSI networking

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,100
model, we're going to use blank instead of updating to IPv6, blank is the last stage

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,880
of our blank rollout, these are good, if you've been in the industry for a while, these are

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,440
all pretty good, so I recommend if you want to blow off a little steam, you go print this

12
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,560
out, we'll have the PDF and the show notes, it's just the same kind of like spirit of

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,820
cards against humanity, but it's cards against IT.

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:20,160
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 109 for September 8th, 2015.

15
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,560
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that really, really needs a shower.

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,560
My name is Chris.

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,560
My name is Wes.

18
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:34,960
Hey Wes, so I'm sorry if I stink a little bit, I've taken showers recently, but not

19
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,960
like today.

20
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,960
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,400
I'm going to sit as far away as possible over here.

22
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,560
Yeah, that's cool, you can scoot the mic away, it's alright, actually, I'll tell you more

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,120
about that in a little bit, but we have a really great show coming up, some feedback

24
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,080
we've got to start with from the community that touches on a couple of topics we've been

25
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,320
following for a couple of weeks, and then I want to jump into this convergence demo of

26
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,760
some pretty performance-demanding applications running under Exmere, yeah, desktop open GPL

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,720
applications running under Mere.

28
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
Whoa.

29
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,640
Yes, yes, Exmere being pushed a limit, we're going to talk about that, and then also, did

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,700
you see this headline, Wes, how Debian is trying to shut down the CIA and make software

31
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,920
trustworthy again?

32
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
I sure did.

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
That's a hell of a title.

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,480
It sure is, dramatic, but important work.

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,680
Yeah, we're going to talk about what that actually is, why the Debian project wants

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,240
reproducible builds, see if I can say it, if I can reproduce the words, and why other

37
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,720
projects are probably going to be picking that up, including FreeBSD, NetBSD, and maybe

38
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,840
some other Linuxes, we'll be talking about that in just a little bit, and then, towards

39
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,120
the end of the show, I'm going to do my darnedest to convert Wes back to Gnome, because I'm

40
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,520
going to tell him what is so badass about Gnome 3.18 that's not even in the release

41
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
notes.

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Oh, no.

43
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,840
And we might just get you to switch to Gnome by the end of this episode, Wes.

44
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
I'll be the judge.

45
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Yeah, right.

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
Okay.

47
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,580
So, why don't we get into a little bit of business, some follow-up and some show-specific

48
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,360
stuff before we launch into the rest of the episode.

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,680
The first thing I want to do right here at the top of the show is give a plug to an old

50
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,900
friend of the show, Mr. Matt Hartley, for launching Freedom Penguin, which you can find

51
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,840
at freedompenguin.com, and one of the cool things he's doing is he's brought on some

52
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,600
friends, other friends of the show.

53
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,600
You guys are familiar with Albert Westra, Odyssey Westra, who joins us frequently, and

54
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,280
of course you're also familiar with Jed.

55
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,680
He contributes a lot via email and subreddits and our online community aspects.

56
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,320
Now there are, and also Joe Collins is writing over there, now working with Matt on Freedom

57
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,760
Penguin, freedompenguin.com, so that was Matt's project that he was working on for a while,

58
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,920
and it's been in the works since he stepped down from Linux Unplugged, and now it is here

59
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,460
and kicking, and you can check it out at freedompenguin.com.

60
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,460
Very exciting.

61
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,460
Yeah.

62
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,460
Nice to see some new stuff from Matt.

63
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,240
I bet if you're a solid contributor, too, I bet you he's looking for contributors.

64
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
I would guess.

65
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,320
I would guess.

66
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,040
So along that same bit of line of thinking, why don't we also say hello to somebody special.

67
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,040
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

68
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,900
No, not Mr. Leo Leport, our new co-host on the show officially, Mr. Wes.

69
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,500
Wes, remind me of your last name.

70
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,560
My last name is Payne, P-A-Y-N-E, Chris.

71
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,320
Oh yeah, look at that right there on my screen, right there.

72
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
It's right there on my screen.

73
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
You'd think I'd know that.

74
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
It's just right there.

75
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,320
I like that.

76
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,160
When I heard Payne, I thought, well, that's a pretty good last name.

77
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
Well, thank you.

78
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,080
Now, I would go just for your on-air persona, P-A-I-N, you know, just go for it.

79
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
I mean, just own it.

80
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
Pick it up a level.

81
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Yeah, really, because it's a DJ name.

82
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,440
You've got to have a DJ name.

83
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,960
So Wes is going to be joining Linux Unplugged officially as the co-host going forward, which

84
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,040
is great because when I'm on the road trip, Wes will be here in studio and he'll have

85
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,700
local audio and hopefully I'll have local audio.

86
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,920
Show should still sound great even when I'm on the road, but it'll be nice having somebody

87
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,280
here that can physically push the record button and make sure we get the show out and things

88
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,280
like that.

89
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,160
Yeah, we'll hopefully have an editor coming on, another editor, to help put it all together

90
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
when we're on the road.

91
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,240
But yeah, so Wes, I'm super glad to have you here and congratulations to Matt for launching

92
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,940
Freedom Penguin and we have a heck of a show to get into.

93
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,240
So before we go any further, why don't we bring in the next critical piece of the show.

94
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,320
That's our mumble room.

95
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,120
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

96
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
Hello.

97
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
Hello.

98
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,120
Hello.

99
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
Hello.

100
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Hey, guys.

101
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
A great showing.

102
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Whoa, whoa.

103
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,120
All right, so I wanted to know right off the top, are you guys all ready for a system

104
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
D killer?

105
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,240
We have a brand new one, ladies and gentlemen.

106
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,080
I want to bring it into the show before we go any further right here.

107
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
It's super important.

108
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,440
I present to you, and Wes, you help me with the official pronunciation because otherwise

109
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,200
I'm going to say System 16?

110
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,260
I guess so.

111
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,740
System X V1?

112
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,740
What do you call this one?

113
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,740
It's a V?

114
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,740
Yeah, yeah.

115
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,760
So System 16 is a modern take on service management.

116
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,440
It aims to incorporate useful functionality while maintaining a modular design in the

117
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,680
Unix tradition.

118
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,520
System 16 uses KBuild as used by VirtualBox.

119
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,680
There are minimal dependencies you need, like a proc CPS and a lib KQ, I'm sorry, in the

120
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,400
development formats, and then you just install your distros package for KBuild, and you can

121
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,620
run KMK, and you are good to go.

122
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,760
It's free software.

123
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,600
It's licensed under GPL3, and it's here to replace System D. And you know what?

124
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,840
I'll tell you one thing that's got way better than System D, that logo.

125
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
Yeah.

126
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
System D don't got that.

127
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
No.

128
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Colorful, bright.

129
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
I love it.

130
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
Does it have any example configuration files?

131
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,840
Yeah.

132
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,200
You can play on System 5, and obviously, but it's pretty, it's just the System D alternatives,

133
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
they never end.

134
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,520
I would, I dare someone, I challenge someone in the Mumble Room to run this.

135
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Anybody want to take it?

136
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Anybody want to try it?

137
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,000
Like, got a throwaway rig you could try this on?

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,160
Well, given the only result I find on Google for this is a 4chan thread, no, probably not.

139
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Damn.

140
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
You got me.

141
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,160
Okay.

142
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
All right.

143
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
Very good, very good.

144
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,000
Let's move on to the feedback then.

145
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,440
So actually, can I deviate, Wes, you know, can I get Wes?

146
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,480
So Wes got here a little early today, and so we went out to lunch, and Wes has had to

147
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,040
have already heard, unfortunately, quite a bit of this, but I want to share my weekend

148
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,620
just really quickly with you guys.

149
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:04,420
So Friday, right after the Linux Action Show wrapped up, I took the trailer out camping,

150
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,000
and I went boondocking, quote unquote.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Boondocking?

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,800
Boondocking is when you're dry camping, you're off the grid.

153
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,940
So all I had was my Dell XPS 13 with me, and I had my S6 with me, and that was pretty solid

154
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,940
for two nights.

155
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,600
I lived off the camper's batteries, lived off the tanks, the propane, the water tanks,

156
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:28,800
and I was able to get data connectivity using my XPS just tethered to, or actually hotspot,

157
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
to the S6.

158
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,880
It worked okay.

159
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,840
But I wanted to live like a king, and my trailer came as part of the whole deal I got.

160
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,160
I inherited a Thousand Trails membership, which I didn't really know anything about that,

161
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,960
but it turns out it's like a campsite you can go take advantage of without having to

162
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,000
pay anything.

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,640
So for the last couple of nights, I've been hooked up on the beach with water, and sewer,

164
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
and power.

165
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Look at that spot.

166
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,640
It's beautiful.

167
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,280
Yeah, it's a very quaint town called La Conner in Washington that I've been living out in

168
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,560
the trailer, just getting it ready.

169
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,360
And the whole idea is wrap my head around what it's like, because I have to live in

170
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,920
this thing for 17 days, but the thing is, I don't just have to live in this thing.

171
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:13,080
I have to work in this too, and I need to understand what I'm up against, and I can't

172
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,160
be always learning absolutely everything while I'm also working and traveling, right?

173
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,840
And wanting to also have some downtime.

174
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:27,800
So I've been spending so far the entire weekend, since I got off the air, in the rig, out there,

175
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,800
trying different things out, and I'm living like a king right now.

176
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,060
I really love it.

177
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,840
And so I'm trying to get my head around the road trip, really excited about how things

178
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
are coming together.

179
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,560
Zach the Penguin writes in, and he said, hi, I was listening to Unplugged today and I figured

180
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,220
I'd make some suggestions to name the road show.

181
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,060
How about Nation Migration, March of the Penguins, or Roll Your Own?

182
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,060
Just a few ideas.

183
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,060
Hope it helps.

184
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,120
I don't know if any of those are resonating with me specifically, but I thought they were

185
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,120
good.

186
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
So I want to keep the ball rolling.

187
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,000
If anybody has any names, we've got to name the road trip something.

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,720
Like today, we're trying to figure out how we're going to do live tracking so you guys

189
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,520
can see where I'm at so we can do meetups and you can suggest where I go and stuff like

190
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
that.

191
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,440
We're going to try to have live tracking during the trip, but we still don't have a name for

192
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
it.

193
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
Can't track until you have a name for it.

194
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Got to say what you're tracking.

195
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
Very important.

196
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,440
Very important.

197
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
So I need ideas.

198
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,440
I need ideas for the road show.

199
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
The Penguinator?

200
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
I don't know.

201
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
I don't think so.

202
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Not punny enough, really.

203
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
Yeah.

204
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
I do like that.

205
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Now it does have a bird on it.

206
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
It has a jaybird on it.

207
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Okay.

208
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Because it's a Jayco trailer.

209
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,120
And so I was thinking something to do with the bird is in there.

210
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,300
There's something there.

211
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,920
But I was thinking that might be the name for the trailer, but the trip itself.

212
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
The show has its own.

213
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,320
Because there could be multiple road trips.

214
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,940
So we need to be able to differentiate the different road shows.

215
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,940
The journey to Jupiter.

216
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,720
Well, because there could be future trips.

217
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
So we got to...

218
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
We got to start with the journey to Mars.

219
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
No, that doesn't make sense.

220
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,680
What happens when I run out of plan is when I stop taking road trips, we need a bigger

221
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
solar system.

222
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,480
The final destination, well, so for those of you who are not familiar, I'm going to

223
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Grand Forks, North Dakota.

224
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,400
I'm going to do a show of Linux, an episode of Linux action show at Noah's house.

225
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,640
Try to get a last Cribs episode in, something we committed to a while ago.

226
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,800
And then meander my way, meander down to Utah and visit a few national parks down there

227
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,320
and then make my way back up.

228
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,040
Linux road show seems too obvious.

229
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,160
Seems too obvious.

230
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,160
Forking Jupiter.

231
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
Jupiter ascending.

232
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
Okay.

233
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
I don't want to get copyright takedowns.

234
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,160
All right.

235
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,440
So then let's move on to the next email that is maybe a bit more appropriate for feedback.

236
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,280
Sean writes in about Jose, who wrote in about his MacBook.

237
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,520
He says, I've been running Linux on my MacBook Pro for about four years now.

238
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,800
I just switched back to Fedora 22 from OpenSUSE.

239
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,840
I've been rocking SUSE since 2007 and my MacBook has never worked better.

240
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,080
Now he's on Fedora 22 and he says, he thinks it's because it has kernel 4.1.

241
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,840
It's finally given me good hardware support for the keyboard backlight, the thermal fan

242
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,160
controls, CPU scaling, and the battery life is better.

243
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,320
One thing that I've done to extend battery life is buy the Fluendo codec suite and switch

244
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,960
to Gstreamer based video player.

245
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,400
The Fluendo codecs have much better video acceleration for video decoding, taking the

246
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
load off of the CPU.

247
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,320
Well, that's a good tip.

248
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,400
Also, not all Gstreamer video players are created equal.

249
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,360
Totem is still pretty heavy on the CPU, 24% when playing a 1080p HD 64 video, but streaming

250
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:09,040
something lightweight like MPV sits around 12% and this is on a Sandy Bridge i5.

251
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,160
I haven't tried Arch on here yet, but I imagine getting a similar setup wouldn't be too hard.

252
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,960
I wish Jose the best of luck.

253
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Don't give up on Linux.

254
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,720
Well, that's really cool.

255
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,240
If 4.1 brought in thermal fan control, holy crap.

256
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
That's a huge deal.

257
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,040
I think MacBooks are definitely one of those areas where you get to see the exciting march

258
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,000
of kernel progress in terms of hardware support.

259
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah.

260
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,520
I actually surprised tech this long considering that Linus uses a MacBook Air.

261
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,520
You know what I mean?

262
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
Yeah.

263
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,520
That is surprising.

264
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
Yeah.

265
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
Yeah.

266
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
All right.

267
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,520
So Mumbo, did you guys have any ideas for a roadshow name?

268
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,520
Nobody?

269
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,520
Come on.

270
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,240
Everybody's got to have something very punny and quippy, no?

271
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,800
Well Chris, you know that there's the Empire Builder train from North Dakota to Washington,

272
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,080
so Empire Penguin Builder.

273
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,200
Wait, should I just be taking the train?

274
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Is that what you're saying?

275
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,280
Maybe I'll just take the train next time.

276
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Yeah.

277
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,520
Dubstep Alan, oh my god.

278
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,180
If Alan approves it, I almost want to call it that.

279
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,680
I almost want to call it that if he approves it because it doesn't make any sense, but

280
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,920
if you've been around in the chat room for a while, it's so perfect.

281
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,120
Can we print up like a vinyl of his face and stick it on the side?

282
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,280
If somebody can politely get Alan's consent without harassing him, chat room, it's okay

283
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
to name it.

284
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,400
Now don't tell him it's my idea.

285
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
I think it should be Corky.

286
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,160
I think Corky has been elected for this.

287
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,760
He might make us put Beastie on there.

288
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,240
Yeah, or maybe like have to name like a future roadshow the FreeBSD Trip or something.

289
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
That's a reasonable compromise.

290
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,240
No, I don't think so actually.

291
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,080
Oh man, I don't think I can do it.

292
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,000
Alan Jude types with one finger, he points out with the keyboard and the keyboard does

293
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
the rest.

294
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh my god.

295
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Great.

296
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
This is what...

297
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Legends of Alan.

298
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,360
This is how egos are born, ladies and gentlemen.

299
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,880
This is how nice guys get egos.

300
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,840
All right, so let's get your ego better.

301
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,960
How do I say I know, right?

302
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
How do you do that?

303
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
I'll tell you how.

304
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,360
Learning, making yourself smarter, making yourself more employable.

305
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,920
Yeah, I'm talking about Linux Academy.

306
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:09,400
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and get our 33% discount, like a boss, 33% discount

307
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
is nuts.

308
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
It's crazy.

309
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,360
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and check them out.

310
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,480
So Linux Academy is a great resource to learn more about any technology around Linux.

311
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,700
I mean, obviously all the Linux basics and the essentials.

312
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,700
That's what you're going to get there.

313
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,120
And then everything around, you know, NGINX, Apache, OpenStack, virtualization, containerization,

314
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
all of that.

315
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
You're going to get that.

316
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,120
Self-paced too.

317
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,840
The courses are really good with videos and there's downloadable comprehensive study guides.

318
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,440
And PDFs that you can take with you or audio files you can listen to while you're naked

319
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
and wet in the shower.

320
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,000
I mean, good stuff.

321
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,600
And stuff that's going to stick with you too.

322
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,720
The kind of stuff that sticks on your bones and you remember because it's hands-on.

323
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
It's scenario based.

324
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,000
So you're really using the technology and you're working with it.

325
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,480
And you get to choose from seven plus Linux distributions, which is pretty sweet.

326
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,880
And the nice part about that is it's not just the courseware, which man, can you imagine

327
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,800
how dedicated and passionate you have to be just to create seven different iterations

328
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
of the courseware?

329
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,920
How do you systemize that in a way that makes that straightforward?

330
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,640
You still have to input all those different variations.

331
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,200
I mean, you still have to check it.

332
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
It is nuts.

333
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
They clearly love what they do here.

334
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Seriously.

335
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,080
And the nice thing is it also adjusts the virtual machines that spin up.

336
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,880
So everything comes with labs and you can do this stuff on, well not everything, but

337
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,560
all the courses that need to come with labs.

338
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,280
And when you turn them on, they match the distribution you've chosen.

339
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
It's brilliant.

340
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,360
Now you've heard me talk about Linux Academy for a while.

341
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,840
Did you know you could actually go work for them too?

342
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,180
Linux Academy is hiring and they're looking for some great new content creators.

343
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,600
They're also looking to fill some DevOps professionals and developers.

344
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,640
They're looking for anybody that does Linux development like C and C++, Bash, Perl, Python.

345
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,620
They're also looking for big data and machine learning developers who would love to share

346
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,640
their knowledge.

347
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,840
So they have educators that can help you put this into a format that's presentable.

348
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,640
But if this is an expertise you have, they really want to dive into that.

349
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,120
And if you're not even interested in video creation, they're also looking for certified

350
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,200
professionals to help increase just the exam database.

351
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,920
The Academy is going to pay $1 to $25 per question depending on the quality, depth and

352
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,480
accuracy of the questions.

353
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,400
Maybe if you just want to write up some good questions, that might be something to check

354
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
out.

355
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Here's how you can get started.

356
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Email career at linuxacademy.com.

357
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,600
And if you want to take advantage of Linux Academy, and I really think you should, it's

358
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,480
a great resource, especially if you can get your work to pay for it.

359
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,920
Oh man, that's a real slam dunk.

360
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,000
And work, by the way.

361
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,240
They have team accounts.

362
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
That's pretty cool.

363
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,640
So go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged business or personal.

364
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,640
You can get our discount.

365
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,160
Try it out for a little while for a 33% discount rate, which is nuts, essentially.

366
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
What a deal.

367
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,760
I think like a month of your first quarter is paid for with that or even more.

368
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
It's a really good deal.

369
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
It's super sweet.

370
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,080
I mean, it's such a good opportunity to get started, and it's something where your money

371
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,400
is going to a company who's crazy passionate about the ecosystem around it.

372
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,000
It's not just a feature checkbox for their online learning platform.

373
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's actually what they do.

374
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,040
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

375
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,520
the Linux Unplugged show, program, talk show, whatever you want to call it, we think.

376
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Experience.

377
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Yeah, that's good.

378
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,880
We should just call all these shows experiences, because you experience it however you want.

379
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,600
So Poby was busy this week in making sure that the MIR propaganda pumped out to all

380
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,280
of the usual presses and made sure that Joey over at OMG Ubuntu wrote up this great article.

381
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
I'm totally kidding.

382
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,120
But actually, Joey did catch a good spot.

383
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,160
Some Canonical employees were at a recent developer sprint, and this video was distributed

384
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,640
internally at Canonical to distribute the progress made on Xorg compatibility for MIR.

385
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,880
So like X apps running on top of MIR, you know, like XMIR.

386
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,420
And I just want to show a little bit of the video, even though you might be listening,

387
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,880
it's actually still pretty obvious if you just listen what they're doing here.

388
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,240
And it's looking pretty good.

389
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,440
So this is at the sprint.

390
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,440
We have our legacy X app icon.

391
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,760
So this is Unity 8, and they're showing here like the Chrome icon, the Firefox icon, GIMP,

392
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,240
and these are all X applications.

393
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:46,320
Chrome, UM, Firefox, G-Edit, UM, D-Brack Office, and XChat Ganon.

394
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,640
My screen isn't touch, so I have to do everything via quick pad, but we will start this out

395
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
out of the way.

396
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,640
There, he launches Firefox.

397
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
Cool about it.

398
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,160
Because whenever you exit, it thinks it's crashed, but it's okay.

399
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,200
So this, my understanding, and if I'm wrong, anybody feel free to correct me, but this

400
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,280
instance of Firefox is in its own container, I believe.

401
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,680
It's like, it's isolated from the rest of the operating system.

402
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,080
It's an X application running under MIR right here using, on the Unity 8 desktop.

403
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:38,600
So now here's the OpenGL demo that actually impressed me.

404
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,600
This is running, this is WebGL running in Firefox, and you know, he has a ton of fish

405
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
on the screen.

406
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:55,200
Remember, this is under MIR, but this is Firefox in X application.

407
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:08,240
And that's not necessarily a very nice laptop either, I was just about to say that, yeah.

408
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,240
That is pretty good.

409
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,200
Now, I don't know much more than what's in this video.

410
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Is there any background, Poppy, you want to fill in, or any details you want to point

411
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,000
out that we might have missed?

412
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,400
So this was done, the video was taken a couple of weeks ago when we were all in London for

413
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,880
a sprint, so we get together now and then in various places around the world where it's

414
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,560
just faster for you to all work sat next to each other.

415
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,080
You can have meetings and stuff as well, but it just works out quite nicely.

416
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,480
You can work pretty efficiently and quickly.

417
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,160
And Chris Townsend, who's the guy operating the laptop, was just giving a demo to Kevin

418
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,640
Gunn who made the video, and Kevin was just asking him to just do a demo of the progress

419
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,040
that they'd made that week.

420
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,960
And you're right, it is all containerized, and the reason for that is so that it respects

421
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,060
the architecture we've got for MIR applications under MIR.

422
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,840
So all the applications on the phone and on the desktop under MIR are siloed.

423
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,720
They're containerized, so that they can't interfere with each other and stomp on each

424
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,560
other's files and so on.

425
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:16,320
And we want to allow legacy apps to run under MIR as well, but also not be able to stomp

426
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,780
on all the other files, and don't allow Firefox to be able to read your contacts database

427
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,600
or whatever.

428
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:31,920
And so they've developed this tool called Libertine, which is on Launchpad, which is

429
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,400
the tool that containerizes all of this and makes it all kind of work, and it's pretty

430
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
cool.

431
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Yeah.

432
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,280
So if you wanted to try this, is this something people could get their hands on yet?

433
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
Or how exactly?

434
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
Yeah, I mean, you could.

435
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,280
You could.

436
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
I know you probably would want to, but...

437
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
I mean, he's got a dedicated...

438
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,200
He actually, you see on his desk, he's got two laptops, because the one on the right

439
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,720
is the one running Unity 8 and MIR, and he has it set up in a very specific way.

440
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,680
It's an Intel machine because of drivers.

441
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:09,520
So it's a little bit tricky to get going, but once it's in a state where it's something

442
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,720
we can share, I'm sure more people will use it.

443
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,120
I mean, it's all open source.

444
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,480
It's all on Launchpad, so it's not like we're hiding it or anything.

445
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,480
It's all available.

446
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,800
We just haven't made an image with it in or anything yet.

447
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:29,000
It seems like the key thing here is these XMIR applications are actually working pretty

448
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
well.

449
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,960
And that's got to be a pretty big point because I would think, I don't know, but I would think

450
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,260
a large percentage of the applications people are going to be using on a Unity 8 MIR desktop

451
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,960
is old X apps for a long time, especially the most critical ones like Firefox and Chrome

452
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
when they're using it on the desktop.

453
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
Right.

454
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
There's going to be a few.

455
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,880
I mean, there's going to be a few apps that everybody...

456
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,880
Maybe the majority.

457
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,120
If you look down your list of apps that you have open right now, they're X apps and many

458
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,880
of them won't run under Wayland or MIR.

459
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,960
So yes, we need to provide...

460
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,800
I mean, this is the whole part of the strategy of heading towards convergences.

461
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,640
We still need to provide a way for people to run their existing apps.

462
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,000
We're not just going to drop everything and say, ha, all that stuff you've built up over

463
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,760
the last 15 years, screw that stuff, throw it all away.

464
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
That's not what we're doing.

465
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,680
We're trying to make it possible for people to run those applications that they're familiar

466
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:28,280
with, but in performant way, but siloed so that they don't stumble over each other.

467
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,680
Because if we go back to having all the applications able to stumble over each other, then we're

468
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,600
no better than running under X.

469
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,400
We might as well just stay with X.

470
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:45,800
So it's a nice way to allow people to continue to run the apps they love on a new desktop.

471
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:51,240
So I'm going to ask you, Wes, since you're a practical tiling window manager kind of

472
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,040
thing, if you were going to do this, so you're on, like your home rig right now is Mint?

473
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
My home rig is Arch.

474
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Oh, your home rig is Arch.

475
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
Your work rig is Mint.

476
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
Yes.

477
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,880
So if you were going to upgrade one of these machines, would you look at the apps you're

478
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,880
running?

479
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,320
I mean, is this at a stage, say in a little while, would you switch to something like

480
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,920
Wayland or Mir if almost every single app you're using is X-based?

481
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,280
Or is it just one of those things where you would just stay on X?

482
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,760
I'm trying to decide from my standpoint, when does it make sense for me to switch over and

483
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
why?

484
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,480
And I'm looking at, it's got to be based on, that decision, which could be down the road

485
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,080
quite a ways, maybe I don't need to worry about it right now, it seems like that decision

486
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,120
is going to be based on the apps I use.

487
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,520
What are you going to base the decision on?

488
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,480
Well, you know, obviously if I'm running Arch, I'm interested in new interesting things.

489
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,200
So I do want to give them a try.

490
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I'm very interested.

491
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,080
The fact that you can just run your X app sandboxed in Mir, that's kind of really likeable.

492
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,240
So you might try just from the experimentation.

493
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,160
Yeah, and the fact that they're already sandboxed is awesome.

494
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,160
Yeah.

495
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Yeah.

496
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,160
Hmm.

497
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm not sure now is a good time to switch or any time really soon.

498
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,040
Or even if I would, I personally, I don't think I would switch to this right now.

499
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:13,040
And that's because I'm using a lot of Debian packages on my Debian-like style desktop.

500
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,040
And as we keep saying, that's not going away.

501
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,640
Everything's baked from those raw ingredients, which are the Debian packages.

502
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,640
Yeah.

503
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,320
So, you know, I can see people like expert users like you and me, and you know, many

504
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,600
of your listeners are already used to that and will just carry on using that.

505
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,440
But someone who goes into a store and buys a laptop that has Ubuntu pre-installed, maybe

506
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,360
in a couple of years, right?

507
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:45,680
That may have Unity 8 and Mir pre-installed, but have a nice button that lets you install

508
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,320
apps that they're familiar with, that they've seen before, or that some online guide or

509
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,040
an expert friend has told them to get.

510
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,880
So I think probably those are the kind of people who would probably move first.

511
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,200
But we might experiment.

512
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,600
Like you say, Wes, you know, have a look at it, have a play with it.

513
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Maybe it won't-

514
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
I wonder.

515
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
I think so.

516
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
I think a percent, a niche of the niche will.

517
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,920
But I also wonder if many people, if the threshold's always going to be, well, what are my applications?

518
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,120
Then I wonder if it's going to be one of those things that just keeps getting delayed and

519
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,240
delayed and delayed for the most people.

520
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,200
But I'll give Northranger a chance to jump in with visions of if we no longer had to

521
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
deal with X.

522
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Go ahead, Northranger.

523
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,200
Yeah.

524
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:28,400
I mean, with your desktop environments like KDE and GNOME on the desktop, getting much

525
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,960
improved support in the last 12 months, and the push from folks like Canonical on the

526
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:43,640
mobile side, I think we might see a switch to these next generation, whether it's Wayland,

527
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,160
Mirror, et cetera, on the various platforms.

528
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,640
We'll see that switch happen sooner rather than later because we'll get benefits in performance

529
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,600
of the actual desktop environment.

530
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:59,760
You know, on a tablet, you definitely want every last little bit of frame rate, the fewest

531
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,760
milliseconds of touch response time where technologies like Mirror are a real benefit.

532
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,840
So as long as your base desktop is running it, even if your apps are containerized and

533
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:17,600
running through the second layer X server, we can live with that.

534
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Yeah.

535
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Yeah, I agree.

536
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,400
Yeah, if there's quick adoption there, that would be...

537
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,520
I could see myself like when I run on a GNOME desktop, I try to run like all GTK applications.

538
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,640
And when I run on a KDE desktop, I try to run all QT applications.

539
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:35,000
I could see a time where if there's enough applications, I might use one web browser

540
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,040
over the other if it was native to Wayland versus an X app.

541
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,040
Could you see yourself doing that?

542
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
I could definitely, yeah.

543
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:45,960
And if running the X app still works really well, then why not switch to the back end?

544
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,160
That Firefox WebGL demo was fairly impressive to me because that doesn't seem to be much

545
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,160
of a...

546
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,260
Even if there is a performance penalty, if it can do that fairly successful, the performance

547
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,160
penalty is not going to be that big to your web browsing session.

548
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,800
And so if you're curious what we're talking about, we have the video embedded in the show

549
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,960
notes.

550
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,120
And I'm glad you guys decided to post that, Poppy, because I know it's not like the most

551
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,680
polished video, but it's really cool to see.

552
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,680
Very interesting.

553
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,680
Yeah.

554
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
To really see it.

555
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
And it's nice.

556
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
I think you're going to see some more of those.

557
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
Good.

558
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,680
I think that was the first of...

559
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,840
A trial balloon?

560
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,800
I think we want to show off some of this stuff because we get a reputation for sitting in

561
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:30,520
rooms and doing stuff privately and all the code is on Launchpad, but because people don't

562
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:36,460
build it and run it and see it, they think that it doesn't exist when in fact it's actively

563
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,460
worked on.

564
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,460
And that video is two weeks old.

565
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,920
It's on Launchpad, there's really loads of changes since then.

566
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,320
So this video shows us it is true.

567
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,080
You guys are working together in closed rooms, but now you're just showing it to us.

568
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,080
Documented closed rooms.

569
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,080
No, it's just funny.

570
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,400
Because it's cool that you're publishing that.

571
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
It's a good point.

572
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Well taken.

573
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,440
And for me, it was like, well, this is...

574
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,680
And you know what the other thing is, Poppy, is the Internet's full of lazy cats.

575
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,360
Who wants to sit there and build all that stuff when you can just watch a YouTube video

576
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,360
of it?

577
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,580
And one of the things that some of the other desktop projects have going for them is they

578
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:13,560
just have super enthusiastic fans that go and do video production.

579
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,700
We're going to talk about when we get to GNOME 3.18, we're going to talk about some of these

580
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,920
videos that show off GNOME 3.18 and some of these write-ups that the GNOME Foundation

581
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,760
should be paying these people for it.

582
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
It's so well done.

583
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,840
And so it's good to get your version of it out there, too.

584
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
That's what I say to that.

585
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,760
And I like seeing that WebGL demo.

586
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
I'm not going to admit it.

587
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
Slick.

588
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,760
Yeah, very slick.

589
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
You know what else is real slick there, Wes?

590
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
This is super crazy slick.

591
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
In fact, I love them.

592
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,520
I use them all the time.

593
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
DigitalOcean.

594
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
Heck yeah, it's DigitalOcean.

595
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
Where's my...

596
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
Hold on.

597
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
Here we go.

598
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
You got to go there right now, actually.

599
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,040
I was going to say, if you don't know about DigitalOcean, then I got bad news.

600
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,560
You have been under a rock because something really cool has been developing for a long

601
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560
time.

602
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,440
And you can get on it for two months for absolutely free when you use our promo code, DOUNPLUGGED.

603
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,060
Go over to digitalocean.com and remember DOUNPLUGGED.

604
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,760
And now I'm going to tell you about them.

605
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,960
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

606
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,240
easy way for you to get your own Linux machine up in the sky.

607
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,360
Now yeah, you could also deploy FreeBSD, but come on, you're listening to Linux Unplugged.

608
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,960
And they have CoreOS, which is really cool.

609
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,200
They work with the CoreOS folks.

610
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,760
And they have Ubuntu on there, and they've got the LTSs, and they've got the 1504.

611
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,840
They even have the latest Fedora.

612
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,600
Like after a couple of weeks after...

613
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,240
I mean, I'm not trying to burn you Corora guys, but come on.

614
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,800
DigitalOcean has Fedora 22 up on DigitalOcean for immediate deployment before the Corora

615
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,520
project even gets their respin out.

616
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,400
Now come on guys, I know you're busy, but come on.

617
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Come on.

618
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Come on, DigitalOcean.

619
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
I mean, of course, you know what?

620
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
The problem is they're just super badass.

621
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,120
In fact, check out their interface and you can see how it's a priority for them.

622
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,320
They've managed to take something complicated like managing servers around the world and

623
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,120
make it in a super simple, straightforward interface.

624
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,400
In fact, the other thing that's really cool about that interface is they have an API.

625
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,520
And that API lets you do all the things you want to do, either automated or through some

626
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,880
of the great community apps.

627
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,480
So remember that promo code DOUNPLUGGED?

628
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,800
Here's what I want you to remember.

629
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,200
Go over there and use it because you're going to get a $10 credit and the base rig starts

630
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
at $5 a month.

631
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,760
They get you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

632
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,440
Now the nice thing is if you wanted to do something really beefy, like I decided when

633
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,520
I went Minecraft for my son, I wanted to go just kind of a little bit more beefy.

634
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,180
The pricing is really straightforward.

635
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:29,280
It's just $10, you get an even nicer rig, $20, you get an even nicer rig.

636
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,280
It's obvious.

637
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,280
It's right there.

638
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,520
And then the other thing that's really cool is if you want to do some testing or production

639
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,500
load balancing, they have hourly pricing.

640
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,500
It's really neat.

641
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,440
And then the other thing that they don't really mention a lot on their site, but I think they

642
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,820
should, I think they should put it in here as like a little asterisk, is they also have

643
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,760
private networking.

644
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:52,440
And you can set up private networking between your different droplets and then you can have

645
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,180
like a front-end web server and a back-end database server or a front-end X2Go server

646
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,640
and a back-end NAS server, right?

647
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,440
And the transfer over that private networking is free.

648
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,580
So you don't have to pay for any data.

649
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,280
So if you're doing like backups, that's really nice.

650
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,760
In fact, here's what you can go to DigitalOcean.

651
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,180
You can read more about it.

652
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,560
It's really straightforward to set up.

653
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,760
It's a really cool system.

654
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,940
And I think it's like we did an episode about remote Linux desktops at the Linux Action

655
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,720
Show a couple of months ago.

656
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,200
You combine a front-end X2Go server with a couple of back-end droplets, and all of these

657
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,760
things are like $5 a month, plus you use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, you get the $10 credit.

658
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,320
It's a really cool way to do this.

659
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,660
And you can start kind of thinking about things a little differently because you can really

660
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,920
build your own private infrastructure up there, all running on top of a Linux KVM server,

661
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,800
all SSDs throughout, and the pricing is very straightforward.

662
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,480
Go check them out, DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED and a big thanks

663
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,300
to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

664
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,480
You guys got a great service.

665
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
You rock.

666
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
Oh, man.

667
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
I wish I could do a good...

668
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
Can you do any accents, Wes?

669
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,480
I can't.

670
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,480
I wish I could do a Scottish accent.

671
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,480
Oh, I can't.

672
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
I wish.

673
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
I can do bad accents.

674
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
Can you do Canadian?

675
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,480
No?

676
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Usually all Americans can do Canadian, Wes.

677
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
They just don't want to.

678
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
All right.

679
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
So let's move on.

680
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
Let's talk about how Debian is going to shut down the CIA.

681
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
Oh, man.

682
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,200
I don't know about this.

683
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,480
So Motherboard, which as we were talking about in the pre-show, is a vice company, is really

684
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,680
getting into a nitty-gritty topic in the Linux distro world.

685
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,160
And I was kind of surprised to see this.

686
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,160
So that was one of the reasons why I actually wanted to cover it in the show today, is this

687
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,120
is new territory for Motherboard, and they're obviously trying to drive clicks with that,

688
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:35,040
how Debian is trying to shut down the CIA headline and make software trustworthy again.

689
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,580
But the effort is almost worth a grabby headline like that.

690
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:46,800
So this is from a presentation that was given at the Chaos Communications Camp in Germany

691
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
earlier this month.

692
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,680
So I have the full presentation linked in the show notes.

693
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,640
And by a Debian developer, Jeremy, oh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it, Bobbio, or

694
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,760
something, B-O, Bobbio, B-O, B-B-I-O, B-O, B-B-I-O.

695
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,760
I love it.

696
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,760
Whatever it is.

697
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,760
But this I can say.

698
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,160
He's better known online as Lunar.

699
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,680
And he told the audience how Linux-based operating systems are working to bring reproducible

700
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:15,400
builds to all of its 22,000 software packages, so all of Debian's packages.

701
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,920
So here's a layman's breakdown of what a reproducible build is if you're not familiar.

702
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,440
As the name suggests, it makes it possible for other people to reproduce the build process.

703
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,120
The idea is to get a reasonable confidence that a given binary was indeed produced by

704
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,880
the source.

705
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,120
This is a quote from Lunar's presentation.

706
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,160
We want anyone to be able to produce identical binaries from given source.

707
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:41,260
A software package reproducibility build should be byte for byte identical to the publicly

708
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,260
available package.

709
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,520
Any difference would be evidence of tampering.

710
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,680
Reproducible builds rely in part on David A. Wheeler's solution to this problem called

711
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,880
diverse double compiling.

712
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,320
Are you ready for this one, Wes?

713
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,320
Well, let's hear it.

714
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,320
Are you excited?

715
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,320
I am.

716
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,320
Okay, good, good.

717
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,320
I'm giddy.

718
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:05,040
So Lunar explains you need two compilers with one that you somehow trust.

719
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,680
Then you build the compiler under test twice, once with each compiler, and then you use

720
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,160
the compilers that you just built to build the compiler under test again.

721
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,500
If the output is the same, then there are no back doors.

722
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,200
But for this scheme to work, you need to be able to compare that both outputs are the

723
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
same.

724
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,040
And that's exactly what we are enabling with having reproducible builds.

725
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:30,120
According to Lunar, 83% of Debian's packages are now built reproducibly with more of the

726
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,160
join the party every day.

727
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,440
So does this sound kind of like in line with what you've read about reproducible builds?

728
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,280
Is this essentially you can take the source and when you build it, it's exactly what the

729
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,440
source should be, exactly what the author says?

730
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,440
Yes.

731
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,360
So one of the big challenges is making sure that you've got a build system set up in such

732
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,680
a way that you can easily do that and that other people can easily replicate.

733
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,880
Yeah, because there is the issue is the compiler compromise.

734
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,920
Like if you're really worried about a state actor, the compiler could be the weak link.

735
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:59,140
So that is a key piece of this.

736
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:04,120
So when I see this, I think to myself, well, this seems like A, from a technical standpoint,

737
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,640
an amazing feat to pull off.

738
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,760
Okay, so let's read this part again.

739
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,640
You need two compilers with one that you trust, then you build the compiler under test twice,

740
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,640
once with each compiler.

741
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:20,040
Okay, so you build the compiler twice, once with each compiler, and then you use the compilers

742
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,280
that you just built to build the compiler again under test.

743
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,840
That's how you verify a compiler.

744
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
Wow.

745
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,200
If the output is the same, then that compiler has no back doors.

746
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
Wow.

747
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,240
Yeah, that just verifies that the compiler doesn't have any back doors.

748
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,240
Right, but you need, yes, right.

749
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,640
The idea is you have to have a verifiable compiler and then you have to have verifiable

750
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,640
packages too.

751
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,560
Like it's not just one or the other.

752
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,160
That's the tricky thing, I think, right?

753
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,160
Am I following this right?

754
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,160
That seems like, yeah.

755
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,160
Well, it's not that tricky.

756
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:52,740
Even though they say reproducible, you can also say it verifiable, or authentic build

757
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,720
builds because the output will be identical from either compiler.

758
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
Break it down.

759
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,080
So why do you say authentic?

760
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
What did you say?

761
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,960
Or because you can just hash or-

762
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,960
Oh yeah, okay.

763
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,960
Verify.

764
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
Because it's binary.

765
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,960
So bit per bit compatible or comparable and exact to what the other compilers put out.

766
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,440
So you can have an official version.

767
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
Right, yeah.

768
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
That makes sense.

769
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,440
That's what they mean.

770
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,720
Instead of just reproducible builds, they're just using a different name.

771
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,220
Verifiable builds are a lot more common.

772
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,220
You disagree, Wimpy?

773
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,220
No.

774
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:29,080
Yeah, I do because the issue here is ensuring that your origin compiler wasn't backdoored

775
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:34,840
at the outset and therefore everything you compile contains a backdoor that was in that

776
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,840
compiler.

777
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Right.

778
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:41,200
Like the big boogeyman story is the NSA gets credentials to a repo and replaces FTP or

779
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,080
something like that.

780
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,880
Or you go back to the very first version, the very first compiler that Richard Stallman

781
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:56,920
used to build the GNU toolchain and was that backdoored and compromised and therefore is

782
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:03,600
every GNU compiler since compromised or rather everything that the GNU compiler creates compromised.

783
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:10,800
So this is a real tinfoil hat example, but the issue here is making sure that there isn't

784
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,560
a backdoor in the compiler that introduces backdoors into your compiled code.

785
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Yeah.

786
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,920
That's also why they need to have the same Blitzy in all the libraries that they link

787
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,920
to.

788
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,280
They have to include them in order to have the reproducible builds.

789
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,360
Yeah.

790
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:33,440
So this is something that is essentially more of a process problem than it is a technology

791
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,720
problem for these distros.

792
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,240
So essentially what Debian is implementing is a process, right?

793
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,400
And so this is something that other distros should probably look at, I would think.

794
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,000
Should this be something that Red Hat can claim as well?

795
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,880
Wouldn't SUSE want to be able to claim this as well?

796
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
I would think.

797
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,080
It might help their verifiability or static analysis.

798
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
So like-

799
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,480
It adds one more thing to there.

800
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
Yeah.

801
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,480
Because this is, as the motherboard article points out, this is a staple of the Bitcoin

802
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,280
and Tor project today.

803
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,800
Obviously these projects, they need this kind of verifiability, so they already do this.

804
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:15,960
And FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenWRT have announced that they'll also be doing this.

805
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,880
So it seems like there's a big movement here to me for people that want to be trusted.

806
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,800
So you've got to figure it's something that's on a lot of people's minds.

807
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,080
And Red Hat's been looking into a lot of this stuff, so I don't know.

808
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,240
I wouldn't be surprised if we don't see an announcement at some point.

809
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,160
Kind of similar to the functional package managers like Nix.

810
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
Yeah.

811
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,240
They have like a hash of all the dependencies that go into building.

812
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,360
They kind of do this by default.

813
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
Huh.

814
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,500
I don't know if all the implications are there necessarily, but-

815
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,080
I'm going to make a prediction right now.

816
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,800
Red Hat 8, one of the features on the box, reproducible builds.

817
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
You watch.

818
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
You've called it.

819
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
Yeah.

820
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,800
What was it?

821
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
I know somebody was going to say something.

822
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,160
Also, they don't even need to just be built for security reasons.

823
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:03,160
Building for containerization and virtualization and cloud purposes also benefit from this

824
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,720
reproducible build stuff.

825
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Oh yeah.

826
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,840
Yeah, that's a good point.

827
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
Yeah.

828
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,160
There is that aspect to it, just ensuring you're delivering your software completely

829
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,160
and things like that.

830
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,160
Yeah.

831
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,120
I think the reason why we took the bent of the NSA and CIA is because, well, Lunar says,

832
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,600
he says, what was the line he said here?

833
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,120
The great thing is that free software is... No, that's not it.

834
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,120
This is actually a good quote.

835
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,120
I'll read this anyways.

836
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,640
The great thing with free software is that we have the freedom to study the source code,

837
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,680
that it does not contain any malware, malicious code, or security, but how, Lunar asks, do

838
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,160
we know that the compiler binary was not built from the published source?

839
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,860
How do we know the CIA or other malicious attacker has not tampered with the build process?

840
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,120
He says, we are not discussing a hypothetical attack here.

841
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
This is a real attack.

842
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,460
We are talking about developers in totally good faith producing software with the binary

843
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:57,720
they would give you, and even if they are of good faith, we could be totally owned still.

844
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,680
Reproducible builds already are a state of... Oh, I read that part, of Bitcoin and the

845
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,680
Tor project.

846
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,520
So he argues that it's already a real attack problem, and he's kind of the one, I think,

847
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,800
put the CIA spin on it, that the motherboard took and ran.

848
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,240
Well, and it does sound here, it looks like the CIA tried to break into Apple, which is

849
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
...

850
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
Oh, yeah.

851
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,160
And I also think there's been some questions about the Debian project itself, too.

852
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,560
Yeah, I mean, they distribute a lot of software.

853
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:26,600
There was a talk given on this subject at FOSDEM earlier this year, and it wasn't just

854
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
related to this.

855
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,760
It was also the auditability and the fact that actually some of the packages in the

856
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:39,880
archive were built not by the builders, builders in the cloud, but actually on developers'

857
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,840
local machines, and what really should happen is all of those builds should move to the

858
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,420
server where they can be verified, because if they're being built on a local machine

859
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,520
by a developer, then it makes it even harder to verify that it's not been compromised.

860
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,960
Yeah, because who knows the state of that developer machine?

861
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,960
Yeah.

862
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,960
Oh, you developers.

863
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,960
Developer machines are notorious.

864
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,960
Developers, developers, developers.

865
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,880
Yeah, interesting, and it's an area that is sort of new to me, but it sounds like actually

866
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,440
once you kind of take away some of the... You just change the words you use, and it actually

867
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,440
makes a lot of sense.

868
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,440
It looks like they've got a link to the full slides and discussion.

869
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,440
Yes, sir.

870
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,000
I'll put a link to that there in the show notes directly.

871
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,560
Now, it is a PDF, but it's his whole presentation that he gave.

872
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,240
It looks like a lot of good information.

873
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,400
Yeah, and he has some good quotes in there, too.

874
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,440
He starts out with a really good quote, so it's worth a read if you're fascinated by

875
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,440
this topic as I was.

876
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,840
I probably will pick it up after the show, actually, because I don't have very good connectivity

877
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,840
out in the trailer, but I can download that to my Instapaper, too.

878
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,840
There you go.

879
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,840
Just read it offline.

880
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,840
I might actually do that.

881
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,840
That's a good idea.

882
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,680
I have a little bookmark that just sends it right into my queue.

883
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,680
Very nice.

884
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,680
Yeah, it is nice.

885
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,680
All right.

886
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,760
Speaking of connectivity, I've got to tell you about my good friends over at the Ting

887
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,760
Network.

888
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,760
I want you to go there and check them out, too, won't you?

889
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,800
Because we have a special $50 promo at linux.ting.com.

890
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,400
linux.ting.com will give you the $50 promo off a device, or if you have a compatible

891
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,280
device already, then they're going to give you $50 of service credit, which is really,

892
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,720
really, really, really slick.

893
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,600
This is only going on until the end of September, so I want you to go over there and try them

894
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
right now.

895
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,080
If you're a small business, too, this is a really slick way to get not just good devices,

896
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,920
but just constant connectivity and communications that doesn't require an arm and a leg to pay

897
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,920
for it.

898
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,920
Here's why.

899
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,680
No contract, nor the termination fee, and you only pay for what you use.

900
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,280
Six dollars is the starting rate, and then it's just your usage on top of that.

901
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,060
Now, if you can be really handy with your Wi-Fi usage, like we are here at the studio,

902
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,280
it's really slick.

903
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,240
You can get SIM cards right now as low as $5.

904
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,980
So if you've got a device that works with Ting's GSM network, $5 SIM card, and you're

905
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,980
on Ting.

906
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,200
It's really, really nice.

907
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,320
Free shipping right now.

908
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,560
Also, they've got some great phones on sale.

909
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,840
You can get the Kiosar Kona for $68.

910
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,360
If you just want a great feature phone with a good screen and the battery that lasts forever

911
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,840
ever, like five days, $68.

912
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,200
No contract, nor the termination fee.

913
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,420
Refurbished Samsung Galaxy S3, $122.

914
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,600
Now here's the good one.

915
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,880
Samsung Galaxy S6.

916
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,880
My baby.

917
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,880
My baby.

918
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,920
You can get $80 off.

919
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,200
Now it's $568, but you own that phone like you would a laptop or a smart, you know, like

920
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,680
a real device.

921
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,280
Not a toy, but a real device.

922
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,280
That's nice.

923
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,880
And then the nice thing is if you ever get stuck, Ting has no hold customer service.

924
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,360
You call them at 1855 Ting FTWs.

925
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,520
But even better than that, they have like the best dashboard ever to manage all of this.

926
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,240
You can do everything from the Ting dashboard.

927
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,280
You can get a real easy, like they have this promo picture right here, and you're like,

928
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,280
oh, that's a nice mocked up image of what the Ting, no, that's what the Ting dashboard

929
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,280
looks like.

930
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,560
It's really what it looks like.

931
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,720
It's very, very, very slick.

932
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,920
And this video shows you some of it.

933
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,920
And it kind of gives you an idea.

934
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,920
Yeah.

935
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,920
Oh, yeah.

936
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,920
Go Wes.

937
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,920
Nice, buddy.

938
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,920
That's right.

939
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,080
And the next thing you can do, so we have several, we have several phones on our, on

940
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,640
our line and you just go in there and name them.

941
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,880
So I don't have to like remember the numbers.

942
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,680
It just shows me the name of each device.

943
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,120
I can see the usage so I can see like who's taking up all the data.

944
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:59,000
I can set alerts if I need to or want to, but it's not really a big deal since we're

945
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,160
only paying like 40 bucks a month for all three phones at the most.

946
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,440
You can also do things like if you want one line that maybe hides caller ID or a one line

947
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,980
that can't do video messaging or something like that, you can go turn those individual

948
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,920
things on and off in the dashboard, all kinds of stuff like that.

949
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,720
You can also just disable the line for a little while if you don't need it.

950
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,120
So it's pretty cool.

951
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:20,480
And it also all integrates in with the dash app on the phone for iPhone or Android.

952
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,280
You can get push notifications if you want them, but I don't really, again, because the

953
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,280
ting rates are so low.

954
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,280
I don't really care.

955
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,120
But you can manage all the aspects of the plan from the device right there if you need

956
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,120
to.

957
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,280
That's particularly nice if you've got like a teenager or something who's burning through

958
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,360
that data watching YouTube.

959
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,920
My son is six years old and he's already doing it.

960
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,920
So I feel your pain.

961
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,560
But the nice thing is I can get alerts if I need them.

962
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,560
And it works pretty good.

963
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,600
And you can also call them at 1-855-TING-FTW anytime between 8 a.m. or 8 p.m. and you can

964
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,680
talk to a real human being.

965
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,520
Just get started by going to linux.ting.com.

966
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:54,120
They'll take $50 off your first device or if you've got a compatible device, you can

967
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,120
get $50 of service credit.

968
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:59,160
Now, I'm telling you, I've got three phones, okay?

969
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,360
Now I'm very Wi-Fi savvy to be honest with you, but I've got three phones and I'm paying

970
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,440
like 40 bucks a month.

971
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,520
So if you can get a $50 service credit by bringing a compatible phone because I've got

972
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,600
a CDMA and GSM, that's pretty sweet.

973
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,600
That's pretty sweet.

974
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,960
Plus, you know, just checking them out also helps us out.

975
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,640
Go to linux.ting.com and try their savings calculator.

976
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,920
Maybe it's worth your time.

977
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,600
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

978
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,240
Okay, Wes, brace yourself, my friend.

979
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,760
Are you ready to switch to GNOME?

980
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,520
Say no if you're not because maybe by the end you will be.

981
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,520
Maybe I need a little more convincing.

982
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,520
Okay, all right.

983
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,520
All right.

984
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,520
Okay.

985
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:44,840
So I got to start with a shout out to World of Goo or WooGoo or whatever, WooGoo, W-O-G-U-E.

986
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:49,560
And this guy is essentially blogging on Google Plus about features about GNOME.

987
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,620
And he just does a really, really, really, really great job.

988
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,920
So I want to give him a shout out because a lot of the stuff he's pulling out that are

989
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,360
not in the release notes specifically, they're not really...

990
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,960
GNOME is not doing a particularly good job about promoting these features.

991
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:07,500
So he goes out of his way to put really great videos together that cover all the different

992
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,560
cool features of GNOME that you don't see.

993
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,080
Watch this one here.

994
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,080
They have one of the things...

995
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,360
Okay, Wes, this is going to be one of the first new features I want to show you.

996
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,360
See if he...

997
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,360
Oh, hi there, ladies.

998
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,360
So here's the...

999
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,360
Did those come with the terminal?

1000
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,240
No, no.

1001
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,880
So he has these videos that show the new features of GNOME and he does a really good job of

1002
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,880
going through this.

1003
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,200
But check out this new feature, Wes.

1004
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,800
One of the first new features that's coming to a GNOME 3.18's terminal is they've made

1005
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,280
the terminal much slicker.

1006
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,680
But he's got a lot of good music going, doesn't he?

1007
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,680
Oh, yeah.

1008
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,840
Okay, Wes, watch this terminal.

1009
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,840
Watch this terminal.

1010
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,840
You see that?

1011
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,840
Okay, hold on.

1012
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,880
Sorry, he's got his titles in the way so you can't quite see it.

1013
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,880
There it goes.

1014
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,400
All right, so he's got the GNOME terminal up right now and he's changing one setting

1015
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,720
in there and check this out.

1016
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,720
You can drag tabs around.

1017
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,720
See that?

1018
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,720
Look at that.

1019
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,720
That's very...

1020
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,720
Look at that.

1021
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,720
Very nice.

1022
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,720
Okay, so the new GNOME terminal...

1023
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,020
This is the only weekend that I'm building up.

1024
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,440
The new GNOME terminal has a very much like Firefox tab-like thing.

1025
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,680
You can drag them around.

1026
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,760
You drag them off the terminal where they pop up into their own tab, that kind of thing.

1027
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,760
That's not bad, right?

1028
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,760
Yeah.

1029
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,760
You're with me so far?

1030
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,760
Oh, yeah.

1031
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,760
Okay.

1032
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,760
All right.

1033
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,760
Honestly, I already like GNOME terminal.

1034
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,760
It's pretty reliable.

1035
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,760
Yeah, yeah.

1036
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,760
But that's not bad.

1037
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,760
Okay, I'm still getting there.

1038
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,760
Of course, Northern Ranger, if I don't get to it, then you can announce it.

1039
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,760
But now here's the next one.

1040
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,440
Wes, we were talking about Wayland earlier today and I want to make the case, even though

1041
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:32,840
the Kaywin project is coming very far on its Wayland support, I have to say, GNOME 3.18

1042
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,800
is introducing some impressive Wayland features.

1043
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,240
The most anticipated feature, for me at least, is somebody just finally said, so we're really

1044
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,080
here with Wayland, but we're close.

1045
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,280
Because NVIDIA doesn't support Wayland yet, so that's a big stopper.

1046
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,160
But if you can get around the fact that NVIDIA isn't supporting Wayland, the GNOME 3.18 desktop

1047
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,760
is pretty rock solid now.

1048
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,440
A bunch of improvements have gone into Mudder specifically, so it's very performant under

1049
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,440
Wayland.

1050
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,400
They've set up shared clipboards now, so your X applications and your Wayland applications

1051
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,920
can copy and paste between each other.

1052
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,840
It's really good stuff.

1053
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:09,640
And so the world of GooGuy or WooGoo or whatever, he has been blogging like a machine about

1054
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,460
all the different things that are working and not working and problems like that.

1055
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:18,760
But it's looking like Wayland support is looking really good, almost good enough for everyday

1056
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,600
use, especially if you're on Intel now, starting with GNOME 3.18.

1057
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,600
Everyday use.

1058
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,600
Everyday use.

1059
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,600
Whoop.

1060
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,240
Are you ready for this?

1061
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,920
I might be.

1062
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,280
You know, I swear I muted my phone before the show started, and somehow during the show

1063
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,280
it got unmuted.

1064
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,600
I do not know how that happened.

1065
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,080
All right, so okay, the next feature.

1066
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:41,080
Are you ready for the next feature of GNOME 3.18?

1067
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,080
Are you ready for the next feature?

1068
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,080
Let's hear it.

1069
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:47,760
All right, the next feature for GNOME 3.18 is going to disable that crappy search in the

1070
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,360
open dialog box and on network drives, recursive search that kills Nautilus and makes it die,

1071
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,360
and finally fixes that up.

1072
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,360
What do you think of that one?

1073
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,360
What do you got?

1074
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,360
Nothing?

1075
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,360
Long overdue.

1076
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,360
Yeah, I'm not.

1077
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,360
I'm not surprising you.

1078
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,360
About damn time.

1079
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,360
All right.

1080
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,360
Okay, now you're ready for the...

1081
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,360
Of course, I don't know if I'm going to sell you with this one, but one of the big features

1082
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,440
that's making a lot of headlines today, this is the one that everybody's talking about

1083
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:11,680
as we record, GNOME 3.18 is going to allow you direct access to Google Drive right in

1084
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,680
Nautilus.

1085
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,680
Oh, really?

1086
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,680
Yeah.

1087
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,680
Right in.

1088
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,680
Built right in Nautilus.

1089
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,680
GNOME, you're going to have access.

1090
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,360
That's going to mount to kind of like a web drive, kind of share, so it's going to be...

1091
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:24,200
What is it using in the back end?

1092
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,200
Probably some kind of web drive.

1093
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,200
It's not full sync.

1094
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,200
Okay.

1095
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,200
Far as I know.

1096
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,200
But NorthRanger, was that what you...

1097
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,200
You thought the big lead was the Google Drive support, or something else you're excited

1098
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,200
about?

1099
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,200
I was actually excited about the Wayland clipboard support.

1100
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1101
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,200
Yeah.

1102
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,200
And it's full like drag and drop even.

1103
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,200
Like you can...

1104
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,200
Oh, wow.

1105
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,200
Yeah.

1106
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,200
It's real nice work.

1107
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,200
They've really done...

1108
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,200
That's a big improvement.

1109
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,200
That's awesome.

1110
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,200
Yeah.

1111
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,200
It really is kind of...

1112
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,560
It's going to make it much easier to coexist with Xapps and Wayland apps on the same desktop.

1113
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,200
So that's a huge deal, but if you're not running Wayland yet, it's not app big.

1114
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,400
But the fact that they're basically saying we're getting close to everyday use is really,

1115
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,800
I think, pretty exciting.

1116
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,960
I think GNOME 3.18 is actually going to look like a really good release, and I didn't really

1117
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,960
know.

1118
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,560
One of the things is, I started digging around before we started this episode to kind of

1119
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,400
see, okay, well, here's what the GNOME project sort of outlined about what's really cool.

1120
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,360
But when you actually start digging into some of the release notes and things like that,

1121
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,200
there's things they're not putting in the release notes that are...

1122
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,120
There's a lot of little small improvements that they're bringing into GNOME 3.18 that

1123
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,000
I don't know.

1124
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,760
I think it's looking like a really great desktop.

1125
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,760
So if you're going to try out Wayland...

1126
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,760
That seems like the way to do it.

1127
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,000
It seems like, I think.

1128
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I think if you're going to try...

1129
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,920
I don't know how your awesome window manager is going to work, Wes, but I think if you're

1130
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,920
going to try...

1131
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,920
I just love that I don't...

1132
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,760
I don't think this is looking like you're having a hard time.

1133
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,080
I think if you're going to try out Wayland, I think you're going to have to try out GNOME

1134
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,080
3.18.

1135
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,080
I think you're right.

1136
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,080
Okay, we'll see.

1137
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,080
I mean, GNOME is fast becoming, you know, it...

1138
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,840
All right, second prediction of the show.

1139
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,560
Second prediction of the show, Wes switches back to GNOME.

1140
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,560
I swear.

1141
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,760
Because right now you've got Awesome and Cinnamon.

1142
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,760
Yep.

1143
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,200
Does anybody know, anybody know what Cinnamon's plan is for Wayland?

1144
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,840
What's the, what's the plans there?

1145
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,840
Is...

1146
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,840
Are they working on that right now?

1147
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,840
I know they're using GTK 3.

1148
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,840
Yeah, yeah.

1149
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,840
I guess as long as...

1150
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,840
And they're...

1151
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,840
What are they using?

1152
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,840
What's the compositor for?

1153
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,840
They're...

1154
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,800
Well, it's, it's called...

1155
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,000
It's forked from mutter and there's...

1156
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Yeah, that's right.

1157
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
It's called...

1158
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,240
It begins with M, muffin.

1159
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:15,720
But when I spoke to Clem about this a little while ago, he's just waiting for Wayland to

1160
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:20,120
really get to the point where it's got mass adoption behind it.

1161
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:26,400
And I think what that really means is that the, the GPU vendors support it.

1162
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,400
Yeah.

1163
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,520
And you know, he also probably wants to see just where things play out with, with Mir

1164
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,540
too, because I mean, if he's based on Ubuntu, that might end up being a way to go too.

1165
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:39,360
So the GNOME 3.18 release, why, why am I talking about this right now?

1166
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,520
Because it's supposed to come out by the end of the month and I might be on the road when

1167
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,520
it hits.

1168
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,320
And I don't know if I'm going to have the bandwidth to download it and give it a review.

1169
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,880
So I just wanted to kind of talk about it right now because I'm going to be jonesing

1170
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,880
for it.

1171
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,880
When I have that...

1172
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,880
Oh man.

1173
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,880
Oh, that's going to be rough.

1174
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,880
If GNOME 3.18 hits.

1175
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,440
I bet it doesn't hit stable repos, but I bet by the time I get back, I bet it's not in

1176
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,240
stable, but before I get back, I bet, I bet, I bet it won't hit the stable.

1177
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,340
Can you wait?

1178
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,340
I don't think I could.

1179
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,340
I think I'll...

1180
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:06,640
If it hits stable repos while I'm on the road, I think I will probably find a spot to get

1181
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,640
wifi.

1182
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,920
And I think I will do the updates.

1183
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,920
I have to man.

1184
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,920
You kind of have to.

1185
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,920
I mean, I can't go a couple of days.

1186
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,920
Yeah.

1187
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:13,920
I'll go to a Starbucks.

1188
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,840
I'll go to XT and I'll do the update there.

1189
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,840
Yeah.

1190
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,840
I will know.

1191
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,840
I'm hoping.

1192
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,520
I haven't, I haven't got all the details yet, but hopefully Ting's going to be providing

1193
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,440
connectivity on GSM and CDMA networks for me along the trip.

1194
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:31,920
So we'll see, but still it feels like an abuse of a privilege to update my, my arch boxes

1195
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,920
while on the road.

1196
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,600
Cause I'm going to have probably two of them, maybe three of them with me on the road.

1197
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,640
And I don't know if I want to be doing package updates on three arch boxes because they're

1198
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,640
all running GNOME.

1199
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,640
Is that just...

1200
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,640
McDonald's?

1201
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,640
Yeah.

1202
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,640
I would totally do it to McDonald's.

1203
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,640
I could do that.

1204
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,640
Nice.

1205
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,640
All right.

1206
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,760
So any other Wayland or a GNOME 3.18 thoughts before I move on anything I missed?

1207
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,360
There's also other features that they're adding, but those are just ones that I don't think

1208
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,360
are going to be in the release notes.

1209
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,680
But I figure we'll all be talking about the ones that are in the release notes when it

1210
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,680
comes out.

1211
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,680
Yeah.

1212
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,680
So, okay.

1213
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,680
Going once, going twice.

1214
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,680
All right.

1215
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:07,140
Well then I will just, I'll just leave with a little mention that as, if you are curious

1216
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:12,120
on the state of the, of the whole road trip and where that's going, as I get kind of ramped

1217
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,960
up to it, I have posted a couple of videos up on our YouTube channel.

1218
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,960
I think I mentioned this at the end of last, last week.

1219
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,960
Or I guess this week.

1220
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,960
Yeah.

1221
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:22,960
I did.

1222
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,960
Oh no, I actually, that's right.

1223
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,960
I mentioned at the beginning of last.

1224
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:25,960
Boy, I'm an old man.

1225
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:26,960
Good.

1226
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,360
So you probably already know about this, but if you don't, there is a road trip playlist.

1227
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,440
I've only got two videos up there now.

1228
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,400
I'm in progress of making the third.

1229
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:38,000
And it's just updates because this is a whole new experience and there's a surprising connection.

1230
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,640
There's a maker aspect to it because there's a lot of build and cut and drill and solve.

1231
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,160
And there's an interesting technology aspect to it too.

1232
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,400
And of course for me it's also, I'm using Linux in a lot of spots.

1233
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:57,000
So it's really kind of been a fascinating kind of adventure so far and it's just starting.

1234
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,040
So I've documented two of it so far and I'll have a third up probably the next day or so.

1235
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,280
Connectivity is limited when I'm staying in the trailer, but I'll get it out eventually.

1236
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:09,040
So you can find that at the Jupiter Broadcasting YouTube channel, youtube.com slash Jupiter

1237
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,040
Broadcasting.

1238
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,520
There is a trailer walkthrough in the second update.

1239
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,600
It's a quick one.

1240
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,680
There's a quick trailer walkthrough.

1241
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,080
When it was empty, like I had not moved a single thing into it and I was parked out

1242
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,680
in the road in front of the studio and I'm sitting there with my Patreon poll.

1243
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,680
Don't ask.

1244
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,800
I'm taking a video.

1245
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,800
So you can find that.

1246
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,160
It's just on the Jupiter Broadcasting channel.

1247
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,160
And yeah.

1248
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,160
All right.

1249
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,160
Well that'll wrap us up.

1250
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,160
So let's see.

1251
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,440
So next week's Linux Unplugged.

1252
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:40,240
I'll be here for the 15th and then I will be on the road for episode 111 and episode

1253
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,200
112 for the ones recorded on the 22nd and the 29th.

1254
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,480
We should be doing that the same regular time I think though.

1255
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,760
So I think that all is if you listen live, oh, I could pre-warn you though.

1256
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:55,720
The download might be slightly delayed because the intention is for me to have a local recording

1257
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:59,560
on the road so that way my audio quality isn't that much worse when I'm doing the road show.

1258
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:04,480
But to do that, the show will have to pass through another set of editing to combine

1259
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,000
my remote audio track, Wes's local audio track and the Mumbles audio track and any computer

1260
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,340
audio that we have.

1261
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:15,320
So potentially four or five different tracks may have to be lined up by an editor and then

1262
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,120
delivered for production into video as well.

1263
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:24,920
So during the road trip there may be an eight hour delay or so on the release of the show.

1264
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,980
So maybe instead of coming out Tuesday night it might come out Wednesday morning or Wednesday

1265
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,520
midday or Wednesday afternoon, I'm not quite sure.

1266
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,840
We don't know yet because we haven't tried it yet.

1267
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,480
But just as a pre-warning for those of you that might notice that, I wanted to get you

1268
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,960
a couple of weeks' heads up because if you're a little bit behind by the time you're catching

1269
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,160
this, that'll be affecting you.

1270
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,240
But hopefully it won't be a big deal and you just grab the RSS feed and you'll get them

1271
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,240
when they come out.

1272
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,680
Or be here live for all the fun.

1273
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,680
That's right.

1274
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,840
That is the fastest way to get it.

1275
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,880
And there are clever solutions for recording the live stream too.

1276
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,560
Yeah, I know people do that.

1277
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,680
All right, well that'll wrap us up for this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1278
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,680
We'd love to get your feedback.

1279
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,680
You can go over to linuxactionshow.reddit.com and leave a note in the feedback thread there.

1280
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:06,200
Or you can go to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact and where you'll find a contact form

1281
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,300
for Linux Unplugs specifically.

1282
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:11,720
And that's always nice because then I filter just on the Unplugged show and I get all of

1283
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:12,720
that.

1284
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,720
So that's a good way to send your thoughts into the show.

1285
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,960
And don't forget we are live, like Wes just mentioned, over at jblive.tv.

1286
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,940
We do the show at 2 p.m. Pacific.

1287
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:23,280
You can get that converted to your local time at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1288
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,520
Any topics you want to also suggest, that subreddit's also great, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1289
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,640
Those are all the great places to get all the info.

1290
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,520
And at Jupiter Signal, for any last minute changes during the road trip or things like

1291
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,600
that, at Jupiter Signal is the network's news feed.

1292
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,280
All right everybody, well thank you so much for your time.

1293
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,960
Oh, wow, geez, hang up on me already, why don't you?

1294
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,960
Thanks for tuning in.

1295
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:59,040
We'll see you next week.

1296
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:21,680
Bye.

1297
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,840
Another suggestion for GPS tracking coming in right now.

1298
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,760
Boy, this is, we're all about the GPS tracking right here on the Linux Unplugged program.

1299
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,560
I tell you what, this is a serious endeavor because I want to make sure you guys know

1300
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,320
where I'm at so that way you can tell me the cool places to get brews, food, or meet up

1301
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,320
with me.

1302
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,260
So this is worth the effort.

1303
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,360
We got to spend a little time talking about this.

1304
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:44,160
While we all go vote for titles, JBtitles.com, we've got to get into this.

1305
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:52,640
This is kind of neat, so I could use this on the road trip somehow.

1306
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,440
You can use an APS droid to connect to the APRS network via different means, either via

1307
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,680
internet, Wi-Fi, or mobile data connection, audio connection between your radio and your

1308
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:05,480
smartphone, wow, how about that, or a Bluetooth serial connection to a TNC.

1309
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:10,120
Once connected, your beacon and presence see what stations are around and send and receive

1310
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:14,120
APRS messages.

1311
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:17,600
So this could be an APRS transmitter itself, it looks like.

1312
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,840
Here, I'm going to put the QR code on the screen if you guys want to grab that.

1313
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,840
I want to grab it too.

1314
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,840
Where's my phone?

1315
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,840
I want to get that.

1316
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,880
Come on, Google, do I have a QR code reader?

1317
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,800
Can you just tell Google to open a QR code reader?

1318
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,800
Yes.

1319
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,800
Okay, you think so?

1320
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,800
Let's see.

1321
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,800
Well, if you have one installed.

1322
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,200
All right, let's see if it does it.

1323
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,200
You ready, Wes?

1324
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,200
Let's see.

1325
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,200
Let's give it a chance.

1326
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,480
Okay, Google, open the QR code reader.

1327
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:48,560
Ah, I don't have one installed.

1328
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:53,000
And I like, though, the link it brings up is the QR reader for iPhone on the App Store.

1329
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,720
Mine brought up like a list of apps.

1330
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,720
I hate you, Wes!

1331
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,720
What did you say?

1332
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,720
Oh, you got the same thing.

1333
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,720
I just captured you, spy.

1334
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:04,000
You captured the same exact audio, and you got App Store play results, and look what

1335
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I got.

1336
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Now, how the hell is that?

1337
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I don't know.

1338
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
How did that happen?

1339
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,880
It should be the same Google now, you would think.

1340
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:15,840
Okay, Google, QR reader for Android.

1341
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:16,840
And okay, look what it gave me there.

1342
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,280
Yeah, I got the Kindle link, too.

1343
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,280
That's unhelpful.

1344
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,280
That's totally unhelpful.

1345
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,280
Very hit or miss.

1346
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,280
This is no good.

1347
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,280
This is no good.

1348
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,720
Anyways, I got to look into this app, because you know what, the Play Store should just

1349
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,720
have a freaking QR code reader built into it.

1350
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,720
It should, yes.

1351
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,280
Why doesn't it do that?

1352
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,280
QR code reader.

1353
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,280
Didn't get it.

1354
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,280
Hello?

1355
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,280
Hello?

1356
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,280
Hello?

1357
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,280
QR code reader.

1358
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,280
There we go.

1359
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,280
There we go.

1360
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,280
Now I'm in like, okay, now I'm in like Flynn.

1361
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,320
Oh, but there's so many to get, though.

1362
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,320
This is the problem.

1363
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,320
Oh, I know.

1364
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,800
There's too many, there's so many lovely QR code readers.

1365
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:56,920
All right, so, okay, has the chat, Chris last, non-vanilla camera apps have integrated

1366
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,920
QR code readers.

1367
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,920
Yeah, I know.

1368
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,040
I got, okay, anybody know if I have to be a ham to use this app?

1369
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,780
That's what I need to know right now, because this is happening.

1370
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:05,780
This is happening.

1371
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:11,360
According to a forum posted on the internet, it looks like you do.

1372
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:20,320
But does it actually have to, oh man, okay, so it's a $5 app if you get it from the Play

1373
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,320
Store.

1374
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:27,440
To make use, you'll need an APRS passcode for your call sign.

1375
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,440
Ah, there you go.

1376
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,440
There you go.

1377
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,840
Well, that kills that.

1378
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,120
That kills that.

1379
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:39,520
Does anybody else have something else that doesn't require to be a ham, to have a ham

1380
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:44,400
license and have an APRS, IS passcode?

1381
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,640
Because I don't think I'm doing that.

1382
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,720
Man, you guys got me all excited.

1383
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:53,440
All right, there's got to be a way to solve this, though, right?

1384
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,440
Come on, Wes, you got something on there?

1385
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,160
I know last week you were looking at the track car.

1386
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,160
Yeah, what is that?

1387
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,160
Remind me about the track car.

1388
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,160
I should look at that.

1389
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,360
Someone in Mumble Room linked something, a tutorial based on it, it looks like.

1390
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,360
Really?

1391
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,360
The track car.

1392
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,360
Now, did I...

1393
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,760
Yeah, I did, track car.

1394
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,160
I did save this from last week.

1395
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,160
Track car.

1396
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,000
Track car is an open source UOS tracking system for GPS tracking devices.

1397
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,080
It supports more than 80, but so is a client that allows you...

1398
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,080
All right, you know what?

1399
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,080
I'm desperate enough.

1400
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,360
I'll give this a shot.

1401
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:21,360
Let's give this a go.

1402
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:25,680
XTWV in the IRC linked us to something.

1403
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,360
Create your own vehicle fleet tracking management system which also links to track car.

1404
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,600
That is blowing my face off.

1405
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,600
All right, I'm putting this...

1406
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,560
You know what I hate about Google Play is they list my Samsung Edge.

1407
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,160
First of all, they use the OEMs like internal code names for your phones.

1408
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,160
Oh, yes.

1409
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,160
I hate that they do that.

1410
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,160
Hammerhead or whatever.

1411
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:48,280
Well, yeah, so if I click install here, like for my Edge, instead of saying the US...

1412
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:53,640
Instead of saying Samsung Edge, it says US Samsung SMG925T.

1413
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,640
Very helpful.

1414
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,420
Yeah, and then it's not even the right picture of my phone.

1415
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,200
It's a picture of a different model of my phone in a different color.

1416
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,000
So it's just super lame.

1417
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,200
Anyways, okay, so now I'm installing...

1418
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:12,080
This is called track car, and it's available for Android.

1419
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,720
Track car is a free open source server that supports more than 80 different protocols

1420
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,880
and GPS tracking devices.

1421
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,520
You can use the application with your own hosted instance of track car.

1422
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,520
So that might be something I could do is I could put it up on a droplet.

1423
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:25,600
Well, what do you think?

1424
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,080
Should I give this a shot, Wes?

1425
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,080
Yeah, I think so.

1426
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,080
Sounds interesting.

1427
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,120
I don't know if I feel like setting up my own server though, but I think I might try

1428
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,120
it.

1429
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,400
If the service setup isn't so bad, yeah, the app doesn't look so bad.

1430
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,200
Yeah, okay, so I have to give it a server to connect to, and a port, and a frequency.

1431
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,120
It's in the AUR.

1432
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,080
Mixed provider, so I can do mixed providers, so I have a mixed source of...

1433
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,080
It is an AUR, huh?

1434
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,080
Yeah.

1435
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,640
I think it runs on Java, so...

1436
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,720
This is getting more and more likely actually.

1437
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,000
I got to look into this.

1438
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,240
I got to look into this because the only problem is I'm going to be...

1439
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,760
I wonder what it does when I go to areas that don't have tracking.

1440
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:01,760
We should check out this...

1441
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,760
Maybe I call it private time.

1442
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,760
...Osmend too, maybe.

1443
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,760
Oh, Osmend, huh?

1444
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,760
Just while we have it invested.

1445
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,760
Yeah, let's take a look.

1446
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,760
What's this here?

1447
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,600
So this is coming from Mr. Odyssey Westray over there in Spokane.

1448
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,100
So this is Osmend...

1449
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,880
What is this thing here?

1450
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,880
This looks neat.

1451
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:19,400
An automated navigation directions and is a map and navigation application with access

1452
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,800
to the free worldwide high quality OpenStreetMaps data.

1453
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,800
Yeah.

1454
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:27,520
Okay, this is for offline.

1455
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,520
But I don't know if it does...

1456
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:34,040
It doesn't look like it broadcasts my location though, right?

1457
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,800
Yeah.

1458
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,000
I think for track cars...

1459
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,800
See with track car, I think the way it would work is I could have a page that people could

1460
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:44,240
go to and actually watch my trip in real time.

1461
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,240
Check in with Chris.

1462
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,240
And they'd be like, hey, I want to meet up with you.

1463
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,240
Okay, I really...

1464
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:50,200
Now I'm talking about this, I'm really getting excited about this.

1465
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:57,200
Okay, so here's a Gizmodo article that talks about different options.

1466
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:03,240
The Motorola i290 nationwide walkie-talkie, wireless web, GPS enabled, hands free...

1467
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,400
What's this?

1468
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,400
Get a phone.

1469
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,400
What is this?

1470
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,400
Instamapper.

1471
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,360
Have you heard of Instamapper, Wes?

1472
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,360
I have not.

1473
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,360
Instamapper.

1474
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,880
You can install it over the air.

1475
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,920
It's easy to use.

1476
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,320
Accu tracking is another one.

1477
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,320
Oh, Instamapper.

1478
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,320
Connection refused.

1479
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,320
What?

1480
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,320
Lame.

1481
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,320
Yeah, totes lame.

1482
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,320
Totes lame.

1483
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:26,200
I wonder if I have to use Internet Explorer.

1484
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,200
I'll try their HTTP.

1485
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,600
Yeah, Instamapper was a popular GPS tracking location service after nearly five years of

1486
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,600
operation.

1487
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,600
It shut down in 2012.

1488
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,600
Womp, womp.

1489
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,840
Wow, how old is this article?

1490
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,840
This article is...

1491
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,060
Oh, my gosh.

1492
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:43,000
You guys, chat room, look at the gear they recommended you use in this.

1493
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,700
What is that?

1494
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,880
That's like a Motorola feature phone from 2002.

1495
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,640
Guys, how old is this article?

1496
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,200
Chat room.

1497
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,200
Ooh, check in with Chris.com.

1498
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,200
I love it.

1499
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,400
Check in with Chris.com.

1500
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,400
Is that available?

1501
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,400
Somebody grab that for me.

1502
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,400
Jeez.

1503
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,400
Let's see here.

1504
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,440
High quality, low cost GPS tracking with AccuTracking.

1505
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,120
Track GPS trackers or cell phones.

1506
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:07,760
Real time location, history reports, emails, text, and alerts.

1507
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,760
AccuTracking.

1508
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:09,760
This might be it.

1509
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,880
They have starter kits, a pre-configured tracker for you.

1510
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,880
What's the price like?

1511
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:14,880
I don't know.

1512
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,160
I'm going to go look on their Amazon page, but here's what I don't want.

1513
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:25,720
This looks like it's for private tracking, you know, to track like a fleet of businesses.

1514
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:26,720
Right.

1515
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,280
Whereas you want something that you can easily share.

1516
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,280
Yeah.

1517
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,280
Yeah.

1518
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,280
Oh, that's neat, though.

1519
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,280
Here's what I love about this.

1520
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,280
I've seen this.

1521
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,280
Verizon has this, too.

1522
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,320
This is so cool.

1523
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,940
This tracker, look at that, Wes.

1524
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:37,940
This tracker plugs into...

1525
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:38,940
Ooh, industrial.

1526
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:43,080
It plugs into your ODB2 port, your diagnostic port, gets power from that, has a SIM card

1527
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,920
in it and a GPS in it, and it can also do a mic.

1528
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,920
Oh, dang.

1529
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:47,920
Wow.

1530
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,400
It's free to go, no contract, no activation fee, so it's 77 bucks for this off of Amazon.

1531
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,840
Prepaid SIM card is included.

1532
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:54,840
What?

1533
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,840
Ooh.

1534
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:56,840
And what is this?

1535
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:00,440
Real-time 24-7 GPS tracking, vehicle diagnostic data included.

1536
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,440
Oh, my God, that's cool.

1537
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,440
That's actually pretty handy.

1538
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:07,520
Geofence speed, ignition, AC unplugged, SOS panic, check engine light on.

1539
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,520
That's neat.

1540
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,520
With the DTC code.

1541
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,520
Detailed tracking reports.

1542
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,640
You'll never be able to hide from Andrew, I guess.

1543
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:16,540
Excellent reception with built-in GSM and GPS antenna.

1544
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:22,000
So here's the thing, though, is I still don't think it's doing public maps.

1545
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Right.

1546
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,080
Would you have to give people your login to their service to be able to see it or whatever?

1547
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,920
Yeah, that seems like a deal-breaker to me.

1548
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,040
That seems like...

1549
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,040
That's no good.

1550
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,280
That's no good.

1551
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:36,040
So I'm gonna stick with the track car and see how that goes.

1552
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,400
I'm a little concerned about that.

1553
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,400
We will see.

1554
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:47,000
I'm a little concerned.
