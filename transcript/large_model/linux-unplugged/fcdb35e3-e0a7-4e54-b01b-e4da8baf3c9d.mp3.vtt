WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.740
What's on your mind wimpy Chris and Colonel Linux probably know the answer to this. So I've got an old microphone

00:07.620 --> 00:09.140
with

00:09.140 --> 00:17.860
Screw hole in the bottom of it that I imagine is some sort of standard. Is it a standard? Yeah. Yeah

00:18.600 --> 00:21.200
Yeah, it's sort of like you like for like mounting on a tripod

00:22.300 --> 00:26.060
yeah, yeah, what I was thinking is could I get like

00:26.060 --> 00:32.480
an arm that I can attach to the desk and screw this into it and do I have to buy anything

00:33.120 --> 00:35.960
Clever or specific or is it just a general?

00:36.720 --> 00:38.980
Thing no, does it look yeah

00:38.980 --> 00:44.780
I was gonna say is it does it look like it's about five-eighths of an inch because that is a really great arm

00:45.060 --> 00:47.060
That uses a standard

00:47.080 --> 00:49.500
standard microphone five-eighths inch mount

00:50.460 --> 00:54.360
Okay, I'm gonna have to get my granddad's ruler out of the garage to tell you

00:54.360 --> 00:58.620
The chances are if there's a screw hole at the bottom of the microphone

00:58.620 --> 01:00.100
I highly doubt it would be anything else

01:00.100 --> 01:05.340
But just the same you may like you have any other microphone stand that you can look and see

01:05.780 --> 01:09.680
There it is. There is a standard and I believe it's five-eighths of an inch

01:10.220 --> 01:15.880
No, this is an old. This is an old mic. Oh, I see. Yeah. Okay, that looks about that looks about similar

01:16.740 --> 01:21.420
So the reason I'm saying about getting my granddad's thing out is because we're metric over here now for me

01:21.420 --> 01:25.860
So although so although we can speak in feet and inches and all the rest of it

01:26.120 --> 01:30.260
When you get down to sub inch measurements, I've got no idea what that looks like

01:34.860 --> 01:36.860
If you wanted if you wanted our a

01:37.500 --> 01:43.140
Desktop boom arm though. That is what I would get because it comes with both the clamp and the mount so you can either screw

01:43.140 --> 01:48.820
It into the desk or you can clamp it clamp it down onto the edge of a desk and it's still only 50 bucks

01:48.820 --> 01:51.380
Bound to the wire. Yeah, I prefer to some what about?

01:53.080 --> 01:55.080
You're gonna roll today

01:55.840 --> 02:02.520
Because of the photo we were taking before the show started I think they could cut things rolling I can see why you've got three kids

02:04.900 --> 02:06.900
I'm a Scorpio

02:08.900 --> 02:10.900
What about isolators

02:10.900 --> 02:18.180
The the the rings that you mount the oh, yeah, like the spider mount. Yeah. Yeah of any good. Well, they'll help you from stuff

02:18.180 --> 02:22.140
Like like any kind of noise transfer like this from the table or like, you know

02:22.140 --> 02:25.140
When we when we this is like me picking up Angela's water bottle

02:25.980 --> 02:28.980
They'll help isolate. Yeah. Yeah, I can't really hear that

02:28.980 --> 02:32.100
So the thing is is that obviously I've got my keyboard and what have you on the desk?

02:32.100 --> 02:37.020
I'm thinking yeah, I might want to be typing and clattering away. Yeah, I'm doing yeah

02:37.020 --> 02:41.380
Yeah, it's nice to have a spider mount if especially if you're not doing video then, you know, that's the only reason I don't have

02:41.380 --> 02:43.460
One release because they're horrible in on video

02:44.300 --> 02:47.540
We cover half your face in front of a camera. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

02:47.540 --> 02:51.740
I haven't got that to worry about and frankly if anything covered my face up. I have a I have a face for radio

02:55.220 --> 02:57.220
Yeah, and what Mike are you using

02:58.100 --> 03:00.100
I've told this once before but I

03:00.300 --> 03:01.340
Couldn't tell you

03:01.340 --> 03:07.100
Some old old crap that I had when I used to be in a band, but I got out the loft. There's no

03:07.740 --> 03:11.100
Brand or model number on it. It's just a generic mic

03:11.820 --> 03:13.820
that I've

03:14.380 --> 03:16.980
Jimmy rigged with some USB adapters. Hmm

03:18.580 --> 03:24.220
Yeah, I don't know I think it was at the 80 to 80 to 20 is like the what is the 8 there's an 80

03:24.220 --> 03:29.460
That's a good USB mount a mic 80 20 20 20 20 20 and then they have the 80 20 20 usb

03:29.460 --> 03:31.460
Which has a built-in

03:31.540 --> 03:34.340
Analog to digital converter. That's nice

03:35.460 --> 03:37.780
Play on Linux is switching to Java. Do you guys see that?

03:39.460 --> 03:41.460
Really yeah

03:42.020 --> 03:47.100
Yeah, and play on Linux is switching it. I know I know they even have they even have a little of the screenshot up here

03:48.580 --> 03:53.540
so I guess part of the reason is because Ubuntu 1510 is gonna drop Python 2 and

03:54.300 --> 03:56.300
Their main problem was WX Python

03:56.300 --> 04:03.100
Even WX Python 3.0 does not support Python 3x play on Linux is a version code is really ugly and we don't want to maintain

04:03.100 --> 04:04.380
It any longer

04:04.380 --> 04:08.780
Moreover because of bad design and changing WX Python to another library as much as it takes as much effort

04:08.780 --> 04:10.780
We can completely rewrite the program

04:11.180 --> 04:14.140
We really want to have clean code for play on Linux 5 Python is really great

04:14.140 --> 04:19.420
But working with a damn not dynamically typed has a lot of drawbacks when it comes to design and strong designed architecture

04:19.420 --> 04:22.140
So they're gonna have the core written in Java

04:22.140 --> 04:25.500
Play on Linux 5 scripts would be written in Python. Good bye bash

04:26.300 --> 04:31.660
With a play on Linux 4 version 4 bash script interpreter would be written in Python for backwards compatibility

04:33.580 --> 04:36.060
Play on Linux going Java, this is gonna kill it you think

04:38.860 --> 04:40.380
I

04:40.380 --> 04:43.820
I've got so many things going through my mind at the moment. Um,

04:44.620 --> 04:48.460
Well, I'm familiar with I'm very familiar with Python and Wix and

04:48.460 --> 04:53.980
Wix never really delivered on its promise. We unfortunately we have an application at work that we developed in Wix and

04:54.540 --> 05:01.100
We realized now that was not such a smart move, but you know six years ago that that looked like the right thing to do

05:02.060 --> 05:05.580
If we were doing it today, we'd use one of the um, cute

05:06.540 --> 05:09.900
Uh wrappers for for Python. We'd still use Python though

05:11.020 --> 05:13.740
Um, but going to Java because of uh,

05:13.740 --> 05:18.300
a widget library issue seems like um, an unusual

05:19.260 --> 05:23.900
Rationalization, right? I'm wondering if there must have been a preference in the team for Java already that this has made it easier

05:23.900 --> 05:29.420
If they've got if they're strong on Java programming skills, then that would be the reason why it makes sense

05:29.580 --> 05:33.020
Yeah, so why Java not another language? As I said Java is static in a compiled language

05:33.020 --> 05:34.700
It means it's easy to write clean code

05:34.700 --> 05:38.700
And it also means that a large part of the problems are detected during compilation to avoid bugs

05:38.700 --> 05:43.500
But Java is good choice for several other reasons. The code would be compatible with Linux and OS 10 with no effort. Hmm

05:43.500 --> 05:49.340
I guess OS 10 is an issue. It's also true of Python. Yeah, frankly. Uh, it's the most widely spread language

05:49.420 --> 05:53.900
There's another reason for them and there are many frameworks and libraries we could use to measure code quality to run tests

05:54.860 --> 05:57.180
Boy, those are not super strong reasons in my opinion

05:58.060 --> 05:59.180
and

05:59.180 --> 06:03.500
Because a lot of people use it as not an exception. Yeah. Yeah, a lot of that applies. Yeah

06:03.500 --> 06:05.020
Yeah, it's a lot of people don't use it

06:05.020 --> 06:08.700
A lot of people use it as not an exception. Yeah. Yeah, a lot of that applies. Yeah

06:09.260 --> 06:11.260
I saw a banner. I saw a banner

06:11.260 --> 06:17.100
I don't know if it was an advert or something from Oracle saying, you know Java on six billion devices

06:17.980 --> 06:22.780
But of course most of those are Android which they would contest is actually Java

06:23.980 --> 06:28.060
I think it's Mac support play on Linux wants to target Mac OS

06:29.820 --> 06:32.460
Otherwise, why would you just use a big gaming platform?

06:32.460 --> 06:34.540
No, that's why I think it's silly

06:34.540 --> 06:39.100
But you know, I have talked to the CEO of crossover and it is what keeps their business afloat

06:39.180 --> 06:41.660
In fact, he told me that if it wasn't for the Mac sales, they probably would have shut down

06:43.020 --> 06:46.060
They still make their Linux product, but they make the majority of their revenue on the Mac sales

06:46.620 --> 06:51.660
I think it's just a larger user base. But you know, the Macs have such crappy video cards across the board on average

06:53.740 --> 06:57.420
So I yeah, I mean half of their line just ships with only Intel graphics

06:57.420 --> 07:02.540
Qt seems like it would have been a lot more sensical and I just don't get Java. So unless it's for what was 10, don't you think?

07:04.540 --> 07:06.540
Well, like I say

07:06.540 --> 07:08.540
we maintain

07:08.860 --> 07:14.460
Multi-platform tools in Python at work not Mac as it happens, but Windows and Linux

07:15.500 --> 07:17.500
and there's

07:17.500 --> 07:20.460
There are some that well the same and similar issues

07:20.460 --> 07:23.980
We have slightly more complex issues than most because of the nature of the world

07:23.980 --> 07:30.140
We do so the abstractions that we have to do a very low down sort of at the at the hardware layer

07:32.140 --> 07:34.140
But

07:34.140 --> 07:36.940
Maintaining a multi-platform application on

07:37.900 --> 07:40.860
You know Python application or Java application

07:41.820 --> 07:45.660
Is about the same really if you're not doing anything too clever

07:45.660 --> 07:49.500
It sounds like they're using it mostly for their front end rather than the back end

07:49.500 --> 07:53.020
So I'd have thought well, there's lots of languages that would have been straightforward

07:54.220 --> 07:58.540
But yeah, maybe they've got people on the team that are particularly proficient in Java

07:58.540 --> 08:02.780
and that's why it makes sense because they can speed up the development and

08:03.580 --> 08:09.900
You know rapidity of their iterations maybe so every year this Mother's Day thing gets me

08:10.620 --> 08:12.720
Every year I have palpitations

08:12.720 --> 08:18.320
Where I think oh shit a brick. I've forgotten Mother's Day. Mm-hmm. Well, here's so much trouble

08:19.120 --> 08:25.120
And then I remember actually we did that three months ago. Yeah, I was just gonna say isn't yours like

08:26.000 --> 08:26.960
before

08:26.960 --> 08:28.000
March

08:28.000 --> 08:29.200
Yeah

08:29.200 --> 08:36.320
That is hilarious, but Twitter Twitter Facebook and Google Plus are just full of it's Mother's Day. Happy Mother's Day

08:36.320 --> 08:44.320
And you just have this. Oh shit moment. Yep, and every it's it's a new thing ever since I've been on the social networks

08:44.320 --> 08:46.320
in the last three years and you suddenly think oh

08:47.200 --> 08:50.400
Well, and it's just getting worse too like this Mother's Day

08:51.360 --> 08:54.640
I don't know. I think it's no somebody's flapping. Um

08:55.360 --> 08:57.040
it's like

08:57.040 --> 09:03.840
Everybody was saying happy Mother's Day. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's

09:03.840 --> 09:10.720
Everybody was saying happy Mother's Day. Yeah, it's it's no longer a big deal. It's no longer just a happy Mother's Day to your

09:11.280 --> 09:16.000
Moms. Yeah, it's everybody out there if you're a mom you get a yeah and like I don't

09:16.880 --> 09:20.800
It's too much. I think it's yeah, I think it's the homework holiday that i'm just like not

09:21.360 --> 09:25.520
Interested in oh you say that then if I hadn't gotten you anything you would have been interested in no, no

09:25.600 --> 09:30.400
No private celebration is fine. Oh, yeah. Yeah, but yeah, I don't know. I just private celebration where you get something

09:30.400 --> 09:34.480
So publicly making it awkward happy Mother's Day. Yeah. Yeah

09:35.840 --> 09:41.760
Yeah, yeah, because I just didn't I didn't want to say happy Mother's Day to my mother-in-law my mom on Facebook

09:42.480 --> 09:46.080
You know and I do want to say happy Mother's Day to some some friends of mine

09:46.720 --> 09:49.360
But I don't want to I don't want to do an all-encompassing one

09:49.360 --> 09:52.960
And I don't just want to do them because then other other friends might be like why aren't this?

09:53.040 --> 09:56.720
Why isn't she saying it to me? Like it's just stupid. It's complicated. I just send private messages

09:57.040 --> 09:59.040
The answer to this is a php script

09:59.040 --> 10:01.040
Yeah, you're right. Probably

10:05.920 --> 10:11.920
Welcome to linux unplugged your weekly linux talk show that's converting one mac user over to linux at a time

10:12.480 --> 10:17.920
My name is Chris and I'm Angela. Hey there, Angela. You are the mac user here. I am speaking of yes

10:18.720 --> 10:21.760
Guilty and I figured you know if I could start there and work my way out

10:22.000 --> 10:27.200
Okay, that's one person at a time one and actually it's not only not only if we switch one person but so far it's stuck

10:27.200 --> 10:32.480
Yeah, yeah, we're going to talk about that. Angela just recently switched over to linux. She's rocking a lenovo yoga

10:33.040 --> 10:35.920
Three and we'll get an update from her and she's got like three or four

10:36.480 --> 10:40.400
Tough questions linux desktop questions that she's going to pose to our virtual lug today

10:40.640 --> 10:45.200
Put them to the test and see if they can solve some of the problems that she's ran into in her switch to linux

10:45.920 --> 10:49.760
And I think you'll be surprised and not surprised at some of them plus in the show

10:49.760 --> 10:53.200
We're going to talk about ubuntu's jump into the internet of things with their good buddy

10:53.740 --> 10:55.600
microsoft

10:55.600 --> 11:00.640
yeah, microsoft and a canonical announced a pretty big partnership along with ge

11:01.120 --> 11:06.320
And others to ship ubuntu on internet of things devices. What the hell does that mean? And what does this fridge do?

11:07.040 --> 11:08.160
We're going to talk about all of that

11:08.160 --> 11:12.080
Plus we're going to talk about the chip computer the world's first nine dollar computer that runs linux

11:12.320 --> 11:16.800
And what some of the cool things we could do with that plus we've got some follow-up some catch up some feedback

11:17.200 --> 11:20.880
It's a really really big show. So before we go any further it is now

11:20.880 --> 11:25.520
Our duty to bring in our mumble room time appropriate greetings virtual lug

11:26.800 --> 11:29.920
Time hello greetings. Hello guys. Hi guys. Hi

11:30.240 --> 11:32.480
Hey, uh, this is a story we've been following on the show

11:32.480 --> 11:34.080
And I just want to do a little follow-up

11:34.080 --> 11:36.080
before we get into all of the meat just to kind of

11:36.800 --> 11:41.760
Keep a trail going for this new debbie and project leader that was elected recently and the whole talk around

11:42.160 --> 11:45.120
Ppa is coming over to debbie and well

11:45.200 --> 11:49.520
He sat down over at linux.com for an interview and they asked all kinds of questions

11:49.520 --> 11:51.680
I'll link to that in the show notes if you guys want to read them

11:51.920 --> 11:55.280
But I wanted to get right in on this ppa thing because I think this is some interest to some of us

11:55.760 --> 11:59.280
Uh, he says there's hundreds of ppas for abundance the question will they work with debbie?

12:00.160 --> 12:05.600
Mcgovern says I think this is unlikely although debbie has a good relationship with ubuntu and other downstream distributions

12:05.600 --> 12:07.040
We have different focuses

12:07.040 --> 12:11.200
Keeping all of the main libraries in sync would create a lot of effort to allow this to happen

12:11.440 --> 12:14.480
And it's not something we really have time to do while developing our own distribution

12:14.880 --> 12:18.480
So because of the library differences ubuntu ppas probably won't work on debbie

12:18.480 --> 12:22.640
And how difficult will it be for developers who have ubuntu ppas to port them over to debbie?

12:22.720 --> 12:26.080
And he was asked Mcgovern answers. I don't think it would be particularly hard

12:26.240 --> 12:27.520
But they're really two different things

12:27.520 --> 12:31.760
Essentially the work is creating a debbie and compliant package and then a lot of the preliminary work has been done

12:32.080 --> 12:34.720
By by creating the ubuntu package anyways, so ang

12:35.520 --> 12:37.520
Yeah using ubuntu but on ubuntu

12:37.840 --> 12:40.960
There is a way you can get this thing called a ppa like a personal package archive

12:41.040 --> 12:44.000
And what that is is like say you wanted to get a version of chrome

12:44.560 --> 12:47.840
And you wanted to make sure you always got the latest version of chrome when google pushed out a new one

12:47.840 --> 12:49.840
You could go get a chrome ppa

12:49.920 --> 12:53.360
And it's a personal archive that you could go then get that software from google

12:53.440 --> 12:57.600
And then they would keep updating it for you directly from their servers when you do part of your regular system updates

12:57.840 --> 13:01.920
So these ppas are like little ways for software makers to put out software to linux desktop

13:02.000 --> 13:05.200
And then people to come sort of subscribe to it to get updates. It's kind of nice, right?

13:05.920 --> 13:11.600
And so but ubuntu is like one of the few distributions that does this kind of system, but ubuntu is based on debian

13:12.240 --> 13:16.420
And debian is considering implementing a system like this. So debian users have sort of the same functionality

13:16.420 --> 13:18.820
Mm-hmm, but the two systems will not be compatible

13:19.140 --> 13:23.140
So you have two systems similar name similar function, but if you make a ppa for ubuntu

13:23.220 --> 13:25.220
You won't be able to have that ppa run on debian

13:26.020 --> 13:29.220
Wow, that's dumb. Yeah, that's what happens. They can

13:30.020 --> 13:30.900
Why do they conflict?

13:30.900 --> 13:37.140
Why can't they both be subscribed because the ubuntu computers have a different set of libraries that the programs use than the debian computers

13:37.780 --> 13:40.580
And they can't the developers can't expect both to be on. Oh, I see

13:41.140 --> 13:44.500
It's kind of unfortunate though, right? I mean from an end user's perspective that seems a little confusing

13:44.500 --> 13:47.060
But you either run ubuntu or you run debian, right?

13:47.380 --> 13:48.820
so

13:48.820 --> 13:53.300
You you from the the what the so what that actually means is exactly right is there's going to be a lot more

13:53.380 --> 13:57.460
There'll always be more stuff available for ubuntu because there's more people on the desktop using ubuntu things like that

13:57.780 --> 14:03.300
Is this one way for like software makers to keep a pulse on how many people are actually using the product?

14:03.620 --> 14:06.180
Yeah for sure because they're going to get download stats off the repo and stuff

14:06.260 --> 14:08.260
So you're going to see every time somebody connects to pull off

14:08.260 --> 14:10.820
So it gives you an idea of how many people are keeping their software up to date

14:10.900 --> 14:13.140
So it gets you an idea of how many users are out there using it

14:13.140 --> 14:14.820
Hmm. Yeah

14:14.820 --> 14:16.820
Uh, yeah mumble room any thoughts?

14:17.380 --> 14:21.540
Well, the download thing they don't really give you much information at all. Like they give you like a simple download

14:21.620 --> 14:25.220
Yeah, but it's not you get a number, you know, you get an idea of how many people have downloaded that package

14:25.460 --> 14:27.300
But there's no real great metrics

14:27.300 --> 14:32.340
I just hope that debian doesn't call it ppa. That way there's no confusion. Well, they have been calling them ppa so far

14:33.060 --> 14:36.820
I think they're just describing what they're going to be but if they call them something else

14:36.900 --> 14:40.420
That would be much better because then there wouldn't be any confusion. I'm like, well this ppa is for ubuntu

14:40.420 --> 14:43.540
And there's no debian. Yeah. Yeah, we'll follow it. We'll see what happens

14:44.260 --> 14:46.500
the thing is in order to submit a

14:47.220 --> 14:52.180
Package to an ubuntu ppa for building you have to create a debian source package

14:52.820 --> 14:59.540
So once i've done that I could send that to the ubuntu ppa system and whatever debians

15:00.260 --> 15:07.300
You know use a package repository is dpa. I like it's the same. It's the same. It's the same thing

15:07.860 --> 15:08.660
Yeah

15:08.660 --> 15:10.660
Uh, what would we call it the other day?

15:10.820 --> 15:12.020
dump

15:12.020 --> 15:16.260
Definitely user-managed packages. I like that a lot. Hey, did you take a dump?

15:17.220 --> 15:19.780
Yeah, put that in the dump. That's pretty good, actually

15:21.540 --> 15:25.300
All right, uh, well, uh, we we have talked a lot about wayland on the show

15:25.460 --> 15:29.540
We've talked about how great it's going to be how it's going to change everything. Well mandre writes in

15:30.100 --> 15:32.900
Says hello mom barum and chris and angela. Yay

15:33.140 --> 15:37.940
He says why do all of you want to switch to wayland so freaking badly when replacing x

15:37.940 --> 15:45.940
Do you not want to replace it with something more useful wayland throws all usefulness and even usability out the freaking window in wayland

15:46.100 --> 15:48.900
Security trumps all always performance does too

15:48.900 --> 15:53.540
It seems ironically most implementations will probably not even support online updating and in the core of wayland

15:53.540 --> 15:59.940
We have only very basic functionality drawing onto a buffer support for input devices and some very limited output protocols

16:00.260 --> 16:04.180
Wayland is inherently inflexible if anyone wants to add additional functionality

16:04.180 --> 16:10.180
They must do it in the compositor the window manager and then publish the protocol if this is if this is even up to all

16:10.260 --> 16:14.180
Other compositors window managers and etc to then support that protocol

16:14.420 --> 16:18.500
What if the two compositor teams and the window manager teams write two different protocols to do the same thing?

16:19.060 --> 16:26.420
Naturally, there's some basic functionality missing in wayland wayland does not support screenshotting wayland doesn't support screen recording global hotkeys clipboards

16:26.500 --> 16:32.980
I think or gamma correction all has to be done in the compositor and this is just very basic functionality

16:32.980 --> 16:38.500
But to finish it all off wayland is not network transparent and networking is a nightmare

16:38.580 --> 16:44.980
Don't you realize that this is the future and in the future more devices are interconnected and network oriented not less security

16:45.280 --> 16:48.020
shmurity performance smormons mandre

16:50.500 --> 16:51.460
Wow

16:51.460 --> 16:53.940
This guy does not like wayland. What is wayland?

16:54.180 --> 16:59.060
Like what would you compare it to wayland's what's going to get the just in real simple terms wayland's is what's going to get stuff

16:59.060 --> 17:01.540
Up on your screen. That's what just going to get the graph of this right here

17:01.540 --> 17:04.260
This is a this is an x11 graphics environment, right?

17:04.340 --> 17:06.980
So when I move this window around on my screen, that's x11

17:07.060 --> 17:11.460
That's drawing that on my screen wayland's going to replace that but it's basically a whole new way to do it

17:11.860 --> 17:18.020
Totally new totally new work needs to be done on the on the desktop environment ends on their compositors and mandre brings up some good

17:18.100 --> 17:22.580
Points the stuff that comes so with x you get some of the stuff just built in by having x you get some of these

17:22.580 --> 17:24.580
Features and with wayland you have to write some of your own

17:24.580 --> 17:32.260
Hmm, uh, and so on that did not ever offer those or is it just because it's currently not available as a standard stable release anyway

17:32.260 --> 17:36.100
Well, I think because the wayland developers think that it's not up to the server to do that stuff

17:36.100 --> 17:38.420
It's up to the clients to do that stuff. You want to do screen recording?

17:38.500 --> 17:42.340
It should be the client. It should be the composer that does that not the back end infrastructure

17:43.700 --> 17:49.940
Well, the the client is definitely the thing that should take care of something when it comes to user facing interaction

17:49.940 --> 17:55.140
But no any keyboard or mouse or interactions with hardware to the compositor

17:55.540 --> 17:57.380
I'll go through kms and uvdev

17:57.380 --> 18:03.380
It is kernel then it goes up to the compositor which it then filters out throughout the wayland client clients

18:03.940 --> 18:06.740
And did you guys see a friend of the show martin the kwin developer?

18:07.220 --> 18:10.420
Just said after years of work. This was two days ago master

18:10.500 --> 18:13.540
The master kwin branch now has become a proper wayland compositor

18:13.860 --> 18:19.780
So kwin and gnome both have rock and wayland support and they're doing those things in the compositor

18:19.780 --> 18:23.620
That's where they're getting it done at and so there must be a benefit, right?

18:23.700 --> 18:28.340
Because why is is it just a way to redo something and potentially make it better. I could be wrong

18:28.420 --> 18:32.340
I think the real true benefit is they're trying to build something that can last 20 years

18:32.580 --> 18:36.280
And so if you build some of this stuff in on how we do it in 2014 or 2015

18:36.820 --> 18:39.860
Well, then in 2025 or whatever we're 2030 when we're using it

18:39.860 --> 18:42.500
Maybe we want a completely different way to record our screens

18:42.900 --> 18:47.140
If you do that in the desktop environment, that's and that's just my generic way of saying the composite or whatever

18:47.140 --> 18:52.740
That's much more nimble you can make the change there much quicker than pushing it out to the server that affects every linux distribution

18:52.820 --> 18:56.600
On the planet, right? So instead of just affecting a desktop environment

18:57.700 --> 18:59.460
That's also the x

18:59.460 --> 19:03.780
The x architecture is kind of from the 80s, which is based on x86

19:04.260 --> 19:10.580
So all the code is very very old and it's all insecure by default wayland is trying to be secure by default

19:10.900 --> 19:15.620
And that's why it's a little bit hard for wayland programs at the moment since everything is a little bit immature

19:15.620 --> 19:18.580
Yeah, in order to communicate between each other. Yeah, it is

19:18.660 --> 19:22.820
That's basically the issue is like sometimes the security is just a little too tight and it makes doing what they're trying to do

19:22.900 --> 19:24.900
a little impossible

19:25.860 --> 19:28.120
I don't know didn't one of the x developers

19:28.720 --> 19:35.060
Themselves that is working on wayland denounce how x was doing their own code in itself

19:35.220 --> 19:40.580
Yeah, and then another benefit I see is that if it's not on it's not on

19:40.580 --> 19:46.580
Uh, if the client needs to change and adapt then wayland doesn't need to change and adapt that way

19:47.060 --> 19:49.940
They kind of future proof it anyway, right?

19:50.020 --> 19:54.260
So if something changes you don't have to worry about the the graphics layer

19:54.340 --> 19:58.740
the other advantage too is if you're building for a very extreme unique use case something like

19:59.700 --> 20:04.180
You know an embedded device that's maybe like a small embedded screen. That's a presentation mode

20:04.340 --> 20:09.060
You don't have to modify the entire back end infrastructure to accommodate this one off. You just build that into that

20:09.060 --> 20:13.380
Uh compositor that that particular device is using I mean it makes sense to me, but it's a big transition

20:13.860 --> 20:18.580
Yeah, q5 sys producer q5 sys says wait till wayland gets rolled into system d I am

20:18.660 --> 20:23.380
I'm hoping they roll in this kernel. You'll enroll in wayland. Just get all one big linux d. Well, we'll call it the d

20:24.180 --> 20:25.620
It'll be good

20:25.620 --> 20:27.620
I hope I get the d

20:27.940 --> 20:33.300
Hey, you know what that's a shot everybody. Hello take a shot. Uh, so so, you know for me

20:34.020 --> 20:36.340
I don't understand the problem because um

20:36.340 --> 20:42.900
They often already uses wayland and they already have all the features like uh, yep screen sharing and all that

20:42.980 --> 20:46.260
So so it's actually not as big of an issue

20:47.220 --> 20:51.620
Yeah, implement it and some right I guess in practice it hasn't it actually hasn't been that bad

20:52.820 --> 20:54.820
Yeah, and security is you know

20:55.940 --> 21:02.100
With all the like nsa stuff. I think security needs a graph focus because really if you

21:02.660 --> 21:04.100
read some of the

21:04.100 --> 21:06.500
recent breaches, uh

21:06.500 --> 21:12.740
You know taking security as a backseat because of uh, usability is not a good thing

21:12.900 --> 21:17.300
Just it's not a big deal. I think basically if you look at it this way

21:17.460 --> 21:21.540
Oh, and there is a point where you have to start you have to start taking it. Yes security seriously

21:21.860 --> 21:25.300
um and and you have to start making compromises and I also think that uh,

21:25.380 --> 21:31.380
We sometimes get trapped in dogma thinking things will never change that we can't build a better system once we've built the first version

21:31.380 --> 21:36.260
Uh, there's things as 2.0 and 3.0 releases and things can change before we go any further

21:36.340 --> 21:39.460
We have uh, I have some things I want to dig into with angela and her switch to linux

21:39.780 --> 21:42.420
Uh, but first I want to mention our first sponsor and that's ting

21:42.660 --> 21:43.060
You know

21:43.060 --> 21:48.200
Go to linux.ting.com right now if you would that'll support this show and give you a 25 discount linux.ting.com

21:49.540 --> 21:52.580
Ting's mobile that makes sense. We've been using ting for more than a couple of years

21:52.580 --> 21:54.660
We've saved over two thousand dollars by switching to ting

21:54.820 --> 21:58.420
You can find out how much you would switch by using their savings calculator right there on their homepage

21:58.420 --> 22:03.220
When you go to linux.ting.com ting is truly mobile that makes sense because there's no contract

22:03.540 --> 22:09.060
And there's no early termination fee because there's no contract and then you just pay for your usage your minutes your messages and your megabytes

22:09.300 --> 22:14.180
And whatever bucket you fall into that's what you pay and it's really easy because it's just a flat six dollars for the line

22:14.420 --> 22:16.740
Yep, and you can bring your own device. Yeah, really nice

22:16.820 --> 22:19.800
And if you bring your own device, you'll get a 25 service credit by visiting linux.ting.com

22:20.740 --> 22:22.740
And that'll probably pay for more than your first month

22:23.060 --> 22:25.700
At least and they've got gsm networks now and cdma

22:25.700 --> 22:30.980
So you can bring over the iphone or your favorite android phone. It's we've got an iphone on ting

22:30.980 --> 22:34.660
We've got an hdc one on ting and a nexus 5 on ting

22:34.980 --> 22:39.620
And they're just all great because we only pay for our usage. We're on wi-fi a lot

22:39.620 --> 22:44.100
So we're saving a ton on data and voice minutes, which is really we use one for our nanny

22:44.500 --> 22:48.500
Yeah, like it's a nice little perk benefit for her that she doesn't have to pay for her cell phone

22:48.580 --> 22:51.220
Yeah, and we look like we do all ours. Meanwhile, it's six dollars for that line

22:51.220 --> 22:55.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I can I can communicate with her whenever I need to that's key

22:55.860 --> 23:01.220
You know like that that was the most important thing is that she had a good reliable phone and phone service

23:01.540 --> 23:05.300
So yeah, so and you can the other nice thing too is once you get somebody on ting

23:05.380 --> 23:09.140
Uh, they're set because if they ever run into any kind of problems ting has no whole customer support

23:09.220 --> 23:13.940
So you just call them at 1855 ting ftw and a real human being answers your phone and I like that

23:14.180 --> 23:17.540
They're there. They're set up. They're ready to answer your problems. I think that's a pretty nice perk

23:17.540 --> 23:23.140
Uh, they also have all the features you'd expect like voicemail caller id tethering hotspot three-way calling call forwarding all the other features

23:23.300 --> 23:27.060
That you might want but then a whole bunch more like you can turn devices on and off if you don't want to pay for

23:27.060 --> 23:28.340
Them this is really slick

23:28.340 --> 23:30.340
Like if you get one of ting's mi-fi devices

23:30.420 --> 23:32.660
Because it's six dollars to have data in your pocket

23:32.900 --> 23:35.700
And then if you're going to go a couple of months where you don't need data in your pocket

23:35.700 --> 23:40.020
You just go into the ting dashboard and just turn it off. That's awesome. Isn't that great? Yes

23:40.100 --> 23:42.980
And you just turn it back on and now the ting has cdma and gsm coverage

23:42.980 --> 23:44.100
You can roll over to either one

23:44.100 --> 23:47.860
Just make sure you get a device that's capable of doing that or just for the cost you get one on each

23:48.100 --> 23:49.620
Or if you just have a device already

23:49.620 --> 23:53.460
You can get a nine dollar gsm sim card from ting and enable that and it's good to go

23:53.860 --> 23:58.740
It's so straightforward. They also have a social presence, um, at least twitter and instagram

23:58.820 --> 24:01.700
I believe they're ting ftw on both and they're on youtube as well

24:01.780 --> 24:04.660
They have links at the top of their website and they're putting out great videos all the time

24:04.660 --> 24:09.220
They have a really active community at help.ting.com and on reddit. There's a ting subreddit

24:09.700 --> 24:10.820
That is always really good

24:10.820 --> 24:14.820
I visit that from time to time because i'm kind of a ting enthusiast so i'm always kind of checking out to see what's going

24:14.820 --> 24:19.540
On like, you know, hey, where's the how's the how's the edge being tested anyway firefox os devices on this kind of thing

24:19.860 --> 24:22.020
It's really nice. It's truly no bs mobile service

24:22.020 --> 24:27.300
they have a whole range of devices from like fifty dollar devices up to like the high end like nexus 6 and the moto x2 and

24:27.940 --> 24:32.260
You know the samsung devices all the really great devices over on ting and then you get that amazing dashboard

24:32.260 --> 24:37.700
If you go to linux.ting.com, that's linux.ting.com. You get to put linux in your your wall bar. That's pretty cool

24:37.700 --> 24:43.960
That's why I would go but then you also get a 25 discount and you support the linux unplugged show linux.ting.com

24:44.820 --> 24:48.180
Huge thanks to ting for sponsoring linux unplugged you guys rock

24:49.300 --> 24:53.060
Okay, angers, let's get real here about your switch to linux real quick

24:53.060 --> 24:57.380
And I wanted to kick it off with an email that we got him from kenny about your switch. Oh, I haven't heard this

24:57.460 --> 25:02.740
So i'm i'm ready to be beat up. No see ang, uh, you don't even probably fully understand

25:02.740 --> 25:07.780
But there's been quite a bit of controversy and debate on this show about your choice of arch over ubuntu

25:08.740 --> 25:14.100
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I you didn't really do they think I have a choice. Well, uh, see, uh

25:14.740 --> 25:16.820
Noah and I spent a lot of no. What okay

25:16.820 --> 25:20.580
Do you have like a 10 second recap you can give ang about how we almost went with ubuntu and then we went with arch?

25:21.220 --> 25:23.220
so essentially, um

25:23.220 --> 25:27.620
Based on the hardware that we're originally going to set you up with uh, it a long story short

25:27.620 --> 25:34.180
It ended up being more beneficial to go with arch due to some of the limitations of the installer of the alternative

25:34.820 --> 25:36.820
Distro and then once you got it

25:36.900 --> 25:39.300
We saw how excited you were and the chat room was

25:39.620 --> 25:43.460
More or less celebrating the fact that you were using quote-unquote real linux none of this

25:44.100 --> 25:46.740
Ubuntu stuff and then we saw your reaction to that

25:47.460 --> 25:52.500
When we went back to redo it due to some of the issues we ran into the second time around again

25:53.460 --> 25:56.180
with the the the alternate distros

25:56.180 --> 26:03.700
We again or I rather again opted to go with uh with antergos. Um, and one that kept everything uh,

26:04.500 --> 26:09.540
A similar experience to what you had on the original backbook that we gave you to what you had on the lenovo

26:09.940 --> 26:12.260
Um and the venoba she uses here in studio

26:12.900 --> 26:17.060
Right, but uh, then the other side of that was there was a lot of people and I would have been one of them

26:17.060 --> 26:20.740
Honestly, if i'm being honest about it a week before I got there somebody would have said

26:20.900 --> 26:25.380
Uh, we're gonna switch my wife to linux and she's never used linux before what we what should she use?

26:25.380 --> 26:29.780
The last answer that would have left my mouth was archer and or antergos

26:30.100 --> 26:34.900
And it wasn't until we actually got there and it's one of those things that if you weren't there in the studio

26:35.060 --> 26:38.180
Doing it with us, then you won't understand why we made that choice

26:39.300 --> 26:44.900
So, uh kenny writes in and he says in the past I would have kind of like wimpy did had suggested that you go with

26:44.960 --> 26:48.020
Ubuntu, uh or one of its many flavors for angela

26:48.020 --> 26:51.620
But now I might agree with your current decision to go with antergos gnome

26:51.620 --> 26:56.900
I had i've had my girlfriend's acer's laptop on antergos gnome for more than a year without issue

26:57.140 --> 26:58.740
As has been the same with my own laptop

26:58.740 --> 27:03.300
I did the initial setup which involved no more or minor hassle than you would expect from setting up linux on general hardware

27:03.460 --> 27:04.820
I don't monitor the updates

27:04.820 --> 27:08.580
She just pushes the button and when the notification comes in much the same as I do in fact now

27:08.820 --> 27:13.460
It just provides a nice easy option for updates. And if anything does go majorly wrong in the future

27:13.540 --> 27:17.620
Well, then i'll just boot off a usb stick transfer files off and reload if I can't fix it directly

27:17.620 --> 27:22.740
There's no difference to what I did when we were both on ubuntu plus being on the latest stable kernel has fixed far more

27:22.820 --> 27:24.740
Issues than it has introduced

27:24.740 --> 27:29.540
I can't think of any negatives actually at the moment because antergos is extremely finessed skin on arch

27:29.540 --> 27:35.700
It gives you a gorgeous gnome desktop right from the get-go. Whereas ubuntu gnome doesn't from the login screen through to the desktop

27:35.780 --> 27:37.540
It's just lovely

27:37.540 --> 27:39.780
Angela has already been impressed by that and I would

27:40.420 --> 27:46.820
I venture I would easily notice the difference between gnome 3 14 and 3 16 the whole notification things for start arch linux provides an engine

27:46.820 --> 27:51.300
But gnome antergos provides that polish and that beautifully veneered wheelhouse

27:51.380 --> 27:56.260
I think this is the future for ubuntu as well with an antergos like shock absorber over the raw power of linux

27:56.420 --> 27:59.300
I wouldn't have gone with elementary precisely because it's a mac-like interface

27:59.700 --> 28:02.340
It's like dressing a wolf up as sheath as a sheep

28:02.580 --> 28:05.220
It may look soft and cuddly but sooner or later it's going to bite you

28:05.620 --> 28:11.060
When something looks at when something looks the same you expect it to be the same and linux is definitely not os 10

28:11.300 --> 28:13.300
Thank you torvalds ii

28:13.460 --> 28:15.140
kenny

28:15.140 --> 28:17.940
So kenny thinks it was a good call for you to go with antergos anders

28:17.940 --> 28:22.340
And so you and I were kind of discussing a couple of issues that you ran into

28:22.820 --> 28:26.180
And you had some questions you wanted to bounce off the mumble room and see if they had some answers for you

28:26.180 --> 28:27.620
Do you kind of remember?

28:27.620 --> 28:31.380
Well, yeah, I forgot that I was going to be put on the spot. I should have um written them down

28:31.540 --> 28:34.820
Yes, because I was we were walking just before the show. Yeah, i'll write them down

28:34.820 --> 28:42.020
I was like here are the things that I so all right. So the first one was uh, there are constant updates. Yeah updates and

28:42.020 --> 28:48.580
Um, I feel inclined to you know, like it has a little pop-up and I I feel inclined to touch it

28:48.660 --> 28:50.660
Well because you know, it's a yoga 3 touch screen

28:50.820 --> 28:55.300
Um, I just don't even go near them because I have no idea what they're going to do or what needs to happen

28:55.460 --> 28:58.180
and as it turns out we did some updates and

28:59.060 --> 29:04.340
Uh, it did like the first part of a wi-fi update and it broke the wi-fi so it couldn't get the second update

29:04.500 --> 29:07.380
Yeah, it's just a broadcom wireless and then I was stuck at home

29:07.380 --> 29:12.420
Without being able to connect to the wi-fi. She had to wait for me to go home with my usb ethernet adapter

29:12.420 --> 29:16.900
So we could finish the updates. Yeah, that that's the that's the first bump you've run into. Yeah, really. Um,

29:17.460 --> 29:20.580
And uh, I don't know i'm on the fence on the updates. Yeah

29:21.140 --> 29:24.100
You see with linux and not see like with os 10 when you get an update

29:24.180 --> 29:27.140
It's updating like itunes or it'll update os 10 or safari, right?

29:27.300 --> 29:33.300
But with linux every single program gets updated from everybody. So all your apps constantly getting updated not just

29:33.300 --> 29:38.660
So it's not just os updates. It's like a new version of the editor a new version of libre office a new version of firefox

29:39.060 --> 29:42.100
So there's more reason to update too. Yeah, I do. Um,

29:43.620 --> 29:48.580
I somebody asked if I like the new mix theme or whatever, but that's when you changed

29:48.580 --> 29:49.780
Yeah, I changed it to evo pop

29:49.780 --> 29:55.620
Yeah, so we changed it because it was kind of hard like so I got I ordered using i'm using evo pop on my screen

29:55.620 --> 29:57.620
right here, so I ordered a mouse

29:57.780 --> 29:59.780
because

29:59.780 --> 30:06.500
Um, I needed a smaller one a more portable one because I take this, you know here and um, or anywhere really

30:07.060 --> 30:11.860
And I was able to find the settings to slow down the mouse cursor because oh my gosh

30:12.020 --> 30:14.020
Like it was flying off the screen

30:14.020 --> 30:20.660
But I couldn't tell that there was actually a circle to dial down the speed like I just guessed that there was and um,

30:21.060 --> 30:26.340
So we did change the theme and I like the new theme better. Yeah, but let's see what else um, I plugged in my iphone

30:26.340 --> 30:32.260
Oh, yeah. Okay. So hold on you're going too fast. Oh, i'm sorry. So let's stop right there. So constant updates mumble room

30:32.340 --> 30:33.620
Uh, what's the consensus?

30:33.620 --> 30:37.380
Do you guys think that we should just let angela go at it and update or do you think she should wait for me?

30:37.380 --> 30:39.380
To come in about once a week and install the updates

30:40.660 --> 30:43.300
Second thing really yeah, I wouldn't step right wait

30:44.420 --> 30:46.180
I wanted to say

30:46.180 --> 30:48.180
That yeah, it's have a more

30:48.640 --> 30:50.500
experienced user

30:50.500 --> 30:56.580
Guide her through the updates for a while once she gets the hang of it then hand her the ring. Yeah, I guess I could watch yeah

30:56.820 --> 30:58.100
That's what she said

30:58.100 --> 31:03.480
My vote would be that uh that she waits for you because oftentimes how often have you had that situation?

31:03.860 --> 31:07.380
Where you get the call from the user and they say, uh, my computer isn't working

31:07.380 --> 31:10.340
Well, what happened when it happened then they try to describe it to you and you ask them a very

31:11.220 --> 31:15.380
A very poignant question. Did you see an error that that resembled this or did this come up on the screen?

31:15.380 --> 31:20.420
I don't know a bunch of text scrolled across the screen. Oh, come on. Give me some credit here. I'm not saying that

31:20.500 --> 31:21.940
You're the person that's going to do that

31:21.940 --> 31:25.940
But i'm just saying if if if text comes up on the screen or or an error message is presented

31:25.940 --> 31:27.620
That doesn't make sense to you

31:27.620 --> 31:32.660
It might it's it's it's muscle memory when we see stuff that we've seen a million times before it

31:32.740 --> 31:34.900
It stands out to us and if that doesn't mean something to you

31:34.900 --> 31:39.540
It might something that would be very very important may not stand out. So i'm thinking that's a good idea

31:39.620 --> 31:42.180
Just disable update alerts. Well, no, I mean nice

31:42.180 --> 31:45.860
I well, I suppose we could do that. I was just thinking like every friday and I could just do them or something

31:46.020 --> 31:49.700
I could just sit there and after tech talk today. Yeah. Yeah, and then we so

31:51.140 --> 31:54.420
Sorry, so I have an alternative what about um

31:55.460 --> 31:57.140
having certain

31:57.140 --> 32:00.340
like giving angela a list of packages that like

32:01.140 --> 32:02.900
if she sees the

32:02.900 --> 32:08.820
Like linux then a broadenware then she doesn't need but everything else she can update

32:08.820 --> 32:15.860
It's yeah, I suppose we'd have to we just pride her at least like five packages that she cannot update and that's it

32:15.940 --> 32:18.980
I'm thinking maybe but i'm thinking that list would probably change

32:19.460 --> 32:24.660
Uh, yes, you can always put it the pacman hold, you know, don't update this package. Yeah, I suppose so

32:25.860 --> 32:28.660
Yeah, I think I I don't think I I don't think we need to go that far

32:28.660 --> 32:32.900
I think just waiting once a week and doing that if it breaks then we'll talk about it and we'll let people know

32:33.300 --> 32:35.460
Uh, all right. So there's answer number one now

32:35.460 --> 32:39.300
Here's number two and I don't know if we we may be able to get this cracked for you

32:39.540 --> 32:41.780
Maybe I don't know. We don't have a lot of iphone users in here

32:41.780 --> 32:44.340
But the number two problem that angela has run into

32:45.220 --> 32:46.820
angela go

32:46.820 --> 32:48.820
Is plugging in my iphone?

32:49.060 --> 32:51.380
Using the usb to lightning adapter

32:52.020 --> 32:57.780
It I I went ahead and plugged it in nothing automatically opened which was actually kind of refreshing to be honest

32:58.580 --> 33:02.260
Because you just hate it when stuff just pops up when you plug in your stuff because when I plug in my phone

33:02.260 --> 33:06.020
To a macbook it opens iphone and itunes. Yeah, this stuff just goes crazy

33:06.100 --> 33:10.900
And itunes automatically starts pulling in syncing and updating and I don't really prefer that

33:10.980 --> 33:12.660
I'd like to be able to tell it do it

33:12.660 --> 33:16.660
But what you're not you're not looking to sync music necessarily you're looking to pull your photos off

33:16.740 --> 33:20.180
Well, um, the camera is the number one thing, right? That's the biggest thing

33:20.260 --> 33:26.660
I do like I do like play counts because there is a degree of accuracy to play counts in

33:27.200 --> 33:30.340
Customizing playlists, but not super important anymore

33:30.340 --> 33:33.540
Um, yeah, so I opened. Um

33:35.220 --> 33:37.220
Shuttle shutter

33:37.460 --> 33:43.860
So lord shadow is saying if we install lib mobile device, it might support it. I wonder if oh, yeah lib

33:44.740 --> 33:49.620
Mobile device i'll take a look at that. I forgot the name of the photo program. Oh shot well shot well. Yes

33:49.860 --> 33:57.140
Yeah, so, um, I opened shot well and I was pleased to see that it showed a mobile device attached

33:57.140 --> 34:00.420
Um my iphone so I clicked on it and it said

34:01.060 --> 34:04.500
Importing pictures in the middle of the screen. Oh good. Yeah, well, no

34:05.140 --> 34:09.300
Well, the thing is I don't want it to automatically import. I don't want all my pictures up and you know

34:10.500 --> 34:12.020
Oh really? Hello?

34:12.020 --> 34:16.900
Because it also like at first I was like oh crap and then I saw on the bottom right hand corner where it said

34:18.100 --> 34:21.380
Import selected or import all you know, so i'm like, okay good

34:21.460 --> 34:25.700
So it's not going to automatically import even though it kind of looks like it's telling me that it's importing

34:25.700 --> 34:30.020
Yeah, um, it just stays there. I just left it there for a while. It never actually pulls them off

34:30.340 --> 34:33.140
It sees them, but it doesn't pull them off. It doesn't see them. It sees the device

34:33.460 --> 34:38.580
It doesn't preview any pictures and there's no like way to know if there's any pictures there

34:38.980 --> 34:43.060
Um, and those buttons aren't clickable, you know import all or import some

34:44.500 --> 34:46.100
so

34:46.100 --> 34:49.140
Yeah, okay, and uh lord shadow you say uh, yeah, here we go

34:49.140 --> 34:51.860
You got something the arch wiki on the eye and hooking up the ipod. Perfect

34:52.580 --> 34:54.580
Thank you. Awesome. So

34:54.580 --> 34:55.700
um

34:55.700 --> 34:57.700
one thing that I would like to um

34:58.100 --> 35:02.180
Say that I like is when I open up my laptop

35:04.180 --> 35:07.060
I don't know how to get it to the password screen

35:07.780 --> 35:09.140
other than to

35:09.140 --> 35:12.660
Use my finger and swipe the screen up. Yeah, you like that I do

35:13.220 --> 35:17.460
I do it's so nerdy, but and it's and it's out of uh, you know necessity because I don't know how to get it

35:18.020 --> 35:22.980
Oh, is that okay? Yeah, I think i've tried to skate before but it didn't work. Anyway, so um, so I really enjoy that

35:22.980 --> 35:28.340
Yeah, that is cool having the touch screen, huh? Yeah, i'm surprised you like that so much. Yeah now

35:28.340 --> 35:32.020
I know we had a third issue. I know there was a third item, but I just don't remember what it was

35:32.580 --> 35:34.180
Oh, I do remember what it was what?

35:34.180 --> 35:37.540
Um, and this is uh, this one may be one for knowing you to talk about

35:38.260 --> 35:46.180
The problem you had when you open up your bill spreadsheet. Oh, yeah. Yes. So, uh, this isn't libre office hate noah

35:46.180 --> 35:53.220
Brace yourself noah. I I have my dropbox set up and I was gonna just sync some files

35:53.380 --> 35:59.620
But it it's actually harder than I expected. Um, I open up my bill spreadsheet, which I go off of

36:01.060 --> 36:07.940
Like religiously religiously. Yeah, that's how you track everything. Yes, and with color codes and yeah, and first I got

36:08.500 --> 36:10.500
A couple errors and I don't know what they were

36:10.500 --> 36:12.500
Ha

36:14.020 --> 36:20.180
I said something like unnamed dot odt not found or something like that. Like it gave a file name. Okay

36:20.980 --> 36:26.420
Anyway, I got like three or four of those and then uh, it ended up opening up the spreadsheet, which is good

36:27.060 --> 36:29.060
But all the formatting was gone

36:30.900 --> 36:37.460
Now is this uh when you say that it says one file wasn't found it makes me wonder unnamed unnamed unnamed

36:37.460 --> 36:44.580
Dot odt do you have multiple was the spreadsheet is it connected to other spreadsheets by chance? No, I don't do that

36:45.300 --> 36:47.300
Okay, that is complicated

36:48.260 --> 36:50.980
So what when you say all the formatting is gone

36:51.060 --> 36:57.220
Are you talking about like text formatting or are you talking about like uh, like the formulas like the color coding shading? Yeah

36:57.300 --> 36:59.300
Yeah, okay. Yeah

36:59.380 --> 37:05.620
Um, I haven't uh, I haven't worked extensively with uh with with very very complicated spreadsheets

37:05.620 --> 37:09.780
but if you uh, if if there's a way to strip out the

37:10.340 --> 37:14.900
Uh anything that's anything that's sensitive data and if you could send me a copy of that spreadsheet

37:14.980 --> 37:15.700
I would you know

37:15.700 --> 37:17.860
If I could look at it i'd probably be able to tell you

37:18.420 --> 37:20.660
Why it's not working correctly or find out the answer for you

37:21.140 --> 37:26.740
Well, and I actually I have a solution to it and that is to use some kind of online in

37:27.140 --> 37:30.500
I was gonna say no, what do you think of like her using office 365 for this kind of thing?

37:30.500 --> 37:37.140
Um, yeah, actually office 365 is is as a as a linux user and as as somebody who supports

37:37.700 --> 37:39.700
You know free and open source software

37:39.780 --> 37:43.060
For me, I have to have an actual office week because that's just the way I prefer to work

37:43.060 --> 37:47.940
But I can sell three office 360 365, whatever they call it. Uh, no, no problem

37:48.260 --> 37:50.260
Because a it works flawlessly on linux

37:50.260 --> 37:55.620
It really does and two if you think about it the value there if you're paying 99 a year versus the whatever it was

37:55.620 --> 38:00.180
Three or four hundred dollars you would be upgrading your office, uh software every four years. Anyway, right?

38:00.180 --> 38:01.620
It's not free

38:01.620 --> 38:05.540
That's I don't think it's free. I think I think that there's a basic version that you can use for free

38:05.540 --> 38:07.540
But I think it's 99 bucks a year

38:07.620 --> 38:13.300
Well, I guess it's 10 bucks a month unless you pay I guess if it's for business bonsai. Joe says mint.com not mint linux

38:13.380 --> 38:19.780
Yeah, I I do use mint.com for jupyter broadcasting and our personal we i've been using it since uh, like

38:20.320 --> 38:24.260
2009 I think yeah, we've been using we're early adopters of that. Yeah

38:25.780 --> 38:26.820
Yeah

38:26.820 --> 38:31.620
Angela have you tried uploading that spreadsheet to google docs and see what it does with it. Um,

38:32.420 --> 38:34.420
No, they would read all of the things

38:35.460 --> 38:38.980
yeah, it is I mean it's my bill of spreadsheet, but the the thing is I

38:40.100 --> 38:45.700
I tried to use google docs as my thing, but it is so paired down and limited

38:46.420 --> 38:49.140
That it just I just hate it

38:49.220 --> 38:54.260
But I have started using it for like sponsor tracking and host payment tracking

38:54.260 --> 38:57.780
So I am dealing with it to a degree. It's just limited

38:58.180 --> 39:02.020
Yeah, I might be able to and and converting it like so that I could use it in excel

39:02.420 --> 39:07.860
It it made it a little complicated. But anyway, I was thinking that if I used, uh, you know

39:08.020 --> 39:12.660
Some sort of web-based program instead or or solution then I wouldn't have this I could go

39:12.980 --> 39:17.220
I could I could run ubuntu next week if I wanted to uh, look at this wimpy is just uh,

39:17.220 --> 39:21.620
Giving us the command i'm going to copy this right here. He just gave us the command to install mobile support in arch

39:21.620 --> 39:26.180
Yeah, yeah, so that should work pretty good. Well, then I should have an update for you guys next week then

39:26.660 --> 39:32.020
By chance have any of you tried caligra sheets the qt version of the spreadsheet program?

39:32.260 --> 39:38.020
No, the libre office version. No, no, I haven't the last mac user that we converted to linux

39:38.020 --> 39:43.140
He's um, I don't don't see him in the the room here now, but he actually switched from

39:43.620 --> 39:48.100
Uh from microsoft office over to caligre and said that it worked flawlessly for him

39:48.100 --> 39:52.340
And I know he does uh a lot of spreadsheet a lot of his work is spread

39:53.040 --> 39:55.940
Spreadsheet centric. Okay. Okay, cool. Yeah

39:55.940 --> 40:02.180
So the thing is like after I opened it, I was afraid of modifying it in any way because it's it's my live dropbox

40:02.260 --> 40:04.340
You know saved there. It's not like a copy

40:04.340 --> 40:08.020
I was afraid that if I modified anything and saved it that it would drop the formatting

40:08.500 --> 40:11.300
And if I open it elsewhere, it would it would not have it anymore

40:11.460 --> 40:15.620
And wimpy you have a suggestion maybe to help sort of bring some stability to the arch setup

40:15.620 --> 40:17.140
Okay

40:17.140 --> 40:19.140
Well, yeah, you were saying that um

40:19.300 --> 40:25.380
You've got a broadcom wi-fi device in that yoga three and it was whilst you were doing a kernel update that

40:25.940 --> 40:27.300
you lost

40:27.300 --> 40:29.300
wi-fi true, so

40:29.460 --> 40:36.020
I would suggest moving to the lts kernel in arch linux on angela's machine

40:36.420 --> 40:43.140
Okay, because that way you're not going to encounter as many kernel updates far far fewer in fact

40:43.140 --> 40:51.540
And therefore, you know, it's just the applications and and the utilities that are rolling then and I think there's far less

40:52.400 --> 40:54.920
opportunity for breakage in that configuration

40:56.260 --> 41:01.860
That's probably a good point. Uh, and and really there's really no it's probably no disadvantage with her machine

41:01.860 --> 41:05.620
I don't think her hardware requires like 318 or 40 or whatever it is, but

41:07.780 --> 41:10.660
Yeah, I guess it actually does make a good point on that if uh,

41:10.660 --> 41:16.580
She's on the lts kernel with the less updates. She might have an actual more stable machine because you have less updates

41:16.740 --> 41:18.100
Yeah, I like that

41:18.100 --> 41:20.180
That is pretty good idea wimpy. That's a nice little touch

41:20.180 --> 41:25.400
I'm going to write that down to a move over the latest lts kernel in arch is 3.14.41

41:26.420 --> 41:28.580
So it's not like ancient by any means

41:29.140 --> 41:35.620
Lts kernel. All right. I'm taking notes for you andrews. You like that? What what you also need to do is if you've got any drivers

41:35.620 --> 41:40.760
Kernel drivers you need to look for the uh dash lts suffix

41:41.300 --> 41:47.540
On the drivers you're using right? That is true. Yeah that binds the two together and then you're you're good. Yes, and they get updated together

41:50.420 --> 41:54.100
All right, so any other um greater or creator

41:54.180 --> 41:58.580
I don't know just pointed out that if I have it saved as dot xlsx that might be

41:59.540 --> 42:01.540
That might be making it buggy. Oh, yeah

42:01.540 --> 42:08.020
Oh, yeah, and save as xlsx yes. Yes. I don't almost forgot about that the xlsx and uh,

42:08.580 --> 42:10.580
Yeah, the excel. Yeah

42:10.980 --> 42:13.060
That whatever that file format actually is

42:13.540 --> 42:20.580
Doesn't work well in open in libreoffice if you have the older version file format saved then it'll work flawlessly

42:20.820 --> 42:27.780
It's the newer microsoft formats that's got some sort of proprietary garbage inside of the coding for the save files

42:28.820 --> 42:30.820
That corrupts it anything else? Yeah

42:30.820 --> 42:36.980
I uh, I think uh, I think that's good. So andres will you uh, give us an update in the future on uh, how it goes

42:36.980 --> 42:40.740
For you. Yeah, definitely. You keep us posted. Uh, and you know, let's talk about something else

42:40.740 --> 42:43.540
You've been using pretty heavily since your switch to linux wine

42:44.180 --> 42:46.180
uh

42:47.700 --> 42:49.700
No, unfortunately for you

42:49.700 --> 42:52.820
I actually just ordered a case because it disappeared from all the grocery stores

42:53.860 --> 43:00.100
I had to order a case online. That's 12 bottles chat room. Yes. She does drink chocolate wine

43:00.100 --> 43:04.660
It is very true choco vine chocolate wine choco vine. It is it is

43:05.220 --> 43:10.420
Creamy belgian chocolate with with some sort of trolley cheap red wine mixed in there. Yeah. Yeah, that's chocolate

43:10.660 --> 43:15.540
No, you've been using our new digital ocean droplet with our minecraft. Oh, yes, I have. Yeah, you have yeah

43:15.700 --> 43:15.860
Yeah

43:15.860 --> 43:19.860
Let's talk about digital ocean real quick before we shift gears here digital ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider

43:19.860 --> 43:23.860
Dedicated offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin up your own cloud server

43:23.860 --> 43:28.020
We've got a few of them now and one of them is a fairly beefy one running minecraft that angela and my son

43:28.020 --> 43:30.020
Are playing on all the time now? Yep

43:30.100 --> 43:30.820
It's really awesome

43:30.820 --> 43:34.740
And you know one of the things that's really great about digital ocean is it starts at only five dollars a month?

43:35.060 --> 43:36.820
And you can get started in 55 seconds

43:36.820 --> 43:39.780
So I knew for a really great price and really no time at all

43:39.860 --> 43:42.260
I could get my own droplet spun up and at five dollars

43:42.340 --> 43:46.980
You're gonna get 512 megabytes of ram a 20 gigabyte ssd one cpu and a terabyte of transfer

43:47.140 --> 43:50.580
I just knocked it up a couple so i'm paying like 20 bucks a month right now, I think or something

43:51.540 --> 43:55.380
And the reason why I went with my digital ocean droplet because I wanted I wanted like lots of transfer and lots of storage and

43:55.380 --> 44:00.820
Lots of ram and I was looking around like the hosted minecraft solutions and no downtime. Yeah, no down always running

44:00.980 --> 44:06.660
Yeah, and you know the hosted minecraft solutions that are dedicated for this are way more expensive way less control

44:06.740 --> 44:11.140
And I don't get this ssh in and get a command line and with digital ocean. I can take snapshots. I can manage it

44:11.140 --> 44:14.740
So if you guys want to meet want me to back something up before you make a big change we can do that

44:14.820 --> 44:16.020
It's really easy

44:16.020 --> 44:20.420
Uh, and you know, I think the other thing is is it we have a we have a international audience

44:20.580 --> 44:24.660
And a lot of you are in other parts of the world and digital ocean has data center locations in new york

44:24.660 --> 44:27.700
San francisco singapore amsterdam germany and london

44:27.940 --> 44:34.660
They have a really great brand new one in germany that has just incredible connectivity 40 gigabit e to each hypervisor their fastest ssds yet

44:34.980 --> 44:38.740
Uh, it's really though. Uh, it's a great service because for the value for the price

44:38.740 --> 44:40.260
You can get started in 55 seconds to get up there

44:40.260 --> 44:44.260
You can do anything you need to do you own this box you get root access. There's an html5 console

44:44.260 --> 44:48.180
It's based on linux using kvm as the virtualizer ssds throughout the entire stack

44:48.260 --> 44:53.540
So you get incredible disc io no longer need those fiber attached scuzzy rate arrays with the 10 000 rpm drives

44:53.540 --> 44:57.860
Those are gone and now you can create something locally on your own machine in a docker container and push it up to your own

44:57.860 --> 45:02.660
Droplet or set up a machine up there and digital ocean has an amazing interface to make it all possible

45:02.820 --> 45:06.100
It's super intuitive this control panel freaking rocks. It sets the bar

45:06.180 --> 45:07.060
Nobody else can touch it

45:07.060 --> 45:08.180
People are trying to rip it off

45:08.180 --> 45:10.900
But they can every time they try to do something digital ocean does it better?

45:11.060 --> 45:15.460
And a point to that they just rev their api the new version of their api came out that allows you to take

45:15.700 --> 45:20.100
Their straightforward dashboard and bring all that functionality on your own. You can take it with you

45:20.180 --> 45:23.220
You can write it into your applications. You can take advantage of the community written applications

45:23.220 --> 45:24.980
You can snap it into your management infrastructure

45:24.980 --> 45:28.260
You can just write a quick couple of lines of bash script or python or ruby code

45:28.500 --> 45:31.700
To do something like take a snapshot of your machine before you do a system update

45:31.860 --> 45:34.980
And then when you're on that digital ocean management where you get the html5 console

45:35.140 --> 45:38.500
You can do full dns management you get snapshots and you can do templates you get one-click

45:38.640 --> 45:44.100
Installations of things like docker and gitlab and ruby on rails all of this is linux technology open source stuff

45:44.180 --> 45:49.060
It's really awesome code and go check out ducu. It's one of the projects that contribute to make this possible

45:49.060 --> 45:54.660
They also work with upstream distributions like core os and and free bsd to make sure you get the best experience of those

45:54.740 --> 46:00.660
On digital ocean five dollars a month people when you use our promo code do unplugged do unplug

46:00.660 --> 46:04.100
That's all one word. It's lowercase. It's going to give you a ten dollar credit

46:04.260 --> 46:08.580
You can try out that five dollar rig two months for free go get your own linux box up in the cloud

46:08.740 --> 46:14.900
With crazy crazy fast access ssd drives. It's a real server that you get to control and it's super neat

46:14.900 --> 46:16.500
There's so many great things you can do with it

46:16.500 --> 46:23.300
I've got an own cloud rig a bit torrent sync rig a minecraft rig. I've got machines. We've used for production purposes

46:23.300 --> 46:27.860
We've got a droplet. We use to bounce video signals off a remote host like no during linux action show

46:28.100 --> 46:33.220
There's so many use cases for digital ocean that can be your back end infrastructure or just use them for hourly testing

46:33.540 --> 46:38.820
Digital ocean.com use the promo code do unplugged get a ten dollar credit do unplug just apply it to your account

46:38.820 --> 46:43.140
You can do it anytime. In fact, if you created your account you forgot to apply do unplug go use it

46:43.140 --> 46:48.180
Go apply it. You'll get that ten dollar credit do unplug over at digital ocean.com and a big

46:48.180 --> 46:52.260
Thanks to digital ocean for sponsoring the linux unplugged program. You guys are rockin

46:53.220 --> 46:55.940
Rockin and angel have been using that droplet like a fool

46:56.980 --> 46:58.820
Uh, so poppy didn't make it here today

46:58.820 --> 47:04.740
It doesn't look like uh, but heavens and I heavens revenge and I wanted to talk about uh this story

47:04.900 --> 47:08.020
Um, the ubuntu has developed, uh ubuntu snappy core

47:08.020 --> 47:11.540
We've talked about it before and it has in this last week taken up a ton of traction

47:11.540 --> 47:16.500
It's a brand new version of ubuntu. That's not even really fully baked and made it shipping on anything as far as I know

47:16.900 --> 47:18.020
but today

47:18.020 --> 47:22.280
Uh canonical and microsoft and ge and acer announced a partnership

47:22.980 --> 47:29.780
Uh where they're going to become allies and work on the internet of things devices including from ge standpoint a freaking fridge

47:29.860 --> 47:34.100
That runs ubuntu a freaking fridge a fridge that runs ubuntu a linux fridge

47:34.660 --> 47:40.500
And uh, they're all running off of ubuntu snappy core ubuntu snappy core is the transactionally updated version of ubuntu

47:40.500 --> 47:47.220
You install an update it installs that update to a new partition. Why are we shocked that a fridge is running linux?

47:47.860 --> 47:52.740
Like because it shouldn't be able to i'm like, why is that? Why is that like? Oh my gosh. Why does it need to?

47:53.860 --> 47:56.580
All right. My point is I think the other things is a bit of a joke, but okay

47:56.740 --> 48:01.700
But so i'm glad they're choosing a good distribution. I mean at least they're choosing linux and you know, so they're using this

48:02.180 --> 48:06.420
This transactionally updated version of ubuntu called ubuntu snappy and the way it works is you install an update

48:06.420 --> 48:10.580
It writes those updates to a new file system you reboot it boots into that new file system

48:10.820 --> 48:15.700
If it fails to boot it just boots into the old one. It's kind of like a guaranteed update system

48:15.940 --> 48:21.540
So that's ubuntu snappy core. That's how you update the system. Now. There's these new packages coming out called snaps

48:22.020 --> 48:27.700
They're a new version of click packages. We're taking click packages and we're calling them snaps. This is such a cute language

48:29.700 --> 48:34.340
It's very adorable and snaps and wow, but uh, uh, I I just I

48:34.340 --> 48:37.300
I look at this and i'm starting to get a little glazed over in heavens

48:37.300 --> 48:41.380
I know you wanted to mention uh that the snaps people might have a maybe a bad

48:41.840 --> 48:46.580
Interpretation of how snap packages work because I think people are assuming they're transactionally updated packages

48:46.580 --> 48:49.860
That means you'll never have a package that fails to install etc

48:50.100 --> 48:52.100
Do you want to jump in and sort of?

48:52.260 --> 48:57.300
You've been digging into this you've been looking specifically about how snappy core is architected. I know you have some observations here

48:58.340 --> 49:01.380
oh, yeah, i've been looking at this for quite a few days and

49:01.380 --> 49:07.880
And canonical is probably the worst source of information that you could have found in order to understand this system

49:08.440 --> 49:10.440
But they actually have

49:10.680 --> 49:17.480
Let's say one version of a piece of software. It's all static and installed under a version number

49:18.040 --> 49:20.840
directory in the file system then after that

49:21.720 --> 49:24.440
They just by when they mean transactional

49:24.440 --> 49:30.840
As the version numbers change in the directory structure. They change the symlink as a current

49:31.400 --> 49:35.320
To the different version number in the file system pretty simple when they mean transactional

49:35.400 --> 49:39.320
They just mean changing a symlink right to the other everything statically in there

49:39.560 --> 49:41.720
So this is a very bloated system

49:41.880 --> 49:43.640
Everything is within this package

49:43.640 --> 49:48.360
You mean everything like if the if a program requires a library instead of using the library that's already on the computer

49:48.440 --> 49:53.000
It pulls down that library with itself. It brings its own version of the library kind of like the pbi system does completely

49:53.000 --> 49:57.960
There's no reuse of system barely any reuse of system libraries

49:58.040 --> 50:03.000
They're all self-contained packages, which are statically compiled and possibly in it

50:04.440 --> 50:09.160
But what you're looking into snap packages themselves are not transactional like when I install an own cloud snap

50:09.400 --> 50:12.840
And then I want to go to own cloud 802. That's not a transactional update

50:13.960 --> 50:20.440
In the traditional sense of transactional no because there's stuff that can fail within a certain package

50:20.440 --> 50:23.560
It's to me transactional means all or nothing

50:23.800 --> 50:28.520
So even like a file can be can fail to be put onto the file system that

50:29.220 --> 50:31.740
Traditionally is not transactionally consistent

50:32.520 --> 50:38.360
Okay, but but where it is transactional and i'm not sure if this is implemented yet or if it's on the roadmaps

50:38.440 --> 50:46.220
But it was certainly presented if you take that own cloud example and you upgrade from own cloud 801 to own cloud 802

50:46.840 --> 50:48.840
And there's a sql schema change

50:48.840 --> 50:51.960
It will make that schema change on the database

50:52.680 --> 50:57.560
And update and then if you find a problem with that version and you roll it back to 801

50:58.200 --> 51:03.960
Those schema changes are undone and your and and your database what's tracking the schema changes?

51:04.040 --> 51:05.880
What rolls those schema changes back?

51:05.880 --> 51:11.720
I haven't looked into it in that much detail, but I know that this was the aspiration for what it can do

51:12.520 --> 51:16.840
they would have to be looking at the block changes on the system or at least copying everything like a

51:16.840 --> 51:22.760
Database completely separately between one version and the other or they have to the block level block level

51:23.400 --> 51:25.400
different like differential

51:25.400 --> 51:27.400
yeah, and maybe that'll be um

51:28.120 --> 51:32.600
Achieve and that would be only by what butter fs. Yeah, or overlay fs, right?

51:32.600 --> 51:35.080
But they're but their current implementation is using extended for

51:36.600 --> 51:38.600
Yeah, they require extended for at the moment

51:39.480 --> 51:43.960
I I spent some time talking to some of the devs about this and

51:43.960 --> 51:49.800
And it it whilst I learned a lot. It wasn't clear to me how much of what I was being told is

51:50.680 --> 51:58.120
What's available now versus where the aspirations are but I very much did get the impression that there's still

51:58.760 --> 52:05.960
Some work for canonical to do to flesh this out as a project and whilst they're encouraging people to get involved

52:06.680 --> 52:11.960
Um, I was asking well, you know, could I build one of the derivative flavors of ubuntu?

52:11.960 --> 52:15.480
Based on snappy right the same way. They're proposing to do for um

52:16.600 --> 52:21.640
Uh 1510 they're going to have a yeah their plan is to have a desktop image of unity next

52:22.120 --> 52:29.080
Using the snappy packaging and I was kind of encouraged to maybe not dive into it that deeply just now

52:29.560 --> 52:33.480
But to follow what was going on with ubuntu's developments with their desktop

52:34.280 --> 52:36.280
Um and certainly start look at packaging

52:36.280 --> 52:43.500
individual applications, but this is the other interesting thing about snappy what you consider a package traditionally

52:43.560 --> 52:47.400
And what is a snappy package could either be the same thing or very different

52:47.960 --> 52:55.000
so if you take um something like um, the mate desktop that's made up of lots of different components such of

52:55.400 --> 53:01.080
There's the mate session manager and the mate power manager and the kaja file manager and so on and so on

53:01.080 --> 53:07.720
Each of those are separate packages at the moment, but in the snappy landscape the mate desktop

53:08.200 --> 53:15.480
The whole thing could be a snappy package, right? So you could move the whole desktop environment between

53:16.280 --> 53:19.240
Major and minor version releases with a single package

53:20.200 --> 53:26.600
um, and this is a bit similar to what steam are doing right because steam provide effectively their

53:27.400 --> 53:29.400
Sandboxed runtime. Yeah

53:29.400 --> 53:32.360
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well each one of those snappy

53:32.920 --> 53:35.640
Sure, yaml files has dependencies that you can

53:36.280 --> 53:41.560
Note and then it would basically update the entire desktop even though you're updating all of them at the same time

53:42.520 --> 53:45.240
Yeah, and I think that that they were saying that they were going to do

53:46.040 --> 53:48.200
unity as a single or

53:49.080 --> 53:53.320
What will be unity at unity next as a single snappy package to start with?

53:53.320 --> 53:59.320
Hmm, so the whole desktop environment will be one package all of its libraries and everything

53:59.880 --> 54:05.640
Yeah, and then what they'll do is then start to tease that apart. So they'll start to pull bits apart from it

54:05.720 --> 54:11.400
So different bits that make up the unity desktop are delivered as different snaps

54:12.120 --> 54:12.440
Yeah

54:12.440 --> 54:14.840
so they're going to start with the whole thing because that's

54:15.080 --> 54:20.780
Relatively easy as far as I understood it and then start to tease it apart into sort of the sub components

54:20.780 --> 54:22.780
But I think they'll still be

54:23.260 --> 54:28.960
Bigger package, you know that there'll be um more like meta packages in a way, you know, but bigger runtimes

54:29.020 --> 54:32.940
I think they are very quickly about to leave people behind

54:33.420 --> 54:38.380
I'm seeing a lot of confusion about the software center still people don't understand how this fits in with that and

54:38.460 --> 54:41.580
They're not getting the message that the software center is kind of going away people

54:41.660 --> 54:47.660
I think they're starting to I think because so much is happening so fastly so fast, you know, it was uh, it's fastly

54:47.660 --> 54:52.300
Uh, you know, you have abuntu core snappy core then first you have abuntu core then you have snappy core

54:52.300 --> 54:57.500
Then you have click packages now you have snaps and it's all happening very fast and actually nothing's really shipped, right?

54:57.740 --> 55:03.180
But uh terms have changed things have been iterated and I think a lot of people out there are kind of getting left behind

55:03.260 --> 55:04.300
a little bit

55:04.300 --> 55:06.540
um, but I think not

55:07.180 --> 55:13.660
This all of this kind of seems like a very compelling interesting direction like they're truly doing something really unique here

55:13.660 --> 55:19.600
And yes snaps might be specific to abuntu. Um, and and there is some question about the snap back end being proprietary

55:19.820 --> 55:22.620
And the snap front end not and that's all kind of concerning

55:23.020 --> 55:25.020
but in some ways i'm kind of excited because

55:25.660 --> 55:30.380
It in a way like it could be a couple years down the road. You could have a system d powered snap installing

55:31.020 --> 55:35.100
Converging desktop that canonical shipping they could have they could have the most unique compelling

55:35.580 --> 55:39.900
Linux desktop out there in some respects if they pull all this off, let alone the internet of things crap

55:40.700 --> 55:42.700
Which i'm not excited about

55:42.700 --> 55:44.140
um

55:44.140 --> 55:49.020
I don't know. I don't know if it's proprietary. You think it's proprietary. I don't understand it. Yeah, go ahead rest

55:52.140 --> 55:55.100
No, okay, yes, what I don't understand is

55:56.300 --> 55:58.300
one this intro like

55:59.020 --> 56:01.020
dll hell like you have

56:01.580 --> 56:06.380
three different versions of the same library on the system because it's like an image is not

56:07.020 --> 56:10.700
Shared right there. Well, I mean the programs will be statically linked to their specific library

56:10.700 --> 56:13.980
So they're not going to get confused but there you're going to have a ton of them on the file system

56:14.140 --> 56:18.060
Yeah, but I feel like that's an old argument. I mean we all have huge hard drives

56:20.460 --> 56:25.500
This is how android does it at the moment so you know whether you know it or not if you need

56:26.140 --> 56:28.140
Shared libraries in your apks

56:29.100 --> 56:35.100
You don't just have the shared libraries that you need multiple times over but you have them for the different architectures as well. Yeah

56:36.220 --> 56:39.900
This is also a very simplified version of what bedrock is doing

56:39.900 --> 56:45.420
Yeah, yeah. Thank you for bringing that up. Right. Go ahead. This this this is actually like the issue of

56:46.140 --> 56:47.660
It's being it's a lot more packages

56:47.660 --> 56:47.980
Yes

56:47.980 --> 56:55.820
But those packages are usually tiny in comparison to how much we have as hard drives or just ssds now or gigantic for cheap now

56:56.460 --> 56:58.940
Um, it's it's not a big deal anymore. And

56:59.660 --> 57:04.220
Like if I have an extra 100 megs, ooh, whoop-de-doo. I have three terabytes

57:05.500 --> 57:08.380
Yeah, it did make more sense on the time of dial-up in every

57:08.380 --> 57:13.660
Every kill about you had to transfer mattered that I think yeah, so size doesn't really matter is what we're giving

57:16.140 --> 57:19.340
I think it is what we're saying size doesn't matter though. Well if it's a tiny package

57:19.580 --> 57:24.620
Yeah, it's my guess would be there be going to be around three times the size that we're used to now

57:26.300 --> 57:29.980
It's perfect, isn't it? It's great, huh? I'm on board. Yeah

57:30.540 --> 57:33.180
Uh, huh. I'm really curious to see where they go with this

57:33.180 --> 57:38.700
I don't I don't I don't I'm I don't know how they're gonna pull it off and transition but they got a lot of transitions

57:38.860 --> 57:44.700
Coming up. They got a lot to move people through there is a lot of terms in linux. Yeah, that's great, isn't it?

57:44.780 --> 57:45.660
No

57:45.660 --> 57:49.820
It's like every time I think i've got one down then another's thrown and i'm like, oh my god

57:49.900 --> 57:53.660
They create we create new we create like 100 new ones every week. I know right

57:56.540 --> 58:00.620
All right, so, you know, I want to talk about chip I want to talk about ubuntu rodent, okay

58:00.620 --> 58:03.020
We'll get that we'll do that. You could probably put that on the chip

58:03.500 --> 58:06.300
So I think this is going to be I think you're finally this is this is the device

58:06.620 --> 58:11.740
That's going to save our financial situation because at a nine dollar computer. You can't even you can't even balk at that

58:11.820 --> 58:16.940
That's that's something that's it's it's a it's a wearable right where you feed feed an animal you keep it alive

58:18.300 --> 58:20.300
I remember those those are the worst

58:20.620 --> 58:23.660
Uh, no, no not that before we get to that though. I want to tell you about something that's the best

58:23.660 --> 58:25.280
That's linux academy go over to linuxacademy.com

58:25.280 --> 58:30.960
Slash unplugged and get our special 33 unplugged discount. Oh, that's awesome. That is that is awesome. I know

58:32.320 --> 58:37.600
Linux academy.com slash unplugged linux academy freaking rocks. It's gonna help you take your skills set up to the next level

58:37.600 --> 58:41.120
So if you got like a review coming up or you want to land a client or you just want to feel better about yourself

58:41.120 --> 58:43.920
Maybe challenge yourself or learn all the words like I yeah

58:45.200 --> 58:50.560
Or another great one is because they have seven plus distributions you get to choose from uh, you can you can like migrate

58:50.560 --> 58:53.760
So like if you want to go from ubuntu to sento s or something like that

58:53.760 --> 59:00.000
You can go you choose from the seven plus distros all of the courseware automatically adjust the labs the virtual machines

59:00.160 --> 59:05.520
Automatically gets set to that distro. You've got self-paced courses with over 1400 videos that you can watch

59:05.680 --> 59:09.760
They've just rolled out a whole bunch of new stuff. I was just talking about this on coda radio yesterday angela

59:09.840 --> 59:11.680
But how much do you love this?

59:11.680 --> 59:16.880
Uh, just a couple of weeks ago linux academy rolled out a new feature called nuggets. Oh, this sounds good already

59:16.880 --> 59:22.320
It's like a tiny bits of of sparkly wisdom from experiences admin and devops just like one little bit of wisdom

59:22.320 --> 59:25.440
So it's not a whole course. It's cliff notes. Yeah, and like it's amazing

59:25.920 --> 59:27.840
Makes you do like one thing a lot better

59:27.840 --> 59:31.600
And so like here's an example of creating a pixi boot server for automated installs

59:31.840 --> 59:36.160
Setting up single sign-ons with actor directory and linux like that's a huge one for our audience

59:36.320 --> 59:40.480
Or what is actor directory like from a linux user's perspective and how do I make it work with my box?

59:40.720 --> 59:46.000
Like that's great. Here's ldap ubuntu 1504 and why we care configuring route 53 dns

59:46.320 --> 59:51.680
quick quickly deploying actor directory open file management foreground and nutshell system d versus system v init

59:51.680 --> 59:56.400
Setting up and using static routes look at all of these editing an iso image dos box encrypting a folder

59:56.640 --> 01:00:00.080
Changing linux kernel parameters securing ssh. It goes on and on

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:02.720
These are all just one little quick course where video courses you can go in there

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:06.560
And then of course as a linux academy subscriber you get access to all of the content

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.800
They just rolled out their new red hat certified system stuff

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:15.200
Yeah, like you can you you subscribe and it's just kind of like, um, you know netflix like a netflix subscription

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:20.560
But for education on linux stuff that makes you smarter. Yeah, and you can do your own pace like on the screen right now

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:25.680
Did you know that a little bit ago linux academy announced a um grant program?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.960
They're going to do a five thousand dollar open source grant program

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:35.040
For open source licensed projects people in the linux academy community are going to get to vote on which projects get the funding

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.320
Oh, how do you submit?

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.000
Uh, I they're gonna have a page up and i'll let people know but here's how you can vote

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.240
I know this so far because they're rolling this out in bit by bit

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.320
they've rolled out um a

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:48.320
A new club that you can be part of the founders club and in there's a bunch of perks like access to beta

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.880
Content and new stuff and new site development stuff

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:53.760
But also you get to vote on where the grant money goes towards

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.120
And you just have to be an open source licensed project to qualify for the grant

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.760
So there's probably a few projects in our audience that could get that money

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:02.720
Absolutely, and if you're going for your red hat certified system administration stuff

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:06.560
They've got courseware up on that and it has been a major hit on linux academy

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:10.800
The devops essentials course was just updated 50 video nuggets are now live

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:16.560
AWS csa pro courses available and a lot more content coming all the time over at linux academy. It's so awesome

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:21.200
Yeah, what I love about linux academy is they we've always got something new to talk about because they're constantly pushing out new stuff

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:28.160
And those guys just they just must be working 24 7 over there linux academy dot com slash unplugged get our linux unplugged discount

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:34.560
It's a great service built by linux and open source enthusiasts. So it really makes a difference. They're not a generic training site, right?

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:38.320
This is what they do. That's what makes them. So awesome linux academy.com

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:40.720
unplugged

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.200
Now it was actually I think it was poppy that or no

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:49.280
it wasn't poppy, but it was somebody in the mumble room that told me about chip chip is the world's first nine dollar computer and

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:55.440
It's it's already phenomenally successful on Kickstarter. So they don't need our attention. They've got 20,000 backers

01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:01.560
They had a goal of 50,000 24 days to go. Yeah, they had a goal of 50,000 and they've raised a million. Oh

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:12.760
Oh my gosh. Yes. So here I want to play chip for you. This is so cool. And of course, it's a linux based computer

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.240
This is chip the world's first nine dollar computer

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:21.160
Connect over a composite vga or hdmi

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:25.960
Chip does computer things save your documents to chip's onboard storage

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.520
surf the web over wi-fi

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.480
Play games with a bluetooth controller

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.960
But wait, there's more

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:42.360
This is pocket chip. It makes chip portable take chip put it into pocket chip and you can use chip anywhere. How cool is that?

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:47.960
Um, very you might have noticed chip looks a little different than every other computer

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:54.760
Because we built chip to fit into your projects and we're so excited to see what you can do with a nine dollar computer

01:02:54.760 --> 01:03:01.240
Kickstarter we need your help to make chip for nine dollars. We need to buy components in extremely large quantities

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:08.040
Help us make the nine dollar computer a reality and back chip on kickstarter today. Thanks

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:16.920
What do you think that's adorable the nine dollar computer well done and you can put it into your projects kind of looks like bimo

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:21.320
Does a little bit anybody in the mumble room been following chipper backed it even?

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:27.000
Any backers in there? I've been following it and I nearly backed it

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.280
Not now you haven't pulled the trigger, huh? How come?

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:37.400
Um, well the the shipping costs to the uk are more than twice the price of the device. Oh, yeah

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:41.180
The delivery estimate is september 2016

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.520
Oh, wow. Yeah, so they have some they're uh, january in may

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:50.920
Oh, you pay more to get it sooner. I don't know exactly i'm looking at that right now

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:55.000
Just it was just a bit far out. Yeah, you know, yeah

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:59.720
So gigahertz processor 512 megs of ram 4 gig of storage got wi-fi and bluetooth

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:07.000
Uh, I I really like the uh, the the thing that you kind of pooh poohed and let's see. Where is it? Oh, yeah

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:12.120
The game boy looking. Yeah, the pocket chip. Oh, it's like a pda or but look at this thing

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:17.240
Like so if this was a little computer for like dylan or abby like it's got a pencil hole so you can put a pencil in

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.760
It to hold it up, which is adorable. Come on. Oh my gosh, that is great

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:25.000
And it's got the gpio pins available so you can hook accessory devices up to it right there at the top

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:29.000
Um, I don't know. It's got a five-hour battery. I think it's a pretty neat idea

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:33.720
I I really want to play with one of these i'm not going to back it because I don't I don't have any use for it

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.520
But I am so thrilled that computers. Oh, i'm sure you do

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:41.880
I don't know. What do you think? I don't know. Hmm. It looks like it was pretty versatile. Yeah

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:45.640
I do have an idea that you can use it for if you were to get a few chip devices

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:51.480
You can use them as use one as an ldap server one uses a kerberos server one use as

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.120
a miniature file server

01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:01.400
Where's the bailiff cluster joke? Hold on. That's the bailiff cluster joke used to be right on tip of tongue for everybody

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:07.720
Ww this reminds you of the ouya. Do you think that means it's going to flop? I don't know, but like everybody thought that

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:12.840
Ouya was going to be like the best thing and it's gonna you know, we're gonna have you know

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:16.920
This portable gaming and then it just totally flopped. Yeah, we totally have one of those

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:20.520
So it's still in the box

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.840
It came out for like a day. Yeah, the ouya was a big flop. You're right

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.400
Well, the ouya was also

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:32.680
It was a floppy just in general when you know when I first saw it. I was like, okay an android console. I don't care

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.680
Yeah, the aim was wrong. Does anybody want our ouya thing?

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:40.200
Ouya. Ouya. It was wrong. They were off the mark with ouya. Yeah, this is different

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.720
This is this is more about something

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:45.560
This is a component almost to a larger build you buy this to build this into something else. I could see

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.480
Right, so there's a lot more opportunity. What does it do that arduino and pi doesn't?

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.280
Nine dollars. I don't know to be honest

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.320
Because yeah, what was the price?

01:05:55.320 --> 01:06:01.080
Because yeah, well use pi for nine dollars. So, you know, the pi is is quite a bit bigger

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:06.200
It's like yeah three times as big that's true. It is bigger and it it it looks like uh, you know

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.480
like things that you'd insert into a um

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:15.160
Like a teddy bear or something or no a tower. No, no the oh the pie. Oh, yeah. Yeah

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:19.320
Yeah, this looks like this looks like something you could insert into like another toy like this chip

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.080
Looks like you could put it in the inside a speaker

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:24.040
You could put it inside a teddy bear and make it do sounds like this is so small

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.800
It's it's as small as a vga cable. Basically. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.760
It could be a full linux system

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:34.120
Yeah, yeah. I yeah this whole area is pretty competitive

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:36.520
I don't think it's necessarily bad to have another competitor in this space though

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:41.960
And these guys kind of have a unique approach to it. I like that there arduino is also much more limited than this thing

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.440
This has a lot more already built into it

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:49.400
So it can do things by itself like it has it has uh, you know video out and everything like that

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:54.440
Everyone is not true. That's a great point. Yeah, that's a great point and they're working on you guessed it an app store

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:59.880
For this thing. Oh, geez, everything has apps. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wow

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.320
I do like the idea of the pocket chip. I think that's my favorite part

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:07.880
I'm with i'm with imacon like that's what really got me because like that's like okay now i'm starting to see it

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:12.040
I get it now. The pocket chip looks so cool probably because it looks like something I would have played with in the 80s

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:18.280
So we'll have a link to that in the show notes if you guys do want to back that

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:23.320
Um, it's like angela said they still got 24 days to go. So you got plenty of time to get in on it

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:25.720
Uh, they don't need your money. That's great

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:30.040
And now they're gonna be able to buy it massive quantities. I would think so china

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:37.640
Yeah, did they only ask for 50 000? Yeah. Yeah, and they got a million. So there you go and you know, uh,

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:42.840
Hey guys, when's the last time we saw a device like this that where they were pimping the fact that it runs windows

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:46.920
You guys remember anybody anybody hold on

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.920
The pie that calls for

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.480
Yeah

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:52.840
exactly

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.440
That's right. I mean nobody yeah

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:58.040
The raspberry pi 2 is going to eventually have some crappy stripped down version of windows whoop-de-doo

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:03.320
But nobody launches their premiere device on kickstarter like this and talk about how it runs windows or how it's going to run windows arm

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.320
Nobody does it. It's always linux

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:09.400
Always the pie also just said it could yeah true true

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.040
Yeah, I I said good for them

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:17.000
So it's by the next thing co and it's the chip and it's kickstarter.com and you just search for the chip on there

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.040
It's like super successful. So here I just want you to take this is the notes

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.840
All right, and i'll read those when I get home for the things we're going to do to your machine

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.840
Do you haven't do you feel like we covered everything for you today? I mean now you're gonna have another batch of stuff. Yeah

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:28.840
um

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:31.640
Do you have any final questions? Um, we just uh

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:34.440
Need to get my second monitor

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:40.120
Yeah, hooked up to that because it has a micro hdmi out. Yeah. Yeah. Do we need to get input on that or no?

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:43.960
I just have to get an adapter. It's no bigs. It's just uh, just got to get a micro hdmi adapter

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.040
Which we don't have one of course

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.600
All right. Well, then we will leave it right there. I uh, I should you know

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:54.520
I should probably mention before we go last week was matt's last episode of linux unplugged

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.600
He though is launching a whole new set of projects

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:01.800
He's like in a super creative phase phase right now over at matthartley.com to find out what he is up to

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.360
Angela though. Thank you for joining us and going through the rundown

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.120
I'd love to have you guys join us next week

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:11.080
We do this show live on tuesdays over jblive.tv 2 p.m pacific on a tuesday

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:17.000
but go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone and uh, then we will uh,

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.400
What you look at me like what?

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:22.200
Oh, and then now because we know we have the mumble room. We've got all that stuff

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:25.320
We'd love to have you guys in here. Uh, mumble room. Is there any other final notes?

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:27.320
You guys want to touch on before we run this week?

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:28.120
All right

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:31.340
So just a little bit of details before we get out of here go over to linuxactionshow.reddit.com

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:36.460
linuxactionshow.reddit.com that makes this show even better linuxactionshow.reddit.com is where you can submit stories

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:41.900
You can submit feedback. You can submit anything like that that you think would make this a better show feedback threads things like that

01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:45.420
Angela why don't you plug some of the stuff you're at people might want to follow you on the network

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:50.380
Okay, so I am doing women's tech radio and we are currently we've we've released two

01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:55.100
Linux fest northwest live interviews that we did the first was with scarlet

01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:59.900
She works for kde and kabuntu and she's uh, she's a linux for lifer

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:03.820
Yes, like and that's the title of the show. So check that one out. It's a it's a quick one

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:07.980
And then the most recent one actually, i'm sorry, it actually releases tomorrow. Yeah

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:11.900
Wednesday, yep episode 26 is andrea frost

01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:19.180
She was a firefighter in alaska and injured her leg and decided to go back to school and get a math degree

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:23.660
So she could teach math, but one of the prerequisites was to take a computer course

01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:26.380
And that changed her life

01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:30.220
Now she now has a master's in computer science check out the fo show

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:35.580
Apple watch versus android where I thought that was a pretty fun episode fo show fo show returned yesterday

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:37.900
And it's live after linux action show if you catch the linux action show

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:41.740
There you go. That'd be a good one to join us on because then you get to watch like linux action show on that show

01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:45.180
It's a whole lot of show. All right, everybody. Well, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of linux unplugged

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:56.780
We'll see you right back here next week

01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:10.140
It's good show andres thanks for being here didn't realize you had a time constraint there. Yeah. Well, we just have the music play

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:15.580
I know it's fine. Yeah, it's fine. So did you guys see the news about floss unplugged? I

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.940
Did a little bit. I just haven't gotten any links about it

01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:23.900
Uh, yeah, so we are working on a new show that will not be hosted by myself

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:29.360
Um, it'll be hosted by benjamin. Chris karencia. I think that's how you say his last name. Um karencia

01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:35.180
You may have seen him on our shows before we've interviewed him a couple of times. Uh, he uh,

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.340
is uh, uh

01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:43.260
Developer he speaks at a lot of conferences. He's an open source evangelist. Uh, he's a former firefox community release manager

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:47.660
I think he used to be an ubuntu member, uh, but is no longer and uh

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.300
I've bumped into him for a while and uh

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:56.460
And so he and I have been sort of talking back and forth about him creating a show with him and his co-host alex

01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:59.020
A show called floss unplugged which would be more

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:06.880
More focused on the free and libre aspects of open source and including firefox os devices and things like that. So it's still early
