1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
All of my thanks this saved the show today. Otherwise, we'd be still waiting to get started

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,000
We'd be later than we already are. No way. This is my best open source feature of the day g-edit

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,280
I didn't even realize this has this brilliant brilliant feature that allows you to

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,880
Cancel a huge huge file opening so I was on really I accidentally we're gonna play some clips from Brian control

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,080
We're gonna bust some myths and I accidentally spelled the dot MKV file dot MK

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,920
That's not the same thing. No. No, everybody knows that's the Mortal Kombat file. That's not what you want

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,040
So I double-clicked it and g-edit starts to open up because of course g-edit is my default editor for Mortal Kombat files

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,400
right up naturally and it

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,280
My whole system just kind of goes

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,800
What happens everything slows down g-edit sort of

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,040
What's happening and then a

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,800
A little blue window of hope slides down and it shows a loading bar

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,360
with a cancel button and

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,040
So yeah, I was able to click this and somehow not only did they manage to put in a cancel button?

15
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:15,420
But like they're properly threading the application. So it actually registered exactly. That's where that's where it's like. Yes, finally

16
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,280
Yeah, so it cancelled and boom my system came back immediately instead of opening up a multi megabyte

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,160
These are the things we want to be able to tell the Windows users and be like, this is why you need Linux

18
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,800
Yeah, it's almost like thank you G and thank you for being awesome in subtle ways that today was my favorite open source feature

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,560
This is Linux unplugged episode 167 for October 18th, 2016

20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
And 16

21
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:54,540
Well, welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's busting myths and fun this week

22
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,800
My name is Chris. My name is Wes L. Wes this show

23
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,520
I was I'll be honest with you if I was new to podcasting

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,240
I'd have butterflies in my tummy about how big the show is this week. You know what to do with yourself now though

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,240
I have my good friend alcohol those no kidding. Actually, it's just a really great show

26
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,680
And I can't wait for us to get into it. We have

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,920
Legitimately multiple breaking news stories at the top of the show that we'll get into so some great project updates

28
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,740
We've got a really great picture from the KDE project about their long-term vision for the plasma desktop

29
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,360
then

30
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,960
We're gonna actually get into some fascinating kernel discussion. Yeah, I know I know what that is a thing and it's gonna be

31
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,960
Really interesting because we'll segue into some recent criticism that Linux has been coming under

32
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,560
That sounds really reasonable and would probably make you think if you heard this story you probably think oh shit

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,520
What is Linux doing right? This is embarrassing

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:56,640
So we're gonna bust these myths in this week's episode then at the end of the show, we're gonna get real with you guys

35
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,340
Let's talk about the role of free software in a world. It just doesn't care people just don't care

36
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:09,260
Microsoft Apple they're doing good enough. These are the names people know let them control the computing platform

37
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,380
Why bother with it? It seems to be going fine. They know what they're doing corporate masters. Why should I care?

38
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,600
So we're gonna we're gonna talk about the role of free software in a world that at least for the most part seems to have

39
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:27,920
That opinion so before we get started. There's one order of business that we must attend to and that's welcoming in our virtual log

40
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
time appropriate greetings mumble room

41
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,880
It's like it's almost like music except for not at all like music because it's

42
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,120
No better than music. So let's start with are you guys ready for me to just should I just get right into all of like

43
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,760
The the quote-unquote breaking news, you know, I have to do it. I can't I can't stop myself

44
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,040
Oh, man, it feels good every time I have an excuse to play that I got to admit it

45
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,440
So let's start with the lighter of the breaking news and and we'll do a little follow-up and look into this some of the stuff

46
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,520
And I'm really jazzed about but we've got the first story is just sort of the lighter one

47
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,960
We have the name for Ubuntu 1704. It's gonna be dubbed

48
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,560
You know what it is with?

49
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,600
Zesty's a puss. Oh you do. Look at you. Yep, and it's gonna launch on April

50
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,120
2017 that's coming from looked at the zepus. It's it's actually pretty darn cute. Oh, is it?

51
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,360
I have the pictures I saw online made it look like a disgusting rat

52
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,720
Well, yeah, but it's more like a cute little mouse like creature. No, that's a squirrel. Mm-hmm. Oh, you're right

53
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,760
Yeah, well, I'm sure they'll go for the cuter one that's for sure so that is that's sort of the

54
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,960
Lighter of the breaking news. What do you think of that name?

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,280
It's probably pretty hard. You know what? I mean, there's a lot of choices. There's fun things like zebras

56
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,720
You have to that's the obvious choice, right? I mean everyone thinks you're gonna go for zebra

57
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,600
So they don't want to seem obvious. They've had a lot of kind of good interesting selections before

58
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,680
I think I actually think canonical has broke

59
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,160
Release naming to a point where I just don't care

60
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,000
Like when you you know

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,840
They got these crazy names and fedora tried to go their own crazy one with the meaty hot dog or whatever it was for a while

62
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,480
but this

63
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,340
This this shenanigans that's been going on now since the 1204 series or whatever

64
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,680
I mean for a little while like they made them sound like they were sturdy and sound but now they're just like it's just

65
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,200
An animal now, they're just cray-cray and I think marks just delighting and making us all say these words

66
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,760
I honestly believe that's what's happening. It's on now. I'm like, yeah, this is broken for me. Yes

67
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,480
I can't think we they have the nice little numbers that everyone uses anyway

68
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,880
So I always have to like double check me like which one cuz you know, it's like on the mirrors

69
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,960
It's always by the name. I'm like, yeah. Oh, yeah, absolutely, especially after it's been a couple of years

70
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,920
I just can't mama room. What do you think of the name? Anybody have thoughts on naming in general? Do you care at all?

71
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,080
Fair enough. Yeah, I don't I'm just gonna need something to put on the the numbers

72
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,440
What matters is the number for the version that really matters?

73
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,840
Okay, I wanted to give a give the room a moment

74
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:09,360
To do any addressing or criticisms of ours while we're on the Ubuntu topic of our review in

75
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,160
Episode 439 of the Linux action show that came out on Sunday. We reviewed Ubuntu 1610

76
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,920
Did you get a chance to see it? Yes, I did

77
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:23,000
Do you have any criticisms or follow-up or any thoughts about our review? You know, I'm interested honestly, I I

78
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,680
Think you guys are the ones reading the release notes and like kind of the the hype after the immediacy of the release

79
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,120
It really seems like they're coming coming hard on the cloud

80
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,320
Data center scale. Those are the things that I saw that stood out to me that I was excited for right?

81
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,880
I like Lexi. I like that kind of stuff

82
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,360
So I'm interested and I feel like the desktop I didn't hear as much about and I haven't tried it myself yet

83
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
So I'm kind of waiting to see

84
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,240
Both both both of your opinions are interesting, but I don't know where I fall yet

85
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Yeah, I think I think a lot of people in the audience are waiting anybody in the mum room by chance have 1610

86
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
I'm gonna bet no, but anybody have it installed

87
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,920
Yep, okay one guy

88
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,080
Excellent. All right. How are you? How's your experience been so far? Okay, two people. All right. Okay

89
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,960
First guy, how is your experience been so far?

90
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,160
It's been fine

91
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
Some things are broken, but nothing major

92
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,760
okay, well you say some things like

93
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,480
I had some problems with

94
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,920
The video monitors, but it's an Nvidia issue and I had it with 1604 and I had it before that with 1510

95
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
So this is like Linux release problems. Yeah

96
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Who's number two?

97
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,000
Thank you. I have mr. Mav. How's your experience been so far?

98
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:42,440
For the most part pretty smooth. I actually have it on my c720 and also have it on my desktop right now

99
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,440
well, I've actually switched back to event to from

100
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,360
art for a little bit for stability sake and just to

101
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,520
Just streamline my workflow chillin out for a better working. Well, I will say 4.8 and in a bunch user land

102
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,520
That's pretty sweet. Yeah. Yeah

103
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,600
4.8. Oh though, which will get more on in a minute. Let's let's go to our next breaking news story. I

104
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,120
Can't help myself. I'm sorry. I'm

105
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,200
Watched a lot of CNN. I've watched a lot of news recently for actually a few years

106
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,800
This story is probably the most news relevant. Although not the only breaking news story

107
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,240
But probably when we all care a lot about are you familiar with VeraCrypt that's the they forked TrueCrypt, right?

108
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,080
Right when the project current maintainer the old maintainer said I'm probably shouldn't use it anymore

109
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,280
Yeah

110
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,800
I'm out

111
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,040
VeraCrypt is a fork of TrueCrypt and one of the best things about VeraCrypt is it's able to mount your old TrueCrypt

112
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:43,240
Oh, right because they right. Yeah, that's kind of a big deal. So VeraCrypt has been undergoing an audit and today

113
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
As we record just a few hours ago

114
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,420
The public release of the results has landed and here's the quick and dirty about VeraCrypt

115
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,920
VeraCrypt 1.18 and its bootloaders were evaluated this release included a number of new features including non-western developed encryption options and a bootloader

116
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,320
That supports UEFI. Oh, thank goodness

117
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
I

118
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,960
Quick labs the people that did the audit found eight

119
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,320
critical vulnerabilities three medium vulnerabilities and 15 low or

120
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,800
informational

121
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,680
vulnerability concerns now within the security audit industry that that's like best practice stuff and

122
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
consider this or could lead to

123
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,400
So the public disclosure of these vulnerabilities consides with the release of their crypt

124
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,840
1.19 which fixes the vast majority of the high priority concerns

125
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,640
So if you are using VeraCrypt and you get on version 1.19, you're pretty much protected from all of this stuff

126
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,600
Hey, that's nice. Yeah, really nice. And I think I

127
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,160
Don't think we should let the that that detail pass by the responsiveness of the project to the audit, right?

128
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,840
That's either half of I benefit of absolutely

129
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:58,520
It shows a strong project with an intent to keep their end users protected and it's polling on the core strengths of open source

130
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,920
Those are three things behind a security product like this that matter a lot to me

131
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,480
So version 1.19 which fixes the vast majority of these high priority concerns is out

132
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,360
Some of these issues have not been fixed due to high complexity for the proposed fixes

133
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,240
but workarounds have been presented in documentation for VeraCrypt to review and

134
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,880
Here's another takeaway I have for you if you use the ghost cipher for encryption

135
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,000
Its implementation was fundamentally unsafe

136
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,360
And they're ripping it out

137
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,800
So they're gonna leave in the ability to decrypt it for now, but new volumes cannot be created with this cipher

138
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,840
So upgrade to VeraCrypt 1.19 and move your data to a new volume if you use the go cipher

139
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,240
you know be interested to see kind of the further reviews of this some like

140
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,840
Once one one point one nine is that what people see as they say it because you know

141
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,360
It's some of these I'm not a cryptographer. Some of this is like a you know to kind of interpret

142
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,920
It's a little disappointing to see that the ghost stuff as well as it's ghost not ghost. I'm not sure. Oh, no, you're right

143
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,920
There's no H. I'm just being a spaz

144
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,880
Thanks

145
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,800
it is nice to see a lot of the issues are you know a lot of things that are

146
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,960
Fixing here's like the a lot of issues pointed out are in the bootloader those ones

147
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm less concerned with so we'll see how how they continue to be responsive see how yeah

148
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,680
How much of the critical issues they fix?

149
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,980
We'll see that was my takeaway too is the bootloader was the source of a lot of the issues and that's not

150
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,860
Functionality I used from TrueCrypt and not functionality

151
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,660
I would use from Vericrypt and I don't know I don't know the long-term sustainability of this project

152
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,660
But it is nice to see active development. I do think

153
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,580
Cross-platform encryption is a worthy goal

154
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,740
Personally like Lux or other Linux based encryption tools meet my needs

155
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,620
So I'm I haven't used TrueCrypt or Vericrypt for many years

156
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,220
But it's a project or at least the idea of which I would support I did the same thing

157
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:52,300
I moved to Lux after the TrueCrypt tobacco. I just said right done with that going with the built-in solution and

158
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:57,580
honestly Lux on an external USB volume has worked remarkably well for me and

159
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
Lux has

160
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:06,080
Essentially become the default when you check encrypt my home folder on installers. You're almost always using Lux

161
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,540
So it's just kind of been the one I've I've landed on

162
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,820
Before we go on because this is some some pretty cool stuff

163
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,860
And if anybody has any thoughts on it, I don't I don't

164
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:22,620
Want to miss your input so since we have several new people in the mumble room aka the virtual lug today

165
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,420
I just want to let you guys know that if you want to get my attention

166
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,100
Just tag me in the chat room with mum

167
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,700
Mus so do like Chris ass Chris last mum colon and then what it is that you'd like to get in on the show and

168
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,440
I will try to I will call on you as we go along just that way

169
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,500
Keeps things organized yeah, yeah, so that's because I know we got actually good

170
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,420
We got good. We got a good mix of long-term errs and and newbies in there

171
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:52,760
So that's so could you know what good on the veracrit project for not only working with this audit, but again

172
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,260
Shipping one dot one nine, and this is how this works right the the auditors find issues

173
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:03,460
They work with the project on a on a like a gag order type basis to give them a certain amount of time typically to fix

174
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,460
up the problems

175
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,020
But if you watch tech snap you know that sometimes

176
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,860
This goes differently and the projects or the companies don't meet the deadline set by the auditors

177
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,860
And then the auditors go public

178
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
while the software isn't fixed and

179
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:25,380
It's it's a real catch-22 because it puts a lot of pressure on the developers to actually deliver a patch

180
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:34,460
But it also gives attackers a heads up to start going after end users that are unpatched and the fundamental issue here is

181
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:40,620
Even once you release an update. There's a massive lag time often for users to actually actually get all those updates

182
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:47,160
So that's still an issue even here. There's there are guaranteed way more people on veracrypt one dot

183
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,500
18 then there are now on one dot one nine

184
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,460
So there's a lot of users that are exposed so there's a window of time that attackers could take advantage of this

185
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,100
I will say looking at this at the PDF. They made as a report of this

186
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,900
It's pretty readable, so it might be something fun to check out even if you're not super interested in

187
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,220
Cryptography nice nice that'll be linked so if you go to the story in the show notes is that linked

188
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,340
Yeah, there it is right there at the bottom of the article

189
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,900
cool

190
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,500
Good stuff good stuff

191
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,780
And thanks to the veracrypt project for taking on true crypt because that felt like such a loss there for a little bit

192
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,700
It did so it was really cool all right Wes

193
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,340
I want to talk about something that's new and great from Linux Academy our first sponsor this week on the unplugged program go to

194
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:31,140
Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and take advantage of their new seven-day free trial

195
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,140
Now I've been a member of Linux Academy for a long time so I can tell you it's worth it

196
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,140
But this gives you a chance to try it out yourself

197
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:45,240
Kick it see what happens poke it. There's zero raw at it zero risk bang on it

198
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:51,380
See what Linux Academy is all about take a look at their courseware take a look at their feature set you'll experience something

199
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,060
I think is unique because Linux Academy itself is unique

200
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:59,260
They're built by people who are really passionate about Linux people who were developers educators

201
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,380
system administrators Linux enthusiasts

202
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,540
They came together and they created the Linux Academy platform

203
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,460
And I'm not making this up because I spoke to the owner of Linux Academy

204
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:14,100
I've been we've known each other for years now, but even before they became a sponsor. We had an email thread about

205
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:20,740
How he was how he watched JB about doing podcasts and things like that and it there's a great synergy

206
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,900
But it was it was one of these situations where I he and I kind of landed on this

207
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,660
On a conversation thread where we got very honest, and I said God

208
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,500
You know I maybe I should have thought about doing this because it's really brilliant

209
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:37,180
It's a great way to advocate and promote the Linux platform while delivering in a content driven way because all of this is with

210
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,660
Content they have labs and self-paced courses that you can go through they have core

211
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,100
Schedulers that work with how much time you have available

212
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,500
They have learning paths that give you content planned by instructors for specific career tracks

213
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,860
I think it's also a great business model just to show you know

214
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,020
It's like they're working a lot with all these open source tools and platforms and and yet

215
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,980
They're also providing a very good service that you know it's it's it's affordable. You'll get a lot out of it

216
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,860
I think it's clever to like that seven-day free trial think about how much you can learn in seven days

217
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,460
You're gonna get hooked and you're gonna want you're gonna want more and now they have external profiles, too

218
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:14,540
So if you want to just sort of prove to either your employer or a potential employer all of the courseware you've taken

219
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,780
They've got it. They've got external profiles

220
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,020
they have a great community stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members and

221
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,780
Check out their new quick starts about two hour courses with you get in there

222
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,600
It's like actually it's about two hours

223
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,140
And it can be up to like six or eight different courses that you take in that time

224
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,820
So it's a really great compact way to get a burst of information and knowledge right into your brain organ

225
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
Let's hang them linuxacademy.com

226
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,940
Slash unplug that's where you go to support this show and sign up

227
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,220
for a free

228
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,400
Seven-day trial. Thanks Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

229
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:56,020
Now I go to the virtual log to ask anybody in there anybody a plasma desktop user anybody running

230
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,980
Plasma 5 8 or a recent version. I know tomorrow is but he's not in there today

231
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:10,020
Nope he's our big KTE guy. He really you know he's a he represents. He does. He's he's there fierce running the neon

232
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:15,460
Mm-hmm yeah, yeah cutting edge, but we do have a little bit of a picture for those of you that might be interested perhaps

233
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,460
people listening at home

234
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:23,700
Might be a plasma desktop user well we have a little snapshot of what's coming up

235
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,920
They say their general direction point towards professional use cases, which is

236
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,480
Hey, that's just that's music to my ears. Well. He is I love that

237
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,760
We want a plasma to be a solid tool a reliable workhorse that gets out of the way

238
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,600
Allowing the user to get the job done quickly and elegantly

239
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
we want to be faster and

240
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,800
Better quality than the competition. I like all those things are great goals now

241
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,400
Here's how it's all going to break down our plan is to move from a four to three

242
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:01,680
From four to three yearly releases in 2017 and 2018 which we think strike a nice balance between our pace of development and the stabilization

243
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:07,640
Periods around that our discussion of the release schedule resulted in a following plan. I'm gonna. I'm gonna underscore here

244
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,760
This is probably all subject to change right well. Here's kind of what they're thinking

245
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,200
Plasma 5.9. The 31st the 31st of January 2017 so this is all 2017

246
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,040
Plasma 510 in May plasma 511 in September

247
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:29,840
So you kind of get an idea of the cadence there plasma 512 in December plasma 513 in July 2017

248
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:38,480
Plasma 513 in April 2018 plasma 514 LTS August of 2018 so that's our next LTS in August of 2018

249
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,600
So this is this is this is interesting

250
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,640
So they're going from four to three yearly releases and so you can see it stretching out

251
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,640
But what I think that means is sort of a stabilization of the landing spot for plasma desktop users

252
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
I think this is a really really good

253
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Kind of rough plan even if they can't nail it exactly and it's fascinating kind of being on the outside getting to look in

254
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,320
With this much transparency into like their inner working they say that they're gonna keep working on the breeze theme

255
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,840
They're gonna double down on this refinements and existing details

256
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,880
They're gonna work on icons across the whole UI and better theming for GTK

257
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,440
They have a feature backlog that they plan to get on including perhaps support for the global menu similar to the way unity or Mac

258
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,520
OS do it hey, what do you think of that? You know I don't use it myself, but

259
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,080
Kitty is already so customizable. I can see why you know if plasma had this feature as well

260
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,840
I think that'd be great also probably not a surprise to us. They're working more on Wayland

261
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,800
Kaywin brings them almost feature complete Wayland display server now

262
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,480
Which is remember how remember how you have to write your own Wayland display server Wow what a task for these desktop environments

263
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,280
Just to go from being a client to have to be the server which they say already works in most use cases

264
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,760
But hasn't seen a lot of real-world testing and lacks certain features that x11 users expect right now

265
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,200
Or ones they want to offer on modern hardware

266
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,560
so I like that too and of course they're gonna continue to work on plasma mobile, but

267
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,160
You know typically

268
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,480
We could easily say oh no another project is focusing on mobile

269
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,840
But um I actually feel like being three or four down on the list of things to do is just about the right spot

270
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,240
It's something you want to keep working on

271
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,280
It's something you don't want to lose too much ground on right

272
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,780
But it probably shouldn't be the primary focus of your project at least at this stage until something ships that makes it

273
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:25,960
That makes it make sense right yeah, so I think I again. I feel like they've got this online services. They plan

274
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,520
improvements and integration of online services and

275
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,720
Dependency handling for assets installed from the store

276
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:39,080
They have a developer recruitment outreach. They plan to double down on as well. Go help them out. I yeah, right yeah, I

277
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,800
Really think that this project is firing all cylinders right now. Don't it feel like it does it really does especially with that Wayland stuff

278
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,460
I'm excited to see that it feels like an I don't know maybe this time next year

279
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,800
We'll be talking about how great Katie. You know plasma is on Wayland. Well five eight is a solid release

280
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,740
I mean right I still have it no. I don't have it on any systems anymore. That's right

281
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,240
I had to I did I did a full full court install for a boon to 1610 and

282
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,680
That was that was a serious process um before we move on tech mav

283
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,600
I wanted to circle back you had more to say about the 1610

284
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,360
deployment go ahead

285
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,880
Tech Mav

286
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,360
Tech Mav

287
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,960
If you tagged me you should hello. No

288
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:28,640
Hmm our loss you know if I could do voices. I would just pretend to be one of the entire mumble room like

289
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,360
That is worth thinking. I won't say a thing yeah, there we go. Hello, Tech Mav. Control not shift

290
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,440
So yeah, you wanted if you wanted to loop back to the 1610 stuff well because we're about to talk a little more about

291
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,200
So this is sort of be a good spot to follow up. Oh

292
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,840
Oh, no, I was just you were having about I've got eight for Katie and I switched

293
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,560
I was on a five dot eight K plasma before I went to the 1610 of Ubuntu

294
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,200
Okay, oh, and what were your thoughts I?

295
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,440
Mean the plasma that was actually the best experience of plasma. I've had a long time. It's very smooth

296
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,320
And I like how they are really focusing on integrating breathe across the board yeah

297
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,480
That's they've done really good at that and also it was pretty cool to see the Android connect stuff built-in

298
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,600
Do you have you did you get to play with that at all? Yeah, very good. I did some yes

299
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:28,080
Yeah, that's and works great with my Motorola. Yeah, that is that is super nice

300
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,200
And it really feels like the future when you're getting there all right

301
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,400
Thank you, Tech Mav for the fall of now while we're talking about Ubuntu stuff. This is CNN breaking news. I can't I'm sorry

302
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,560
I'm sorry. It's okay. It's just I'm not saying anything

303
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,640
How many how many days how many times do we have like three or four really big stories break in the Linux world right?

304
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,920
And thank God. They're just not about politics

305
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,040
So this is when you hear about this at first you're gonna say oh well great red hats already doing this

306
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,760
Suits Enterprise already doing this what's the big news Ubuntu once again?

307
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,960
Doing their own thing remember actually all of that is wrong

308
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:08,440
But you're probably familiar with the concept of hot fixing or hot patching or live patching a running Linux kernel

309
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:14,240
Red Hat has their thing to do it Sousa has their thing to do it the kpatch and ksplice for respect

310
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,480
Respectively right there's that Oracle proprietary one yes, it's a big issue in the enterprise

311
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:26,640
Especially that up when you're running VMs or when you got a bunch of containers you got a host machine that maybe has 30

312
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,000
Containers on or even five containers you to update that running kernel and get it secure

313
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:36,560
You've got to restart all of those subsystems as well, and it's just it often just goes undone right

314
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,080
And then you're left vulnerable and so Red Hat

315
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,240
worked

316
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,600
Really hard on their solution for this they've really they've put they put a lot of time a lot of engineers

317
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,360
They're very very proud of it and very shortly after that Sousa also well. Hey we've been working on this

318
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,520
We're very proud of this and just just behind the scenes

319
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:03,120
all of these companies now have have reached out from their PR people to tell me all about it to tell me all of the

320
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,880
Different things to make sure that I know everything about it, so they're all very

321
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,560
Each each of these companies have been very yes

322
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,240
Very wanted to make sure they get the message out there, but I actually think canonical has the best

323
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,920
Implementation they might be the last of the party, but sometimes that's a good thing right and

324
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:27,800
This is something that you listening at home with your one computer or many computers can use so you don't need an enterprise plan

325
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:34,720
You don't have to be a reddit enterprise user or a Sousa enterprise user if you have a buntu on your laptop or your desktop

326
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,480
It just has to be 1604 on x86, and you can do this

327
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:45,920
So this is the ability to patch critical security vulnerabilities live in your kernel without rebooting and

328
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:51,020
This is what they're rolling out today. It's called the canonical live patch service

329
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Ubuntu 1604 LTS is a 4.4 kernel includes an important new security capability in

330
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,800
Ubuntu the ability to modify the running Linux kernel code think that's like the code in RAM

331
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,720
It's amazing without rebooting through a mechanism called kernel live patch

332
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:13,040
Today canonical has publicly launched the canonical live patch service and authenticated

333
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,920
encrypted

334
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:22,280
Signed stream of Linux live patches that apply to 64-bit Intel AMD architectures of the Ubuntu 1604

335
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,960
LTS release

336
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,280
Have to be running the kernel 4 4 generic

337
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,760
I think or something can't be running your own patch version

338
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:36,120
Addressing the highest and most critical security vulnerabilities without requiring a reboot one for it to take effect now again

339
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,800
Sousa and red hats are you okay? This is nothing new canonical is not the first to think of this

340
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:46,240
Why should I care they're doing a couple of things really interesting first of all crazy easy to set up

341
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,560
You do have to create an account on their thing, but it's really it's a it's it's a really interesting way

342
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,880
It is a it is a clever take on setting up something as complicated as kernel live patching

343
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,040
I'll just put it that way so I want to cover a couple of interesting things about it and a couple

344
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,920
Limitations the live patch service is available for generic and low latency flavors of the 64-bit kernel

345
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:12,160
Yeah, so you got to have x86 64 AMD 64 builds of Ubuntu 1604 LTS is kernel

346
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,920
Which is 4.4?

347
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:22,600
canonical live patches work on 1604 LTS servers and desktops on physical machines virtual machines and in the cloud the safety security and stability

348
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,320
Firmly depends on unmodified Ubuntu kernels and network access because you got to connect to the service

349
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,160
The ups this is why this is this is where they start to hint why I think they have the superior solution here

350
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,120
This is the first hint of it the upstream Linux live patch

351
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:44,140
Functionality upstream live patch functionality is currently limited to 64-bit x86 architecture at this time

352
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,360
However, IBM is working on support for power 8 and system 390 mainframe

353
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,360
Well, I guess they want that up to him and there's also active uptime development

354
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,760
Upstream, I'm sorry development on arm 64. Hey, that's cool. Yeah, that could be big

355
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:08,660
um, so that's where this is really different is this is an upstream thing that's already in kernel starting with kernel 4 4

356
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,320
every live patch by canonical is rigorously they say tested in

357
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,520
rigorously tested in canonicals in-house continuous integration continuous delivery system

358
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:25,240
They do a quality assurance which tests hundreds of combinations of live patch kernels hardware and physical machines and virtual machines

359
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:32,160
Well again, you are pushing out updates directly to people's kernels. So this has got to be that pretty seriously

360
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,400
This is a whole nother level. They aren't willing to reboot. So they are taking this pretty serious, right?

361
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:42,640
I mean if they're gonna trust your patches and and how how they do a little additional testing is interesting and I'm gonna get to that

362
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,440
But let me just tell you about this the canonical live patch service is intended to address the high and critical severity Linux kernel

363
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,440
Security vulnerabilities as identified by the Ubuntu security notices and the CVE databases

364
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,960
We if you watch text now, we talk about this stuff all the time

365
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,320
And so there's a certain level of CVE vulnerabilities and when they reach that they'll do live patches

366
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,800
There are some limitations to the kernels live patching technology

367
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,700
Some Linux kernel code paths cannot be safely patched while running

368
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,960
They say they'll do their best to supply canonical live patches for high and critical vulnerabilities in a timely fashion

369
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:22,280
Whenever possible there may be occasions when traditional kernel upgrades and reboots might still be necessary and they will communicate that through notifications

370
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,080
so

371
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,720
One question. Yes, do they have a catchy song advertising this service?

372
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,660
Because I don't I mean, I don't know if I can I don't know if I can deal if they don't they it's funny because

373
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,400
When they get to the comparison, that's one of the okay, I'll get there you're I'll get there

374
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,000
But this is the this is the details. I think that applies most to people listening that aren't in the enterprise

375
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,600
So if you're a home user or a small business, this is the stuff here. You're gonna care about

376
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,040
you do need a subscription possibly and

377
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:59,440
You definitely need an account the canonical live patch service provides a secure encrypted authenticated connection, which um

378
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,880
Seems pretty necessary when you're live patching your kernel. Yeah, I'll just take any old bit stream. That's fine

379
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,080
Throw it in the rain. Connect over HTTP. We're good

380
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:15,400
To ensure that only properly signed live patch kernel modules and most importantly the right modules are delivered directly to your system with extreme quality and high testing

381
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,600
They do have a subscription service if you have a lot of systems, but

382
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,320
Canonical is providing the live patch service

383
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,720
To community users of Ubuntu at no charge

384
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:33,400
For up to three machines desktop servers virtual machines in cloud instances. Well, damn I got way more droplets in that

385
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,040
Yes, but if you got up to three machines you can play with this live patch your house or that's your three critical servers

386
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,840
No, maybe my three my three droplets. I never want to reboot but I want to keep them secure that actually

387
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,600
Might work. The other thing is maybe you do it all, you know, you're using their fancy little XT thing

388
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,000
You get three big container droplets and I run containers on those. Oh, man. Yeah

389
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,640
And here's the other thing that I think is fascinating about the free mechanism

390
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:02,520
Because this is also how canonical is sussing out if these patches are gonna blow your system up and this is I mean

391
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:10,200
You interpret as you want, but they say a randomly chosen subset of the free users of canonicals live patch

392
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:17,240
Will receive their canonical live patches slightly earlier than the rest of the free users or the subscription users

393
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,640
as a lightweight

394
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Canary testing mechanism

395
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,800
Benefiting benefiting all canonical live patch users

396
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:33,000
So the free users some of them will randomly get selected to occasionally receive the updates before the other users

397
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,200
That's gonna be you every time, you know what, you know what Chris that's you every time

398
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,760
Ah, you know to be fair. This is pretty common. This is how Microsoft rollouts

399
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,440
major

400
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:48,600
Winders updates once uh, once they get enough data back to the canary live patches apply safely all canonical live patch users

401
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,840
Receive their updates

402
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,600
So that's do your part. Yeah, I guess a preloader. Yeah

403
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,560
Okay, and then of course the big question what about the source what about the source the source code of live patch modules

404
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:07,960
Is found here and we have it linked in the show notes that got that all published. The source of the canonical live patch client

405
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,160
is part of canonicals landscape system management product and is

406
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,640
commercial software

407
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:20,200
I see now does the inner I don't think anyone in the enterprise gives one shit about that

408
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,960
They have enterprise agreements to protect them referred to our topic later in the show about that

409
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,480
Now the question is

410
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:35,240
How does this compare to the stuff that oracle's doing to the stuff red hats doing to the stuff seuss is doing?

411
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,560
The concepts are largely the same

412
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:44,600
But the technical implementations and commercial terms are very different oracle's ksplice uses its own technology. It's not upstream, right?

413
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,620
Reddit enterprise linux and seuss currently use their own homegrown kpatch and kgraph implementations retrospectively

414
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:56,280
Canonicals live patching uses the upstream linux kernel live patching technology. That's awesome

415
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:03,560
ksplice is free, but unsupported for ubuntu desktops and only available for oracle linux and red hat enterprise linux servers with

416
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,480
An oracle linux premiere support license, which is 2300 a year a node

417
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,720
Of course it is

418
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,920
2300 a node. It's a little unclear how to subscribe to the red hat enterprise kernel live patching

419
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:22,760
But it appears that you need to first be a red hat enterprise linux customer and then enroll in their special interest group through your

420
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:29,080
Technical account manager, which you have to have one and which requires red enterprise linux server premium subscription

421
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,400
Which is thirteen hundred dollars a node a year

422
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,640
Wow, and then the seuss live patching is available as an add-on

423
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,840
But to seuss linux enterprise server 12

424
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,600
We have to get a priority priority support subscription at

425
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
1500 dollars a node a year

426
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,400
But you do get that free music video. Hey, yeah, so that's got to be worth something

427
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,760
I mean, you're you're obviously relevant if you've got a music video. That's I mean look everybody they're relevant

428
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,920
Uh, then canonical they still owe a lot of money to those the people that made that video

429
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,360
That's where the subscription price comes from. So when you yeah, I gotta pay that out

430
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,080
So, uh when you do decide if you decide to subscribe to the canonical live patch

431
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:12,600
If you got more than three systems, you're paying 150 a node per year. Well, okay. Well, that's that's more reasonable

432
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Yeah, and presumably you have to care about these nodes enough that you can get a free subscription

433
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,680
Yeah, and presumably you have to care about these nodes enough that you want a live patch, right?

434
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,160
So if you have six systems, you could probably go make two accounts

435
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
I'm not saying but you're just saying

436
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,720
Yeah

437
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,720
So this

438
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,920
Seems to be

439
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,200
a pretty

440
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,960
Huge release from canonical even though a lot of people will dismiss it as

441
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,200
Ah, that's that's been done before but I don't think it's been done like this

442
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,720
I really think what they did is they waited for the upstream code to just have it

443
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,480
Did right they didn't want to they didn't want to invent their own system. Yeah

444
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:54,760
And which probably means that uh, you know anybody that's running 4.4 could probably invent their own

445
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,080
method of doing this but

446
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,680
I think this is a pretty competitive. I also think it's a you know, it's like it's not

447
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,960
At least while it's competitive see how it used but I can definitely see in the future it getting thrown over the open source fence

448
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,160
And then here's the other thing that I think it shows

449
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:15,720
It shows why ubuntu is so much more popular on the cloud type vps instances

450
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,760
Than susa or red hat enterprise linux, which you think about it

451
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:24,760
It's almost a joke to suggest that you go buy a vps and run susa or red hat enterprise. Maybe centos for sure

452
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:32,440
Yeah, totally, but susa enterprise linux or red hat enterprise linux, which are built for servers designed to run on 24 7 workloads

453
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,240
It's a joke to think you go get a vps with one of those on there

454
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,400
and you can find them but it like nobody does it no and and

455
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,080
Why is that if you look at those prices that we just talked about?

456
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:48,440
It's a if you if you decide to go with this on your production vps with ubuntu on there

457
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,200
You likely did not a pay for the version of ubuntu that's on there and b

458
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,360
You may not even have a support subscription and c if you decide to get this live patching

459
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:02,440
It's 150 bucks versus 1500 bucks or 1300 bucks. I mean really so, uh

460
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:09,480
Uh red hat would you'd have to get the you have to get the 2300 subscription from oracle and the and the 1300

461
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:15,240
Subscription from red hat and with susa you have to get the 1500 subscription and only works on linux enterprise server 12

462
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,520
geez

463
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,960
And my

464
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:26,360
Who knows but my gut tells me that likely the next lts will also support this so they'll do this for every lts

465
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,160
And now you look at a system here that's sitting in production. I start thinking to myself. Why I wouldn't mind that

466
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,160
I don't like rebooting these ever. Mm-hmm

467
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,440
And 150 bucks. That's really not that much especially if it's only a couple and hey you get three free. Yeah

468
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,480
Pretty neat anybody in the mumble room want to jump in before we move on

469
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:49,320
I think does that wrap up our breaking? I think it's all the breaking news breaking news. Yeah, so that's

470
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:57,000
That is it. Oh, actually, no, it's not there is one more and I won't do the soundboard because i've been obnoxious with it

471
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,520
Um scraper you have a you have a uh, let's see scrappy paw. I'm not even sure what scrap job

472
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,240
Scrap job you have a comment about reboots. Go ahead

473
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,320
Yeah, you guys being in a studio that you only broadcast from you know once

474
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:19,480
Uh, you know a day. I know you have live things that are running throughout 24 7, but wouldn't you shut down unused machines?

475
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,760
You know you would think um

476
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
the big issue is

477
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,400
With hdmi video capture and god, I can't wait till we move away from hdmi

478
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:35,000
There is a display port everywhere. I hope there is a there is like a

479
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,720
sequence you have to go through for your capture and your output to see each other and

480
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,920
It has to be timed just right and when you have multiple systems. So we have we have

481
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,320
Three doing hdmi in and like we have like four or five hdmi outs

482
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:57,640
five hdmi outs and they're just they're just a catastrophe to work with and so we generally what we do is we run the systems in

483
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,720
Like a a low power mode where the display is still sending a signal

484
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,640
But like the screens are off the hard drives are spun down or something like that

485
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,680
but we leave them running 24 7 just because

486
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,640
um

487
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,600
The the schedule of doing daily productions and sometimes two shows a day is tight enough

488
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,880
There's not quite enough room for troubleshooting that because sometimes troubleshooting that can take like 45 minutes to an hour

489
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,560
And there are a lot of times where you're showing up here and then 10 minutes and you need to be on the air

490
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,920
Every now and then that yeah that that does that does tend to happen from time to time most time

491
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,720
I'm here before a show, but there have definitely been times where uh

492
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,480
there was one time for tech talk today where uh

493
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,760
Thank god for rikai because he's a miracle worker

494
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,120
I I don't know. I don't know how he knew I wasn't just not coming in

495
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:47,080
But somehow his beard spider sense was tingling and he knew that I was on the road

496
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,760
But was not going to make it on time and I I legitimately don't know how he knew

497
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,440
But he knew because it could have been I I guess because I don't ever just not show up

498
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,080
I guess that's how he knew I guess he knew because I know I always make it

499
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,840
And so he's like but he must have looked at the clock and said there's no way he's gonna get

500
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:06,280
So he came down in the studio and got stuff going and I literally walked in the door and sat down and started the show

501
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,080
And that was like the tightest it had ever been and it is wow

502
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,680
And if there's any outage right there, I spend the first half hour of the show

503
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:18,840
Troubleshooting that and then i'm all you're grumpy. I am wrecked. I'm wrecked by the end of that. I'm wrecked

504
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,160
So yeah, and you don't want to start a show all wrecked. No

505
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,640
Okay, so we do have one more break. Yeah, okay. This is cnn breaking news

506
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,560
This is something I think i'll be using in the near near future me too

507
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:36,760
This is really cool. It's a new tool that lets you easily install ubuntu touch os on your mobile device

508
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,100
It's a tool developed by marius

509
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,600
Quebec marius marius. What do you think on that last name?

510
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,440
Quebec yeah, I don't know. Yeah, okay, and it's called the magic dash device dash tool

511
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:56,680
Magic device tool the first stable version magic device dash tool 1.0 is now available to everyone and promises

512
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,040
an

513
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:04,040
Very simple and easy to use batch tool for installing canonicals ubuntu touch as well as android

514
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:09,420
Cyanogen mod or phoenix os so it's not just an ubuntu touch tool

515
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,060
You'll be able to replace your mobile operating system on your device with any of the following. Cyanogen. Okay

516
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,700
I just said all that. I don't know why they repeat that. Oh, oh, oh, there is one caveat

517
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,020
I wanted to know about though. They don't support the versions of images that have the google apps

518
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,780
Okay

519
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:27,180
So here's the devices though. This is what matters the bq queries e 4.5

520
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:34,700
The bq queries e5 hd bq queries m10 bq queries m10 fhd etc. So the us mx pro mu is pro 5

521
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:39,740
Now we're starting to cook with gas though. The nexus 4 the nexus 5

522
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,660
nexus 7

523
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:49,540
2013 Wi-Fi the nexus 7 2013 LTE the nexus 7 2012 3g the nexus 10 the one plus and the fair phone

524
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,820
To may not work

525
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,020
You don't think so. Well, that's what that says. Oh does it just at the bottom there?

526
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,780
Oh the fair point to you

527
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:05,500
That's okay. I don't think that's probably no, it's not a nexus 5 though. That's a big deal. Also the nexus 7

528
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,420
I've always wanted to do it on that

529
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:12,260
But I just don't have the time and this thing and also it can do backups here of your machine. It can do

530
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:20,060
Restorations it can unlock or lock the bootloader and it also supports installing the TW RP recovery image

531
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:26,980
This is amazing. Yep, you know, I've seen some similar tools for Windows that I think it's a it's a nice new

532
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,180
niche for people where it's like well, maybe you flash your phone or need to do this like

533
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:36,540
Once maybe a year and so if you're not like ready to jump down in the ADB shell or any of that

534
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:40,200
Here's a handy tool that you can use to do that or honestly for me

535
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,980
It's it's not that I haven't used ADB

536
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,160
But I haven't used ADB in so long that I would I would spend enough time

537
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,860
Googling around and reading XDA forms that I just don't want to spend that time

538
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,740
This thing already knows how to do it. That's what I really want is the end result. I don't I don't really care

539
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:00,420
You're not developing for Android. You're not making it. Yeah. Yeah, I'm that guy. I'm that guy

540
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,820
I I admit it when it comes to this kind of stuff

541
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:07,380
I'm that guy, but I think this is a super positive development and it's a tool all the I think

542
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,180
My pixel gets here. I'll be using this and that's trying out a bunch of

543
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,500
Did I did which one?

544
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:20,100
I got the smaller one. Oh, yeah, good call. I mean it just seemed I don't have huge hands

545
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,820
It's all about you keep it in your pocket. Do you keep it? That's what it's about

546
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:27,140
I got a 4.7 inch phone now and I'm all about that. It's in my pocket right now

547
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,940
I didn't even know I had to feel I had to touch my pocket comfortable

548
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,860
I've literally been sitting here for how long I didn't even know that phones in my pocket. That's what I'm talking about

549
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:39,980
See the 6p. It's a brick dude. Totally. So that's interesting. Did you get the 128? I did I did

550
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,980
I'm I don't know if I'll need it or not

551
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:46,120
But so we plan to have the phone for when it wouldn't they say when did you say you're getting it?

552
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,960
Because I went for the 128. I don't get it till like mid-november

553
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:55,200
So a month or so, that's rough. Yeah, it's rough mid-november, huh?

554
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,880
Geez, yeah

555
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:03,040
There have you read me the reviews that came out today? Yeah, that's positive. They're positive. Yeah, I

556
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,720
Think I think it's the Android phone to get right now if you're gonna get an Android phone. Mm-hmm, and

557
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,600
And I need a new phone and yeah, you do it

558
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:20,000
It's nice enough. Not only do you have a Nexus 5 but you your phone is busted the app. It is bad

559
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,600
Well, I've been waiting for this scratch yourself with that. Yeah, thankfully now

560
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:30,040
But it is dangerous. It is definitely dangerous. That's probably may explode. It's made by LG, but it may explode

561
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,680
You also are constantly charging that thing of notice. That's true

562
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:39,360
And that's one of the things that come back on the early news is by the way user air 7 just came out where we gave

563
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,000
You our full take on the pixel if you are interested as well as the app

564
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,520
Absolute very best way to get great audio on Linux

565
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:54,360
We talked about that and a few other tidbits that I think are actually I think it was a really good episode of user

566
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:59,120
I decided to listen to it user air 7 is out where we do talk about the pixel so I cannot wait to try it out

567
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,080
I'm kind of on the fence myself. I think I'm gonna let things go for a while

568
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:08,200
I'm good when you're in a position, you know, if you have a good phone that you like, it's not necessarily worthwhile

569
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:15,560
Also, I am I am personally until I am proven. Otherwise, I am an avid believer in optical image stabilization

570
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:22,920
I know that they have incredible post-processing but physically having a lens that floats I think is unbeatable

571
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,480
And so when pictures are a big part of it

572
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,880
I know it's got a great camera and a great sensor and so they say and the reviews do seem to back that up

573
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,000
But it does lack actual optical image stabilization that to me in 2016 nearly

574
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,880
2017 it's gonna be your phone in 2017. That's a bit of a yeah, that's a bit of a

575
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,040
Bummer, I guess we'll see we can do some photo shoots here in the studio

576
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,360
Yeah, I mean so far the reviews have been pretty good and loved and the video they say it really is impressive

577
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,840
So yeah, you know what? Why don't we take a moment?

578
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,600
And why don't we thank our sponsor ting go over to ting dot actually, you know what?

579
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,640
I can't believe it. I almost just I almost well

580
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:07,120
I almost forgot to say you can put Linux in your Linux Linux not ting.com Linux not ting.com is not only good a good way

581
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,280
To support the show, but it'll give you $25 off a device or if you bring a device like a pixel

582
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,960
They'll give you $25 in service credit

583
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,160
I would really consider this if you're gonna get the pixel too because tings no contract nor the termination fee and

584
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,640
You only pay for what you use

585
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,760
That's really the secret sauce to ting is if you can be kind of clever if you can download your podcasts

586
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,320
Over Wi-Fi or what I do on Spotify at Spotify on my phone

587
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,240
But I download the tracks on Wi-Fi and they play them offline because I like the super crazy extreme quality

588
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,440
Anyways, I can I so I just use that

589
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:45,120
I just there's just like really four or five things you can do differently and you can save so much money with ting

590
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,400
Yes

591
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:51,520
They just take your minutes your messages and your megabytes and they add them all up and whatever it is at the end of the month

592
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,560
That's all you have to pay

593
00:44:53,560 --> 00:45:00,280
Ting keeps rates simple. We don't make you pick a plan instead. You just use your phone as you normally would how much you use

594
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:04,960
Determines how much you pay each month. You can have as many devices as you want on one account

595
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:05,920
That's good

596
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,120
Because when you use more you pay less per minute message or megabyte of data

597
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:15,320
Your usage plus six dollars per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill

598
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,280
Simple that's what we mean when we say

599
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Mobile that makes sense

600
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:29,200
They also have incredible customer service and a fantastic dashboard you get to speak to a real human being when you call customer service

601
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,660
You're not playing that game

602
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:35,140
And if you do end up with something like the pixel from the Play Store, you can get a ting sim card for $9

603
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,180
You just put it in there you activate it. There's no contract nor the termination fee. Try it out

604
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,840
See how it works for you. Why not? Give it a go. In fact, I don't know

605
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,780
I haven't looked at the pixel

606
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:49,480
But I bet you could choose CDMA or GSM because things got both networks and if the pixels out of your

607
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:55,160
Price range because cheese it is an expensive. Oh, yes. I mean I bought two. Did you really offer a lady one, too?

608
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:00,960
Yeah, yeah. Yeah boy. I mean and that's nice for charging and all that kind of stuff. That's a huge thing

609
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,160
All you can see in USBC household. Yeah, I can understand the future

610
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:05,480
Yeah

611
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,940
If you want to save some cash ting has our semi recent blog post from the 11th about five wise

612
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,040
smartphone choices that are under

613
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:16,000
$200 so if you still want to get a big smartphone that has some functionality that's gonna get some updates

614
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,760
Maybe has a nice camera. They've got a post about that, too. So that's and that's

615
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,080
Super nice because you can either bring your device or grab a device directly from Ting

616
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,680
It's all I just make it so easy

617
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:29,800
Linux dot ting comm and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program

618
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,880
So do you remember a couple of weeks ago?

619
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,780
There were some headlines where Linux they went essentially like this Linus

620
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,840
admits that Linux 4.8 had buggy crap and

621
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:45,300
He raged against it saying there was no effing excuse to knowingly kill a running colonel

622
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,720
And he talks about how he it was his bad

623
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,720
For taking some patches from Andrew right before the 4.8 released. You remember all of this West does this ring about?

624
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,160
Yeah, I believe we touched on it here on this show just a little bit

625
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,760
so what I want to do is I want to take a moment and I want to go a little bit deeper and talk about what

626
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:09,060
They're actually discussing here because this turns out to be a topic that is now giving a lot of Linux critics

627
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,400
some serious fodder and

628
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:18,080
If you heard this you would think oh jeez if you if you're not familiar with intimate details you might think she's

629
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,000
What the hell is Linus doing you know this is Linus

630
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,380
He's raging out once again, and he's acting out of emotion, and he's bad press for the Linux kernel

631
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,940
Yeah, and it's it's I don't know a lot about this West, but I got some clips

632
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,000
I want to play you've had some time to think about it

633
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:38,720
It's about this bug underscore on that led to the Linux kernel stopping and we've got a post

634
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:43,660
linked in the show notes by Samsung's open-source group that say that they

635
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:49,260
They are working this is something they're working on they say it's a top priority for Linus to to change this bug

636
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,500
What are we talking about West? What do we what is bug on? What are we talking about?

637
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,660
bug on is a

638
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,700
kernel function or macro that

639
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,780
At least in some ways is used when is when you see you know when you see a

640
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:08,780
Kernel bug where you're in a position where and this is something they talk about in this in this thread as we'll talk about

641
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:13,640
You know when the kernels in a position where it there's no meaningful error recovery it right now

642
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,380
There's a current trend where it gets used a lot by kernel developers in development

643
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,420
So it's a kind of like in other terms

644
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:22,380
It's similar to like an assert statement where you're basically saying like well at this point

645
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:27,780
Everything that I'm doing this should be true if it's not true, then it's violating one of my assumptions going forward

646
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,580
It doesn't make sense to continue because you know my axioms have been violated

647
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,580
It

648
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,060
Gets used a lot as an development when you haven't written error code

649
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:40,660
You don't know what error code to write yet. You're exploring basically this triggers like oh well

650
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:45,620
The my new feature clearly didn't work crash the kernel we get a stack trace you can begin debugging

651
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:52,300
Sometimes this does then go through into the the real kernel and it does have a place and then part of why I think this

652
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,340
Thread is interesting is it's kind of you get to see the discussion of like yeah, when should this be used?

653
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:02,380
When do we crash the kernel and so it's sort of a discussion around should it be easy to crash the kernel because really

654
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:07,380
You know and and Linus is I think in a good way concerned about I mean

655
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,540
It's not like stupid

656
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,740
bragging uptime concerns

657
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:16,140
But there's lots of places like do you remember the bad press during when Windows 10 rollout when those there was like hospitals in Africa

658
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:20,620
Or other places where their machines were rebooted. So I was you know problems were caused their situations

659
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:23,540
Not in the data center where you don't want to go down

660
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:26,660
Or you won't want to go to the admin to be able to choose to go down yeah

661
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:30,460
And so you know they're very concerned about if there's anything we can do to avoid a situation

662
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,620
You know by all means if you're the file system code

663
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:37,540
And you can't you know you're gonna write damaged data to the drive stop what you're doing

664
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,140
But it doesn't also in that case it might not mean that you absolutely have to crash the whole kernel

665
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,920
So this is what's fascinating about this particular issue because what you just said there seems

666
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:52,480
Absolutely reasonable to me and seems like a likely use case scenario for Linux is number one deployment, which is the server

667
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,440
However Linux critics have taken this and spun this as well

668
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,600
This is Linus sick and tired of bugs crashing his buggy kernel

669
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,780
And they are just paper machine over the problem

670
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:10,040
and they're just suppressing the issue and if you watch this at this week's episode of BSC now a

671
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,680
Popular guest Brian Cantrell was on and they talked about this very issue

672
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:20,480
Brian is I I love every episode of BSC comes in it really is because he is

673
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:26,720
He is such a great Linux critic because he really sticks it and he's so outspoken. I love watching him

674
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,660
He's very opinionated. He's often right on the money. He's a

675
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:36,440
Terribly smart guy yeah, and so he tears in to this particular issue on this week's episode of BSC now

676
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,160
I fully recommend you watch the entire interview

677
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,780
We're gonna play like two minutes from a much longer interview

678
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:47,960
But this is him talking about them switching over from this bug on to something

679
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,640
less dramatic that doesn't stop the kernel and this is what's becoming the sort of

680
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,840
external community take on this particular issue and

681
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,180
Music

682
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,280
Sharp objects away from you. They are going to use like I know

683
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:06,240
Said can fix this bug. Yes said did not fix this bug

684
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:13,120
So they're gonna change every bug on to worn on it's like there I fixed it. It's like

685
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:21,040
Okay, and so now if you actually have a Linux kernel programmer that has I mean

686
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,760
The the poor right-thinking individual that is living in the ghetto of Linux

687
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:33,080
Just trying to do the right thing and has an actual legit bug on if this happens

688
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:39,280
Please panic the system that is now just gonna be turned into a worn on and now you've actually

689
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:46,640
Introduced bugs effectively in systems or certainly made any bugs that do exist in the subsystems much more difficult to debug

690
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,360
It's like how do you come on?

691
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:52,560
I mean, aren't you old enough to I mean like Torvalds and I are about the same age

692
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,520
Like but do you still have this many hormones running through you that you think this is a good idea?

693
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,840
I mean, don't you realize that I mean aren't we getting older and wiser but you know, whatever

694
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,800
Say worn on with butter FS what could possibly?

695
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:13,360
I do love the I got the whole like the system D will recover

696
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,040
Chris there comes a point where it's just like you're clearly you're just piling on here. You're just sorry

697
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,080
Like can I actually make him pass out?

698
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:29,240
I mean you buy you two things for a game are you gonna see if you can actually yeah

699
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,240
I think we have a betting game on the side

700
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:36,080
I mean, I see how long before we can make central stroke out life

701
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,160
My vision is kind of fading right now

702
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,080
So he's so frustrated with Linux that he's about to he's about to stroke out

703
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:50,720
And so you could hear a couple of a couple of assumptions that he's working from and it's not just Brian

704
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,280
Brian is is just a sort of representing an opinion that is forming and

705
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:01,080
I I wanted to address a couple of assumptions that I think he's working from when he makes these statements

706
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,160
you might have noticed that in his world Linus the man is

707
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:11,800
Irrational and makes code commits based on his emotions or as he put it his hormones not rational code commits

708
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,160
Which I think is probably not the correct assumption to make but if you if you believe that to be a fact

709
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,520
You could see how he's built a foundation of some an assumption there another assumption that kind of crops up

710
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:29,040
In his and you'll hear another example here is everyone working on Linux basically kind of just doing it their own way

711
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,040
they're doing it for fun and

712
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:36,240
It kind of ignores the fact that the vast majority of commits to Linux are from business enterprise

713
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,600
Developers who are getting paid by their company. They're serious people

714
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,640
And I want it before we completely respond

715
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:48,100
I want to I want to talk about this particular aspect the way this kind of gets spun and becomes

716
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,000
becomes the reality of the situation and

717
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:57,320
He continues to talk about sort of the pervasive bad thinking that's in Linux that led to things like butter FS

718
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,320
And I want to talk about that too. Did you before we go to that?

719
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,480
Did you want to interject on the on his on his take on the bug on thing?

720
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:13,360
Well, I think him highlighting the said point there they do mention that that is mentioned by a contributor

721
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:19,920
But they what what Linus says that's not that implementation that they would go with and then there's some debate about how it's used

722
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,920
but I think what's really missed is just

723
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:27,960
That the culture has not been using bug on and in this case, it's VM bug on as

724
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:33,760
A like oh, no, we you know, like we messed up the CPU stack and we need to crash

725
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,000
So it's not it hasn't been used in the situation

726
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,540
So and what Linus is really concerned about here is like minimizing that right?

727
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:43,120
And so like the issue is is that once something went out at scale and production

728
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:49,060
It got used in a different way than they intended and this one in particular crept by in like an RC 8 patch level, right?

729
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:54,520
So it's like it wasn't during the regular merge window. It didn't get all the regular testing it should have and like it's okay, right?

730
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:01,520
Yes, there are times. Yeah, he admitted it. It's probably his mistake and I think what he's just saying is that it's really it's it's a

731
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:05,760
Discussion now about like what are the semantics of crashing the kernel?

732
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:11,120
We we should probably make it so that the developer like it doesn't get confused with how you debug

733
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,440
It doesn't get confused with if you had heard that criticism on its surface

734
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,680
From an intelligent person like Brian. I I would think cod Linux is really falling apart, right?

735
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,840
I mean Brian has great credentials

736
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:26,640
He's a super smart guy and he's a joint and I think his argument is right in that like no you should I mean you

737
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,400
Should have asserts right? You should have what I think in Solaris. He says it's verified

738
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:36,280
You should have these things that say like, you know, if if the kernel memory algorithms are working correctly

739
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:41,720
This is this and if it's not we need to crash and Linux does have those and this is a conversation about where do you?

740
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,640
Set that level and what are the semantics of crashing? I also

741
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,520
I mean, I love all I love I love Alan and Chris and and I think Brian's great, too

742
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,600
but I love it when they when they

743
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,000
Poke fun at system D because I don't feel like it

744
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,240
I don't even need to respond to that cuz what I'm gonna do is is like a tiger

745
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,760
I'm gonna I'm gonna sit back and watch my prey and I'm gonna watch them

746
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,440
Take shots at system D for the next couple of years and mark my words five years from now

747
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:10,760
BSD will be fully rolling out their system D equivalent. They won't don't call it that they will be they'll make sure not to call

748
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,300
It that yeah, but the reality is system D

749
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,880
Despite what we might like to think in the Linux community

750
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,320
Not a new idea. No, no, it's not Sun was working on

751
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:28,480
Is it SMF SMF? Yeah. Yeah, and of course Apple had launch D. Mm-hmm

752
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:35,000
And I remember using launch D can configure services before system D was even a thing. Yeah. Hey, this is pretty sweet

753
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,160
I believe there are two if not three projects in the BSD community already to replicate system D like functionality

754
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,160
It's just none of them are necessarily mainstream

755
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,840
It's coming

756
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:50,520
So just as it just sit back as a tiger and watch your prey as they poke poke fun at system D now and then when

757
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,760
They will roll it out and all the all of the logical backflips

758
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:59,040
They'll have to do to explain why it's nothing like system D. So but let's go on about the pervasive bad thinking in Linux

759
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,800
This is a common. This is a common BSD culture

760
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:08,160
Projection on the Linux community that Brian manages to put in really great summed up words

761
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,840
And so this is a great point to sort of look at something that I think is a common misconception

762
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,280
No, they actually won't

763
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:19,640
And the other thing I think that is that is that is actively happening to Linux

764
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:25,560
I think this is the kind of the peril that they run is that right thinking individuals are not attracted to that culture

765
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,300
I don't think he means like politically right? I think he means right brain

766
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:33,640
They're talking about right-brained people earlier in this so right brain versus left brain

767
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:38,120
The the thing is he's saying is that Linux doesn't attract the right type of critical thinkers

768
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,160
right thinking individuals are not attracted to that culture and so

769
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,400
People even if you're interested in file systems, are you gonna go in your?

770
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:54,920
22 are you gonna go work on butter of us? Are you gonna go work on ZFS if you are interested in operating systems?

771
00:57:54,920 --> 00:58:00,760
Are you going to go to a culture that is replacing bug-ons with worn-ons?

772
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,400
Are you gonna go to the BSDs or to a Lumos or what have you where you got?

773
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:09,920
Cultures that are not just more innovative but also more rigorous than they're thinking

774
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,200
Yeah, so cultures are subjective for the eye of the beholder

775
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,880
But if I'm 22 years old and I want to get a career in this field

776
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,360
I'm probably gonna go with the platform that has the demonstra

777
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:25,160
Just on German. What is the word demonstrably demonstrably larger deployment in the server space?

778
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,240
That's what I'm trying to say. I mean think about it. If you if you want an employable skill, it's obvious

779
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,000
The choice is obvious

780
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:38,600
So I kind of disagree with the premise to begin with but his core his core message is the way the culture is the professionalism

781
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,040
That's more appealing in BSD and people that think that way or a Lumos

782
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:51,800
Yeah, or a Lumos which is which is his baby interested in operating systems. Are you going to go to a culture that is

783
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:57,600
Replacing bug-ons with worn-ons or are you going to go to the BSDs or to a Lumos or what have you where you got?

784
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:05,560
Cultures that are not just more innovative but also more rigorous than they're thinking and I think that you know in an all-open-source world

785
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:12,560
There's total freedom of choice for technologists and the differentiators become almost the the cultures and these cultures become

786
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:19,360
Self-perpetuating and so they I think there's there's a danger that you end up with with butter offenses over and over and over again

787
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:26,720
Yeah, and I mean I just wonder how many of these is it gonna take before people kind of like connect the dots that okay

788
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:32,520
Let's talk about that point how many times we have gonna screw something up before we admit

789
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:38,960
That sometimes we just we think that there's bad ideas and we should just move on. I think he's kind of right

790
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:44,080
I think you still have butter fs defenders out there who are gonna argue with this very moment in this show

791
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:44,400
Yeah

792
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,680
Even though it's so obvious to everybody else watching from like a distance

793
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,960
That if you're an enterprise and you have serious data needs you're not going to deploy butter fs

794
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:59,560
That system is worked out to be for yeah, and it has enabled an entire product category for some companies out there

795
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:04,000
I will say it is interesting though. Just given Facebook's use of it. It is probably has a

796
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,520
Comparable number of deployments now. It's just that it's not for data. It's not for data reliability

797
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:14,280
You know, what are we going off with that Facebook thing though? I mean, I'm not if you're right if you're right

798
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:19,800
Then that probably is a massive deployment. But here's what I've heard. I've heard

799
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:27,160
Several things I've heard that that story is old and out of date trip. I've also heard that those systems run on RAM

800
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:32,760
The storage is RAM based the RAM disks and they wipe them every 24 hours. I

801
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:39,120
Could see that as well. So I I mean, oh no, and I'm not I'm not trying to argue for butter fs as a

802
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:44,600
Data storage solution, but that was always our go-to about our fast like well Facebook true

803
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,600
We had that we had that that was our go-to

804
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:52,680
But I don't actually know how much that holds up and I mean you don't see a huge number of patches these days or

805
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,320
that much improvement

806
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,400
But here's where I really think he starts to make a better point

807
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:05,080
he really kind of nails it when he talks about the the fundamental issue that I always had with butter fs and I couldn't put

808
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,080
into words as well as Brian does here is

809
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:11,480
It butter fs should have been production-ready

810
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:17,800
From the beginning it didn't have to be feature complete, but it should have been production-ready

811
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,840
cultures become

812
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:25,800
Self-perpetuating and so they I think there's there's a danger that you end up with with butter fesses over and over and over again

813
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:32,840
Yeah, and I I mean I just wonder how many of these is it gonna take before people kind of like connect the dots that there's

814
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:36,680
Actually something there are broader differences than simply the technology

815
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,080
Befuddled me was how they didn't catch this sooner

816
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:45,400
Because the test case they did for it if you know create the raid Zed and like DD zeros into one of the drives and then

817
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,040
run a scrub

818
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:52,780
Right free BSD handbook has every news NFS user do that on purpose to watch

819
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,660
To show them how a scrub works and repairs the data

820
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,620
Like right our newbie guide has every user

821
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:06,900
Do that exact experiment to prove that ZFS works and no one had ever done it with butter fs ever

822
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,020
What?

823
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:14,460
Well, and I think that this is the idea well you wouldn't do it because it's not ready for production yet

824
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:18,260
It's like yeah, it would be mean to do that because it's not it's like no

825
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:21,580
That's just setting us up for failure when also that doesn't it doesn't understand

826
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:27,340
What software is is born ready for production or not?

827
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:31,560
And if you the software that is especially software in the data path

828
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:36,900
It's not you don't make it ready for production later. It's like security

829
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:43,020
you don't retrofit it on to an extant system you either design it for production use or

830
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:45,660
you don't and

831
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,900
It's not something that you as methodically approach

832
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:54,940
Yes, there will be bugs in the system, but the bugs in a system that that is actually designed for production use

833
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:57,860
That is actually a salvageable system bugs in a system

834
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:03,660
That was never actually designed for production use or thought that production use something that would be done later or by the little people

835
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:11,140
It is not actually tenable and with ZFS ZFS was people don't realize this that ZFS was designed

836
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:14,420
To be used in production from day zero

837
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:20,020
So it's it just that it didn't have features in the beginning so I think that's a pretty fair point actually

838
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:25,060
And I think the the lesson learned from butter FS is a change in our perspective

839
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:29,540
Let's not wait for something to be production ready. It's just it's not

840
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:31,660
1997 anymore

841
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:34,940
we're just in a different we're in a different world now when it comes to this stuff and

842
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:41,740
Like it or not. How serious is used right? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and it's happening on people's laptop

843
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:47,380
It's happening on people's phones and it's happening on people's servers if you want to if you want to follow more episode

844
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,780
163 of the BSC now program the return of the control right episode

845
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:55,000
It was actually it was your suggestion because you'd watch and said we should talk about this

846
01:03:55,500 --> 01:04:01,620
So thanks for thanks for the suggestion because I actually think it's good to talk about our weaknesses

847
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:05,180
Oh, yeah, absolutely, and it's good to be completely honest

848
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:10,220
But at the same time we do need to call it when people are maybe spreading a little bit of FUD

849
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:15,520
Especially around that bug on thing. That's just that's just fun. If you follow it closely enough, that's just straight-up fun

850
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:21,660
Yeah, you want to criticize you want to criticize us as a community about butter fs and say that maybe the culture of Linux

851
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,700
Allows projects like butter fs to succeed

852
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:31,260
Okay, maybe that just sounds like a really active vibrant huge worldwide community

853
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:34,220
That's just many factors larger than the BSD community

854
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:37,540
Well and ignores other subsystem communities as well as you know

855
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:42,660
I mean, it's not like we haven't had successful production file systems before and it's not that we won't have them again

856
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:48,740
But and we so we need the realistic criticism as well as an up-to-date assessment of the and it's not like you can't get see

857
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:50,300
You can't you can get ZFS right now

858
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:55,660
It's like that's not the the reality is Linux is such a natural force in the technology

859
01:04:55,660 --> 01:05:00,380
industry that if you want your product to be relevant on the server, it has to work on Linux and

860
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:04,900
That even is true for ZFS

861
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:08,180
But it was a really good interview and there's a lot of good stuff they talk about and

862
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:14,380
I hope to have some of this very discussion with Brian in person at meet BSD. Oh, hey

863
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:19,740
Yeah, he's good. I think he's gonna be there the whole more about this the whole BSD now crew Alan's gonna be down there

864
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:22,260
Chris Moore is gonna be down there

865
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:27,260
Producer q5 sis is gonna be down there. I mean like it's a it's a full

866
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:29,060
BSD

867
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:32,500
Now crew plus Brian's gonna be there and

868
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,020
I'm gonna be there. It's November 11th or the 12th

869
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:40,020
Here's what I decided to do. This is I haven't I have not mentioned this yet on any shows

870
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:44,580
But I've gotten a few emails about it. I've got a couple of tweets about it people like hey

871
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:47,140
can we meet up while you're in the San Francisco area and

872
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,340
We really had this tight

873
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:54,980
Hadeah and I we plan to be there for the 11th and the 12th and then the other time was spent driving from

874
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:58,980
Washington and back and it was her idea. She said you know what? Why don't we just

875
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:02,020
Let's just take a couple extra days. I'll take a couple of days off from work

876
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:07,060
Maybe Noah can fill it on a show and let's spend a little time down there and let's let's meet up with some folks

877
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:11,780
So I will probably be also be in in the area the following Monday or Tuesday

878
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:16,500
And what I plan to do is I'll get down there. I'll get me BSD get my head around that and then I'm gonna start

879
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:21,380
Tweeting out what my plans are if you're in the San Francisco area and want to meet up email me Chris at Jupiter

880
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:26,100
Broadcasting comm or tweet me even better at Chris LAS. Let's start talking about sounds like a good idea

881
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:31,220
That sounds awesome because I kind of what I want it what I would like to do is maybe rent a car or maybe Ben

882
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:34,420
I'll let me let borrow his car an extra day if maybe and

883
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:40,500
Drive into San Francisco and just hang out and maybe people could show me some cool places and

884
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:43,460
Maybe we'll shoot a little rover log and all that kind of stuff

885
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:46,820
I think it could be a lot of fun. So I'm gonna take a couple extra days

886
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:48,900
Just you know, we have a lot of viewers

887
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:53,860
We have a lot we have thousands and thousands of viewers in the California area in the specific area

888
01:06:53,860 --> 01:07:01,860
It's and so if you're in if you've ever wanted to see Chris last in person and maybe maybe show me your favorite place to eat

889
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:04,180
Maybe I'll do like a tour. I'll go Alden Brown

890
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:05,860
I'll just like I'll go around drink like

891
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:11,860
Coffees from all different places and have donuts and just get like all kinds of grub on and then record all for the rover log

892
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:15,460
That could be fun. And I think I think I'm gonna be there Monday or Tuesday

893
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:20,260
I'm gonna take one of those days and use it for a meetup and one of those days to play the tourist thing and just

894
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:25,460
Like take a day off and actually enjoy the area so that I'm hoping to have two extra days in San Francisco

895
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:28,980
And I want to use one of them to spend it with the audience and one of it to do the tourist thing

896
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:33,860
So I don't know which ones yet, but it'll be Monday and Tuesday and I'll I'll say more

897
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:37,140
I'll probably on my Twitter account at Chris. Oh, yes, but if you're gonna be at meet BSD

898
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:40,100
I'd love to see you or if you're in the Berkeley area and want to meet up

899
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:47,060
Let's do it meet BSD comm by the way, if I think I'm I I'm gonna tell you

900
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:52,420
If you're gonna go to one BSD event in 2016, I think this is the one it really seems like it now

901
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,580
There's some international ones that are pretty badass, too

902
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:58,420
But if you're gonna go to one in the US this year, there's probably other great ones coming up

903
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:00,900
But if you're gonna go to one, I think that might be BSD returns home

904
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:05,380
That's what they pretty Berkeley. Yeah. Yeah, the Berkeley systems distribution, right? All right

905
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:13,460
So let's talk about our next sponsor DigitalOcean go over to digitalocean.com and use our very special promo code of absolute power and knowledge

906
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:16,740
DO Unplugged it's one word. It's lowercase

907
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:22,420
You go create an account you go in their dashboard you apply it as your payment method

908
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:27,940
Now you're not putting a credit card in there. You're not putting your pay pals in there or whatever's they've got your back

909
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:32,100
You're going in there. You're putting in DO Unplugged. You're getting a $10 credit

910
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:35,860
Actually, if you already have an account too, and you you know, you you've not used our promo code

911
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:42,100
You can also get a credit. What a deal. I know digitalocean.com is a great way to get a $10 credit

912
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:46,340
What a deal. I know digitalocean is super cool to let you right think they've already got you

913
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:49,220
They didn't have to let you do that. Not at all. That's really cool

914
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:52,420
And so that's kind of gives you an insight to what a badass company they are

915
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,500
They're a really great simple cloud hosting provider

916
01:08:54,820 --> 01:09:01,000
Dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin up your own super fast system on their infrastructure

917
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:04,260
They're all linux

918
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:06,260
They use KVM for the virtualization

919
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:09,380
SSD for the back end storage. So everything's super fast

920
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:13,860
You know it and you get to pick from all of the distros that you would run on a server

921
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:16,740
Plus free bsd if you're a bsd folk

922
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:22,660
And and and there's some cool things you can do when you start playing with their block storage and zfs

923
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:24,340
There is some cool things you can do

924
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:27,060
But really you can get started for five bucks five bucks a month

925
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:29,540
If you use our promo code do unplug you get $10 two months for free

926
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,260
Whoa, you can get started in less than a minute

927
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,900
You'll get a really nice system

928
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:40,020
And they have an interface that even if you've never set up a server before you'll be able actually it's so easy

929
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:45,860
If you've never installed linux even you could do it. You really you really could but what what I think is probably more

930
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:50,980
Noteworthy and remarkable about that is first of all, they've managed to do this in a web application second of all

931
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:52,740
They manage to do in a browser

932
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:57,140
Compatible compatible way that works like on your on your phone. It works on your linux box

933
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:01,960
You don't have to have java installed. You don't have flash installed. Yeah, you get a full html5

934
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:06,060
Console access to your rig. That's all nice. Yep

935
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:08,820
but beginners or

936
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:14,100
Advanced users that have been setting up systems for decades are going to be happy with this and then on top of that if you

937
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:18,300
Even know how to poke at ruby or php or python you can use their api

938
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:22,540
Like you can if you just know how to poke and they have tons of great open source applications

939
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:24,540
You can just take advantage of already

940
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:30,140
It's amazing. It's a great service and they're super fast and they got data centers in new york, san francisco

941
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:34,780
Singapore Amsterdam, london, toronto, germany and india so you can be like a boss all over the world

942
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,820
Just use our promo code do unplugged

943
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:43,500
I mean it is so awesome to see how linux and kvm can bring

944
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:50,520
The fundamental technologies to a company where they can focus on the things like the api the interface the documentation the community

945
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:58,120
Finally somebody took advantage of all of it and that's digital ocean digital ocean comm just use our promo code

946
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:02,240
Do unplugged and a big thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring

947
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,680
the unplugged program

948
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:10,880
So we were kind of kvotsing about this a little bit ago in the show and we were talking about how most people in the enterprise

949
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:15,740
Don't give a single crap that the canonical livepatch client is

950
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:22,680
Commercial software or that the back end is managed by launchpad, which is commercial software, right? They could the

951
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,320
businesses that are more than ten people

952
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:33,720
Okay, I've never met a single one of them that would care unless their business is linux and open like system 76

953
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:37,960
They care right I don't but like there's like even less a lot of the enterprises

954
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:42,520
That's not what they're concerned if your business isn't open source and Linux you don't you don't give any shits

955
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:47,320
You really don't and let's be honest with this and and mumble room you feel field just disagree with me

956
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:54,280
But I thought this post over at naughty computer dot UK, which is a great domain name was pretty good

957
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:59,800
It says the role of free software in a world that doesn't care the free software movement is about personal and social

958
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,900
liberties giving the owner and the user of a computer control over it

959
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:11,560
But most people don't see the problem with a small number of multinational mega corporations having control over everyone's computers

960
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:18,840
They think Apple and Microsoft know what they're doing and they do a good job

961
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:22,860
So why would I need free software I?

962
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:27,740
Can see a lot of people's thoughts like that or or even worse?

963
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:34,420
They've never even thought of heard of or conceptualize a world of free software

964
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:38,100
They only see a world of apps and commercial software

965
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:45,860
And I would suspect without I mean I would I would find it very hard to dispute the idea that that is must that must

966
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:53,140
Be the very vast majority of consumers mm-hmm. I won't meet him and that's a that's a default right you need your next program

967
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:56,220
You you buy it off the shelf you get it for however long and support it

968
01:12:56,220 --> 01:13:00,540
And then you buy the new one my lady friend is a good example before she met me

969
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:04,140
I think she had heard Linux mentioned as the thing that

970
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:09,860
Runs her server and she knew a couple of computer people that sometimes talked about Linux

971
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:13,260
but she didn't know that it was free or that it was open and

972
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:20,540
she didn't really ever even consider that there was such a thing because everything else in our life that we interact with is

973
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:27,140
Product eyes commercialized specialty thing you got to get by that model. It's branded. It's it's

974
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:28,460
Marketed yep

975
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:35,380
So you don't even your mo your mind doesn't even shift to that mode to understand that there could be something like free software

976
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:37,580
This country is created not by a company

977
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:45,140
But by a system of volunteers who are each scratching their own itch that idea isn't something that you just consider

978
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:49,340
You have to be introduced to it and like my lady friend when I introduced her to it

979
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,820
She well this is obviously the better way to go

980
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:54,020
This is unquestionably even as a I mean

981
01:13:54,020 --> 01:14:00,220
I'm a small business person with like a couple of people working here, and this seems like an obviously good choice for my business

982
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:04,240
But until you understand and see it you don't you don't even conceptualize it

983
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:10,800
So, what is the role of free software in a world where that is perhaps arguably the reality?

984
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,800
Mom or do you have any thoughts?

985
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,720
Yeah, I think

986
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:23,240
The problem is that they don't understand the whole computer thing

987
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,520
It's not the thing that they don't care. They don't understand

988
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:31,400
So it's some kind of such protection to pretend that Microsoft and Apple care for them

989
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:35,320
Hmm, because you trust in a brand you trust in the name

990
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:40,200
Yeah, because really if they screwed it up so bad. They'd be out of business

991
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,920
Yeah, but if you don't know

992
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:50,920
You know how to drive a car, but you don't know what the car is doing

993
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:55,640
You don't know the whole moat. I don't know how to build the car. No, I couldn't replace my car's computer. No

994
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,360
so

995
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:06,080
So it's the same thing for a computer user a normal computer user does not know what the computer is doing

996
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,480
He can only

997
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,200
consume

998
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:16,360
Software and use software but doesn't know how it works. So it's yeah Mosenrath your thoughts

999
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:23,120
Okay, so if you can see in the the the chat room there we've been discussing it as well

1000
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:26,760
but a lot of it is off of it's not a matter of really an

1001
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:31,120
active not knowing or an active not caring what they see is as

1002
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:37,480
The previous person said they just see a product they use it and as I was saying to others does it work?

1003
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:41,160
Yes, then they use that product. They don't know if it's free

1004
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,480
they don't know if it's

1005
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:48,840
Not free in terms of free as in speech not free as in beer as that is one of the main things that comes up

1006
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:55,400
Quite often but in terms of the see cult was just it's like the cell free software commercial software could be for your

1007
01:15:55,400 --> 01:16:02,200
Proprietary, right? It's a matter of does it work? It does. Okay. I'm good. I'm out

1008
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:05,960
They're not worried about any of the other stuff because they know full well

1009
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:11,320
Microsoft doesn't care about them Apple doesn't care about them. You know what those companies care about

1010
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:17,560
Well companies always care about your pocketbook your wallet the moment that you open it up

1011
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:24,920
They are happy to talk to you you close it up the conversation ends you go to something like say Cody or VLC

1012
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:31,560
They say we don't need your pocketbook. The person says hey, I don't need to open up my wallet. Awesome

1013
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:36,880
I'll use this. Yeah, it works. Excellent. I'm out. Yeah, so

1014
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,760
This is where I find the absolute

1015
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,200
brilliant silver lining in this concept

1016
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:51,280
because so often as users who perhaps are

1017
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:55,240
just solely consumers of open-source software

1018
01:16:55,240 --> 01:17:00,000
Maybe you you download the latest distribution you install all the great open-source software

1019
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:04,360
Maybe you caveats online in the comment section about something not working

1020
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:10,600
But you don't very often or if ever submit a bug perhaps you don't submit a patch upstream

1021
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,460
You don't necessarily get involved in the mailing list

1022
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:17,420
You primarily consume

1023
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,600
But you do something else too

1024
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,960
you

1025
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,760
likely advocate

1026
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:30,320
You spread the word about Linux you show maybe a friend who gets intellectually curious and it turns out

1027
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,760
that's

1028
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:38,680
fundamental to the survival of free software and so as regular Linux users we have an

1029
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:46,500
Absolute vital role in the entire ecosystem of free software and its continuation and survival and I don't I don't think it's

1030
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:51,860
Overselling it to say that this is one of the most important roles in free software is advocacy and education

1031
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:54,860
Now how you do it the people you do it to

1032
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:58,140
That could all be argued. That's the nuance

1033
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:03,820
But there is such an important place for advocacy still even in 2016

1034
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:07,740
Even when Linux has taken over the cloud and networking and mobile

1035
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,820
This is still a fundamental issue and

1036
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:18,260
There are people who are not even in tech who are not even necessarily tech heads or technologists

1037
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:26,500
Who can see the benefits it just has to be a certain person who's intellectually curious about these things or has a motivation to learn

1038
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,860
more and

1039
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:31,460
If you you know look at Noah look how many people he switches to Linux and daily

1040
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:36,900
Conversations just by like kind of just by sussing out their needs and yeah, well, here's how Linux could fix that for you

1041
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:42,220
And here's how it's all that for you instant right like you don't have to wait to talk to a sales rep you don't

1042
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:47,580
Have to it's just it's there. It's your right to have it. It's yeah, you've always had it

1043
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:52,220
You just didn't know I and it may also I suppose this is very self-serving

1044
01:18:52,220 --> 01:19:00,260
I guess but it makes me very proud to to run a network that has many programs that talk about Linux and

1045
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:06,660
open-source and BSD and and help people learn and discover more about it and make it useful in their daily lives because I

1046
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:09,500
really truly believe that advocacy is a

1047
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:15,280
Crucial part to the free software ecosystem, and if you've ever felt bad about maybe being a leech like that

1048
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:20,660
If you've played that role, or you can play that role you are taking part now

1049
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:25,740
You can do more at any time, and I encourage you to do so but there that is there's something to that Wes

1050
01:19:25,740 --> 01:19:27,740
I think that's pretty cool

1051
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:29,820
and

1052
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:35,700
That right there brings us to the end of this week's episode of the unplugged program if you'd like to join us live

1053
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:38,100

1060
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:31,660
And you made it this far give it a thumbs up come on come on all right. We'll see you back here next Tuesday

1061
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:35,100
So

1062
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:45,100
I

1063
01:20:55,180 --> 01:21:00,580
So we're gonna start giving these away or selling them. I'm not sure look amazing. Yeah, I think it's a super great idea I

1064
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:05,980
Think you could probably sell a whole sheet of them. I don't think see and I think she's just thinking about giving a few

1065
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:07,980
Away at a time, but I think you could probably just so yeah

1066
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:13,380
Yeah, I would because then why then I just happen for my future keyboards. I don't want that window shame all right

1067
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:17,060
So I'm trying to cover up my super key like I got mine on I got it

1068
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:20,660
It's a little tiny bit lopsided, but that's oh look at my pop

1069
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:27,500
That's all mine mine's my my super key actually had a circular indent to begin with so I'm pretty happy

1070
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:31,900
It's not great, but you see that looks like it fits in right in there doesn't wow yeah, that's nice

1071
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,700
so

1072
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,820
Yeah, that's our that's our super key, but yeah, yeah, yeah, so how's it look on yours?

1073
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:43,940
Actually, not too bad. I'd say it looks as good. I'd say it actually looks better than the Ubuntu sticker

1074
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:50,460
That's on the Librem 15. Yeah, so hmm. I wonder how it look if your keyboard lit up. Oh your keyboard does light up

1075
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:55,340
Not too bad. It looks fine good. I was wondering if it would shine through, but yeah, it looks good I

1076
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:56,740
I

1077
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:59,420
Like it. Yeah, it does have a little bit of a shine. I'd say ah

1078
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:06,020
Very good very good, so you approve it. Oh, man. This is great everyone should get them

1079
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:08,100
It's funny because you know when you think stickers you think big stuff

1080
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:12,240
But that little tiny super key sticker is legit, and I hate seeing that little Windows key

1081
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,540
And I like you know most of the people should I have yeah, I don't have them

1082
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:17,580
I know I know you can't do anything about the most of the way

1083
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:22,160
I wish you know Microsoft they really they really had I wonder how they pulled that off

1084
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:28,220
I would like to know this the history of the Windows key and how they worked like what I envision is I

1085
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:31,860
Envision like they nailed a couple of manufacturers

1086
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:36,500
And then the industry just decided to take off with it was easier to just have it all under yeah

1087
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,580
Oh

1088
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:42,620
Look at that dos keyboard sells a Linux keycap bundle. That's awesome excellent

1089
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:47,140
It seems to be a lot of people are getting into replacing getting keyboards where they can individually replace the keycaps

1090
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:48,800
Which is none of my keyboards?

1091
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,860
I can do that with but I don't like any of my keyboards a whole lot except for my Logitech upstairs, okay?

1092
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:56,280
Yeah, but like that seems a lot like a lot of fiddling

1093
01:22:57,140 --> 01:23:00,660
But at the end you end up with something you've crafted you have great pride in it

1094
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:07,420
You'd have a lot of you have to have some free time though. That's not something you have a concept up. Oh, I see yep

1095
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,380
Theoretically I can do that when my gateway laptop

1096
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:14,340
Really it has keycaps on a huh?

1097
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:17,020
Yeah, I learned that the hard way

1098
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:21,340
About six years back and then when I went into a bit of rage

1099
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:27,960
And then accidentally pop the you keep loose from the keyboard and that's why I had to quickly put it back on there before

1100
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,840
Anybody noticed all right?

1101
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,740
Well, we got ten Fridays left or nine Fridays left until Christmas

1102
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:35,200
So you guys have enough time to get me a mechanical keyboard for Christmas?

1103
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,600
I'm a kid. I don't I would not well actually I would probably use one

1104
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:42,120
But not in studio, so you'd never get to see me using it because it'd be too loud. I would assume

1105
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:47,000
Yeah, get one of the quieter ones, but then what's the point don't they not feel as good well?

1106
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I mean, there's there's many different

1107
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,140
actuation

1108
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:51,920
Love it. You know you can get lots of different feels

1109
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:57,460
I have a code keyboard at home with the clear keycaps, which I like that. They're not too loud

1110
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:59,420
I mean, I don't know if they'd be quite enough for the studio

1111
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:02,340
But I bet you could find something and you can still be you know a lot of them

1112
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:09,620
So I have nicer construction anyway, okay, so oh wait. Yeah, you know a deeper. So are you are you telling me that I?

1113
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:15,500
Can I my understanding is that if you want the right feeling like you want that old?

1114
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:16,960
old

1115
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:22,720
mechanical keyboard feeling from back in the early 90s 80s and 70s or whatever the hell you know almost like

1116
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:27,220
Clunk clunk clunk. I thought in order to get the right feeling you had to have a certain amount of sound

1117
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:29,360
I thought there was you can't divorce the two

1118
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:35,520
I thought so I thought if I as I begin to compromise on the amount of sound I also compromise on the feel is

1119
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:41,240
That true I mean if I think if you're trying to read exactly recreate like the IBM buckling spring type switches

1120
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:46,840
Then yeah, maybe you do, but I think there's a range of things that people like and that people appreciate and for different purposes

1121
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:51,380
Right like a lot of gamers like the cherry MX red style series where it's like a linear press

1122
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:54,220
So I think there's a wide range you might not find one

1123
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:56,460
That's it you might find the you know like a loud one that you like more

1124
01:24:56,460 --> 01:25:00,460
But I think you can find something that's better than say that little Apple keyboard. You've got over there

1125
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:07,140
Yeah, although I mean, but I think one thing here's one key so one thing I'll touch on there

1126
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:12,640
So I first of all I'm afraid of my own personality when it comes to quieter keyboards

1127
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:15,100
I'll get there, but to the Apple thing. I'm not a huge fan of them

1128
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:19,620
But I also don't I don't hate them and one thing that if I was an Apple user

1129
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:22,740
I think I would appreciate is I'm not positive, but I think

1130
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:26,300
I'm not sure if this is true anymore actually maybe it's not true anymore

1131
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:31,860
But for a long time like they had the same keyboard layout across the laptops and their physical keyboards

1132
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:38,060
So you could interchange. I mean it was it was that that that muscle memory worked across a range of the products

1133
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:42,900
Which is a great idea going back to the mechanical keyboard thing and I don't know if that's true anymore for Apple

1134
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:45,200
But then what here's why I don't want to get quieter keys

1135
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:49,420
This is the type of person I am I I have two modes

1136
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:53,460
I don't give a I don't care about the quality of this thing

1137
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:58,320
Mm-hmm or I care about the quality of it sure and if I care about the quality of it very best

1138
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:03,060
And and if I don't what I'll do is I'll first buy the I'll buy the low-level one then I'll buy the mid-level one

1139
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:07,140
And I'll try I know I will try to stay there as long as I can and I will guilt myself

1140
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:12,900
I will internally beat myself up for wanting the better one when I have already bought the low one and the mid one and I'll fight

1141
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:17,540
With myself, and it'll be like this ongoing thing that steals brain CPU for days or months

1142
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:22,980
And depending on the price sometimes a year or you know and then I finally make the go and I love it

1143
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,640
I love it way way more like for example

1144
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:30,980
Perfect example, I bought the the rover right it was a great price

1145
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:34,420
I got it on I forget consignment, so I got a great deal on it

1146
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:38,480
And it was a nice travel trailer was a mid-level travel trailer

1147
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:42,940
and then once I realized that I actually liked living in a tiny space and

1148
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:50,500
That I liked the concept of our being and I liked how I liked how it's I use less I I consume less

1149
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,500
I liked all the things about it, and then it was

1150
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:56,240
Well now if I'm going to do this. I'm gonna do it right

1151
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,400
I don't I don't want to and I didn't go out and buy like some

1152
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:02,080
$300,000 diesel pusher I mean I have my limits of due to budget

1153
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:07,780
But I I knew I knew almost within the moment. I knew I liked our being I knew then immediately

1154
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:12,360
I was gonna be getting a class a RV at some point because I'm not gonna if I know I can do better and that same

1155
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:17,520
Thing applies to production like I if I'm working on if I'm editing or I'm putting together something

1156
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:19,740
And I know it could be a little better. I'm not gonna stop there

1157
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:24,720
I'll go till it's as best as I can get it and so I'm worried about what the keyboard thing is that if I start

1158
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:30,360
Caring about that. I will really care about that and then and then I'm really in a world of hurt because what do I do?

1159
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:35,300
Do I start replacing all my keyboards and then some keyboards don't feel right so so far

1160
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:41,300
What I have what I have allowed myself to do is I have a keyboard that I really like to use

1161
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:43,300
Okay, and I would be sad if it went away

1162
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:49,620
But I I don't let myself go any further in fear of have you found this to be true for yourself once you start

1163
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:55,580
Looking into super nice keyboards. Did you slip into a keyboard like a keyboard snob range now?

1164
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:58,260
Yeah, I think I was ready to become a keyboard snob

1165
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:02,920
I have not as far as replacing everything I think the next on my list is getting one really nice one for work

1166
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:04,380
What if you think about it, dude?

1167
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:11,220
Like there are a few things in my life that my hands touch more of right and like that's one of the things you do

1168
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:15,020
Let you consider yourself good at right like just be good with computers. It's a huge part of my work

1169
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:19,700
It's a huge part of my hobby. It's it's like it's such a fundamental thing. Oh god now

1170
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:24,260
I'm starting to care and I can also appreciate that like it's hard to like you you have to know like alright

1171
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:27,100
Well if I'm gonna do this like I'm you can't do it half-assed, right?

1172
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:30,720
You cannot you're gonna have to do it. Well, and that's takes a lot of research and time. Yeah

1173
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:32,820
Sometimes it's just so don't okay

1174
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:36,660
So I so somebody who must have been listening to Koda radio because this has been on my mind yet

1175
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:41,340
It looks like t3 hit t3 late in the chat room is asking about I have a keyboard upstairs

1176
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:47,980
This is my favorite keyboard and it is a logitech that runs Linux and I can't remember if it's like a

1177
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:51,900
It's a gaming keyboard. I think it might be the g15. Let me go look

1178
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:56,340
And it's an older. No. No, that's not it. That's not the g15

1179
01:28:56,500 --> 01:29:00,620
It's got a flip up LCD screen and it's it's super old

1180
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:05,420
I actually did I'd actually use it as a runs Linux once on last because I mean, how could I not right?

1181
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:08,060
Yeah, the damn thing actually runs Linux with a little flip up screen

1182
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:12,780
And it's supposed to have like these widgets that interact with your computer and there is some Linux software

1183
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:19,460
So here is a version of it this nope, that isn't it either but it looks kind of like this with an LCD screen

1184
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:22,060
It's a logitech. I

1185
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:27,080
Can't remember but it is it has a great feel to it. It's not all the way

1186
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:30,780
Crazy, but I really like to visit here. It is this is it right here

1187
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:33,540
I really like the positioning of all of the keys

1188
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:38,580
I like the one of the things I really like about it is it has this roller knob right here

1189
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:40,540
That's sunken into the keyboard for volume

1190
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:43,520
yeah, and then a dedicated mute switch and then

1191
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:47,420
logical playback controls that are laid out like they normally would be on a

1192
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:52,620
Player device with play pause and skip tracks right there. I think like you'd find on your stereo or whatever

1193
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:58,940
Yeah, so this is the logitech g19 and I don't even think they oh they make newer ones. Hmm interesting and

1194
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:03,940
I don't know about any more but the version I have which does run a little warm

1195
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:09,380
Has a Linux a Linux computer in there to do all the little witty stuff. Yeah, some

1196
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:15,940
Ancient old version. Oh god. I'm sure I can only imagine so undefined. Let's see the new version

1197
01:30:15,940 --> 01:30:18,620
Oh, they don't even tell me the price because Amazon doesn't sell it directly

1198
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:25,300
But it looks like you can get it used from a reseller for a hundred bucks, but new it's 280

1199
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:29,940
280 290 here it is. Yeah, I think I remembered spending quite a bit on this

1200
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:33,900
But you know looking back up looking back at it. Now. I have had it for a

1201
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:39,420
Really long time. I mean I bought the first version that they years ago

1202
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:44,260
And so I think the investment paid off you and for for for the idea

1203
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:51,700
Here's the idea is while you're working on the LCD screen. You're looking at your you're looking at your CPU usage

1204
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:54,020
You're looking at your memory stats like it's a little mini top

1205
01:30:54,020 --> 01:31:01,300
I do like that that's neat right or temperatures and of course they have a whole bunch of shitty software that makes it work automatically with

1206
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:03,700
Windows, but there were ways eventually to get it work on Linux

1207
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:04,540
But you know what?

1208
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:07,820
I have not I had probably haven't bothered setting that up in two three years

1209
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:11,520
I can think see that really handy if you could just like redirect one terminals output

1210
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:14,800
Yeah, one of the other things you could redirect to it was VLC

1211
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:19,180
So you could redirect VLC playback on the LCD screen Wow

1212
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:24,820
Yeah, which was so cool for like just watching a little video or something also playback

1213
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:30,900
You could you could see that like the track information stuff like that for like maybe a if your music application supported that

1214
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:33,020
It was nice

1215
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:34,900
Notifications notifications could go down there, too

1216
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:37,020
But again, I I don't even know if it works and works

1217
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:39,900
I probably haven't bothered setting up for two years is the version today

1218
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:43,140
I just duct-taped my phone to the top keyboard. I just actually dude

1219
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:48,260
That's exactly what I use that screen for a lot is because the screen rotates up and down it

1220
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:52,580
And I so I haven't pivoted up and I lay my lay my script my cell phone on it

1221
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:54,900
And it's the perfect cell phone holder right there on my keyboard

1222
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:10,020
May I jump in yeah. Yeah, there is indeed a software again gnome 15 is called

1223
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:17,600
Before there was the gnome 15 daemon daemon, but that's not maintained anymore. So now they use gnome 15

1224
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:20,600
You can have a look at gnome 15 org

1225
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:27,580
Well, you have to compile it yourself. It's not in the repository any distribution. I used I gave it a try

1226
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:29,580
I have a lock attack

1227
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:33,020
Speaker okay this

1228
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:41,140
Does that 11 or said I don't remember set 11, I think and you can use the gnome 15

1229
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:49,620
Software to display the same information your talk before so cool you search and all that stuff. I do like that

1230
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:56,660
I do too. Yeah, that's quite cool. You know be the coolest geek project ever and I wish I could remember stuff when I say this

1231
01:32:57,940 --> 01:33:00,180
Would be to have a way to wire out

1232
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:07,220
You ever watch Star Trek Voyager? Absolutely. Okay. Do you remember when they built in a bio-neuter gel pack?

1233
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:15,700
No, do you remember when they built the Delta flyer and they put the the physical toggle switches in there that were like the ones

1234
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:17,700
from their holodeck program and

1235
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:24,900
the captain protons type stuff and it was so it was this 24th century technology that had a

1236
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:32,340
What we would see as touch interface, right? Yeah. Yeah, I had more like a 1920s style physical toggles and stuff like that

1237
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:34,220
I would love to take like

1238
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:38,700
from a like a old old used parts or something where you can get like voltage meters and stuff and

1239
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:43,660
be able to hook those up to an interface on a Linux box that would correspond the

1240
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:50,860
Little needle to CPU usage so I could have physical boxes. Yes with like needles moving the rep represent CPU usage

1241
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:55,940
I think that'd be so cool. Yep. We're like nixie tube spelling out things. Oh god. I'm totally rather

1242
01:33:55,940 --> 01:34:21,460
I actually go nixie tubes because then you can actually change up what it is a little more. Yeah, that'd be really cool
