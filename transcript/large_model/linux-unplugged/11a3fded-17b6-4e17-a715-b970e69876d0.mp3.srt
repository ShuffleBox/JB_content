1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
This is my Geiger counter project I've been working on for about the past year

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:11,000
I decided to build this project as I discovered these cheaply available radiation motor boards on Amazon or Aliexpress and

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,780
Although they like as they stand they give you a nice clicking sound like the recognizable sound you hear on movies and TV

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,440
They don't really do an awful lot

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,040
So I decided to up the ante a bit by connecting this board to a Raspberry Pi

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,720
Feeding the data into influx DB and showing it with Grafana, but then of course it needed a fancy case

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,740
So I set up on this expedition to build a steampunk style

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,840
Geiger counter case

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,160
including

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,360
Like custom machine brass parts LEDs and nixie tubes. Yeah, it is a beautiful case

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,720
The input to the project is of course generated by the radiation detector

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:55,160
this board generates a pulse for every count which is then fed into custom circuitry to drive the LED displays and

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:03,240
Simultaneously into the Raspberry Pi which as he mentioned not only allows the nixie tubes to update which look

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,680
Incredible, but that's also how the data gets into the influx database

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,720
And it's kind of a neat little trick because the Raspberry Pi is locked inside this wooden box behind

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,800
screws and

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,440
Adhesives so there's no getting physically to the pie anymore

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:28,000
Thankfully, you know and this is a show-and-tell over on balena.io so of course the author here is using Balena cloud

19
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:34,560
To handle all the updates they've got a neat sort of framework where it's all still powered on Docker containers now

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,920
They've got their own forked version from from the upstream Moby so that it works well for you know iot embedded use cases

21
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,120
but basically means you can just go you know push some updates to your code push a container to a repository and

22
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:52,160
Then the pie just pulls those updates runs the new container and you don't have to worry about having to go take all the screws

23
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,680
Out pull your thing out to replace the SD card with your updated less broken software

24
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,600
Plus it's all connected with a VPN connection to a public URL so you can get to the dashboard from anywhere

25
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,200
That's my favorite part they might be known for etcher, but they come up with some pretty cool solutions

26
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:21,480
It's worth checking out the link in the show notes

27
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:28,320
Hello friends and welcome into 361 of your weekly Linux talk show my name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Mr.

28
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,160
Payne

29
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,720
361 is packed full of community news our look at the new openSUSE elite 15 to that has been in the works and

30
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,840
Crazy drew got his crazy pebble running rebel, and we'll tell you about that experience

31
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,080
We have an app pick and a lot more so before we go any further. Let's say a hearty

32
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:56,400
Time-appropriate greetings to cheese and drew hello gentlemen hello internet. I'm not crazy. I'm eccentric

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,000
Fair enough, and I agree in a good way in a good way drew because now we get to hear about your experiences with rebel

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
which as a former

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,360
Pebble watch owner which has been a while now

36
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,200
I'm really curious to hear how these old devices which I loved mine had the L cars theme on there curious to hear how it

37
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,680
Holds up and also

38
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,200
We have a duty right here at the top of the show a big shout out to our virtual lug time appropriate greetings

39
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
mobile room

40
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,480
The force is strong in the mumble room some good voices familiar voices new voices. It's great

41
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,680
It's great, and if I'm not mistaken. I think one of those voices is

42
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,400
Jeff who is joining us from an undisclosed location

43
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll say because I actually don't know what it is

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,840
And he has a new project announcement this week Jeff welcome to the show or a big update at least yeah

45
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,160
Thank you for having me. I could say I'm from a bunker in New Zealand, but that wouldn't be the truth I

46
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,640
Like it though. I like it a lot, so Jeff

47
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,440
I grabbed a clip or two of you from a video today

48
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,920
But I guess I didn't need to because you're here, and you have a big release

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,080
This is an app that I think a lot of us could use it's getting things gnome

50
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:17,200
Version 0.4 came out today as we're recording just a little bit ago, and it's a big update

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,560
It's if I'm not mistaken the first update in a long time with 630 new changes

52
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,640
Hundreds of bug fixes it seems like kind of a big milestone

53
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:33,700
Yeah, it is and it's an application that I've been using using since what 2009 so it's been a while

54
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,860
I've just decided to not let this application

55
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,880
Go the way of the dodo because it has gone unmaintained for a while, so I just thought this application is too good

56
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
it's worth saving and

57
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,320
Now I it's basically the last six and a half years of development packed into one release

58
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,080
So pretty significant seems like there's a lot of focus here on improving the contributor experience

59
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,200
You know with some new methodologies some new structure around how the project is gonna

60
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,240
Go so making you hopeful that the next release won't be in another six years

61
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,200
Yeah, because I'm not gonna try to fix everything under the Sun

62
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,800
I mean that part of the

63
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,080
Part of the way you get to release early and often is to try not to fix everything and just fix the most important things

64
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
And then leave all the rest

65
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,480
The that what I call the low-hanging fruit to newcomers to tackle now getting things done

66
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,400
Apps are very popular for those of you that aren't familiar with the getting things done methodology

67
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,720
it's a it's a personal task management system and

68
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,640
I've seen

69
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,120
Hundreds on iOS and Android there's websites dedicated to this

70
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,840
There's entire services and companies like todoist where this is all they do and I'm curious Jeff

71
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,600
What motivates you to make this because it doesn't seem like we're lacking options for commercial offerings

72
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
But maybe we are lacking

73
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,520
Really nice well designed beautifully designed. I should say to do apps for Linux. What's your motivation here?

74
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,080
Obviously, I'm biased. I've been using this thing for over a decade

75
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:15,080
but I do think that getting things gnome has no equivalent on Linux or even arguably on some other platforms and

76
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,240
It's really the I mean, there's maybe one or two other apps including Emacs

77
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,760
That you can use to do GDD on Linux, but it's not the same user experience

78
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,520
It's not, you know built to be not as beautiful as in eye candy

79
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,200
But beautiful in terms of efficiency and terms of workflow

80
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:42,760
So it has a bunch of little details, you know attention to detail that make it a wholly different thing from your regular to-do list

81
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:48,480
And someone might say why are you obsessing about something? That's basically a to-do list. But that thing is

82
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,960
You know, it's really easy to make

83
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:58,680
Grocery shopping list to-do list application. That's basically computer science 101. You hack that in two hours

84
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:07,000
But making something that is really well integrated and smart and that has all the crazy features that you need to

85
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,600
Do something as advanced as to getting things done methodology or some of the other

86
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,600
Methodologies out there is quite a different ballpark

87
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:24,840
Yes, it is and you touched on something there that I think is really important for a personal life management app like this

88
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,800
And you said I've been using this for 10 years

89
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,480
Can you talk a little bit about how an app like this needs to be around for a very long time?

90
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:38,360
And that's why it's kind of risky to go with something like to-do list or a commercial application in this regard

91
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,640
That's part of the reason why I've stubbornly refused to let this app go

92
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,760
completely on maintains is I

93
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,540
Basically invested my life and my my productivity

94
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,960
And I centered everything around this app. Wow

95
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,040
And so you don't really migrate that easily to another app for one thing

96
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,400
You would need other apps to understand the file format and that sort of thing

97
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:11,480
Those apps usually aren't built to interoperate, you know, especially in the commercial world. Well, they don't really care to

98
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,480
Interoperate I I refuse the notion of

99
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
just going out there and paying like a

100
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,880
30 bucks to buy a proprietary application that I I'm not sure will still exist in five years

101
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:30,920
Whenever the company gets bought out by another company or when they change their terms and condition or they decide to

102
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,280
Stop supporting my platform. That's one of the risks you have with proprietary software

103
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,320
Especially software that you really depend on for your daily life work and play

104
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:47,640
Is to depend on a system that might not exist next year. Yes. Well put

105
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,720
Yeah, and of course if you switch, I mean all the time spent switching is time wasted

106
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,400
All the time spent switching is time spent not getting things done

107
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,840
Arguably that's also a disease that many gtd practitioners have we have this shiny widget syndrome thing where we

108
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Want to try yet another tool

109
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:11,560
Um and yet another to do app. Oh and this one promises to be just as more amazing than the previous one

110
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,720
And you spend more time

111
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,840
Playing with the tools than actually using them and this tool. Well, I mean it's good enough it works

112
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,760
So I haven't changed it and I don't want to change it. I just wanted to improve it

113
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,400
I'm curious about the experience of bringing it up to a modern

114
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,880
Gnome application because it it kind of almost looks like an example modern

115
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,640
Gnome desktop app

116
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,800
It's got a lot of the bells and whistles that you see in there and i'm curious

117
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,680
What that process was like to just modernize it. I can't speak for isidor and the other people

118
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,960
Who spent a couple years burning out doing the actual port to gtk 3?

119
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:53,320
Uh, I just came in and finished the job kind of um by just kind of focusing the project towards a singular goal

120
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
or getting the release out and

121
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,160
managing the project properly

122
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,520
But it's more of a technological problem and a problem of risking burnout

123
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,320
Than a design problem

124
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:12,200
It's kind of special in the way that getting things gnome was kind of so well designed from the get-go

125
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,680
That it was almost a gnome 3 app already in terms of how the ui behaved and everything

126
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:27,880
Of course, you need to change the code base port to python 3 from python 2 and to integrate things like the gtk header bar widget

127
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,200
To have a nice cleaner ui that is now possible. It was not possible 10 years ago

128
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,720
but the whole design processing that was not the hardest thing the hardest thing is

129
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Getting things gnome done

130
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,800
And getting it out of the door and like so many free software projects

131
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,880
It stands on the work of those who came before you to get some of that work done to get moved over to gtk3

132
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, congratulations on the new release

133
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,440
We'll have a link to uh the project page and also the flat hub entry if people want to get the flat pack of it

134
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,720
If you're out there looking for a native local

135
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,880
Task management application either for a beginner or somebody who's fairly advanced

136
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,600
I give this a big hearty recommendation jeff. Thanks for making it on the show and telling us a little bit about it

137
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
My pleasure. Thanks for having me

138
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,360
Let's talk about the crazy cats over at fedora now who are just

139
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,720
Working up a whole bunch of stuff for fedora 33 including the end of mod php

140
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,960
and perhaps

141
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,160
more

142
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:36,840
Interesting to us is no more swap partition fedora normally installs itself with a modest swap partition to take some pressure off

143
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:44,040
Memory if needed, but a new proposal says to do away with the swap file and instead use a virtual swap device using

144
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:51,080
Zram the zram device works by compressing memory contents and then storing them back in memory when needed and then retrieving them and

145
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:57,960
Obviously decompressing when you're compressing and decompressing the ram it's super fast and swapping the zram can

146
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,160
Potentially free up considerable space from a swap file or a swap partition if it's not needed

147
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,360
Yeah, and surprisingly maybe zram is often faster than swapping to a storage device

148
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,520
Even though the cpu has to do the work of compression and decompression, but that's just really fast with modern cpus

149
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,760
Yeah, that'd be interesting to see if that takes off

150
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,560
I could see it especially since I think fedora workstation is really targeted at a lot of laptop users with

151
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,600
Limited ssds. There's also some stuff being considered at the lower levels of fedora

152
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Yeah, some interesting potential changes on compiler policies now long-standing fedora policies are

153
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,260
Fedora policy as it is now says that the entire distribution has to be built with gcc

154
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:45,160
With exceptions only for packages that cannot be built with gcc, but the plan for fedora 33 is to get rid of that requirement

155
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,120
Instead the compiler used for any given package would be the one preferred by upstream

156
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,480
Well, assuming that upstream has expressed a preference, of course

157
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,640
That would open the way for building a number of llvm preferring packages

158
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:03,560
Without maintainers having to struggle to get a working build with gcc and that seems pretty great if you want to you know

159
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,880
Maintain good relationships with upstream, especially if you've already been building with llvm and here you go

160
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,720
Just some downstream, you know distro says oh no if you want your package here

161
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,120
You got to use an entirely different tool chain

162
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,320
Yeah, I hadn't really thought about that problem before lwn.net has some great coverage of the reactions, too

163
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,200
Which we'll have linked in the show notes if you'd like to grab that

164
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:29,500
Jeff law is driving this change and he said using the upstream preferred compiler would make life easier for fedora package maintainers

165
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,540
Some of these proposals have strong reactions

166
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:40,120
But the one that I think has probably gotten the most strongest reaction is that crazy cat neil who's in the mumble room right now

167
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:46,360
Has proposed that fedora change the default file system for fedora workstation to butter fs

168
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,360
And i'd say it's seen the whole gamut of responses neil

169
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,880
Ha ha ha you're here. Yeah. Yes. Yes

170
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,560
You sound tired you sound tired it showed up on devil on a friday

171
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:06,540
And thank goodness. I I had the day off that friday. And so that friday saturday sunday

172
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
monday and tuesday

173
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,800
I was responding to things basically almost every other email and pouring over it and trying to figure out

174
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:22,840
You know what's going on and the feedback the good news is that it's generally been very balanced. It was very the the fedora community

175
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,400
Took it seriously and responded with really useful feedback that helped us

176
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,960
Tune and refine the the proposal and also I want to point out that this is not just workstation

177
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,120
Every fedora desktop flavor is switching

178
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,880
The only variants not switching right now are fedora server and fedora cloud

179
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,560
Those two variants are remaining with their current setup, which is for cloud

180
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:54,440
I think it's just a single big x4 volume and for server. It's xfs on lvm

181
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,080
And fedora core os also has its like

182
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,840
Strange

183
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:06,360
X4 based thing, but yeah, that's the change that's just because it reflects the intentions of rel not to make a switch to butter fs

184
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah, it's it's that but also um

185
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,120
One of the primary motivating factors for changing to butter fs is that there's this space contention thing

186
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,320
I know you talked about this on air a few weeks ago

187
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,880
The space contention thing is essentially the biggest driver for this

188
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,960
the next driver for using butter fs over alternatives is that

189
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,000
Anaconda the red hat fedora installer

190
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,860
Has special behavior when it comes to butter fs sub volumes if you wish to reinstall

191
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:41,980
And you have home as a separate sub volume. It will not make you blow it away because it will just make a new

192
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:49,900
root sub volume or erase the existing one and then remount the new one that you make and you can reuse the existing roots of

193
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,580
Home sub volume and that lets you preserve your data as you reinstall so you get to have your cake and eat it too

194
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:02,300
Access to all the space while also being able to reliably preserve data across reinstalls, which can happen

195
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,880
There are for various reasons people may want to reinstall. Maybe they want to switch desktop environments

196
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,220
They want to change some settings or whatever

197
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:16,780
So like this is about making sure that that's still possible because every other alternative blocks that now on the other hand

198
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,480
There has been some pushback and I think there's also a lot of folks still who are uncomfortable

199
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:26,380
Around the idea of butter fs. They consider it unsafe, but I remember a time

200
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:31,740
When the newer versions of the extended file system like three and four were considered a mess

201
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,860
I remember a time when riser fs was a mess

202
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:40,540
I remember a time when a lot of file systems were rough and they got better as development continued

203
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,060
The file systems that didn't get better just didn't have active development

204
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:50,140
And I think the big difference back then was is we didn't have all of these platforms to amplify the problems

205
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:54,380
You didn't have social media reddit and podcasts and youtube videos that were

206
00:16:54,380 --> 00:17:01,420
Just amplifying the issues you were just a person in a data center dealing with data loss by yourself

207
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,220
Maybe bitching on a form or a bbs and it was essentially contained

208
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:11,260
But now there's an amplification chamber where people who don't really know the cause of the problems

209
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:17,420
I it seems like if you go by the data a lot of file system issues that butter fs run into today

210
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,780
Are actually caused by crappy firmware on disks

211
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,060
And this is something that's bared out at facebook as well about

212
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,860
five six years ago

213
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,500
Facebook started seriously ramping up towards the next generation storage architecture

214
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,700
And they hired on developers to work on butter fs as their select as their choice for this

215
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
And they've discovered over time

216
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,500
That basically things that people expected it to be butter fs's fault

217
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:50,540
Wound up being stupid things like the storage controller just can't handle massive. Io load and started rejecting drives

218
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,660
Or the ssd just like chokes out because like it just does the wrong thing

219
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,980
And the problem is that butter fs is sensitive to those things other file systems are not

220
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:07,180
And you know people do things like well, let's intentionally punch holes through the file system and see if butter fs can recover

221
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,100
The problem with that strategy when you compare it against the old system

222
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:17,980
The problem with that strategy when you compare it against xfs and x4 is that when you do that?

223
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,180
The way that fisk works is that it attempts to repair the mountability of the file system

224
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,740
It tries to restore the integrity of the metadata at all costs

225
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,340
This means that you could entirely have the possibility

226
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,700
Of restoring an x4 xfs file system where the links to the data

227
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,540
Are fine, but the data itself is bad, right? And it just continues on as if nothing's wrong

228
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,220
Exactly and in butter fs's case

229
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:48,380
And of course you and I both are aware like we've talked about zfs before zfs also does this if you repair the file system

230
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:53,020
And it does a validation of the data as part of relinking the metadata to the data

231
00:18:53,420 --> 00:19:00,460
And it it discovers that the data is broken. It will loudly tell you so and it will say you've lost data

232
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,700
Good luck. Have fun

233
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:09,900
My final thoughts on this because I know we've talked about it a lot is essentially in the ven diagram of when to adopt

234
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,860
Open source or free software. I think butter fs is now sitting in the sweet middle

235
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,860
It needs more deployments

236
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:23,580
But it has now been tested not only in scale with lots of nas products that ship with butter fs

237
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:29,820
And obviously at facebook that gets mentioned all the time, but also as the default file system on opensusa for years

238
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:37,100
So we've had a lot of production testing and now we could bring it to even more masses and the reality is fedora and redhat

239
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,220
They're never going to ship zfs as the default file system, but they need a competitive product

240
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,760
They need something that competes with modern ntfs and apfs

241
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,380
Things like snapshot based backups and windows shadow copies

242
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:55,260
Have been commonplace in the commercial operating systems for a while now

243
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:01,580
And we will never even get to the point of starting to build those features into things like our desktop environments and our file managers

244
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:07,740
Or even user land tools until it's shipped developers need the code shipping to use it and there's things

245
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,700
We need to work out too on how to properly ship all the updates and all of that that will only happen

246
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,940
When we start to do it at scale

247
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:21,180
And it seems to me that if you were to review the landscape of possible linux distributions that this could happen in

248
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,740
Fedora is an obvious case

249
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:30,060
My old butt remembers a time when fedora was so cutting edge that they adopted pulse audio before everybody else

250
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:35,260
And they shipped a volume applet in the gnome menu bar that didn't actually change the volume

251
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,380
But they plan to make that work in the next release

252
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,760
And it was important to get pulse audio out in front of end users and make it reliable

253
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,220
and fedora could bring butterfs to a whole new scale of users and

254
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:55,900
The ideal fedora user from a project standpoint is a sysadmin devops developer type person who's using a laptop

255
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:02,400
With an ssd in it. That's probably 512 gigs or less and that is such a perfect use case for butterfs

256
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,380
additionally

257
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:10,460
features like encryption are coming down the pipeline that already use the same mature data pipeline that

258
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:16,860
Compression uses on butterfs which means it's going to be a solid crypto using a solid proven data pathway

259
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:23,020
To make it happen and you'll be able to encrypt a single file a single folder or encrypt an existing

260
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:28,220
Mount point without having to wipe the data and set it up again and that

261
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:36,380
Single limitation that exists now in linux has forced vendors like system 76 to create installer

262
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,780
Methodologies that wipe and reload your system after you receive it

263
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:46,380
Which if you think about it is mental that they have to do that because it just enters so many

264
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,540
Possibility of mistakes and errors where it could leave the user with an unusable system

265
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,780
So they have to test the hell out of it

266
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,220
To just work around this problem where they can't encrypt a mount point or a home folder that already exists

267
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,700
So they can't ship you a system that's set up and ready to go

268
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,420
They have to do that work and that's crazy

269
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:09,260
And it seems like something from the 90s and linux should be a bastion of technical excellence

270
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,300
And we have a file system here. That is gpl. It's free software

271
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,380
It's completely cool and okay to link it to the kernel

272
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,620
And we're just sitting on our hands going. I don't know. I've heard some bad stuff about it

273
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,740
Meanwhile, people are putting in production going actually it's gotten a lot better

274
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,140
Last but not least even though I said, I know it was almost done. But now i'm going on a roll

275
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:37,740
I was a big critic. I said it was junk and I was willing to revisit that and try it in production again

276
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:43,020
I even was willing to revisit it after I blew away data because I realized it wasn't butterfess's fault

277
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,020
It was my fault. I screwed it up

278
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,140
I even I will now eat my words and say, you know what? It's gotten better

279
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,180
Maybe it was crap when I tried it and my systems wouldn't boot in the past

280
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,940
But now here I am using it and it's been working fantastic for me

281
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:01,340
And I just have to implore people to just give it another look because the reality about free software

282
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,940
And this is something that's great is that as long as development continues

283
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:10,140
It's always improving and if you haven't checked in lately, then maybe your opinion's out of date and

284
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,620
I'm not saying it's forever use case

285
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:19,340
But the developer workstation with a 256 gigabyte ssd in their laptop. I think it's probably the ideal case

286
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:26,940
End of soapbox, but I would love to see it happen in fedora 33 and i'm curious neil in your personal opinion

287
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
How close is that actually to happening?

288
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,420
I mean is this is this getting dangled in front of me and it's going to be yanked away

289
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:39,580
I sure hope not. I mean like man i've been working on this personally for a little over three years

290
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,940
Like I i've been doing integration at almost every layer of the stack for a few years now, and it's just

291
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,460
Nobody more than me would be sad if I had to feet from the jaws of victory here

292
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:57,020
I have no reason to expect it to not be approved and that we would not start going forward with this

293
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,340
Within the next day or so

294
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,540
Basically once it's approved formally by fesco fedora engineering steering committee

295
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,380
Then uh, we will go forward with starting to implement all this

296
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:15,820
and like I have in my mind a mental road map of ideas of things that we can do to start leveraging these things as we

297
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:23,680
Validate and test these features and integrate them into our user experience. I'm going through this actually fairly conservatively

298
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,980
There are many things that I am personally using that i'm not even including in this change proposal because I want to make sure

299
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:35,340
That we have this rock solid as we go forward and adopt features. That makes sense

300
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,700
It's no fun to be the guy who has to say well, i'm sorry

301
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,460
Like your data's gone because like you messed up here. It's neil's fault

302
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,460
He got everybody to use butter fs and you lost your data because of neil. Yeah, no, no

303
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,980
The reason why i'm excited for it is

304
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,780
I like to see this stuff happen

305
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:58,780
I like to be on the front lines and watch it and then hopefully see developers begin to integrate it and that just won't happen

306
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,740
Because today I could install fedora and I could choose butter fs or xfs and I have

307
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,940
And it's fine, but it's basically as functional as any other file system. There's nothing

308
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:15,580
Integrated with the operating system. There's no real advantage to it. Um, it's just disconnected

309
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,700
It's disjointed and we can begin to bring that together

310
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:24,460
If we start to deploy this default and still leave all the other file systems available for people to select you could oh you could

311
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,780
You could put extended 2 on there for all I care

312
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,340
So i'll keep an eye on it neil. Hopefully we'll see it developed now. We are going to be off next week

313
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,460
So if it does happen, uh, I mean we're pre-recorded is what I should say because we never really take a week off

314
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:41,020
It's the steady beat of lup, but uh, if it does happen, we'll have to cover it in two weeks

315
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,420
Should be interesting

316
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:48,220
Um, and then actually you know what if it does happen, uh, we'll be talking about it in the lup lug

317
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,240
So why don't we right here? This is probably the best time to do a little housekeeping

318
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,340
So the lup lug happens every sunday at new york time

319
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:04,700
It happens every sunday at noon pacific the regular broadcast time in our mumble room up in the lobby

320
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,260
I encourage you to join it now. I mention the mumble all the time and I want to let you know how to find it

321
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,460
I should probably put it on the main linux unplugged website

322
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,900
Never crossed my mind wouldn't that be an idea?

323
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,620
You know, I guess we just been around a long time west

324
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,180
We never thought about it because the traditional way is you just go google search jupiter colony mumble

325
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,780
And the setup guide is there you can follow that and

326
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,940
And get it set up in a few minutes, but I think we probably should have something on the main site

327
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,740
So we'll probably do that eventually go google search mumble jupiter colony and you'll find it in there

328
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,220
You'll find the guide get it all set up and then join us on a sunday

329
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,380
And chat with us and be part of a lug. We have 30 folks in here right now

330
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:48,300
If you think about that in terms of people showing up for a lug meeting, that's a really great attendance

331
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,620
Usually on sundays we usually have around 20

332
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,940
And we're just chatting about all kinds of stuff

333
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:58,460
So yeah, like I mentioned, we won't be live next tuesday, but the lug lug continues every single sunday

334
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,820
And then the live show will be back on the 21st of july

335
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,760
2020 obviously if you're listening to this in the future i'm going on a little family trip to montana

336
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,540
And then linux headlines will also be off

337
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:17,500
Back on the 20th because drew's taking a little time off too. That's great. Huh? It's about time. We're finally letting him

338
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:22,540
Finally, I mean i'm gonna make him set up cameras and wear a tracker obviously

339
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,860
But we're gonna let him take a little time off and then you can always check the calendar

340
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,380
Yeah, put that put that tracker back on drew this ankle monitor is giving me a rash dude

341
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:38,880
Yeah, yeah, that's what my kids and wife complain about too. Uh, you can know when we're live at jupiter broadcasting.com

342
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,180
Calendar, hopefully we just keep that updated and it's all over there and then you don't have to worry about it

343
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:47,280
So there you have it. That's it. That's all I got for you in the housekeeping

344
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:56,620
Nice and tidy around here west doesn't take very long. This is my last uh, my last podcast

345
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:03,980
Total into from texas. You sound a little sentimental about that. I am i've i've liked my i've enjoyed my time down here

346
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,460
It's so much nicer to drive down here

347
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,860
They've got like side highways west that go along the main highway and then they've got frontage roads

348
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:16,540
And then they've got toll roads and uh, so you can just zip around here. You just zip. I mean i'm in

349
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,100
austin and it's still

350
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,500
Better traffic than you get 50 miles north of seattle. So I will miss that

351
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:29,660
I won't miss the heat though. The feels like temperature is 108 degrees fahrenheit today. So I won't I won't miss that

352
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,020
Um, all right. Well, let's talk about open susa leap

353
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,780
15.2 a new leap is upon us

354
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:43,100
Speaking of uh butter fs based systems. I have not tried out susa in about

355
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:50,940
275 years so I thought why not give it a go and immediately install the server version which i'll talk about

356
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,660
in a little bit, but uh sus has

357
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,580
leaped again

358
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,740
I don't really know what to say about sus because to me it's this linux distribution

359
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:05,580
that I try for a little bit and then I end up usually going back to other distros just because

360
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,820
I've never really just gotten in the groove but 15.2 contains a lot of nice stuff

361
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:15,020
The shipping sway for wayland, which as you know is a drop-in replacement for the i3 window manager

362
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:20,300
they're also including a real-time kernel for some folks that need that like uh

363
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:26,300
Embedded devices or audio pros or if you're capturing a lot of data real-time can be

364
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,220
Very important. It's just nice to see this going in another distribution

365
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:36,140
Of course yas has gotten some improvements as always and the other thing that's interesting about leap is they're

366
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:41,100
Continuing to support a migration strategy to go from open susa leap

367
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,860
To susa linux enterprise their commercial product

368
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:50,060
Which I suppose probably happens. Well, right. I mean, you know, you maybe you're testing it out

369
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:55,340
Maybe you're considering switching or you just you know, you build out your prototype down the road your business does well and you realize

370
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,540
Oh, you know, we we really we can afford support now. We need support now

371
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,740
And you don't have to re-architect stuff. You should just you know, switch on over. Yeah

372
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,660
It's just all those people are using ubuntu. Well, there is that but maybe you're in germany

373
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:11,820
Yeah, I suppose it's just you know in the ubuntu model and I don't mean to to to to harsh on susa's vibe here

374
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,660
But in the ubuntu model, it's just one ubuntu. You just go get the lts

375
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:23,180
There's no silly different versions. It feels like a windows thing to do this. Yeah, or I mean it is definitely an older style

376
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,460
I guess right

377
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:29,820
Not as not a hyper converged, which is okay. I mean that still works for a lot of people. But yeah, I could see it

378
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,940
I could see it being a possibility of try before you buy sort of thing

379
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:38,700
So let's go around the horn and see what you all thought cheesy. Let's start with you. Why don't we do a

380
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:44,140
You know the old say what you didn't like and then end on what you did like and so i'm gonna look at this as kind

381
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:50,560
Of a new user perspective this perspective. I generally like to give someone that that hasn't used a lot of linux distributions

382
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,920
And susa's one of those that's kind of like you said kind of on the outskirts a little bit that a lot of people may not have

383
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,880
Um yas

384
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,880
While cool is still yas

385
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:08,080
Um and feels a little nostalgic to me. The the installation was a little awkward. I didn't get you know, um,

386
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
Like a simple partitioning

387
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:15,040
Method, uh, it did select the disk that was empty by default

388
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:20,560
So it was smart enough to know that this disc didn't have any other file systems on it. Um, use that disk

389
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,120
There were also some other little features in the installer which kind of annoyed me. They had uh green buttons with gray text on them

390
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,840
Why would you ever do that? It's a horrible idea

391
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:34,320
Please don't because I didn't know when to click next was it done? Was it supposed to light up?

392
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,440
You know black over the green button whenever it was done. I didn't know so that was a little awkward

393
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,400
But I mean installation was pretty straightforward. No big deal there

394
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:48,720
The default installation and version of grub recognized my popos install on another disc

395
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,000
And was fine. I was able to you know switch into either one

396
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,560
however, after I

397
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,040
Updated it for the first time it removed that entry from grub

398
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,240
So, you know not a big deal something I can get through but you know

399
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,360
If you are a user that's trying out multiple distributions on a system with multiple hard drives that might be

400
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,480
Something you come across and then after the first update as well auto login was turned on by default

401
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,520
Yeah, I think it is in the installer too. I think during the installation. Why would you that's no

402
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,080
Well, you know, I I think there are

403
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,040
By far and large my use case is you know the system i'm setting up at home where yeah

404
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,640
I never turned that on but

405
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,200
I imagine for a lot of people it doesn't make sense to have to log in if you have one compute user on the account

406
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
And you keep your computer in your house

407
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,120
Especially right now. That's true. But I mean, I I think it's always good practice to have a login

408
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,040
The thing that's annoying about that is then you just have to unlock the keychain anyways, you know

409
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,320
Like kd wallet or gnome keychain still has to be unlocked when you auto log in and so you end up just having to put your

410
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,360
Password in anyways, right? Right. They also use a little bit older version of gnome

411
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:02,560
Which was good because the the problem I'd had with folders in gnome 3.6 is that you have to have a keychain

412
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,040
I'd had with folders in gnome 3.6 isn't there because they're using gnome 3.4

413
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,520
That does use the 5.3 kernel

414
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,400
And then another thing that was just really kind of awkward to me. I've seen other distributions do this

415
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,520
There were two terminal applications

416
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,000
There were two mail applications by default. So there seemed like a lot of

417
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,240
Stuff they could have cleaned up. Yeah, it's just an old way of doing it, huh?

418
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,520
Yeah, well and it's you know, they just auto populate the the menus and and that's what you get, right?

419
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,480
So, I mean, I I like that it's

420
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,360
Installed by default like having mutt there is cool. But if you're going to do that does mutt really need

421
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,280
An icon in your application menu if you're just going to open up the terminal and open mutt that way

422
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,560
So it seems a little weird in that regard

423
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:58,080
You know, I would have personally cleaned up a few of the apps and made that selection a little a little better for the end user

424
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,360
But on the good side, I mean it did seem pretty snappy. I know i'm the only person in the world

425
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,280
That's a fan of hot corners, but they were turned on by default, which I thought was cool

426
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,360
The offline installer was super cool. Yeah, I do like that

427
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:18,960
It threw me back into a little bit of nostalgia right with yas an offline installer. Everything's there on you know, the 4.6 gigabyte

428
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,320
Uh iso reading the release notes as files install

429
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,360
Right, you know, so I mean it was cool. It was cool

430
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,920
And then the the overall selection of default apps were pretty solid apps

431
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,960
I mean they weren't bad, but there were some redundant apps, which is kind of weird but

432
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,640
Overall, I mean, I think it's a good distro. Is it something that i'm going to use

433
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,040
On the day-to-day, you know, probably not at least not right now

434
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,520
But I will review it again in the future as I mean it was the very first

435
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,600
User-friendly distro that I ever ever used. I think I pretty much am right in line with your observations there

436
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:58,320
It feels almost like a a different branch where there were trying things out and some things have stuck that didn't stick in

437
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,080
The other branch of linux and some things should be adopted that haven't been adopted by the other branch of linux

438
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,120
Wes i'm curious your thoughts on this guy. Um, I think in my opinion

439
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,800
The installer manages to strike that balance of easy to use for the most part

440
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:21,280
But gives power users a lot of options and perhaps I think it gets there a little better than anaconda does for fedora

441
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:27,600
You know, honestly, I was really impressed with the installer. It's been ages since i've installed open susa

442
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,520
And yeah, you know, um parts especially during the actual installation

443
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,080
It was a little bit slow for me now full disclosure

444
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,720
I was installing in a virtual machine and then rebooted, you know into the real os afterwards

445
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,760
That might have just been my own internet or you know, whatever mirrors I happened to be using at the time

446
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,280
But the rest of the installation experience really I couldn't have been happier with and I was really impressed at the end

447
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,040
Especially you just got this really detailed rundown of all the options

448
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,560
You've configured and then little clickable links if you need to go adjust that

449
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,000
One that really stood out to me was let's say you want to change, you know

450
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,840
If you're enabling or disabling specter mitigations, you just click on that

451
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,960
Pops you up to where you can go make adjustments to whatever grub parameters are going to get set for your kernel command line

452
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,720
Right there in the installer and I don't see that hardly anywhere else

453
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,520
Yeah, it really felt like it was at home in the enterprise

454
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,760
But it didn't make you go through those things if you're just a normal user and you know

455
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,280
You don't even know what that means

456
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,840
I do agree with you that anything to do with package management feels like your soul dies a little bit

457
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,080
I I just wince when I click on the online updates and it does like the four or five

458
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:40,160
Prerequisite things that it has to do before it can even execute the very task that i've asked for and it's just

459
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:47,040
Compared to every other package manager on the entire planet that just immediately gets to work when you tell it to do an update

460
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,800
I find that just soul crushing the transactional server option was interesting

461
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:59,280
So this is an installer mode you can now select and one of the key features is a read-only root file system

462
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,640
You kind of need that if you're going to go with the whole transactional style, right?

463
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,520
And we've all had especially thinking of upgrades over in the debian world with apt where

464
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,600
Something breaks or maybe it's on arch and suddenly you just you can't change your packages

465
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,640
You don't know what to do and you just wish you could roll that back and try it again later, right?

466
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,320
And if you enable this transactional server support, that's what it does

467
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,400
It comes with a read-only file system

468
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:29,600
And then when you install stuff it all goes in a brand new snapshot and only if that installation to the snapshot volume goes well

469
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,400
Do you actually go reboot into the new system?

470
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,040
One thing that's different too, you know compared to things like um, like os tree or some of the core os style

471
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,040
You know, there's been a lot of different takes on this idea, but in the open suse land

472
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,920
It's all powered by the same zipper and butter fs

473
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,760
So you don't have to rebuild your packages to support this new transactional style. You just basically get it for free

474
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,240
There's a good example of a distribution that is starting to leverage

475
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,360
The built-in capabilities of butter fs instead of having to create that code themselves from scratch

476
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,720
And it's just an aspect of maturity of shipping butter fs for a while

477
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,040
These things are just now commonly available to them and they can integrate them more and more

478
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,600
And I I think that was a key point I was trying to make earlier with the fedora adoption is they have to adopt it

479
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,120
Now in order for features like this to come along down the road. This is pretty neat stuff here

480
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,440
Yeah, the other stuff I thought was really kind of neat is um, there's a transactional shell feature

481
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,720
So if you'd like after that installation installs into this new snapshot

482
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,360
You can get a shell, you know, basically a cheroot into that environment

483
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,240
If you want to go test some things out make sure your package is installed correctly tweak any of the configuration before you reboot

484
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,360
And I think another sign of maturity. There's a built-in health checker framework

485
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,080
So after you've rebooted into the new server the health checker runs and verifies the state of the system

486
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,320
So you make sure that all the services you need are running make sure that the database you installed starts up

487
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,640
Okay, and it's just a bunch of shell scripts

488
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,560
So it's easy to extend if you know, you're using this to build your own custom application

489
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,000
You can include your own logic there to make sure that your custom app starts up

490
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,600
Okay, and if not, the system automatically rolls back to the previous snapshots and reboots, so you're done

491
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,840
that is

492
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,840
So what i'm talking about

493
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:14,080
That is really a really nice setup and like you said it just seems like a mature way to do it

494
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,000
It's enterprise grade. Exactly. So check out leap

495
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,240
It's a pretty solid option. And if you're not an old grump like me

496
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,240
Who's stuck in his ways?

497
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,760
It may be a great opportunity to try something that has a lot of unique features and capabilities to it

498
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,880
I think it's something kind of special in the linux world and we don't talk about a lot because none of us are susa users

499
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,680
But i'd love to hear your experiences with it

500
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:43,200
If you have tried out 15.2 go to linux unplugged dot com slash contact

501
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,320
And write in and let me know how it's gone for you. I think it's uh, it's an opportunity to kind of

502
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,880
Crowdsource

503
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,680
People's results, you know, it is kind of it's been something of a blind spot for us, I guess

504
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,360
Um, and there's really a lot of interesting stuff there. That's that's happening

505
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,920
Especially around yast and the butter fs adoptions

506
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,640
A lot of good ideas and I think we could do a little better job of highlighting that and that's something the audience could

507
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,300
Really help us with linux unplugged dot com slash contact. Okay, so on december 7th

508
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:18,580
2016 it feels like it was just yesterday pebble announced they were ceasing operations

509
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,620
Two days later on december 9th 2016

510
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:28,740
The rebel site went live and our very own rebel. Mr. Drew has brought his pebble back to life

511
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,860
Such a rude. Tell me about this process and this experience. It's something i've always wanted to try

512
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,660
Were you still actively using the pebble?

513
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:42,820
Did you have to dig it out of the drawer and it just happened to still work the very first step was remembering which

514
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,980
Bucket I had put it in and finding out that it was working

515
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,980
Put it in and finding it

516
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,940
The second step was finding the charging cable

517
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:59,380
Which was not right there with it because I just am terrible at sorting old junk that i've tossed in a drawer

518
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,540
And it's got a weird charger too. Yeah, it's got the little pogo pins and all that

519
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,980
but once I found it it charged right up and

520
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:13,060
The process to install is a little involved, but it's not terrible

521
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:20,180
The instructions on the rebel website are pretty clear and they're separated out for if you're on ios or android

522
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:27,460
And me being on android the number one thing that you have to do is you have to go and get the old pebble app

523
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,860
Which is not on the play store anymore. You've got to download it from apk mirror

524
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,460
And once you do that and kind of get everything connected

525
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,260
Then it's really simple. You just have to go to two websites

526
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,900
two websites and in the back end the pebble app will switch

527
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:51,780
From the pebble web services over to the rebel web services and you're off and running. How does that switch happen?

528
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:56,820
You literally just go to auth dot rebel dot i o in a browser

529
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,380
and sign in

530
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:03,940
And then after that you go to boot dot rebel dot i o it'll reopen the pebble app

531
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:09,700
And you'll be greeted with the rebel login screen instead of the pebble login screen. That's it

532
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:14,660
Wow, is it using some sort of software update function to do that? That's pretty simple. That's nice

533
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:19,300
I don't know how it works in the back end because when I was reading the instructions

534
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:24,180
It's like clearly there has to be something more to this than just clicking two links

535
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,940
This doesn't make sense to me to my my little brain

536
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,580
how does it um, you know make that switch within the app itself, but

537
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,460
it does and

538
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:41,220
Once you're in you can download old and new watch faces and old and new apps

539
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:47,940
Pretty simple pretty slick and it works just the way that you remember back when it was the official pebble stuff. That's pretty great now

540
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:53,780
Simpler than you were expecting it sounds like oh, yeah much much much simpler than I expected

541
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,780
I thought I was gonna have to be like

542
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:02,020
Doing some adb stuff or something along those lines. No, not at all. Are they hosting these services?

543
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:06,580
Yeah, they are and the rebel web services are basically a drop-in replacement

544
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:13,940
It's all hosted on their end and they do have a premium tier where you can pay 33 bucks a year or three bucks a month

545
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,300
And that'll give you dictation and weather services

546
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:24,100
But other than that the main reason to do it is just to support the rebel project so that they can keep their servers online

547
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,460
So once you got this thing up and going were you able to do anything cool?

548
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:32,900
I did try to get the old home assistant app up and running now that i'm a home assistant user

549
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:37,780
but unfortunately the app was not authenticating properly for me, but

550
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:43,880
I found another app called HTTP push that allows me to put in custom HTTP

551
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,580
you know get or

552
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,100
push requests

553
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:55,540
And I set up some webhook automations in my home assistant. And so now on my watch I can launch services

554
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,540
I can toggle lights

555
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:02,020
I can even set it up so that it will broadcast to my google homes

556
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:06,900
And let my wife know that i'm on my way home if i'm out picking something up neat

557
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,540
Very modern and all the old health features and everything still work

558
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:17,140
You know, it still even ties into google fit which I really like and I think my number one feature

559
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,860
The thing that I missed most of all is the smart alarm

560
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,900
Where it will track my sleep and figure out when i'm not in REM sleep

561
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:31,300
And that's when it starts vibrating on my wrist to wake me up. That makes all the difference. Oh, I missed it so much

562
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:37,300
It was so good. Yeah, you know, I just did this yesterday and I used that smart alarm feature last night

563
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,380
And I woke up feeling better than I had in quite a while

564
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:47,620
Is the integration pretty good with your phone OS like music controls or podcast controls work? Okay and stuff. Oh, yeah, totally

565
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:51,220
Huh, I gave my pebble to my dad

566
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,580
Uh, and he still uses it and I don't know if he did this or not

567
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:59,700
He may have he's he's just technical enough and it sounds like the process wouldn't be too difficult

568
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:04,100
Does it integrate in with calendar services and stuff like that as well? Absolutely

569
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,500
And they show up on your timeline just like they used to

570
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:14,260
And the rebel people recently set it up so that you can push other things to a separate timeline and it'll come down to your watch

571
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:19,220
So you can do things like set up, um, you know if this and that integrations to

572
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,260
Have like rss feeds and things pop up in your timeline

573
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:29,700
Which you couldn't do before because that was tied in with the old pebble service, but now they've uh, stripped it out and uh,

574
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:36,660
Polished it up and made it fresh again. So you're gonna keep using it. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, really? Yeah, totally

575
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:40,660
Oh cool. How's the battery? Is it still hanging in there? Yeah, it's doing great

576
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:46,900
It's as good as I remember it being you know, like eight days of battery life on the model that I have and it's

577
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,260
you know, it's only been a day, but it's uh sitting at

578
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:56,260
Like 90 to 100 percent. So oh man. I wish something would have come from this

579
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:01,540
Line of technology because it just makes so much sense to use an e-ink display

580
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,620
On a watch and when you say eight days of battery life

581
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,820
My mouth drops open because i've you know, i've had several newer watches

582
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:17,620
Digital watches and they get a day maybe two days if i'm lucky. I'm curious drew if you're now going to uh,

583
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:23,700
Look around at the the old round and the steel and the other series because you should be able to get those for

584
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,300
A ridiculous amount of money nowadays. I mean, they should be pretty cheap

585
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:32,820
I loaded rebel a long time ago probably in 2016 or something like that on my old pebble, but

586
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:37,780
I've since put it away and it was okay then but it sounds like it's worth a revision

587
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:42,660
Yeah, I remember they were really cheap right when the service had just you know

588
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,660
Been announced that it was going away

589
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:50,260
And they were getting rid of like the old stock and the used market is not as cheap as you would think

590
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:57,300
I was looking at some time rounds to replace my wife's her old one. She loved it, but her battery exploded

591
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,900
and uh

592
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,380
Haven't been able to you know, get that going again

593
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,100
So now I either have to get a new battery and do some soldering

594
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:09,220
Try and find one, but they're like 120 bucks on ebay. Oh, wow. Mm-hmm

595
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,620
Well, they're not making any more of them. So I could see why

596
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:16,260
You hold on to it as long as you can drew. It'll be it's I mean it already kind of is a collector's item

597
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:22,900
Isn't it? Yeah, totally. Well, thanks for uh, taking one for the team and uh, totally making me miss my my old pebble watch

598
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:27,860
That sounds pretty cool and sounds like a hearty recommendation if anybody has one rolling around in a drawer out there

599
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:31,860
Yeah, absolutely. And if anybody has one in their drawer, you know, it's a good idea to have one

600
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:37,300
In a drawer out there. Yeah, absolutely. And if anybody has an old uh time round that they want to sell to me for cheap

601
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,540
I will take it

602
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,980
There you go at drew of doom on the twitters. That's right

603
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,180
slide into those dms

604
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,580
All right, let's uh, let's do a pick really quick, uh west pane you found

605
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:59,860
A markdown editor for the 21st century and you know me whenever there's a markdown editor. I want to talk about it

606
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:05,460
This is a local native application, right? I think well it is electron. Okay, okay

607
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:11,540
But you've got fedora and debian packages and app images. So, you know almost native

608
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:16,340
They're making a good concerted effort to at least publish it to the linux desktop. I'll say this

609
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,420
It looks really great. It looks like a solid app and

610
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:25,700
One of the things it has that seems kind of appealing like a differentiator to the other markdown editors

611
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:31,460
Is it has a pretty sophisticated research mode? They have a video that explains it and it's just a couple of seconds

612
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:36,180
I grabbed a clip that talks just about the research mode if you're a professional author or researcher

613
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,460
Settler has all the tools you need to write efficiently

614
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:45,220
Simply group everything together using the project feature and arrange all your chapters neatly

615
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:51,460
A mighty citation engine sits at the heart of the app letting you cite your sources with ease

616
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,540
Pull in your literature and choose from over 9000 citation styles

617
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:01,860
You can even use templates to directly export your paper using the format desired by the journal

618
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:08,580
The other thing that's kind of neat is it supports exporting to latex as well as other formats and it supports importing

619
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:14,580
A bunch of formats it has a code highlighting for different languages besides markdown as well

620
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:19,460
And of course best of all it's free and open source. No. No best of all

621
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,260
No, no best of all it's got dark mode support

622
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,900
But seriously, you know, there's a ton of really great markdown apps out there

623
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:31,380
But a lot of them kind of just stick to doing markdown and that's good

624
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:35,460
You know, but there's a whole world beyond markdown and a lot of times, you know

625
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,340
You might use markdown just for some casual notes or a simple document

626
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:44,900
Settler really lets you take it to the next level and make serious publications do research integrate with citations integrate with latex

627
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,500
It has pandoc integration as well

628
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,100
So if you know you need to pull in sources from word documents or render out to them

629
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,140
It's all built right in it really seems like too

630
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:59,140
they've taken a focus on helping people collect research either journalists or everybody like anybody that's trying to just

631
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,100
Pull together a bunch of stuff and then cite sources

632
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:05,060
With a reference manager on sitting on top of it

633
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:13,300
It seems like that component along with the ui and the import export options do kind of make it stand apart and I

634
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:17,060
I have now taken it just I write everything in markdown

635
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:22,900
I just text editor if i'm even just taking notes for something I write it in markdown if i'm making a to-do list

636
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:26,340
I do it in markdown. So this kind of stuff I find to be pretty appealing

637
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:29,700
I for the most part just stick with plain text editors

638
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:35,860
But I absolutely could see busting out settler for a research project or trying to pull something together

639
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,420
Say we're going to do a history of an open source project special

640
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:44,440
I absolutely could see using it for that kind of stuff and then it keeps it all organized for you in a really easy to

641
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,840
Browse way and you can combine everything into a project. So it's all kind of in one spot

642
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,920
Even if there's multiple files and of course on the back end, it's all just plain text

643
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,120
So, you know if you want to stop using it one day no bigs. I like that too pretty good fine there wess

644
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,600
Pretty pretty good fine. Where can people find links to that and everything else we talked about today

645
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:10,120
Well in our show notes, of course linux unplugged dot com slash three six one and that does bring us to the end of this week's

653
00:51:45,560 --> 00:52:01,980
We appreciate you and we'll see you right back here next tuesday

654
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,560
So

655
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:31,720
Thank you everybody for joining us, uh, it's time for me to head out hit the road i'm gonna i'll be on the road early tomorrow

656
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,840
So that way I can get a solid. I don't know hundred miles in before work

657
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,920
Starts and then i'll work and then as soon as work wraps up

658
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,880
I'm jumping on the road and i'll probably be driving until nearly midnight

659
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:47,240
But that's not so bad because it's so dang hot down here

660
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:53,720
That that that kind of works you drive then you park somewhere with a air conditioning you work for a little bit and then

661
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:59,240
The evening around 8 p.m. It's it becomes nice out again, and then you just drive and drive and drive

662
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:14,360
So so you've switched to being a night driver. Well, just while i'm in texas. It's because it's a lot neil
