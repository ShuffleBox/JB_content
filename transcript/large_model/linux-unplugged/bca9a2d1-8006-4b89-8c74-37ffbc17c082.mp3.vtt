WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.160
Oh, there he is.

00:01.160 --> 00:01.920
Good.

00:01.920 --> 00:03.440
I thought maybe you had a power outage or something.

00:03.440 --> 00:03.760
You know?

00:03.760 --> 00:04.440
Something crazy.

00:04.440 --> 00:05.640
No, I don't know.

00:05.640 --> 00:07.440
Internet outage maybe blipped there?

00:07.440 --> 00:08.400
I'm back now.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.800
I'm the one with the bad internet.

00:09.800 --> 00:10.440
Jeez.

00:10.440 --> 00:12.840
Did you get a good silence capture on your side?

00:12.840 --> 00:13.560
Way too long.

00:13.560 --> 00:14.680
I didn't realize what was happening,

00:14.680 --> 00:15.880
so I just kept going for, like,

00:15.880 --> 00:17.480
Isn't there a whole new friend?

00:17.480 --> 00:18.480
Ha, ha, ha.

00:26.480 --> 00:29.920
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk

00:29.920 --> 00:30.440
show.

00:30.440 --> 00:31.320
My name is Chris.

00:31.320 --> 00:32.280
My name is Wes.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.400
And my name is Brent.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.240
Hello, gentlemen.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.320
Good to see you again.

00:35.320 --> 00:38.040
It is our weekly get together, and this episode

00:38.040 --> 00:40.040
is brought to you by Cloud Guru, the leader in learning

00:40.040 --> 00:41.560
for Cloud Linux and other modern tech skills.

00:41.560 --> 00:43.400
They have hundreds of courses and thousands

00:43.400 --> 00:44.440
of hands-on labs.

00:44.440 --> 00:49.360
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.880
But coming up on the show today, you voted, and we're doing it.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.440
OpenSUSE Tumbleweed will be landing on our new garage

00:56.440 --> 00:58.440
server soon.

00:58.440 --> 01:00.440
But we have a big twist this week.

01:00.440 --> 01:02.360
And I will tell you, but it's good news.

01:02.360 --> 01:03.160
It's not bad.

01:03.160 --> 01:03.920
It is good news.

01:03.920 --> 01:05.760
I'll tell you more about that in a little bit.

01:05.760 --> 01:09.080
But this week's all about preparing our minds and bodies

01:09.080 --> 01:10.920
for a trip into SUSE land.

01:10.920 --> 01:13.560
So this week, we are preparing for that journey

01:13.560 --> 01:15.840
and figuring out what needs to be on our route,

01:15.840 --> 01:18.280
sharing our current test setups that we've built,

01:18.280 --> 01:20.760
what we've learned, what we still need to figure out,

01:20.760 --> 01:23.200
and who of us is still actually running Tumbleweed

01:23.200 --> 01:24.840
as we do this episode.

01:24.840 --> 01:27.800
But first, we got to say hello to our virtual log.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.480
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

01:29.480 --> 01:30.360
Hello, hello.

01:30.360 --> 01:30.860
Hello.

01:30.860 --> 01:31.360
Hello.

01:31.360 --> 01:31.860
Hello.

01:31.860 --> 01:32.360
Hello.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.120
Hello, Wes and Chris.

01:33.120 --> 01:33.600
Hello.

01:33.600 --> 01:36.000
Something tells me we'll need your help today, Mumble Room.

01:36.000 --> 01:36.400
Yeah.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.860
Yeah, it's going to be one of those.

01:37.860 --> 01:40.800
So while we're talking about the SUSE,

01:40.800 --> 01:43.320
let's talk about the 2021 Tuxi nominations,

01:43.320 --> 01:45.200
because yeah, they're open again.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.680
And we need you to go vote for the best free software

01:47.680 --> 01:49.880
project, the real standout distro of the year,

01:49.880 --> 01:52.520
your text editor that you just loved this year,

01:52.520 --> 01:55.760
a new project that came along that really blew you away,

01:55.760 --> 01:57.800
a strong server distro, and a lot more.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.280
It's all in a probably three to four minute survey

02:01.280 --> 02:04.600
that we've built on a Nextcloud box that you can go take.

02:04.600 --> 02:09.720
And right now, I'm a little suspicious, Wes.

02:09.720 --> 02:11.340
Actually, let's do a little aside here.

02:11.340 --> 02:11.840
Wes.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.000
The cone of science.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.640
Wash your hands on the cone, man.

02:14.640 --> 02:15.200
I know.

02:15.200 --> 02:15.520
I know.

02:15.520 --> 02:16.760
I had to make room for Brent.

02:16.760 --> 02:17.420
Thanks, guys.

02:17.420 --> 02:19.480
So we have a problem, I think.

02:19.480 --> 02:22.560
And I don't really know if it's genuinely a problem

02:22.560 --> 02:23.760
or what we should do.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.960
And I don't want the audience to have doubt

02:26.960 --> 02:29.280
in the sanctity of the Tuxis.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.680
But it seems very strange to me how far ahead

02:32.680 --> 02:35.600
SUSE is polling in the various areas where

02:35.600 --> 02:37.120
SUSE is an option right now.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.680
Oh, are you suggesting some sort of foul play?

02:40.680 --> 02:42.320
Lizard foul play, perhaps?

02:42.320 --> 02:45.180
I mean, I was suspicious with the survey around the server.

02:45.180 --> 02:47.680
And then I got word that it was shared around internally.

02:47.680 --> 02:49.300
And I'm just wondering.

02:49.300 --> 02:51.320
We've got a lot of great answers.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.760
But whenever SUSE is an option, it's

02:53.760 --> 02:55.400
number one in every category.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.680
It could just be that there's some sort of SUSE fever

02:57.680 --> 02:58.940
sweeping the audience.

02:58.940 --> 03:00.560
Here's what we'll do.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.920
We don't want to tell the audience, obviously.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.240
Don't want to spoil anything.

03:04.240 --> 03:05.320
We don't want to concern them.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.520
We want them to trust the sanctity of the Tuxis.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.640
So what I'm thinking we do is we'll just

03:09.640 --> 03:12.320
compel them to go vote by offering free cookies

03:12.320 --> 03:13.660
at the voting booths.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.460
And then hopefully we just get more numbers

03:15.460 --> 03:16.800
and just sort of wash it all out.

03:16.800 --> 03:17.300
Yeah.

03:17.300 --> 03:17.800
Hmm.

03:17.800 --> 03:18.400
Yeah.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.400
That seems pretty doable.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.200
Brent, you better get bacon, buddy.

03:21.200 --> 03:21.720
OK.

03:21.720 --> 03:22.640
Yeah, no kidding.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.600
The cone of silence.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.520
So yeah, the 2021 Tuxi nominations are open.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.900
And at the various polling booths right now,

03:30.900 --> 03:33.680
we are handing out free cookies for no other reason

03:33.680 --> 03:35.560
than we just want to get as many people out.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.000
Oh, it seems we've had 407 responses.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.560
So let's see if we can't double that by next episode.

03:40.560 --> 03:43.180
It means everybody's going to have to get out and go vote.

03:43.180 --> 03:45.040
You can find a link in our show notes

03:45.040 --> 03:47.840
to participate or go to tuxis.party.

03:47.840 --> 03:51.760
And also, our first use of Nextcloud for something

03:51.760 --> 03:52.760
like this.

03:52.760 --> 03:53.840
All right, all right.

03:53.840 --> 03:57.360
There's going to be some more zoos later on in the show.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.200
Let's do some community news first.

03:59.200 --> 04:06.880
Steam belt activated.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.560
So we may, by this time next year,

04:09.560 --> 04:14.640
be talking about how SteamOS is the next up-and-coming Linux

04:14.640 --> 04:16.120
desktop environment.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.200
Now, hear me out, hear me out.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.440
So I got some bad news.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.080
We learned this week that the deck

04:21.080 --> 04:23.520
was going to be delayed until February 2021.

04:23.520 --> 04:24.960
So a two-month delay.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.960
But in that same batch of news, we also

04:28.960 --> 04:34.320
learned that SteamOS, which is Arch-based,

04:34.320 --> 04:37.400
is going to use an immutable file system.

04:37.400 --> 04:41.240
Will SteamOS have a read-only immutable OS file system?

04:41.240 --> 04:44.600
Yes, so by default, the OS updates

04:44.600 --> 04:47.840
will be distributed as a whole OS image.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.680
But you can enter a developer mode,

04:49.680 --> 04:51.520
which will let you modify the file system

04:51.520 --> 04:54.160
and install packages like a normal distribution.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.600
So this is sort of like Silverblue or KinoKnight

04:56.600 --> 05:01.120
or Ubuntu Core, only it's a full modern plasma

05:01.120 --> 05:05.000
Wayland-based desktop produced by Valve that's

05:05.000 --> 05:08.760
going to have a safe, reversible update mechanism thanks

05:08.760 --> 05:10.360
to this immutable file system.

05:10.360 --> 05:13.040
And then support for Flatpaks to add applications

05:13.040 --> 05:15.640
without even having to turn those protections off.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.120
Isn't this what we've been asking for for a very long time,

05:18.120 --> 05:20.720
is some large vendor to use plasma

05:20.720 --> 05:23.360
and build a professional-grade workstation?

05:23.360 --> 05:25.840
They've taken the ideal Arch workstation

05:25.840 --> 05:28.320
and brought it to the next level by adding an immutable file

05:28.320 --> 05:29.480
system, in my opinion.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.160
I don't know that they'd say they're

05:31.160 --> 05:32.640
targeting the workstation.

05:32.640 --> 05:34.400
But yeah, I see where you're going with this.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.920
I mean, we also kind of suspected

05:35.920 --> 05:37.080
they might have to do this, whether it

05:37.080 --> 05:38.960
was their own repository or, I guess,

05:38.960 --> 05:41.680
as it seems, some kind of image-based solution.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.680
They're going to need some kind of stability layer on top of Arch.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.560
And I think, what, you're just hoping, then,

05:46.560 --> 05:50.120
that the way they do it will be, in the usual way of open source,

05:50.120 --> 05:55.000
a way that, say, a Garuda user over here could take advantage of?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.800
Well, it's not my idea.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.560
It's actually Linus Torvalds' idea.

05:58.560 --> 05:59.520
He said it years ago.

05:59.520 --> 06:03.000
He said, it's going to take a vendor like Valve,

06:03.000 --> 06:04.120
literally what he said.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.560
It's going to take a vendor like Valve

06:06.560 --> 06:08.320
to product up the Linux desktop and make

06:08.320 --> 06:09.540
it usable by average users.

06:09.540 --> 06:12.000
And here's what I actually expect would happen.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.720
For people like you and I, we would probably

06:14.720 --> 06:18.880
be using some sort of open community fork of SteamOS

06:18.880 --> 06:20.920
that is packaging it up for a workstation.

06:20.920 --> 06:24.920
It includes the immutable OS and the Arch patches and all of that.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.920
But maybe it doesn't automatically

06:26.920 --> 06:29.640
boot into big picture mode, or whatever they're going to call it.

06:29.640 --> 06:33.040
So it's probably a community fork of the term,

06:33.040 --> 06:35.840
maybe loosely using the term fork, is what I would expect happens.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.520
Do you gentlemen have any guesses on what's under the hood

06:38.520 --> 06:39.680
making all this possible?

06:39.680 --> 06:41.080
Not totally, no.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.840
I'm actually really curious to get my hands on it.

06:43.840 --> 06:47.440
They say they won't release it until after the deck is

06:47.440 --> 06:48.280
released.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.040
So I was hoping they'd release it sooner

06:50.040 --> 06:52.360
so we could start kind of understanding how

06:52.360 --> 06:54.120
the deck works before it ships.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.560
Because I think that would actually,

06:55.560 --> 06:57.460
having a community out there that kind of understands

06:57.460 --> 06:59.200
the underpinnings of that thing may actually

06:59.200 --> 07:00.360
help it be more successful.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.760
But I think Valve's just kind of focused on getting the deck out,

07:03.760 --> 07:05.160
and that's where all efforts are.

07:05.160 --> 07:08.120
And they're not, they don't want to spend the time packaging it

07:08.120 --> 07:09.840
up to distribute it to the community yet.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.560
Yeah, you get it over the wall, and then maybe you clean things up.

07:12.560 --> 07:13.520
I get that.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.400
Minimac, you had an experience with an OS that does this as well.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.040
Well, there is a rather famous phone

07:19.040 --> 07:21.000
OS called Ubuntu Touch that does that too.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.080
So the base system is, in fact, in LXC LXD containers.

07:26.080 --> 07:28.960
So it doesn't allow you to change the system, which

07:28.960 --> 07:33.400
has a really cool thing offer, because it

07:33.400 --> 07:37.120
allows you to switch from stable to experimental and back.

07:37.120 --> 07:40.200
You just change the container, and then you just continue,

07:40.200 --> 07:42.780
and your data is in a separate container.

07:42.780 --> 07:44.040
So that's pretty cool.

07:44.040 --> 07:46.400
Yeah, it gives you a nice escape hatch.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.680
It really does kind of make a workstation a little more bulletproof.

07:49.680 --> 07:53.000
I wonder if they are just going to use OS Tree,

07:53.000 --> 07:56.560
and they do end up just using Flatpaks for application distribution, which

07:56.560 --> 08:00.080
is kind of admittedly how it looks on the surface right now.

08:00.080 --> 08:03.920
That could mean that they're planning to probably offer some,

08:03.920 --> 08:07.040
maybe they could offer some of that stuff outside of SteamOS as well.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.520
And Valve is officially packaging it in these different channels.

08:10.520 --> 08:13.120
A lot of things are going to change for gaming on Linux

08:13.120 --> 08:16.120
after this, because the other part of this

08:16.120 --> 08:19.000
is the games that do publish through Steam

08:19.000 --> 08:22.960
can opt in to take advantage of the Steam Deck Verified program.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.920
And Valve will test how the game performs in Proton

08:26.920 --> 08:30.400
now before the developers have actually even released it.

08:30.400 --> 08:33.040
So while not every game will take advantage of this,

08:33.040 --> 08:36.560
and not every game ships through Steam, a lot more will.

08:36.560 --> 08:39.600
And so that means a hell of a lot more games

08:39.600 --> 08:43.360
are just going to have Linux support one way or another on day one

08:43.360 --> 08:45.040
once the Deck is launched.

08:45.040 --> 08:48.520
Even if you never buy a Deck, it's just great news

08:48.520 --> 08:50.400
for all desktop Linux users.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.040
Yeah, really.

08:51.040 --> 08:54.080
You get that so much, hopefully, so much earlier in the cycle, right?

08:54.080 --> 08:55.560
When you're starting to think about these things,

08:55.560 --> 08:57.560
when you're thinking about the publishing process,

08:57.560 --> 09:01.160
rather than after the fact when a very small little niche of users

09:01.160 --> 09:03.200
maybe start emailing you asking for support.

09:03.200 --> 09:07.120
Yeah, do it before you're all in on using MSHTML

09:07.120 --> 09:10.160
when you could still switch over to a different open web render.

09:10.160 --> 09:13.480
We went into a lot more detail in this week's Linux action news,

09:13.480 --> 09:18.280
and including some of the nuances around things developers

09:18.280 --> 09:20.920
are going to run into when they do try to do this.

09:20.920 --> 09:24.680
It's not as rosy as the initial announcement makes it seem,

09:24.680 --> 09:26.400
but it's not impossible either.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.080
So we have details in there.

09:28.080 --> 09:31.280
OK, so this week I was really disappointed in some behavior

09:31.280 --> 09:35.400
that I saw online by Rocky Linux in a couple of ways.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.080
And I normally wouldn't even talk about this kind of thing on air.

09:38.080 --> 09:43.240
I'd probably just grouse about it to the guys behind the mic and move on.

09:43.240 --> 09:48.120
But December is approaching, and the transition from CentOS Traditional

09:48.120 --> 09:52.920
to Stream, and then into the life of the Traditional product, is soon.

09:52.920 --> 09:56.400
And all of the rel clones are technically very similar.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.120
If they weren't, they'd be failing at their job.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.680
And there's a lot more out there between just Alma and Rocky.

10:02.680 --> 10:05.040
I think probably Oracle has probably the other most famous.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.880
Of course, we all remember ones like Scientific Linux as well.

10:07.880 --> 10:12.240
Today, when I was grabbing one more ISO before the show,

10:12.240 --> 10:15.320
I wanted to grab the transactional OpenSUSE ISO.

10:15.320 --> 10:20.680
I was lazy, and I just went to Google, and I just searched OpenSUSE download.

10:20.680 --> 10:21.880
And this is really gross to me.

10:21.880 --> 10:28.400
What I got were a bunch of paid links by Greg's company for Rocky Linux.

10:28.400 --> 10:31.120
In my opinion, clickjacking OpenSUSE users,

10:31.120 --> 10:33.600
trying to redirect them to Rocky Linux.

10:33.600 --> 10:37.320
And it just feels really gross, because they're not taking ads out

10:37.320 --> 10:40.240
to try to grab clicks from SUSE Enterprise Linux.

10:40.240 --> 10:44.400
They're trying to go after the free community OpenSUSE.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.560
And that just seems out of bounds to me.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.720
And I would hope that a distribution that's

10:48.720 --> 10:51.040
going to have the prominence and position in the community

10:51.040 --> 10:54.360
that Rocky might have one day would understand

10:54.360 --> 10:58.560
how awful and demotivating that is to people behind the project.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.440
And I know for a fact it is.

11:00.440 --> 11:04.120
How do you think the people behind these projects feel when Greg's company,

11:04.120 --> 11:06.840
so that way Rocky doesn't do it directly, right, or maybe they can't,

11:06.840 --> 11:10.840
when Greg's company, CICQ or whatever the hell it is,

11:10.840 --> 11:14.160
goes out there and buys this stuff and clickjacks from OpenSUSE?

11:14.160 --> 11:17.680
Now, probably minimal impact, let's be honest, but it doesn't look good,

11:17.680 --> 11:20.840
and it's definitely not in the spirit of free software and community.

11:20.840 --> 11:24.360
And, boy, it probably feels bad if it is successful,

11:24.360 --> 11:27.480
if the campaign were successful, which you would think the Rocky folks would

11:27.480 --> 11:29.080
want their campaign to be successful,

11:29.080 --> 11:32.600
you would think they would want their investment to be worthwhile.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.400
It would mean less downloads for OpenSUSE.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.280
What does that mean for the project?

11:37.280 --> 11:41.600
And then what also is just very, very disappointing about this entire thing.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.080
A week or two ago, Rocky Linux held an AMA.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.000
It was fine.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.600
A few things in there I disagreed with, but, you know,

11:47.600 --> 11:49.880
it's their moment to interact with the community.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.960
Today, Alma Linux held an AMA.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.640
And, of course, Greg is in there stirring crap up.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.680
While the Alma folks stayed completely out of the Rocky AMA,

11:57.680 --> 12:00.400
Greg's in there throwing bombs.

12:00.400 --> 12:03.480
And in that AMA, he essentially calls me a liar,

12:03.480 --> 12:06.040
saying that screenshot's from months ago, which is crap.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.200
I do have a screenshot from months ago,

12:08.200 --> 12:10.360
back when they were doing this to Alma.

12:10.360 --> 12:13.920
At the end of July, they did the same thing against Alma.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.280
But that feels a little different.

12:15.280 --> 12:18.840
That's at least competitor to competitor.

12:18.840 --> 12:22.920
I don't think it's a good look, but it feels inbounds.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.600
But the screenshot today of the Rocky Linux ads

12:25.600 --> 12:29.920
when I searched for OpenSUSE were from just hours ago.

12:29.920 --> 12:33.360
Not only do I have the file timestamp on my hard drive,

12:33.360 --> 12:35.840
but I immediately shared it in our team chat.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.240
And I have the timestamp on that from this morning,

12:38.240 --> 12:41.800
because I was getting ready for the show this morning.

12:41.800 --> 12:44.280
And Greg in the AMA says I'm lying about that,

12:44.280 --> 12:47.080
that it's from months ago, that they don't do that anymore.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.640
So either he's completely unaware of what his company does

12:49.640 --> 12:51.480
and what they're doing on behalf of his company

12:51.480 --> 12:54.800
for the distribution that he's now launched, or he's lying.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.720
Either one's not a good look.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.320
And again, I come back to these RHEL clones

12:58.320 --> 13:00.880
are technically identical.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.920
So what makes the difference long term

13:02.920 --> 13:06.800
is the team structure and the people behind the distribution.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.240
That's why this matters right now.

13:09.240 --> 13:12.680
And maybe you've noticed, I've noticed,

13:12.680 --> 13:15.200
Rocky seems to have been late on every RHEL beta

13:15.200 --> 13:17.400
and release compared to Alma.

13:17.400 --> 13:20.400
So maybe, in my opinion, they should

13:20.400 --> 13:23.920
focus less on scamming people into using their distribution

13:23.920 --> 13:25.600
and instead, in my opinion, work more

13:25.600 --> 13:28.680
on their release pipeline and their release timeline.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.360
I just find the whole thing gross.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.640
One of the big questions I have is,

13:32.640 --> 13:34.480
that's only the stuff you noticed.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.320
That's one person noticing one thing.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.720
Where else are they putting ads?

13:37.720 --> 13:40.520
Who else are they trying to steal stuff from?

13:40.520 --> 13:42.240
I don't know that much about the projects,

13:42.240 --> 13:45.400
but the more I learn, it feels a little disappointing.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.360
I want them both to succeed, and they're

13:47.360 --> 13:49.600
doing something a little bit different, but jeez.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.280
I know.

13:50.280 --> 13:50.840
Come on.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.580
I would say, ultimately, I felt like we

13:52.580 --> 13:55.120
had a moment here for a real enterprise community that

13:55.120 --> 13:57.920
included all of these clones.

13:57.920 --> 14:02.440
And the going in the AMA and dropping bombs,

14:02.440 --> 14:06.600
and then later on calling me a liar, why would you do that?

14:06.600 --> 14:09.360
Why would you go in there and call me a liar like that?

14:09.360 --> 14:10.400
It's not from months ago.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.900
And why would I claim it's from this morning

14:11.900 --> 14:13.640
if it wasn't?

14:13.640 --> 14:16.380
The whole thing is extremely disappointing.

14:16.380 --> 14:19.040
And you're coming at me when I've got not only the receipts,

14:19.040 --> 14:20.880
but I've got an audience and a platform, too.

14:20.880 --> 14:24.380
It just doesn't make any sense, and it just seems reactionary,

14:24.380 --> 14:26.760
and it seems crass, and miscalculated

14:26.760 --> 14:27.760
from the very beginning.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.720
Doesn't really address the root of the issue either, right?

14:29.720 --> 14:31.520
OK, even if somehow you were wrong,

14:31.520 --> 14:33.040
you're still doing it in the past.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.440
Have you really addressed that?

14:34.440 --> 14:35.680
Yeah, that's got to be what it was, right?

14:35.680 --> 14:37.920
It's like, drop a bomb here, so that way you're not

14:37.920 --> 14:40.160
paying attention to what was actually going down over here.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.440
I mean, it's hard to say.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.540
This whole thing is unfortunate.

14:43.540 --> 14:45.160
It's just our experiences, so.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.660
You know, one of the very first questions

14:46.660 --> 14:48.240
that I saw in that AMA this morning

14:48.240 --> 14:51.760
when I was waking up and doing the online thing

14:51.760 --> 14:55.720
was, what is the difference between Alma and Rocky?

14:55.720 --> 14:58.280
And that's an excellent question from the audience.

14:58.280 --> 15:01.480
And the Alma team had a great description.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.520
And they said, oh, yeah, we're doing

15:03.520 --> 15:04.480
slightly different things.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.520
Here's what's different about it.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.200
And they were almost celebrating the fact

15:07.200 --> 15:08.180
that they both existed.

15:08.180 --> 15:10.600
And it was really refreshing to see.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.800
And I didn't see any of the updates since then.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.400
But it's really disappointing to hear

15:14.400 --> 15:15.600
which direction that took.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.340
And it's clouding, sort of, Alma's chance

15:18.340 --> 15:20.480
to connect with the community, it sounds like.

15:20.480 --> 15:21.080
Well put.

15:21.080 --> 15:22.220
We'll have a link to that AMA, though,

15:22.220 --> 15:23.720
because there is some really good information

15:23.720 --> 15:25.480
and some good questions answered in there.

15:25.480 --> 15:29.480
Lino.com slash unplugged.

15:29.480 --> 15:32.680
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.240
And you go there to support the show.

15:34.240 --> 15:37.040
So it's lino.com slash unplugged.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.960
It's where we've built everything

15:38.960 --> 15:41.480
that we call infrastructure in the last couple of years.

15:41.480 --> 15:44.080
It's how I host everything that needs to run on Linux.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.520
Just for this episode alone, Wes is

15:46.520 --> 15:48.080
going to go into detail about how

15:48.080 --> 15:51.000
he was able to leverage all of the tools

15:51.000 --> 15:53.280
that Linode gives you to do a custom

15:53.280 --> 15:55.400
install of SUSE on Linode.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.940
And I wanted to actually mention this,

15:56.940 --> 16:00.200
because a big usage for us with Linode

16:00.200 --> 16:04.720
is an R&D lab, because the systems are just wicked fast.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.260
They're just wicked fast.

16:06.260 --> 16:09.200
They have brand new MBME storage they're rolling out.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.320
They have 40 gigabit connections coming into the hypervisor.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.360
And then for the distros they support,

16:14.360 --> 16:16.360
they locally mirror the repos.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.680
So when you do an update, the updates

16:18.680 --> 16:21.360
slam down to your rig so fast, it's

16:21.360 --> 16:23.920
faster than your SSH terminal could update the output

16:23.920 --> 16:25.640
of the package manager.

16:25.640 --> 16:27.760
And then when you're pulling anything off the internet,

16:27.760 --> 16:28.880
it's just stupid fast.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.340
And then because they have 11 data centers around the world

16:31.340 --> 16:33.800
to choose from, you can pick something that's close to you.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.880
So I often will pick something here on the West Coast

16:35.880 --> 16:37.460
when we're doing an R&D lab thing,

16:37.460 --> 16:39.120
because even with my Comcast connection,

16:39.120 --> 16:42.760
I just get an incredibly fast, low latency connection

16:42.760 --> 16:43.560
to Linode.

16:43.560 --> 16:45.760
And then if we're doing something that the audience is

16:45.760 --> 16:48.800
going to bang on, I'll generally more centrally deploy it.

16:48.800 --> 16:49.640
It's so great.

16:49.640 --> 16:52.120
And every step along the way, I never

16:52.120 --> 16:54.040
feel like I'm being limited by the tooling.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.640
Like if we got to the point, which we did this week, where

16:56.640 --> 16:59.560
we just wanted to replace the OS and deploy something

16:59.560 --> 17:02.040
that they don't have in the dropdown selection,

17:02.040 --> 17:03.200
we could do it.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.400
And I've done that before for my own mesh VPN system.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.780
And I don't often have to do that.

17:08.780 --> 17:13.280
It seems like maybe about once a year, I get down to the metal.

17:13.280 --> 17:16.000
And every time, I am just so grateful

17:16.000 --> 17:17.720
that Linode doesn't hide that stuff,

17:17.720 --> 17:18.840
doesn't prevent that stuff.

17:18.840 --> 17:22.680
In fact, we follow a guide from Linode on how to do it.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.260
Then on top of that, of course, they've

17:24.260 --> 17:26.480
got the one-click deployment of an entire stack

17:26.480 --> 17:28.360
that you can just get up and get running.

17:28.360 --> 17:29.680
Generally, what they'll do is they'll

17:29.680 --> 17:31.140
have you just fill out a couple of questions

17:31.140 --> 17:34.600
about how you want it set up, like in the case of, say,

17:34.600 --> 17:37.040
like a GitLab server or a Minecraft server

17:37.040 --> 17:38.960
or a lot of these.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.600
You can fill out a couple of fields,

17:40.600 --> 17:42.560
hit Deploy, and you've got a system ready to go.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.520
So you can go that one-click route as well.

17:45.520 --> 17:46.600
You have that full range.

17:46.600 --> 17:49.280
And it works, and it's so fast, and it's so reliable,

17:49.280 --> 17:50.480
and then it's just so straightforward

17:50.480 --> 17:52.080
to put it in production and then know

17:52.080 --> 17:54.480
that you can turn on those Linode backups, and you got it.

17:54.480 --> 17:55.840
And if you ever just need to grow your storage,

17:55.840 --> 17:57.720
like we've had that problem where we're like,

17:57.720 --> 17:59.000
we need more disk.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.120
They've got object storage.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.480
You can easily add more block storage,

18:02.480 --> 18:03.600
and it's all just so fast.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.160
On top of that, they have high-end CPU and high memory

18:06.160 --> 18:09.840
and even GPU rigs, and they're rolling out bare metal as well.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.960
And their VLAN support is slick.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.400
God, it's so cool now when you set up a Linode.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.760
Like, I can join them to the VLANs.

18:16.760 --> 18:17.880
I can have the SSH keys.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.300
I can do all this stuff that just

18:19.300 --> 18:24.160
makes it so quick to get in and get going and start building.

18:24.160 --> 18:28.080
So go try it out and really put that $100 to work.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.840
That's going to really let you try this thing out.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.880
See what we've been saying, linode.com slash unplugged.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.520
Go there to support the show and get yourself $100 in credit

18:35.520 --> 18:39.480
for a new account, linode.com slash unplugged.

18:39.480 --> 18:44.400
All right, well, let's try to find something a little more

18:44.400 --> 18:46.480
positive to talk about.

18:46.480 --> 18:49.800
Chris, we had quite the development over the weekend.

18:49.800 --> 18:52.640
I think we should probably catch the audience up on.

18:52.640 --> 18:55.000
You know, Wes, we have really, it's

18:55.000 --> 18:57.280
cliche for people to say, oh, we have the best audience.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.720
But we really, truly have the best audience.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.640
No comparison.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.880
So we had a listener bring us up another Dell server

19:05.880 --> 19:06.680
this weekend.

19:06.680 --> 19:07.960
And I didn't grab all the specs.

19:07.960 --> 19:10.920
So I will go into it when we actually do the build.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.280
I'll go into the details.

19:12.280 --> 19:15.720
But we got another Dell server loaded up and ready to go.

19:15.720 --> 19:19.280
We have two systems that are honestly probably

19:19.280 --> 19:21.720
nicer than what I would have bought, both of them.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.920
And now we have two of them that have been given to us

19:23.920 --> 19:25.640
by different audience members.

19:25.640 --> 19:28.840
And it just, it's so awesome because, of course, this

19:28.840 --> 19:30.520
means now we can do some backups.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.840
We can do some fun things with all kinds

19:32.840 --> 19:33.640
of different projects.

19:33.640 --> 19:37.040
I mean, the possibilities and the directions

19:37.040 --> 19:39.560
we can take that for the show and the content and ideas

19:39.560 --> 19:40.960
that we're going to have in the lab.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.280
And it's just, it's so awesome.

19:43.280 --> 19:47.200
And so, yeah, we had a great experience this weekend.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.960
While Wes and I were recording Linux Action News,

19:49.960 --> 19:52.920
we took a break and broke lunch with this listener.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.400
And they dropped off the server for us.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.680
And we chatted for a bit and then got back to doing LAN.

19:57.680 --> 19:58.840
And now it's sitting here.

19:58.840 --> 19:59.440
And I'm just looking at it.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.440
I just can't believe it.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.440
We have two of these beautiful big servers.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.280
And we have a lot in store.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.080
That's going to be kicking off really soon.

20:06.080 --> 20:10.080
So today was really all about us getting oriented with OpenSUSE

20:10.080 --> 20:12.360
because we've all taken cracks at it before.

20:12.360 --> 20:13.320
I don't know exactly.

20:13.320 --> 20:15.820
I can't remember if we did Leap or Tumbleweed in the past.

20:15.820 --> 20:18.960
But we really were looking at the desktop of OpenSUSE.

20:18.960 --> 20:22.120
Don't think I'd ever run OpenSUSE on a server properly,

20:22.120 --> 20:24.800
more than for just boot the ISO and check things out

20:24.800 --> 20:25.400
or something.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.720
Yeah, I mean, I'd done SLES a lot back in the day,

20:27.720 --> 20:31.320
the Enterprise product, but never OpenSUSE as a server

20:31.320 --> 20:32.720
and never Tumbleweed as a server.

20:32.720 --> 20:36.000
But that was what the audience voted for, for our new server.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.800
So we wanted to get oriented.

20:37.800 --> 20:41.800
And Wes, you took the route of deploying it on Linode.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.760
But just with one hitch, Linode doesn't

20:44.760 --> 20:46.920
have Tumbleweed as an option.

20:46.920 --> 20:48.720
No, no they don't.

20:48.720 --> 20:51.120
And I don't know, I wanted to go out there this time.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.120
So I thought, when we first started thinking,

20:53.120 --> 20:54.920
we better get prepared for this.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.120
We're not ready to design the layout for these servers

20:57.120 --> 20:59.600
yet, because we're not familiar with the operating system

20:59.600 --> 21:00.320
enough.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.040
So we've been playing with it, and we both

21:02.040 --> 21:04.360
saw that there was this transactional server setup

21:04.360 --> 21:05.280
that you could do.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.000
We didn't try it at the time, but I thought, all right,

21:07.000 --> 21:08.640
this time, this time I'm going to do it.

21:08.640 --> 21:11.160
But yeah, Linode doesn't have Tumbleweed,

21:11.160 --> 21:13.560
let alone the transactional server version of it.

21:13.560 --> 21:17.040
And after playing with Kinoite the other day with Fedora 35,

21:17.040 --> 21:17.800
I was hooked.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.000
I had to try it.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.840
Now, they do have Leap on Linode?

21:21.840 --> 21:22.360
Yeah.

21:22.360 --> 21:23.800
That's probably what you should really do.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.140
Like, if you're going to do this properly,

21:25.140 --> 21:27.120
you're not going to do it the weird west way.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.400
They have an upgrade path where you can go from Leap

21:29.400 --> 21:30.360
to Tumbleweed.

21:30.360 --> 21:31.880
We'll have some instructions linked in the doc

21:31.880 --> 21:32.880
if you want to play it.

21:32.880 --> 21:35.960
But that seemed a little too straightforward to me.

21:35.960 --> 21:36.840
It's boring.

21:36.840 --> 21:41.440
So instead, I decided I'd boot up a Fedora 35 box.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.080
Of course.

21:42.080 --> 21:45.120
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.640
Why Fedora 35?

21:46.640 --> 21:50.480
My instinct would be, go get a Tumbleweed ISO and boot that.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.480
Why did you go Fedora 35?

21:52.480 --> 21:53.440
Oh, you'll see.

21:53.440 --> 21:54.800
OK, all right.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.040
I got my Fedora 35 going, you know, quick and easy

21:57.040 --> 21:58.440
on Linode is great.

21:58.440 --> 22:01.020
And then I downloaded the Tumbleweed network installer.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.520
They have a little network installer,

22:02.520 --> 22:03.400
and I always love these, right?

22:03.400 --> 22:05.400
Because you're going to get the fresh packages anyway.

22:05.400 --> 22:08.280
Why not just start with the minimal thing that you need?

22:08.280 --> 22:10.360
Mounted that ISO.

22:10.360 --> 22:14.000
And then I used my old friend, Kexec, to get things started.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.500
And that's why I picked Fedora 35,

22:16.500 --> 22:18.960
because I know Fedora ships with Kexec right out of the box.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.960
I just love that, which also, hey, Tumbleweed does too.

22:21.960 --> 22:23.240
So that's great.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.040
I should have known.

22:24.040 --> 22:25.120
I don't even know why I doubt it.

22:25.120 --> 22:26.200
I should have known.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.960
So you Kexec'd from Fedora into Tumbleweed?

22:28.960 --> 22:31.540
Yes, I wasn't really sure how this was going to work.

22:31.540 --> 22:34.160
I did kind of prototype it a little bit in QEMU

22:34.160 --> 22:37.160
on my local machine, and it seemed viable.

22:37.160 --> 22:38.840
What really made this possible, though,

22:38.840 --> 22:42.720
was that Linode has a graphical web console you can use.

22:42.720 --> 22:46.240
So I was able to just pop up an SSH, run Kexec,

22:46.240 --> 22:49.760
and then do sudo systemctl kexec to get things going.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.460
And of course, my connection drops there.

22:51.460 --> 22:55.280
But I can go onto Linode, boot up the graphical console,

22:55.280 --> 22:57.440
watch the darn thing boot, and then I

22:57.440 --> 23:01.560
was greeted by the normal yast graphical installer,

23:01.560 --> 23:05.240
just like I was installing it here locally at my house.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.600
That's great.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.360
I was going to say, I think you probably

23:08.360 --> 23:10.560
could have made it easier and just gone with the ISO,

23:10.560 --> 23:13.520
but that sounds a lot more your style.

23:13.520 --> 23:15.520
And so then do you take over that system,

23:15.520 --> 23:17.200
or are you still just Kexec?

23:17.200 --> 23:18.440
How is that working?

23:18.440 --> 23:20.960
Well, yeah, so now I'm just running the installer kernel

23:20.960 --> 23:24.160
and initramfs, and it kind of has just enough in there

23:24.160 --> 23:27.000
to go onto the internet, DHCP, Linode.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.960
That's the nice part, is it's really just running it

23:28.960 --> 23:29.520
in a data center.

23:29.520 --> 23:32.720
It has the stuff it needs, so it just bootstrapped itself

23:32.720 --> 23:35.240
and presented me with a normal screen of like, hey,

23:35.240 --> 23:36.800
what do you want to install here?

23:36.800 --> 23:39.280
Now, did you go with the transactional system,

23:39.280 --> 23:40.920
or did you go with the traditional server?

23:40.920 --> 23:42.440
Because you have two options now when

23:42.440 --> 23:43.680
you're installing OpenSUSE.

23:43.680 --> 23:46.240
Yeah, I went with the transactional this time.

23:46.240 --> 23:47.360
I thought, why not, right?

23:47.360 --> 23:50.040
Like, the stuff is, it seems like it's eventually

23:50.040 --> 23:52.040
going to be the way in one form or another,

23:52.040 --> 23:54.320
and I want to see the Tumbleweed and the OpenSUSE

23:54.320 --> 23:55.520
take on this.

23:55.520 --> 23:58.800
I will say, I do really like the Yast installer.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.360
It might be my favorite install.

24:00.360 --> 24:00.800
I don't know.

24:00.800 --> 24:01.360
It is a lot.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.840
There's a lot going on there.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.440
But I was impressed that it was willing to go grab

24:05.440 --> 24:08.520
existing SSH keys off the Fedora 35 install.

24:08.520 --> 24:09.400
That was nice, right?

24:09.400 --> 24:10.640
Because Linode has an option.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.760
I just pre-checked the SSH keys some of the JB team members

24:13.760 --> 24:14.760
have put in there.

24:14.760 --> 24:16.680
Didn't have to give those up even though I was overriding

24:16.680 --> 24:17.680
the whole darn server.

24:17.680 --> 24:18.480
Wow.

24:18.480 --> 24:19.760
That's awesome, actually.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.680
You know what I liked about the installer is that summary

24:22.680 --> 24:26.200
at the end, like it says firewall on, SE Linux off,

24:26.200 --> 24:28.600
CPU mitigations on, and they're linked.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.680
So you could just click it and adjust the setting right there.

24:30.680 --> 24:31.320
And I'm like, yeah, you know what?

24:31.320 --> 24:32.480
I don't want my firewall on.

24:32.480 --> 24:34.520
And I don't want CPU mitigations in this VM.

24:34.520 --> 24:35.960
So no, turn them off.

24:35.960 --> 24:36.680
That was great.

24:36.680 --> 24:37.560
It's definitely a lot.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.280
But I think it was a nice balance, too,

24:39.280 --> 24:41.760
in that it felt very intuitive in a way

24:41.760 --> 24:43.560
that I know I harp on this way too much,

24:43.560 --> 24:46.640
but in a way that Anaconda just never has for me.

24:46.640 --> 24:48.200
Poor Anaconda.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.440
Yeah, it felt to me like the interface

24:50.440 --> 24:52.560
was hiding a bunch of super user features

24:52.560 --> 24:54.040
right where you needed them.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.720
They weren't in your face, but if you wanted them,

24:55.720 --> 24:58.080
they're just a click away, which I really appreciate it, too.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.080
Yeah, definitely.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.920
Did you do anything update-wise and see

25:00.920 --> 25:03.360
how the transactional stuff works and snapshots work?

25:03.360 --> 25:04.600
Did you suss that out?

25:04.600 --> 25:05.680
Yes, I did.

25:05.680 --> 25:08.760
OK, so I got it installed, and then it was reboot time.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.880
And at first, I was pretty worried that, dang it,

25:10.880 --> 25:11.760
I shouldn't have gone this route.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.760
It wasn't going to work, because when I rebooted,

25:13.760 --> 25:16.800
I was just met with a blank rescue grub screen.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.920
But I think, actually, this is just a little thing.

25:18.920 --> 25:21.520
I saw some issues around when these similar changes happened

25:21.520 --> 25:24.800
to the grub setup in the Fedora land, I think around Fedora 30.

25:24.800 --> 25:27.520
And it's just something about the way Linode specifically boots

25:27.520 --> 25:30.000
and the grub config it expects.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.120
So I was able to just hit Exit and get to the grub install

25:33.120 --> 25:37.240
that OpenSUSE had set up, and that worked just fine.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.720
So this is probably another reason,

25:39.720 --> 25:41.480
don't do it the way that I did.

25:41.480 --> 25:42.640
Don't think I would have run into this

25:42.640 --> 25:45.600
if I hadn't moved off the inner MFS and the Linode kernel that

25:45.600 --> 25:48.840
are specifically set up to handle the boot process.

25:48.840 --> 25:52.320
But other than that, it's just worked.

25:52.320 --> 25:55.000
I mean, I was, you know, I greeted with the system,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.640
had Kexec already there running, set up ready to go,

25:57.640 --> 26:00.400
which is great, not that I needed it anymore.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.480
And I was like, OK, what do I want to try with this?

26:02.480 --> 26:03.640
What do I normally do on a server?

26:03.640 --> 26:05.140
And of course, one of the first things

26:05.140 --> 26:09.200
we end up doing for JB tests are getting some containers running.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.240
I knew you were going to go the classic just go get Docker

26:12.240 --> 26:13.800
around, so I thought, well, I'm going

26:13.800 --> 26:15.240
to try Podman this time around.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.760
Because I was like, I'm pretty sure OpenSUSE just

26:16.760 --> 26:17.520
has that package.

26:17.520 --> 26:19.920
And I found some docs for getting containers going,

26:19.920 --> 26:21.360
getting rootless containers going,

26:21.360 --> 26:22.920
which is always neat with Podman.

26:22.920 --> 26:25.520
And I wanted to see if Tumbleweed had the Podman working

26:25.520 --> 26:27.320
with some of that Docker Compose socket support

26:27.320 --> 26:28.560
that they added recently.

26:28.560 --> 26:31.120
And of course, the first thing you got to do

26:31.120 --> 26:32.280
is install a darn package.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.840
I will say, getting Docker Compose,

26:34.840 --> 26:36.720
you'll probably touch on this, but it was kind of confusing

26:36.720 --> 26:37.520
in some ways.

26:37.520 --> 26:41.360
But I really like that they have the command not found

26:41.360 --> 26:43.360
helper installed, and that you're prompted by it

26:43.360 --> 26:45.520
if you try to run something that isn't there.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.640
That just need to happen once for me, where it was like, hey,

26:47.640 --> 26:49.280
you don't have that command, but you

26:49.280 --> 26:53.600
can run this to figure out which, you know, run cnf.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.000
And it'll tell you which packages

26:55.000 --> 26:56.400
you can install to get it.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.520
And I've used that so many times already just

26:58.520 --> 27:00.360
in the short time I've been playing with this.

27:00.360 --> 27:01.280
It's great.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.980
It's an interesting setup, because it's

27:02.980 --> 27:05.680
a little unique in some ways, being transactional,

27:05.680 --> 27:08.240
but also Podman instead of Docker.

27:08.240 --> 27:09.440
That's a fun combination.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.160
Did you run into any kind of snags?

27:11.160 --> 27:14.160
So the biggest thing is with the transactional updates,

27:14.160 --> 27:14.800
it works well.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.760
You're going to use the transactional dash update

27:16.760 --> 27:17.260
command.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.080
No surprise there, right?

27:19.080 --> 27:22.000
And they've got a managed page that the dash dash help menu

27:22.000 --> 27:23.920
is pretty normal, and they've got some stuff

27:23.920 --> 27:25.520
you can exec into a snapshot to make

27:25.520 --> 27:27.560
some other customizable changes, or you

27:27.560 --> 27:29.480
can run sort of a command you might expect to say,

27:29.480 --> 27:32.720
transactional update, package, install.

27:32.720 --> 27:34.840
And then it's going to go do all the stuff behind the scenes

27:34.840 --> 27:37.480
to create a new snapshot based on the previous one,

27:37.480 --> 27:40.840
set it all up, trute in there, run zipper inside that,

27:40.840 --> 27:43.480
get your packages installed, rejigger the system

27:43.480 --> 27:45.980
so that on your next boot, that's what you'll boot into.

27:45.980 --> 27:48.160
And that's the one part that I think

27:48.160 --> 27:50.280
is going to be a pretty big learning curve or something

27:50.280 --> 27:51.600
I needed to get used to.

27:51.600 --> 27:52.880
And I'm sure there's lots of tricks, right?

27:52.880 --> 27:54.560
I'm definitely new to this whole setup.

27:54.560 --> 27:58.280
But after each of your transactional updates,

27:58.280 --> 27:59.320
you got to reboot.

27:59.320 --> 28:01.320
And if you don't, or you want to like,

28:01.320 --> 28:04.000
I wasn't sure by default how to stack multiple updates

28:04.000 --> 28:06.160
without reboots in between all of them.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.440
And that I could see getting kind of annoying, at least

28:08.440 --> 28:10.880
for one-off machines.

28:10.880 --> 28:13.320
On a system where you're running some sort of configuration

28:13.320 --> 28:15.760
management or building images, you're not worrying about that.

28:15.760 --> 28:16.760
No big deal at scale.

28:16.760 --> 28:19.000
But for me, continuing to mess up,

28:19.000 --> 28:21.720
it was easy to me to be like, oh, I installed that package,

28:21.720 --> 28:24.020
and then I didn't realize that execing in there

28:24.020 --> 28:26.800
and messing about or installing a separate package

28:26.800 --> 28:29.840
before rebooting could actually overwrite the changes,

28:29.840 --> 28:31.920
or at least make it so that the snapshot, the way

28:31.920 --> 28:33.800
that they inherited from each other, was off.

28:33.800 --> 28:36.160
And what I rebooted into didn't actually have

28:36.160 --> 28:37.400
the commands I was expecting.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.040
Oh, I could totally see making that mistake.

28:39.040 --> 28:40.600
So it sounds like maybe you think

28:40.600 --> 28:42.720
we shouldn't go transactional for our server.

28:42.720 --> 28:43.440
Well, no.

28:43.440 --> 28:46.320
I just think if you do, you just got to kind of be all in.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.280
And maybe it takes some of your initial setup

28:48.280 --> 28:49.800
time or your play time longer.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.600
Or maybe you have a prototyping system that

28:51.600 --> 28:53.440
isn't transactional that you kind of learn on,

28:53.440 --> 28:54.520
so you've got it down.

28:54.520 --> 28:57.120
Because after that, like once I got Docker Compose and Podman

28:57.120 --> 28:59.720
installed, which really was just me learning the system enough

28:59.720 --> 29:01.640
to run the right command and install them both

29:01.640 --> 29:04.400
at the same time or install them and reboot in between,

29:04.400 --> 29:05.680
then it just worked.

29:05.680 --> 29:09.720
System CTL enabled the socket, and I got a Docker Compose

29:09.720 --> 29:11.240
project up and running no problem.

29:11.240 --> 29:14.800
So after that point, it's been a totally fine server.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.400
I wonder if we should use Podman in our deployment then.

29:17.400 --> 29:18.920
That's kind of what I was thinking.

29:18.920 --> 29:19.880
I'd be down for that.

29:19.880 --> 29:20.480
OK, then.

29:20.480 --> 29:21.480
I think we just committed.

29:21.480 --> 29:21.920
Let's try it.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.280
I mean, what's the worst that happens?

29:23.280 --> 29:24.020
We've got to back up.

29:24.020 --> 29:26.520
If we have to abandon ship, we'll abandon ship and fess

29:26.520 --> 29:27.720
up on the air, of course.

29:27.720 --> 29:28.680
But yeah, right?

29:28.680 --> 29:31.720
I mean, it's coming along, and we get fresh Podman

29:31.720 --> 29:33.840
with Tumbleweed, so let's take advantage of it.

29:33.840 --> 29:34.840
Yeah, I wonder if anybody out there

29:34.840 --> 29:37.760
knows of any major problems using Podman on Tumbleweed.

29:37.760 --> 29:39.800
I suppose let us know at linuxunplug.com

29:39.800 --> 29:41.440
slash contact before we do it.

29:41.440 --> 29:42.960
Brett, you had a pretty snappin' time,

29:42.960 --> 29:46.560
and you tried out the Plasma desktop being a Plasma

29:46.560 --> 29:47.360
gentleman yourself.

29:47.360 --> 29:49.560
How did your adventures in the Soos land go?

29:49.560 --> 29:51.120
I think they went fairly well.

29:51.120 --> 29:54.600
I tried to apply the exact same approach

29:54.600 --> 29:57.720
as I did with our Fedora 35 review

29:57.720 --> 29:59.480
that we did a few episodes ago.

29:59.480 --> 30:02.000
So I just stuck to the desktop, because that's

30:02.000 --> 30:02.840
most of what I know.

30:02.840 --> 30:04.680
I let you guys do all the crazy stuff.

30:04.680 --> 30:06.800
And I had all the same thoughts about the installer.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.680
It was kind of, well, everything we've already mentioned.

30:09.680 --> 30:12.160
What was really new to me and what I really wanted to dive

30:12.160 --> 30:15.280
into was the software updates.

30:15.280 --> 30:16.360
Ah, yeah.

30:16.360 --> 30:19.280
The whole reason to run Tumbleweed is for that.

30:19.280 --> 30:21.960
As far as I understand it thus far with the reading

30:21.960 --> 30:24.920
I've been doing and some help from various people

30:24.920 --> 30:29.920
is that ButterFS allows you to do some really nice sort

30:29.920 --> 30:31.920
of snapshotting stuff at boot.

30:31.920 --> 30:34.280
So you can install the rolling.

30:34.280 --> 30:36.360
So as far as I understand, it's a rolling release

30:36.360 --> 30:39.400
that is very well tested, which really

30:39.400 --> 30:41.080
appeals to me, as you know, Chris.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.520
And having those snapshots in there

30:42.520 --> 30:44.160
is nice, because my understanding

30:44.160 --> 30:49.480
is that it will take a snapshot on a system update.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.640
So you could, in theory, revert back.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.720
And yeah, I think it's using ButterFS and Snapper

30:53.720 --> 30:55.280
to do all of that on the back end.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.400
You have like a lot of different snapshot technologies

30:57.400 --> 30:59.400
out there, and we've touched on a couple of them.

30:59.400 --> 31:02.440
You have transactional updates, which are like entire images

31:02.440 --> 31:04.040
that you switch at boot.

31:04.040 --> 31:05.680
And then you have snapshots, which

31:05.680 --> 31:08.760
are file system snapshots that capture

31:08.760 --> 31:11.440
a current or certain state of the OS.

31:11.440 --> 31:13.560
And you have ZFS snapshots and ButterFS.

31:13.560 --> 31:14.600
It goes on and on and on.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.240
But yeah, ButterFS snapshots, and I

31:16.240 --> 31:18.320
think they're using a tool called Snapper.

31:18.320 --> 31:18.800
They are.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.720
That's what I read about thus far.

31:20.720 --> 31:22.920
But I guess either way, essentially what you need to know

31:22.920 --> 31:26.360
is there is a bit of an insurance policy

31:26.360 --> 31:27.600
when you're using this system.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.320
So unlike Arch, where it's rolling with no suspenders,

31:30.320 --> 31:31.760
this is rolling with suspenders.

31:31.760 --> 31:35.040
Yeah, and I have run Arch for a few years previously,

31:35.040 --> 31:38.280
and I moved away from that because of it

31:38.280 --> 31:41.080
felt inherently risky on a daily basis.

31:41.080 --> 31:43.260
And while that's fun, if you're trying

31:43.260 --> 31:46.000
to get stuff done on your main machine, that feels.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.800
Did it ever really actually bite you, though?

31:47.800 --> 31:48.660
Oh, yeah.

31:48.660 --> 31:49.320
Oh, it did.

31:49.320 --> 31:49.800
OK.

31:49.800 --> 31:50.400
All right, OK.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.280
And partly my fault, I think.

31:52.280 --> 31:55.840
Some of the ways I set it up with disk encryption and stuff

31:55.840 --> 31:57.480
led to some issues.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.480
So fair enough.

31:58.480 --> 31:59.560
Lots of learning there.

31:59.560 --> 32:01.520
But that was the whole point of running Arch at the time,

32:01.520 --> 32:02.360
was to learn.

32:02.360 --> 32:05.320
But having this snapshot functionality

32:05.320 --> 32:08.880
feels like I can dive into that full steam ahead again,

32:08.880 --> 32:11.340
which I've missed, but without, I don't know,

32:11.340 --> 32:13.280
without that feeling that I might just

32:13.280 --> 32:16.320
drown when I need to be floating and get stuff done.

32:16.320 --> 32:18.240
It just makes you feel a little more comfortable

32:18.240 --> 32:20.880
actually proceeding with updates and whatnot,

32:20.880 --> 32:22.280
like you're not dreading it.

32:22.280 --> 32:23.840
Yeah, and I noticed the more that I

32:23.840 --> 32:25.640
dove into how it worked in reading

32:25.640 --> 32:30.620
some of the documentation, the more this deeply curious

32:30.620 --> 32:35.120
and excited younger version of me started coming out.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.120
And I really, really appreciated that.

32:38.120 --> 32:43.120
I think that probably colors my testing of OpenSUSE,

32:43.120 --> 32:45.400
but in such a wonderful way.

32:45.400 --> 32:49.800
So I then decided to go a little crazy

32:49.800 --> 32:53.400
and set up my microphone and our recording for this episode

32:53.400 --> 32:56.340
on that test laptop, because I thought, what the heck,

32:56.340 --> 32:57.680
let's bring it to the next level.

32:57.680 --> 33:00.360
And maybe I'm going to throw this out there.

33:00.360 --> 33:05.040
If I'm considering maybe moving to this distribution

33:05.040 --> 33:08.700
as my main setup, may as well try it on the show, right?

33:08.700 --> 33:11.440
I didn't expect we'd be matchmakers today, Chris.

33:11.440 --> 33:12.160
Wow.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.160
Yeah, I know.

33:13.160 --> 33:15.200
And that's an interesting outcome of it.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.760
Wes, are you still on Tumbleweed now,

33:16.760 --> 33:18.920
or are you on your regular machine?

33:18.920 --> 33:20.960
Yes, yes, I am.

33:20.960 --> 33:23.920
So both of you are Tumbleweeding.

33:23.920 --> 33:24.680
I'm not.

33:24.680 --> 33:28.000
I actually still have my VM, so I'll get into going, though.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.160
Brent, did you get a chance at all to experience

33:31.160 --> 33:32.800
the essence of Yast?

33:32.800 --> 33:35.560
So as far as I understand from listening to,

33:35.560 --> 33:39.200
I did dive into a few talks at conferences.

33:39.200 --> 33:41.360
I wanted to get some of the history of OpenSUSE,

33:41.360 --> 33:44.560
because I just didn't have much experience with it.

33:44.560 --> 33:47.440
So I dove into a bunch of historical documentation

33:47.440 --> 33:49.080
and talks and stuff.

33:49.080 --> 33:52.360
And it sounds to me like Yast is controversial,

33:52.360 --> 33:54.400
or at least people didn't like it a long time ago

33:54.400 --> 33:55.280
or it didn't keep up.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.520
And apparently, as far as I understand,

33:57.520 --> 33:59.640
Yast 2 is kind of the thing we're dealing with now.

33:59.640 --> 34:01.600
And I got to say, it was really nice.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.440
I didn't have any issues with it.

34:03.440 --> 34:08.760
I did see some slightly confusing naming conventions.

34:08.760 --> 34:11.260
Like, for instance, there's an application

34:11.260 --> 34:14.360
called Yast Online Update, which it took me a long time

34:14.360 --> 34:15.480
to figure out what that did.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.360
I'm still a little confused about that.

34:17.360 --> 34:18.900
Apparently, it's used to get patches

34:18.900 --> 34:21.120
to correct and improve your existing installation.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.080
So maybe in a week or two, I'll figure that one out.

34:23.080 --> 34:25.200
But for the most part, yeah, it was great.

34:25.200 --> 34:26.400
Yeah, I think that's just the updater.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.120
But yeah, right, it is a weird.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.280
So I prefer to use Zipper on the command line myself.

34:30.280 --> 34:34.880
So yeah, I think it's a classic GUI tool versus command line

34:34.880 --> 34:36.440
tool kind of debate.

34:36.440 --> 34:37.520
We should talk about Zipper, though,

34:37.520 --> 34:39.880
because I feel like in the past, I was skeptical.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.560
But I kind of like it.

34:41.560 --> 34:43.340
I haven't really used it in anger yet.

34:43.340 --> 34:44.600
And admittedly, this most recent time

34:44.600 --> 34:47.060
has been kind of wrapped in the transactional update stuff.

34:47.060 --> 34:47.760
I don't know.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.600
What I have done with it recently, it hasn't been bad.

34:50.600 --> 34:51.760
Yeah, I agree.

34:51.760 --> 34:54.760
You know, my cards on the table here,

34:54.760 --> 34:58.680
it was the transition to Zipper that made me leave Soos.

34:58.680 --> 34:59.840
Way back when.

34:59.840 --> 35:01.280
I was just done.

35:01.280 --> 35:02.320
I was done at that point.

35:02.320 --> 35:05.320
There had been a couple of other package manager transitions.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.340
Plus, I was trying to use red carpet.

35:07.340 --> 35:12.000
And RPM dependency resolution was a real nightmare back then.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.400
And I was just done.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.200
And apt was a thing.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.400
Yum was a thing.

35:16.400 --> 35:20.700
And Mandrake had URPMI, which was also really nice.

35:20.700 --> 35:22.360
And so I was done when Zipper came along.

35:22.360 --> 35:26.840
But this time around, I found the Zipper cheat sheet

35:26.840 --> 35:27.960
that the project publishes.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.520
And I don't know if it's, I think it's current.

35:29.520 --> 35:30.080
But it worked for me.

35:30.080 --> 35:30.480
It's just great.

35:30.480 --> 35:31.920
I'll have a link in the show notes.

35:31.920 --> 35:32.840
It's just a PDF.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.960
Man, this is the way to go.

35:34.960 --> 35:37.640
And you know, I think what trips me up is I've

35:37.640 --> 35:39.720
been surprised that in some areas,

35:39.720 --> 35:41.640
they didn't adopt a more common syntax.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.180
Like, they use the word refresh instead of update,

35:44.180 --> 35:45.760
where if you use DNF and apt a lot,

35:45.760 --> 35:48.160
you're just DNF update, apt get update.

35:48.160 --> 35:50.640
But I would actually argue that the convention in apt

35:50.640 --> 35:52.120
seems a little awkward.

35:52.120 --> 35:54.840
I would assume it's only nice for you because it's familiar.

35:54.840 --> 35:57.040
But for someone coming at each fresh,

35:57.040 --> 35:59.680
I think refresh makes a lot more sense because you're right.

35:59.680 --> 36:01.320
In that sense, if you come at it clean.

36:01.320 --> 36:04.240
But you know what I think when we do user studies a lot, what

36:04.240 --> 36:06.880
we commonly see is that turns out people

36:06.880 --> 36:08.920
been using systems for a while now.

36:08.920 --> 36:10.920
And if something's been really popular,

36:10.920 --> 36:13.960
like say a start menu and a task bar and things like that,

36:13.960 --> 36:16.400
like those conventions become so well understood

36:16.400 --> 36:19.000
by the general population that if you want to provide them

36:19.000 --> 36:20.560
a low friction transition, you adopt

36:20.560 --> 36:22.920
some of those conventions, even if they aren't necessarily

36:22.920 --> 36:26.000
the ones you'd always come up with if you're starting anew.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.720
It's, you know, there's always, it's a balance and it works.

36:28.720 --> 36:29.200
It's fine.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.440
It's just once you know those little differences, right?

36:31.440 --> 36:33.400
And that's where I think that having the map,

36:33.400 --> 36:35.600
like the cheat sheet, that makes that really great.

36:35.600 --> 36:38.560
And then once you have that, I think it's a nice tool to use.

36:38.560 --> 36:40.360
It's got good display and output.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.200
It's quick.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.080
I'd say it's quicker than DNF.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.760
I liked it from that standpoint.

36:45.760 --> 36:48.080
But I do have that, like that old school,

36:48.080 --> 36:50.520
like I can't believe we're doing another package manager

36:50.520 --> 36:51.480
transition.

36:51.480 --> 36:53.760
That was actually one of the items

36:53.760 --> 36:57.040
I was most hesitant about in doing

36:57.040 --> 36:59.800
some of these distribution tests in the last few weeks

36:59.800 --> 37:01.480
is package management.

37:01.480 --> 37:02.880
I don't have that much, I actually

37:02.880 --> 37:04.680
don't have that much experience with them.

37:04.680 --> 37:07.000
I've used apt and Arch has forced

37:07.000 --> 37:09.240
me to do the Pac-Man thing for a while.

37:09.240 --> 37:12.920
But I didn't know any of the RPM based ones.

37:12.920 --> 37:17.400
And that, I have to admit, was the source of my biggest

37:17.400 --> 37:18.320
fears in all of this.

37:18.320 --> 37:21.240
I thought, jeez, if I just can't even update packages

37:21.240 --> 37:24.280
or anything like that, I'm going to look pretty silly online

37:24.280 --> 37:25.160
trying this stuff out.

37:25.160 --> 37:29.160
But it turns out they're all pretty friendly these days.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.480
And that wasn't my experience a decade ago

37:31.480 --> 37:33.320
when I played with all this stuff.

37:33.320 --> 37:36.720
So I was actually pleasantly surprised and continue

37:36.720 --> 37:37.760
to be impressed.

37:37.760 --> 37:39.880
You know, speaking from a desktop perspective too,

37:39.880 --> 37:43.200
like the last time I used SUSE pretty seriously,

37:43.200 --> 37:44.800
Flatpak and Flathub weren't a thing.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.160
And that makes a difference now too.

37:46.160 --> 37:48.160
Kind of changes the software availability story

37:48.160 --> 37:50.120
that used to be a big deciding factor

37:50.120 --> 37:51.160
between the distributions.

37:51.160 --> 37:52.080
Yeah, no kidding, right?

37:52.080 --> 37:54.040
Like there's this one layer of, I don't know,

37:54.040 --> 37:56.560
more server centric tooling and kind of like base system

37:56.560 --> 37:57.880
tooling that we're talking about.

37:57.880 --> 37:59.360
And of course, there's the open build service,

37:59.360 --> 38:01.280
which we haven't really talked about today.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.720
But you're right, like for just day

38:02.720 --> 38:06.280
to day, the dumb business applications I got to use,

38:06.280 --> 38:08.320
Flatpak has totally changed that.

38:08.320 --> 38:11.680
And it's probably in a fantastic way for us distro hoppers.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.520
And then on the server application side,

38:14.520 --> 38:18.120
using things like Podman and Docker

38:18.120 --> 38:22.080
means that how you run and install software

38:22.080 --> 38:24.080
has sort of been normalized.

38:24.080 --> 38:26.720
And so then you start looking at, OK,

38:26.720 --> 38:28.280
now what else differentiates a distro?

38:28.280 --> 38:30.280
Well, you know, now I'm kind of paying attention

38:30.280 --> 38:32.560
to the fact that I kind of like the way they set up

38:32.560 --> 38:34.080
the console by default. You know what?

38:34.080 --> 38:35.240
I kind of like that they're using

38:35.240 --> 38:36.560
ButterFS to do these snapshots.

38:36.560 --> 38:39.280
And you know, it's kind of handy that zippers quick,

38:39.280 --> 38:41.600
because when I do have to use the host system,

38:41.600 --> 38:44.240
I'd like every interaction to be as quick as possible.

38:44.240 --> 38:47.600
And so for my test setup, because I am also

38:47.600 --> 38:49.840
always kind of thinking long term about what

38:49.840 --> 38:53.360
my next build in Lady Joob's my RV is going to be.

38:53.360 --> 38:56.080
Right now, I'm very happy with Ubuntu 20.04

38:56.080 --> 38:57.520
on a couple of Raspberry Pis.

38:57.520 --> 38:58.520
It's been really good.

38:58.520 --> 39:00.400
But gosh, that's so LTS.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.840
How long can you last?

39:01.840 --> 39:02.680
I know.

39:02.680 --> 39:06.240
I'm always kind of shopping for the next thing.

39:06.240 --> 39:09.080
And for my workloads, a rolling OS

39:09.080 --> 39:10.320
wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing,

39:10.320 --> 39:13.080
because everything, again, on that is in a container.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.560
And the LTS has plenty of updates.

39:15.560 --> 39:16.760
So it's not like I don't need to log in

39:16.760 --> 39:19.040
and do updates all the time on the LTS.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.280
So I've thought, you know, what else?

39:20.280 --> 39:23.680
So CentOS Stream 9 is very high on my list.

39:23.680 --> 39:26.480
And Tumbleweed, or maybe Leap, but probably Tumbleweed,

39:26.480 --> 39:28.240
is also on that list.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.440
And so I was curious what their ARM image release is like,

39:30.440 --> 39:33.560
because some distributions really half-ass this.

39:33.560 --> 39:36.000
And some distributions treat it like a first-class citizen.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.320
Like, I've been very impressed with Fedora 35 ARM

39:40.320 --> 39:41.480
and the Ubuntu ARM.

39:41.480 --> 39:46.400
And now I am also very impressed by the OpenSUSE server ARM

39:46.400 --> 39:47.240
image.

39:47.240 --> 39:51.000
I felt like there was no penalty for being on an ARM box.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.040
I had a great experience.

39:52.040 --> 39:53.000
I booted up that ISO.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.280
I got it going.

39:54.280 --> 39:57.120
I almost went transactional server like US.

39:57.120 --> 39:58.280
I almost did.

39:58.280 --> 40:01.120
But there's a wiki post that explains some of the drawbacks.

40:01.120 --> 40:02.640
And I don't know how current that is.

40:02.640 --> 40:05.000
But I read through some of that, and I thought, hmm.

40:05.000 --> 40:05.740
No, I think I won't.

40:05.740 --> 40:07.320
But I'll link to that in the show notes if you're curious.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.320
Yeah, it's probably a lot, especially, like, as you say,

40:09.320 --> 40:10.960
you're still learning a new package manager.

40:10.960 --> 40:11.960
There's a lot going on that you don't

40:11.960 --> 40:14.120
understand about what's different than the Linux

40:14.120 --> 40:14.880
systems I know.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.480
I think adding, learning both of those at the same time,

40:17.480 --> 40:19.840
probably not the best idea.

40:19.840 --> 40:21.000
So that's why you did it.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
I love it.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.960
But yeah, I figured, yeah, OK, I won't.

40:23.960 --> 40:27.160
And I appreciated them making that kind of, you know,

40:27.160 --> 40:29.320
the drawbacks kind of very, very clear.

40:29.320 --> 40:31.920
And they weren't necessarily anything too serious.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.480
So I had set up a couple of hosts.

40:33.480 --> 40:37.520
I set one up as a Docker host, and I set up one as a Samba.

40:37.520 --> 40:38.520
So two virtual machines.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.100
I did all this in a VM.

40:40.100 --> 40:42.100
And the Docker host was interesting.

40:42.100 --> 40:42.840
I set it up twice.

40:42.840 --> 40:45.600
The first time I went through, I did it all by hand.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.480
You know, just what's it like, you know,

40:47.480 --> 40:49.520
I'm going to do this on my own and not look for any help

40:49.520 --> 40:51.720
and not ask anybody, you know, that stupid mentality.

40:51.720 --> 40:53.400
Well, I decided to do that.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.280
And of course, I had trouble figuring out

40:55.280 --> 40:57.840
which version of Docker Compose packages to install.

40:57.840 --> 40:59.160
I loaded up Yast.

40:59.160 --> 41:01.040
I went into the, you know, the software manager,

41:01.040 --> 41:04.340
because I wasn't fully, I hadn't found the cheat sheet yet.

41:04.340 --> 41:06.760
And so I go in there, and I search for Docker.

41:06.760 --> 41:08.000
And I find the Docker packages.

41:08.000 --> 41:08.880
OK, great.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.760
And then, like, in the Yast software manager,

41:10.760 --> 41:12.520
in the InCurses terminal interface,

41:12.520 --> 41:15.040
when you select a package, you get, like, a check.

41:15.040 --> 41:17.600
But then they have a dash, and they have a slash.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.400
And I used to know what those mean, but I have no idea.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.400
I'm pretty sure I know what a check is.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.700
So I got them checked.

41:24.700 --> 41:26.320
And then I went over to the search,

41:26.320 --> 41:29.920
and I type in Docker Compose, and nothing comes up.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.200
Well, that's weird.

41:31.200 --> 41:33.760
So I type in Docker dash compose.

41:33.760 --> 41:35.040
Three results.

41:35.040 --> 41:35.520
Oh, OK.

41:35.520 --> 41:36.320
Well, I didn't search as hard.

41:36.320 --> 41:38.080
I needed a dash, OK.

41:38.080 --> 41:39.200
Three results, though.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.260
Well, what are these three results?

41:41.260 --> 41:43.080
And they are three different results

41:43.080 --> 41:45.320
that correspond to different versions of Python

41:45.320 --> 41:48.660
that you could hypothetically have installed on your system.

41:48.660 --> 41:51.680
And I don't, at that moment, while I'm in that search,

41:51.680 --> 41:53.400
I don't know what version of Python.

41:53.400 --> 41:54.880
I assume it's the latest, because I'm

41:54.880 --> 41:55.760
on a rolling distro.

41:55.760 --> 41:57.880
So I choose the one that has the highest number.

41:57.880 --> 41:59.720
I mean, that's how I'm building my server at this point,

41:59.720 --> 42:01.280
is that one's a high number.

42:01.280 --> 42:03.880
I'll choose that one.

42:03.880 --> 42:05.280
And I hit Install.

42:05.280 --> 42:07.480
And I go to run a Docker compose file.

42:07.480 --> 42:09.280
I say, you know, Docker compose up.

42:09.280 --> 42:10.620
And I get a whole bunch of errors,

42:10.620 --> 42:12.960
because I had wrongfully assumed that the service would

42:12.960 --> 42:14.240
automatically be started.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.360
So the second time, and I got everything up and going.

42:16.360 --> 42:17.720
I eventually figured it out.

42:17.720 --> 42:19.920
Got my user added to the group, all that kind of stuff.

42:19.920 --> 42:21.280
The second time through, though, I

42:21.280 --> 42:23.400
wanted to see what the documentation was like,

42:23.400 --> 42:25.040
what the community guides were like.

42:25.040 --> 42:26.440
And I went out, and I found, I think

42:26.440 --> 42:27.700
it's actually on their official wiki.

42:27.700 --> 42:29.400
But if it's not, it's really well done.

42:29.400 --> 42:31.780
That explains, very briefly and very simply,

42:31.780 --> 42:33.120
what zipper commands to get.

42:33.120 --> 42:35.840
And then the user group add commands and all that stuff.

42:35.840 --> 42:38.120
And so I, the second time through,

42:38.120 --> 42:40.040
using this concise guide, I probably

42:40.040 --> 42:44.600
had a Docker environment up in about two minutes, at the most.

42:44.600 --> 42:47.380
So it was really a lot smoother going that way.

42:47.380 --> 42:51.080
Also, the Samba box was a total cinch to get going.

42:51.080 --> 42:52.920
I used to build these all the time on Sless,

42:52.920 --> 42:55.560
so that was kind of my comfort zone.

42:55.560 --> 42:57.920
But what I noticed about Yast, they've

42:57.920 --> 42:59.040
dialed it down a little bit.

42:59.040 --> 43:01.200
It does less stuff.

43:01.200 --> 43:04.000
I think, as the general Linux ecosystem,

43:04.000 --> 43:05.960
the kernel does more systemd as a thing.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.720
There's just more stuff happening,

43:07.720 --> 43:09.320
and more things are automatic.

43:09.320 --> 43:11.760
They've kind of paired Yast back a little bit.

43:11.760 --> 43:13.160
And that's, I think, actually really, I should say,

43:13.160 --> 43:14.960
I think that's actually good on them.

43:14.960 --> 43:15.760
I think it's a good approach.

43:15.760 --> 43:16.640
Keep it lean on me.

43:16.640 --> 43:19.040
Well, you're adapting, too, to the ecosystem now.

43:19.040 --> 43:21.560
As you say, there is just somewhat more of a shared

43:21.560 --> 43:23.080
platform that you can tap into.

43:23.080 --> 43:25.160
So if you don't have to reinvent it yourself, don't.

43:25.160 --> 43:27.160
I sort of feel like they may have adapted too far

43:27.160 --> 43:29.800
with the Samba configuration.

43:29.800 --> 43:33.840
Wes, in the past, man, you could set up so much stuff

43:33.840 --> 43:34.400
for Samba.

43:34.400 --> 43:36.640
You could even make the damn thing an Active Directory

43:36.640 --> 43:39.040
controller, or an NT4 domain controller, all right there

43:39.040 --> 43:39.560
in Yast.

43:39.560 --> 43:41.280
Oh, just right from Yast, whoa.

43:41.280 --> 43:42.120
Yeah.

43:42.120 --> 43:42.920
Dang.

43:42.920 --> 43:45.160
Now it's like, now you go in there,

43:45.160 --> 43:47.280
you set your work group name, and you

43:47.280 --> 43:50.640
set if the services are enabled and if they start automatically.

43:50.640 --> 43:51.800
And that's it.

43:51.800 --> 43:53.680
That's all it does now.

43:53.680 --> 43:56.160
So everything else is in SambaConf, and that's fine.

43:56.160 --> 43:58.200
That actually is probably, maybe, the best way to do it.

43:58.200 --> 43:59.600
Because you don't want people messing with this stuff,

43:59.600 --> 44:01.560
unless they, I suppose, they know what they're doing.

44:01.560 --> 44:03.560
But gosh, I don't want to edit SambaConf.

44:03.560 --> 44:05.040
I don't want to.

44:05.040 --> 44:07.200
I liked the both systems, just default.

44:07.200 --> 44:09.800
I thought their hard drive layout config was smart,

44:09.800 --> 44:12.160
and I went with it, and I used ButterFS.

44:12.160 --> 44:16.120
And I had a much nicer and much smoother experience

44:16.120 --> 44:17.720
than my previous desktop experience.

44:17.720 --> 44:18.840
It kind of braced me for.

44:18.840 --> 44:21.080
I was sort of braced to fight this thing.

44:21.080 --> 44:24.680
And I had two servers set up and going in one evening,

44:24.680 --> 44:26.800
and then I just blew it away and did it again just

44:26.800 --> 44:29.440
to take a different approach at it.

44:29.440 --> 44:32.520
And I think a big part of it was getting that zipper cheat

44:32.520 --> 44:36.740
sheet, and there is a lot of good documentation

44:36.740 --> 44:37.720
out there now.

44:37.720 --> 44:39.680
And now I'm deploying applications

44:39.680 --> 44:42.880
via containers instead of a big old pile of RPMs

44:42.880 --> 44:46.180
and install shell scripts, which always was

44:46.180 --> 44:47.800
problematic for me on SUSE.

44:47.800 --> 44:50.420
And it's like kind of just now a non-issue.

44:50.420 --> 44:52.120
So I actually found the experience better

44:52.120 --> 44:55.200
than I was expecting, and I'm feeling a lot better

44:55.200 --> 44:57.520
about deploying it on our main server now.

44:57.520 --> 44:59.120
Yeah, I think this is going to work.

44:59.120 --> 45:01.200
I mean, if anything, we're going to screw it up.

45:01.200 --> 45:03.120
But I think it's going to work.

45:03.120 --> 45:09.000
JupiterGarage.com, the random swag bags are back.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.440
We have two different swag bags now.

45:11.440 --> 45:14.040
So what's in here is like stickers

45:14.040 --> 45:17.920
of the shows, retro items from past Jupiter broadcasting

45:17.920 --> 45:21.640
swag, whatever, like events or sales or whatever.

45:21.640 --> 45:23.980
And then also we have some bonus stuff from the road trip

45:23.980 --> 45:26.320
that we're giving out on the meetups along the road trip.

45:26.320 --> 45:28.880
And then there's a second journal for just $5 more.

45:28.880 --> 45:31.440
You get all that stuff, but also you

45:31.440 --> 45:35.640
get the Jupiter journal, which is a really nice low-key journal.

45:35.640 --> 45:38.240
It's a spiral bound, so you can lay it open and flat

45:38.240 --> 45:40.640
with lined paper in there so you can just take notes.

45:40.640 --> 45:43.480
And it's got a nice, classy rocket on the front

45:43.480 --> 45:44.520
that's imprinted into it.

45:44.520 --> 45:45.680
It looks real good.

45:45.680 --> 45:47.480
And you see, you get the swag bag with that journal in there

45:47.480 --> 45:48.680
for just $5 more.

45:48.680 --> 45:52.320
Or you can go grab a journal if you just want the journal.

45:52.320 --> 45:53.820
And then you can choose your color.

45:53.820 --> 45:55.760
We have them in blue or gray.

45:55.760 --> 45:59.720
And there is about a dozen of each bag left.

45:59.720 --> 46:01.000
So there's not a lot.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.980
And generally, people put a lot of the orders

46:02.980 --> 46:06.440
in the first day or so after the show's out.

46:06.440 --> 46:08.840
So if you're listening, you want to grab one, do grab it.

46:08.840 --> 46:11.080
The jacket that's up there will be up for a while

46:11.080 --> 46:12.880
because that's print-on-demand.

46:12.880 --> 46:14.520
And it is the Bearded Tux Bomber.

46:14.520 --> 46:16.840
And it's just something I wanted to do for the winner.

46:16.840 --> 46:18.360
It's like your nice going-to-town jacket.

46:18.360 --> 46:19.160
It's got another.

46:19.160 --> 46:22.520
I'm really big now on just the low-key, subtle design.

46:22.520 --> 46:26.080
It doesn't need to shout, but if people know, they know.

46:26.080 --> 46:28.280
And so the Bearded Tux is one of my absolute favorites.

46:28.280 --> 46:29.840
That's all up at jupitrgarage.com.

46:29.840 --> 46:31.880
And I should mention, our members,

46:31.880 --> 46:34.120
our core contributors, get a discount on that jacket.

46:34.120 --> 46:36.120
We got a little bit of feedback this week

46:36.120 --> 46:39.040
from our last episode on command line love.

46:39.040 --> 46:42.280
ChunkyPie, who I love that name, he wrote in.

46:42.280 --> 46:44.960
He says, I think the biggest draw to the GUI

46:44.960 --> 46:46.800
is the visual output.

46:46.800 --> 46:49.120
The drawback to the command line is the visual output

46:49.120 --> 46:52.840
as well that a non-power user sees.

46:52.840 --> 46:54.800
So he says, for non-super users, I

46:54.800 --> 46:57.040
don't believe the command line syntax, the input,

46:57.040 --> 46:57.760
is the problem.

46:57.760 --> 47:00.960
A person can easily be taught and can understand

47:00.960 --> 47:05.560
the concept of command, name, option, and argument syntax.

47:05.560 --> 47:09.240
The problem lies in what they receive as the output

47:09.240 --> 47:11.520
when they type in a command and press Enter.

47:11.520 --> 47:13.600
Try to explain the output and what

47:13.600 --> 47:17.600
all the columns of an ls-l command means to a regular user.

47:17.600 --> 47:19.560
He continues, I believe the solution

47:19.560 --> 47:22.720
to making the command line easier for non-super users

47:22.720 --> 47:25.040
is to change or have an option to change

47:25.040 --> 47:27.040
the output of the command line.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.480
If the output is something that's

47:28.480 --> 47:31.320
visually easier to understand, then the barrier for entry

47:31.320 --> 47:33.400
would be much lower for normal users.

47:33.400 --> 47:37.200
He also adds, PS Chris, I envy your RV as a home life.

47:37.200 --> 47:39.560
Keep living the dream.

47:39.560 --> 47:41.880
First of all, very good points on the command output.

47:41.880 --> 47:45.440
So I think I do have some more thinking to do about my position

47:45.440 --> 47:47.680
and I do appreciate that input.

47:47.680 --> 47:50.560
I also, though, have to acknowledge

47:50.560 --> 47:55.280
I find it so incredibly valuable that the commands I learned

47:55.280 --> 48:00.320
when I was just a wee lad, nearly 30 years ago now,

48:00.320 --> 48:02.280
I find it awesome that I am still

48:02.280 --> 48:03.760
using some of those same commands

48:03.760 --> 48:06.080
or a slight tweak on those commands.

48:06.080 --> 48:10.000
And that the time I invested to learn that

48:10.000 --> 48:12.240
has paid dividends for 20 plus years.

48:12.240 --> 48:15.840
And I can't think of any gooey experience

48:15.840 --> 48:17.160
where I can say the same.

48:17.160 --> 48:19.600
So I don't necessarily think the position's invalidated.

48:19.600 --> 48:21.360
I just think it needs some thinking.

48:21.360 --> 48:23.840
For the RV, I think it's a little bit more

48:23.840 --> 48:27.960
for the RV full time thing, we do really love the freedom.

48:27.960 --> 48:32.880
But just to balance it all out, before I came into work today,

48:32.880 --> 48:35.360
I'm flying the drone up over the RV

48:35.360 --> 48:37.880
because there was 60 mile per hour

48:37.880 --> 48:40.240
winds blowing through the Pacific Northwest yesterday.

48:40.240 --> 48:42.040
And we were under a tree.

48:42.040 --> 48:44.640
It's been trimmed, but the top of it is not.

48:44.640 --> 48:47.920
And it just started disintegrating and just fall.

48:47.920 --> 48:50.400
I mean, it was just like disintegrating all over Lady

48:50.400 --> 48:52.480
Joops because she was parked right underneath it.

48:52.480 --> 48:56.280
And I mean, bam, bam, smack, clump, thump.

48:56.280 --> 48:59.040
You're just like you're hearing your solar panels take hits.

48:59.040 --> 49:02.520
And when we just got Lady Joops, we

49:02.520 --> 49:04.840
had parked somewhere near, well, there's

49:04.840 --> 49:06.200
trees everywhere in the Pacific.

49:06.200 --> 49:07.880
There's nowhere that doesn't have trees.

49:07.880 --> 49:09.880
We parked near a tree, and a branch

49:09.880 --> 49:13.440
actually came through our roof very early on.

49:13.440 --> 49:16.040
Yeah, so we have literal scars.

49:16.040 --> 49:18.600
Yeah, really actual scars that are there still.

49:18.600 --> 49:22.560
We had to seal it up, but the holes are still there.

49:22.560 --> 49:23.840
So I flew the drone up this morning

49:23.840 --> 49:25.360
to take a look at the damage.

49:25.360 --> 49:27.640
Not a single branch up there.

49:27.640 --> 49:30.200
A twig that got caught under one of the solar panels.

49:30.200 --> 49:32.120
Not a crack in a single panel.

49:32.120 --> 49:33.760
It's like it all just rolled off.

49:33.760 --> 49:35.120
It just all rolled.

49:35.120 --> 49:36.920
Maybe the rain and the wind pushed it all off.

49:36.920 --> 49:37.640
It blew it all off.

49:37.640 --> 49:40.080
But oh my god, I can't believe we survived that

49:40.080 --> 49:41.560
without branches up there.

49:41.560 --> 49:43.280
I thought, honestly, I'd be going up

49:43.280 --> 49:47.280
this weekend with a blower and some gloves

49:47.280 --> 49:49.160
and throwing branches off it.

49:49.160 --> 49:51.640
But we did discover a crack in one of our seals.

49:51.640 --> 49:54.160
So my wife, Adia, as I'm down here recording,

49:54.160 --> 49:55.680
was up there fixing that.

49:55.680 --> 49:58.000
So it's not all freedom and road trips.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.440
There is work to be done.

49:59.440 --> 50:01.760
Wes, I thought you could take this next one from Ryan

50:01.760 --> 50:05.040
that touches on the same topic of our command line love.

50:05.040 --> 50:07.840
Ryan writes in, I started typing gibberish at the command

50:07.840 --> 50:10.320
prompt almost 40 years ago.

50:10.320 --> 50:12.560
I enjoy it, I understand the appeal,

50:12.560 --> 50:15.320
and I really see the potential, and I admire the elegance.

50:15.320 --> 50:17.360
But I have to agree with Linus Tech Tips

50:17.360 --> 50:19.320
that the command line will not have

50:19.320 --> 50:21.760
a prominent place in the future of computing

50:21.760 --> 50:22.840
for regular people.

50:22.840 --> 50:24.760
I see friends and family type at a command prompt

50:24.760 --> 50:27.400
about as often as I see them pump the hood of their car

50:27.400 --> 50:29.200
and change their own oil.

50:29.200 --> 50:31.240
I know it's cliche, but sometimes I

50:31.240 --> 50:34.560
look to sci-fi for a glance at what could be.

50:34.560 --> 50:36.800
And when Geordi of Star Trek The Next Generation

50:36.800 --> 50:39.320
was adjusting the lighting in his quarters for a date,

50:39.320 --> 50:40.880
he didn't sit down at a command prompt

50:40.880 --> 50:43.760
and type in how many lumens he wanted.

50:43.760 --> 50:45.400
And he didn't pull up in Elcar's gooey

50:45.400 --> 50:47.720
and adjust the lights with a dimmer switch.

50:47.720 --> 50:49.760
Because the Enterprise had the newest version of Home

50:49.760 --> 50:53.520
Assistant installed, he was able to say, computer,

50:53.520 --> 50:54.840
dim the lights.

50:54.840 --> 50:55.760
No, that's too low.

50:55.760 --> 50:57.600
Raise it a little more, a little more.

50:57.600 --> 50:59.800
Now play some relaxing music.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.520
Or in the episode where they were trying

51:01.520 --> 51:03.680
to find out what element was causing random ship

51:03.680 --> 51:06.520
malfunctions, the engineers didn't pull up a terminal

51:06.520 --> 51:08.640
and start typing SQL statements.

51:08.640 --> 51:10.000
They asked the computer to access

51:10.000 --> 51:12.400
a list of possible elements, and they slowly

51:12.400 --> 51:15.280
eliminated them with more verbal commands.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.200
I think the future of computing will be something

51:17.200 --> 51:19.760
like that for ordinary people.

51:19.760 --> 51:21.920
But fear not, at least not on my account.

51:21.920 --> 51:24.240
I don't believe the command line is going away entirely

51:24.240 --> 51:25.840
anytime soon.

51:25.840 --> 51:28.360
Can you think of any highly successful gooey apps that

51:28.360 --> 51:30.860
don't have a command line or at least an accessible API

51:30.860 --> 51:32.720
somewhere underneath them?

51:32.720 --> 51:35.440
I think there will probably always be some kind of back end

51:35.440 --> 51:38.720
with more options and flexibility offered in gooey's

51:38.720 --> 51:41.920
accessible with a command prompt of one form or another.

51:41.920 --> 51:42.760
It's a good take.

51:42.760 --> 51:43.760
It's got a good point.

51:43.760 --> 51:45.520
I mean, when he's throwing the Star Trek facts at me,

51:45.520 --> 51:46.520
I can't argue with that.

51:46.520 --> 51:51.400
I would wonder perhaps the engineers at the Starbase

51:51.400 --> 51:53.020
that installed the computer, maybe they

51:53.020 --> 51:54.720
were using the command line to get things going.

51:54.720 --> 51:57.340
And then the developers who programmed the interfaces

51:57.340 --> 52:00.600
for Geordi to command the luminance of the lights,

52:00.600 --> 52:02.360
perhaps they use the command line.

52:02.360 --> 52:05.480
And what I think this probably gets back to is

52:05.480 --> 52:07.840
who is the new user for Linux?

52:07.840 --> 52:11.160
And in my estimation, the new user for Linux

52:11.160 --> 52:14.680
is one that's technical and one that is perhaps

52:14.680 --> 52:17.480
an engineer, a developer, a tinker, a hobbyist,

52:17.480 --> 52:18.680
an enthusiast.

52:18.680 --> 52:20.640
And of course, you have users who

52:20.640 --> 52:23.840
have been set up with the system, companies, and friends

52:23.840 --> 52:25.640
and family, and schools.

52:25.640 --> 52:26.480
Absolutely.

52:26.480 --> 52:29.480
But there's distributions that are purpose built for that.

52:29.480 --> 52:31.920
But for the general tech community,

52:31.920 --> 52:34.880
people who would consider themselves pro users, somebody

52:34.880 --> 52:38.120
who would consider themselves savvy in technology,

52:38.120 --> 52:44.440
I think it is not that it's too hard or it's too cryptic.

52:44.440 --> 52:46.240
I think it's truly a mindset thing.

52:46.240 --> 52:49.760
I think it's a cultural mindset about how

52:49.760 --> 52:50.960
we view the command line.

52:50.960 --> 52:53.600
And again, now for new users or people like friends and family

52:53.600 --> 52:56.840
that don't have any interest in how the computer works,

52:56.840 --> 52:59.200
if really for most people, they probably

52:59.200 --> 53:00.920
shouldn't have to use the command line.

53:00.920 --> 53:03.040
It should all be available to them some way.

53:03.040 --> 53:05.380
Well, and it makes me think of, as you often touch on,

53:05.380 --> 53:07.560
technology doesn't usually just go away.

53:07.560 --> 53:08.640
I mean, yeah, in some cases.

53:08.640 --> 53:10.400
But we'll probably have all these things.

53:10.400 --> 53:11.600
We'll have standard GUIs.

53:11.600 --> 53:12.600
We'll have command lines.

53:12.600 --> 53:14.480
We'll have audio interfaces, perhaps

53:14.480 --> 53:17.200
some sort of nonverbal interface in the future.

53:17.200 --> 53:20.360
Can watch you dance and interpret that somehow.

53:20.360 --> 53:21.920
I guess my fear is, I just hope we

53:21.920 --> 53:23.920
don't lose sight of some of the design elements that

53:23.920 --> 53:25.760
go into the GUI side.

53:25.760 --> 53:29.240
Touching on the car analogy there,

53:29.240 --> 53:30.600
some of the reasons some people who

53:30.600 --> 53:32.480
might want to change or do more maintenance on their car

53:32.480 --> 53:33.720
can't these days is because it's not really

53:33.720 --> 53:34.960
designed with that in mind.

53:34.960 --> 53:36.720
It's made more difficult than it needs

53:36.720 --> 53:37.920
to be to service it.

53:37.920 --> 53:40.080
And for now, in Linux, we don't have that.

53:40.080 --> 53:41.880
And I just don't want to see that disappear.

53:41.880 --> 53:43.520
Not that I think it necessarily will.

53:43.520 --> 53:44.600
Great way to put it, Wes.

53:44.600 --> 53:49.120
That's exactly it, is I don't change the oil in my car.

53:49.120 --> 53:52.300
But I would not want the ability for me to do it taken away.

53:52.300 --> 53:54.440
In fact, it's already kind of a pain in the ass.

53:54.440 --> 53:59.680
And the funny thing about the RV is the damn thing's so big.

53:59.680 --> 54:02.240
And it's more from an industrial kind of legacy

54:02.240 --> 54:05.120
that it's actually easier for me.

54:05.120 --> 54:09.480
And I do change the oil on my RV because it's more accessible

54:09.480 --> 54:11.440
to me and it's easier to understand it.

54:11.440 --> 54:12.960
It's not simple necessarily.

54:12.960 --> 54:14.160
I mean, it is simple.

54:14.160 --> 54:16.200
And I think that's actually an interesting more

54:16.200 --> 54:17.200
I think about that is you're right.

54:17.200 --> 54:19.600
That is kind of what we're on the precipice of right now

54:19.600 --> 54:22.240
and maybe why this has come up ultimately.

54:22.240 --> 54:24.400
I know that we have more to say in the mumble room.

54:24.400 --> 54:27.400
So what I'll do is I'll try to bring it up in the post show.

54:27.400 --> 54:31.400
But we've got to clean up around here.

54:31.400 --> 54:32.800
Thank you to our core contributors

54:32.800 --> 54:34.720
over at unpluggedcore.com.

54:34.720 --> 54:35.720
Your direct support means that we

54:35.720 --> 54:38.260
don't have to load the show up with any random sponsor who's

54:38.260 --> 54:39.720
willing to sponsor us.

54:39.720 --> 54:42.720
I have the flexibility to just be flexible and make sure

54:42.720 --> 54:45.760
that I have the flexibility to be picky, I guess

54:45.760 --> 54:47.000
is what I'm trying to say.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.400
And I don't have to rush into anything.

54:48.400 --> 54:50.360
And that's really thanks to our member support.

54:50.360 --> 54:51.840
That's huge.

54:51.840 --> 54:53.600
And it can only grow from there, right?

54:53.600 --> 54:55.840
Like one day it could truly replace an entire sponsor.

54:55.840 --> 54:59.840
So thank you to everybody who supports us at unpluggedcore.com.

54:59.840 --> 55:01.520
You get a limited ad feed as a thank you

55:01.520 --> 55:04.280
and also the full live feed, which today

55:04.280 --> 55:06.680
is worth the price of admission alone.

55:06.680 --> 55:08.520
In fact, maybe we should talk after the show.

55:08.520 --> 55:10.040
Maybe that should be released because I

55:10.040 --> 55:12.360
think that was a really valuable conversation

55:12.360 --> 55:13.520
we had in the pre-show.

55:13.520 --> 55:14.480
Huge, actually.

55:14.480 --> 55:17.040
So there's things that happen in the pre-show just organically

55:17.040 --> 55:19.680
because we have really interesting people showing up

55:19.680 --> 55:22.720
and sharing their perspectives in our mumble room.

55:22.720 --> 55:25.040
So go over there, check it out, unpluggedcore.com.

55:25.040 --> 55:26.400
We also want to hear from you.

55:26.400 --> 55:27.840
Contact the show, linuxunplugged.com slash

55:27.840 --> 55:29.240
contact.

55:29.240 --> 55:32.240
And of course, our telegram is jupiterbroadcasting.com

55:32.240 --> 55:33.720
slash telegram.

55:33.720 --> 55:36.720
And if you're in the BC area, let Brent know.

55:36.720 --> 55:39.560
I mean, BC is a big place, but I have recently

55:39.560 --> 55:42.480
discovered that we have a few listeners

55:42.480 --> 55:43.880
in my immediate area.

55:43.880 --> 55:47.240
And so I'm in Eastern BC near Cranbrook.

55:47.240 --> 55:50.000
And so I was thinking we might just

55:50.000 --> 55:53.040
do a little mini micro meetup, maybe

55:53.040 --> 55:54.040
the beginning of December.

55:54.040 --> 55:58.280
So if anyone is in the area at all and interested,

55:58.280 --> 55:59.480
please get in touch.

55:59.480 --> 56:01.560
linuxunplugged.com slash contact,

56:01.560 --> 56:02.880
and we'll see what we can do.

56:02.880 --> 56:06.400
I might even have some gifts to give away.

56:06.400 --> 56:09.200
And just to be clear, if you are in BC and you don't show up,

56:09.200 --> 56:12.160
we will find you.

56:12.160 --> 56:13.720
Join the love plug.

56:13.720 --> 56:15.920
You know what, if you do that, I'll let it slide.

56:15.920 --> 56:17.600
It happens every Sunday.

56:17.600 --> 56:19.200
You can get the mumble room details

56:19.200 --> 56:21.560
at linuxunplugged.com slash mumble, noon Pacific,

56:21.560 --> 56:24.600
jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for the mumble

56:24.600 --> 56:26.760
lifetime, mumble virtual live lifetime,

56:26.760 --> 56:31.160
and for our show live stream.

56:31.160 --> 56:32.400
I have a really special pick.

56:32.400 --> 56:34.360
And it is a command line tool.

56:34.360 --> 56:36.960
Now, all the picks are not going to be command line tools,

56:36.960 --> 56:39.360
but it seemed appropriate for this week.

56:39.360 --> 56:42.520
And this one, if we have never covered this before,

56:42.520 --> 56:45.520
it is an egregious error that will be corrected.

56:45.520 --> 56:47.160
Shame on us.

56:47.160 --> 56:52.040
It's called mp4 grep, a command line tool that searches audio

56:52.040 --> 56:55.360
and video files like grep.

56:55.360 --> 56:56.720
And so it's not just for mp4.

56:56.720 --> 56:58.360
Even though it's called mp4 grep,

56:58.360 --> 57:02.640
it'll also search mp3 files, aug files, webm, mov, wav files.

57:02.640 --> 57:04.100
I'm going to try this after the show

57:04.100 --> 57:05.920
because I just found this a little bit ago.

57:05.920 --> 57:08.520
This could be awesome for, like, what episode did we say this

57:08.520 --> 57:10.600
word, or did we say this thing?

57:10.600 --> 57:11.880
This sounds so great.

57:11.880 --> 57:14.160
How have we not known about this for years?

57:14.160 --> 57:17.360
This sounds amazing and kind of a little bit like wizardry.

57:17.360 --> 57:19.040
Do you have any idea how it's doing this?

57:19.040 --> 57:21.600
It's using something called VOSK, V-O-S-K.

57:21.600 --> 57:23.440
I'm feeling like I'm just discovering, like,

57:23.440 --> 57:25.240
this entire universe of stuff that exists.

57:25.240 --> 57:28.520
And, you know, VOSK is a speech recognition toolkit.

57:28.520 --> 57:30.600
And so I kind of feel like it's Wes's fault

57:30.600 --> 57:32.160
because this is his area.

57:32.160 --> 57:33.720
We're always talking about this stuff.

57:33.720 --> 57:35.080
So he should have said something.

57:35.080 --> 57:35.640
I know.

57:35.640 --> 57:36.720
I don't know why we didn't see it.

57:36.720 --> 57:38.760
Probably because, unlike many of our picks,

57:38.760 --> 57:40.120
this is not written in Rust.

57:40.120 --> 57:42.280
No, this is a Java app, actually.

57:42.280 --> 57:42.760
You're right.

57:42.760 --> 57:43.100
You're right.

57:43.100 --> 57:44.080
That's got to be it.

57:44.080 --> 57:45.560
I will say, this is super exciting.

57:45.560 --> 57:48.520
I kind of hack around this sometimes by, you know,

57:48.520 --> 57:50.480
if it's a video on YouTube or you can upload it

57:50.480 --> 57:52.760
to your own YouTube and get auto subtitles that way,

57:52.760 --> 57:55.480
you can then fetch the SRTs and search.

57:55.480 --> 57:57.480
Because I use this a lot, or I would use this

57:57.480 --> 58:00.000
and will use this for just trying to figure out time codes

58:00.000 --> 58:01.040
or, like, I know that was in a video,

58:01.040 --> 58:03.280
but this video doesn't really have chapters or something.

58:03.280 --> 58:04.520
Where did they talk about that?

58:04.520 --> 58:05.320
Where did they talk about that?

58:05.320 --> 58:07.120
But if I can do it with an open source tool,

58:07.120 --> 58:08.880
that is so much more flexible.

58:08.880 --> 58:10.800
And, you know, what's nice is VOSK,

58:10.800 --> 58:13.020
which I'm sure I'm butchering the pronunciation on

58:13.020 --> 58:16.000
because it's the first time I've ever even seen the word.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.540
What's nice is that it's all offline.

58:18.540 --> 58:20.760
So you're not using, like, Google Transcription

58:20.760 --> 58:21.520
or whatever.

58:21.520 --> 58:23.920
You know, you're just running it right there on your machine.

58:23.920 --> 58:26.680
It looks like it comes with a lightweight English model

58:26.680 --> 58:28.360
for that, you know, speech recognition.

58:28.360 --> 58:30.240
But VOSK has a whole bunch of other ones

58:30.240 --> 58:32.160
that you can go swap in if you are looking

58:32.160 --> 58:33.320
at some non-English sources.

58:33.320 --> 58:34.800
So this looks so handy.

58:34.800 --> 58:35.360
Yeah, really.

58:35.360 --> 58:36.800
And it's a command line tool, too.

58:36.800 --> 58:38.560
So we've got to give a little command line

58:38.560 --> 58:40.440
love for our command line picks out there.

58:40.440 --> 58:44.480
Although I have to say, I don't normally do this,

58:44.480 --> 58:46.560
but I wanted this to be a command line thing.

58:46.560 --> 58:48.880
But I found such an awesome GUI app

58:48.880 --> 58:51.720
that I'm going to tell you guys about next week.

58:51.720 --> 58:52.920
You tease.

58:52.920 --> 58:54.600
I know, I know, I know.

58:54.600 --> 58:56.640
Go find our friends at Cloud Guru on social media.

58:56.640 --> 58:58.040
They're just slash the Cloud Guru

58:58.040 --> 59:00.240
at pretty much any place that is a legit social media

59:00.240 --> 59:03.000
platform out there, you know, like the YouTubes or, I mean,

59:03.000 --> 59:04.420
I think that's social media, right?

59:04.420 --> 59:06.040
I think I'd consider that social media.

59:06.040 --> 59:08.120
Twitters, the Facebooks, the Instagrams, you know,

59:08.120 --> 59:10.840
just slash the Cloud Guru for that social media.

59:10.840 --> 59:13.080
And you can follow this year podcast

59:13.080 --> 59:15.200
at Linux Unplugged on Twitter, if that's your thing,

59:15.200 --> 59:16.320
and at Jupiter Signal.

59:16.320 --> 59:18.200
I don't know if anybody's doing that anymore.

59:18.200 --> 59:19.560
But if you want to and get information

59:19.560 --> 59:21.840
about what's going on, that's where you do it.

59:21.840 --> 59:24.640
But what you really ought to do, Chris's pro tip,

59:24.640 --> 59:27.280
invest in your RSS ecosystem.

59:27.280 --> 59:29.320
Build your own system.

59:29.320 --> 59:31.800
And then go over to JupiterBroadcasting.com,

59:31.800 --> 59:33.520
find each one of our podcasts, and subscribe.

59:33.520 --> 59:34.880
We have an all shows feed.

59:34.880 --> 59:36.120
Then you just get all the shows.

59:36.120 --> 59:37.680
You know, then you get the full package.

59:37.680 --> 59:39.200
Linux Action News, which is giving you

59:39.200 --> 59:40.600
all the info you need.

59:40.600 --> 59:43.600
You're getting the breakdowns in a nice, concise type package.

59:43.600 --> 59:45.180
You're getting the Coder Radio, where

59:45.180 --> 59:48.000
we're doing more analysis on the entire tech industry

59:48.000 --> 59:49.040
with a developer bent.

59:49.040 --> 59:51.120
And then, of course, you're getting self-hosted,

59:51.120 --> 59:53.160
where Alex and I are talking about awesome free software

59:53.160 --> 59:55.240
projects that you can self-host all the time,

59:55.240 --> 59:56.760
and the hardware that makes you do that,

59:56.760 --> 59:58.480
and including I have a really cool device

59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.040
for that show next week.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.520
So why not get the all show feeds?

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.680
Then you get that, you get all the good stuff.

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.120
And then you come over here live,

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.600
and you've really got the complete package.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.440
Join us next week.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:10.280
We do it live at jblive.tv on a Tuesday.

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.600
See you next week.

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.280
Same bad time, same bad station.

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.240
12 Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.960

Links to what we talked about today,

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.560
and things you can try out, and our pick,

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.360
and the SUSE tips, and all of that,

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:28.480
at linuxunplug.com slash 432.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.640
Thank you so much for joining us on this week's episode

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.300
of the Unplugged program.

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:33.400
Remember those tuxes?

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.520
Oh, man.

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:35.880
I'm glad I remembered.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.240
Won't you remember?

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.480
Tuxes.party.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.280
Go vote.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.840
We've got a big show coming up, and we need your input.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.280
And perhaps you can fight against the lizard revolution.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.400
Anyways, really, thank you so much for joining us.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.560
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:00:49.560 --> 01:01:16.120
Thank you so much for watching, and we'll see you next week.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:32.240
OK, JBtitles.com, let's go do our boats.

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.720
We've got to go figure out a title for this thing,

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.240
and then we've got to ship it off.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.320
Parker, I know you had something you wanted to jump in on

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.240
during the show.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:39.720
Oh, yeah.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.400
I was going to say that, going back to how the command line

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.800
should be more friendly to newer Linux users,

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:49.960
the command line, we might want it to maybe make

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.120
it more human-speakable.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:56.760
So instead of commands like sudo apt-get update or whatever,

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.600
have commands like just update.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.800
So that it would, when we tell people

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.080
to go into the command line, it's just easier to say,

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.440
yeah, just go in there, type update,

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:06.680
and it'll update your system.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.240
Right.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.360
Or something along the lines of saying admin override update

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:11.920
or something.

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.840
Basically, if you want to still have the sudo type elevation

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:19.280
request, prefix it with words people can say.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.400
Exactly.

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.320
Sudo is super user do.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.520
So admin override or something along those lines

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.040
that somebody can understand.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:43.600
Just effin' do what I say, machine.
