00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
You guys see this TechCrunch is running the story about Avast did this report this morning

00:05.280 --> 00:09.720
that reveals a new form of malware on the Google Play Store, which begins to display

00:09.720 --> 00:13.460
advertisements disguised as warning messages to end users when they unlock their Android

00:13.460 --> 00:15.240
smartphone.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.240
So like, I guess it waits?

00:17.240 --> 00:24.040
Wouldn't that be just a different version of like any other website than just on mobile?

00:24.040 --> 00:27.440
Because I remember like some websites try to freak you out and just...

00:27.440 --> 00:31.480
Well, I think the particular one here is that you're not opening an app.

00:31.480 --> 00:33.400
It's just happening as soon as you unlock the device.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.400
That's what it says.

00:36.400 --> 00:41.680
They show a card game that it's embedded in, an IQ test game, a history app were also found

00:41.680 --> 00:42.680
to be infected.

00:42.680 --> 00:47.360
Well, yes, it's like as if people haven't learned by now, don't install random IQ test

00:47.360 --> 00:48.360
apps.

00:48.360 --> 00:49.360
Well, I think they haven't.

00:49.360 --> 00:50.360
Yeah.

00:50.360 --> 00:51.360
So here's a video of it.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.360
Let's see what happens.

00:52.360 --> 00:53.360
Let's find out.

00:53.360 --> 00:57.400
So they got an Android device here and they say, okay, now I'll unlock it.

00:57.400 --> 01:01.160
Oh, when they say unlock it, they don't mean unlock the phone.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.760
They mean unlock the screen.

01:04.760 --> 01:08.480
So when you unlock the screen, it brings up you an urgent prompt to do something at the

01:08.480 --> 01:11.240
Google play store and then it gets your stuff.

01:11.240 --> 01:12.240
Okay.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.840
So I misread unlock is actually like unlocking the device, but they just mean disabling the

01:15.840 --> 01:17.000
screen protection.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Okay.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.060
That is much more, that is much, that, okay.

01:20.060 --> 01:21.060
That's a bigger problem.

01:21.060 --> 01:22.060
That's going to hit a lot more people.

01:22.060 --> 01:24.120
I'm slightly confused with the difference between unlocking the phone and unlocking

01:24.120 --> 01:25.120
the phone is.

01:25.120 --> 01:28.480
Well, unlocking the screen just to wake it up versus like unlocking the phone to move

01:28.480 --> 01:31.000
it to a different carrier or like rooting it.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Right?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Right.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Yeah.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
So it's just when you enter your pin code.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Or slide a little thing, it comes up and yeah.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Hmm.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.360
I didn't know that Google ever had urgent warnings or something.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.360
No, I don't.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.360
I guess it's all.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.360
I need to update software.

01:47.360 --> 01:48.680
It normally just shows up as a notification.

01:48.680 --> 01:51.200
I guess users probably wouldn't know that though.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.200
I just can't fathom.

01:52.200 --> 01:56.480
I mean, I, I don't know what it is, but I just can't fathom why people switch distro.

01:56.480 --> 02:02.000
I mean, I get it if you're a distro reviewer, I get it if you are, well, I get it if you've

02:02.000 --> 02:06.680
got ADHD or some other medical condition that forces you to like must have change, must

02:06.680 --> 02:07.680
have change.

02:07.680 --> 02:13.160
I get that, but I can't for the other 90%, I can't understand why people do it.

02:13.160 --> 02:17.840
I know a lot of people change distros because of the experience they had inside of a distro.

02:17.840 --> 02:23.520
I don't know, I can't change so much that I, yeah.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.200
Distro hopping makes no sense to me.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.200
It's got to be.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.680
I always try to settle on a distro, but if something happens, then I might switch.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.280
It's got to be the grass is greener thing.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.080
You know, you get frustrated or something just isn't quite right.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.800
It's not quite how you want it.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.760
You know, in this case, Unity is great, but now Eric's having problems with compiz and

02:38.760 --> 02:41.040
maybe he keeps having problems with compiz and something wears him down.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.680
He starts thinking, gosh, you know, I'd really like to try this.

02:43.680 --> 02:46.760
And so I think it's like a grass is greener kind of thing.

02:46.760 --> 02:53.080
It's partially that, but for me, it's also a matter of, okay, there's something not working

02:53.080 --> 02:56.320
right in this case, but it works right over here, so let me try that for a while, see

02:56.320 --> 02:57.320
how I like it.

02:57.320 --> 03:02.460
Right, but in your house, if you didn't like the wallpaper in the bathroom, you don't knock

03:02.460 --> 03:06.160
the entire house down and build a new one and then wallpaper the bathroom.

03:06.160 --> 03:07.160
You don't?

03:07.160 --> 03:08.160
You fix the wallpaper in the bathroom.

03:08.160 --> 03:10.440
Well, no, I just switch out the furnace.

03:10.440 --> 03:17.960
I find that it's because the current distro I'm on doesn't actually reach my expectations

03:17.960 --> 03:23.760
and I just want to move to another one.

03:23.760 --> 03:27.600
The other thing with me is I just like to try it out, see what it's like, basically

03:27.600 --> 03:32.080
because, and that's one of the things that is cool about being a distro hopper and being

03:32.080 --> 03:37.840
a producer for this network, I can offer a lot of valid input based on a plethora of

03:37.840 --> 03:38.840
knowledge.

03:38.840 --> 03:43.600
Here's the undisputable facts, all distributions have little wiggle points that people don't

03:43.600 --> 03:47.000
like that drive them crazy and make them want to use a different distribution.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.040
Ergo, everyone should just use Arch, fix the problems that don't work for them, and enjoy

03:52.040 --> 03:54.360
the master race distro.

03:54.360 --> 04:03.160
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's jonesing for that new Raspberry

04:03.160 --> 04:04.160
Pi.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.320
My name is Chris.

04:05.320 --> 04:06.320
And my name is Matt.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.120
Hey there Matt, I'm not normally the guy that gets into these really small gadgets, but

04:10.120 --> 04:16.920
when they're talking three to six times the performance, maybe I could throw Mate on that,

04:16.920 --> 04:20.920
you know, maybe even go, I'm just thinking, you never know, so now I kind of want one

04:20.920 --> 04:21.920
for 35 bucks.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.400
We're going to talk more about it in the second half of the show.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.880
It looks like a pretty cool gadget, and of course we've got folks in the mumble room

04:26.880 --> 04:30.680
that are all about them Raspberry Pis, so we'll get their take on it.

04:30.680 --> 04:35.240
But before we get to that in the show this week, we're going to get a little recap of

04:35.240 --> 04:36.240
Fossdom.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.160
Unfortunately, and maybe this will be the last time, I don't know, I'll see after I

04:39.160 --> 04:40.560
get the report.

04:40.560 --> 04:45.280
We weren't able to make it out to Fossdom, but that is across the pond, and it is a great

04:45.280 --> 04:49.660
open source conference, and Poppy and others in the mumble room made it, and they're going

04:49.660 --> 04:51.000
to give us their update.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.560
I think I'm going to be totally jelly too, so that's cool.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.520
I think that's going to make me go next year, but we'll find out.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.240
So I think it's going to be a good show, Matt.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.240
Nice.

04:58.240 --> 05:02.080
We've got a lot of stuff to cover, and we also got some surprisingly great feedback this

05:02.080 --> 05:03.080
week.

05:03.080 --> 05:07.680
I was like, I don't know, I don't know if I really want to do feedback, and then I saw

05:07.680 --> 05:09.720
this stuff, and I was like, okay, we've got to talk about this.

05:09.720 --> 05:14.760
So before, just to make our first email a little more poignant, I want to talk about

05:14.760 --> 05:20.260
a development that's recently occurred, and it's been talked about in our Linux action

05:20.260 --> 05:21.260
share subreddit a bit.

05:21.260 --> 05:26.920
It's not technically Linux news, but you'll see why I want to bring this up, but it's

05:26.920 --> 05:31.140
come out that Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are reportedly paying the ad block extension

05:31.140 --> 05:35.840
that you might have in your browser to allow their ads to pass through ad blocks filter

05:35.840 --> 05:36.840
software.

05:36.840 --> 05:41.100
The confidential details were conferred by the Financial Times in a paper that came out

05:41.100 --> 05:43.840
on Tuesday that we were recording this.

05:43.840 --> 05:48.760
So I mention that because that brings us to our first email.

05:48.760 --> 05:51.080
So to cover our first email, let's bring in our Mumble Room.

05:51.080 --> 05:52.080
Hey, Mumble Room.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.080
Time appropriate greetings, guys.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.080
Hello.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.080
Hello.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.080
Hello.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.200
There's lots of people.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.200
I'm hungry for pie.

05:58.200 --> 05:59.200
It is a lot.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.720
So yeah, we will get the pie.

06:00.720 --> 06:03.440
So guest one wrote in specifically addressing the Mumble Room.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.120
It says, hello, everyone reading this email.

06:05.120 --> 06:09.660
During Linux Unplugged 77, the Mumble Room commented that ad block is heavy, and I'm

06:09.660 --> 06:11.660
here to present you with a solution.

06:11.660 --> 06:16.840
It's called uBlock, pronounced uBlock, and it's a you-decide-what enters your browser.

06:16.840 --> 06:21.840
uBlock supports Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari, and it's licensed under the GPL3.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.040
And he links us to it on GitHub.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.880
So I just wanted to pass that along to the audience.

06:25.880 --> 06:32.280
I'm not a big fan of ad blocks because A, people have got to get paid, and B, if that's

06:32.280 --> 06:36.140
how people want to represent their work and their website, then I think I should be able

06:36.140 --> 06:38.960
to take that into my judgment about their property.

06:38.960 --> 06:42.400
And when I block the ad, sometimes I don't see some of that, and I don't see some of

06:42.400 --> 06:45.580
the decisions they're making from a content standpoint.

06:45.580 --> 06:51.240
And so I make maybe the incorrect judgment, not to point out and single out our buddy,

06:51.240 --> 06:53.840
Mr. Michael, over at Ferronix.

06:53.840 --> 06:57.760
But I had been a user, I've been a reader of Ferronix for a while with, sorry Michael,

06:57.760 --> 07:03.160
but with ad block turned on, and I kind of had a rethinking of this, and I thought, boy,

07:03.160 --> 07:04.160
I really shouldn't do that.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.880
You know, the man deserves to eat, and I'm reading his stuff.

07:07.880 --> 07:15.400
So I disabled my ad blocker on Ferronix, and I was so taken aback by pop-up ads and cover-up

07:15.400 --> 07:16.400
ads.

07:16.400 --> 07:20.000
I really haven't gone back much anymore, just because it was so off-putting.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.600
And I felt like that gave me a different impression of the website when I had ad block on versus

07:23.600 --> 07:28.160
when I had it off, enough that it changed my opinion about visiting the site.

07:28.160 --> 07:33.240
Well, I can kind of give you my perspective on it, both as a publisher and as someone

07:33.240 --> 07:35.440
that visits websites.

07:35.440 --> 07:40.000
So I've worked with, so I guess the long and short of it comes down to this.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.440
I will take ad block and whitelist any site that I plan on visiting on a regular basis.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.680
I want to support them, I dig them, they're great.

07:48.680 --> 07:52.040
Now if it's a website that I want to visit on a regular basis that is going to pollute

07:52.040 --> 07:54.680
me with crap, then that gets a little sticky.

07:54.680 --> 07:59.560
I may, in fact, just ad block them and figure, hey, I'll support them in other ways that

07:59.560 --> 08:01.680
we'll find something else to have happen.

08:01.680 --> 08:05.460
Maybe I'll promote them or talk about their stuff or some other way of supporting them.

08:05.460 --> 08:10.800
But ad blocking software is a tool that allows us to choose how we want to interpret our

08:10.800 --> 08:11.800
content.

08:11.800 --> 08:17.320
The problem is that, especially in the tech community, ads like banner ads and AdSense

08:17.320 --> 08:20.920
ads and things like that aren't terribly effective.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.240
They're historically not.

08:22.240 --> 08:25.600
They're very effective in non-tech circles, but in tech circles they're pretty, it's pretty

08:25.600 --> 08:26.600
hit and miss.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.600
Right.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.600
I kind of just tune them out.

08:28.600 --> 08:29.600
Yeah.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.600
People want engagement advertisement.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.880
I mean, well, they don't necessarily want advertisement, but they tend to respond better

08:32.880 --> 08:33.880
to that.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.640
So anytime you've got something on a webpage blinking at you, especially with pop-ups,

08:36.640 --> 08:37.640
I mean, come on.

08:37.640 --> 08:38.640
Right?

08:38.640 --> 08:39.640
Yeah.

08:39.640 --> 08:40.640
Nobody needs that nonsense.

08:40.640 --> 08:41.640
No.

08:41.640 --> 08:42.640
It's a bad experience.

08:42.640 --> 08:43.640
So anything you can do to block that.

08:43.640 --> 08:44.640
Yeah, let's get rid of it.

08:44.640 --> 08:45.640
Get it out of here.

08:45.640 --> 08:46.640
Heaven's Revenge, you had some comment on the uBlock project itself.

08:46.640 --> 08:47.640
Yes.

08:47.640 --> 08:50.520
I've been using uBlock ever since it was coded up.

08:50.520 --> 08:51.520
I love it.

08:51.520 --> 08:56.440
It uses half the RAM of Adblock Plus, and it gives a lot of preset block lists in their

08:56.440 --> 08:57.760
configuration.

08:57.760 --> 09:03.560
And it actually helps pages load a couple of milliseconds, maybe 150 milliseconds faster

09:03.560 --> 09:04.960
than when you're using Adblock Plus.

09:04.960 --> 09:05.960
No kidding.

09:05.960 --> 09:06.960
Yeah.

09:06.960 --> 09:07.960
I'm going to check that out.

09:07.960 --> 09:13.520
They say, here's their philosophy, uBlock is not an ad blocker, it's a general purpose

09:13.520 --> 09:14.520
blocker.

09:14.520 --> 09:19.280
uBlock blocks ad search support of the Adblock Plus filter syntax, but it can work with custom

09:19.280 --> 09:20.280
rules and filters.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.280
That's really interesting.

09:21.280 --> 09:25.120
Yeah, it's completely compatible with all the Adblock syntax, and I recommend it here

09:25.120 --> 09:26.120
quite often.

09:26.120 --> 09:27.120
Wow.

09:27.120 --> 09:30.280
It actually says that the overall memory footprint is less than with no blocker running.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.760
How can they claim that?

09:32.760 --> 09:36.280
It's because when you actually go and you block things, and it isn't triggered by it.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.280
Oh, sure.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.280
Doesn't have to load it.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.280
Makes sense.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.280
Yeah, exactly.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.280
Yeah, right.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.280
And way less CPU usage, too.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.520
Yeah, well, Adblock has gotten big.

09:44.520 --> 09:45.680
I'll give you that.

09:45.680 --> 09:46.680
So uBlock it is.

09:46.680 --> 09:50.520
Well, not only that, but it sounds like they've completely sold out for what they were trying

09:50.520 --> 09:51.520
to do to begin with.

09:51.520 --> 09:52.520
Yeah.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.520
And these guys got lots of graphs, lots of statistics.

09:54.520 --> 09:55.520
Yeah, they do.

09:55.520 --> 09:56.520
I'm generally a bad person.

09:56.520 --> 09:57.520
I just block everything.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.960
Well, I just installed it, and I'm really impressed.

09:59.960 --> 10:00.960
This is, wow.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.800
It's also really easy to block things.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.800
You don't have to right click on loads of menus.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.960
You just have to click on that giant power button, and it blocks that site.

10:07.960 --> 10:13.600
It stops blocking that site for you instead of you having to go through all these settings.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.080
So uBlock sounds like it's a hit.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.080
It's a little bit unusual.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.080
Oh, this is awesome, dude.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.080
Yeah, you got to check this out.

10:18.080 --> 10:21.280
If you want to create your own custom filter, you'll get used to it.

10:21.280 --> 10:24.720
It's really different when you make your custom filter.

10:24.720 --> 10:25.720
But other than that, it's good.

10:25.720 --> 10:26.720
Tyler, I wanted to give you a chance to chime in.

10:26.720 --> 10:27.720
Oh, I recommend it anyway.

10:27.720 --> 10:28.720
Oh, yeah.

10:28.720 --> 10:32.760
I just wanted to add, you know, sometimes I feel you don't even need an Adblocker to

10:32.760 --> 10:34.520
get rid of the annoying stuff.

10:34.520 --> 10:38.440
Just block Flash from the get-go and block certain scripts.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.240
That's not a bad catch-all for sure.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.240
Yeah.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.000
All right.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Christian wrote in.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Check this out, Matt.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
How cool is this?

10:46.000 --> 10:48.200
And then he says, I'm from Vivaldi, and I want to talk.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.360
We were talking about the Vivaldi browser last week, because I'm a long-time Jupyter

10:51.360 --> 10:54.600
broadcasting fan, which is super cool.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.720
And I listen to all your tech shows as soon as they come out the door.

10:56.720 --> 11:00.160
I also happen to work for Vivaldi here in the US, although I'm a Norwegian.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.980
We're a company with developers and business people all over the world, but I'm located

11:02.980 --> 11:06.400
outside of Boston with a couple other employees of Vivaldi.

11:06.400 --> 11:10.220
Before Vivaldi, I worked in Opera since the end of the last century, which is also when

11:10.220 --> 11:14.320
I installed Linux for the first time, and I've never looked back at any other OS.

11:14.320 --> 11:17.920
We are, of course, very excited about launching Vivaldi, which is the browser we hope Opera

11:17.920 --> 11:19.080
would become.

11:19.080 --> 11:23.360
And Linux is important to us as both as other OSs some people use and our own.

11:23.360 --> 11:27.000
Keep up the good work, and make sure to be always supporting Linux.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.200
How cool is that?

11:28.200 --> 11:29.200
That is so awesome.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.200
I love that.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.320
And I love the fact that he reached out like that.

11:31.320 --> 11:32.320
Yeah.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.880
Christian, we'll see if we can't sync up and maybe have you on a future show to talk about

11:34.880 --> 11:36.380
what you guys are doing.

11:36.380 --> 11:40.320
And maybe if you can, talk about some of the interesting things about developing the browser

11:40.320 --> 11:41.320
for Linux.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.400
I'd be pretty curious about that.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.400
So I'm really glad to email this.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.400
I'm glad I caught it, too.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.400
It's awesome.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.400
Because you never know.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.720
And, of course, we want your emails, too.

11:48.720 --> 11:52.360
Go over to jupyterbroadcasting.com, click the contact link, and choose Linux Unplug from

11:52.360 --> 11:53.360
the dropdown.

11:53.360 --> 11:56.840
We have one more quick email and then two shout-outs to get to, but first, I want to

11:56.840 --> 11:59.680
tell you about something amazing, and that's Linux Academy.

11:59.680 --> 12:05.060
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplug to get our special Linux Unplugged discount.

12:05.060 --> 12:08.320
They want to give the Linux users a special discount because they're super passionate

12:08.320 --> 12:09.320
Linux users.

12:09.320 --> 12:12.400
That's where they were Linux Unplugged got started.

12:12.400 --> 12:16.360
It's a resource for you to use to further your own education, and the reason why I think

12:16.360 --> 12:20.020
Linux Academy is something specifically for our audience to consider is because if you

12:20.020 --> 12:24.780
are going out in the field of anything around Linux or any major open source technologies

12:24.780 --> 12:31.040
like OpenStack or even AWS, there's training in a lot of places, but none of them are like

12:31.040 --> 12:35.920
Linux Academy because Linux Academy was created by Linux users themselves who are crazy passionate.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.640
They considered launching a podcast network and then decided, well, Jupyter Broadcasting

12:39.640 --> 12:40.920
has got that down.

12:40.920 --> 12:41.920
So let's do something else.

12:41.920 --> 12:45.480
Let's do education, and they have developers that they brought in and educators they brought

12:45.480 --> 12:46.480
in.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.200
In fact, they have live streams with the educators, which is a great experience.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.280
You can ask those questions in real time.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.560
They have so many amazing courses for you to take.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.540
I like to talk about some of the newer ones because I think they're really on the cutting

12:55.540 --> 12:58.280
edge of the latest, coolest technology in Linux, the stuff that you probably want to

12:58.280 --> 13:03.080
keep your skill set fresh on anyways, which is another really great benefit of Linux Academy,

13:03.080 --> 13:07.400
but what I'll talk about, what I've started doing is I just started taking the Ruby on

13:07.400 --> 13:08.400
Linux courseware.

13:08.400 --> 13:13.640
And that's another thing I love about Linux Academy is a lot of the online educational

13:13.640 --> 13:18.940
resources out there, you could go learn Ruby from other places, right, and what's it going

13:18.940 --> 13:19.940
to tell you to do?

13:19.940 --> 13:23.760
It's going to tell you how to set up your Mac to do Ruby development, but that doesn't

13:23.760 --> 13:24.760
apply to me, right?

13:24.760 --> 13:29.160
But Linux Academy is designed by Linux users for Linux users.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.960
So everything's for Linux users.

13:30.960 --> 13:37.380
So it's getting set up and developing in Ruby on the Linux desktop, right?

13:37.380 --> 13:38.800
That closes that gap.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.360
That makes it so much more useful for me and I look at that and I say, okay, well I'm going

13:41.360 --> 13:44.600
to take five and a half hours to learn Ruby.

13:44.600 --> 13:45.920
I can wrap my brain around that.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.240
I get that.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.660
That is an achievable goal, something that I can attack.

13:49.660 --> 13:52.400
It's not this big nebulous thing, how the hell am I going to learn Ruby?

13:52.400 --> 13:56.380
Oh, I'm going to learn Ruby because Linux Academy has coursewares on it and it's going

13:56.380 --> 13:58.000
to take me five and a half hours.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.560
That's how I'm going to learn Ruby.

13:59.560 --> 14:02.640
That is kind of the confidence and direction that I need to actually get off my butt and

14:02.640 --> 14:03.640
do it.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.920
And they have learning plans where you can set your availability so depending on how much

14:05.920 --> 14:10.200
time you have free, the courseware will automatically adjust to that and send you reminders for

14:10.200 --> 14:11.200
that.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.200
Think about that.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.200
That's crazy.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.200
Cool.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.520
And you can download the study guides on the go so you can read when you have a little

14:15.520 --> 14:19.440
bit of extra time including like the walkthrough stuff so you can listen to it as a podcast

14:19.440 --> 14:21.280
which is really handy if you're in the car.

14:21.280 --> 14:24.240
Why not spend some of that time when you're done listening to your JB content, go into

14:24.240 --> 14:25.680
education mode.

14:25.680 --> 14:28.560
Switch from one type of Linux content to another type of Linux content.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.640
Your brain's already going to be in that gear.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.640
It's a really cool service.

14:31.640 --> 14:34.800
I want you to go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.400
We got that special discount for you.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.160
You'll see why you want the discount once you check them out.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.520
Go try out some of their courses.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.640
You can pick from seven plus Linux distributions.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.980
The courseware will match that distribution.

14:44.980 --> 14:48.360
The labs when they spin up virtual machines for you which is a really cool system.

14:48.360 --> 14:51.240
I got a little bit of the inside scoop on how it works too so I'm pretty impressed from

14:51.240 --> 14:54.600
like a system administration design standpoint too like how they have some of this stuff.

14:54.600 --> 14:57.280
It's damn impressive because they're really passionate about it.

14:57.280 --> 14:58.280
So I can respect that.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.680
I know like what I love is like okay the courseware, guess what?

15:00.680 --> 15:04.020
You need a virtual server, they just spin it right up on whatever Linux distribution

15:04.020 --> 15:05.020
you chose.

15:05.020 --> 15:06.020
It's good to go.

15:06.020 --> 15:07.020
You get an address on there.

15:07.020 --> 15:08.020
You can SSH from your desk.

15:08.020 --> 15:11.840
You know so you get really great performance while you're working in the lab environment.

15:11.840 --> 15:15.560
It's crazy cool because they get you and they get Linux.

15:15.560 --> 15:20.080
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the

15:20.080 --> 15:22.040
Linux unplugged program.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.480
Love hearing the success stories too so keep sending those in as well.

15:24.480 --> 15:25.480
Those are great.

15:25.480 --> 15:26.480
All right.

15:26.480 --> 15:29.080
So I wanted to just cover one more email.

15:29.080 --> 15:32.200
It comes in from Chuck and this is kind of exciting.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.360
We've been kind of kicking back and forth.

15:34.360 --> 15:38.840
Different production software for Linux and of course Ardour gets mentioned all the time

15:38.840 --> 15:41.560
as Audacity, Okan Audio got mentioned.

15:41.560 --> 15:46.540
But something really high-end, multi-track, do mixing, do audio like a music kind of stuff.

15:46.540 --> 15:49.200
So Chuck writes and he says you mentioned Ardour being a little cumbersome.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.200
He says I agree.

15:50.200 --> 15:54.620
I've used it for years but when you need to do high-level production, you can't beat the

15:54.620 --> 15:58.760
latest offering from Bitwig and he links me to it and I'm going to bring this up here

15:58.760 --> 15:59.760
in a second.

15:59.760 --> 16:00.760
He says it's amazing.

16:00.760 --> 16:05.320
It's like cleaning up podcast, making production music, live DJ sessions by piping mix into

16:05.320 --> 16:08.680
it and piping that out to IDJC.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.320
Just something worth checking into.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.080
It does have a hefty price tag.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.120
I thought okay, this might be interesting.

16:14.120 --> 16:21.280
What kind of, is this like some sort of like weird old like XUI kind of app for audio editing

16:21.280 --> 16:22.640
and because I hear a lot of this.

16:22.640 --> 16:23.640
I hear a lot of this.

16:23.640 --> 16:24.920
Oh, you got to check this one out.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.600
It's really, it's a good one.

16:26.600 --> 16:27.600
And then it's never.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.600
It looks like 1995.

16:28.600 --> 16:29.600
Yeah.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.600
It's never a good one.

16:30.600 --> 16:31.600
No, man.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.600
This is a good one.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.760
I'm checking out.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.520
They have a blog post up about their next version.

16:36.520 --> 16:41.200
The UI looks amazing and there's a little bit of a video here I'm going to play and

16:41.200 --> 16:43.520
I'll just play just a little bit for the audio listeners.

16:43.520 --> 16:44.520
Don't worry.

16:44.520 --> 16:45.520
It won't go too long.

16:45.520 --> 16:46.520
But it's pretty cool and it gives you an action.

16:46.520 --> 16:49.720
If you're watching the video, it gives you a chance to see the UI in action which is pretty

16:49.720 --> 16:50.720
sweet.

16:50.720 --> 17:02.040
So it's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, it's called Bitwig Studio.

17:02.040 --> 17:03.040
Now here comes the UI.

17:03.040 --> 17:10.880
So there's the recording UI.

17:10.880 --> 17:14.320
Now you got, I don't know for those of you watching the video version, this is a super

17:14.320 --> 17:20.960
pro level UI that easily, easily matches Pro Tools or Apple's Logic easily.

17:20.960 --> 17:21.960
Wow.

17:21.960 --> 17:22.960
Wow.

17:22.960 --> 17:23.960
That's actually, wow.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.240
I actually want to look into this.

17:25.240 --> 17:26.240
Yeah, me too.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.240
I'm geeking out right now.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.720
Yeah, this is, I'm looking at some of the audio stuff.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.120
It's just so sweet.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.000
So Bitwig Studio.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.600
This looks like one of the coolest audio editors I've ever seen on any platform.

17:35.600 --> 17:38.480
So I'm going to give it a look probably later this week.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.200
Do they have a demo?

17:40.200 --> 17:41.360
I hope so.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.360
I'm sure they do.

17:42.360 --> 17:43.360
Yeah.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.360
There's a demo on the page.

17:44.360 --> 17:45.360
Yeah.

17:45.360 --> 17:48.080
Anytime, any big ticket item like this in software always has a demo.

17:48.080 --> 17:49.440
They just have to to survive.

17:49.440 --> 17:50.440
But that's just, wow.

17:50.440 --> 17:51.440
Take my money.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.440
Yeah, take my money.

17:52.440 --> 17:53.440
I know, right?

17:53.440 --> 17:54.440
Should we see how much it is?

17:54.440 --> 17:56.000
Let's see if we can find out.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Let's see.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.120
Oh, it's on sale.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.120
So let's take a look.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.120
Let's see.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.120
It's on sale, guys.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.120
Jeez.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.960
Oh, actually it's doable.

18:03.960 --> 18:07.360
You know, for a high end piece of production software, $300.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.360
I guess.

18:08.360 --> 18:09.360
No, that's actually less than I figured.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.360
I guess it's on sale.

18:10.360 --> 18:11.360
So I don't, I don't know.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.360
That's about what I figured.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.080
So the demo worked out and everything.

18:14.080 --> 18:18.520
I mean, honestly, $300 for really high end audio production, a software that has a good

18:18.520 --> 18:20.320
solid UI on Linux.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.320
Exactly.

18:21.320 --> 18:22.320
And cross platform too.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.320
Yeah.

18:23.320 --> 18:24.320
I mean, I'm all for it.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.320
Yeah, of course.

18:25.320 --> 18:26.320
I will keep watching.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.640
I would keep watching the open source software too, but this seems like a really nice piece

18:29.640 --> 18:30.640
of software.

18:30.640 --> 18:34.240
But this illustrates a real defining point of, I love using open source apps, but honestly

18:34.240 --> 18:36.080
I'm going to use the tool on Linux that works.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.080
I'm sorry.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.080
I just am.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.080
You know?

18:39.080 --> 18:40.080
Yeah.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.080
That's just me.

18:41.080 --> 18:44.400
So here's what we have going in the Linux action show subreddit and we could use your

18:44.400 --> 18:45.680
input.

18:45.680 --> 18:48.840
Number one, first up, producer Q5Sys created a thread.

18:48.840 --> 18:53.440
Your help needed coming up with a list of the best GNOME tweaks and extensions.

18:53.440 --> 18:56.240
And this will have linked in the feedback section of the Linux unplugged show notes.

18:56.240 --> 18:59.800
It's also currently sticky to the top of the subreddit.

18:59.800 --> 19:00.800
Now here's the thing.

19:00.800 --> 19:04.480
We've gotten a lot of extensions, which is cool.

19:04.480 --> 19:07.520
Like I'm totally trolling it and like adding a few more extensions to my GNOME, which you

19:07.520 --> 19:09.960
know is a great idea.

19:09.960 --> 19:13.320
But we haven't gotten a lot of straight up tweaks and hacks.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.320
Now don't freak out.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.840
We're not going to try to say, hey, this is great ways to break your GNOME.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.760
But if we were going to have a little fun, like if we're just hanging out and having

19:19.760 --> 19:24.840
some fun, what are kind of things that you do to GNOME to make it more better beyond

19:24.840 --> 19:25.840
just an extension?

19:25.840 --> 19:27.960
Now extensions are welcome too, especially if they're not well known.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.200
We'll have it linked in the show notes.

19:30.200 --> 19:36.280
There is some future content coming down the road that may use your answer.

19:36.280 --> 19:37.720
I'll just put that out there.

19:37.720 --> 19:38.720
Q5, anything you want to...

19:38.720 --> 19:39.720
Did he leave?

19:39.720 --> 19:40.720
No.

19:40.720 --> 19:41.720
Not really.

19:41.720 --> 19:42.720
He's kind of still here.

19:42.720 --> 19:43.720
Yeah.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.720
Well, he can chime in later if there's anything he wanted to add to that.

19:45.720 --> 19:48.040
No, I just dropped into another channel because of mic issues.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.040
Oh, okay.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.040
Yeah.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.640
Is there anything you wanted to add to my coverage of your thread there?

19:51.640 --> 19:52.780
Is that good?

19:52.780 --> 19:53.880
Just basically, yeah.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.560
We're looking for more than just extensions.

19:55.560 --> 19:56.560
Yeah.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.560
Okay.

19:57.560 --> 20:00.080
If that's other applications or other things that work well with GNOME that make you enhance

20:00.080 --> 20:01.920
the desktop experience, we want to know about it.

20:01.920 --> 20:02.920
I've got a hack.

20:02.920 --> 20:03.920
It's called Cinnamon.

20:03.920 --> 20:08.320
I was going to say, made in material.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.320
Okay.

20:09.320 --> 20:14.160
The next thread I want to give a little attention to, which AUR helper do you guys use?

20:14.160 --> 20:19.000
I wanted to give a link out to this because we might do a roundup of this very soon.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.440
And I wanted to kind of get everybody's input.

20:20.440 --> 20:22.600
Right now, pack AUR is leading the pack.

20:22.600 --> 20:26.640
I'm surprised how many people are saying your word, you masochist.

20:26.640 --> 20:30.240
So go over to there and put your comments in there.

20:30.240 --> 20:33.360
Any other kind of like Pac-Man tricks and techniques you have?

20:33.360 --> 20:34.360
Yes.

20:34.360 --> 20:35.360
I know it's arch-specific.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.360
Don't worry.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.360
Don't get...

20:37.360 --> 20:38.360
We're going to do it for other distros too, but we're just experimenting with it because

20:38.360 --> 20:40.720
XOO started up and I thought, Hey, you know what?

20:40.720 --> 20:41.720
Let's do this.

20:41.720 --> 20:45.000
So we're going to do a roundup of some of the tips and advice people give in there.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.280
And then we'll do it again for future distributions as well.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.600
So don't worry.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.160
I'm sure next up on the list will be one of them Debian based distributions.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.160
I hear those are popular.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.160
I hear people like to use those.

20:55.160 --> 20:57.040
No, it's a myth.

20:57.040 --> 21:00.040
Aren't you on 14.04 Ubuntu Mate edition right now?

21:00.040 --> 21:01.520
I am and I'm proud of it.

21:01.520 --> 21:02.520
Yeah.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.520
I'm actually quite happy with it.

21:03.520 --> 21:04.520
Yeah.

21:04.520 --> 21:05.520
It's definitely different.

21:05.520 --> 21:09.840
Do you count to how many PPAs you have set up right now?

21:09.840 --> 21:10.840
On this machine.

21:10.840 --> 21:11.840
This is my...

21:11.840 --> 21:12.840
I think maybe two.

21:12.840 --> 21:14.560
I just don't use that much stuff.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.560
That's not bad.

21:15.560 --> 21:16.560
That's not bad.

21:16.560 --> 21:17.560
Yeah.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.560
You know?

21:18.560 --> 21:19.560
Yeah.

21:19.560 --> 21:20.560
Maybe three.

21:20.560 --> 21:21.560
Maybe three.

21:21.560 --> 21:22.560
I'll be generous.

21:22.560 --> 21:23.560
So I guess...

21:23.560 --> 21:27.760
Seriously, here was my most recent run with an Ubuntu based machine is I did 1504 alpha

21:27.760 --> 21:32.720
two or whatever it is to get the latest KDE Plasma and I had about three or four PPAs

21:32.720 --> 21:36.600
and within about two weeks of using it I was getting a 404 on one of my PPAs.

21:36.600 --> 21:37.600
Uh-oh.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.600
I don't know.

21:38.600 --> 21:39.680
That just drives me crazy.

21:39.680 --> 21:40.680
It's a small complaint.

21:40.680 --> 21:41.680
It's not a big deal.

21:41.680 --> 21:42.680
But it's a great OS.

21:42.680 --> 21:43.680
Yeah.

21:43.680 --> 21:46.360
And it's something I would like to see evolve because I'd love to see the PPA system evolve

21:46.360 --> 21:47.360
into something better.

21:47.360 --> 21:48.360
I'm definitely open to that.

21:48.360 --> 21:49.360
That'd be awesome.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.080
What I find to be pretty interesting is I don't know if you saw that Dell's going to

21:52.080 --> 21:55.000
be shipping a couple of Linux laptops.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.360
And one we knew about and another one that's a larger laptop and on both laptops they're

21:59.360 --> 22:03.120
going to use Ubuntu 14.04.

22:03.120 --> 22:04.120
Not surprised.

22:04.120 --> 22:07.100
I mean, because a lot of times people when they're buying a system, if they're buying

22:07.100 --> 22:11.200
it pre-installed, they probably don't give a rip about bleeding edge.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.920
They probably just want it to work theoretically.

22:12.920 --> 22:13.920
Yeah.

22:13.920 --> 22:14.920
Yeah.

22:14.920 --> 22:15.920
And so that makes sense from and from a support perspective.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.920
But here's what's interesting about the decision.

22:17.920 --> 22:22.080
The kernel in 14.04 doesn't have Thunderbolt support.

22:22.080 --> 22:27.680
So the laptop will be shipping with an unusable Thunderbolt port that may get updated later

22:27.680 --> 22:29.480
in 14.04.

22:29.480 --> 22:34.960
Again, thinking of the fact that it's who's buying the laptop and what their general audience

22:34.960 --> 22:35.960
is.

22:35.960 --> 22:36.960
I just think it's interesting.

22:36.960 --> 22:40.120
I think it's still, yeah, I think it's something that hopefully they disclose clearly because

22:40.120 --> 22:43.440
that could definitely be a real problem if they're boasting the port and then it doesn't

22:43.440 --> 22:44.440
work.

22:44.440 --> 22:45.440
That's a big no.

22:45.440 --> 22:46.440
I think it means 14.04 is a clear winner.

22:46.440 --> 22:50.160
I think, I mean, I guess they couldn't really ship with 14.10 really, but yeah, I just...

22:50.160 --> 22:51.760
Well, and how does Dell do that?

22:51.760 --> 22:54.560
So it's like, okay, so they're presenting this new laptop.

22:54.560 --> 22:57.020
They've got this port they're probably talking about.

22:57.020 --> 22:58.680
Do they disclose that in their materials?

22:58.680 --> 22:59.680
They must, right?

22:59.680 --> 23:00.680
They must.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.680
I would hope so.

23:01.680 --> 23:02.680
Just hope so.

23:02.680 --> 23:05.720
Wizard Jed, you wanted to toss in, if you found yourself in this position, there is

23:05.720 --> 23:06.720
an option, right?

23:06.720 --> 23:07.720
Yeah.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.920
I actually had this problem itself.

23:08.920 --> 23:16.280
I needed 3.16 and I could not go and use the kernel that was in 14.04 itself.

23:16.280 --> 23:23.520
And anyway, so to go and get it, there's actually backported kernels themselves inside of every

23:23.520 --> 23:26.400
single LTS for every version above it.

23:26.400 --> 23:30.240
I didn't know about that, but that's something you got to go and read the Ubuntu Wiki about.

23:30.240 --> 23:31.920
Ah, well, here's good news.

23:31.920 --> 23:33.360
And I was wondering if this is true.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.800
I knew they were going to do hardware enablements for 14.04.

23:35.800 --> 23:40.140
Well, JBLive, who just joined the chat room, said that there's going to be a hardware enablement

23:40.140 --> 23:44.880
stack in 14.04.2, which will be released in a couple of days.

23:44.880 --> 23:45.880
So that works, right?

23:45.880 --> 23:48.760
So pretty much by the time anybody gets their hands on these, the update will be out.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.280
So once you get your machine and you install an update, you'll be okay.

23:51.280 --> 23:52.280
It's not so bad.

23:52.280 --> 23:53.280
There you go.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.280
Yeah, you reboot and you have Thunderbolt.

23:54.280 --> 23:55.280
Hey, isn't that kind of magic?

23:55.280 --> 23:57.880
See, 14.04, I tell you, it's a pretty solid release.

23:57.880 --> 24:00.640
All right, Matt, well, hey, guess what?

24:00.640 --> 24:05.000
We're going to do a recap of FOSDEM, a conference that I think this is almost, I'm almost going

24:05.000 --> 24:09.200
to run out of excuses why I can't go, especially since I'm going to be going to Canada soon.

24:09.200 --> 24:12.840
But first, I want to tell you about the great folks over at DigitalOcean who are now rocking

24:12.840 --> 24:15.560
FreeBSD, CoreOS, and a bunch of other great distributions.

24:15.560 --> 24:20.800
Head over to DigitalOcean.com right now to spin yourself up your own server up in the

24:20.800 --> 24:24.280
cloud that you get root access to in less than a minute.

24:24.280 --> 24:27.780
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

24:27.780 --> 24:30.700
simple way to spin up your own server.

24:30.700 --> 24:34.840
It feels like I am the master orchestrator of my own data center.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.720
And here's what you get in less than a minute for $5 a month.

24:37.720 --> 24:38.720
Let's go over there.

24:38.720 --> 24:39.840
It means crazy, right?

24:39.840 --> 24:40.840
Think about that.

24:40.840 --> 24:45.560
Less than a minute and for $5 a month, 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU,

24:45.560 --> 24:48.040
and a terabyte of transfer.

24:48.040 --> 24:52.700
DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

24:52.700 --> 24:57.640
and London, like I always mention, if you're like me, I'm not even kidding.

24:57.640 --> 25:02.480
I like data center porn so much that I really do, and that's why I always mention the DigitalOcean

25:02.480 --> 25:06.440
as the pictures of their data centers up on their Instagram and their G Plus feeds.

25:06.440 --> 25:09.400
So here's how I am.

25:09.400 --> 25:13.640
I went over to, there's a brand new hotel that just opened up here in Smokey Point,

25:13.640 --> 25:16.340
and I kind of wanted to check it out because I think we're going to be sending the host

25:16.340 --> 25:17.600
there when they arrive.

25:17.600 --> 25:18.600
I'm not sure.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.840
We might move hotels, right?

25:19.840 --> 25:23.280
Because this is brand new and it's fun for when people come in out of town to stay in

25:23.280 --> 25:24.280
a new hotel.

25:24.280 --> 25:25.280
That's a nice thing, right?

25:25.280 --> 25:26.280
And so I've got to go check it out.

25:26.280 --> 25:27.280
I've got to check out the Wi-Fi, right?

25:27.280 --> 25:30.120
I've got to go make sure the crew is going to be taken care of when they come in for

25:30.120 --> 25:31.120
Linux Fest Northwest.

25:31.120 --> 25:34.720
These are the things you do as a podcaster apparently.

25:34.720 --> 25:39.920
So I go over to this Best Western, and I'm walking around and I'm kind of getting the

25:39.920 --> 25:40.920
lay of the land.

25:40.920 --> 25:44.040
I'm looking at what the conference centers were, and the guy, the manager who's running

25:44.040 --> 25:47.520
the place, he happens to walk out, and I started asking him questions about the infrastructure.

25:47.520 --> 25:50.040
I say, hey, can I see your server closet, and he actually lets me in.

25:50.040 --> 25:56.320
I mentioned I used to work in IT, so I'd warmed him up a little bit, but I'm so interested

25:56.320 --> 25:58.440
in how people have their setups.

25:58.440 --> 26:01.200
It's just the coolest thing to see how different people do their configs.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.600
So I got him to show me the server room, and I'm like, okay, this is pretty great.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.600
It's not exactly what I expected.

26:04.600 --> 26:07.680
I'm like, you're not managing all your telco and Wi-Fi equipment here, right?

26:07.680 --> 26:08.680
That must be in a different room.

26:08.680 --> 26:10.160
He's like, yeah, it's upstairs.

26:10.160 --> 26:13.760
And so we go up, we ride the elevator up a couple of floors, and I go look at their telco

26:13.760 --> 26:17.120
closet, and I was like, this is awesome.

26:17.120 --> 26:20.240
That's why I'm always over the DigitalOcean page checking out some of their pictures,

26:20.240 --> 26:23.480
because not only do I appreciate the fact that all their technology is running on Linux,

26:23.480 --> 26:28.200
which I love, sitting on top of KVM, which is the boss, all on top of those SSD drives

26:28.200 --> 26:31.080
that DigitalOcean invested, and then they connected to tier one bandwidth in those data

26:31.080 --> 26:35.560
centers all over the world with this interface, right, this super simple, intuitive interface,

26:35.560 --> 26:37.240
which is really simple.

26:37.240 --> 26:42.120
I mean, it's so amazing how you can move a machine between data centers, back it up and

26:42.120 --> 26:46.080
restore that snapshot, create a machine based off another snapshot, do DNS management, set

26:46.080 --> 26:51.440
up SSH keys, HTML5 console, like, but it's like crazy in your face easy, and on top of

26:51.440 --> 26:54.920
all of that, all that power, like if you want to get nitty-gritty, can be replicated with

26:54.920 --> 26:57.040
their straightforward API.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.520
And people will just be building apps like crazy for that, so you can take advantage

26:59.520 --> 27:00.520
of that, too.

27:00.520 --> 27:03.440
So go check out DigitalOcean, but here's the thing, this is what you got to do, you got

27:03.440 --> 27:07.080
to support your favorite unplugged, right, this is your favorite talk show, Linux Unplugged,

27:07.080 --> 27:08.080
you got to support that.

27:08.080 --> 27:12.480
So use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, and I'll give you a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean,

27:12.480 --> 27:14.960
which is really nice, too, and I like this a lot, is you can kind of get started without

27:14.960 --> 27:17.920
even having a credit card, because you can just apply in a balance, so if you got a couple

27:17.920 --> 27:21.400
of bucks in your PayPal account, you just pop that into your DigitalOcean account, but

27:21.400 --> 27:25.520
you can get started for free with our $10 promo code, try out the $5 rig, two months,

27:25.520 --> 27:26.520
$5 rig.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.520
That's awesome, right?

27:27.520 --> 27:32.120
DOUNPLUGGED, go build our own cloud, go play with CoreOS, go try out BitTorrent Sync, why

27:32.120 --> 27:36.880
not do SyncThing, I mean, GitHub, or GitLab, Ghost, I mean, the list, I mean, the crazy

27:36.880 --> 27:40.320
list goes on, and there's a bunch of one-click deployments, too, I could just go on about

27:40.320 --> 27:44.120
how great it is, and how it's, for me, like, whenever I just know I need, okay, I need

27:44.120 --> 27:47.020
a Linux rig to do something, I just spin it up right there.

27:47.020 --> 27:50.040
I'll tell you, and when you're running something for clients, and you're like, okay, well,

27:50.040 --> 27:53.240
I don't necessarily want to run anything on their stuff initially, I want to run it on

27:53.240 --> 27:56.360
mine, transfer it over, makes transfers easy.

27:56.360 --> 28:01.760
DigitalOcean.com, DOUNPLUGGED, all lowercase one word, when your face is over at DigitalOcean,

28:01.760 --> 28:05.160
and a big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring our faces.

28:05.160 --> 28:10.840
So FOSDEM15 wrapped up a free software event for developers to meet, share ideas, and collaborate.

28:10.840 --> 28:14.320
They say every year, thousands of developers of free and open-source software from all

28:14.320 --> 28:17.160
over the world gather an event in Brussels.

28:17.160 --> 28:19.600
I wish I was there.

28:19.600 --> 28:24.120
But Popey was there, and I've been, Popey's been trying to tell me about it all morning,

28:24.120 --> 28:27.400
and I said, Popey, save it for the show, don't tell me anything, Popey.

28:27.400 --> 28:31.800
So Popey, I've got to start, I'll ask Alan's question, did you see the BSD people at FOSDEM?

28:31.800 --> 28:34.360
Nope, not a single one.

28:34.360 --> 28:35.360
Sorry, Alan.

28:35.360 --> 28:39.680
I probably did, I probably did, I probably bumped into them in the corridors, it's absolutely

28:39.680 --> 28:41.400
rammed, the places that you say.

28:41.400 --> 28:42.400
Thousands?

28:42.400 --> 28:43.400
Is it really thousands of people?

28:43.400 --> 28:49.760
So the biggest room they have is a lecture hall, it happens at university in Brussels,

28:49.760 --> 28:56.280
and the biggest room they have holds officially 1,400 people, and it was pretty rammed on

28:56.280 --> 28:59.640
more than one occasion, and all the other rooms get full as well.

28:59.640 --> 29:03.360
So yeah, there's a lot of people there, it's a very, very busy conference.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.360
So it was-

29:04.360 --> 29:07.960
Yeah, like I was just looking at it, and you know, the conferences I'm used to, they're

29:07.960 --> 29:13.160
at most four talks going on at once, and I think there are 24 happening at FOSDEM at

29:13.160 --> 29:14.160
a time.

29:14.160 --> 29:15.160
Wow.

29:15.160 --> 29:18.920
Right, yeah, so they have it split up into a number of tracks, so you've got like a

29:18.920 --> 29:24.360
desktop track, distributions track, internet of things track, Go track, you know, you've

29:24.360 --> 29:30.440
got developer, separate developer rooms for Mozilla, for Java, MySQL, you know, it's all

29:30.440 --> 29:35.360
grouped nicely, so you can, you know, you know where to go, because a room is dedicated

29:35.360 --> 29:41.200
to a particular topic, so if you're MySQL heavy, you would go to that room, and if you're

29:41.200 --> 29:44.720
interested in most of the Mozilla talks, you'd go to that room.

29:44.720 --> 29:50.400
But they have an app that you can put on your Android or iOS phone, and a website where

29:50.400 --> 29:54.480
you can see the entire schedule, and you can bookmark the talks you want to go to, and

29:54.480 --> 29:57.880
then your phone will, you know, ping you when that talk's coming up.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.880
This is really impressive.

29:59.880 --> 30:00.880
This is like the best-

30:00.880 --> 30:01.880
It's unbelievably well-organized.

30:01.880 --> 30:05.200
Yeah, this is like the best system we've ever seen.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.200
Look at this.

30:06.200 --> 30:07.200
Look at this.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.200
This is incredible.

30:08.200 --> 30:15.000
I'd schedule, I'd put in my bookmarks on the way there, what I wanted to go and see, and

30:15.000 --> 30:21.360
the app updates over the air and lets you know, you know, when talks are going to be.

30:21.360 --> 30:26.140
I haven't been for like five, six years, and this is my first time for a while, and it's

30:26.140 --> 30:31.240
just as I remember it, it's, you know, information dense, there are a lot of very detailed talks,

30:31.240 --> 30:35.280
there are some high-level ones, like a little introduction to what, you know, some project

30:35.280 --> 30:39.000
here or there is doing, but there are some detailed ones, and they cover a really wide

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
gambit.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.640
You don't have to be focused on just one topic, there's so much there.

30:42.640 --> 30:47.080
So I went to, I'll give you a few highlights of what I went to.

30:47.080 --> 30:54.920
One was one from fWatch, which is a GPS watch made from free software, free hardware, 3D

30:54.920 --> 30:59.760
printed case, components you can buy off the shelf to make your own GPS watch, make your

30:59.760 --> 31:03.800
own apps, to have a thing on your wrist that you have total freedom over.

31:03.800 --> 31:04.800
That was cool.

31:04.800 --> 31:11.160
I went to a talk from the Tizen, not Tizen, Yola guys actually, both the Tizen talk and

31:11.160 --> 31:20.240
a Yola talk about both had a talk about porting their platform to other devices, which was

31:20.240 --> 31:23.300
good to see.

31:23.300 --> 31:27.200
One about, there was a there's a legal room, which was surprisingly busy, a bunch of lawyers

31:27.200 --> 31:32.880
standing talking about the intricacies of licensing was, you know, pretty rammed.

31:32.880 --> 31:36.440
That room was pretty densely packed all the time.

31:36.440 --> 31:42.040
And that was interesting to listen to their interpretation of upcoming laws in both EU

31:42.040 --> 31:46.640
and the US and whether they will impact the validity of the GPL, which obviously is going

31:46.640 --> 31:50.560
to have an impact on lots of people at a free software conference.

31:50.560 --> 31:53.320
So that was that was pretty interesting.

31:53.320 --> 31:58.200
And there was also one on in the legal room, there was one from Bradley Coon, who gave

31:58.200 --> 32:05.720
a retrospective of a GPL violation that he had to deal with.

32:05.720 --> 32:07.120
And it's a very interesting talk.

32:07.120 --> 32:11.520
And it's called fighting a GPL violation by coding instead.

32:11.520 --> 32:16.680
So instead of suing someone, they fork and, and continue developing under a different

32:16.680 --> 32:17.680
name.

32:17.680 --> 32:22.720
And the good news is that the FOSDEM organizers videotape all of these, I say videotape, and

32:22.720 --> 32:26.880
I sound like I'm from the 80s, but they actually record it onto SD cards or some brand new

32:26.880 --> 32:29.280
technology I haven't ascertained yet.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.280
And they put them online.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.600
So you go to the FOSDEM website, you can see a lot of these.

32:32.600 --> 32:34.400
But there's so many awesome talks.

32:34.400 --> 32:39.320
The one I think one of the most oversubscribed that I couldn't actually get into the room,

32:39.320 --> 32:45.120
the room was full was Lennox talk on system D 2015.

32:45.120 --> 32:49.920
What's new in system D, it's been reported on in the press by people who were there.

32:49.920 --> 32:53.720
People were like live tweeting, Lennox talk.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.880
What does that make you think when you hear that, right?

32:56.880 --> 32:59.640
Like here's a here's somebody who live blogged it.

32:59.640 --> 33:06.040
And he notes that there was no slides, none whatsoever, no presentation, he just talked.

33:06.040 --> 33:09.160
Right, he had notes on his phone in front of him, I think.

33:09.160 --> 33:13.480
But yeah, no, no slides, he can just, you know, he's a bit of a superstar, isn't he?

33:13.480 --> 33:17.640
You know, when we go to somewhere like FOSDEM, where there's, you know, 1000 or more people

33:17.640 --> 33:20.640
who want to get into a room and listen to this guy talk about something that's very

33:20.640 --> 33:24.720
fundamental to the platform that they're developing on or developing for.

33:24.720 --> 33:26.880
Of course, they want to listen to it.

33:26.880 --> 33:31.720
It's it's like our equivalent of queuing up around the corner to an Apple Store to get

33:31.720 --> 33:35.880
a you know, a new iPhone, you queue up to listen to Lennox talk about what's coming

33:35.880 --> 33:37.720
in a piece of software that he's developing.

33:37.720 --> 33:39.040
I think it's much the same thing.

33:39.040 --> 33:42.520
I had a couple of just not to derail you because I'm loving the cover.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.520
Sure.

33:43.520 --> 33:46.140
I had a couple of quick things that he did talk about because I know you didn't make

33:46.140 --> 33:49.520
it in the talk, so I just wanted to call out a couple of things.

33:49.520 --> 33:54.720
Console D, support for higher DPI screens on the console, systemctl cat, systemctl edit.

33:54.720 --> 33:58.260
You can cat the config file of any unit so you don't have to know where the actual config

33:58.260 --> 34:03.000
file is, but you can do systemctl cat Apache 2 and it will just cat Apache 2's config

34:03.000 --> 34:05.480
file wherever it is on the file system.

34:05.480 --> 34:07.000
That's something that's coming.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.240
Ping gateway, automatically resolve the gateway of all interfaces and ping them.

34:11.240 --> 34:14.240
Very useful for network troubleshooting and questions like, am I online?

34:14.240 --> 34:18.600
The ping gateway gets resolved automatically, so you actually just type ping gateway at

34:18.600 --> 34:23.760
the command line and it will ping your gateway for you to see if your network is up.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.640
Here's a big one.

34:25.640 --> 34:30.840
Network D, because networking is such a basic function of the US, Lenart believes it should

34:30.840 --> 34:33.040
be part of system D, so they want to roll that in.

34:33.040 --> 34:39.240
Auditing, improved application auditing, he says it was for the NSA, can log all system

34:39.240 --> 34:43.000
calls made to etc password, etc to the audit log.

34:43.000 --> 34:48.440
Network D adds support for multiple resolvings, DNS cache per interface.

34:48.440 --> 34:53.760
Journal D remote, so a whole new remote system for the journal D. The binary logger now gets

34:53.760 --> 34:56.640
remote support via HTTP.

34:56.640 --> 35:01.040
Journal D has a pull and push model, pull HTTP get and request for JSON streams from

35:01.040 --> 35:02.600
the journal.

35:02.600 --> 35:06.760
Push model pushes via an HTTP post request to the remote journal D instance, allows for

35:06.760 --> 35:10.600
simple implementations of programs like via PHP and Ruby to send data to remote journal

35:10.600 --> 35:13.120
D endpoints, since it's just an HTTP post.

35:13.120 --> 35:16.960
They're talking about the log here, people, that could replace this log.

35:16.960 --> 35:19.680
Time sync D, the idea it's not to run NTPD on every device.

35:19.680 --> 35:23.880
It's very simple, trivial, not a server, as simple as possible, NTP client built into

35:23.880 --> 35:32.960
system D. Automatic GPT partition table discovery, even if you don't have an Etsy FS tab, which

35:32.960 --> 35:37.000
is sometimes absent on stateless systems, a lot of things going into system D for stateless

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
systems.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
I'm giving you the highlights here.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
You can read more on the page.

35:40.000 --> 35:45.000
But it'll do auto discovery of GPT, discover swap devices, and root partitions even without

35:45.000 --> 35:48.480
any flags in the Etsy FS tab.

35:48.480 --> 35:52.360
Also I'll tell you that the thing that's most exciting in that list for me is high DPI port

35:52.360 --> 35:53.360
in the console.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.360
Yeah.

35:54.360 --> 36:01.160
You know, being able to run Linux, Lynx web browser and high DPI mode on a TTY, it's just,

36:01.160 --> 36:03.480
you know, I've been wanting that for years.

36:03.480 --> 36:04.480
Finally, right?

36:04.480 --> 36:07.280
The last one that's getting some controversy in our mumble room.

36:07.280 --> 36:10.200
They are discontinuing read ahead.

36:10.200 --> 36:13.960
They say in the age of SSDs during boot, they don't really have it.

36:13.960 --> 36:17.440
None of the system D developers even have spinning hard drives.

36:17.440 --> 36:22.080
All system D developers have SSDs, so nobody really wanted to support it anymore anyways.

36:22.080 --> 36:25.500
And they say the read ahead bits needed during the boot process aren't really needed with

36:25.500 --> 36:28.020
SSD drives anymore.

36:28.020 --> 36:29.020
So I'd agree with that.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.320
What about those of us who have spinning hard drives still?

36:32.320 --> 36:33.320
It's still so minimal.

36:33.320 --> 36:36.380
Well, technically they kind of pointed out that, yeah, it didn't make enough of a difference

36:36.380 --> 36:42.920
to bother maintaining it even, you know, despite the fact that it was, there are people that

36:42.920 --> 36:44.760
are still going to not have SSDs.

36:44.760 --> 36:45.760
Yeah.

36:45.760 --> 36:50.560
The main problem was is that it was read ahead only really gives you a bonus when the, whatever

36:50.560 --> 36:54.320
application that is benefiting from read ahead is programmed poorly.

36:54.320 --> 36:59.200
So as people went and actually fixed the applications, it became less and less important.

36:59.200 --> 37:00.200
Yeah.

37:00.200 --> 37:02.280
So Popi, how was the, what was the culture like?

37:02.280 --> 37:03.360
Did you guys eat a lot?

37:03.360 --> 37:05.800
Was there a lot of beer or a lot of eating?

37:05.800 --> 37:10.360
It happens in Brussels and Brussels has a reputation for having lots of beer.

37:10.360 --> 37:15.000
And in fact, the conference starts on the Friday evening, really everyone meets up at

37:15.000 --> 37:20.600
a bar called Delirium and you need to get there early if you want to get a table, otherwise

37:20.600 --> 37:25.840
it's standing room only and they have loads of different beers, many, many different types

37:25.840 --> 37:28.800
of beer and it's all delicious.

37:28.800 --> 37:34.120
And it's great because there's a great atmosphere in there and you get to see all the famous,

37:34.120 --> 37:39.280
you know, free software luminaries who all go there for a beer.

37:39.280 --> 37:43.200
And in fact, it's so busy that I had to queue to get out of the bar.

37:43.200 --> 37:44.200
It was that busy.

37:44.200 --> 37:45.200
Oh boy.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.200
Oh boy.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.680
It's, it's, it's completely rammed inside and rammed outside.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.400
And there's bars at Fozdem as well.

37:49.400 --> 37:52.760
So once you get to the actual venue at the university.

37:52.760 --> 37:54.600
There's bars at the university?

37:54.600 --> 37:55.600
Oh yeah.

37:55.600 --> 37:56.600
Loads.

37:56.600 --> 37:57.600
Oh hello, hello.

37:57.600 --> 37:58.600
Yeah.

37:58.600 --> 38:04.160
So there's street vendors selling Belgian waffles and you know, other kinds of food

38:04.160 --> 38:07.760
and then yeah, there's, there's bars all around the place so you can have a couple of beers

38:07.760 --> 38:12.200
while you're, while you're watching a talk or at the end of the day, you know, relax

38:12.200 --> 38:18.960
and digest, you know, I just wanted to mention a couple of, yeah, it's a very different culture.

38:18.960 --> 38:23.760
It's one of the reasons it's part of the culture of Fozdem is, you know, it's, it's very information

38:23.760 --> 38:24.760
dense in places.

38:24.760 --> 38:25.760
That's great.

38:25.760 --> 38:26.760
Equally.

38:26.760 --> 38:27.760
Yeah.

38:27.760 --> 38:28.760
So it's a very, very social.

38:28.760 --> 38:29.760
Yeah, I love that.

38:29.760 --> 38:30.760
Social meetup.

38:30.760 --> 38:35.040
So I just wanted to mention a couple of other things that are worth looking up if you can,

38:35.040 --> 38:36.120
if you find the videos.

38:36.120 --> 38:41.880
One of them was a talk that I, I was surprised I, I didn't think would be spun out for 25

38:41.880 --> 38:42.880
minutes.

38:42.880 --> 38:45.440
I thought, wow, it's gonna be five minutes and we're going to be out of here.

38:45.440 --> 38:50.100
And it's by a guy called Daniel Stenberg and he's the author of Curl.

38:50.100 --> 38:56.800
You may be aware of Curl, the command line tool that allows you to communicate with servers.

38:56.800 --> 39:00.280
And it was really interesting because I didn't realize how widely Curl was used.

39:00.280 --> 39:01.280
Oh, sure.

39:01.280 --> 39:02.880
And what it could do.

39:02.880 --> 39:03.880
Yeah.

39:03.880 --> 39:06.420
And you know, there's millions and millions of installations.

39:06.420 --> 39:07.840
Every company uses it.

39:07.840 --> 39:12.480
Probably every person in the room in his, in the guy's talk had a device that had Curl

39:12.480 --> 39:13.480
or libcurl on it.

39:13.480 --> 39:17.440
That was, it was quite interesting to learn, you know, the ubiquity of something like Curl.

39:17.440 --> 39:18.440
Right.

39:18.440 --> 39:22.480
And the final one that I wanted to mention was a guy called Ryan McDonald who gave a

39:22.480 --> 39:25.680
talk called Living on Mars, a beginner's guide.

39:25.680 --> 39:30.520
And it was the closing keynote and the room was rammed with over a thousand people, I

39:30.520 --> 39:31.520
would say.

39:31.520 --> 39:37.440
And it was all about how he's applied for a position on the Mars One mission to go on

39:37.440 --> 39:39.200
one way trip to Mars.

39:39.200 --> 39:44.960
And he talked all about the plan and the preparation and some of the pitfalls, but also how they're

39:44.960 --> 39:48.240
using open source in the whole project.

39:48.240 --> 39:49.240
Cool.

39:49.240 --> 39:50.580
It was brilliant.

39:50.580 --> 39:53.360
It was, if any video you should look up, look up that one.

39:53.360 --> 39:58.360
It's very, it's very positive, very forward looking, actually made me think that mankind

39:58.360 --> 40:00.160
isn't completely living on Mars.

40:00.160 --> 40:03.080
I will have it linked in the show notes.

40:03.080 --> 40:04.080
I just found it.

40:04.080 --> 40:05.160
Good one, Poby.

40:05.160 --> 40:07.200
So that was that, was that your favorite keynote?

40:07.200 --> 40:09.160
Yeah, that was one of them.

40:09.160 --> 40:13.000
I mean, they were all brilliant and I've got so much to think about and I took loads of

40:13.000 --> 40:15.440
notes and I learned lots as well.

40:15.440 --> 40:20.240
So and I, I took on board lots of information from other communities as well.

40:20.240 --> 40:22.720
So it wasn't just sat in the Ubuntu room all the time.

40:22.720 --> 40:28.160
I learned a lot from Tizen, from Yola, from Mozilla and from lots of other projects as

40:28.160 --> 40:29.160
well.

40:29.160 --> 40:32.080
So it was, it was totally worthwhile and I'd highly recommend anyone goes.

40:32.080 --> 40:36.160
If that was on the West Coast, would you travel the distance to go to it on the West Coast

40:36.160 --> 40:37.920
here in the United States?

40:37.920 --> 40:38.920
If someone else paid?

40:38.920 --> 40:39.920
Yes.

40:39.920 --> 40:40.920
Okay.

40:40.920 --> 40:41.920
Somebody else paid.

40:41.920 --> 40:43.480
That's always the trick, isn't it?

40:43.480 --> 40:44.480
Yep.

40:44.480 --> 40:45.480
Well, that's, I really want to go.

40:45.480 --> 40:47.160
And so they do a course every year.

40:47.160 --> 40:48.160
Yeah.

40:48.160 --> 40:53.680
But it's in the beginning of February, it gets announced kind of mid, midway through

40:53.680 --> 40:56.440
the year, like August time or something like that.

40:56.440 --> 41:00.960
And everyone starts booking their hotels or their train or their, their plane journey

41:00.960 --> 41:03.080
pretty early on.

41:03.080 --> 41:07.920
All the public transport in, it's funny, you're going to stand at a bus stop in, in Brussels

41:07.920 --> 41:10.520
and it's just nerds everywhere.

41:10.520 --> 41:13.320
And it's quite amusing when they get on the bus, they're all trying to figure out how

41:13.320 --> 41:17.200
to use the ticket machine and you can spot the newbies who are getting on the bus at

41:17.200 --> 41:18.200
the wrong end.

41:18.200 --> 41:19.200
That kind of stuff.

41:19.200 --> 41:20.200
That would be me.

41:20.200 --> 41:21.200
That would be me.

41:21.200 --> 41:22.200
Hilarious.

41:22.200 --> 41:23.200
Yeah.

41:23.200 --> 41:24.200
Yeah.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.200
It was me as well.

41:25.200 --> 41:26.200
Well, good.

41:26.200 --> 41:27.440
I, geez, I, uh, I hope that more of the videos come out.

41:27.440 --> 41:32.360
I, I, when I looked around on YouTube this morning, I saw a, uh, a lot of, uh, from 2014.

41:32.360 --> 41:34.720
I haven't seen a lot from 2015, but I did see a couple.

41:34.720 --> 41:35.720
Right.

41:35.720 --> 41:39.600
Well, I mean, as Alan said, there's so many tracks, so much video content they've got

41:39.600 --> 41:40.600
to get online.

41:40.600 --> 41:44.640
I would think they're, you know, just about now, a couple of days later, having a hangover

41:44.640 --> 41:47.600
recovery and, uh, they'll start getting them online soon.

41:47.600 --> 41:51.640
Uh, so before we, uh, totally move off, uh, just one quick SystemD thing, uh, there's

41:51.640 --> 41:56.260
also a blog up, uh, on how, uh, Plasma Desktop will use SystemD and in short, they're going

41:56.260 --> 42:02.120
to rely on Lognd for a lot of things, uh, and including, uh, device management, uh,

42:02.120 --> 42:06.280
and the inhibitor locks that Lognd offers where, uh, devices can get root, uh, something

42:06.280 --> 42:09.280
like the login manager can get root access to the keyboard and mouse without making it

42:09.280 --> 42:10.280
available to other applications.

42:10.280 --> 42:16.160
Uh, they'll probably take advantage of time, date, D, uh, and other things, so user units,

42:16.160 --> 42:20.400
so quite a bit of things coming, uh, in down the road for KDE relying on SystemD, too,

42:20.400 --> 42:21.400
so 2015.

42:21.400 --> 42:24.000
Yeah, and they, the KDE stand was, um, was quite busy.

42:24.000 --> 42:29.720
There's a bunch of stands, obviously, exhibition area, and, uh, they had a few, uh, PCs out

42:29.720 --> 42:34.080
with, um, the latest version of Kubuntu with Plasma on it, and I had a little play with

42:34.080 --> 42:35.080
that.

42:35.080 --> 42:36.080
Nice.

42:36.080 --> 42:37.240
Um, it was nice to say hello to them and all the other projects that were there.

42:37.240 --> 42:38.240
It was really good.

42:38.240 --> 42:39.240
Did they recognize you?

42:39.240 --> 42:44.240
Uh, a couple of them did, but, you know, I keep a low profile, try and wear a funny hat

42:44.240 --> 42:45.240
or something.

42:45.240 --> 42:46.240
Did people recognize your voice?

42:46.240 --> 42:49.240
Like, once you open up your mouth, they're like, oh, are you Popey?

42:49.240 --> 42:52.240
No, I'm not, I'm not as well known as you think I am.

42:52.240 --> 42:53.240
Oh, I don't know.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.240
I don't know.

42:54.240 --> 42:55.240
I bet.

42:55.240 --> 42:56.240
I bet.

42:56.240 --> 42:59.760
I was waiting for Alan to flip a table on that SystemD with KDE stuff.

42:59.760 --> 43:02.960
Well, they're working on, they're working on their, uh, shim.

43:02.960 --> 43:03.960
You know, they got a shim.

43:03.960 --> 43:04.960
Yeah, that's true.

43:04.960 --> 43:05.960
That's true.

43:05.960 --> 43:06.960
Uh, all right.

43:06.960 --> 43:08.280
Well, Popey, that was, uh, that was a great update.

43:08.280 --> 43:09.280
Thank you very much.

43:09.280 --> 43:11.320
I'm a totes jelly.

43:11.320 --> 43:12.320
Totes jelly.

43:12.320 --> 43:13.320
Uh, all right.

43:13.320 --> 43:16.120
Well, uh, so I know something that's on the, been on the back of my mind all week.

43:16.120 --> 43:17.120
I don't know.

43:17.120 --> 43:18.120
It's got me especially kind of excited.

43:18.120 --> 43:21.680
I'm also curious to see what producer Q5 says, thanks, uh, cause he's a big Raspberry

43:21.680 --> 43:22.680
Pi fan.

43:22.680 --> 43:26.840
The new Raspberry Pi 2 is out and we're going to talk about it here in a second, but first

43:26.840 --> 43:28.840
I got to mention my buddy's over at Ting.

43:28.840 --> 43:32.200
You know, I got a Ting device now for like two freaking years and it's unbelievable how

43:32.200 --> 43:33.200
much money I've saved.

43:33.200 --> 43:34.200
It's like $2,000.

43:34.200 --> 43:37.280
Uh, I should take that savings and buy Bitcoin right now while it's on.

43:37.280 --> 43:39.080
Isn't Bitcoin on sale right now still?

43:39.080 --> 43:40.080
I think there's still a Bitcoin sale going on.

43:40.080 --> 43:41.080
I think it is.

43:41.080 --> 43:42.080
Yeah.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.080
So I could take some of my Ting savings.

43:43.080 --> 43:44.080
Yeah.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.080
Buy up some of them Bitcoins.

43:45.080 --> 43:48.880
Uh, Ting is mobile that makes sense and the reason why I say that is because they're finally

43:48.880 --> 43:50.280
doing it right.

43:50.280 --> 43:52.280
There's no contract and you just pay for what you use.

43:52.280 --> 43:55.080
It's, so you pay for a $6 just to have the line.

43:55.080 --> 43:56.080
That's it.

43:56.080 --> 43:57.080
Just $6.

43:57.080 --> 43:58.080
$6.

43:58.080 --> 43:59.080
Okay.

43:59.080 --> 44:00.080
And then it's just your usage on top of that.

44:00.080 --> 44:01.080
You turn on hotspot, you just pay for the data.

44:01.080 --> 44:02.080
It's not a big deal.

44:02.080 --> 44:04.920
Uh, and they have a great dashboard so you can manage all of it.

44:04.920 --> 44:07.960
I like that a lot too because that's always been sufficient for me, but they even have

44:07.960 --> 44:10.800
no whole customer service if the dashboard won't do it.

44:10.800 --> 44:11.800
Here's what I want you to do.

44:11.800 --> 44:13.520
Go to linux.ting.com.

44:13.520 --> 44:16.280
Not only do you get to put Linux in your URL bar, which is always good for your internet

44:16.280 --> 44:19.400
history and you know it, you know you need to sanitize that by putting some tech stuff

44:19.400 --> 44:20.400
in there.

44:20.400 --> 44:21.400
linux.ting.com.

44:21.400 --> 44:22.400
Okay.

44:22.400 --> 44:24.720
That'll give you $25 off your first Ting device.

44:24.720 --> 44:28.540
Oh, you got a Ting compatible device because you checked their BYOD page.

44:28.540 --> 44:29.540
Good news, my friend.

44:29.540 --> 44:32.320
They'll give you a $25 credit that will probably pay for your first month.

44:32.320 --> 44:33.320
It did for mine.

44:33.320 --> 44:35.240
Uh, I've got three devices right now.

44:35.240 --> 44:38.200
I think my bills are on $35, $37 usually.

44:38.200 --> 44:39.200
It's great.

44:39.200 --> 44:40.200
It's great.

44:40.200 --> 44:42.720
Go to linux.ting.com and go check out their blog too.

44:42.720 --> 44:44.480
They've always got some great stuff over there.

44:44.480 --> 44:48.440
I'm, you know, as somebody who's a Ting fan for a long time now, I'm always like, is Ting

44:48.440 --> 44:49.440
feeling the heat?

44:49.440 --> 44:50.440
Well, guess what?

44:50.440 --> 44:52.360
People have been wondering that and Ting answered.

44:52.360 --> 44:54.160
So I thought we'd play a little bit of that.

44:54.160 --> 44:59.720
Kyle asks, is it easy being Ting and do you feel heat from the other carriers for being

44:59.720 --> 45:00.720
different?

45:00.720 --> 45:03.960
Well, I think there's two things there.

45:03.960 --> 45:07.000
One, it is incredibly easy being Ting.

45:07.000 --> 45:13.480
You know, I think what would, what we can't imagine is how hard it would be to be one

45:13.480 --> 45:16.840
of the big traditional telecoms.

45:16.840 --> 45:20.680
For us, all we're trying to do is save people money and make them happy.

45:20.680 --> 45:24.280
That is really, really easy to do.

45:24.280 --> 45:28.040
Sort of trying to trick them, fool them, not provide great value.

45:28.040 --> 45:29.040
That would be hard.

45:29.040 --> 45:34.440
And the good news is we're still well small enough that they don't notice us at all.

45:34.440 --> 45:40.560
I think that we certainly do get noticed for some of our innovation, but we're not threatening

45:40.560 --> 45:41.560
anybody yet.

45:41.560 --> 45:49.040
We have to get many times bigger before that's true.

45:49.040 --> 45:54.680
Go to linux.ting.com, it's linux.ting.com.

45:54.680 --> 45:55.920
That's actually the lyrics to that song, Matt.

45:55.920 --> 45:56.920
Did you know that?

45:56.920 --> 45:57.920
I thought it was.

45:57.920 --> 46:00.840
I mean, the jingle just gets stuck in your head and I'm humming it all day long.

46:00.840 --> 46:01.840
Linux.ting.com.

46:01.840 --> 46:02.840
Exactly.

46:02.840 --> 46:06.280
Thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

46:06.280 --> 46:07.280
Guys, go check them out.

46:07.280 --> 46:10.160
I'm really happy for a long time and they're adding GSM support soon, which is going to

46:10.160 --> 46:13.560
be making them like the mega carrier.

46:13.560 --> 46:14.560
That is so exciting.

46:14.560 --> 46:16.800
It's going to be interesting to see who basically says, oh, hey, wait a minute.

46:16.800 --> 46:17.800
I got one of those phones.

46:17.800 --> 46:18.800
Yeah.

46:18.800 --> 46:19.800
I ran it through the compatibility thing.

46:19.800 --> 46:20.800
That's right.

46:20.800 --> 46:21.800
Hey, this could work.

46:21.800 --> 46:22.800
Hey, yeah.

46:22.800 --> 46:26.880
In fact, they're also giving out some, which, oh God, this is the phone I want so bad.

46:26.880 --> 46:28.240
The Moto X2.

46:28.240 --> 46:30.080
It's the new Motorola X with the five inch screen.

46:30.080 --> 46:33.280
They're giving out some of those for people who sign up for the Ting GSM beta.

46:33.280 --> 46:34.600
You can find out more on their blog.

46:34.600 --> 46:35.600
Ooh.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.600
Ooh.

46:36.600 --> 46:37.600
They're feeling so bad.

46:37.600 --> 46:38.600
No kidding, right?

46:38.600 --> 46:40.600
Hey, Matt, did you see that there's a new Raspberry Pi?

46:40.600 --> 46:42.560
Oh man, I see it.

46:42.560 --> 46:43.560
I've been living it.

46:43.560 --> 46:46.680
I've been like trying to come up with use case scenarios on why I should just buy it.

46:46.680 --> 46:47.680
Well, here's what we know.

46:47.680 --> 46:48.680
Okay.

46:48.680 --> 46:49.680
So it's still going to be the same $35.

46:49.680 --> 46:52.980
It's still the same about shape and size as the Raspberry Pi.

46:52.980 --> 46:58.260
It's got a quad core 900 megahertz ARM A7 CPU.

46:58.260 --> 47:00.160
They say about six times the performance.

47:00.160 --> 47:02.320
I've heard speculation otherwise.

47:02.320 --> 47:03.520
One gigabyte of memory.

47:03.520 --> 47:06.180
It's a 2X improvement over the previous model.

47:06.180 --> 47:11.600
And it is totes compatible with the Raspberry Pi 1 as far as the GPIO pin layout goes.

47:11.600 --> 47:14.240
And because you got yourself an ARM 7 process in there, you're going to get yourself a lot

47:14.240 --> 47:19.080
more serious things like Ubuntu snappy core, more different versions of Android.

47:19.080 --> 47:21.800
And ladies and gentlemen, wait for it.

47:21.800 --> 47:22.840
You guessed it.

47:22.840 --> 47:23.840
That's right.

47:23.840 --> 47:24.840
Windows 10.

47:24.840 --> 47:26.840
And proprietary software is not ethical.

47:26.840 --> 47:27.840
Yeah.

47:27.840 --> 47:28.840
It's going to be able to run Windows 10.

47:28.840 --> 47:29.840
Ooh.

47:29.840 --> 47:30.840
That's going to sting a little bit.

47:30.840 --> 47:31.840
Yeah.

47:31.840 --> 47:32.840
A little bit.

47:32.840 --> 47:33.840
But you know.

47:33.840 --> 47:34.840
And then I think people will be like, oh, this is horrible.

47:34.840 --> 47:35.840
Look at this UI.

47:35.840 --> 47:36.960
I get my, I get my Raspberry.

47:36.960 --> 47:37.960
It's too much.

47:37.960 --> 47:40.220
They got too much going on and they released the B plus not that long ago and now they

47:40.220 --> 47:41.220
have this one.

47:41.220 --> 47:42.220
I don't, I mean, whatever.

47:42.220 --> 47:43.220
But.

47:43.220 --> 47:45.400
Well, it'll be Windows 10 chump edition, obviously.

47:45.400 --> 47:47.200
I mean, that's probably what it's going to be on there.

47:47.200 --> 47:48.200
So.

47:48.200 --> 47:49.200
Bentley, I'll open the floor to you, sir.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.200
Yeah.

47:50.200 --> 47:53.800
I, like I said on Coder Radio, I don't like it.

47:53.800 --> 47:59.880
I think the having Windows on it was awfully not good for open source and it seems like

47:59.880 --> 48:05.960
the first step in Microsoft's whole, um, the three years I'm not remembering off the top

48:05.960 --> 48:06.960
of my head.

48:06.960 --> 48:07.960
Embrace.

48:07.960 --> 48:08.960
Extend.

48:08.960 --> 48:09.960
Extinguish.

48:09.960 --> 48:10.960
Yeah, exactly.

48:10.960 --> 48:11.960
Uh, yeah.

48:11.960 --> 48:12.960
I guess so.

48:12.960 --> 48:13.960
I don't think so.

48:13.960 --> 48:14.960
I think it's actually going to make Microsoft look like a chump.

48:14.960 --> 48:16.440
I think it's going to be a clown show.

48:16.440 --> 48:17.980
They're going to show up late to the party.

48:17.980 --> 48:19.600
They don't even have shipping code right now.

48:19.600 --> 48:20.600
Right?

48:20.600 --> 48:21.600
Linux has already had shipping code for years.

48:21.600 --> 48:23.600
They have a totally mature ecosystem around it.

48:23.600 --> 48:25.280
Uh, Windows is going to come to the party.

48:25.280 --> 48:26.660
Is it even going to have a GUI?

48:26.660 --> 48:29.040
Do we even know if it'll have a GUI or is it just going to be a command line version

48:29.040 --> 48:30.040
of Windows?

48:30.040 --> 48:31.040
What's it going to run?

48:31.040 --> 48:32.400
What apps is it going to run?

48:32.400 --> 48:34.880
Who's going to make apps for Windows on an, on one arm device?

48:34.880 --> 48:38.000
Now it's not going to be one arm device for long, but let's be serious.

48:38.000 --> 48:42.820
It's like Raspberry Pi is running Linux or production ready to be like the glue that

48:42.820 --> 48:46.260
holds the internet of things together or like this weird web server that runs your coffee

48:46.260 --> 48:49.400
machine or like this thing that's your XBMC media entertainment system.

48:49.400 --> 48:51.280
We've been there for a while now, right?

48:51.280 --> 48:52.880
Windows 10 showing up way late.

48:52.880 --> 48:54.880
It's like everything Microsoft does.

48:54.880 --> 48:58.040
They're just way late these days and it's, it's going to, you know, a few people will

48:58.040 --> 48:59.040
use it.

48:59.040 --> 49:01.160
It'll probably show up at few high schools for, you know, a few high school teachers

49:01.160 --> 49:03.460
will use it and you know, students will, it's fine.

49:03.460 --> 49:04.460
It's fine.

49:04.460 --> 49:05.760
But it's not, it's not serious.

49:05.760 --> 49:06.760
I'm not worried about it at all.

49:06.760 --> 49:09.240
I think it's going to be a joke.

49:09.240 --> 49:12.880
I do like the irony of the fact that you're pointing out, Hey, Hey, has it even got a

49:12.880 --> 49:13.880
GUI?

49:13.880 --> 49:15.120
Isn't it just a command line version?

49:15.120 --> 49:17.120
Which is exactly what they used to say to us.

49:17.120 --> 49:22.440
Well, here's why I bring that up because there is an expectation with windows, right?

49:22.440 --> 49:23.440
With Linux.

49:23.440 --> 49:27.720
That's maybe the advantage on a raspberry PI is no GUI, but with windows, like you tell

49:27.720 --> 49:31.560
me I can run windows 10 on it while I'm starting to get a picture of the modern UI and my start

49:31.560 --> 49:32.560
menu.

49:32.560 --> 49:34.440
Like I'm starting to visualize or windows.

49:34.440 --> 49:35.440
Yeah.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.120
But people are using the raspberry PI for the wrong thing.

49:37.120 --> 49:40.200
They're using it as a cheap computer, cheap desktop computer, and that's just not what

49:40.200 --> 49:41.800
the raspberry PI was about.

49:41.800 --> 49:45.560
It was about teaching people how to program, teaching people how to code.

49:45.560 --> 49:50.520
It's not about running a desktop operating system and browsing Facebook on a cheap computer.

49:50.520 --> 49:51.520
Yeah.

49:51.520 --> 49:55.960
No, I guess that's what a stream PCs and Chromebooks are for.

49:55.960 --> 49:58.640
Mr. Q5 Sys, you're a resident raspberry PI fan.

49:58.640 --> 50:02.520
What are your thoughts on the new fancy raspberry PI?

50:02.520 --> 50:06.120
For me, it's too little too late.

50:06.120 --> 50:10.520
As I mentioned in Coder Radio, I don't see why anyone would go out and buy this if they're

50:10.520 --> 50:14.120
actually looking for a decent system other than if you're just already a raspberry PI

50:14.120 --> 50:15.880
fan.

50:15.880 --> 50:20.340
The raspberry PI 2 specs are actually less than what you can get if you get the Odroid

50:20.340 --> 50:22.720
C1 and they're the exact same price.

50:22.720 --> 50:24.080
They're actually even the same form factor.

50:24.080 --> 50:27.240
You can use the same cases and accessories between them.

50:27.240 --> 50:32.480
The raspberry PI 2 does come with the quad core 900 megahertz chip, which people have

50:32.480 --> 50:37.240
claimed will reach 1.1 with a mild overclock.

50:37.240 --> 50:43.600
Whereas the Odroid C1, it comes at 1.5 gigahertz, still a quad core, but it's been overclocked

50:43.600 --> 50:45.920
to 1.7.

50:45.920 --> 50:51.000
For me, the biggest drawback on the RPI 2, the raspberry PI 2, is that it's still a hundred

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
megabit networking.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.160
The Odroid C1 has gigabit.

50:56.160 --> 50:59.800
Now it's not a full absolute hundred percent gigabit.

50:59.800 --> 51:05.880
I actually reached out to Jason, the lead developer with the Arch Linux ARM port and

51:05.880 --> 51:08.920
talked to him and he's talked with the hard kernel devs.

51:08.920 --> 51:13.480
He was trying to get me the actual throughput from them before today's show, but kind of

51:13.480 --> 51:15.760
had a communication disconnect.

51:15.760 --> 51:22.800
He said that in his recollection that with iperf that the Odroid C1 will do 400 megabit

51:22.800 --> 51:26.480
up and 900 down.

51:26.480 --> 51:27.480
The NIC is a big thing.

51:27.480 --> 51:31.040
It seems like the NIC is the full gigabit, it's just the processor can't handle the

51:31.040 --> 51:32.040
event stuff.

51:32.040 --> 51:36.820
There might be some optimizations you can do there, some tuning that can happen later

51:36.820 --> 51:38.640
on that might improve that.

51:38.640 --> 51:43.440
The biggest question that's been going around in raspberry PI circles itself is, why did

51:43.440 --> 51:48.540
they drop this raspberry PI 2 just a few months after they dropped the B+, because we all

51:48.540 --> 51:52.120
went out and just bought the B+, because it was the newest one and now, oh look, there's

51:52.120 --> 51:56.360
another one and this is what we wanted to buy, but they didn't give it to us.

51:56.360 --> 52:01.220
Here's where some good old conspiracy bacon comes in, because there's two prevailing theories.

52:01.220 --> 52:05.080
One is that they took a page from Apple's handbook and put out the B+, so everybody

52:05.080 --> 52:06.080
went out and bought it.

52:06.080 --> 52:10.520
Then when everyone realized that it had shortcomings, they then released the actual item which everybody

52:10.520 --> 52:13.600
wanted, so everybody would go out and buy it the second time.

52:13.600 --> 52:19.600
The second theory is that the raspberry PI 2 was actually slated for a later release,

52:19.600 --> 52:25.960
either later this year or early 2016, and the reason that the raspberry PI foundation

52:25.960 --> 52:31.240
pushed it forward was to try to actually take back any market segment that Odroid would

52:31.240 --> 52:33.120
claim with their C1 device.

52:33.120 --> 52:35.320
Hmm, I mean, I don't know-

52:35.320 --> 52:41.120
I imagine the B+, was probably later than intended, and then because of other things

52:41.120 --> 52:44.720
like, you know, we saw the BeagleBone and there's like a hundred of these little devices

52:44.720 --> 52:47.160
now that they decided to try to rush the-

52:47.160 --> 52:48.160
Yeah, and I mean-

52:48.160 --> 52:50.120
I don't buy it at all.

52:50.120 --> 52:53.200
The PI 2 has been under development for a while now.

52:53.200 --> 52:59.520
They've been working on that with Microsoft and with other partners as well for some time.

52:59.520 --> 53:08.200
I don't buy that there's a significant competition from the Odroid at all.

53:08.200 --> 53:14.240
I think Odroid is big in geek circles, but Raspberry Pi have a massive mindshare in the

53:14.240 --> 53:17.520
educational sector, which is where they target.

53:17.520 --> 53:18.520
Well and I just want to-

53:18.520 --> 53:19.520
Yeah, and I think-

53:19.520 --> 53:22.400
I want to just mention, we're not talking about $400 iPads, we're talking about $35

53:22.400 --> 53:23.400
Raspberry Pis.

53:23.400 --> 53:28.960
Yeah, and I think that is why Windows is kind of getting involved, is because they're looking

53:28.960 --> 53:32.600
at this as something that they can bundle and package for education.

53:32.600 --> 53:37.780
They can get a bunch of them, have a Windows version for it, and sell thousands and thousands

53:37.780 --> 53:43.280
of them direct to school boards, school systems as, here's something you can deploy, instead

53:43.280 --> 53:49.080
of going buy these units by yourself and then you go ahead and set them up and do all that.

53:49.080 --> 53:52.000
That's where I worry about Microsoft coming in, because they've got the money and resources

53:52.000 --> 53:55.960
to kind of do a complete package like that to sell them and market them in mass quantities

53:55.960 --> 54:02.000
and they can work with a reseller and that's a little bit harder for the Linux side.

54:02.000 --> 54:06.120
But I think when you look at the momentum where Linux is the platform that runs across

54:06.120 --> 54:09.440
all these different devices, not just Raspberry Pi, it's got the years of development ahead

54:09.440 --> 54:10.440
of Windows.

54:10.440 --> 54:14.960
Just the momentum there will keep the Raspberry Pi running Linux in the majority forever,

54:14.960 --> 54:15.960
I think.

54:15.960 --> 54:16.960
But I agree.

54:16.960 --> 54:19.840
I think there are going to be some areas that are susceptible to Windows running on the

54:19.840 --> 54:23.960
Pi because of Microsoft's ability to organize those kinds of things.

54:23.960 --> 54:27.600
Well it does seem like it's something that's old platform.

54:27.600 --> 54:32.240
The integration with their platform, there will be developers out there who are already

54:32.240 --> 54:38.640
.NET developers using Visual Studio on Windows and they want something which is a portable

54:38.640 --> 54:42.860
embedded system and the first place they turn is Windows.

54:42.860 --> 54:44.400
So for them it's perfect.

54:44.400 --> 54:48.080
For people like us where the first place we turn is, right, what can I find that runs

54:48.080 --> 54:49.080
Linux?

54:49.080 --> 54:53.640
They'll go, you'll go Odroid, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black and a whole bunch of others

54:53.640 --> 54:55.560
and we've got a lot of options.

54:55.560 --> 54:59.520
Raspberry Pi seems to be the only option if Windows is what you want.

54:59.520 --> 55:00.520
For now at least.

55:00.520 --> 55:01.520
I can't imagine that'll last.

55:01.520 --> 55:06.600
Well then there's the Intel Minnow board and a couple of others but there's not a huge

55:06.600 --> 55:09.880
selection, nowhere near as huge a selection as we have.

55:09.880 --> 55:12.960
We have a lot more choice there, which is ironic really.

55:12.960 --> 55:17.440
I think that this is just the first step since Nadea has come on board with Microsoft.

55:17.440 --> 55:22.000
They seem to be back in their habit of looking to the long term goals and not just the short

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
term things.

55:23.000 --> 55:27.240
And I think that on the Raspberry Pi 2 that this is Microsoft's perhaps their first step

55:27.240 --> 55:28.600
into the ARM market.

55:28.600 --> 55:34.080
I fully expect them to create more trimmed down versions for some of the older Raspberry

55:34.080 --> 55:37.840
Pis and I wouldn't be surprised if they don't actually put out a version for some of the

55:37.840 --> 55:43.800
stronger ARM boards out there like the new NVIDIA TK1 that has the Tegra CPU and a hundred

55:43.800 --> 55:48.480
and ninety two CUDA cores and it's, you know, system on a chip, small board, small form

55:48.480 --> 55:49.480
factor.

55:49.480 --> 55:53.160
Could be, yeah, could well.

55:53.160 --> 55:55.720
All right Colonel Linux, you have something you wanted to add.

55:55.720 --> 55:59.640
I just wanted to get in there that every other time in history when Microsoft has tried to

55:59.640 --> 56:02.760
scale Windows down, they've always seemed to fail.

56:02.760 --> 56:06.640
Like when they try and put it into like Windows CE or Windows Mobile, those kind of things

56:06.640 --> 56:07.640
don't seem to work.

56:07.640 --> 56:12.540
Whereas Linux has always been, because it by nature it exists very, very small and we

56:12.540 --> 56:16.880
scale it up to meet needs and that has always seemed to work very well but when we need

56:16.880 --> 56:21.360
it to remain small, when we need it to be able to fit on a small embedded device, it's

56:21.360 --> 56:22.640
always done very, very well.

56:22.640 --> 56:23.640
Very true.

56:23.640 --> 56:26.800
It seems to be, you know, the fundamental way Windows is built.

56:26.800 --> 56:30.480
They have to tear it down to make it work whereas Linux, you build it up, you build

56:30.480 --> 56:31.480
up.

56:31.480 --> 56:32.480
Right.

56:32.480 --> 56:37.400
And that approach is even apparent like I definitely noticed that as a difference in

56:37.400 --> 56:41.920
philosophy when I switched from Windows administration to Linux administration full time and the

56:41.920 --> 56:46.760
security model back then on Windows was sort of open by default, secure one by one by going

56:46.760 --> 56:50.160
through a checklist of group policy settings and all these kinds of things and on Linux

56:50.160 --> 56:53.780
it was ports are closed by default and you open them up when you need them and those

56:53.780 --> 56:54.780
kinds of things.

56:54.780 --> 56:58.000
It's the same kind of philosophy only in how the whole system is built.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.840
We'll see.

56:59.840 --> 57:03.740
So I'm not too worried about it but guys, any other thoughts on the new Raspberry Pi

57:03.740 --> 57:06.540
or Windows running on Windows 10?

57:06.540 --> 57:07.540
Not even out here.

57:07.540 --> 57:10.160
I've ordered one so I'll let you know when it arrives in a couple of days.

57:10.160 --> 57:11.160
I want one too.

57:11.160 --> 57:12.160
I was tempted by it too.

57:12.160 --> 57:15.120
I'm just not sure what I would use it for.

57:15.120 --> 57:19.800
The really nice thing about the whole thing is that the VC4 driver that so much work has

57:19.800 --> 57:24.240
been pushed into is going to work on the Pi 2 because that is the one thing that when

57:24.240 --> 57:28.320
I heard the Pi 2 I thought, oh my goodness, I hope that they don't just throw all that

57:28.320 --> 57:32.680
work that someone did reverse engineering the Pi's graphics for nothing and it's going

57:32.680 --> 57:34.320
to be there.

57:34.320 --> 57:39.120
So it's improved graphics though but it's just the same driver?

57:39.120 --> 57:40.120
It's a free graphics driver.

57:40.120 --> 57:46.920
The VC4 is the reverse engineered open source graphics driver that was made for the Pi.

57:46.920 --> 57:51.200
Well, if anybody out there tries it with Windows 10 let us know how it goes, I guess.

57:51.200 --> 57:52.200
Go to jupyterbroadcasting.com.

57:52.200 --> 57:56.200
Hey, that would be a good spot to send in any kind of feedback for the Linux Unplugged

57:56.200 --> 57:57.200
show.

57:57.200 --> 57:58.200
Just go over there.

57:58.200 --> 57:59.200
Send it in to us.

57:59.200 --> 58:00.200
That's a good idea.

58:00.200 --> 58:02.680
I kind of want one, Matt, but maybe if I could come up with a good segment idea.

58:02.680 --> 58:05.360
I think that $55 isn't bad.

58:05.360 --> 58:09.280
It's not bad and I think honestly you want to set it in front of people that aren't geeky,

58:09.280 --> 58:12.880
that perhaps are thinking, yeah, you know, I could use a new computer but I don't have,

58:12.880 --> 58:17.840
you know, $500 to spend, if you can park it in front of someone that really gets value

58:17.840 --> 58:19.720
from it, that would be really cool to see.

58:19.720 --> 58:23.040
If it really is six times the performance, too?

58:23.040 --> 58:24.440
Well, how many cores did it?

58:24.440 --> 58:25.440
It was like...

58:25.440 --> 58:26.440
Four, yeah.

58:26.440 --> 58:27.440
Four, yeah.

58:27.440 --> 58:28.440
At 900 megahertz.

58:28.440 --> 58:31.680
Yeah, I mean, it just depends on what kind of a desktop environment you're running and

58:31.680 --> 58:32.680
how you're rocking.

58:32.680 --> 58:33.920
Yeah, yeah.

58:33.920 --> 58:35.920
And how it launches the browser.

58:35.920 --> 58:38.800
Yeah, that's how Facebook pages load, right?

58:38.800 --> 58:39.800
That's what's going to be...

58:39.800 --> 58:40.800
That's right.

58:40.800 --> 58:44.480
But I look at this and I think, you know, the Pi itself was already a pretty competent

58:44.480 --> 58:45.480
media machine.

58:45.480 --> 58:48.680
You give it something more performance, I think that could be something really interesting

58:48.680 --> 58:49.680
here.

58:49.680 --> 58:54.200
Well, and you bundle that with YouTube switch to HTML5 from Flash, thank God.

58:54.200 --> 58:55.200
Yeah.

58:55.200 --> 58:58.240
You know, it's like a little bit easier on the arm side, doesn't it?

58:58.240 --> 58:59.240
It does.

58:59.240 --> 59:00.240
Yes, it does.

59:00.240 --> 59:01.240
Interesting.

59:01.240 --> 59:02.240
Well, there you go.

59:02.240 --> 59:03.240
All right.

59:03.240 --> 59:05.320
So if you'd like to help contribute to any of our shows, there's a couple of ways you

59:05.320 --> 59:07.400
can do it and we'd love to have you help.

59:07.400 --> 59:11.680
Something I don't mention too often on this show, but as we are spinning up the How To

59:11.680 --> 59:14.880
Linux show, we'll be funding the launch of that via our Patreon.

59:14.880 --> 59:18.840
We decided initially that we're not going to do sponsorships on the new show.

59:18.840 --> 59:22.240
We've had offers too, which is super rewarding to have sponsors just sort of preemptively

59:22.240 --> 59:23.760
say, hey, we'd love to sponsor that.

59:23.760 --> 59:27.800
But what we've decided to do is be genuine to just as tight of a focus on the content

59:27.800 --> 59:29.080
as we can initially.

59:29.080 --> 59:32.000
And we have some runway because of our Patreon model.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
This is...

59:33.000 --> 59:34.760
The Jupiter Broadcasting Network is sort of multi-funded.

59:34.760 --> 59:38.440
We have sponsors and then we have the audience funding.

59:38.440 --> 59:43.760
And that gives a sort of leverage to opt not to have sponsors or be picky with the sponsors

59:43.760 --> 59:46.480
and sometimes launch shows without sponsors.

59:46.480 --> 59:49.680
And we could do that even more if we have more support.

59:49.680 --> 59:52.960
We're kind of getting to a point where we need a little more help from the community

59:52.960 --> 59:55.680
to take on some of the future expenses like How To Linux.

59:55.680 --> 59:59.760
And we may eventually, depending on how that show goes, if it really sees a lot of traction,

59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.740
spin that off into its own Patreon just so that way that's sort of easily distinguished

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:04.740
all on its own.

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:07.760
But initially, as we sort of get things going and we take that cost on, we could use your

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:10.760
help over at patreon.com slash today.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.000
You have the Tech Talk Today video on there, but this funds all of the shows on the network

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.360
and Tech Talk Today is a daily tech show that I do to sort of say thank you to the patrons.

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.180
There's also behind the scenes videos over there, including the death of the last Hackintosh

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:26.360
in the Jupiter Broadcasting Studio is available to people who support us over at patreon.com

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.360
slash today.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:29.420
So that's one way, direct value right there.

01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:31.260
That's obviously another way you can...

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.680
That's like the most direct way you can support us.

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:37.520
You can also help content-wise, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:41.160
Submit links, app suggestions, comments, and votes.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:45.900
That feeds both the Linux Action Show and that feeds Linux Unplugged and in some ways

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:48.000
it also is going to be feeding How To Linux.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.960
So that's a really important nexus point you can go that helps contribute to all of the

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.720
shows, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:54.760
You can also join us live.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:01:00.280
We do the show live Tuesdays, Pacific over at jblive.tv and you can go to jupiterbroadcasting.com

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.800
slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.000
I'd love to have you join us.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
We have an open mumble room.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.840
We call it our virtual lug and it's available to you to come take advantage and tell us

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.280
about the things that are on your mind in the Linux ecosystem.

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.860
We also do pre and post shows where it's just kind of an open mic and we chat.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:19.640
So jblive.tv, you can go in there, get the mumble room information and join us.

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.660
Also hang out in the chatroom, help name the show.

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:24.920
It's a good experience and it happens every single freaking Tuesday.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.480
We'll do episode 79 next week, Matt.

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:29.480
Are you feeling like 80 around the horizon?

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.700
I'm feeling it a little bit.

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.200
It does feel like it.

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.720
I have days to where I feel 80, but it'll be nice to celebrate 80 in a more positive

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:36.720
light.

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.720
Oh wait.

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.720
Nope.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:39.720
You know what?

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:40.720
That was a little gas.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.720
I'm sorry.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:42.720
I thought that was 80.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:43.720
That was just a little bit of gas.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:44.720
All right, everybody.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.720
Well, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.720
Go over to the contact page, send us in your feedback.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:02:05.320
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:23.040
Okay, chatroom, it's your last chance.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040
Go bang suggest.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.360
Get your title suggestions in there while you still can.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.960
We'll go boat here in a minute.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:30.960
Go boat.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.960
Go boat, everybody.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.880
Hey, I saw a really cool video.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:38.600
It doesn't work so well in audio, but Popey, I don't know if you're, are you still here?

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.600
Yep.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.920
So I saw this great video that makes me want an Ubuntu tablet real bad.

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:44.920
Hang on.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:47.880
I'm just, I'm not actually watching the livestream, so that's okay.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:48.880
It's all right.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:53.240
It's a, so, uh, pop pop you sore in or whatever, pop you sore in whatever his name is.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.240
Oh yes.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.240
Yeah.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.240
Uh, he made a video.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.240
Uh, let's see.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.200
When did he post this on the video?

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.200
Yeah.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.200
Yesterday.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.200
Yeah.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.200
This is really great.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.200
So watch those of you watching the video version.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.200
It's it will be linked in the, if you're on the audio, but he sort of fades in.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.040
He realizes running on the desktop and then he expands the app out and I'll just kind

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.040
of re expands.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.040
I like it.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.040
It's nice.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.760
It's still a little touchy, but it's a nicely edited video.

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:15.760
Actually.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.560
It gets me fired up states of the app.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.560
Yeah.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.560
That's good.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.440
That's exactly the kind of advocacy you need because people, you know, they can wrap their

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.440
brains around it.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.440
It looks really good.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.800
There's basically two guys who wrote that app, but that music app, Andrew and Victor

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:33.680
wrote that with some designs from the design team.

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.000
It's I just love what they're doing.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Yeah.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
That is really good.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.160
So I will, uh, I'll have a link to that in the post-show show notes.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:43.160
If people want to watch that and I'll drop in the chat right now.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.160
All right.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.160
Okay.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.160
JBtitles.com.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.160
We got a vote on this thing.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:55.160
Chris, that bitwig demo is a 145 megabyte depth file for Ubuntu, just so you know.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.160
I'm sorry.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.160
Did I laugh out loud?

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:58.160
My bad.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.160
No, I'm sure it's an upstream.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.160
Probably arch it up.

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.160
Pretty easy.

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.160
Oh yeah.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.480
Uh, okay.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.480
So pie to win.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:05.480
That's not too bad.

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.480
FOSDM nerd herds.

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.640
That's not bad.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.640
Straight out of FOSDM.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:09.640
Oh, I kind of like that.

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:10.640
Yeah.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.640
I got to get a beat going.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:12.640
I kind of like that.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.640
That's kind of straight out of FOSDM.

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:14.640
A little bit of NWA going on there.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.640
Yeah.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.640
Yeah.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.640
I could see that.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:18.640
All right.

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:19.640
Go over the titles.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.640
Go vote, everybody.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.640
We got to get you a grill.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.640
Got to get you a grill.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.640
There we go.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.640
Mm-hmm.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.640
Yeah.

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.640
It's going up to the top of the charts right there.

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:27.640
There it is.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:28.640
Very nice.

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:29.640
Very nice.

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:30.640
All right, guys.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.200
Well, I think we're going to go with that.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.080
Boy, that was one of our easier titles.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.240
That was really easy, actually.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.240
Something I didn't mention there.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.760
Have you ever seen a key signing party?

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.480
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:42.480
They do those there?

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.840
Yeah, that was a massive key signing party.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.000
It was going for like two hours.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.480
I went into a talk and came out and the people were still there.

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.480
They're standing in a line.

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:51.480
Yeah.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.480
Right.

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:57.000
So imagine like two lines of people facing each other, like some kind of weird country

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.840
dancing thing, right, where they're facing each other and they've all got these little

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:05.240
notepads and they've all got their government issued ID and they've all got their like printouts

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.840
of their keys and stuff.

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:12.280
And when they've done, when they've done someone, they just moved down the line to the next

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.280
one.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:16.240
And they were just there for ages and ages, all these people signing each other's keys.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.240
It was amazing.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.240
Yeah, that's a good way to do it.

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:21.560
I wonder if Keybase.io would help with that.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:22.560
Yeah, maybe.

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:23.560
All right.

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:24.560
Well, I guess it's time to put my pants back on.

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:25.560
Yeah, that'd be a good time.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.560
Yeah.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.560
All right, guys.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.560
Thanks very much.

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:29.560
Good show.

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:30.560
Cheers, Chris.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:42.640
See you next week.
