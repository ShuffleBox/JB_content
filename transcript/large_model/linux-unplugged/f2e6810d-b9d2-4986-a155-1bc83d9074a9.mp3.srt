1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
What's new with Wimpy and Poppy these days?

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,080
Working in the same room.

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:03,920
Oh, really?

4
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,800
Now, are you going to Wimpy's co-located space?

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,800
Yes.

6
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,400
It's bizarre.

7
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,560
Very weird.

8
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,600
Very weird place.

9
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,720
Oh, really?

10
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,200
This place has different themes, right?

11
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,440
Yeah.

12
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,760
We sat in the boat theme.

13
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,200
So it was like a pirate ship with distressed wood

14
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,840
and rigging and sails and stuff.

15
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,240
It was very bizarre.

16
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,040
But just across the way was Narnia.

17
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,920
And there was an open space with sofas.

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,720
And there were people sat there with their feet up,

19
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,120
with their shoes off, just like they're

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,920
lounging around at home on the sofa with a laptop.

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,640
It's very chilled.

22
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,360
I like it.

23
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,280
That sounds really cool.

24
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,400
I did see some pictures.

25
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,680
And I thought that was, I think, that Wimpy posted.

26
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,360
Yeah, it's nice.

27
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,760
And it was lovely to have Alan there in person today.

28
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,520
Oh, still.

29
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,240
Oh, I bet you're doing it tomorrow.

30
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,640
Gazing into your beautiful green eyes

31
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,640
across the table of the pirate ship.

32
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,080
When you take that out of context,

33
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,160
it really makes no sense.

34
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,760
That makes no sense at all.

35
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,920
I'm going to speak to HR tomorrow.

36
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:21,720
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 264 for August 28, 2018.

37
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,560
Hi, everyone, and welcome to Linux Unplugged,

38
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,120
Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly Linux talk show

39
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,360
that this week is optimizing the market for Linux.

40
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,760
I'm not quite sure, but we're going

41
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,980
to figure out what that means.

42
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,840
My name is Chris.

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,160
My name is Wes.

44
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,560
We'll be getting into the optimizing of markets

45
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,480
and the new support coming to LVFS,

46
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,000
as well as some big features that landed in Ubuntu Touch,

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,240
some nice things coming to KDE, benchmarks

48
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,960
that can't be benchmarked that then got benchmarked.

49
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,720
And then we'll have the big discussion

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,400
about what the heck Proton is, what Steam Play is,

51
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,720
what CodeWeaver's involvement with all of that is,

52
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,320
and what shift has actually just happened.

53
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,320
So we'll get all of that into the show as well.

54
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,720
It's going to be a packed episode,

55
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,440
so perhaps there will be some optimizing for market in there.

56
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,760
Well, we're yet to determine.

57
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,240
And like every great episode of the Unplugged program,

58
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,480
we've got that virtual log.

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,280
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

60
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,780
Hello.

61
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,280
Hello.

62
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,780
Thank you.

63
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,640
Greetings.

64
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,680
Hello.

65
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,560
Brent is joining us via the Mumble Room today.

66
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,400
So if you didn't hear his voice specifically,

67
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,840
he is in there.

68
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,160
Guys, it's great to be connected with all of you.

69
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,360
And I'm looking at the news this week.

70
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
And the thing I thought maybe we'd start with,

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,140
because it didn't really fit with the rest of the theme,

72
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,640
but I think it's a fascinating story,

73
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,760
is this story from Fedora that looks

74
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,880
like they've moved ahead with plans

75
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,520
to start dropping packages that have essentially

76
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,920
bad security practices.

77
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,560
They're drawn a line, and they're

78
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,720
saying this line no farther.

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,520
And it appears to be aimed at removing packages

80
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,280
from the Fedora package archive that

81
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,880
have known security issues against them that are not

82
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,080
getting addressed in a timely manner.

83
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,680
Now, you might be thinking, doesn't that already happen?

84
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,280
If it's a critical or important security issue,

85
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,960
and it's currently open against a package,

86
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,560
or a security issue of lower severity

87
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,680
has been open for at least six months,

88
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,240
four weeks before the branch point,

89
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,360
a procedure similar to some longstanding trimming

90
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,320
procedures will be called into effect,

91
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,120
and the package will be removed from the distribution.

92
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,120
Is Cinnamon an official spin of the Fedora project?

93
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,840
I don't know.

94
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,120
That's a good question.

95
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,360
Well, you think this might apply to them?

96
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,120
Well, I'm not one to cast stones, but yeah, totally could.

97
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
Well, that's actually where I was going, is I

98
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,880
was thinking of XFCE or other projects that perhaps just

99
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,240
have this really torrentially long lead

100
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,920
time between updates.

101
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,920
They could get caught up in this, couldn't they?

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,560
Well, technically, although they've

103
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,880
been in a round of updating their code bases,

104
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,160
so a lot of their stuff is moving to 4.13,

105
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,160
and what isn't has had other updates.

106
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,400
Yeah, them specifically.

107
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,040
Yeah, XFCE specifically.

108
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,640
No, I don't think so.

109
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,560
I think they'll be fine, because what isn't already GTK3

110
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,360
is built on top of GTK2 and its associated technologies

111
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,680
and has stood the test of time.

112
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,760
I think they'll be fine.

113
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,480
It seems like, too, it probably matters

114
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,480
what sort of application, because if you

115
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,760
have to get to the critical or important level of security

116
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,000
issue, there might be some low hanging fruit of minor security

117
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,720
problems for some of our favorite desktop applications

118
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,440
that haven't been updated in a while.

119
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,640
That's much less of a big deal than an obvious flaw

120
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,360
in something that's doing a lot of network

121
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,840
traffic or functioning in a server aspect, right?

122
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,320
So I can see why Fedora wants to make sure

123
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,200
that people can trust stuff coming from their archives.

124
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,720
If it's just an out of date program on your desktop,

125
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,820
well, maybe I care less.

126
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,240
I do feel like this is a big part of the end user being

127
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,960
able to trust what's in that repo.

128
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,480
That's what this is really about is increasing confidence

129
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,920
there and improving security.

130
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,480
And this seems like a pretty easy way

131
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,920
to automate that process that doesn't require a human being

132
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,720
to go through and flag a project and then run a stopwatch

133
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,220
and then come back and check on it.

134
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,160
Like this is something computers can be pretty good at.

135
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,800
It's also good to have clear guidelines

136
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,040
so that downstream projects can be like, well,

137
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,000
why was I removed?

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,880
Well, here's our clear policy.

139
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,840
OK, well, speaking of things that are getting better,

140
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,680
LLVFS is having a banner couple of months.

141
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,280
This is becoming more and more irresistible of a project

142
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,180
to be involved with if you are in the hardware business that

143
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,960
sells to Linux users.

144
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,160
Some people still are.

145
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,400
But boy, is it getting harder.

146
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,320
And Realtek couldn't say no.

147
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,900
In fact, it looks like they may have been happy to say yes.

148
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,040
Realtek engineers are adding USB 3.0 hub firmware support

149
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,000
to FW-upd.

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,920
A lot of these multi-function USB-C dongles that you see,

151
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,840
like I've got one that's got ethernet and HDMI on it,

152
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,160
as well as a couple of USB-A ports.

153
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,760
And those are actually, in most cases,

154
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,880
connected internally with USB themselves to each other,

155
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,120
like another hub inside your hub.

156
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,840
It's a bit of a hot mess.

157
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,480
So there's different subcomponents

158
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,920
that need to be updated.

159
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,440
And that is what these, so the Realtek chips that

160
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,040
are in there is what LVFS is getting support for.

161
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,000
And they're working on getting also support

162
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,120
to update the HDMI controllers that are Realtek as well.

163
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,260
And in a nice turn of events, some

164
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,680
of the hardware that's getting supported here hasn't even

165
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,600
been released yet.

166
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,760
So we're getting to the point with the project

167
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,440
where, in some cases, vendors have at least enough awareness

168
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,400
of this project, like Realtek did,

169
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,440
to start working with them before the hardware is even out.

170
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,800
And that's really great, because it means when you get

171
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,240
the hardware, it's just going to work out of the box

172
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,240
with your Linux machine.

173
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,020
That's huge.

174
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,920
Yeah, there's quite a lot of momentum around LVFS right now.

175
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,600
And it's really great to see.

176
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,240
It's at a tipping point, I think, and a good year ahead

177
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,960
for the Linux desktop with LVFS.

178
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,760
Yeah, the project really does seem to be picking up steam.

179
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,280
And I wonder if maybe other vendors in the past

180
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,400
have said it's not enough of a priority for us

181
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,440
to fight with upstream ODM or to reinvent our internal process.

182
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,400
Maybe now those decisions will be re-examined.

183
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,160
I don't know.

184
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,920
But we'll wait and see, I suppose.

185
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,200
So the good news for the project,

186
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,080
lots of really great hard work.

187
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,320
And it's really good to see them just

188
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,040
roll this kind of stuff out.

189
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,400
And speaking of really hard work,

190
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,680
the chaps over at Ubiports have been plugging away

191
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,720
like machines and have just released OTA 4.

192
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,400
And Marius joins us from the project

193
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,840
to tell us a little bit about it.

194
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,360
First of all, congratulations on the new release, Marius.

195
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,200
And I noted that you say this is the official starting

196
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,080
point of the project.

197
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,440
That's sort of the messaging here.

198
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,280
What does that mean?

199
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,960
Well, it basically means this is where

200
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,520
we have used the time to catch up and get to our LTS base

201
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,640
and a still supported base.

202
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:09,360
So now we are on 16.04 LTS base instead of the old vivid of 15.04

203
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,080
as it was before.

204
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,720
And that's what we mean with the starting point

205
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,560
is that we have used so long to both build the infrastructure

206
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,680
and build the build tools and build up a community.

207
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,240
And now we are finally to a point

208
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,600
where we can see everything is going smoothly

209
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,840
in the development process.

210
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,600
And we are at a point where we are on LTS, which is huge.

211
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,400
Congratulations.

212
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,680
And does it feel like it's fully yours now?

213
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,880
Like this is a community project now.

214
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,880
It's an independent thing.

215
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,920
Yeah, I would say that.

216
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,440
But it's still based on Ubuntu.

217
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,080
So we are really, really tied with the Ubuntu ecosystem.

218
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,080
And I really like that, being tied to a strong base.

219
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,600
So I wouldn't say we're independent in that way.

220
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,320
But we're independent in a way that we are doing something

221
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,760
new, which is a community-based mobile operating

222
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,480
system, which is purely community

223
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,280
without any official backing or a company behind it.

224
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,840
It's a project for the rest of us

225
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,240
to perhaps one day have the option to put life into a device

226
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,520
or replace the operating system on a device.

227
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,280
And it's not tied to one individual manufacturer.

228
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,200
It's not tied to one individual strategic partner.

229
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,040
It's making a people's operating system for our mobile devices

230
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,080
like they should be, like you can do with an x86 PC.

231
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,200
And you make a good point that it's still totally based

232
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,920
on that Ubuntu technology.

233
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,680
But it does feel as its own independent organism now,

234
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,280
like its own independent thing that, like you say,

235
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,840
is doing something new.

236
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,640
Speaking of new, I noticed in this new release

237
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,800
there are some new power-saving features and also

238
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,120
a new upgrade wizard.

239
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,880
Let's start with the power-saving stuff.

240
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,800
What's happening there?

241
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,120
Is that savings that you see because of kernel updates?

242
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,040
Are there other tweaks that have taken place?

243
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,680
This is tweaks that we have done to utilize the wake logs

244
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,880
or the Android wake logs, which is the power saving, which

245
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,160
is kernel-based from Android.

246
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,200
And since these kernel patches or these kernel APIs

247
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,320
are really, really optimized for phones,

248
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,680
it was a good idea to use those wake logs in an efficient way

249
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,320
as it was designed to.

250
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,120
So that's what we have done now.

251
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,720
We used those wake logs properly.

252
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,520
And we're really heavily based on the thing when the process

253
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,040
or when the phone is not in use, we

254
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,080
want to enable those wake logs so the processor goes down

255
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,880
to sleep and just keeps one core intact.

256
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,160
That is cool.

257
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,920
And then there's that upgrade wizard,

258
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,720
which I didn't see that one coming.

259
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,160
But I guess it does make sense if you

260
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,960
want to keep the same core install,

261
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,040
you should be able to.

262
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,520
Right.

263
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,240
So we are currently on a rolling release type.

264
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,080
And the problem with that that we saw

265
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,240
is app compatibility or app ABI compatibility

266
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,760
because some of the apps are compiled for Vivid.

267
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,560
And when we update to Senior, we had the issue

268
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,760
where the apps was not compatible because of New York

269
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,040
Qt version, et cetera, et cetera.

270
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,560
So what this wizard does is basically

271
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,640
update all these apps for you once you have upgraded

272
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,320
the system to a new base.

273
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
This won't happen on every OTA.

274
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,360
This is just for major, we call it framework change.

275
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,160
So it's not something that comes up on every OTA.

276
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,080
With the switch to a 16.04 base, what

277
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,080
does that unlock in terms of things

278
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,120
you want to achieve that you weren't able to do

279
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,600
whilst you were based on 15.04?

280
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,080
The major thing is definitely being

281
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,080
able to get security patches upstream to still

282
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,180
be on a supported base.

283
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,320
I think that's one of the major thing.

284
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,640
But there is other things like being

285
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,280
able to run Andbox, which was not

286
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,960
able to run on Vivid because of all the version of STL

287
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,200
and all these libraries that they use,

288
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,760
and also newer version of Mesa, a newer version of Mirror,

289
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,280
and all these things that we want to upgrade at some point.

290
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,760
We need a newer version of pretty much everything.

291
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,280
And since Mirror is now targeted at Senior,

292
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,440
we don't have to backport things to Vivid.

293
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,160
The Mirror team will make sure it builds on Senior.

294
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,320
Excellent, thank you.

295
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,760
So let's shift to hardware for a second.

296
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,640
I notice that things seem to be working pretty well on the OnePlus

297
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,840
with maybe the exception of camera zoom.

298
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,120
So are we getting pretty close to another fully supported

299
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,560
hardware device?

300
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,980
Both, yes.

301
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,120
I would say this is the question that

302
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,960
warned me about saying anything.

303
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:23,840
So the thing with hardware is it's extremely hard.

304
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,120
And we have to do some major changes

305
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,960
to be able to support Haulium, since we

306
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:36,600
are running many components that are non-standard in a way.

307
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:43,440
And we want to be closer to the Haulium or slash Mirror

308
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,760
in one way.

309
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,000
And that's quite some components to change out.

310
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,760
For example, the sensors and TPS.

311
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,400
And that's also why we say this is the starting point,

312
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,240
because now we can start doing all the cool things

313
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,120
with Haulium, with the inbox, and all these features

314
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,480
we want to implement, since we have a solid base to do it on

315
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,800
and a solid base to start working on top of.

316
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,200
So yeah, definitely more devices coming.

317
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,760
I have two devices side by me that I

318
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,840
have been porting nonstop after the OTA 4.

319
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,240
Oh, yeah?

320
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,040
Cool.

321
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,240
No tease on what they are, though.

322
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,280
You're just saying there's a couple there.

323
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,240
I can say one of them has the import out.

324
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,360
Oh, OK.

325
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,520
Well, I'm looking forward to seeing where this goes.

326
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,820
We'll have a link in the show notes

327
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,680
where you can get involved, get more information, all of that.

328
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,480
Just go to linuxunplug.com slash 264 to get over there,

329
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,920
or ubports.com to go directly to the project's website.

330
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,420
Well, thank you for joining us today.

331
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,400
You're welcome to stick around as we go on.

332
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,760
I wanted to cover this quick, just really just not really

333
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,640
totally worth covering, but super quick update.

334
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,680
Last week, we mentioned that Intel and Debian

335
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,100
were getting into it over a new license change that

336
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,000
was going to prevent benchmarks that used their microcode,

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,160
which would be all executions on your system.

338
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,680
And within about a few days after Linux Unplugged,

339
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,600
there was a change in their policy.

340
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,220
They removed that section and made it clear

341
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,560
that you can still benchmark, which we kind of speculated

342
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,080
would happen.

343
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,880
But I just wanted to kind of close the loop.

344
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,920
It's like so many things that we end up covering.

345
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,400
It seems like, you know, there's lots of drama up front.

346
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,240
And well, in the back room, the parties got it resolved.

347
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,480
And now there's a sane part of the license,

348
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,840
and it makes it much more clear.

349
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,340
Yeah.

350
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,960
By the time we're getting the news

351
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,720
and people are starting to get their pitchforks,

352
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,520
there's often already a response in the works.

353
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,680
It's so true.

354
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,880
Sometimes the hardest part of talking about something

355
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,680
is not talking about it at all.

356
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,720
How about a new feature?

357
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,920
I bet Poppy saw this that's landing in Kmail soon.

358
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,600
And it's very Gmail-esque, and I love it.

359
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,320
It's really cool.

360
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,360
It's called KDE Itinerary.

361
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,800
And it's a couple of components, including one part that's

362
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,440
called Prison, which is great.

363
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,480
It's the part that takes care of barcode reading and rendering.

364
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,920
And then there's also some support

365
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,880
in there mixed in there for Apple Wallet pass files.

366
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,520
I guess it turns out they're really nothing fancy.

367
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,520
They're just a zip archive containing JSON data

368
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,600
with some graphical assets for your logos.

369
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,360
Hey, that's easy.

370
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,520
No big deal, right?

371
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,320
So they're like, well, we can read that.

372
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,880
And they got that going.

373
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,040
And so there's this Kmail plug-in

374
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,120
that they've already got rendering, Apple Wallet pass

375
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,500
file attachments, and flight itineraries in Kmail.

376
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,600
So if you get an email confirming a flight,

377
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,160
you get this Google-like rendering in Kmail

378
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,640
now showing you your flight information.

379
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,720
And you can click on it and add it to your calendar.

380
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,680
Yeah, this is awesome.

381
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,720
This is totally awesome.

382
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,320
I heard about this at Academy.

383
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,880
You saw this?

384
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,760
Yeah, they were talking about it at Academy.

385
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,760
And the whole goal of this is to be

386
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,960
able to print out your boarding card

387
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,160
or have your boarding card on your phone or your laptop

388
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,720
or whatever without having some giant American company reading

389
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,000
all your email, basically.

390
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,240
You want to be able to be in control of your data.

391
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,720
And the whole ethos that runs through a lot of KDE apps

392
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,880
is privacy first, that user's privacy is respected.

393
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,620
And they don't send your data off to third parties,

394
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,520
but analyze your data locally.

395
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,880
And they've worked hard to analyze these emails

396
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,520
that you get from your travel partners or the data

397
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,240
that you get from a travel booking

398
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,460
to be able to render your ticket or your boarding card

399
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,400
or whatever.

400
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,040
And it's hard.

401
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,740
It's a hard problem to solve because most

402
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,080
of these other companies have solved it all on the server

403
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,560
and they don't make anyone aware of what

404
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
the format of this data is.

405
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,200
So the KDE teams have worked hard.

406
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,640
I say teams because a lot of people

407
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,080
are involved in this in order to make it possible for you

408
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,240
to board a plane using free software.

409
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,960
Yeah, they're even working on a mobile end of it

410
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,920
where you can pull it up on your mobile device

411
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,560
and render it out so that way you

412
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,280
don't have to hold K-mail up to the boarding scanner, which

413
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,960
I really appreciate that.

414
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,000
It does look really neat.

415
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,920
And that concept you touched on there, they looked at this

416
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,880
and said, well, right now this can

417
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,360
be done by a few large US corporations.

418
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Wouldn't it be great if we could do this locally

419
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,280
on your machine?

420
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,840
I would love to see more of that, more of that.

421
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,800
And it's one of those things where right now you

422
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,480
have to rely on big corporations probably using

423
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,160
a whole bunch of your data and big complicated machine

424
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,380
learning models to try to parse this and make it nice.

425
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,200
It felt very far away from anything open source.

426
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,920
So to have something that seems so close to being workable

427
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,600
right now, I'm impressed.

428
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,840
Yeah, I'm curious.

429
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,520
Wimpy, are you still a MailSpring user?

430
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,400
Is this still what you're using for mail?

431
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,680
Have you had issues with MailSpring on high DPI?

432
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,480
I do use MailSpring.

433
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,720
I use it predominantly for my home email,

434
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,000
and I use it occasionally for my work email.

435
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,920
And that's mostly because I use Wavebox for work,

436
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,280
which sort of consolidates calendars and email and Slack

437
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,560
and various other online collaboration tools

438
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,120
all in one place.

439
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,260
So when I'm working, I tend to use Wavebox.

440
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,360
But I do love MailSpring.

441
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,520
As soon as MailSpring grows deep calendar integration,

442
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,900
then I'll be in there all day, every day.

443
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,920
Yeah, I'm finding that I am hitting

444
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,800
the edges of it in calendar regards

445
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,120
and also in just the UI just keeps falling over on.

446
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,040
I can't run it maximized on high DPI

447
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,440
or else it won't render portions of the UI for me.

448
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,040
So I'm not super thrilled with the state of native email

449
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,440
clients on Linux.

450
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,960
So I might look at this Wavebox, take a look at that.

451
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,720
I assume it's like some sort of service.

452
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,200
No, Wavebox is a wrapper for many.

453
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,160
It used to be called WMail back in the day and has evolved.

454
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,120
And it supports things like Gmail,

455
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,920
well, in fact, the Google Suite.

456
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,400
So when you had a Google account, it adds things

457
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,600
like the calendar and Hangouts and Google+,

458
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,760
and a whole bunch of different services

459
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,480
under a collapsible menu.

460
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,400
But it also supports things like different Slack accounts

461
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,000
and Twitter and just a whole raft of stuff.

462
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,680
And it's just a really elegant way.

463
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,320
It's basically like Pidgin for the 21st century.

464
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,600
Yeah, that's interesting.

465
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,120
You're right.

466
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,500
It's like it's a multi-service central.

467
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,840
And I didn't used to have an appetite for that kind of thing.

468
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,440
But now I do see the use case for it.

469
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,160
And as luck, just sheer luck would have it,

470
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,000
Wavebox is available as a snap.

471
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,040
Who would have guessed?

472
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Who would have guessed it?

473
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,720
It's not like the developer was an early adopter

474
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,440
and has been behind the platform since the very beginning

475
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,160
or anything.

476
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,080
There you go.

477
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,080
So Chris, I'm going to let you into a little secret.

478
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,240
Sometimes I struggle with my grammar and use

479
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,480
of the right words in written English.

480
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,040
No.

481
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,920
Yeah, it's true.

482
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,320
And one of the facilities of Wavebox

483
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:08,080
is it has sort of whitelisted a selection of Google Chrome

484
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,440
extensions within Wavebox, one of which is Grammarly.

485
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,520
So I now have Grammarly enabled.

486
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,680
And I now have Grammarly persistent across all

487
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,760
of the sessions that I manage in Wavebox

488
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,840
through my single Grammarly instance.

489
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,360
And it has reduced typos and screw ups in the written words

490
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,360
significantly.

491
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,000
So yeah, it's pretty fantastic.

492
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,680
Wavebox is very elegantly.

493
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,000
And it's not like every extension imaginable.

494
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,040
It's just like the really useful stuff

495
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,520
that optimizes your workflows.

496
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,600
And then for an extension like that,

497
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,680
I don't necessarily have to have it in the main browser.

498
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,120
And I could just keep it in Wavebox.

499
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,840
Exactly so.

500
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,600
I'll be checking that out.

501
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,240
Now, there was an article that ran over at linuxjournal.com

502
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,320
by Sarim.

503
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,400
And it was on the 24th of the last week.

504
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,640
And Sarim wrote in here that the year of the Linux desktop

505
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,360
has been a constant call to arms that's

506
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,000
sunken into a joke way past its expiration date.

507
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,120
That's a good line, Sarim.

508
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,920
That's a good line right there.

509
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,680
And so he goes on to make a pretty compelling case.

510
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,040
He says, today, what we have is a distribution-centric model.

511
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,320
Software is distributed by an OSV, which

512
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,840
is an operating system vendor.

513
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,760
And users get their software directly

514
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,440
from there via whatever packaging mechanism

515
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,040
that OSV supports.

516
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,920
This model has evolved because in the early to mid-1990s,

517
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,240
those OSVs extended to existed, I should say,

518
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,840
to compile the kernel and user space into a cohesive product.

519
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,080
He's essentially setting up the role of what the distro package

520
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,440
maintainers had done.

521
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,600
Packaging of applications was the next step

522
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,120
as a convenience factor to save users

523
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,080
from having to compile their own applications.

524
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,400
Yep, I'd say that's pretty much the case.

525
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,440
Ultimately, though, these operating system vendors,

526
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,400
or OSVs, enjoyed being gatekeepers

527
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,480
as part of keeping developers honest and fixing

528
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,680
issues that were unique to their operating system.

529
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,480
OSVs saw themselves as agents representing users

530
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,520
to provide high-quality software.

531
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,360
And there was a feeling that developers

532
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,040
were not to be trusted, as, of course,

533
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
nobody knows the state of their operating system

534
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,080
better than they would.

535
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,760
However, this model represented a number of challenges

536
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,080
to both commercial and open source developers.

537
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,840
For commercial developers, the problem

538
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,840
became how to maximize their audience

539
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,240
as the Linux market consisted of a number of major OSVs

540
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,720
and an uncountable number of smaller niche distributions.

541
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,040
Commercial application developers

542
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,720
would have to develop multiple versions

543
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,840
of their own application targeted

544
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,440
at various distributions for fear of missing out

545
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,960
on a subset of users.

546
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,080
Over time, commercial application developers

547
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,560
would settle on using Ubuntu or a compressed tar

548
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,800
file hosted on their website.

549
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,000
Now, he goes on to keep making the case here.

550
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,600
And I'll leave it as an exercise to you

551
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,880
to read the whole article.

552
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,480
But he makes the case that the distrocentric model also

553
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,840
makes it difficult for developers

554
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,040
to have relationships with their users.

555
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,480
There is no way to build a community around an application

556
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,880
if users are getting their software from the distribution

557
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,000
without any thought.

558
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,480
He writes, this model, I believe,

559
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,400
has reached its end of usefulness.

560
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,040
In order to further scale the market for Linux applications,

561
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,000
we need to move to a new model.

562
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,120
Although we can never eliminate the distribution-centric model,

563
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,880
nor should we, to reach scalability,

564
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,640
we need to remove the OSV as the gatekeeper for application

565
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
distribution and allow developers

566
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,920
to control how they distribute their applications.

567
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,360
This is a new iteration on a couple of conversations

568
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,200
we've had semi-recently, Wes.

569
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,400
Yeah, I mean, it absolutely is, right?

570
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,160
This has been a continued trend.

571
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,760
We've been driven to alternative OSVs,

572
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,520
even by the facet of we just need the software we need,

573
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,840
especially when you're, you know,

574
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,400
it's one thing if you just want to have a free open source

575
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,280
desktop that you use casually to check some emails.

576
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,040
But once you're doing real work, you

577
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,840
have a much closer relationship with the people

578
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,240
providing the software that lets you do that work.

579
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,360
And you don't need a bunch of middlemen in the way.

580
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,840
And that's been a big problem.

581
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,320
So it's interesting to see it being addressed in so many

582
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:09,960
ways.

583
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,560
Yeah, yeah, it is.

584
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,800
Sometimes for business software, it's

585
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,120
a one-to-one relationship.

586
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,840
The vendor specifically creates software for the business,

587
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,200
and you're getting it from them.

588
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,680
You know, there's no distribution

589
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,120
required to be in the middle.

590
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,600
And so those typically just be distributed as tar files

591
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,620
or something like that.

592
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,960
And then as we've watched the growth of snaps and flat packs,

593
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,680
the conversation has become more and more often, hey,

594
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,840
we're watching a shift here.

595
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,320
I think something we brought up just recently

596
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,440
is these things, like self-updating flat packs

597
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,200
and self-updating snaps, what that represents

598
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,360
is software developers pushing new software

599
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,400
to a store or a repo, which then gets pushed down

600
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,880
to your machine.

601
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
And that's not how it used to work.

602
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,960
It used to work that a Debian maintainer would review a

603
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,400
package and then submit it to the repo.

604
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,280
And then when there was a new version of Debian

605
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,080
that would get cut, the new versions of packages

606
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,640
would get cut.

607
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,240
Like, it was a way different process just even

608
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,720
a couple of years ago.

609
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,200
And there has been this huge shift

610
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,880
with app images and all these other universal installers

611
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,080
that we have just kind of sat back and watched and commented

612
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,360
on now a little bit more.

613
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,440
And I think that's in that context.

614
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,160
That's why I'm pretty curious to see how,

615
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,760
which I think is the first, Libre Application Summit goes.

616
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,000
It's happening next week in Denver, September 6

617
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,040
through the 9th.

618
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,320
And it's hosted by Gnome.

619
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,200
And it bills itself as an application summit

620
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,880
that brings together application writers, distributions,

621
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,880
toolkits, and OS plumbers to build an ecosystem that

622
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,680
encourages building applications on free software operating

623
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,520
systems.

624
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,880
One of the nice things about the Libre Application Summit

625
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,600
is Gnome has reached out to XSE.

626
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,240
I think they tried to reach out to Solace.

627
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,760
And there's going to be a bunch of folks from Plasma

628
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,920
that are going to be there.

629
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,200
So it's not just about GDK.

630
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,680
It's not just about the Gnome desktop.

631
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:03,600
But it's being grown to reach out to the community at large.

632
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,680
Did they contact anyone from the Electron community?

633
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,080
I was on a conference call today.

634
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,720
And they're reaching out to a few folks from there as well.

635
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,240
Oh, good.

636
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,360
Fantastic.

637
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,960
If they need help with that, can you connect us?

638
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,680
Because I can help with that.

639
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,200
Sure.

640
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,440
Shoot me a telegram, and I'll get you connected.

641
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,120
Right, will do.

642
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,280
Because obviously, Electron on Linux sits on top of GDK,

643
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,760
well, two or three, depending on which version of Electron

644
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,600
you use.

645
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,320
So there's obviously some overlap there.

646
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,520
Might be a bit late in the day, but let's have a go.

647
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,440
All right, so Poby, Wimpy, Wes, you and I,

648
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,480
we've all been to plenty of conferences.

649
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,840
What do you think of this one, about a conference?

650
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,200
And I think we're familiar with the background and all that,

651
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,080
like a conference to kind of get together and encourage

652
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,440
application development on Linux.

653
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,600
Where do we start with this?

654
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,800
I'm curious to know your thoughts, Poby,

655
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,960
because I think you and I learned about it

656
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,040
at the same time on Twitter.

657
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,080
Yeah.

658
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,560
So I would love to have gone, actually.

659
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,560
I really wanted to represent us, but it's

660
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,480
a terrible weekend for people in the UK,

661
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,440
because that's when kids start back at school.

662
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,320
Plus, there's been a whole lot of other events.

663
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,600
So I was actually super keen to go along,

664
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,760
but it's in the wrong continent at the wrong time.

665
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,000
I find it interesting that there's

666
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,840
an event that talks about applications on Linux.

667
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm interested to know who the target audience for this is,

668
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,840
whether it's the KDE people, the GTK people, the Electron

669
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,320
people, and Qt and everyone else,

670
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,160
and who they're going to be talking to.

671
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,920
Are they going to be talking to each other and saying,

672
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,360
yeah, we should get all this done,

673
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,960
and what are the outcomes of this going to be?

674
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,160
Or are they trying to pitch this to new developers,

675
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,000
like students who are entering the market

676
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,280
and just starting to develop?

677
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,920
I'm keen to understand who that target is.

678
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,880
And for me, it isn't completely clear who

679
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,160
the target for this event is.

680
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,280
Well, I think that's something that's growing.

681
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,480
I think this is the third year or so

682
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,080
of this particular conference.

683
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,440
There is a couple of talks on making projects

684
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,880
interesting for students.

685
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,280
There's some talks being put on by KDE about how they do things.

686
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,280
There's talks being put on by GNOME about how they do things.

687
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,240
And someone I left out was Elementary OS.

688
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,320
They've got a couple of folks that are coming.

689
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,440
So I think the target audience is application developers

690
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,560
as a whole, be it new developers, old developers.

691
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,880
I think it's trying to set a precedent for development

692
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,680
of applications moving forward.

693
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,000
I would have loved to attended this event, and also Guadec

694
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,280
as well, representing the Marte desktop.

695
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,080
But as Alan has just explained, the timing

696
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,400
doesn't work for me.

697
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,320
And maybe next year, I'll be able to get involved.

698
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,800
If there's anyone who is listening

699
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,880
from the organizing committee, or who is going to be there,

700
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,680
one of the things I learned recently

701
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,840
was when I was at the Electron Maintainers Summit,

702
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,760
an Electron being dependent on GTK2 traditionally,

703
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,480
and more so GTK3 in the recent versions of Electron,

704
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,840
they were shocked to learn at the ABI breakage that

705
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:24,400
existed through GTK in recent years,

706
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,760
and the fact that they had deliberately

707
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,200
built against old versions of GTK,

708
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,920
thinking they were going to bake in some kind of legacy

709
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,240
forward compatibility, and then horrified

710
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,160
to learn that it segfaults like a bastard,

711
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,800
and it's a big fat mess.

712
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,760
And we need to think beyond what are

713
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:51,280
the traditional Linux application developers now.

714
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,360
You can think what you like about Electron,

715
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,760
and you can be wrong about that, and that's fine.

716
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,280
But the majority of development that

717
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,000
happens on the Linux desktop right now that

718
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,360
is relevant to the world that we live in

719
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,000
happens in the Electron sphere, and we

720
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,400
need to invite those people into our world

721
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,520
and educate them to the nuances of the way that we do things,

722
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,680
and the peculiarities of our toolkits,

723
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,520
and also seek their feedback on how

724
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,680
we are going to accommodate enterprise class application

725
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,960
developers on our platform.

726
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,320
I also was really hoping to make it this year.

727
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,880
It's a long shot for me because I will

728
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,360
be traveling during that time, but I

729
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,040
will be traveling home because I want to see the kids for school.

730
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,960
So I'm really torn because it seems like an event

731
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,520
that I really support, and that's

732
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,840
why I want to give them some time here on the show

733
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,840
to talk about it a little bit because I

734
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,960
think the idea is good.

735
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,520
How do we get different projects together all

736
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,200
with the same goal of making Linux a better platform

737
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,680
to develop applications for?

738
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,000
Build a network of people that are interested in that

739
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,240
and can provide support and fast feedback,

740
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,600
and I'm excited to see what the second version of this

741
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,680
looks like, if this can get off the ground,

742
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,120
roll in really well.

743
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,360
I'm sure the next one will be even better, more people,

744
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,360
and probably we can tell a little bit more about what

745
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,600
it's all going to be about.

746
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,560
So Eric, the IT guy, if you end up getting to go,

747
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,120
you'll be our reporter on the ground.

748
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,840
You can report back and let us know, OK?

749
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,160
I will definitely be there, and I'm checking up

750
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,320
with one of the folks from System76

751
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,920
offered me a place to sleep, which

752
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,320
made it financially affordable.

753
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,120
So I'll be making the drive next Wednesday morning.

754
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,960
Oh, doing a road trip style.

755
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,040
Good, good.

756
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,320
That's how I like to do it too.

757
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,680
I like to do it that way.

758
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,600
All right, guys.

759
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,400
Well, I think it's going to be a good show.

760
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,440
I don't think I'm going to make it, but if you do make it

761
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,880
and you want to join us too and share your experiences like

762
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,840
Eric will, you are welcome to.

763
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,440
We do this show live on Tuesdays.

764
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,040
You can go to jblive.tv.

765
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,200
Usually starts around 2 PM Pacific,

766
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,440
but it's all converted at jupiterbroadcasting.com

767
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,480
slash calendar to your local time.

768
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,960
And you don't even have to hang out in the mobile.

769
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,960
You can just come watch the show if you want.

770
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,640
In fact, I would encourage you to join us next week

771
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,920
because we have a really great show planned for next week

772
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,680
with some special guests, and I think it'll be a good one.

773
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,400
So join us live next week, jblive.tv on Tuesday.

774
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,120
And if you make it to the Libre application summit,

775
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,880
first of all, tell them to choose a different name

776
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,920
than the last, and then let us know how it went.

777
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,160
Now let's take a moment and thank a few of our sponsors.

778
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,640
I want to get, after the sponsor block here,

779
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,760
I want to get into Proton.

780
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,920
I want to get into Steam Play, and I just want to leave

781
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,960
as much room for it as we want.

782
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,800
If it's a five-minute conversation,

783
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,920
if it's a 55-minute conversation.

784
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,320
I think there's a lot to get into.

785
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,200
We've dug into some of the technicals here,

786
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,400
done some testing, quote unquote, for you, you know,

787
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,880
the hard work, but also I've been talking to people

788
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,200
in the audience that, for some, it's the end of the world,

789
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,200
and for some, it means they can now fundamentally

790
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,040
switch to Linux, and I've gotten a couple of stories

791
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,120
that have gotten me kind of hyped

792
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,240
because I am at a point right now

793
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,120
where Windows applications are just not a thing

794
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,240
I need anymore.

795
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,080
I'm not, you know, I'm not trying to be high and mighty.

796
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,240
It's just I've spent years sort of systematically

797
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,280
avoiding Windows, and so I really haven't built up

798
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,520
a demand of applications that I need,

799
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,360
and that even extends to games.

800
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,560
If the game wasn't available for Linux, that's fine.

801
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,160
I've got plenty of games to play.

802
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,880
So it took me a little bit to get my head around

803
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,600
why I should care about this.

804
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,000
I mean, obviously I care because it's a lot of cool stuff

805
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,520
happening for people that like to use Linux.

806
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,240
That makes me care, but why should I personally

807
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,920
get excited about this?

808
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,680
And when I started hearing some people's stories

809
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,520
and I started digging into what's happening here,

810
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,840
I got excited, and I'm gonna share with you

811
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,400
what I've learned, including I contacted the folks

812
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,480
at CodeWeavers, and I got some official statements

813
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,920
from them on what their involvement with all of this was.

814
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,200
So we can clear up all of that.

815
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,640
So let's start by thanking Ting.

816
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,160
You can start by going to linux.ting.com.

817
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,480
That's how you support the show and get $25 off a device,

818
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,240
or if you bring a device, $25 in service credit.

819
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,400
Your average Ting bill is just 23 bucks,

820
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,760
so that $25 will pay for more than your first month.

821
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,960
It really makes a difference,

822
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,960
and that's because it's smarter than unlimited.

823
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,240
You just pay for what you use.

824
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,360
However much you talk, text, and data you use,

825
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,280
that's what you pay.

826
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,920
If you're visiting the state sometime, grab a Ting line.

827
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,600
You can get a SIM card, pop it in a device

828
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,560
that's compatible, check their BYOD page.

829
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,280
They have CDMA and GSM, which means you've got

830
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,480
a lot of options to choose from.

831
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,440
There's no contract, so when you're ready to go

832
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,120
after you've been visiting, you could disable it if you want.

833
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,000
You could also just keep it.

834
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,880
It's $6 a month for the line.

835
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,800
I mean, it's $6 plus whatever Uncle Sam's gonna cut.

836
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,200
And then your usage.

837
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,320
So if you wanna just keep a Ting line, you can.

838
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,760
It's pretty economical.

839
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,480
They have a great control panel that lets you manage

840
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,920
all of this and set up alerts and usage stuff,

841
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,240
and also great customer service

842
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,800
that's always ready to help you out.

843
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,400
Devices you can buy directly or bring one.

844
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,920
They have a great BYOD page,

845
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,000
and the entire activation process can be done

846
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,840
through their website.

847
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,000
If you wanna do it at 1 a.m. while you just have

848
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,160
a wild hair and you just don't feel like talking

849
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,000
to another human being,

850
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,760
well, that's how I activated my EVO, and it worked.

851
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,000
I couldn't believe it.

852
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I assumed I'd have to call.

853
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I activated my EVO 4G Y Max edition over four years ago,

854
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,720
popped that sucker in, and I got $25 in service credit.

855
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,320
And when it paid for more than my first month,

856
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,280
I've never, ever gone back.

857
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,480
Canceled Verizon, moved my other phones over.

858
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,320
It was great.

859
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,960
I went from paying 120 before taxes,

860
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,240
so it was more like 145 per month,

861
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,160
to sometimes like maybe 45.

862
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,040
It's just, it was a huge shift, huge shift.

863
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,040
And I just, I'll never forget that experience,

864
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,160
and you can try it out too

865
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,680
by starting going to linux.ting.com.

866
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,240
Now, DigitalOcean.

867
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,480
Now, if you wanna make big podcasts,

868
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,720
you wanna make big projects,

869
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,480
you wanna look like you got a big data center,

870
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,760
I don't know where I'm going with that really,

871
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,280
other than to tell you DigitalOcean's how you do it.

872
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,040
Do.co slash unplugged.

873
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,880
I say that because within 55 seconds,

874
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,000
you can have something on their enterprise grade SSL

875
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,720
these 40 gigabit connections coming into their hypervisors,

876
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,640
data centers all over the world.

877
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,960
Like it's a legitimate setup and you have access to it

878
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,880
and you can get it for a hundred dollars of credit

879
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,600
and just try it out for like 60 days.

880
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,040
And it's yours to like have as a data center infrastructure.

881
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,360
You wrap your head around that concept.

882
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,720
You can just go deploy systems when you want them now.

883
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,840
And it's great.

884
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,360
It's nothing like it used to be.

885
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,920
You know, when I'd have to get a system set up,

886
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,360
it would be a two week lead time

887
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,080
before the vendor would even ship the parts.

888
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,560
And then you got to put it in the rack

889
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,680
and then you got to pay for power.

890
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,320
You got to pay for internet and you know,

891
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,560
T1 lines like a thousand bucks a month.

892
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,400
And now for three cents an hour,

893
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,520
I can have four gigs of RAM, two CPUs,

894
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,840
80 gigabytes of enterprise grade SSD,

895
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,600
three terabytes worth of transfer

896
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,560
and a dashboard that is an industry leading dashboard.

897
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,160
Like nobody does it like this.

898
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
They set the bar.

899
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,120
They're trusted by over a million developers

900
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,120
and the pricing is straightforward and predictable.

901
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,520
And when you go to do.co slash unplugged,

902
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,080
you get a $100 credit.

903
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,480
When you sign up with a new account,

904
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,080
you can try them out, see what I've been talking about.

905
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,240
Maybe go get off Dropbox and move over to Nextcloud.

906
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,160
I'm just saying, you know,

907
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,200
they've got some good infrastructure for that.

908
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,600
I've been running the Nextcloud instance up there

909
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,720
for about two years as like a hot test,

910
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,200
you know, like a hot standby.

911
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,040
It's great.

912
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,880
It's great.

913
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,240
I've recently attached 25 gigs worth of additional storage.

914
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,080
Love it.

915
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,560
It's just perfect.

916
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,280
So go check it out, do.co slash unplugged and get started.

917
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,560
And then last but absolutely not least,

918
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,000
a big thank you to Linux Academy.

919
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,120
I would tell you to go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged,

920
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,440
but I'm actually say don't do that.

921
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,080
I mean, do it, but don't do it until September 3rd

922
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,680
because they're doing a huge sale.

923
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,680
You can buy out the whole year for 299.

924
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,600
Just be done for the year.

925
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,560
299, you get access to everything.

926
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,600
And that's a great deal.

927
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,560
That's like phenomenal pricing.

928
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,560
And the value you get from that is mind blowing.

929
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,800
That is an, the books alone back in the day

930
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,640
to take those courses would have been four or $500.

931
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,800
Like I can't even with you right now with this.

932
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,800
So go to Linux Academy, but wait until September 3rd

933
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,160
because on September 3rd, Monday,

934
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,960
they're starting a 299 a year sale.

935
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,440
And I think that's the best deal that they've been doing ads

936
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,600
on this network since 2014.

937
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,040
And I think that's the best deal that we have ever seen.

938
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,920
So go to Linux Academy, but just wait a couple of days

939
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,200
and then sign up.

940
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,080
It's a platform to learn about Linux,

941
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,600
everything that Linux runs or runs on Linux,

942
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,280
including the things that are really gonna make

943
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,400
your resume look good.

944
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,120
And it's stuff that's put together

945
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:45,680
by full-time training architects who specialize in this stuff.

946
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,120
Like they're from the field.

947
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,920
And they're creating the courseware

948
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,240
and they're answering your questions.

949
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,080
And now they're doing a sale

950
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,800
that is way beyond anything I've ever seen.

951
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,840
So go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged on Monday

952
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,280
and September 3rd, 2018, and look for that 299 a year sale.

953
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,960
Dig around until you get it.

954
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,920
That's the best tip I've had

955
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,080
for Linux Academy for a long time.

956
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,640
Plus they just launched all that new content.

957
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,040
It's all in there, all the new, the labs,

958
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,120
the interactive guides, like it's all in there.

959
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,360
So it's a great deal, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

960
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,000
And a big thank you to Linux Academy

961
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,720
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

962
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,280
Thanks to all of our sponsors

963
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,640
for sponsoring this here show.

964
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,040
Okay, so there we go.

965
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,880
Sponsor block is done.

966
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,440
We've done our business for the day.

967
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,240
Now we get to just play around.

968
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,720
So let's talk about Steam Play.

969
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,800
We can have fun.

970
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,840
Oh, I was having fun.

971
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,200
Let me tell you, I was having fun.

972
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,640
But now, now this is a whole new kind of fun.

973
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,000
This is like an emulated fun.

974
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,880
But don't call it an emulator.

975
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,480
All right, so let's talk about Steam Play,

976
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,920
which we were speculating about on Linux Action News.

977
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,920
And then it came out and boom, here we have it.

978
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,240
And the core of Steam Play is really something called Proton.

979
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,320
That's what's sitting underneath the Steam client

980
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,480
is this Proton system.

981
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,600
And I don't know, Wes, I'd say it's probably fair

982
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,720
to describe Proton as something that's made up of many parts.

983
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,960
Well, yeah, I think you're absolutely right about that.

984
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,080
And there's lots of little bits keeping those parts together

985
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,080
in a way that you, the happy, steamed end user,

986
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,840
hopefully doesn't have to care about.

987
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,520
Yeah, there's like the way they've built this thing,

988
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,720
they being the people that have contributed to it,

989
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,640
is like there's different shims in there

990
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,760
for different types of Windows gaming technology.

991
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,600
So there might be a shim in there specifically

992
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,040
for DirectX 12, which is much more Vulkan-like at lower

993
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,000
levels and requires less translation.

994
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And there's also shims in there for older versions

995
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
of DirectX, right?

996
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,600
Yeah, there's older ones, DirectX 9, DirectX 11, of course.

997
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,760
Plus, they've had to do some other work just

998
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,200
to make things play nice, like better full screen support,

999
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,040
game set support.

1000
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,480
And of course, they have their own things

1001
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,920
to integrate, like better things for Steamworks,

1002
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,000
targeting native APIs, better open VR support.

1003
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,680
There's just a lot in this one title.

1004
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,080
So Valve has posted Proton up on GitHub.

1005
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,480
And when you look through some of the issues that

1006
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,080
have been closed, there is a comment in there

1007
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,080
who's a collaborator on the project who's

1008
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,440
a CodeWeavers employee.

1009
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,720
And I believe his name is Eric.

1010
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,360
And he writes, we've been working on Proton

1011
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,320
for a long time.

1012
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,880
We've needed an internal code name for it.

1013
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,600
And we couldn't really tip our hat if it leaked.

1014
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,800
So we had to decide how the heck are we going to name Proton?

1015
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,960
What do we refer to it as?

1016
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,040
He says, we didn't want it to be something

1017
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,840
that we'd be embarrassed after using it after release.

1018
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,080
So no badger, badger, badger.

1019
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,840
And a bunch of ideas that were kicked around the CodeWeavers

1020
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,200
office one afternoon.

1021
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,440
And it ended up we picked Proton because it's

1022
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,240
short, easy to remember, sounds cool,

1023
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,760
and it's hard to Google for.

1024
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,240
So I was like, interesting.

1025
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,200
What did CodeWeavers have to do with this?

1026
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,440
Because I've heard about Valve.

1027
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,320
I've heard about Valve financing developers.

1028
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,320
I've heard about Valve's investment in Linux gaming.

1029
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,520
I've heard about SteamOS.

1030
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,920
But what did CodeWeavers have to do with this?

1031
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,080
CodeWeavers are the folks that make crossover office

1032
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,000
for Linux and Mac that lets you run lots of applications.

1033
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,480
Including games.

1034
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,040
And Jeremy White, their CEO, blogged

1035
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,560
the day of the announcement that they've

1036
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:15,080
been working directly with Valve for two years on this effort.

1037
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,760
And that got my interest, but it wasn't good enough.

1038
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,080
I said to myself, that doesn't make any sense.

1039
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,240
Because Valve is technically a competitor in some ways.

1040
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,160
Like this makes there be less demand for crossover office.

1041
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,880
Because a huge part of it is making Windows games work

1042
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,440
that don't normally work very easily.

1043
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,400
They don't normally work very easily under Wine.

1044
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,880
So I emailed crossover and I said, guys,

1045
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,120
could you clear this up for me?

1046
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,560
Because it sounds like from what I'm reading,

1047
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,640
I'm getting vague implications that CodeWeavers was fairly

1048
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,080
involved with Proton.

1049
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,480
And it's true.

1050
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,120
I asked, did you have dedicated staff to work on Proton?

1051
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,840
And they write, yes, we did have dedicated staff.

1052
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,440
Was a large portion of the code to Proton

1053
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,120
contributed by CodeWeavers?

1054
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,120
And they say that we contributed to Wine for this project

1055
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:05,040
and we contributed a great deal of the Proton glue code.

1056
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,080
There's a lot of other folks who contributed as well.

1057
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,080
And we've been amazed by the amount of energy

1058
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,920
that Valve continues to bring into this.

1059
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,080
I asked if this was actually started in-house at CodeWeavers.

1060
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,800
And the answer I got there was, we

1061
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,280
have worked with Valve on this from the beginning.

1062
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,920
In other words, to me, that sounds like Valve contacted

1063
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,880
them and said, here's something we want to do.

1064
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,800
And we think you're the folks to hire to do it.

1065
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,600
Because that is something that CodeWeavers

1066
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,360
has done before for other folks.

1067
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,000
We have worked with Valve on this from the beginning.

1068
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,920
To me, sounds like someone from Valve

1069
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,080
reached out to them from the very, very beginning

1070
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,720
of the project and said, we want to make changes to Wine.

1071
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,600
And we want to work with you to do it.

1072
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,360
I asked if it was always intended to be used by Valve

1073
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,520
or if they started it as an internal project to use it.

1074
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,480
And they say their sole intention

1075
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,200
was working with Valve to create this for them.

1076
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,000
The last follow-up question that I asked

1077
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,400
was if we would see some of these improvements

1078
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,920
make it into upstream Wine and Crossover Office.

1079
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,120
And they said, yes, absolutely.

1080
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,200
The Crossover Linux product will contain

1081
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,720
all of the Wine goodness that we have contributed upstream.

1082
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,600
The Proton bits aren't really necessary for that,

1083
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,280
as generally, our product already

1084
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,920
has all of the Glue bits that we already

1085
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,920
need, like picking the different DirectX levels

1086
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,520
and setting up the Wine bottles.

1087
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,320
But they are exploring using DXVK.

1088
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,520
But it gets tricky, as they also consider

1089
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,800
the macOS a part of their customer base.

1090
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,040
And it's a different set of applications requirements.

1091
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,800
But it does sound like CodeWeavers,

1092
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,000
from the very, very beginning of this effort,

1093
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,400
was involved and was working with Valve to build this thing

1094
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,000
and then contribute those improvements upstream to Wine.

1095
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,460
I mean, that kind of makes sense.

1096
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,760
We'd seen some movement on the Direct3D12 implementation,

1097
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,080
VKD3D.

1098
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,880
I think a lot of people have been kind of like, well,

1099
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,880
where's this coming from?

1100
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,880
Who's funding this?

1101
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,280
Why is this a Wine project?

1102
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,680
I mean, it made sense that it would fall under that umbrella.

1103
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,520
But that's a big undertaking to come out of nowhere.

1104
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,640
So I'm sure, knowing that they had the support

1105
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,520
that this bigger, hidden undertaking was happening,

1106
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,920
that's a lot of confidence, a lot of runway

1107
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,120
to build something that takes a long time to get a usable

1108
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,040
product.

1109
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,400
I feel like they valved up the announcement a little bit.

1110
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,860
Sort of a typical thing, it's a pretty solid announcement.

1111
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,600
But they managed to do something small that just really

1112
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,800
sets the impression.

1113
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:32,080
And they had this initial list of like 15 supported games.

1114
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:36,120
And two or three, four of them are like modern, this year

1115
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,240
games.

1116
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,040
And the rest are all like old games that nobody cares about,

1117
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,000
that nobody is trying to run on Linux.

1118
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,120
Stuff that came out years ago, years ago.

1119
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,760
And it just reinforces this impression

1120
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,080
that you can't get all these games on Linux.

1121
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:57,320
It was this really odd list of games that I felt like

1122
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,180
was actually more harmful than good.

1123
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:02,040
Because when you look at the actual list

1124
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,720
that the community is maintaining of games that work,

1125
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,840
it's astronomically large.

1126
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,380
I'll have some links in the show notes.

1127
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,880
It is huge.

1128
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,080
There are so many well-supported games.

1129
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,800
And I'll tell you, when it clicked for me

1130
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,600
was when I realized I could play Age of Empires 2 again.

1131
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,020
That is, I swear to God, Microsoft is never

1132
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,400
going to release that game.

1133
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,160
They'll never update Age of Empires 2 or 3 for Linux.

1134
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,720
I'm just SOL.

1135
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,880
But now with this and the community list

1136
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,200
where they tell you what tweaks to make,

1137
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,240
I can play those old games again.

1138
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,340
And it's pretty exciting.

1139
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:39,280
It represents a significant shift of availability again.

1140
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,360
Now, it's not a perfect solution.

1141
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,640
Not everything works.

1142
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,560
And sometimes you've got to implement some workarounds.

1143
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,600
But we just probably got another 1,000 games

1144
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,560
that work on Linux.

1145
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,400
And some of them are AAA titles.

1146
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,480
So with that all said, I feel like I

1147
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,140
must defer to the elite gamer of the group, Mr. Martin Wimpress,

1148
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,280
and get your impressions on this news.

1149
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,360
Well, it's humbling to know that you recognize

1150
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,200
my status in this discussion.

1151
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,680
Yeah, we talk about this on a recent Ubuntu podcast.

1152
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:17,440
And my take is that I've never, until Steam came to Linux,

1153
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,760
I was never a gamer on Linux.

1154
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,960
I used consoles as the means by which to consume games.

1155
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,800
And as soon as Steam arrived for Linux,

1156
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,840
then I was able to game on a platform

1157
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,880
that I really believed in.

1158
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:38,480
And this just extends the corpus of gaming catalog

1159
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,720
that I have access to now.

1160
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,880
And in particular, there's a particular genre of games

1161
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,960
that I enjoy most, which is racing games.

1162
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,080
And I've installed dozens, in fact,

1163
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:56,120
purchased and installed dozens of these Windows titles

1164
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:02,440
on the new Steam client beta, and had a wonderful time

1165
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,400
revisiting some classic racing games

1166
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,320
that I've not played for years, and also some new games

1167
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,120
that I really wanted to play but didn't have access to.

1168
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,800
And I'm now able to.

1169
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,320
And I'm sure there are going to be rough edges along the way.

1170
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,920
But I think this is a net positive for us.

1171
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,400
If you make publishers' lives easy,

1172
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,200
that they can see the number of people that

1173
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,560
are playing their published titles on Linux

1174
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,320
and not experiencing issues outside of what they know

1175
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,980
to be the bugs that exist in their existing Windows

1176
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,720
platform compatibility, then they're

1177
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:50,280
going to get behind this because it's an almost zero effort

1178
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,020
activity.

1179
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:55,880
So yeah, I realize that some people will see Proton

1180
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,560
as the electron for gaming on Linux,

1181
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,600
and it will be the demon seed, and it

1182
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,600
will be berated and chastised in all the usual corners

1183
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,920
of the internet that those opinions are expressed.

1184
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,120
But for me, this is a positive step forward,

1185
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,240
and I'll be really interested to see

1186
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,680
how it develops over the next six to nine months

1187
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,800
and what other pieces of the Valve jigsaw puzzle

1188
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,480
fall into place behind it.

1189
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,880
Yeah, this is one of the more interesting pieces.

1190
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,680
This is the central piece, right?

1191
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,960
This is the pivotal piece to whatever Valve's strategy may

1192
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:36,520
have been at the outset and the various faltering starts.

1193
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:40,200
I think this could be the piece that really propels things

1194
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:40,900
forward.

1195
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,640
And it sounds like we get a timeline.

1196
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,720
CodeWeavers gives us a two-year timeline.

1197
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,560
Yeah.

1198
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,560
Well, let's see.

1199
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,600
I mean, there's certainly been, obviously, over the last week.

1200
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,320
No, I mean, they've been working on it for two years.

1201
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,720
It sounds like CodeWeavers may have

1202
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,000
been contracted for two years to work on this.

1203
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,440
Without realizing it, some of the fun and games

1204
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,200
that Poppy and I've had recently,

1205
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,440
publishing Windows games inside Snaps,

1206
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,400
builds on this very technology.

1207
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,040
We just didn't realize we were doing that until these

1208
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,900
announcements last week.

1209
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:16,360
So it's already a net positive for the Linux environment.

1210
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,880
This is compatibility and funded development

1211
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:26,080
around things that we already have a good productivity

1212
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,080
story on the Linux desktop.

1213
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,640
We already have an excellent developer story

1214
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,000
on the Linux desktop.

1215
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,760
And the conversation always comes around to games eventually.

1216
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,000
And we've had an OK to good story there.

1217
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,520
And we're on the cusp of having an excellent story there.

1218
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,720
So well said.

1219
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,180
Well done, Valve.

1220
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:49,360
You've put your money where your mouth is.

1221
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,200
And you're really making a difference where it counts.

1222
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,960
So one thing that I don't understand

1223
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:58,480
is where does negativity come with both Electron

1224
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,600
and this Proton?

1225
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,440
I don't understand, from my side, I only see positive.

1226
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,040
I don't see why anyone would see it negatively.

1227
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,040
That's pretty simple.

1228
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,720
Some people just don't like the fact

1229
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,080
that developers aren't being pushed

1230
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,040
towards using native technologies.

1231
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,500
It's the same old story that I've got a GTK desktop,

1232
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,920
and I hate the fact that there are Qt libraries loaded

1233
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,520
on my system.

1234
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,680
Or I've got a Qt-based system, and I hate the fact

1235
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,240
there are GTK libraries on my system.

1236
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,920
Or I've got a Qt, and I hate the fact that there's Electron.

1237
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,800
People should build natively, and everything

1238
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,420
will be super performant, and it should be written

1239
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,240
in native languages, or assembler,

1240
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:40,800
or they're misguided that they can berate developers

1241
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,760
into doing things differently to suit them

1242
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,240
when they are a tiny, tiny speck of an audience.

1243
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,040
You can't do that.

1244
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,840
You need to welcome these developers to our platform.

1245
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,760
I don't always agree with it, but I think also there's

1246
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,840
some amount of, at least for the desktop side,

1247
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,240
of people worrying about when you

1248
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,080
have a shim layer or a common abstraction,

1249
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,160
then you write to that.

1250
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,640
And it may not take full advantage

1251
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,760
of some of the unique features of various platforms.

1252
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,640
But if people aren't going to do that anyway,

1253
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,920
if people aren't, for instance, if people aren't making Linux

1254
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,280
games for you that you want to play or that the market wants,

1255
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,560
well, then you might want that.

1256
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,800
But if you're not getting it, what choice do you have?

1257
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,880
But Proton is a much stronger story in that regard

1258
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,440
to the other solution.

1259
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,120
So we've had the likes of virtual programming

1260
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,920
in the past, which, grossly oversimplified,

1261
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,160
are a wine wrapper around a Windows game.

1262
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:31,040
But it was all single threaded, and at least the Proton

1263
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,560
development offers up multi-threaded capability

1264
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,000
and a whole heap of other stuff besides.

1265
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,840
So you've got to appreciate that Valve are a means to market

1266
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,720
for games publishers, and they want games publishers

1267
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,960
to be able to exploit the processing capability

1268
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,240
of the platform that they're delivering on.

1269
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,960
And I think, as a solution, there are obviously

1270
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,000
some things about this we should be cautious about,

1271
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,200
but I think Valve have done everything possible

1272
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,440
to smooth things over for people wanting

1273
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,760
to target Linux through a compatibility layer

1274
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,960
as best as they can.

1275
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,280
And I really feel they should be applauded for this,

1276
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,640
because the Valve coming to Linux in the first place

1277
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,520
was a massive blooming turning point for adoption

1278
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,080
of the Linux desktop.

1279
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,760
And this will be even more so, considerably more so.

1280
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,080
It is as big a deal as everyone's hyping it up to be.

1281
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,200
I've already talked to several people that I'm like, look,

1282
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,280
you can play these games now.

1283
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,440
I know you were holding off.

1284
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,760
You have a Windows installed just for these.

1285
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,040
No more, my friend.

1286
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,440
I've had those same conversations,

1287
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,840
and people are very excited by that.

1288
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,000
But I think there's also an aspect of this

1289
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,960
that we're maybe not giving enough attention to,

1290
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,960
and I think it's on the tip of Minimech's mind,

1291
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,560
and that is Vulkan is the wild card in this.

1292
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,720
In some cases, we're going from very low-level DirectX 12

1293
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,080
calls, which are already quite similar to Vulkan,

1294
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,120
and just translating them to native, local Vulkan.

1295
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,240
And that's going to be a big piece, right, Minimech?

1296
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,280
Yeah, I think that's the whole thing.

1297
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,520
I mean, that whole thing is very future-proof,

1298
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,480
because as I understand, Windows games supporting Vulkan

1299
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:15,000
only have to translate the Windows game part, not

1300
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,360
the graphics rendering part.

1301
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,880
That is Vulkan that takes all the stuff.

1302
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,720
And the old DirectX thing is encapsulated in Vulkan,

1303
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,200
so it is a huge push for Vulkan.

1304
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,280
And I would like to have some responses of macOS,

1305
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,160
of the Apple people, about that.

1306
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,440
Yes, right.

1307
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,380
Oh, good point.

1308
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:35,480
There's terrible support for that kind of stuff on macOS.

1309
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,440
I mean, the kind of ebb and flow, like OpenGL

1310
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,440
is just horrible right now.

1311
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,600
But Metal support's fantastic, so I

1312
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,920
guess you just need one more shim to convert it to Metal.

1313
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,520
Yeah.

1314
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,520
Yeah, well, there is.

1315
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,000
There is.

1316
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,840
There's MoltenVK, which is like the shim

1317
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:57,240
to Metal for Vulkan API calls, which is very decent

1318
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:03,320
and can certainly facilitate those targeting requirements.

1319
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,780
But Valve were quite clear that macOS

1320
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,640
doesn't feature in this initiative at the moment

1321
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,740
or possibly at all.

1322
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,240
Well, could you blame them?

1323
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,960
Well, are Mac shipping many devices

1324
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,480
with significant enough graphics capability

1325
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,400
to be a serious gaming platform?

1326
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,700
And unless you're prepared to shell out 12 grand,

1327
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,360
the answer is no.

1328
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,040
So why would?

1329
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,640
I mean, that's like super niche.

1330
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,200
You think we're a niche audience,

1331
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:42,520
but those people that can afford an iMac Pro with the Vega 64

1332
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,800
option and everything else, that is a super niche audience.

1333
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,720
So you can probably appreciate why they're not

1334
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,480
investing effort there right now.

1335
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,240
Yeah, that's a point well made.

1336
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,000
I've got one thought at the back of my mind.

1337
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,360
OK.

1338
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,520
That I'm a little bit like, I wonder

1339
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,400
how this is going to play out.

1340
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,000
This is all great stuff.

1341
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,240
But as far as I'm aware, and I'm very

1342
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,640
happy to be proven wrong about this, so if you know better,

1343
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,480
do contact Chris, not me, do contact Chris,

1344
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,080
and let him know how wrong I was.

1345
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,800
He'll bring it to my attention in low bandwidth form.

1346
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,360
Wine is X11 exclusively right now.

1347
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,440
I wonder how much of this effort is

1348
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:33,960
going to be targeted at bringing Proton, stroke wine,

1349
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:38,360
to talk Wayland natively, or how much of this effort

1350
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,760
is purely going to be focused around implementing

1351
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,080
the compatibility necessarily on top of the X11 stack

1352
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:49,320
that these games run more reliably?

1353
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,000
And will this defer and push back

1354
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,560
the general acceptance of Wayland

1355
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,840
as a display server technology?

1356
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:03,520
Or will they become some of our most frequent ex-Wayland apps?

1357
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,560
That's a good question.

1358
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,720
And you have to wonder if it's not a chicken and the egg

1359
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,480
problem with graphics drivers.

1360
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,120
To really develop that, you would

1361
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,680
need a Linux box with full proprietary 3D

1362
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,720
graphics to troubleshoot and test.

1363
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,080
And you've got to get that first.

1364
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,640
Well, you'd do better with the fully open source

1365
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,880
drivers for Wayland stuff.

1366
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,360
Sure.

1367
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:31,400
So I'm not close enough to the development of these things

1368
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:36,320
to know how prioritized Wayland is in this story.

1369
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,800
And if it features at all, or if it features significantly.

1370
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,280
But I'll be very interested to see

1371
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,440
whether targeting Wayland is something that's

1372
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,040
of paramount importance, that it helps deliver Wayland

1373
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:54,040
to the Linux desktop, or if it's something that pushes back

1374
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,160
the acceptance of the Wayland desktop

1375
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,160
because there is a significant enough performance

1376
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,680
impact on these games being run through compatibility layers

1377
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,160
that people just aren't prepared to go there yet.

1378
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,920
Just as the transition to Wayland

1379
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:14,080
was looking simple and smooth, this has to come along.

1380
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,280
I can answer this because I'm working pretty closely

1381
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,120
with Wayland and Mir.

1382
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:23,000
And I would say the answer to this is NVIDIA.

1383
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,520
NVIDIA, they play proprietary drivers.

1384
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,560
They don't work at all with any of the Wayland stuff

1385
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:35,400
without needing to use their L stream APIs.

1386
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,840
And without NVIDIA support, most of the graphics

1387
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,760
cards that the game must have, which is NVIDIA,

1388
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,440
doesn't work on Wayland.

1389
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,820
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

1390
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:49,600
That's where I would expect the main cause of angst to be.

1391
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,120
And like I said, a bit of a chicken and egg there.

1392
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,440
And maybe somebody could reach out to NVIDIA

1393
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,560
and encourage them to pick up the pace on that.

1394
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,200
Maybe.

1395
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:57,880
We'll see.

1396
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,040
Somebody.

1397
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,800
There is no need to pick up the pace,

1398
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,760
though, on the community's development

1399
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,280
around Steam Play and Proton.

1400
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,440
There's already really cool sites set up.

1401
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,800
I'll recommend one called Proton.City.

1402
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,160
That's where I learned how to get Age of Empires 2 working.

1403
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,580
You just type in the game there.

1404
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:16,240
And then it'll tell you the status, the workarounds.

1405
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,040
It's a little slow right now because it's getting slammed.

1406
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,800
But they've got reviews and all of that stuff.

1407
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,400
And it's all dynamically generated.

1408
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,400
So it's Proton.City.

1409
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,960
And that's how I got Age of Empires working.

1410
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,400
And I'm very, very, very happy about it.

1411
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,440
There's also some lists.

1412
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,720
There's some Google Docs out there

1413
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,440
that have all of the games and their status and notes.

1414
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,600
And it's staggering.

1415
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,680
It's thousands of games.

1416
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,900
It's so staggering that it kills your browser trying

1417
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,280
to load the spreadsheet of the list of games.

1418
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,040
That's how massive it is.

1419
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,240
And there is just so much energy.

1420
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,520
There's so much passion.

1421
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,120
This is definitely a net positive.

1422
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,640
And I have hired people that are concerned that it will

1423
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,720
de-incentivize more native games.

1424
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,400
Steam was pretty upfront.

1425
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,800
And they had a good, you know, they talk right there.

1426
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,960
If I'm trying to target Linux natively, just target Vulkan.

1427
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,720
Use that.

1428
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,360
And hopefully, maybe less than in the desktop space.

1429
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,120
Maybe not.

1430
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,160
Games are already somewhat disconnected.

1431
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,600
Now, they do need a bunch of stuff

1432
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,360
to do to sound and tied to internet and all that.

1433
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,660
But they're already something that's not just another desktop

1434
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:16,200
application.

1435
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,360
They're a pretty niche use case that's

1436
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,340
segmented from a regular desktop.

1437
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:26,360
So I think we need a cheering test for Proton.

1438
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:31,240
And I think the rules for the cheering test for Proton

1439
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:35,360
are, can it run Fortnite yet?

1440
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:40,600
And until the outcome of that question is an unequivocal yes,

1441
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,840
then, you know, we're not there.

1442
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,640
But as soon as it runs Fortnite, then we're all sorted.

1443
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,640
Yeah, we do need to get that.

1444
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,640
We do need to get that.

1445
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,400
That is an embarrassing weak spot.

1446
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,980
I have not really gotten to Fortnite.

1447
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,480
But I have heard people bring it up.

1448
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,680
And everybody else, every other platform's got it.

1449
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,520
That's a good one.

1450
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,560
Does it run Fortnite?

1451
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,520
We will wait and see.

1452
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,640
I bet you it happens sooner than later.

1453
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,240
It's not published on Steam.

1454
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,240
So Valve have got no skin in the game

1455
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:08,400
on making that one work, right?

1456
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,360
I will include a link in the show notes

1457
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,840
on how to run Proton from the command line.

1458
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,600
So it is possible to just point it at an executable and go.

1459
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,520
So that might help.

1460
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,360
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes

1461
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,800
if I can dig it up again.

1462
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,440
Also, another link I'll have in there

1463
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,040
is, this also helps if you just want to use it sort of outside

1464
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:29,440
of Steam, is there's Proton tricks, like winetricks,

1465
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,180
that lets you set some of the registry stuff and whatever.

1466
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,680
I don't know whatever Windows calls it.

1467
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,720
So yeah, there's now Proton tricks

1468
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,680
where you can apply actions and whatnot,

1469
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,080
or apply it even to specific games and things.

1470
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,480
So people are developing tools around this, directories.

1471
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,160
There's just all kinds of stuff coming together.

1472
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,840
So it's a good time for this kind of thing,

1473
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,440
because it seems like the community was just

1474
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,480
super hungry for it.

1475
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,280
And within days, we've seen all of this stuff get set up,

1476
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,920
all of these resources, all of these games tested.

1477
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,880
It's like people are sitting around just

1478
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,560
waiting to play video games.

1479
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,400
Is there anything else anyone wants to chime in

1480
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,080
before we wrap this one up?

1481
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,960
Well, do we think there's going to be another round of Steam

1482
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,320
machine investment here now that it might actually

1483
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,280
be able to play some of the games you want?

1484
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,160
Right.

1485
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:18,840
Yeah.

1486
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,360
What is next for Steam OS now?

1487
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,960
And will it be a doubling down?

1488
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,160
Will it be integrated into big picture mode and all that?

1489
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:29,400
Or is this a acknowledgment that, you know what?

1490
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,280
You can go get Ubuntu 18.04.

1491
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,040
You can load our Steam package on there,

1492
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,520
and everything's good to go.

1493
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,520
The kernel improvements are all there.

1494
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,960
The graphics drivers work.

1495
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,680
And with our Steam client, we have all these libraries

1496
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,800
and Proton now.

1497
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,760
Maybe this is a shifting of the landscape,

1498
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,920
and Steam machines are just not as necessary,

1499
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,600
he says in a questioning voice.

1500
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,360
We'll have to wait and see.

1501
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,520
Yeah, I guess stay tuned and find out.

1502
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,900
That probably won't be what we're talking about next week,

1503
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:59,080
but we'd love to have you guys join us there.

1504
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,720
If you're all done, then that's good.

1505
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,680
We don't have to go get the links at linuxunplug.com

1506
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,560
slash 264.

1507
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,520
That's fine.

1508
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,600
You don't have to.

1509
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,920
But if you want a little more, you

1510
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,400
want a little more content, go check out the Ubuntu podcast

1511
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,480
where you can get more poppy and wimpy.

1512
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,320
And their cohort, Mark, is on the Ubuntu podcast,

1513
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,880
ubuntupodcast.org.

1514
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:17,400
Good episode.

1515
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,800
I love that episode on Academy.

1516
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,520
That was really fascinating.

1517
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,320
I thought that was a really well-done take

1518
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,360
on going to an event, too.

1519
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,640
Just going to an event and then summarizing it in a show

1520
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,520
is not always super easy, and I thought you nailed it, poppy.

1521
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,600
So great episode of Ubuntu podcast.

1522
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,400
Thank you.

1523
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,360
And go get more Wes Payne over at techsnap.systems.

1524
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,240
He's at Wes Payne on the Twitter.

1525
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,080
Do it.

1526
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,360
And the whole network is at jupitersignal.

1527
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,160
linuxunplug.com is our site.

1528
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,880
Thank you for joining us, and we will see you next Tuesday.

1529
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:49,000
And we'll see you next time.

1530
01:04:49,000 --> 01:05:16,120
All right, let's name this thing.

1531
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,440
Now wimpy, did the title go through

1532
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,240
that you were thinking we were going to see?

1533
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,760
Did that make its way through?

1534
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,080
Yeah, that made its way through.

1535
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,640
I went for a super long version and then trimmed it down.

1536
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,320
OK, let's go take a look at this thing.

1537
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,640
JBtitles.

1538
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,760
It's number one.

1539
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,200
I'm feeling confident in my prediction for this week's

1540
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,000
show title.

1541
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,320
Oh, my goodness.

1542
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,440
That is pretty good.

1543
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,280
It is long, but it is pretty good.

1544
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,200
I can give you an even shortened version.

1545
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,840
You can just go for proton electron for games.

1546
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,520
Yeah, that's nice.

1547
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,240
That's nice.

1548
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,400
That is good.

1549
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,760
All right, that's going to be pretty hard to beat.

1550
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,520
I also know that's going to irritate people

1551
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,640
that I know and I'm friends with horribly, but hey-ho.

1552
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,720
It's the meme.

1553
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,920
It's summarizing the meme within the peanut gallery

1554
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,160
in four words or less.

1555
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,640
That's all we've ever wanted from a title.

1556
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,120
I love it.

1557
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,160
I'm going for it.

1558
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,600
I'm going with the slightly shorter version, proton

1559
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,320
electron for games.

1560
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,600
Now what did we miss this week, Wes?

1561
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,480
Oh, I was just going to say, I was

1562
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,400
happy to see that proton counts as Linux for Steam Play.

1563
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,800
So if you're going to get surveyed,

1564
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,560
if you're running it through proton,

1565
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,000
it counts as Linux, not Windows.

1566
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,320
Yeah, that is a good point to make.

1567
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,560
Yeah, we should have made that in the show.

1568
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,920
It's always been this way, too.

1569
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,280
It's the way the Valve system works.

1570
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,280
It's whatever system you've played the most on

1571
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,080
after two weeks.

1572
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:41,840
Who here has purchased a game as a result of the Steam Play

1573
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:42,960
data?

1574
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:43,480
I did.

1575
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:43,960
I did.

1576
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,560
I bought Age of Empires.

1577
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,320
Yeah, so did I.

1578
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:49,400
I bought over a dozen.

1579
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,600
Oh.

1580
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,400
Well, they were in packs.

1581
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,800
They were racing stroke driving games in packs.

1582
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,120
So why wouldn't I?

1583
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,440
Now when the Steam sale is on, I'm

1584
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,160
not going to feel so limited.

1585
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,840
I'm going to just go crazy.

1586
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,320
And my wallet's going to be empty in no time at all.

1587
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,080
Yeah.

1588
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:08,840
That's very true.

1589
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:12,800
But you do need to check these community-driven,

1590
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:13,680
does it work?

1591
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:17,320
Because I was looking at those like, is my investment safe?

1592
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,600
You know, if I buy this thing.

1593
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,480
And the curious thing is, the only game that

1594
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:25,920
doesn't work for me is Doom, which is white listed.

1595
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:31,120
And I put my Steam client in give me all the things mode.

1596
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:35,720
And everything that I purchased outside of it's tested

1597
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:39,480
and supported worked until I decided

1598
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,120
I'm going to purchase Doom.

1599
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:41,600
Nothing.

1600
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,040
Black screen and music.

1601
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:43,880
That's all I get.

1602
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:44,840
I'm not going to do that.

1603
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,120
I'm not going to hold back.

1604
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:49,000
I'm just going to buy it and have the confidence

1605
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
that someone out there will fix this for me.

1606
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,120
And because there are going to be plenty of gamers out there.

1607
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,440
That is the Linux way, my friend.

1608
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:57,640
Yeah, I'll just rant on Twitter if it doesn't work.

1609
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:13,960
That's the way.
