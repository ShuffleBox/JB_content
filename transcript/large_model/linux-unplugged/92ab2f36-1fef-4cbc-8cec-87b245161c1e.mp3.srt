1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Sometimes there's these news stories that come across

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,180
and you're like, what is going on?

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,920
Like, what must be happening behind the scenes

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,660
to make this story a reality?

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,660
So Microsoft is working on AMD GPU hot plugging

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,900
for the Linux kernel, not AMD, but Microsoft.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,320
Yeah, I guess this is targeted at the data center.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,840
Microsoft said in a quote that,

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,160
we believe the support of hot plug of GPU devices

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,320
can open doors for many advanced applications

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,680
in the data center for the next few years.

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,280
So data center use, maybe for like,

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,760
adding GPUs to virtual machines and then removing it?

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,560
Yeah, Michael Larbo from Onyx kind of speculates

15
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,960
that this is for Azure hot adding and removing

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,500
of AMD accelerators for VMs, exactly.

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,840
What a wild, wild world.

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,800
And this, you know, wouldn't be possible

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,460
unless AMD was contributing their code to the Linux kernel.

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,960
And so now they get to benefit from the developers

21
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,080
at Microsoft improving the capabilities

22
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,620
of their hardware product.

23
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,920
I mean, it's for their own interest, but.

24
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,760
Well, on the flip side, right?

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,000
Like Microsoft doesn't necessarily have to work directly

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,120
with AMD, as long as they can get it reviewed

27
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,000
and accepted upstream of the kernel,

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,160
no one's stopping them.

29
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,160
Hello friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

30
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,800
My name is Chris.

31
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,720
My name is Wes.

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,600
My name is Brent.

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,520
And my name is Alex.

34
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,320
Hello guys.

35
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,200
How great it is to be in the same room with you.

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,160
Coming up on the show today,

37
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,400
we just got back from our big East Coast meetup.

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,040
We've got some great stories,

39
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,740
some observations about our fellow Linux users,

40
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,580
and a lot more.

41
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,880
Plus we're going to round it out with some boosts,

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,340
some picks, and much, much more.

43
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,940
I would normally introduce the lug right here,

44
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,280
but we had technical issues because we're on live location.

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,500
So we're not going to have a virtual lug today.

46
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
I apologize ahead of time.

47
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,400
It's heartbreaking.

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,680
Wes stayed up all night,

49
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,580
creating some sort of great, powerful contraption

50
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,420
to make this happen.

51
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,120
But unfortunately I came in here this morning

52
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,380
and I tore it all down, didn't know what it was.

53
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,320
And so we just don't have a mumbling.

54
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,560
Well, it had become sentient.

55
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,360
So I think that was the responsible move.

56
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,960
Yeah, it was a tough choice, but the show must go on.

57
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,320
But we do have so much to get to,

58
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,140
and you're going to hear from a ton of audience members

59
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,000
anyways that perhaps it's okay.

60
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,160
I hope so.

61
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,200
We're all hanging out here at Alex's house today.

62
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,040
It's pretty great.

63
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,280
So thanks for hosting us, Alex.

64
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,120
You're very welcome.

65
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,060
That is until my neighbor starts shoveling gravel

66
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,900
from his truck.

67
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,940
Well, it is a nice day out.

68
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,120
So, you know, we've got to get yard work done.

69
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,040
That is the only thing.

70
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,900
But I've been here since Thursday.

71
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,520
Brent, I think you've been here since Thursday.

72
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,640
Do we all come in on Thursday?

73
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,600
No, you came in on Wednesday.

74
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,520
Yeah, I came in on Wednesday.

75
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,480
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,360
I did come in on Wednesday,

77
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,480
but I stayed at a hotel the first night

78
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,240
just because we came in so late.

79
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,640
But it was Thursday that the team really assembled.

80
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,320
Yeah, yeah.

81
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,640
So yeah, I came in, I decided,

82
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,680
wouldn't it be nice not to do like a red-eye flight,

83
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,620
to just do like a midday flight?

84
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,460
How reasonable.

85
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,460
So in the Pacific Northwest, we flew out like 3 p.m.

86
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,680
on Wednesday last week.

87
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,480
And then we landed in Raleigh around 11.50 midnight.

88
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,360
And we didn't want to like wake Alex and his wife

89
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,200
and the baby up.

90
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,080
And we thought, we'll just land and do one of those

91
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,200
like right next to the airport hotels.

92
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,600
Just, you know, wham bam, quick and easy.

93
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,760
Yeah.

94
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,520
So we roll up to this place called a Microtel.

95
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,920
They call it a Microtel.

96
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,600
Which is like, really guys, what are we doing?

97
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,840
It's just like a cheap crappy hotel

98
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,440
that's been refurbed three times.

99
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,480
That's like a step above a nanotel though.

100
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,060
It's better than a nanotel.

101
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,280
So we go in there.

102
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,120
And as I'm opening the door, this guy rushes past me.

103
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,440
And he's like in a panic.

104
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,000
And he just like kind of brushes us out of the way.

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,880
And you know, we got our luggage and everything.

106
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,480
So we're kind of like taking up some space.

107
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,760
And he like kind of slams in past us.

108
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,140
Doesn't speak a lick of English.

109
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,000
So he takes forever to get his room booked.

110
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,640
Even like leaves for part of it.

111
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,960
And then the guy tries to like book us.

112
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,040
And then he comes back and he's even more in a panic.

113
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,480
And anyways, so then I'm like, that's not a great sign,

114
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,320
right, but we're starving and we're tired.

115
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,160
So I figured.

116
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,600
Get to your room, get some food, go to bed.

117
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,680
Yeah, let's just get this over with.

118
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,260
I'm excited about getting over to Alex's.

119
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,840
That's gonna be a lot nicer.

120
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,020
Let's just do this.

121
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,400
So I reinstalled the damn Uber Eats app on my phone,

122
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,500
which I just deleted because I was swearing off Uber Eats,

123
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,720
right, because it's so crappy usually.

124
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,240
But I figured, you know, the wife's hungry.

125
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,160
She's got diabetes.

126
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,340
She's got the low blood sugars.

127
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,780
I'm gonna take care of the situation.

128
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,440
Oh, look, the only thing nearby is a McDonald's

129
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,360
for a $4 freaking delivery charge.

130
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,460
Okay, fine, fine, it's 1 a.m., right?

131
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,840
So the moment we get the room,

132
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,180
like the moment we get the room number,

133
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,800
I place this order on Uber Eats, right?

134
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,280
And I'm a little kind of apprehensive about doing this

135
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,840
because I'm like committing to be in this place

136
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,200
for an hour, at least if I do this.

137
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,140
And I'm not sure this is the hotel we want to be in

138
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,600
because my initial impressions is maybe like

139
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,520
they're cooking something in the lobby,

140
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,600
but I don't see anything being cooked.

141
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,280
But it sure smells like something's being cooked.

142
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,240
But I think to myself, maybe in the back room,

143
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,720
like I made himself a meal, you know,

144
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,900
just ran the microwave.

145
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,040
What kind of smells are we talking about here?

146
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,880
Ethnic?

147
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,880
That's it, like all I can say is like smells of food,

148
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,200
clearly food, but not food I could identify.

149
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,740
I couldn't like, it were all like meals

150
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,760
I've never personally eaten, but I'm like,

151
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,780
oh, that's what food smells like.

152
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,220
Strong, unknown food.

153
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,680
Yeah, very strong.

154
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,320
But you know, the lobby, maybe they have a kitchen, right?

155
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,440
I don't know.

156
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,400
So after we get all checked in,

157
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,920
after I place my order, we get in the elevator

158
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,280
and the elevator smells like burnt rubber, real bad.

159
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,120
And what do you think about?

160
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,400
Like you get in an elevator and it smells like burnt rubber.

161
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,560
Doesn't sound like what you want.

162
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,080
You're thinking maybe like the tracks are bad,

163
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,780
like the little wheels it might have are bad.

164
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,660
If there's one vehicle you would really rather

165
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,800
didn't smell at all, it would be a Lyft.

166
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,840
Yeah, right, right?

167
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,160
And okay, so we get up to the second floor

168
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,280
and we step out and it's a whole new set of food smells.

169
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,880
Totally separate, totally different.

170
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,640
Maybe that's like a part of their brand, you know,

171
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,280
you get like a themed smell per floor.

172
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,520
Right, and then as you walk down this floor, second floor,

173
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,780
you walk through different zones of stink.

174
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,280
And I would actually probably describe it as stench.

175
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,800
And you would think that every single hotel room

176
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,980
had a kitchenette where they were making

177
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,560
their own individual meals,

178
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,280
although there are no kitchenettes in this entire hotel.

179
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,720
And it's like probably three or four different phases

180
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,880
of smell as we go to the very end of this hallway.

181
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,200
Cause of course you're walking down this torturous stench.

182
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,520
And of course our rooms at the very end of the hallway.

183
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,680
So you gotta walk past all of the stench.

184
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,020
My wife described it as a bouquet of stench.

185
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,960
So then you get to the door, you open the door up

186
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,600
and boom, you're hit with a totally different smell.

187
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,080
Oh, you finally learned what your rooms customs smell is.

188
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

189
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,560
And it's been sitting all day

190
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,080
and it was a humid day in Raleigh.

191
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,600
So it is moist in our bedroom, right?

192
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,960
And we're from the Pacific Northwest

193
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,200
where you don't really have that kind of like

194
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,240
hanging humidity.

195
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,900
And so like, it smells horrible.

196
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,240
We are damp, it's 1 a.m.

197
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,880
And I'm already on my second Uber Eats driver.

198
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,760
Like the first Uber Eats driver is already noped out.

199
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,600
And I'm on my second Uber,

200
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,640
I'm looking at the tracking screen,

201
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,120
like where's my damn burger, right?

202
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,000
So we look at the bed, we pull back the sheet,

203
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,200
the cover, you know, there's like a big liquid stain

204
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,880
and then like hair on the stain.

205
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,920
And then it's just sort of like artfully placed

206
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,200
at the tip of the stain, a cigarette hole.

207
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,400
Like I'm serious, I'm so serious right now.

208
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,840
Did you take a picture for Instagram?

209
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,760
I did not because I was in a bad place at this time.

210
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,240
I just wanted to eat.

211
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,320
So we're sitting there on the bed,

212
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,720
kind of like huddling together,

213
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,360
like on one edge of the bed on this like queen mattress

214
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,520
or whatever because like the other one's

215
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,560
just completely like a no-go zone now.

216
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,320
And this second Uber Eats driver just like nopes out.

217
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,180
And I'm like, two Uber Eats drivers have noped out.

218
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,880
We got a third one at this point.

219
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,440
I'm like, okay, well, what's going on?

220
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,800
This driver has been sitting at McDonald's

221
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,260
for like 45 minutes.

222
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,600
It's almost 2 a.m.

223
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,320
My wife's got, you know, low blood sugar.

224
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,340
I'm trying to get her fed.

225
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,920
Like let's figure out what's going on here.

226
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,260
So I text this guy and say, you know,

227
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,560
everything okay?

228
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,400
I send him the text message.

229
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,380
Two seconds later, food's on the way.

230
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,040
The guy's driving, right?

231
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,440
Doesn't text anything back.

232
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,600
Shows up at the old hotel.

233
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,520
Drops it off at our door.

234
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,400
Doesn't knock on the door.

235
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,800
Then sends me a text message saying,

236
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,880
your food's been gently placed by your door.

237
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,000
So I open it up.

238
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,360
It's somebody else's order.

239
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,240
It's not my order.

240
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,060
Oh no.

241
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,900
It's not my food.

242
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,560
It's a totally different set of food.

243
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,580
It's all cold.

244
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,400
It's all totally cold.

245
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,160
Like to the touch cold, right?

246
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,280
And then, so I'm like,

247
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,960
I slammed down some really bad burger

248
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,800
because I'm starving.

249
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,880
My wife slams down some really cold fries

250
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,240
because her meal wasn't even in there.

251
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,920
And then I go to bed, right?

252
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,300
But I've picked a place close to the airport.

253
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,560
So it's like legitimately in the path of the takeoff.

254
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,880
So as the planes take off,

255
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,400
they are flying over my room.

256
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,800
I got a nice view of the plane taking off.

257
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,640
And that's fine.

258
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,660
I started to get used to that,

259
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,480
but around 4.30 a.m. or so,

260
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,600
a plane came in for like a hard landing

261
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,440
and I swear to God,

262
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,480
I thought they were gonna hit the building.

263
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,880
It was shaking the bed.

264
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,540
I thought we were gonna die.

265
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,380
It was rough.

266
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,640
So I didn't sleep so good that night.

267
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,600
So it's really nice to be over here at Alex's.

268
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Maybe you would have been better with the red eye.

269
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,560
Yeah, I know, right?

270
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,100
The moral of the story is,

271
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,800
don't try to save money on a hotel room near the airport.

272
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,040
We went for the cheapest.

273
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,080
It was 90 bucks a night.

274
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,920
This is not that cheap, but these days it is.

275
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,520
You gotta remember, sleep is like a superpower.

276
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,420
I know, it really is.

277
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,060
It was a touch and go there for a little bit.

278
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,200
So it's been nice.

279
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,040
Alex has made us,

280
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,120
it's like at Alex's bed and breakfast here, you know?

281
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,960
So we got rooms, we got a kitchen.

282
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,760
You know, we should charge 90 bucks a night on Airbnb.

283
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,600
You could.

284
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,280
I think, I feel like you could actually.

285
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,320
And you got the cute dog,

286
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,360
so people are gonna wanna stay.

287
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,200
That's true.

288
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,040
Oh yeah, yeah.

289
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,360
With Airbnb, it would be a dog fee, $9,000.

290
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,200
Right. Exactly.

291
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,400
Now I know, so my,

292
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,020
like a lot of my bumpiness was after the flight,

293
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,320
like my flight and stuff,

294
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,760
that all went smooth, obviously,

295
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,700
cause I'm not complaining about it.

296
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,480
But Brent, didn't you end up in some sort of weird,

297
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,580
like multi-flight situation?

298
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,460
I know Wes did too.

299
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,660
So how was your trip in?

300
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,600
Actually, surprisingly,

301
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,180
usually I have a really great story to tell,

302
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,400
but this time it was really bland and boring.

303
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,240
That's good.

304
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,640
Which I think is what you're looking for

305
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,760
in terms of flights.

306
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,920
So I, the only thing I went wrong

307
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,300
was I spilled my Thai food under my seat

308
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,520
after they forced me to put my luggage up on the rack

309
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,360
instead of down there.

310
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,520
So I was a little.

311
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,480
Pad Thai down.

312
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,440
Yeah, Pad Thai down.

313
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,280
That's too bad.

314
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,680
And that went quite well.

315
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,800
And Wes?

316
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,580
I did take the red eye path this time,

317
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,480
just figuring, you know,

318
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
I'd seen your flight

319
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,800
and you were gonna get in pretty late.

320
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,680
I thought, okay, I'm still young enough, right?

321
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
I can handle a red eye.

322
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,500
I sleep. I love it.

323
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,340
It's about age.

324
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,880
I sleep decently most of the time.

325
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,720
I feel lucky in that regard.

326
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,220
And yeah, that part of it went just fine.

327
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,920
But, you know, as I land on the ground,

328
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,520
I had a layover in JFK.

329
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,120
As I land kind of groggy,

330
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,040
it's like five in the morning,

331
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,880
I'm waking up,

332
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,920
reconnect to LTE and get my notifications.

333
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,120
Your flight has been canceled.

334
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,960
I was like, wait, what?

335
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,400
Which flight?

336
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,240
The flight of mud?

337
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,140
No, that doesn't make sense.

338
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,560
My next flight?

339
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,120
I guess I'm in New York now.

340
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,040
No, thankfully not.

341
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,120
JetBlue had figured it out.

342
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,320
So by the time, you know,

343
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,400
by the time I'm off the plane,

344
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,440
I didn't have to go talk to anyone.

345
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,720
They'd already emailed me like an updated itinerary.

346
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,640
The only catch was the,

347
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,720
it added an extra flight.

348
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,920
And the first stop I had to do

349
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,560
was go from JFK up to Boston,

350
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,640
which is a 38 minute flight.

351
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,360
Oh, that's such a weird flight.

352
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,160
And because they were kind of having to reschedule things

353
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,240
after the cancellation,

354
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,200
of course it was delayed,

355
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
it took a while to get off,

356
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,240
but we still arrived earlier than expected.

357
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,460
So there was another plane already in our spot.

358
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,280
So it was probably like an hour and a half

359
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,320
or a two hour fare from like learning about it

360
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,160
to actually getting to Boston

361
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,980
for 40 minutes of air time.

362
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,820
Wow.

363
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,660
A 40 minute flight,

364
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,840
it feels like you're gonna spend more time

365
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,760
just getting on board,

366
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,460
sitting on the tarmac and getting off.

367
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,300
That was exactly it.

368
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,120
Yeah.

369
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,200
We were on the, we took Delta on the way out from Seattle

370
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,080
and you sit down, right?

371
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,080
And they're booting up all of the in seat displays and stuff.

372
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,120
And I'm like, look, look, honey, this is Linux.

373
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,960
Isn't that cool?

374
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,120
These displays all run Linux.

375
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,940
Oh yeah, that's neat.

376
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,780
You know, that's cool.

377
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,600
We're going on Linux event.

378
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,440
We're on Linux airplane.

379
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
Yeah, that's great.

380
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,280
Then we're on the flight

381
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,120
and the thing is so dog slow.

382
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,520
She's like, so this is your Linux, huh?

383
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,340
This is great.

384
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,180
This is.

385
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,960
Probably like a two point something kernel still.

386
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
Yeah, oh man.

387
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,600
Well, they're all doing like, they're doing like this weird

388
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,160
like shared display when they can.

389
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,560
I'd be really curious how this works

390
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,400
if anybody out there knows,

391
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,680
but like when you use the flight tracker,

392
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,880
all of the displays on the flight tracker screen

393
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,600
are all updating at the same time.

394
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,720
They're all in sync.

395
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,320
So is it one video feed

396
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,040
or are they actually running instances

397
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,880
of that flight tracker at, you know,

398
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,480
whatever amount of seats that are running it

399
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,920
and somehow they're still staying in sync.

400
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,160
I don't know, but it was a two core Linux system

401
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,640
cause it had two of the tuxes at the top of the screen.

402
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,280
Oh, I know, right?

403
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,760
I love walking through the airport

404
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,120
and like trying to observe like what devices people

405
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,080
are using, if they're using Bluetooth,

406
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,520
if they're using an Apple product or an Android product.

407
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,080
Saw a lot of laptops,

408
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,040
a lot of people using laptops in the airport.

409
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,840
Did you try any new tech on this trip?

410
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,000
Hmm, no, but it is the first time

411
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,980
I've used the Plex downloads feature

412
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,880
since they've introduced the Plex sync versus Plex downloads

413
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,080
and I don't really see a much difference.

414
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,920
It's kind of wonky because it recreates

415
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,320
the directory structure of your online server.

416
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,720
So because I pulled it down from two different servers,

417
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,160
I had two different like libraries I had to manage

418
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,080
instead of just all my downloaded videos,

419
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,960
but it worked nice.

420
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,540
We got the new season of The Expanse

421
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,280
and also Enterprise, season one.

422
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,120
And the nice thing is, is you can just say,

423
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
just sync down the stuff I haven't watched yet.

424
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,040
Hmm, that's killer.

425
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,940
And now the thing will be is how well does it do

426
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,160
syncing back what we watched?

427
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,560
So then when I go back to my,

428
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,520
are you starting fresh?

429
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,560
We'll see, we'll see, but that was nice.

430
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
But I think that was the only new tech

431
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,960
did either one of you guys do anything new tech wise

432
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,800
for this trip?

433
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,620
Oh, you did.

434
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,880
Yeah, I picked up some of those

435
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,000
Sony noise canceling headphones

436
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,240
and I haven't really had a good pair

437
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,160
of active noise canceling headphones before.

438
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,160
So that was sort of my trial run on the flight this time.

439
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,400
And it was nice, I think especially

440
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
because I was taking a red eye,

441
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
you know, just let me tune things out.

442
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,280
That extra flight from Boston too, it started off,

443
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,640
I was right at the very back,

444
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,480
like the last row of the plane.

445
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,160
And there was a pretty loud mechanical noise

446
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,120
like until it really got to cruising speed.

447
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,840
So that was handy.

448
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,640
And thankfully I hadn't really even,

449
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,480
this was sort of a last minute,

450
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,560
like, oh yeah, I'm flying,

451
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,640
I really need some new headphones.

452
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,160
Let's just get it, pull the trigger.

453
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,360
Hadn't tested it, but it works beautifully with PipeWire.

454
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,840
Ah, that's great.

455
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,560
You didn't do any new tech for you, Brent?

456
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,820
Or did you have it all dialed in?

457
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,280
I tend to not wanna try new things

458
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,160
because you know, if it's gonna fail,

459
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,000
it'll be when you need it the most.

460
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,920
Look at this guy, the reasonable one over here.

461
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,660
I was tempted to move to a new phone.

462
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,700
As you know, my sort of tried and true phone

463
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,540
is about to explode.

464
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,300
The battery is about twice the thickness

465
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,200
that it should be, so.

466
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,040
Legitimately, I keep telling him it's a fire hazard.

467
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,160
We just think it's definitely a fire hazard.

468
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,240
So about like three days before the trip,

469
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,580
I thought, oh, I gotta change.

470
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,480
I can't bring this thing.

471
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,700
This is just a hazard to everybody.

472
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,440
And, but I never got there

473
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
because the other phone I was gonna switch to

474
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,360
doesn't have an audio jack and.

475
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,400
Oh, the audio headphone jack.

476
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,040
Yeah, I got one of those little dongles,

477
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,760
but it was a cheap one like from the grocery store.

478
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,680
It was like the day before I was leaving,

479
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,160
so I couldn't order anything reasonable.

480
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,800
And it sounded awful, so I didn't even bring it.

481
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,520
Well, you know, when you got a phone

482
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,400
where the battery is grown outside the case,

483
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,720
where it's popped the back of the case off,

484
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,940
I'd probably say the best thing to do

485
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,240
would be taking it up on an airplane.

486
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,080
That's probably.

487
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,900
Yeah.

488
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,760
I like that his, you know, audio snobbery too,

489
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,160
is he's willing to put his own personal self at risk

490
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,000
just for that.

491
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah, cause you know, you put it in your pocket, right?

492
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,300
You know what's near your pocket, right?

493
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,140
Like.

494
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,960
Yeah, it's nice and warm.

495
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,800
I like it.

496
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,640
Oh, man.

497
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,240
I guess as long as it's keeping you comfortable.

498
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,080
Well, we have a lot to talk about today.

499
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,520
We had a hell of a meetup yesterday

500
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,400
and I tried to talk to people about

501
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,280
what Linux stuff they're doing,

502
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,960
what's not working for them with Linux,

503
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,560
what is working for them, what distros they're using.

504
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,880
And we try to get a flavor of who's out there.

505
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,760
And I think we did a pretty decent job.

506
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,680
You know, we always kind of evolve every meetup

507
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,160
and try to learn and adapt.

508
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,120
But before we get started today,

509
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,600
I have kind of a special announcement

510
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,640
I want to start the show with

511
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,980
cause I'm very excited about this.

512
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,480
And you guys know that we've been talking about

513
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,160
the future of podcasting in general

514
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,360
and JB shows in particular.

515
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,280
And you know about how particular we are

516
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,400
and how careful we are with the sponsors we pick.

517
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,480
And so I'm super excited to welcome Bitwarden

518
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,840
on board for Linux Unplugged.

519
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,920
They're on board for a little bit

520
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,100
and round of applause, right?

521
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,840
Because we're all Bitwarden users in here.

522
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,680
Yeah, we are.

523
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,200
And I think it's just an absolute great sponsor.

524
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,560
Now I'm not sure the landing page is live yet.

525
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,480
So the background here is Bitwarden has really made an effort

526
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,680
to support independent Linux content.

527
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,240
And so this is all kind of getting set up right now.

528
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,960
So bitwarden.com slash Linux is gonna be the landing page.

529
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,820
If it's not live when you hear this,

530
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,940
let them know maybe via support or some other way

531
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,340
that that's how you heard about it.

532
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,680
Because I'd love for them to stick around for a bit

533
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,920
because I think this is a great sponsor for the show.

534
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,520
So it's bitwarden.com slash Linux.

535
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,920
And you go there, you get started with a free trial

536
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,200
for a team or enterprise account

537
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,720
or for your personal account for an individual user as well.

538
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,100
And it really is, Bitwarden is just the easiest way

539
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,320
for businesses and individuals to store, share,

540
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,440
and sync sensitive data.

541
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,920
And it's not just passwords,

542
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,200
although that's the primary use case

543
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
I think a lot of us have for it.

544
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,240
But you can also store your two factor authentication

545
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,020
tokens in there, things like recovery passwords

546
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,640
for maybe like element.

547
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,600
And maybe your Bitwarden certificate

548
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,320
is what I realized I should be putting in there.

549
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,240
I use it to store secure notes.

550
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,560
So I have like WireGuard configs in there too.

551
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,720
Ah, that's a good idea.

552
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,320
Yeah, the attachments feature is pretty darn convenient.

553
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,440
Yeah, I like the idea of putting

554
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,100
my WireGuard config in there.

555
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,160
Yeah, so it's more than just passwords really,

556
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,200
but that is what's great.

557
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,700
And like the support for two factor authentication

558
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,780
is so nice because if you use it on mobile,

559
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,160
it really streamlines the whole process

560
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,680
of good passwords on mobile.

561
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,460
And I think that is really key.

562
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,560
The other thing they have now is account switching support.

563
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,460
How great is this?

564
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,440
So it's super easy to switch between your personal

565
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,020
and a business account or maybe a personal account

566
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,160
and an open source project that you're working with.

567
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,960
And one of the things that's given me confidence

568
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,920
to use Bitwarden is that I know they have

569
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,960
a self-hosted option available if I want it.

570
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,320
I can get that up and running if I need to.

571
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,120
I prefer to just get things up and going really fast

572
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,840
with Bitwarden Cloud.

573
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,760
I trust the security they have around that

574
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,080
and it just got me going immediately

575
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,040
and it made it super easy to share stuff.

576
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,760
And the other nice thing is either route,

577
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,920
they have a very large and active community

578
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,600
in both their forums and on Reddit

579
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,840
and really everywhere online.

580
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,720
Bitwarden just has millions of users.

581
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,400
So you get a lot of community support

582
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,800
if that's the kind of route you prefer to go.

583
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,600
A couple of years into using Bitwarden,

584
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,000
I think what I've really learned to appreciate

585
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,800
is how simple it makes bringing on team members.

586
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,760
Like Alex, you have a way where you use it

587
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,160
where you don't share all of your passwords with somebody,

588
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,520
you just share a few of your passwords.

589
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,360
That's right, yeah.

590
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,920
So my wife and I, I created an organization

591
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,040
and let's say there's a password to log into daycare

592
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,360
to pay the daycare bill or something like that.

593
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,960
We can both share that password

594
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,840
as part of the KTZ organization

595
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,920
that I've created in my Bitwarden kind of universe.

596
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,080
And we both have access to those passwords,

597
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,160
but it's on a need to know basis.

598
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,240
Yeah, I like that.

599
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,080
That's really nice.

600
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,400
And I've been able to do that with team members

601
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,160
when they come on or just like somebody

602
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,920
who's working on a project for us.

603
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,840
And it has made just keeping really good passwords

604
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,080
and safe passwords straightforward and simple.

605
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,500
And I think we all probably know this,

606
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,240
but it's a good reminder that just a good password

607
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,200
and good password hygiene is one of the few things

608
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,360
you can really do to notably improve your online

609
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,440
account security and your safety.

610
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,280
You probably already knew that,

611
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,360
but maybe somebody in your life needs to hear that.

612
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,200
So send them to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

613
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,000
Go try it for yourself, for your business,

614
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,680
and you'll support the show.

615
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,680
It's a great way to get started.

616
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,720
If you're an enterprise or if you're an individual user,

617
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,480
you can go there and get a free trial

618
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,360
at bitwarden.com slash Linux.

619
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,940
And it's free for an individual user.

620
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,920
You may find you don't need the cloud service.

621
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,320
I added it for the two factor support alone,

622
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,080
but there's a lot you can get out of Bitwarden.

623
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,120
Just go try it, go see it for yourself.

624
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,720
It's bitwarden.com slash Linux.

625
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,640
And a big welcome aboard to Bitwarden

626
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,640
for joining us on the show.

627
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,600
It's just super, super great to get support like that,

628
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,960
especially right now.

629
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,040
And you can support the show

630
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,000
by visiting bitwarden.com slash Linux.

631
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,240
All right, let's talk about our meetup.

632
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,560
I feel like there's a lot to talk about

633
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,800
and it's an exciting time.

634
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,640
I think we should,

635
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,800
maybe we should start with like the behind the scenes moment.

636
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,120
We did capture a little bit of like the sitting down

637
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
at the kitchen table and us having a conversation

638
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,860
before we left to the event to go like pick up food

639
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,920
and do all the things we had to do

640
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,200
before the event started.

641
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,600
So I'll take you back to like two hours before showtime.

642
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,400
We're sitting in Alex's kitchen.

643
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,940
It's about 15 minutes before we got to leave for the meetup.

644
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,560
Saturday morning on April 9th.

645
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,520
We've been here for a couple of days.

646
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,800
Yesterday was all about eating a lot of food.

647
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,160
And today it's not like we're,

648
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,960
we're not nervous or anxious,

649
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,080
but there's just so many things we still have to pull off

650
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,400
in the next two hours.

651
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,620
I think we're just anticipating,

652
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,480
we're just ready to get this thing started.

653
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,720
But also, super exciting that it's Wes's birthday today.

654
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,280
Happy birthday, Wes.

655
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,120
Wes.

656
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,560
Aw, thank you.

657
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,440
I really can't imagine anything better than,

658
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,600
I mean, being with the team in person.

659
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,440
Happy birthday to you.

660
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,120
With these amazing fools.

661
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,480
I mean, what could really be better?

662
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,720
And Alex's beautiful home,

663
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,280
which he has been so gracious hosting us at.

664
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,920
And yeah, you know, there's just been a lot of,

665
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,160
a lot of excitement and work to get here.

666
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,080
Alex scouting locations,

667
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,920
actually being willing to host us

668
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,760
and the community here in Raleigh.

669
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,160
And then just the small details,

670
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,120
things like rolling up t-shirts.

671
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,640
Rolling up t-shirts seems to be like the key

672
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,960
to a good event, doesn't it?

673
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,800
Well, you gotta have all the little pieces in place

674
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,660
so you're not distracted and you can actually, you know,

675
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,760
do the thing we're excited about,

676
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,580
which is interacting with our amazing audience.

677
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,000
Alex, how's it been having the whole crew

678
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,520
in your house, basically?

679
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,600
It's been a lot of fun.

680
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,720
I really, we're all just guests in Archie's house, my dog.

681
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,920
You know, but you know, to celebrate Wes's birthday,

682
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,000
Chris's iPhone just showed him a montage of past events

683
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
and 90% of the pictures were him and Wes recording audio.

684
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,240
One of those pictures was a beer picture.

685
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,840
So I think this afternoon at the brewery,

686
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,940
perhaps we need to, we need to fix that ratio.

687
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,320
We did do better.

688
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,200
We did do better.

689
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,640
I had a couple, I got a couple of ciders down the hatch.

690
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,480
You got a beer too?

691
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,520
Oh yes, I did.

692
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,140
So that, that worked out pretty good.

693
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,840
And even the line at the brewery was helpful

694
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,440
because it was a bit chilly yesterday, let's be honest.

695
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,080
And the brewery was nice and warm.

696
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,480
Everybody was troopers because the standing temperature

697
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,600
was like 55, 60 degrees.

698
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,000
But then you bring in that, you know,

699
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,260
15, 20 mile per hour wind chill and it was really cold.

700
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,080
So after three or so hours, maybe three and a half,

701
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,920
four hours, we actually got the whole crowd

702
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,400
migrate to the brewery.

703
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,360
I think that was some excellent foresight on Alex's part

704
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,440
to pick a spot that had an adjacent brewery.

705
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,680
Yeah, and a barbecue place.

706
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,200
And you know, there was all types.

707
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,800
So let's dig into that a little bit at this event.

708
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,900
I think we all got a chance to at least see the deck

709
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,000
floating around.

710
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,120
Listener Jeff brought his steam deck to the event.

711
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,720
And of course I had to go hands on.

712
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,280
Yeah, I have a steam deck.

713
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,600
I love it.

714
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,040
It's been a lot of fun.

715
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,280
I love it for being, picking it up and being able to play,

716
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,120
you know, five, 10 minutes of a game and put it down

717
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,600
and not have to worry about it.

718
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,080
And have you tried anything else with it at all?

719
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,720
Like poking around, exploring?

720
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,560
Yeah, I haven't had a whole lot of time to do that.

721
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,840
I did have this whole thing where

722
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,280
I was going to run Ansible and get everything figured out.

723
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,880
But with the Immutable OS, apparently

724
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,120
Flatpak's the way to go.

725
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,040
So I haven't exactly had a whole lot of time to play with it.

726
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,060
I do have KDE Connect on it so I can move things back and forth.

727
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,400
But that's about it.

728
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,200
It does look nice, new, and shiny.

729
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,240
Do you want to show Chris how it works?

730
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
Sure.

731
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,760
All right, OK.

732
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,680
Oh, we've got a game going too already.

733
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,560
Hades.

734
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,380
Hades, and it looks good.

735
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,920
Any tips or tricks for him?

736
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,320
Kill the skeleton.

737
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,720
I'm good at killing skeletons.

738
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,640
But you know, of course, the first thing I want to do

739
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,680
is I want to get on the desktop.

740
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,360
How do you get on the desktop?

741
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,480
Little trigger action or?

742
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,160
Yeah, so you've got to go down to this one.

743
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:10,160
Go down to power, A, and then desktop mode.

744
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,600
Switch to desktop.

745
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,360
All right, switching to desktop.

746
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,480
I'm going to bust out the track pads here.

747
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,480
Oh, it's kind of almost doing like a whole new loading thing.

748
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,080
There we go.

749
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,120
I got plasma.

750
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,240
That's fun.

751
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,040
That was easy.

752
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,080
Yeah, they've got to return to gaming mode.

753
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,120
They've got a virtual keyboard here.

754
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,640
It felt pretty good in the hand too.

755
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,640
You know, it felt pretty solid.

756
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,040
What did you think weight-wise?

757
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,320
Did you expect it to be heavier?

758
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
I expected a denser, heavier thing.

759
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,160
Yeah, me too.

760
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,920
It was about as light as a.

761
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,120
As a game, like a controller, like an Xbox controller.

762
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,080
Yeah, like an Xbox controller.

763
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,440
Like there wasn't a whole computer in there.

764
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,160
Yeah, it's crazy.

765
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,080
Yeah, I think the size would be more of the limiting factor,

766
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,480
just for portability and really the weight.

767
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,400
I thought the screen was great too.

768
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,280
We were in direct sun for a few little bits outside.

769
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,480
That's where it's going to be at its worst.

770
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,520
And it was fine.

771
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,960
Also, I mean, just I think this speaks to our audience.

772
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,800
He didn't quite get there, but I love the idea

773
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,920
of running Ansible on your gamepad.

774
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,280
I know, I know.

775
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,760
I know.

776
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,720
He also brought a pretty tricked out electric car too

777
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,760
that you got to ride in, Alex.

778
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

779
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,320
So this is Fuzzy Mistborn on the self-hosted Discord channel.

780
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,320
He brought the Hyundai IONIQ 5.

781
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,160
Hyundai, sorry, for the Americans.

782
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,600
This thing is a fully electric car,

783
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,360
and he just drove it down from Pennsylvania.

784
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,560
So he was a bit worried about the charging situation,

785
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,400
getting into town and stuff like that.

786
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,200
No problem.

787
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,240
No problem at all.

788
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,520
That's pretty slick.

789
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,840
And you got to go for a ride, and that's pretty great.

790
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,440
I did, yeah.

791
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,920
And he put this thing in sport mode,

792
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,480
and it pinned me back in my seat.

793
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,120
To get a petrol car that would do that,

794
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,560
you'd have to spend a lot of money.

795
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,440
Yeah.

796
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,560
I mean, we didn't really get a super official account,

797
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,760
because we didn't have a door, an entrance where we had

798
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,120
somebody counting and clicking.

799
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,560
No, we were just in a lovely park

800
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,680
where people were coming at us from every angle.

801
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,480
But we did buy 90 name tags, and they all disappeared.

802
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,520
So I think over the course of the afternoon,

803
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,640
about 100 people showed up.

804
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,120
I think so.

805
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,200
I think about exactly we asked, if you were going to go,

806
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,160
please try to sign up for the meetup, and people did it.

807
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,280
It was great, and it helped us plan for that.

808
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,800
I didn't sign up for the meetup, I'm sorry.

809
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,400
Great.

810
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,120
Sorry.

811
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,640
Somehow he snuck in anyway.

812
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,760
Yes, who led that guy in?

813
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,680
Party crusher.

814
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,920
So I don't know really how to describe it without saying we

815
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,080
just had all types there.

816
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,760
I mean, when I say that, I mean people who were longtime Linux

817
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,000
users, people who were brand new users to Linux,

818
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,960
people who were 11 years old, people who were 70 years old.

819
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,040
The whole range was there.

820
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,320
And one of the interesting couples that were there

821
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,000
was Jason and Kelly.

822
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,080
And they had come from Virginia.

823
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,280
So here we are at the meetup.

824
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,800
Tell us your names and where you came from.

825
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,880
I'm Jason.

826
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,200
I'm Kelly.

827
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,520
And we came from Alexandria, Virginia.

828
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,880
And for someone like me who has no idea how far that is,

829
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,560
how long would you have drove or?

830
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,760
It was a really long journey.

831
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,240
No, it's just about a four hour drive without traffic.

832
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,200
It's not bad at all.

833
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
And we actually have family in the Raleigh area,

834
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,920
so we were able to see them, multitask, and come here.

835
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,680
She graciously agreed to come with me to my Linux Nerdfest

836
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,720
meetup.

837
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,080
And what does the Nerdfest feel like for you?

838
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,680
Is it very inviting?

839
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,640
Oh, you know, I feel right at home here.

840
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,000
I have very nerdy brothers.

841
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,720
I have my own brand of nerdiness,

842
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,080
like Star Wars, fantasy, and sci-fi related.

843
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,360
You fit right in.

844
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,400
But not necessarily IT related.

845
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,520
But yeah, so no, it's great.

846
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,920
And how's the meetup for you?

847
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,560
Is this the first time you go to something like this?

848
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,480
This is the first time I've been to anything quite like this.

849
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,080
Closest I think before would be something like MAGFest,

850
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,600
which is like a music and gaming festival years and years ago,

851
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,920
because it's in the area that we live in.

852
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,360
But yeah, no, it's great.

853
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,240
It's so nice to finally put names

854
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,480
to faces from all the voices you hear on us and meet everybody.

855
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,960
Yeah, Jason and Kelly were really great.

856
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,360
And I would say that is true of most people.

857
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,360
But Jason was, I don't know, he stood out for me.

858
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,920
He told me that he worked at the Department of Defense

859
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,880
in the Office of the Inspector General.

860
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,760
I don't even, it sounds really interesting.

861
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,920
I don't know exactly what that is.

862
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,600
But he was the kind of person, and I saw this repeatedly.

863
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,640
You guys might agree with me, is that he was just

864
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,800
like insatiably curious about all the technologies

865
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,920
that he could get his hands on.

866
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,840
And so for instance, he said he learned Ansible recently,

867
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,280
which came up a lot.

868
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,000
And he said it just changed his world,

869
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,320
but also really made a really nice stride in his career.

870
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,120
He said that took him to a whole new level.

871
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,820
So I thought that was really interesting.

872
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,800
He said the Department of Defense, where he is,

873
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,880
runs all their stuff on Red Hat 7.9, which is interesting.

874
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,560
He was a little nervous about that.

875
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,640
Yeah, he was.

876
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,480
So I thought that was funny.

877
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,680
But he also said he works with a whole lot of data scientists

878
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,120
on some data analytics stuff, which sounded fascinating.

879
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,440
I love that there's Linux users everywhere.

880
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,560
So great.

881
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,280
This kind of lets us get a real sense of just

882
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,920
every weird little niche that Linux has found itself

883
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,840
over the years.

884
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,080
Yeah, yeah.

885
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,720
There's also those moments where you

886
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,200
meet people that you either click with right away,

887
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,320
or you share something in common with.

888
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,200
And we had those kinds of moments.

889
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,440
Of course, when you're named Chris,

890
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,080
you always meet another Chris at these events.

891
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,120
But Brent, you had a chance to meet another Brent.

892
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,900
My name's Arturo, and I drove here from Roanoke, Virginia.

893
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,800
So I had a six-hour drive yesterday

894
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,680
and a three-plus-hour drive today.

895
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,520
How about you?

896
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,760
I think we have something in common.

897
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,440
Yeah, we do.

898
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,880
Actually, I didn't have to drive that far.

899
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,520
It was all the way on the other side, actually,

900
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,200
over by the airport.

901
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,000
Did you fly into RDU?

902
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,500
Yep.

903
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,000
Yep.

904
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,720
So that was my drive in.

905
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,760
And my name is Brent.

906
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,200
And my name is Brent.

907
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,900
And you didn't have a name tag, did you?

908
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,880
No, I didn't have a name tag.

909
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,400
But I found another guy named Brent.

910
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
And it was good enough that he was able to share.

911
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,800
So it worked out pretty well.

912
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,840
I happened to put two layers on, and I put a name tag

913
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,440
on each layer.

914
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,120
And I was able to donate my name tag, which I think

915
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,960
is the first time that ever happens.

916
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,080
The Brents were so inseparable.

917
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,680
I mean, it was adorable.

918
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,280
They were great.

919
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,120
Well, you don't find them that often.

920
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,400
So they're all great people, I've got to say.

921
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,280
Now, if you're wondering, why did Brent have two name tags?

922
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,800
I'll tell you why, listener.

923
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,000
Because Brent is a damn pro.

924
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,920
That's why.

925
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,080
Because Brent had multiple layers of clothing

926
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,640
and had a name tag for each layer of clothing,

927
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,560
so that way he could remove his jacket

928
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,920
and he would still have his name tag on.

929
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,840
Not my first event.

930
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,760
Come on, gentlemen.

931
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,920
Say nothing else about Brent.

932
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,280
He's easily identifiable.

933
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,680
It reminds me of there's an episode of TNG, Star Trek TNG.

934
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,220
I don't know if it's Picard or who,

935
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,660
but somebody takes their jacket off, their uniform,

936
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,040
where they have their combat.

937
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,080
They take their jacket off, and there's

938
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,480
a combat on underneath.

939
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,560
That was Brent.

940
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,520
That was Brent.

941
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,360
You know, the thing, too, that's really nice.

942
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,360
So you get people that they deal with Linux users

943
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,880
and they deal with Linux and other admins all day,

944
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,960
every day.

945
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,400
That's totally their thing.

946
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,000
That's the world they live in, right?

947
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,300
But then you also have people that are listening to the show

948
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,300
or maybe they're participating in the Mumble Room

949
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,240
or they come to these meetups because it's

950
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,360
the only place they hear anyone else talking about Linux.

951
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,240
Yeah, so the strange thing is I actually don't, aside from,

952
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,000
you know, we have a lovely gathering here,

953
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,960
I don't actually know anybody else who runs Linux.

954
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,480
What?

955
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,680
Yeah, no, I am a chemist in a factory.

956
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,180
Cool.

957
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,500
So I do industrial chemistry.

958
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,920
It's got nothing to do with Linux,

959
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,360
although there are some mighty fun apps for it.

960
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,440
But it's always just been kind of a thing

961
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,560
I've been interested in.

962
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,120
The local group is the Try Lug.

963
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,960
They're pretty good folks, so I kind of

964
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,040
fell in with them a little bit, and here we are.

965
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,120
I heard you guys were coming all the way over here.

966
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,560
I couldn't not make the 20-mile drive over, so.

967
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,320
We have a good crowd here, like a really good crowd.

968
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,760
I mean, people came from New York and Pennsylvania

969
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,160
and Virginia and Florida, too, but a lot of locals

970
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,080
here in Raleigh.

971
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,360
Yeah, I was impressed.

972
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,600
I mean, Alex, you've got a good crew.

973
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,160
Yeah.

974
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,280
Home of the Red Hat, I mean, it's perhaps not too surprising.

975
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,960
Red Hat, there's a, what's the other largest tech company

976
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,480
here, too?

977
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,720
I don't think there's as big as Red Hat.

978
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,520
There's all sorts.

979
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,880
So Raleigh is actually a conglomerate

980
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,080
of three different cities, and we call it the Triangle.

981
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,600
There's Raleigh, there's Durham, and there's Chapel Hill.

982
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,640
And in the middle of these things

983
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,880
is about where the airport is.

984
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,640
And just over the road from the airport,

985
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,960
pretty much by your crappy hotel,

986
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,000
is RTP, Research Triangle Park.

987
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,960
And in there, you've got IBM, Microsoft.

988
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,600
You've got Pfizer.

989
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,640
There's dozens of big pharma things in there.

990
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,720
Lots of big tech, too.

991
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,080
Yeah, some other tech companies as well.

992
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,560
Yeah, so I mean, it makes sense in retrospect.

993
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,560
It makes a lot of sense in retrospect.

994
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,920
I feel like, though, we had such a good turnout.

995
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,600
And that was, you know, also what

996
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,840
has taught me is the first one you do is when you get

997
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,080
the smallest turnout.

998
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,480
And if you do another one, you get an even larger turnout.

999
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,280
And so we're already talking about,

1000
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,200
how are we going to do this on a yearly basis

1001
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,560
now, because this is awesome.

1002
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,360
You know, coming out here to see the people on the East Coast.

1003
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,520
Clearly, we've been neglecting a very serious audience base.

1004
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,120
I agree.

1005
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,160
And we can get a nice cadence going.

1006
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,000
If we have Linux Fest Northwest in the spring in Seattle

1007
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,640
on the West Coast, and then something on the East Coast

1008
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,680
in the fall, maybe.

1009
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,960
And Denver every now and then to sprinkle it in.

1010
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,160
And the other thing, of course, don't worry across the pond

1011
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,800
if you're listening thinking, what about over here?

1012
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,440
What about?

1013
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,400
Alex is already campaigning.

1014
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,360
I'm working the room.

1015
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:16,860
I'm working.

1016
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,160
I'm lobbying.

1017
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,400
So it's going to happen.

1018
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,240
But every now and then, you run into somebody.

1019
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,240
And I think sometimes they have like a message

1020
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,280
they want to relay to us.

1021
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,840
Like, they've been listening to the show,

1022
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,920
and there's something they want us to consider.

1023
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,520
All right.

1024
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,000
Hi.

1025
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,120
I'm Elaine Fu.

1026
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,840
In my day job, I'm a cloud and DevOps consultant.

1027
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,760
At night, I am deeply involved in the Armbian project.

1028
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,480
I've been involved for several years,

1029
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,960
working either with CI or just advocating,

1030
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,200
liaising between Eastern European folks and native English

1031
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,000
speakers, and mostly just fighting the good fight

1032
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
to let everybody know that there's a lot of stuff

1033
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,560
out there besides Raspberry Pi on ARM.

1034
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,080
I take that one personally.

1035
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,600
I feel like he's dragging that comment to me.

1036
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,160
Yes, Lane, I realize.

1037
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,580
And Armbian is a great project.

1038
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,040
We should probably do more work around that.

1039
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,280
Yeah.

1040
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,000
I think it just means that if you ever

1041
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,640
want to try some more interesting boards out there,

1042
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,120
other types of little tiny projects,

1043
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,620
you've got a support system out there.

1044
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,720
People like Lane Fu are working hard

1045
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,440
to make it run decently on other things besides the Raspberry

1046
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:20,920
Pi.

1047
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,960
And they're just like, pay attention, would you?

1048
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,640
We're working really hard to do this.

1049
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,560
Message received.

1050
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,280
We'll consider.

1051
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,480
We will consider.

1052
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,920
See, you come out to these events,

1053
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,920
you get us to think about these things.

1054
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,480
A lot of Python and Ansible love at the meetup.

1055
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,640
And how about you?

1056
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,320
My name's Sam.

1057
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,720
I'm from Richmond, Virginia.

1058
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm a Python programmer.

1059
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,800
That's my day job.

1060
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,960
I was an Ansible core maintainer for about five years.

1061
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,440
So long time Linux user.

1062
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,360
Just love everything about Linux, open source,

1063
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,800
and automation in Python.

1064
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,720
That's basically my wheelhouse.

1065
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,600
Sam's all about it.

1066
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,360
And he had a lot to say.

1067
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,440
And the thing is a lot of people had good things

1068
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,320
to say about Python and about Ansible.

1069
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,380
And Nix, there was some Nix love as well.

1070
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,360
There was also some Nix shame.

1071
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,920
Dusty came out, and Dusty made a hard pitch

1072
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,160
for trying out the Fedora core stuff, the core OS stuff.

1073
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,360
I think we've got to give that a fair shot too.

1074
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:14,960
It's only fair.

1075
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,480
I mean, you come to a meetup.

1076
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,800
Dusty made a good case.

1077
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,000
So Dusty said, automatic updates.

1078
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,640
I know how you like that.

1079
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,320
But also, they have these tracks you can subscribe to.

1080
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,600
And one of them is a testing channel

1081
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,720
that you can subscribe to.

1082
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,360
And you'll get your, I think you said a week or two weeks?

1083
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,140
You get two weeks heads up of all changes.

1084
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,280
So you throw one machine in this testing channel,

1085
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,120
and you get a good solid week heads up of changes.

1086
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,720
Because they're all automatic updates.

1087
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
You see where it goes.

1088
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,120
And if that system doesn't break,

1089
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,840
then your production system is going to be OK.

1090
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,960
But hey, who are you kidding?

1091
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,800
We're going to run testing on all our production machines.

1092
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,320
Sure.

1093
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,240
Yeah, I'll believe that when it happens.

1094
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,000
So the nice thing about core OS in particular

1095
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,520
is how it boots from one image or partition at a time.

1096
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,140
So you can update the image you're not booted into

1097
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,720
currently whilst you're booted into the previous one.

1098
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,360
Then you reboot into the new image.

1099
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,480
And if that's broken somehow, you just

1100
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,520
fall back to the old image.

1101
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,680
Like a kernel in grub.

1102
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,000
Yeah.

1103
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,200
Yeah, that does sound good.

1104
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,560
And that also sounds consumer friendly for a device.

1105
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,160
You can see where you could build in a system where

1106
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,040
if the user is power cycling or something,

1107
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,880
there's a little bit of logic that just says,

1108
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,880
use the last image.

1109
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,620
Well, I mean, isn't that some of the stuff

1110
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,600
that Valve have had to invent for the way

1111
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,240
they're deploying Arch on the Steam Deck?

1112
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,280
Yeah, I actually kind of wonder.

1113
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,000
I mean, I know we're hyped right now.

1114
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,920
And I'm saying this before we've gotten our hands

1115
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,320
on Steam OS 3.

1116
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,280
Acknowledged and kind of wish we had already

1117
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,680
seen this Steam OS 3 stuff.

1118
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,080
But wouldn't it be interesting if in like five years

1119
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:46,200
we look back at this and go, Valve was on the right path,

1120
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,820
but they just totally implemented

1121
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,780
like their own thing when they could have used something

1122
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,360
like Nix or something like CoreOS

1123
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,260
or anything that uses OS 3.

1124
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,880
I wonder if we'll feel like good idea, bad implementation.

1125
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,560
Kind of like Munich.

1126
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,000
When Munich first did their own thing, we were like, oh, man.

1127
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,280
The whole state is switching to Linux?

1128
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,140
And then we found out their own custom distribution thing.

1129
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,160
And they spent like six, seven years flailing around

1130
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,560
trying to make that work.

1131
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,360
And the whole time we were all just going,

1132
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,080
why didn't you just use Ubuntu?

1133
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,700
Maybe that's what's happening right now with the Deck.

1134
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,200
But we're too early in the cycle.

1135
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,040
We're all too hyped right now to realize it.

1136
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,320
So you're saying just skip Steam OS 3.0 and wait till 4.0.

1137
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,160
That'll be the good one.

1138
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,960
Maybe.

1139
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,000
Then again, maybe Linus was right.

1140
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,240
Maybe Valve is going to start with Steam OS 3.0.

1141
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,360
And they're going to build a consumer product that

1142
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,120
is following some of these best practices.

1143
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,320
And it ends up being the leading largest desktop use

1144
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,040
of this kind of technology.

1145
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,160
Linus said that it was going to be Valve that brought Linux

1146
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,800
to the desktop masses.

1147
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,160
So maybe this is the start of it.

1148
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,280
And so maybe we'll look back at it

1149
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,200
and think they were geniuses.

1150
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,280
Does this mean that this is the year of the Linux desktop?

1151
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,320
Oh, Alex.

1152
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,520
You know, I was seeing a conversation about this online

1153
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,020
recently, and I'm curious to know what you guys think.

1154
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,520
But the basic premise is that whole concept

1155
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,640
of the year of Linux desktop is harmful,

1156
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,400
because it creates this set of expectations.

1157
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,780
And the reality is that it's a slow march,

1158
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,240
and that it becomes the year of the Linux desktop for each one

1159
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,600
of us individually.

1160
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,480
And by having this idea, we are doing the whole movement harm

1161
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,120
and not recognizing the actual successes we're seeing.

1162
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,440
What do you think of that idea?

1163
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,080
Yeah, I mean, I think there's probably

1164
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
a lot of truth in that.

1165
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,840
But partially, I also think, does anyone

1166
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,880
take the year of the Linux desktop seriously anymore

1167
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,400
anyway?

1168
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,520
No, it's a total joke, right?

1169
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,720
I think everyone might already recognize that already.

1170
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,540
I think we do.

1171
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:38,140
I think the Linux community realizes

1172
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,280
it's a meme at this point.

1173
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,120
But I also hear people outside the Linux community

1174
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,560
still throw it in our face as like, oh, yeah,

1175
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,120
how's that year of the Linux desktop coming?

1176
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,240
It's a very valid point.

1177
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,720
I think my year of the Linux desktop

1178
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,280
was about five or six, seven years ago when I was first

1179
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,040
getting into Linux.

1180
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,400
And since then, it's become a tool

1181
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,080
I used to do various tasks.

1182
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,800
Right.

1183
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,240
And kind of assuming that there's

1184
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,000
this minimum benchmark it must meet,

1185
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,640
it's not really how computers work, is it?

1186
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,680
Because Windows and Mac aren't great for everybody either.

1187
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,840
It also sort of tries to assume an audience or a certain scale

1188
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,760
that tries to say, like, that's what makes it matter when,

1189
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,320
especially these days with the relevance of desktops

1190
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,240
in general, it doesn't seem like maybe it's

1191
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,440
the right concept.

1192
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,320
Yeah, you don't really want to be

1193
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,840
the winner of the thing that's kind of already on the out.

1194
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,800
I mean, I'm going to use a desktop for as long as I can.

1195
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,840
I'm not saying it's gone forever, but let's look

1196
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,040
at the sales numbers.

1197
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,280
It sort of tells its own story.

1198
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,080
So we also had a special moment here.

1199
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,160
In fact, I honestly wouldn't have been offended or surprised

1200
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,320
if you said, sorry, guys, I'm talking to Wes.

1201
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,780
Sorry, guys, I'm not going to be able to make it to this event.

1202
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,780
I got stuff going on because it was Wes's birthday.

1203
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,120
So we wanted to make it special since Wes decided

1204
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,640
to spend his birthday with us.

1205
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,880
We wanted to acknowledge that at the meetup.

1206
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,000
And Alex, like a pro, seized the moment.

1207
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
All right, where's Wes?

1208
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,480
Hello.

1209
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,760
Wes, come here.

1210
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,480
Chris, come up here, too.

1211
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,360
All right.

1212
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,480
It's not my birthday.

1213
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,040
Thank you all for coming so much.

1214
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,560
Oh, yes.

1215
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,080
Yes.

1216
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,920
JP Fam, thank you.

1217
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,080
This is really, really cool.

1218
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,240
I think we're all here, pretty much.

1219
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,520
I think people are coming, but.

1220
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,760
This was a completely unplanned, accidental thing.

1221
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,520
But today is Wes's birthday.

1222
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,020
Hey!

1223
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,520
Hey!

1224
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,020
Hey!

1225
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,520
Hey!

1226
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,020
Hey!

1227
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,020
Happy birthday, Wes.

1228
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,520
I didn't know until yesterday.

1229
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,480
So we bought him a birthday cake.

1230
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,800
You're all welcome to have some.

1231
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,040
There's one proviso.

1232
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,280
Happy birthday to you.

1233
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,280
Boop, boop, boop.

1234
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,760
Happy birthday to you.

1235
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,260
Handsome.

1236
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,240
Happy birthday, dear Wes.

1237
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,720
Wes, happy birthday to you.

1238
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,220
Hey!

1239
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:39,720
Hey!

1240
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,220
Hey!

1241
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:40,720
Woo!

1242
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,720
Thank you, everyone.

1243
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,220
All right.

1244
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:42,720
There's a cake.

1245
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,280
You have to come cut it.

1246
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,000
Yeah, there is cake.

1247
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,360
There was way too much cake.

1248
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,480
What do we do with all that cake?

1249
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,520
We've still got half the damn thing in my kitchen.

1250
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,280
Both of them?

1251
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,560
Yes.

1252
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,640
I think we'll be packing on the pounds this trip.

1253
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,360
Yeah.

1254
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,360
But thank you for spending your birthday with us, Wes.

1255
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,800
I can't imagine anything better.

1256
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,800
Aw, geez.

1257
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,280
Aw, geez.

1258
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,560
That was pretty nice, though.

1259
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,320
And everybody just was totally, immediately in on it.

1260
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,880
Like, there was no convincing.

1261
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,240
The whole crowd just immediately got in on it.

1262
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,760
It was great.

1263
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,200
Which I was very relieved of, because my singing voice is not

1264
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:13,640
the best.

1265
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,120
No.

1266
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,360
If it was just you and I up there singing,

1267
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,240
it would have been very embarrassing.

1268
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,960
That's what stands out so much about these meetups, you know?

1269
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,920
It's total strangers.

1270
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,280
We've never seen 90% of these people.

1271
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,680
Some of you, unfortunately, we may never see again.

1272
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,800
But it's like an instant community.

1273
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,960
We all know why we're there.

1274
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,020
We're there for the same reasons.

1275
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,560
We have the same interests and hobbies

1276
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,060
and generally the same philosophies.

1277
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,520
And so there's just like a weird and wonderful amount

1278
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,160
of implicit trust that just kind of happens.

1279
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,600
Yeah, like a lot of the basic social fabric

1280
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,800
exists, because you can immediately talk about, well,

1281
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,840
so how far away?

1282
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,920
Where'd you come from?

1283
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,940
Because everybody has that in common.

1284
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,640
And you can talk about anything in Linux.

1285
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,120
Anything you feel like talking about.

1286
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,760
You want to talk about Wayland?

1287
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,800
Go ahead.

1288
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,760
It's so much simpler from a social interaction standpoint.

1289
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,120
And so what you see happen every single time we do these events

1290
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,480
is at first, it's sort of about us.

1291
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,200
And people kind of cluster around us.

1292
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,920
And then about an hour into it, everybody's

1293
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,880
talking to each other.

1294
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,880
Like people even who maybe don't have great social skills,

1295
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,840
maybe they don't interact with people a lot.

1296
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,000
But because we all have this in common,

1297
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,840
and we all understand these terms,

1298
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,280
like if somebody is out there talking about HTOP,

1299
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,560
people know what HTOP is.

1300
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,760
Like how common is that?

1301
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,160
That's not very common in your real life.

1302
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,400
My favorite thing was to come up to a bunch of complete

1303
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,920
strangers and just hear the word Tasmota.

1304
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,840
I'm like, hey, we can talk about that.

1305
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,360
That's fun.

1306
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:36,960
Let's go.

1307
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,640
Right.

1308
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,520
I was impressed with some of the audience members

1309
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,160
just being so kind and generous too.

1310
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,840
You know, we had people offering to show other folks around.

1311
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,720
Or the number of times I saw someone,

1312
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,480
they were kind of standing outside the circle a little bit,

1313
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,680
maybe not sure where they wanted to go next.

1314
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,680
People are just always offering, expanding the circle,

1315
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,760
and welcome you right in.

1316
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,480
Yeah, very true.

1317
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,880
Then I also had a special moment.

1318
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,280
So we had Wes's moment, and I had a special moment

1319
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,720
which was totally unexpected.

1320
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,980
So Nixie, everybody out there is probably familiar with Nixie.

1321
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,880
She's been in the Linux community forever.

1322
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,880
And she's got a YouTube channel that she does a lot of security

1323
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,600
content on.

1324
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:15,240
And they have, her and her crew, have this amazing 70s era GMC

1325
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,040
RV.

1326
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,920
And if you're an RVer at all that has

1327
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,200
any kind of historical RV background,

1328
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,680
you know these GMCs were like peak RV.

1329
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,480
And I had a chance to actually see one of these

1330
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,280
that was in full operation.

1331
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,840
20 years I've wanted to see one of these.

1332
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,340
20 years?

1333
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:30,840
Really?

1334
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,080
Yeah.

1335
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,560
So this is actually how I got it.

1336
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,240
It was actually set up as a desk like this, and it was a?

1337
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,320
Server rack.

1338
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,640
It was a server rack, yeah.

1339
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,440
It is a server rack.

1340
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:41,940
Yeah.

1341
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,480
And he had closed circuit TV systems that he could plug in

1342
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,240
and had monitors up here to monitor

1343
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,960
some sort of security thing.

1344
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,720
An RV with a server rack.

1345
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,520
How cool is this?

1346
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,840
I finally see a GMC and it's got a damn server rack in it.

1347
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,080
Yeah.

1348
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:56,520
Where are you?

1349
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,480
Why haven't you done this?

1350
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,440
I can't believe this.

1351
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,000
So I don't know if this rig, I don't

1352
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,080
know if they pull up at clients and hook up

1353
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,040
to the security system or what they were doing,

1354
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,000
but this thing was like a mobile RV security system.

1355
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,580
I'm imagining some ethernet that you've

1356
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,680
plumbed through on the outside and you just

1357
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,000
sort of plug it into the building.

1358
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,880
Yeah, yeah.

1359
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,800
It's pretty neat.

1360
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,120
Very cool rig.

1361
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,760
You guys should Google this thing, the GMC RV.

1362
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,640
They only made this.

1363
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,640
So it's the only one they ever made.

1364
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,840
So you're not going to have any problems finding it.

1365
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,040
And it is very special.

1366
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,120
And Nixie was talking a bit about that.

1367
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,480
I mean, I just think it's really amazing how it handles.

1368
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:28,980
Oh, yeah.

1369
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,160
So it doesn't handle like a Greyhound bus.

1370
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,200
It handles more like a limousine.

1371
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,360
Like a limousine, baby.

1372
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:35,840
That's great.

1373
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,720
Yeah.

1374
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,880
It is such a cool rig because it has

1375
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,200
a super low center of gravity and air suspension in the back.

1376
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,600
And it has dually tires.

1377
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,120
And it's just the whole thing is just so friggin' awesome.

1378
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,400
Real treat for me.

1379
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,480
And also just like I love that there's

1380
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,280
people in my audience who show up

1381
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,240
at an event like this in their RV, right?

1382
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,800
That's amazing for me.

1383
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,120
So that was a good time.

1384
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,340
Beautiful rig.

1385
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,920
I think if the Jetsons designed an RV,

1386
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,920
that's the design language that we had here.

1387
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,080
This thing was just so cool.

1388
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,580
Yeah, Chris, how did you describe it?

1389
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,080
You said it was like retro future or something?

1390
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:09,800
Yeah, it is.

1391
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,800
Is that a weird design?

1392
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,680
But that's the thing.

1393
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,840
It's like future retro.

1394
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,000
So it is also retro.

1395
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,360
But it is also kind of how we're designing things now.

1396
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:17,840
Well, yeah.

1397
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,480
It was the idea from the past of what

1398
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,080
the future could be in a direction

1399
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,080
we unfortunately haven't quite taken.

1400
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,080
Because as you also said, that thing

1401
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,360
had a very Star Trek shuttle pod feel.

1402
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,320
There's this curved glass in the cockpit.

1403
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,040
Just seeing photon torpedoes.

1404
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,460
They don't make them like that no more, I'll tell you what.

1405
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:34,960
They don't.

1406
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,320
But at that time, they wanted to build an RV where

1407
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,280
they followed what the airline builders followed.

1408
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,180
So when you're building a traveling jet,

1409
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,560
like a 747 or something like that, all the building

1410
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,200
policies, and even down to the paint.

1411
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,560
The paint they chose was airplane paint.

1412
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,640
And so as a result, the paint, it needs polished.

1413
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,200
But the RV's paint still is on and holds up

1414
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,520
after all these years.

1415
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,680
And meanwhile, modern RVs just disintegrate

1416
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,520
after 10, 15, 20 years.

1417
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,720
You know something a little bit about that.

1418
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,440
And they also don't make it out of corn wire.

1419
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,280
So that also is a very good thing.

1420
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,760
I also thought the suspension system

1421
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,320
was like a whole weird, brand new, crazy thing.

1422
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,520
Like that the wheels were able to turn slightly a little bit.

1423
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,200
Just a little.

1424
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,120
And it sounded like both sides of the rear suspension

1425
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,200
worked in concert.

1426
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,440
So that let's say, unfortunately, you

1427
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,760
were driving into Denver, for instance,

1428
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,520
and you found a large bump in the road,

1429
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,960
maybe a pothole on one side.

1430
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,240
And you hit that.

1431
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,560
They were explaining how that would actually only shift

1432
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,320
the suspension by about half of that distance,

1433
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,840
because each side can independently kind of absorb

1434
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,000
that and kind of cantilever back and forth.

1435
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It was really fascinating.

1436
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,840
I would say, if that sounds interesting in any way,

1437
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,540
go check this thing out.

1438
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,000
I'm sure there are lots of videos

1439
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,200
of people explaining the suspension.

1440
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,080
It was really neat.

1441
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,160
I'm just picturing one day I pick one of these things up,

1442
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,240
and I build a mobile studio.

1443
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,440
Come on.

1444
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,800
In a GMC from the 70s, how cool would that be?

1445
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,000
You have to store it here, though.

1446
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,920
Totally, dude.

1447
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,360
Yeah, we'd probably have to build it here, let's be honest.

1448
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,040
If you inspire us like that, I think we might all need one.

1449
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,680
Because what?

1450
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,920
We can't all record in yours.

1451
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,040
The sound isolation is just not going to be good enough.

1452
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:22,680
Yeah, that's true.

1453
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,200
lino.com slash unplugged.

1454
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,280
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account.

1455
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,820
And you go there to support the show.

1456
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,700
I mean, let's just be honest about it, right?

1457
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,040
lino.com slash unplugged.

1458
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,000
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

1459
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,800
If you've got something you want for your next project,

1460
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,800
something you want to deploy up in the public,

1461
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,600
I'd be embarrassed not to put it on Linode.

1462
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,160
And I legitimately mean that.

1463
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,440
It's not just that it's super fast and has great performance,

1464
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,480
but if anything goes wrong, they also have fantastic support.

1465
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,200
I pinged their support recently.

1466
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,360
So I have a recent story to share with you,

1467
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,080
because I decided to go full baller on our matrix

1468
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,200
server before we left.

1469
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,440
I didn't want to be over here and have the matrix server

1470
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,400
fall down.

1471
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,400
So I pinged Linode, and I'm like, hey, guys, how's it going?

1472
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,020
So I know how I have this $15 a month Linode here.

1473
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,020
Here's what I want to do.

1474
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,360
And I kind of just ran them through what

1475
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,520
I'm thinking about.

1476
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,440
And they sent me back kind of a response

1477
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,800
and gave us a few ideas and gave us the green light.

1478
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,320
So I turned this thing up to 11.

1479
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:26,200
Our matrix box, we went from 16 gigs of RAM.

1480
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,680
We now have 96 gigs of RAM.

1481
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,360
We now have 96 gigs of RAM in that thing.

1482
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,960
We went from six CPU cores to 48 CPU cores.

1483
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,480
We now have 48 CPU cores.

1484
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,720
Going to need a lot of workers.

1485
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,440
My god.

1486
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,320
Yeah.

1487
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,000
We are cooking with gas on our matrix server now.

1488
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,320
It is so slick.

1489
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,800
It's not the final solution.

1490
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,720
But you know what?

1491
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,680
When you can throw hardware at it, why not?

1492
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,440
And isn't this the nice flexibility

1493
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,200
I have as a business?

1494
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,080
Because the last thing I want is this thing

1495
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,240
crashing while I'm on a trip.

1496
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,120
But you don't have to commit to some giant new server thing

1497
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,560
that we would have had to take a couple of weeks

1498
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,920
to get provisioned and set up before we left, right?

1499
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,000
You can just do it now.

1500
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,040
And if we figure out a solution that

1501
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,520
means we need to scale back down later, that's easy to do too.

1502
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,880
Click of a button.

1503
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,600
Click of a button.

1504
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,640
That's the thing.

1505
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:14,960
Is it resized an existing system we already had in production.

1506
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,400
And it resized it in minutes.

1507
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,160
And now the box has like infinite power.

1508
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,920
So I love that kind of stuff.

1509
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,760
And it's just the sort of thing I could never

1510
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,920
do with a physical box or even some janky VM setup

1511
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,360
that I'm running on my machine.

1512
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,680
So if you're a performance hound,

1513
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,240
if you're a reliability hound, if you

1514
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,000
want to be like in like slim with good support,

1515
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,280
Linode is the way to go.

1516
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,140
They got 11 data centers around the world.

1517
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,680
You're going to find something near you or your customers.

1518
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,960
They've been doing this for nearly 19 years.

1519
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,960
And they just keep making it better and better and better.

1520
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,520
I love it.

1521
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,800
I think you're going to love it.

1522
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,200
I would suggest you try something.

1523
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,480
Go kick the tires and see it for yourself.

1524
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,360
That $100 means you can really try something.

1525
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,040
And make your own decision.

1526
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,160
And trying it out supports the show.

1527
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,380
So go to linode.com slash unplugged.

1528
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,880
Get that $100 on a new account and support the show.

1529
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,360
Linode.com slash unplugged.

1530
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:13,520
We have a little bit of feedback this week.

1531
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,160
Rafael wrote in about NexOS.

1532
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,080
We've been getting a lot of those.

1533
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,040
And I thought it would be a great question

1534
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,000
to put to all of you since we're in the same room.

1535
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,400
They write, my dream is to be able to access

1536
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,600
a mostly persistent single version of my development

1537
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,860
environment on any machine in my local network.

1538
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,840
I do hobby app development on Flutter,

1539
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,720
which has a relatively complex install procedure in Linux.

1540
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,880
Rarely do I get enough time between dad duties

1541
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,800
to update, run git pull, and do a system update

1542
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,020
if I haven't used a particular laptop in a while.

1543
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,320
What I'd like to do is somehow host

1544
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:51,360
a persistent configuration of my workflow and OS

1545
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,000
that's always up to date and ready to work on my development

1546
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,640
project with minimal interruptions,

1547
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:01,040
such as the changes from one system to the other.

1548
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,680
He says he has a small home server that

1549
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,680
might be useful in the mix.

1550
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,320
And he wondered, is this possible with Nix,

1551
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,880
or are there any other solutions?

1552
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,200
You know, Nix does have a fair amount of facilities

1553
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,160
for setting up a development environment.

1554
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,160
And if you're using something like Vim and Emacs,

1555
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,660
I know they've got a lot of support

1556
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,080
for including configuration for those types of editors

1557
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,360
in there as well.

1558
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,040
I think if Nix is the right fit might depend on, well, one,

1559
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,840
if you like using Nix, but then two,

1560
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,840
kind of what tools you're using for development

1561
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,120
and how well that fits in the next ecosystem.

1562
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,640
Because some ecosystems, I think Go is pretty well supported,

1563
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,000
MPM, there's some new exciting stuff for Clojure

1564
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,320
I just happened to notice.

1565
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,360
Those work well, but there's other ecosystems.

1566
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,440
I think Ruby sometimes could be painful from what

1567
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,880
I've heard that just maybe fewer of those packages

1568
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,520
have made it into the Nix package store.

1569
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,360
So those are the things I would check out.

1570
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,680
But there might be a lot of ways to skin this cat.

1571
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,960
Containers can be a nice way to set up development

1572
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:52,920
environments.

1573
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,040
Or if it's just on your local network,

1574
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,300
I know you guys really love the remote VS code set up over SSH.

1575
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,680
So maybe you don't need to copy the environment everywhere,

1576
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,360
and you can have one master install that's

1577
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,480
able to reach out to the other systems.

1578
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,600
That's a good idea.

1579
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,760
I hadn't thought about that.

1580
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,680
Yeah, if that's truly what you're looking for,

1581
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:13,080
you probably could get a minimum viable version with that.

1582
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,320
I was thinking you could solve this with WebTop

1583
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,400
with the container solution, where essentially it's

1584
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,160
a Docker container that creates a desktop Linux environment

1585
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,620
that you connect to over your web.

1586
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,120
It's like a self-hosted version of shells.com.

1587
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,040
Oh, very nice.

1588
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,720
So you could do something like WebTop.

1589
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,640
But you don't want to hear this.

1590
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,640
What I hear, I mean, maybe it's because I'm old,

1591
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,880
but I hear VM.

1592
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,160
I hear VM with free RDP server running on it

1593
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,520
that you just RDP into.

1594
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,600
And now that GNOME 42 has exposed options

1595
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,160
to set up an RDP server, you could set up a Fedora

1596
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:45,320
workstation in a VM with free RDP server running,

1597
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,720
and then you could just RDP from any machine on your network.

1598
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,360
And honestly, I'd recommend using

1599
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,280
one of the higher end RDP clients,

1600
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,000
because if you use the actual Microsoft RDP client,

1601
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,940
you get a pretty performance session.

1602
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,240
It's not bad with the new GNOME server.

1603
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:58,920
That's an option.

1604
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,960
I mean, I hear VM.

1605
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,760
I do get what he's trying to get at, right?

1606
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,480
Raphael wants to just sit down and get to work, right?

1607
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,080
It's like when I go to play a Steam game

1608
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,000
and I end up spending 15, 20 minutes just

1609
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,520
getting my machine capable of playing that game.

1610
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,760
Less of a problem these days, but still happens sometimes.

1611
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,240
I get it.

1612
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,380
Raphael wants to just sit down and get to work.

1613
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,200
And I'm trying to think of what would be simpler and quicker

1614
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:21,840
than RDP.

1615
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,120
I mean, Alex, do you have any ideas of like,

1616
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,480
maybe is this another option?

1617
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,440
Maybe just a dedicated laptop?

1618
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,240
I'm a big fan of the Westpane VS Code remote suggestion.

1619
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,240
I do that for a lot of my development, actually.

1620
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,160
And I think perhaps the one thing that

1621
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,400
makes this more difficult is the Flutter element, where you

1622
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,840
actually need some UI elements on screen.

1623
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,840
That potentially makes this more difficult,

1624
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,800
because a lot of my development is for infrastructure as code

1625
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,560
type stuff, more DevOps-y type things.

1626
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,960
So UI development, really, you need the environment locally.

1627
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,840
But if you can capture all of these requirements

1628
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:01,440
as to what makes your development environment yours

1629
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,760
and get that into an Ansible playbook,

1630
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,680
you should play the bell whenever

1631
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,440
I mention the word Ansible, I think.

1632
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,640
Maybe a Badger sound effect?

1633
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,240
We need an Ansible sound effect, guys.

1634
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,240
A quick stinger.

1635
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,280
We do, yeah.

1636
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,680
Now, for me, if you can capture all that into a nice playbook,

1637
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,280
that then becomes your repeatable deployment thing

1638
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,920
that you sync between machines.

1639
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,320
And in fact, you don't even really

1640
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,160
need to sync the Ansible itself.

1641
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,840
You just commit that to a local Git repo,

1642
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,800
sync that between the machines, and then

1643
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,440
run Ansible against all of these machines

1644
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,320
whenever you sit down.

1645
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,080
Have it as a cron job, if you like,

1646
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,040
to get more into that kind of GitOps kind

1647
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,200
of style of operation.

1648
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,560
That's a great idea.

1649
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,760
Greg Hellings also wrote in onto our GitHub.

1650
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,480
I kind of grabbed this because I thought it was fascinating.

1651
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,800
This is the GitHub for the NixOS challenge that we set up.

1652
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,920
If you want to check that out, github.com

1653
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,880
slash jupyterbroadcasting.

1654
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,000
And he writes, about four months ago for a day job,

1655
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,440
I began experimenting with the Nix package manager

1656
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,320
in order to enable developer tooling to run in Linux,

1657
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,520
as well as Mac OS.

1658
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,440
Currently, we officially only support Mac OS.

1659
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,840
Having come here from Red Hat, this task

1660
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,640
was naturally assigned to me.

1661
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,080
Nix packages will allow us to eventually unify

1662
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:16,200
the same packaging system across Mac and Linux.

1663
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,440
He says, bonus, it also allows us to run under the WSL2

1664
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,320
on Windows.

1665
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,560
The same package manager in all three systems.

1666
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:26,840
I thought that was pretty brilliant.

1667
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,640
That is something I've been hearing a couple of times

1668
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,440
from people.

1669
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,440
Yeah, it's pretty nice.

1670
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,960
I've been trying out using Nix lately on my work Mac.

1671
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,640
And yeah, so far, it's going pretty well.

1672
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,000
I've been impressed with the number of packages

1673
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,920
that are supported.

1674
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,960
It sounds like from talking with some of the folks

1675
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,600
on our Nix matrix channel that the Darwin support,

1676
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,400
as they call it, has gotten a lot better just

1677
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,720
in the past couple of years.

1678
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,120
So if you tried it before, it might be worth checking out.

1679
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,800
And it's really easy and light on the system.

1680
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,760
So if you just want an alternative,

1681
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,320
if you're already using something like Brew,

1682
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,040
I know before the show, we were kind of messing around

1683
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,280
and wanted to brew package update one of our machines.

1684
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,280
Of course, that takes a while.

1685
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,560
And when you're trying to do a live stream, it's not great.

1686
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,360
But Nix is pretty fast, and it's a nice alternative.

1687
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,280
Yeah, I actually feel like the time

1688
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,080
is right for the Nix packager to strike on macOS.

1689
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,560
I know it's been around for a while.

1690
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:16,520
But Brew has a lot of people that are not happy with it.

1691
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,720
And what is the new project that one of the Brew founders?

1692
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:24,600
I mean, it seems like there's some perhaps weakening

1693
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,280
in Brew's dominance in macOS package management.

1694
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,800
I feel quite the opposite.

1695
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,800
I actually install everything on my Mac using Brew.

1696
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,760
So I install Chrome, Spotify, Mumble.

1697
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,760
There's a package for literally everything in Brew these days.

1698
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,360
And that's where it really wins.

1699
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,760
And I have a question for you, Wes.

1700
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,600
I haven't done anything with the Nix package manager yet.

1701
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,920
But I've heard this promise before with Terraform

1702
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,320
as the example, where you write one script

1703
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,760
or you define one configuration.

1704
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,080
And then that becomes your golden configuration

1705
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,760
for all your things, except for the fact that's never true,

1706
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,960
because package names are actually slightly different

1707
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,320
on different OSes and stuff like that.

1708
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,240
Is that a solved problem with the Nix package manager?

1709
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,120
That's a good question.

1710
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,480
I don't know if I'd say that it's quite solved.

1711
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,320
And admittedly, I'm kind of just starting off

1712
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,760
on this road myself.

1713
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,120
But I have been impressed with the flexibility of overrides.

1714
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,800
I haven't quite got it dialed in.

1715
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,360
But one thing I was trying out was building cross-compiled

1716
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,120
Docker images from Mac without having

1717
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,520
to use any of the Docker tools that would spit out

1718
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,180
like a Linux container with all the right Linux binaries

1719
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:29,960
and stuff.

1720
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,320
And for the most part, that was just

1721
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,760
one little change at the top of the file that was like, hey,

1722
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,060
here I want to pull in packages that run on the Mac side.

1723
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,880
So these are the native packages to run.

1724
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,260
And then for the stuff that's going inside the container,

1725
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:44,240
I want you to pull from the x86 part of the Nix package cache.

1726
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,000
Really?

1727
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,560
So I think that there's some promise.

1728
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,620
Now, of course, as you're right, abstractions are leaky.

1729
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,160
I'm sure there are some edge cases

1730
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:51,960
that are going to bite you.

1731
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,680
But at least for the simple stuff,

1732
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,120
like in getting an htop and things like that going,

1733
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:59,520
yeah, just kind of install it by name and go have fun.

1734
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,720
I feel like at the meetup, it was a pretty good mix

1735
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,040
of people who thought we were crazy for this Nix stuff

1736
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,280
and people who were like right on board with us doing

1737
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,560
the challenge.

1738
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,840
I feel like that's about the split in this room, too.

1739
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,340
Yeah.

1740
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:10,840
Yeah.

1741
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,340
Yeah.

1742
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:11,840
Yeah.

1743
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,320
Yeah.

1744
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:20,000
And now, as the French say, it is time for le boost.

1745
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,440
We got a bunch of boosts in.

1746
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,960
And for 5,000 sats, bhh32 wrote, thanks for the fountain app

1747
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:27,840
recommendation.

1748
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,240
I've been listening to you guys for a few years now.

1749
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,800
I've never had an opportunity to attend a live show.

1750
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,000
And this is a great way for me to support you and participate.

1751
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,080
Here are 5,000 sats for you, easily funded

1752
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,160
from my Exodus wallet, since it has its own lightning wallet

1753
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,560
that I can deposit from my mining efforts.

1754
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,520
And I mine exclusively on Linux, open source funding

1755
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,840
for open source shows.

1756
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,400
That's rad.

1757
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,320
Pretty crazy to think he's using open source software

1758
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,440
to mine something that generates value that he can then

1759
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,160
send in with a message to a podcast that

1760
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,000
talks about open source software,

1761
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,680
using all open source self-hosted software

1762
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,080
on the back end for every single piece of it, right?

1763
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,960
You can't say that about a Visa transaction.

1764
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,320
Not a Windows box in sight.

1765
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,880
No, no.

1766
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,600
Michael B wrote in yesterday with 3,000 sats, hey, guys.

1767
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,960
I'm so glad that you're banging on things like Matrix

1768
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,600
to help us all getting all of this sorted out.

1769
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,620
Keep up the great work.

1770
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:26,400
Michael, you know, the Matrix community continues to grow.

1771
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,800
And was it, I don't know if we really

1772
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,880
touched on this last week.

1773
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,880
Like, it was implicit in the conversation,

1774
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,240
but there was like a hot minute like three months ago

1775
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,440
where I'm like, screw this.

1776
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,640
I don't want to host this.

1777
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,840
Discord is way easier.

1778
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,480
Why am I bothering with this?

1779
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,400
And I was like, let's kill the Matrix server.

1780
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,720
Yeah, we really, I mean, we thought about it.

1781
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,520
But then all these damn bastards started joining the server,

1782
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,560
and they're all so great.

1783
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,000
I want to talk to them all.

1784
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,160
And now I'm all in.

1785
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,620
Like, we've got to keep this thing.

1786
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,720
And also, I think the other thing that's

1787
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,440
been sort of building over 2022 for me

1788
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:04,160
is I have really started taking a look at centralization

1789
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,080
in the Linux community and the negative effects.

1790
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,000
I think that centralization has brought

1791
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,440
Linux and Linux innovation.

1792
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,360
And then I started using that perspective

1793
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,080
to look at how we do messaging and look at how we communicate

1794
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,440
as a community.

1795
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,860
And I realized that there's value long term

1796
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:22,160
in helping build the Matrix ecosystem because

1797
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,960
of its decentralized nature.

1798
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,760
And that's sort of where I decided

1799
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,200
I'm going to double down on it.

1800
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,320
So that's why we now have a 48-core box

1801
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,680
with 96 gigs of RAM running our Matrix server.

1802
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,480
Fingers crossed.

1803
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,640
We decided to go crazy.

1804
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,200
Well, Marcus boosted in with 10,000 sets.

1805
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,160
I hope these boosts and streaming sets

1806
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,160
help allow JB to grow.

1807
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,440
And hey, by the way, Chris, I was the person that sent you

1808
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,960
a 3DS a few years ago.

1809
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,880
That was so awesome when Marcus did that.

1810
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,720
Thank you, Marcus.

1811
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,340
Because my son and I really got into some of the 3DS games

1812
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:55,080
for a little bit.

1813
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:59,200
And so we both had one and made for a nice moment.

1814
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:04,880
User 183 also sent in two days ago 12,000 sets.

1815
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,800
That seems impressive to me.

1816
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,520
Great live stream last week.

1817
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,100
Thanks for the 2,000 sets.

1818
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,360
We were sending sets to people, which I think

1819
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,600
they really enjoyed, clearly.

1820
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,360
Yeah.

1821
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,080
I guess they sent it back and then some.

1822
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,560
Now have BTC on Blue Wallet and SATs on Fountain.

1823
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,920
So here are yours returned and a few more.

1824
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,680
If you've not mentioned it before,

1825
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:28,060
worth highlighting Flat Seal, which, among other settings,

1826
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:32,000
allows confined Flatpak apps access to NFS shares

1827
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,840
and mounted partitions.

1828
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,440
Martin?

1829
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,380
Yeah, Flat Seal is a solid Flatpak companion.

1830
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,320
Just one of those things, quality of life,

1831
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,400
is you try to do more complicated workflows

1832
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,200
in your Flatpak apps.

1833
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,280
All right, so Wes, I think you probably found this one.

1834
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,500
Based on the functionality for our pick this week,

1835
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,440
it's called BORE.

1836
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:55,960
Yeah, a modern, simple TCP tunnel that's written in Rust.

1837
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,880
Yes!

1838
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,160
Yeah, you might wonder, OK, why would I need this?

1839
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,660
Aren't there already things like ngrok?

1840
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,700
And yeah, they acknowledge that right in the readme.

1841
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,500
It's similar to a local tunnel in ngrok,

1842
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,040
and there's a lot of tools for this.

1843
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,600
But BORE is intended to be a highly efficient, unopinionated

1844
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,440
tool for forwarding TCP traffic that's

1845
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,320
simple to install, simple to self-host,

1846
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,160
with no frills attached.

1847
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,000
And yeah, it's true.

1848
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,240
I was able to take a look.

1849
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,800
It's less than 400 lines of safe, asynchronous Rust.

1850
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,480
So you can read through the code if you like.

1851
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,440
And because it's Rust, it's easy to get started.

1852
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:32,800
You just run BORE server on maybe a Linode system

1853
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,300
out there.

1854
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,400
And then you can use your own to forward reports.

1855
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,760
So if you're behind some firewall,

1856
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,040
you've got NAT in the mix.

1857
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,560
It's just really easy and simple.

1858
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,600
So let's say you're a guy who's maybe on a flight,

1859
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,400
and they're locking down what you can get to on this flight.

1860
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,440
Is there a way I could use this to get access

1861
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,840
to more things without pain?

1862
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,960
I mean, I'm not saying I'm doing that, but I'm asking for Brent.

1863
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,040
You know, that's a use case I hadn't considered.

1864
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,400
Could a guy do that with this?

1865
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,840
Or like, I'm trying to picture what

1866
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,040
I would use this in the day-to-day.

1867
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,280
Well, I think it's just a nice way,

1868
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,720
if you don't have a fancier setup,

1869
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,680
or you don't want to invest in other persistent tooling,

1870
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,480
you just need sort of an ephemeral port forward.

1871
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:06,320
That sounds like me.

1872
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:06,760
Yeah, right?

1873
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,040
You haven't got your firewall configured.

1874
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,440
You don't even know how the firewall works.

1875
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,120
Who can bother?

1876
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:10,620
Mm-hmm.

1877
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,040
Who can?

1878
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,760
And so that's where this is really nice, because one, you

1879
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,840
can self-host it, or they run what

1880
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,440
seems like a pretty beefy server on their own.

1881
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,400
And so you just run this on your local machine,

1882
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,680
tell it what ports you want to forward,

1883
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,120
and then instead of having to set up a reverse proxy

1884
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:26,200
or open that port on your firewall, it's done for you.

1885
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,740
Isn't it interesting how we talk about these picks sometimes,

1886
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,120
and you dig into it, and you discover

1887
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:33,400
the open source project is also running a server component

1888
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,840
to help make it work better?

1889
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:39,560
Like, you don't have to use it, but Magic Wormhole, Jitsi,

1890
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,280
Bore, the list goes on and on.

1891
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,280
Like, it's very common these days

1892
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,400
to have that little kind of server-side component.

1893
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,680
And so that's an aspect you've got to take into consideration.

1894
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,000
Absolutely.

1895
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,520
Maybe, if you find it useful, you

1896
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:51,960
want to support those kinds of projects.

1897
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:52,560
That's right.

1898
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,400
I think that's probably true, and we

1899
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,920
don't want them monetizing that aspect of it,

1900
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,120
because that's not good for any of us.

1901
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,560
All right, you know, it's a shorter show today,

1902
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,280
because we didn't have a Mumble Room.

1903
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,480
Yeah, I mean, we're going to try to do something

1904
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,320
in the post-show, so if you're a member at unpluggedcore.com

1905
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,280
or at jupiter.party, yeah, then you get to hear the post-show,

1906
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,320
and you're going to see if we get it to work or not.

1907
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,800
And not to mention the rather not safe for work conversation

1908
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,560
we had today.

1909
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,480
This is why you show up live, folks, all the extra show.

1910
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,120
You're going to hear Chris rant and rave about technical

1911
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:21,620
setups.

1912
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:23,480
That's always fun, you know?

1913
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:26,160
You get the full perspective and the spectrum of emotions.

1914
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,280
I'm a little worried about that guy.

1915
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,440
You know, you can get that whole thing.

1916
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,240
That's always fun.

1917
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,480
Who doesn't want that, right?

1918
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,640
So check that out.

1919
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:32,760
You can join us on Sundays.

1920
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,560
We do the show at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern,

1921
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,280
over at jblive.tv.

1922
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,760
We'd love to have you join our virtual lug,

1923
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,440
because it's almost like it's like 99% of the time,

1924
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:45,760
99.5% of the time, it makes its way into the show.

1925
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,600
It's just when something gets broken,

1926
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,880
then it doesn't make it in here.

1927
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,240
But you can always watch live.

1928
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,560
See you next week.

1929
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:54,040
Same bat time, same bat station.

1930
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,960
All right, that's it.

1931
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,240
That's our live show, all hanging out.

1932
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,640
Is this considered a living room?

1933
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,240
What is this considered, a bonus room?

1934
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,720
Officially, I think it's a bonus room.

1935
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,040
Yeah, the room above the garage.

1936
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,120
Yeah, hanging out in the bonus room.

1937
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,680
In this case, bonus means a totally capable for recording

1938
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,200
a podcast.

1939
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,800
I think it's now a podcast room.

1940
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,920
I don't think I've ever seen anybody

1941
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,840
look quite so comfortable as Wes Payne, who's

1942
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,480
recording from my La-Z-Boy today.

1943
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,640
Yeah, this is amazing.

1944
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,040
We had to really put it in the studio to share this.

1945
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,560
That is a nice spot.

1946
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,400
All right, thank you so much for tuning in.

1947
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,360
Keep the Linux rolling at linuxunplugged.com

1948
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,120

1949
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,120

1950
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,200
and get it in front of us.

1951
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,360
We read them all.

1952
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,040
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

1953
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,280
of the Unplugged program.

1954
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,000
See you back here next Sunday.

1955
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,600
And remember, the Unplugged program,

1956
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,680
the new show, is brought to you by Linux.

1957
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,000
So don't forget to check us out.

1958
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,280
And hopefully, you're all enjoying it,

1959
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:42,440
and we'll see you next week.

1960
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:42,960

1961
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:43,440

1967

1970
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:49,680

1971
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,480
Bye.

1972
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,160
Bye.

1973
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:51,840

1974
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,560

1975
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:53,000

1976
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,120

1977

1978
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,080
Bye.

1979
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:55,560
Bye.

1980
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,160
Bye.

1981
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:56,680
Bye.

1982
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:57,120
Bye.

1983
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:57,520
Bye.

1984
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,040
Bye.

1985
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:58,520
Bye.

1986
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,200
Bye.

1987
01:05:59,200 --> 01:05:59,840
Bye.

1988
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,280
Bye.

1989
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:00,760

1990
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:01,280

Bye.

1993
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:02,960
Bye.

1994
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:13,320
Alright, JBtitles.com, let's go pick our title.

1995
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:17,480
I like, like, the chatroom's asking, like, what's the deal with the Rust love?

1996
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,320
Seriously, why does everybody love Rust so much?

1997
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,320
Yeah, maybe I got a little defensive there, whoops.

1998
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:24,320
Does it feel like, I mean, I mean, besides the fact that we are getting some awesome

1999
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:28,480
applications and it's making people rethink stuff, I think in part it's just sort of,

2000
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,480
sort of a show trope.

2001
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,720
WestPain loves Rust, that's why we love Rust.

2002
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:36,960
Yeah, maybe a little bit, plus, like, we kind of get to pick up on some of the legitimate

2003
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,320
enthusiasm out there for, you know, devs who are just finding and falling in love with

2004
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,320
Rust.

2005
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,880
When's the last time you've seen something like this, where, like, a language like this

2006
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,640
wins the hearts and minds of developers like this?

2007
01:06:46,640 --> 01:07:06,360
Michael Dominic would tell you Objective C, but I don't know if I believe him.
