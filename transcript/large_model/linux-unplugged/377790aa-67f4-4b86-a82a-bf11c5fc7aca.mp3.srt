1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
Sounds like you managed to have yourself

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,300
an actual positive experience with Anaconda.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,620
That makes at least one of us, I think.

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,460
Yeah, all right.

5
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,900
Well, I wanted to play with GNOME 42,

6
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,460
and I thought, why not try it on the upcoming Fedora 36?

7
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,460
So I grabbed a nightly, went to go install it,

8
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,300
and, well, it started with a less than positive experience.

9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,940
I didn't have a mouse cursor.

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,780
Oh.

11
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,060
Yeah, so that was daunting at first.

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,820
My positive note is, turns out,

13
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,500
Anaconda works all right without a mouse.

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,340
Hey, there's that.

15
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,100
I got to say, though, the disk partitioner,

16
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,460
when you've got a lot of disks in your system,

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,820
and you're trying to put your home drive over here,

18
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,140
and your VAR over there, I mean, Wes,

19
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,780
let's just say I'm still restoring data.

20
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,300
It went real bad.

21
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,300
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

22
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,860
My name is Chris.

23
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,700
My name is Wes.

24
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,700
And my name is Bren.

25
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,100
Hello, guys.

26
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:00,940
Great to have you here.

27
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,920
Coming up on the show today,

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,300
we have a game changer release of GNOME just on the horizon,

29
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,340
around the corner, as they say.

30
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,060
We're going hands-on with GNOME 42.

31
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,660
We're going to report what's new,

32
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,700
and what we are so damn excited about.

33
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,420
Plus, the first official alpha

34
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,200
of Asahi Linux's M1 installer is out,

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,140
and we're going to try and get that installed

36
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,060
on a MacBook live during the show.

37
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,580
How you feeling, Wes Payne?

38
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,460
Ooh, I'm excited.

39
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,620
I've been looking forward to this for a long time.

40
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,020
Now, picture it, audience.

41
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,860
Wes is here.

42
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,620
He's got his ThinkPad in front of him.

43
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,020
And then off to the side, he's got a card table,

44
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,500
you know, like something you might maybe eat,

45
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,740
like a microwave meal in front of the TV.

46
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,780
I was hoping there was going to be some sort of food here,

47
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,500
but no, no, instead it's a very beefy MacBook.

48
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,820
Yeah, so this is the other thing right now,

49
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,620
is this is all really new.

50
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,280
So I just got this sucker updated

51
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,860
because it'd been neglected for a little bit.

52
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,100
So it just got all updated.

53
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,580
You got to have like the latest Mac OS on there.

54
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,580
And they got a shell script you can run.

55
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,260
Got all that sorted, but I've never really seen anyone

56
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,020
say they have this running on a MacBook Max.

57
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,900
I see a lot of M1 errors.

58
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,060
I believe the dev team has it running on their minis,

59
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,980
but I've seen nobody that's crazy enough

60
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,860
to put it on the MacBook Max.

61
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,700
So this may blow up in our faces.

62
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,660
I'd like to be clear.

63
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,780
I am not guaranteeing that I'm going to return

64
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,660
a working machine to you.

65
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,100
We'll find out coming up here in a little bit.

66
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,140
But before we get into any of that,

67
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,740
before we get into the booths and the pics and all of that,

68
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,780
I got to say time appropriate greetings

69
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,660
to our virtual lug.

70
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,580
Hello, Mumba Room.

71
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,400
Hello.

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,240
Hello.

73
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,180
Hello, Brian.

74
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,540
Man, it's good to see you guys.

75
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,780
Powerful voice today.

76
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,440
I was all out of sorts last week.

77
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,740
Didn't even introduce the Mumba Room

78
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,700
because we only had like five, six people in there.

79
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,860
It was weird because of the daylight savings.

80
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,740
And I thought maybe the show was dead.

81
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,580
I wasn't sure.

82
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,120
But then now we've got 25 people in there.

83
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,980
So it's fantastic.

84
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,560
Thank you, everybody, for making it on a Sunday.

85
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,020
We love having you here.

86
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,780
Yeah, you guys.

87
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,940
Good looking bunch too.

88
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,100
All right.

89
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,920
Should we do it?

90
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,960
You want to like officially kick it off?

91
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,220
Because I got a few things I could get into.

92
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,300
I got to buy you some time.

93
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,140
You do got to.

94
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,960
I mean, yeah.

95
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,460
We've got like things to download.

96
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,780
Do you want to officially kick it off?

97
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,340
Now you do have 53 gigs of free space, right?

98
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,860
Um, I think I should.

99
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,700
I don't know.

100
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,780
You tell me, what does it say?

101
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,500
Does it tell you how much I have on there?

102
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,180
Can you do a DF on the Mac?

103
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,400
Is that a thing you can do?

104
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,240
What does it say?

105
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,980
Yeah, 1.3 terabytes.

106
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,300
Does that sound right?

107
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,780
All right, Westpain.

108
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,900
Let's do this.

109
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,280
You get it started.

110
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,300
I'm going to give you time.

111
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,380
I got a few things to talk about.

112
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,020
We got things to get into.

113
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,300
So you kick it off.

114
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,660
You give me the flag if you got any problems

115
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,980
or when you get to a major milestone

116
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,820
and we'll do a check-in.

117
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,700
You know, you'll be happy to know

118
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,120
the first step here recommends me

119
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,900
curling something and piping it to SH.

120
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,900
So thanks for handing me your very expensive laptop.

121
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,940
And don't worry.

122
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,300
I just did a pseudo dash S so you can go to town.

123
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,740
Because that's how we're going to get it.

124
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,260
All right, we'll check back in in a few minutes.

125
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,180
We are just a couple of weeks away

126
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,980
from our meetup on the East Coast

127
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,260
in Raleigh, North Carolina on April 9th.

128
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,100
There is a lot of people coming, Brent.

129
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,060
Have you, Brent, have you seen these numbers?

130
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,900
Have you?

131
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,740
Yeah.

132
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,460
I think we're like at 60 on the meetup now.

133
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,300
It's just going up and up.

134
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,860
I had a look and I browsed through all the names

135
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,820
and I just kept smiling,

136
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,020
but mostly because usually if there's like 60 there,

137
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,420
then there's even more that show up.

138
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,820
So I think it's going to be real exciting.

139
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,380
Yeah, I think we might have like a hundred people

140
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,220
or something.

141
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,880
I think it's going to be pretty big.

142
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,260
And I've heard from people that can't make it too.

143
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,700
We'll always try to do more meetups too,

144
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,980
but maybe you can.

145
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,540
We'd love to see you there on April 9th.

146
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,380
We're going to be at a park.

147
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,540
It's going to be outdoors.

148
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,700
It's a beautiful time of the year to be in North Carolina.

149
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,060
And this is just outside of Raleigh at a park

150
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,340
that has a barbecue on one end

151
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,660
and a brewery on another end.

152
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,700
And I don't think there's ever been

153
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,660
a more perfect meetup spot.

154
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,500
I encourage someone too to bring their drone

155
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,580
because last time we did a meetup in a park,

156
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,780
we got a great drone group photo.

157
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,260
So if anybody wants to do some drone photography,

158
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,100
this is my hint.

159
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,940
Bring it with you.

160
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,760
I think that'd be fun.

161
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,900
If you can make it, let us know.

162
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,580
We try to give the barbecue place

163
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,820
and the brewery a heads up.

164
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,060
We really at this point don't know what to tell them.

165
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,320
So we're going to have to go by that meetup number.

166
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,980
So you could join the meetup.

167
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,700
I know it's a panel, but it's another account.

168
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,060
But if you could join the meetup,

169
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,380
then we could give the barbecue place

170
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,500
an accurate number of the amount of cows

171
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,900
they got to bring in.

172
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,780
So let us know, meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

173
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,780
I guess, Brent, we'll be able to deduct your cow quantity.

174
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,900
Yeah, I'll donate mine.

175
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,740
That's fine.

176
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,820
That's really nice of you.

177
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,240
So really our only story this week

178
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,900
is that the Asahi Linux Alpha is here.

179
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,100
And keep in mind, this is an Alpha, okay?

180
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,540
Don't put this on your fancy expensive Mac yet.

181
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,100
One of the big missing things amongst a few others

182
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,000
is there's no GPU acceleration at this point.

183
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,860
However, Asahi Linux comes with a customized remix of Arch

184
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,940
that has the full plasma desktop

185
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,180
that is actually pretty decent

186
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,660
with CPU accelerated graphics.

187
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,740
So we're going to go with that.

188
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,740
We're going to use plasma.

189
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,440
I'm new sizing your APFS partitions right now.

190
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,380
Whoa, really?

191
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,500
Yeah, right here it just prompts you.

192
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,380
It's pretty nice too.

193
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,940
Like it lets you, I can specify,

194
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,840
you can just specify like how big you want to make it

195
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,980
or you can even put a percentage.

196
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,060
So I could just say like,

197
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,220
hey, we're going to leave 90% to the Mac

198
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,660
and then slice off 10% for Asahi.

199
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,980
And it seems like their strategy

200
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,900
is to make this a dual boot thing.

201
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,220
Like I think Hector, the main person behind the project,

202
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,280
I think Hector even kind of frames it as,

203
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,860
you can do a boot and you can still watch Netflix and 4K

204
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,740
and update your firmware via the Mac,

205
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,380
use your file vault encryption,

206
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,380
keep all of your secret stuff on the Mac that you need.

207
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,700
And then you can also put into Linux

208
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,820
and have a full environment over there.

209
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,960
And so they're really designing this as a dual boot thing.

210
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,800
Yeah.

211
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,620
And now if you're like,

212
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,980
I really just want to run Linux on here,

213
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,260
they do have a min options,

214
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,580
which just tries to like safely reduce the install of Mac OS

215
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,740
down to the smallest size.

216
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,980
Minimum viable Mac.

217
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,820
Yeah, exactly.

218
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,720
You know where that'd be perfect?

219
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,040
Is I actually see myself using this,

220
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,460
not so much on the laptop end,

221
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,400
but on a Mac mini running headless as a server.

222
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,580
Sure.

223
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,320
If they could get GPU acceleration working on a Mac mini,

224
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,600
and then I could run things like Jellyfin or Plex

225
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,860
and get GPU accelerated decoding of video,

226
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,300
maybe even using the built-in H264 decoders in the M1,

227
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,380
and you're looking at 20 Watts of power,

228
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,480
I could probably quintuple the load of work

229
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,380
that I have the machine doing

230
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,300
for my Raspberry Pis right now.

231
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,700
I could still run Linux.

232
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,440
And if I could get that hardware accelerated decoding,

233
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,640
that'd be pretty powerful.

234
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,740
It'd be really, and plus with Thunderbolt on there,

235
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,400
you could hook up a large external array

236
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,800
of solid state disks.

237
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,300
Not like with the Raspberry Pi right now,

238
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,180
I'm limited to USB.

239
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,480
I could really see this taking a home server setup,

240
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,520
running Linux to the next level,

241
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,080
especially if you're power conscious like I am,

242
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,960
because I'm trying to run everything off solar.

243
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,160
And so the difference between 60 Watts,

244
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,680
20 Watts or 130 Watts is huge for my family.

245
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,480
It's like the difference between being able

246
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,240
to run an appliance for dinner and not.

247
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Especially since you've kind of already got over the hurdle.

248
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,480
Now obviously there's differences,

249
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,200
but you've already got over some of the hurdle

250
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,880
of adapting your workflow to supporting an ARM platform.

251
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,400
Exactly, I don't have to worry about that.

252
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,520
Yeah, so I want hardware acceleration,

253
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,880
but I actually don't necessarily want it for the GUI.

254
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,320
Although of course I would use that on occasion,

255
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,600
but my actual use case would be the home server setup.

256
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,720
You just want the GPU supported

257
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,040
so you can offload stuff to it.

258
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,360
Yeah, my bet though is the CPU might be fast enough

259
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,440
that I could probably get away with software decoding

260
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,880
and not really notice

261
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,440
because I'd be coming from a Raspberry Pi.

262
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,720
Right.

263
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,320
So it really kind of depends on how viable it is.

264
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,520
Oh no, process execution failed.

265
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,240
Uh-oh, what happened over there, what happened?

266
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,080
Red alert.

267
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,920
Red alert.

268
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,240
What does it tell you Wes, what does it say?

269
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,960
Failed to run process disk util apfs resize container,

270
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,080
process execution failed.

271
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,840
Oh, Python stack trace, turn non-zero exit status.

272
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
So it failed during the actual resize?

273
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,680
Let's try it again.

274
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,680
That sort of seems worst case scenario, doesn't it?

275
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,520
You know?

276
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,340
I mean, maybe.

277
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,180
You failed during the disk.

278
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,640
APFS can handle it, it's a robust file system.

279
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,160
Is it getting warm in here or is it just me?

280
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,280
Last time I didn't enable expert mode,

281
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,520
maybe I should this time.

282
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,260
Wes, if anybody should be enabling expert mode,

283
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,680
it is you, what are you doing?

284
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,280
Someone who's never used an M1 Mac before.

285
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,840
Yeah, but you learn quick.

286
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,520
You all right?

287
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,720
I mean, come on, have some confidence.

288
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,600
Brent, you gotta uptalk your boy here.

289
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,400
He doesn't have enough confidence in himself.

290
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,520
Yeah, I know, he's got this.

291
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,320
It seems like if anyone can pull it off,

292
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,440
it's definitely Wes, it's certainly not me.

293
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,760
So Wes, you got this, expert mode all the way.

294
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,400
Yeah, and if you don't get it working,

295
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,240
we're all just gonna be extremely disappointed in you.

296
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,680
Yeah, we'll have to redo the show, but that's fine.

297
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,920
Yeah, you don't wanna wreck the show, right, Wes?

298
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,600
No, no.

299
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,640
Note, your system may appear to freeze during the resize.

300
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,800
This is normal.

301
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Just wait until the process completes.

302
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,000
That's a nice warning.

303
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,720
What is this, some single threaded bull crap?

304
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,600
What is that?

305
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,740
Okay, so you could do the minimal,

306
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,180
which is still gonna be based on Arch.

307
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,820
It's gonna shrink the Mac install down

308
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,940
to just the minimal viable Mac size,

309
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,740
and then use the rest for Linux.

310
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,580
That's pretty nice.

311
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,980
And you know, a lot of the secret sauce in here

312
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,300
is their mini bootloader stuff that they've been working on.

313
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,740
They've been also really good about updating documentation.

314
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,460
They actually had a big, something that Wes noticed,

315
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,180
so they had a big documentation push

316
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,580
right before this alpha release.

317
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,580
That's kinda how we knew this was coming, really.

318
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,140
And the Asahi Linux team has been doing

319
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,940
has been just absolutely stellar

320
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,140
about getting this code upstream.

321
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,220
The idea is, is that eventually,

322
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,860
support for this stuff just comes baked into Linux.

323
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,080
So once we're a few years down the road,

324
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,860
it'll be normalized and gobbled up by most distros,

325
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,620
and you won't even have to worry if that distro has support.

326
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,100
It'll just be built into the kernel.

327
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,940
Wouldn't that be something?

328
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,780
Yeah.

329
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,620
Now, how's it going over there?

330
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,340
Well, we're trying to resize again.

331
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,600
Mm-hmm.

332
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,440
But?

333
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,260
I feel like there's a button up.

334
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,100
I know, I don't know.

335
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,920
Oh, all right.

336
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,760
I mean, it's just doing its business.

337
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,740
We're at 15%, but that's where it was at before, so.

338
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,620
Is that where it failed before?

339
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,460
Man.

340
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,120
I could try giving it less space.

341
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,260
I mean, how much space did you give it?

342
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,580
150 gigs.

343
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,420
Oh, that seems plenty.

344
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,620
No, less space?

345
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,220
What are you, what are you, an animal?

346
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,060
Here's what I'm gonna do.

347
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,900
I'll buy you some time.

348
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,480
Lino.com slash unplugged.

349
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,740
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account,

350
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,620
and you go there to support this here show.

351
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,880
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

352
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,500
You gotta try it for your next project.

353
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,660
It's what we use for anything

354
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,500
that we host up there in the cloud.

355
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,860
Our matrix instance has been growing like crazy,

356
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,640
and this has been a great test

357
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,540
of both Linode's alerting system,

358
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,020
infrastructure, and ability to upgrade.

359
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,060
I mean, I can attest it has really stayed nimble.

360
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,340
We threw it on a $5 system initially,

361
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,020
and it just seemed like that was gonna be fine.

362
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,660
There's only like, you know, a dozen people on there.

363
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,740
Now there's thousands,

364
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,820
and we have scaled that system up using Linode's tools,

365
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,180
and we've been able to use their dashboard

366
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,540
to see what the CPU is,

367
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,940
and what the memory's at, and the disk space,

368
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,040
because they really do a good job

369
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,500
of quantifying those essential metrics

370
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,340
in a really easy-to-read dashboard.

371
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,820
Just pop it right on there when you go to Linode,

372
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,900
and you get an overview of what the system's doing.

373
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,280
And of course, they have tools

374
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,720
to just enable monitoring and managing that thing.

375
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,980
So even though we don't have a big team here,

376
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,380
we can keep something that's kind of expanding

377
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,940
at a pretty rapid clip under control.

378
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,620
And now that Linode has been rolling out

379
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,420
MVME storage on their rigs,

380
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,080
things have just taken a whole new leap in speed.

381
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,880
So they are their own ISP,

382
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,540
so they just have the absolute best peering deal possible,

383
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,380
because they're dealing with themselves.

384
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,780
They got 40 gigabit connections

385
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,700
coming into their individual machines.

386
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,680
They got AMD EPYC CPUs on the high-end CPU systems,

387
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,420
and now they got MVME PCIe storage when you need that.

388
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,180
And you know, maybe you don't.

389
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,700
Maybe you just wanna run like a personal portfolio,

390
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,060
or a blog, or a Minecraft server.

391
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,100
They have systems that are just perfect for that,

392
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,220
and at really great prices.

393
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,700
Linode's 30 to 50% cheaper than the large hyperscalers

394
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,700
that wanna lock you into their crazy complicated platforms.

395
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,420
And they got performance that beats them.

396
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,060
It's just great.

397
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,700
And 11 data centers around the world

398
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,020
means you're gonna have the data centers

399
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,860
where you need them, right?

400
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,860
Like, what do you need more than 11 data centers for?

401
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,420
What are you, a maniac?

402
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,020
What are you?

403
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,860
You Bezos?

404
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,580
Come on, 11 data centers is great.

405
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,180
When they've been doing something like this for 19 years,

406
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,700
you know they're gonna do it, right?

407
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,100
So go see it for yourself.

408
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,100
See why we've been talking about it.

409
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,740
See why we've been using them for two and a half plus years.

410
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,620
And see why so many Linux Unplugged listeners

411
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,780
have been taking advantage of that $100 offer.

412
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,100
Now you can too.

413
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,020
Linode.com slash unplugged.

414
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:43,020
Okay, I saw some exasperation over there, Wes Payne.

415
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,620
Failed again.

416
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,420
I wonder if it's like,

417
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,980
because we just recently did an update.

418
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,420
Could like another round of reboots, maybe?

419
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,260
That's not a bad idea.

420
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,220
We could, I mean, I'm down for that.

421
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,940
If you wanna do that, we could do a round of reboots.

422
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,980
That's fine.

423
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,220
You know, there is a lesson in all of this though.

424
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,460
When this announcement came out,

425
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,100
when Asahi Linux announced their availability,

426
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,780
I really had to have a think if I even wanted to bother.

427
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,620
Yeah.

428
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,980
I realized it sort of is akin

429
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,380
to putting Windows on the deck.

430
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,220
It just, like it can be done.

431
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,300
This is what the audience has been trying

432
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,140
to tell me for a while.

433
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,580
It took me a little bit to realize it,

434
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,340
but like, there's better ways to run Linux out there.

435
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,700
This is not, I don't think the advice of this show

436
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,980
is ever gonna be go buy a MacBook and put Linux on it.

437
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,900
I think that's just ridiculous.

438
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,620
I mean, I think this is the closest we've come

439
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,020
to maybe that changing, but you're right.

440
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,260
Before, that's kind of always been experimental,

441
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,220
or if you have one that's three or four years old,

442
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,420
then maybe it works decently.

443
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,620
The thing that I find pretty interesting

444
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,900
is there has been a couple of changes

445
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,940
that have happened in macOS 12.3

446
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,460
that have specifically enabled Asahi Linux

447
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,340
to work better on the MacBooks.

448
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,460
Two different changes happened recently.

449
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,820
And the only reason that Hector and the team

450
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,220
can even conceive that they happened

451
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,500
is to enable Asahi Linux.

452
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,780
There's like specific improvements for Asahi.

453
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,620
What do you make of that?

454
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,580
What are your thoughts on that?

455
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,460
You know what my theory is, and I'll explain it,

456
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,260
but what is your theory?

457
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,420
Well, I hadn't seen those comments by Hector,

458
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,020
so I can't comment on that part.

459
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,180
I mean, it does seem like there's some efforts internally

460
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,540
to make a consistent ecosystem

461
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,820
that does support other operating systems booting.

462
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,260
It does seem like there's been multiple avenues

463
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,020
where things could be locked down,

464
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,220
they didn't need to be locked down,

465
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,460
but knowing Apple, and if you compare it to, say,

466
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,860
their mobile platforms,

467
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,940
places where it would have seen some restrictions

468
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,060
that just haven't, and then above and beyond that,

469
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,860
some work on some of this tooling,

470
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,940
making things easier than it might necessarily have to be

471
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,660
to just tie up loose ends, make it play nicely

472
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,540
with the existing macOS that's gonna be there.

473
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,300
The other thing that they did, they being Apple,

474
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,420
that I just didn't see coming

475
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,140
when they announced their own hardware platform,

476
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,500
is a lot of the essential bring up

477
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,380
that you traditionally would need a binary blob for in Linux

478
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,860
to get that piece of hardware working.

479
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,220
That's being done at the firmware level,

480
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,740
and then it's presenting itself to the OS is ready to go.

481
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,980
And macOS isn't loading these weird proprietary blobs,

482
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,100
like they even did on the Intel systems,

483
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,940
even though they could more easily now than ever

484
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,100
offload that work to the OS because they write the OS

485
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,180
and the OS is only designed for their own hardware,

486
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,020
they could have had that firmware blob stuff

487
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,860
being done in the OS,

488
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,860
and they chose to do it at the hardware level,

489
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,940
and so that stuff is available and ready to go for Linux,

490
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,540
and Linux doesn't have to have those binary blobs.

491
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,140
Right, we have to figure out how to interact

492
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,100
with their proprietary hardware,

493
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,660
but it's interesting, like it's a different level

494
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,180
of communication and interfacing,

495
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,580
and so far it seems like it's kind of a new paradigm

496
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,380
for supporting Linux on an ecosystem

497
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,860
that is neutral at best to us being there.

498
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,540
Yeah, I actually think they want it there.

499
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,020
That's my theory, so my conspiracy bacon on this

500
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,900
is that they actually want Linux on the M1

501
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,540
and future hardware because once they start shipping

502
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,620
M2-based Macs and all that kind of stuff,

503
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,060
you know, once they work the M2 through the line,

504
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,420
they're not gonna stop building M1s.

505
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,300
They're gonna build their own custom M1-based servers

506
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,940
for their iCloud data center.

507
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,100
You know, racks and racks of M1s just on the shelf,

508
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,060
purpose-built for a data center,

509
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,780
and they're gonna need Linux on those things.

510
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,780
They're not gonna wanna run,

511
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,660
they're not gonna wanna run Mac OS on 5,000 M1 servers.

512
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,780
That's ridiculous, right?

513
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,100
And when you think about what iCloud is mostly composed of,

514
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,900
it's composed of database backends, object storage,

515
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,820
NGINX, right, standard stuff that runs on Linux.

516
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,220
They're not running iCloud on Mac OS,

517
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,340
and why wouldn't they want to use the M1 hardware

518
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,980
that has a built-in neural engine that uses less power

519
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,900
so they could save money at their data center,

520
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,300
it's less cooling.

521
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,180
You think about the economics of an M1

522
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,020
when you're dealing with 5,000 of them.

523
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,580
I mean, we know they love dogfooding when they can.

524
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,500
So I guess, I have to imagine internally,

525
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,340
the engineers have been making small, low-level tweaks

526
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,140
to make Linux more available,

527
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,900
or to make the M1 more available to Linux.

528
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,020
It's been my theory.

529
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,340
We'll see, because we're having trouble

530
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,900
even getting the disk resized at this point.

531
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,180
You could see it also just helping their own,

532
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,060
you know, yeah, they can get internal builds of things.

533
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,020
Maybe it makes it a little easier

534
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,220
to sort of try out experimental Mac builds

535
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,980
or, you know, other diagnostic setups

536
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,660
that you might be running to try out new hardware.

537
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,460
Yeah, yeah.

538
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,900
But let's say you want to avoid all that,

539
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,100
and maybe you just want to get a good old open x86 system

540
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,180
and throw GNU slash Linux on there,

541
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,700
and you want the top-tier Linux desktop experience.

542
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,820
You want the best of the best.

543
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,980
That, my friends-

544
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,220
XFCE.

545
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:47,860
All right, good night, everybody, that's it, and we're out.

546
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:53,060
No, I have to say, the GNOME 42 release is looking fantastic,

547
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,860
and since LAN kicked off,

548
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,500
we have been running it a couple of days before then,

549
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,660
and we're running it now,

550
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,620
and Wes has got it on his ThinkPad.

551
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,100
I've got it on my ThinkPad.

552
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,460
We'll talk about Brent's setup here in a moment.

553
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,220
We're both running it right here in front of us right now,

554
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,860
and we're excited to tell you all about it,

555
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,340
so keep in mind, it is not out yet.

556
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,300
The way we worded it in LAN was horrible.

557
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,500
I want to just eat that humble pie right here.

558
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,140
I apologize.

559
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,740
The release day is March 23rd, officially for GNOME 42,

560
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,220
but realistically, if you're listening to this at home,

561
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,460
you're going to get it in a distro.

562
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,180
That's how you're going to hear about it or use it.

563
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,380
That's how you're going to see it, right?

564
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,660
It's going to be like, that'll be one of the headline features

565
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,460
of Ubuntu 2204 and Fedora 36 is GNOME 42.

566
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,340
That's really where you're going to hear about it,

567
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,700
but you could actually get your hands on it early,

568
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,860
various means like GNOME OS and Fedora 36, et cetera, et cetera.

569
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,540
And it's here.

570
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,700
It's glorious, and it is the GNOME release

571
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,260
that we've been hoping would land since GNOME 40.

572
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,900
Big things are in this one.

573
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,500
A lot of apps have made the transition to GTK4,

574
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,540
which has a lot of underlying improvements.

575
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,980
But the other big thing here is this actually ships.

576
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,980
Is it Adwaitia?

577
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,700
Is that how we're saying it, LibAdwaitia?

578
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,220
Which there was a lot of controversy about, or maybe

579
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,140
misunderstanding is probably the way to put it.

580
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,020
A lot of misunderstandings about originally,

581
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,300
and we're seeing the fruits of that work now land in 42.

582
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,460
We're seeing a global dark theme that is actually

583
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,060
supported by upstream GNOME.

584
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,740
All of that lands here.

585
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:29,540
And it truly makes for a remarkable version of GNOME.

586
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,100
40 was a big one.

587
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,380
42 is arguably just as big, if not bigger, in my opinion.

588
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,060
And so of course, I'm very, very comfortable and familiar

589
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,980
with GNOME.

590
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,620
So Brent, I know this is one of your first experiences

591
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,220
with GNOME.

592
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,540
You're a plasma guy.

593
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,060
So I'm curious what your GNOME 42 experience was,

594
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,820
because we sort of just threw you in the deep end.

595
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,580
I got to say, it looked beautiful.

596
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,060
I didn't expect how gorgeous it was,

597
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,860
and maybe that sounds a little silly.

598
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,060
But the thing that really hit me was the dark mode.

599
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,180
And I know there's been a lot of work going on behind the scenes

600
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,980
almost for years about this.

601
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,140
And it just worked flawlessly.

602
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,300
I would imagine, Chris, that was one of the first things

603
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,580
you changed as well.

604
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,900
Yeah, I had to try it.

605
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,180
You know what?

606
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,540
Much like Breeze recently, though,

607
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,340
the recent improvements to the theme are so great,

608
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,980
I decided to stick with the light mode.

609
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,820
What?

610
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,580
I don't even know you anymore.

611
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,220
I know.

612
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,980
I'm going to have to pull the dark theme off of the website.

613
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,780
It's a new era.

614
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,700
I'm going to have to implement that standard.

615
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,400
This is actually one of the great things

616
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,820
about using dark mode now in GNOME 42 is the websites that

617
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,220
support this standard will also detect if you have dark mode

618
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:41,940
or light mode.

619
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,020
And it's just so slick.

620
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,580
It's so slick.

621
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,300
It's so slick.

622
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,060
So if you want, you change it in GNOME Appearance

623
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,140
to either light or dark.

624
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,620
And then a lot of websites now just automatically detect it.

625
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,300
Anyways.

626
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,780
I mean, I think that's one of the things

627
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,140
about the recent releases of GNOME,

628
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,460
and particularly this one, that it just

629
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,500
feels like a first class environment because it's

630
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,500
something that you might be used to or have seen

631
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,480
on other platforms.

632
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,060
And the more of those that land on the Linux side of the fence,

633
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,820
it just means people won't be complaining or missing

634
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,900
those features when they come on over.

635
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,060
Another thing, Chris, you suggested that I play with,

636
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,680
since you knew I was a deep KDE user, was the extensions.

637
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,940
And I had a deep hesitation there.

638
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,740
And you seemed really excited about it and suggested a few.

639
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,500
But my hesitation was that it felt as though extensions,

640
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,140
if they were needed to get a desktop running, that

641
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,300
was helpful, that maybe there was something missing

642
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,280
in kind of the vanilla offering.

643
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,580
I think Brent's been listening to Michael Dominic again.

644
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,940
Oh, no.

645
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,340
Yeah, this is definitely a soapbox of Michael Dominic

646
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:45,900
on Coder Radio.

647
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,460
Is it really?

648
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,500
This is definitely.

649
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,980
Yeah, well, this is actually kind of a sensitive issue.

650
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,460
This is kind of a touchy topic, I feel like.

651
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,020
And it's one that the GNOME community is still kind of

652
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,980
sorting out, in my opinion.

653
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,900
That's just my opinion.

654
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,540
Well, it's kind of a different way to do extensions, too.

655
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,660
There's not like a tight-knit extensions

656
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,660
API that provides this set of capabilities.

657
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,060
It's sort of like, well, you can do a lot

658
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,340
with these GNOME extensions.

659
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,100
And that means sometimes they do too much or are written poorly

660
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,820
and can therefore impact the stability of the system.

661
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,140
But they can also transform the desktop in a way

662
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,100
that you don't always see on other platforms.

663
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,500
It's pretty common to say you install four or five

664
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:21,980
extensions.

665
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,780
It's pretty common for one of them just to not even work.

666
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,580
That's not too unusual.

667
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,900
We all know of one that I tried that didn't work,

668
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,180
so I just had to disable it.

669
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,540
We were talking about it this morning.

670
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,340
And that happens, and that's not a great experience.

671
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,860
But Brent, I think your core argument or question

672
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,660
is one that a lot of people raise is,

673
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,540
should I even need to add this stuff,

674
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,900
or should I even add this stuff?

675
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,220
And I think that's a decision that ultimately each user has

676
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,140
to make.

677
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,060
And ultimately, I'm grateful that we still have the choice.

678
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,500
I think that's where I fall on it.

679
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,540
I think I kind of agree with you.

680
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,960
Now, since we're talking about it,

681
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,580
it reminds me of extensions, say, in Firefox.

682
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,340
And it's much the same.

683
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,740
There are a few that I can't live without

684
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,460
and that are amazing and that need to kind of earn your trust

685
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,220
from using it for a bit.

686
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,660
And the one you suggested that I install right away

687
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,540
was the app indicator support.

688
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,500
And that actually did make me feel right at home.

689
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,260
So thank you.

690
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,220
And I think I would need that to use GNOME 42.

691
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,700
And it seemed well supported and well used.

692
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,960
I kind of scrolled through the list of other extensions.

693
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,940
And some of them felt, hmm, suspect maybe.

694
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,300
There were some that were trying to, anyways.

695
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,700
There were some that just, my red flag bells ringing

696
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,820
sort of kept coming off, and there was no way

697
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,900
I was going to install those.

698
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,980
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

699
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,460
Yeah, I'd follow you on that.

700
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,580
I'd say for someone who's, I consider myself adventurous,

701
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,660
but also cautious.

702
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,100
So I'd say just kind of do some reading

703
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,420
and maybe play with them on a system that's not

704
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,100
your production machine at first.

705
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,100
Altair, you just made a great point in the IRC.

706
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,260
And that is, it's sort of a double-edged sword.

707
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,180
Having no API means that extensions

708
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,780
can kind of do anything, right?

709
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,900
There's no limit, which is not necessarily maybe

710
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,380
a great thing.

711
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,820
Yes, it's like a weird thing because part

712
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,140
of the reasons they're so powerful

713
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,620
is like they can touch anything.

714
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,460
But also, it's damn cool.

715
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,980
If we're like, it's kind of similar to how

716
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,740
the old Firefox extensions used to work,

717
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,820
where they could do amazing things

718
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,020
and all kinds of awesome stuff.

719
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,700
But once they started migrating things over

720
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,700
to web extensions, a lot of the functionality was removed.

721
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,780
And having to maintain an API is a really, really hard thing.

722
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,620
And coming up with the boundaries

723
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,780
and the capabilities of what you're allowing to do

724
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,620
is a very hard thing that requires lots of resources.

725
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,340
That makes sense.

726
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,260
Yeah.

727
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,460
Yeah, and I could see there being some pushback

728
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,740
if there was an effort around that

729
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,300
because this super popular extension would break.

730
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,660
But at the same time, you have to think maybe long term

731
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,180
that would be the best, right, Brent?

732
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,580
Because I think you're kind of coming at this as a plasma

733
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,500
user, where plasmoids are built into the desktop experience

734
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,620
and you can pull down more.

735
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,260
And it sort of feels maybe, is safer the right term?

736
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,500
You know, I was toying with that.

737
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,700
I think at first I felt it was safer.

738
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,080
But then I was like, well, maybe it's just more familiar.

739
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,620
And it felt like it was more integrated as well.

740
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:28,020
Like for instance, the GNOME extensions application

741
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,500
wasn't even installed by default.

742
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,300
So I had to kind of install that stuff

743
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,340
and go browse and find some on the web.

744
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,900
So maybe it was the process that felt a little different

745
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,620
or just that it wasn't familiar.

746
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,980
But Chris, I know you've basically

747
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,820
used extensions on your GNOME desktops for years.

748
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,340
And I wondered how you felt about it in this new version.

749
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,180
I always start with the absolute minimum possible

750
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,940
whenever I do a new GNOME install.

751
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,840
And I just kind of incrementally add the ones

752
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,300
that I'd like to have.

753
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,340
Although I admit I have a low threshold.

754
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,460
Like I like having all my virtual desktops displayed up

755
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,580
in the top bar.

756
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,280
So I have a visual indicator where I'm at.

757
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,740
So I'll turn that kind of stuff on.

758
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,860
So it's kind of a low bar.

759
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,860
But I also find that pretty much consistently

760
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:12,620
with every GNOME release, I have less and less extensions

761
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,740
that I find myself actually installing.

762
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,780
Either they've made some improvement

763
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,620
or I've just learned to kind of adjust my workflow

764
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,800
and we kind of met in the middle.

765
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,240
And that seems to be pretty common.

766
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,980
Like I'll give you, here's an example.

767
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:29,980
I used to install this really handy screenshot extension

768
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,460
that I thought was great.

769
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,300
And I take screenshots all the time

770
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,420
so I can send Wes stuff and bug him during the day.

771
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,840
Like I gotta have a good screenshot tool

772
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,400
so that way I can spam Wes.

773
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,600
And I would install an extension for that

774
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,980
right out of the box every time.

775
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,040
And now in GNOME 42, they have this new screenshot

776
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,420
experience, in my opinion, it's the best

777
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,300
on any modern desktop out there.

778
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,280
It's so clean, it's so quick.

779
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,900
And I think like Spectacle on plasma

780
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,380
is really great for screenshots

781
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,460
and it has a lot of cool power options.

782
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,100
But this is so simple and straightforward and smooth.

783
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,920
Yeah, right.

784
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,940
I mean, the UI is kind of just the right science

785
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,860
without being in the way and video built right in.

786
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,900
That was impressive.

787
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,020
Yeah, that's so great.

788
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,940
And that kind of stuff has just gotten better and better.

789
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,700
Over the years, the other thing that landed

790
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,440
that we used to have to do a little extra setup

791
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,540
that's just now built in is the remote desktop stuff.

792
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,320
We talked about this with GNOME 41

793
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,460
and the bits were there, all the server,

794
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,140
all the backend bits were there,

795
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,580
but the front end UI bits to turn it on weren't there.

796
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:35,080
And this remote desktop setup is a really great experience

797
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,940
because it's taking essentially a Wayland session

798
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,140
and piping it over RDP.

799
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,980
And so you use an RDP client

800
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,480
to connect to your GNOME desktop.

801
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,480
And the GNOME desktop is depending on your RDP client,

802
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,700
extremely responsive in that remote session.

803
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,140
And so I have used this combined with tail scale

804
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,600
as like my go-to remote solution for Dylan's laptop now.

805
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,460
And it's just great.

806
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,300
Oh, really?

807
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,420
That's your go-to, wow.

808
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,600
Yeah, cause he's always on the tail scale network

809
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,620
and you and I figured out how to turn on the RDP stuff

810
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,460
before the bits were exposed and it was too late.

811
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,620
We'd seen everything, so I just got it going.

812
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,180
And now that this is just built in

813
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,460
and you can just check the boxes available to anybody.

814
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,240
So you go in there now to the sharing section

815
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,940
where you maybe in the past would like turn on

816
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,740
a VNC sharing stuff,

817
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,020
but now you can take advantage of RDP,

818
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,780
which is Microsoft's remote desktop protocol.

819
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,740
Fine, I'll give you access.

820
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,020
It's so nice.

821
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,120
And it's just another example of a feature

822
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,120
that I'd never really thought was gonna get integrated.

823
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,700
That's just now built in and it solves that problem

824
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,420
of how am I gonna get remote access

825
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,660
to this desktop session that's on Wayland, right?

826
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,900
Because when we switched to Wayland,

827
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,900
we lost a lot of the remote desktop features of X

828
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,920
and this is bringing it back in kind of a modern way

829
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,740
that you can run on anything.

830
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,140
You can get an RDP client on an iPad, right?

831
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,500
And you can have your GNOME desktop on an iPad now.

832
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,780
It's so great.

833
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,020
Mini Mac, now you've got a question

834
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,420
that has plagued GNOME users for a long time.

835
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,860
Indeed, so what about the SysTray?

836
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,980
Is there still an extension for that?

837
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,180
Because I have some, I don't know, do you have a VPN?

838
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,540
If you have a VPN and you have that VPN icon

839
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,980
in the SysTray that you could just click on it

840
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,040
and then you have a VPN connection.

841
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,340
Or I have a Flameshot, which is a screenshot editor

842
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,460
with a beautiful SysTray and everything.

843
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,940
Is there an extension for that?

844
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,100
There's a couple of SysTray extensions.

845
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,720
If you have an app that still uses that older API,

846
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,060
there are a couple of options.

847
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,740
And the one that we've all been,

848
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,060
I don't know if you tried this one, Wes,

849
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,580
but Brent and I were using the one

850
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,260
that essentially just implements the Plasma Desktop API.

851
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,100
Oh, nice.

852
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,020
Yeah, it works, right?

853
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,340
And thankfully, that extension's already available

854
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,940
for GNOME 42.

855
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,900
There's actually a fair amount that are good to go

856
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,820
before it's even final.

857
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,700
Right, and I think that maybe is one thing you can,

858
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,540
you'll learn a little,

859
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,180
if you spend a little while in the ecosystem,

860
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,580
sort of figuring out what extensions,

861
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,580
A, are more sensitive to being broken,

862
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,420
release to release,

863
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,140
and then also which ones really stay on top of things.

864
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,860
All right, boy, I feel like this Libidwadia topic,

865
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,500
we could really, we could spend a whole episode on,

866
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
but GNOME 42 is the first version

867
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,300
that puts it at the heart of what defines the look.

868
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,500
And it's an updated toolkit that brings just,

869
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,380
I think the final level of polish that I was waiting for.

870
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,140
There was a lot of misunderstanding

871
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,300
about the direction of theming on GNOME.

872
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,180
And during the kind of heat of that moment,

873
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,220
I kind of had the realization that

874
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,580
if GNOME's default look,

875
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,020
the upstream look of GNOME,

876
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,900
was just good enough,

877
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,700
maybe we wouldn't wanna theme anymore.

878
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,860
And as someone who has literally themed

879
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,420
every version of GNOME since two,

880
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,660
and every version of GNOME three,

881
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,980
and I themed GNOME 40,

882
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,940
and I re-themed GNOME 41,

883
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,980
I am here to tell you,

884
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,180
starting with GNOME 42,

885
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,300
I'm going with the default theme from now on.

886
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,660
They've really nailed it.

887
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,700
The default theme is polished.

888
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,420
It's so well done.

889
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,980
And with the global dark mode

890
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:11,060
that is now just supported by the entire project,

891
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,940
there are aspects to the UI

892
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,540
that are more visible and usable

893
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,220
than they were with previous dark mode themes.

894
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,820
It really does make a difference

895
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,380
to have the entire desktop environment supported,

896
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,500
and to have the app start updating to support it.

897
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,620
And we're starting to see a lot of apps in the ecosystem

898
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,620
try to target GTK4 now.

899
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,900
And that combined with Libidwadia and the global dark theme,

900
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,740
it really comes together to a level of polish

901
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,780
that I've never seen before on the Linux desktop

902
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,860
in 20 plus years that I've been using it.

903
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,420
It's a remarkable release for that version alone,

904
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:49,420
so much so that even though you could get Ubuntu 22.04

905
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,700
with the triple buffering patch that we'll talk about

906
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,980
that would probably make it a slightly faster experience,

907
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,540
I still am really suggesting

908
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,660
that perhaps you try Fedora 36 instead

909
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,620
because they're shipping the default theme.

910
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,420
And the default theme is so good

911
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,940
that I don't think you should miss out

912
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,580
on the GNOME 42 experience.

913
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,260
That's my advice now,

914
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,140
is go with Vanilla Gnome because it looks the best.

915
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,060
That's a huge change.

916
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,060
That's a huge change.

917
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,020
Yeah, wow.

918
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,060
I mean, you-

919
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,900
They've nailed it.

920
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,100
That's kind of like one of the first things you would do

921
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,060
is sort of get things looking decent.

922
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,180
It's a huge change.

923
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,180
It's so great.

924
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,580
It really is great to be able to say that now.

925
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,340
We do have some applications that have changed

926
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,260
like G edit's gone.

927
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,260
There's a new text editor.

928
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,980
And Carl, you saw a note about the new terminal app.

929
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,820
I missed that.

930
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,660
What was that?

931
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,460
Yeah, it looks like there's a new GNOME console app

932
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,860
on the Fedora 36 nightly.

933
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,700
It's not installed by default, but it is in the repos.

934
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,300
And from what I'm reading about it online,

935
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,980
this looks to be a simple terminal emulator,

936
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,460
not really to replace GNOME terminal,

937
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,860
just for it's a console app

938
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,380
for people that don't use the terminal that often

939
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,140
is its own description.

940
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,180
It seems really limited.

941
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,780
It doesn't even have a settings that I can find.

942
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,340
But one cool feature that it has is that

943
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,860
when you elevate to root,

944
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,380
the header bar turns a shade of red,

945
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,900
which is pretty neat.

946
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,900
That is console.

947
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,740
Yeah, yeah.

948
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,700
Danger.

949
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,500
Danger, you're in the root zone.

950
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,460
Oh yeah, look at that.

951
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,300
Neat.

952
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,940
Yeah, it's very similar to the feature

953
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,060
that used to be present on SUSE Linux distributions

954
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,980
way back with their customized GNOME 2 and KDE 4,

955
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,820
where if you did privilege escalation,

956
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,540
the terminal app itself changed to indicate very strongly

957
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,100
that you were running as a super user

958
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,140
and you should be careful.

959
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,260
That's a good idea.

960
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,100
That is a good idea.

961
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,500
So I really liked Fedora 36.

962
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,540
And last night or this morning,

963
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,420
RC1 of GNOME 42 landed on my box.

964
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,500
So that's been really nice.

965
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,700
Brent, did you try it on Ubuntu

966
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,860
or did you try it on Fedora?

967
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,620
I tried Fedora, come on.

968
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,460
Try something new.

969
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,500
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

970
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,060
Well, I'm not that familiar with Fedora,

971
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,100
but our last foray into that was a good experience.

972
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,380
So I thought, why not?

973
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,380
Plus you were championing it quite strongly.

974
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,860
So I figured I should go that way.

975
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,820
And yeah, it was flawless.

976
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,740
I didn't have any issues.

977
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,940
I loved it, the whole thing.

978
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,780
Wow.

979
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,620
I know.

980
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,780
Jeez, it's pretty- That's high priority.

981
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,700
This is actually the smoothest Fedora beta I've ever run.

982
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,220
Usually if I run the Fedora raw hide beta stuff

983
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,660
for like more than two weeks,

984
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,220
I usually, something crashes and burns.

985
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,260
So I mean, it may still happen.

986
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,740
Fedora 36 isn't final yet, so I may still get bit,

987
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,980
but there is an argument to be made

988
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,980
to try this on Ubuntu 2204 LTS when it ships

989
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,340
because it was canonical staff

990
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,780
that originally created this

991
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,340
GNOME triple buffering support.

992
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:39,100
And this triple buffering patch is nice

993
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,060
for those of us maybe around Intel GPUs

994
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,580
that are struggling a little bit to keep up

995
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,860
with certain aspects of the GNOME desktop.

996
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,080
And it causes the GPU to bump up

997
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,380
into a higher performance state

998
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,900
during this additional bursty work,

999
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,220
and then kind of scale back down transparently.

1000
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,860
And I guess currently that's not happening.

1001
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,100
And you put this triple buffering patch in there

1002
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,860
and it's a noticeable improvement

1003
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,220
in the smoothness of the interface

1004
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,460
for those of us that are on integrated GPUs.

1005
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,700
I think I saw this mentioned something

1006
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,940
about Raspberry Pi is too,

1007
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,580
if you happen to be trying it on there.

1008
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,060
Hmm, hmm.

1009
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,780
So Canonical's decided they're gonna just go ahead

1010
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,860
and ship it in Ubuntu 2204

1011
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:19,020
because the patch just didn't land in time

1012
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,940
for 42, it seems.

1013
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,500
That's at least my current understanding.

1014
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,100
I'm very sad about this.

1015
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,380
I really, really wanted that to land.

1016
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,740
If it had landed, this truly would be the GNOME release

1017
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,740
that has everything we've been waiting for, right?

1018
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,540
Because even when 40 came along,

1019
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,420
like that was a big update,

1020
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,420
but we were like, okay, well, the transition to GTK4

1021
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,900
and we knew that Libido was in the far off distant future.

1022
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,020
And so it was like, okay, 40 is a big release,

1023
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,860
but there's like more coming.

1024
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,140
And basically everything is in 42

1025
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,940
except for that triple buffering patch.

1026
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,780
So it's like, okay, well,

1027
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,740
now I'm gonna be waiting a little bit for an update,

1028
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,900
but I actually really have no complaints

1029
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,580
performance-wise, so it's not really a big deal.

1030
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,460
Now I'm wondering how to put my own janky build together.

1031
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,300
Jeez.

1032
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,340
I'm a little concerned

1033
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,060
that you're in the recovery environment right now

1034
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,340
on the Mac over there, Wes.

1035
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,500
I take it that the old Asahi Linux install

1036
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,820
has hit yet another bump in the road.

1037
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,180
Yeah, it's not quite going so well yet.

1038
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,220
It is alpha.

1039
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,060
Ugh.

1040
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,780
So why are you in the recovery environment?

1041
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,060
Well, we were having some issues

1042
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,220
shrinking the partitioning

1043
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,860
so that we can make some room for Linux.

1044
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,020
And so I thought,

1045
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,460
maybe if we try it from this environment,

1046
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,300
it might go a little better.

1047
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,060
Of course I can inspect the APFS volume and make sure.

1048
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:30,900
Oh yeah.

1049
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,100
Make sure there's no issues there to start with.

1050
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,940
Do one of them verifies that they do there, right?

1051
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,780
Right.

1052
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,420
Do a verify of the old file system

1053
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,380
and then you could resize it in the Disk Utility app

1054
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,140
and that probably won't lose all my data.

1055
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,180
So that's the way I think.

1056
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,980
I'm not actually sure how to resize it.

1057
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,140
I did copy the command.

1058
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,940
So we'll, you know, one way or another.

1059
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,540
All right, here, I'll buy you a few minutes.

1060
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:53,220
Hey, I got a live stream coming up on March 31st.

1061
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,500
So join me for a live Q&A

1062
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,700
and I'm gonna give away some Satoshis

1063
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,340
to help people set up their Boost wallets

1064
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:03,020
because I really think we have a window of time here.

1065
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,340
And so go grab yourself a new podcast app

1066
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,620
at newpodcastapps.com.

1067
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,620
We recommend the Fountain app.

1068
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,740
Cast-O-Matic on iOS is really great as well

1069
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,820
and BlueWallet's available.

1070
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,580
But I think Fountain is the best experience

1071
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,980
and I wanna help you get started

1072
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,140
by giving away some stats

1073
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,100
that have essentially been sent in by the audience.

1074
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,940
We'll pull them all together

1075
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:24,180
and I'll give out some of them hot Satoshis.

1076
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,940
I hear you're even using Fountain

1077
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,020
for some of your day-to-day podcasts listening.

1078
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,540
I have, yeah, I've switched over now

1079
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,020
because here's what my thinking is,

1080
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,460
is I think we have an opportunity

1081
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,340
to build out a peer-to-peer network

1082
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,980
of Lightning connected Linux users.

1083
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,620
We start by, you know, obviously,

1084
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,900
I have some skin in this game.

1085
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,860
This benefits me,

1086
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,500
but we start by supporting independent media.

1087
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,300
I'm saying the podcast audience, right?

1088
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,420
We build out, okay, so let's just say like,

1089
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,300
let's say the show has tens and tens of thousands,

1090
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:55,220
five tens, maybe six tens of thousands of listeners, right?

1091
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,780
And let's just say in theory,

1092
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,500
I can talk a thousand of you

1093
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,900
into supporting somebody who's been making content

1094
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,500
for you for 15 years.

1095
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,180
And let's say I can get a handful of you

1096
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,180
who see the value in how hard we've been working nonstop

1097
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,340
every single week for 15 years straight.

1098
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,460
And I can convince maybe 2000 people to switch over

1099
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,460
and start getting on the Lightning network

1100
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:18,100
and supporting the shows through value for value and boosts.

1101
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:22,100
So what happens when the next Linux podcaster realizes

1102
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:26,100
that 2000 people who listened to the largest Linux podcast

1103
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,100
are all now wired up to the Lightning network?

1104
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,140
Well, that new Linux podcaster that comes online

1105
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,180
is gonna immediately start also getting boosts.

1106
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,020
They're gonna have a built-in audience already, right?

1107
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,340
So there's an immediate network effect amongst me

1108
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,980
and my friends once they figure it out.

1109
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,500
But then what happens when we've got three,

1110
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,380
5,000 people now on this network

1111
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,820
and the first free software project that we care about

1112
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,300
comes on the network.

1113
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,460
That's 5,000 Linux loving users

1114
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,900
that are already on the network

1115
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,660
and ready to support that project.

1116
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,460
And all they have to do is set up a Lightning node.

1117
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,300
I think it all starts here.

1118
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,420
We have the network effect to generate this.

1119
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,740
Like this is actually something

1120
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,100
the show can move the needle on

1121
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,300
for the first time in what feels like forever now.

1122
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,300
So let's get together,

1123
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,940
join me on the live stream, jblive.tv, March 31st,

1124
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,140
and I'll send out some stats.

1125
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:19,020
I mean, I'm not like Elon Musk over here,

1126
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,380
but I wanna help you get started on this.

1127
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,980
And I recognize that actually getting something

1128
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,340
in that wallet is like the barrier to entry right now.

1129
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,180
It just is.

1130
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,620
And I really believe in this.

1131
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,380
So I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is on this.

1132
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,620
And so just imagine a day

1133
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,340
where this starts to take off, right?

1134
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,660
So go grab a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com,

1135
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,460
get in on the boosts, send the show some boosts.

1136
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,020
Let's start playing with this.

1137
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,460
Also, I think the other thing I wanna do

1138
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,460
during that live stream is I'd love to help anybody

1139
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,740
who's had trouble getting on our matrix server.

1140
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,620
If you've been trying to like get on matrix

1141
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,220
or you've been thinking about setting up matrix

1142
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,340
and joining the Jupiter broadcasting matrix,

1143
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,380
I wanna help you do that during this live stream as well.

1144
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,980
So it's a Q and A, anything goes, ask me anything.

1145
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,260
I'd love to get my friends to come hang out with me guys.

1146
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,660
And also I'm gonna be giving out some stats

1147
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,980
to people who are setting up a new podcast app wallet

1148
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,540
and wanna help do some boosting.

1149
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,580
And last but not least, we'll just hang out and chat

1150
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,460
and maybe get some people on our matrix system as well.

1151
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,620
So it's gonna be 4 p.m. Seattle time,

1152
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,980
7 p.m. New York time, 11 p.m. London,

1153
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,420
March 31st at jblive.tv.

1154
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,580
I'd love to see you there.

1155
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:27,620
We got a little bit of feedback

1156
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,740
and a whole bunch of boosts.

1157
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,600
So first for the feedback, we got a listener asking,

1158
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,060
I'm interested in exploring the Fedora ecosystem

1159
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,020
and I would consider moving my Arch jellyfin Docker

1160
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:41,900
NAS Frankenstein machine to a more stable platform.

1161
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,900
Sounds like they've been listening to us too much.

1162
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,740
Amazing.

1163
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,540
Is CentOS Streams something that one can let run

1164
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,940
with automated updates and get away with monthly updates

1165
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,700
like a big Pac-Man upgrade?

1166
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,940
I think that's a great question.

1167
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,180
It's one that I, of course,

1168
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,820
everybody's gonna have an interpretation on,

1169
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,060
but Neil, you wanna put your name on the line

1170
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,140
and give an official recommendation,

1171
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,180
quote unquote, official.

1172
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,060
As official as unofficial gets?

1173
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,180
Yeah. Sure, yeah.

1174
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,360
Go ahead.

1175
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,860
So I've actually been doing this now for a year.

1176
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:15,780
I've been running CentOS Stream on a couple of boxes

1177
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,220
with DNF automatic configured using Cockpit.

1178
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,100
Like there's, you can activate Cockpit, install it,

1179
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,980
and from within the web UI,

1180
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,420
you can configure automatic updates.

1181
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,580
I have it update every Sunday at 3 a.m.

1182
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,420
and it reboots itself and brings everything back online

1183
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,340
every Sunday, every week without fail,

1184
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,460
no problem at all.

1185
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,900
And it's been doing this since, okay,

1186
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,940
when did I actually set this machine?

1187
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,180
June, late June.

1188
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,860
And nothing's blown up in your face yet?

1189
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,380
No, it's been totally fine.

1190
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,920
It's been phenomenal and the experience is pretty good.

1191
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,340
Like I can't say the same thing about the desktop.

1192
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:53,140
The desktop experience really only solidified in the fall,

1193
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:58,140
but the server experience has been bang up awesome

1194
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,180
pretty much since June.

1195
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:04,380
And I mean, even the new Podman 4.0 is there.

1196
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,860
The Cockpit management of containers through Podman

1197
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,840
is present, Cockpit machines is there.

1198
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,580
So if you wanna, if it's a bare metal server

1199
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,240
and you wanna also manage a mixture of virtual machines

1200
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,940
and containers, that's all present.

1201
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,420
It's super solid, works great.

1202
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:22,380
And I really have no complaints about it.

1203
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,820
Of course, I'm working on CentOS Stream 9 Hyperscale.

1204
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:28,440
And once I've got more of those pieces laid down,

1205
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,700
I plan to migrate that machine to Hyperscale,

1206
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,380
but that's because I like to eat my own dog food

1207
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,160
and I think my stuff is awesome,

1208
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,340
but I've been running vanilla CentOS Stream 9

1209
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,980
for almost a year now and it's been fine.

1210
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,100
All right, that's great.

1211
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,300
I also think it would be more than fine,

1212
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,180
especially he's coming from Arch, right?

1213
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,400
So Fedora would even be like a scale back

1214
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,660
in the terms of changes,

1215
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,600
but I actually think CentOS strikes the right balance there.

1216
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,820
If you think of CentOS Stream 9

1217
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:00,420
as a continuation of the Fedora 34 code stream

1218
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,420
for many more years, then you will be fine.

1219
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,680
Like if you liked what Fedora Linux 34 offered

1220
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,920
from Fedora Workstation 34 minus the Butterfest stuff,

1221
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,380
and having some of the light touch enhancements

1222
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,800
and backports of enhancements and neat things

1223
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,000
that Red Hat and the community have worked on in 35 and in 36

1224
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,380
and you just want a stabilized platform

1225
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,100
with a good balance between feature enhancements

1226
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,640
and stability, then you're gonna have a nice time

1227
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,740
on CentOS Stream 9.

1228
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:35,020
And if you want to, and CentOS Stream 9 is supported

1229
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:38,740
for the quote unquote full support phase

1230
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,460
of the RHEL lifecycle, which is five and a half years.

1231
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,540
That's pretty good, yeah.

1232
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,900
That is, especially for free.

1233
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,660
Right, and once you're past that,

1234
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,420
you could either use Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9

1235
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,740
genuine article to get a full 10 year lifecycle,

1236
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,300
and there'll probably be RHEL rebuilds

1237
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,820
like Alma Linux or whatever that you could use

1238
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,620
if you want to go that route instead.

1239
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,100
Sure, yeah, yeah.

1240
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,100
Now I want to make it clear,

1241
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,700
because he is coming from Arch, Carl,

1242
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,160
we should probably make a little disclaimer

1243
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,380
that he shouldn't expect this to be a rolling distro.

1244
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,860
Right, yeah, we're still seeing misconceptions

1245
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,420
in the community.

1246
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,100
Some of it caused by the own CentOS messaging,

1247
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,300
but CentOS Stream is not a real rolling release.

1248
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,700
Like most people think of it,

1249
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,380
it's gonna stay on the same major version nine,

1250
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,180
and the updates you see are going to be

1251
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,420
the same updates you'd see within a RHEL major version.

1252
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:32,160
So really the big change is that there's no minor versions,

1253
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,760
but you're not gonna wake up one day

1254
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,620
and have RHEL 10 content on there.

1255
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,260
It's still gonna be what you see in RHEL 9,

1256
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,020
and only the kind of updates you'd see

1257
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,680
going from say 9.0 to 9.1

1258
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,620
are the updates you'll see on that system.

1259
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,260
Yeah, yeah, thanks for making that clear.

1260
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,220
I think that's good for people understanding.

1261
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,420
And you'll know when that's coming,

1262
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,840
because we'll be talking about it here on the show,

1263
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,020
so you'll have plenty of a heads up.

1264
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:58,020
And now, as the French say, it is time for Le Boost.

1265
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,800
Samuel Blair wrote in with a boost.

1266
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,140
Been listening for years, already supporting the show,

1267
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,540
but figured I would give this boost thing a try.

1268
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,840
Keep up the good content.

1269
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,420
Slow down a little if you need.

1270
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,500
The community is not going anywhere.

1271
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,400
Aw, well that's nice.

1272
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,340
Pew!

1273
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,860
Six days ago, 5,000 sats, thank you freak.

1274
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,860
Sadly, the lightning system does not work

1275
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,740
with the core contributorship.

1276
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,860
It'd be very cool, for example,

1277
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,420
to get access to an ad-free feed

1278
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,340
at greater than X sats per minute.

1279
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,160
What I'm going to do is play

1280
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,180
with the sats per minute settings

1281
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,160
and the occasional boost to get to around

1282
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,420
10 to $20 per month over all my podcasts that support it.

1283
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,940
Yeah, you know, there's a lot there that,

1284
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,800
A, we're not happy with with our current setup,

1285
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,500
because, well, this stuff's all new

1286
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,020
and not all of the various pieces

1287
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,220
that we've had to bolt together

1288
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,860
to make the membership stuff work supported right now.

1289
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,060
And then also just like, oh, this is kind of new stuff.

1290
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,860
And yeah, you could see a whole SAT powered,

1291
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,940
you know, lightning based membership system, maybe?

1292
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,060
I don't know, what do you think, Brent?

1293
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,580
Yeah, we've had a few people write in

1294
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:03,160
about this very problem, and I think they're totally right.

1295
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,360
Despite it being a little bit of an edge case,

1296
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,420
I think just wait and see.

1297
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,420
Like, this is progress that we're sort of

1298
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,100
in maybe some transitional phases.

1299
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,620
So, I mean, Wes, you've done a ton of work

1300
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,460
on the back end to try to like,

1301
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,380
literally, like you said, bolt things together.

1302
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,140
So, I think it's been working great,

1303
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,340
but there's always progress to be made.

1304
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,020
All right, well, Mollusk sent us a boost saying,

1305
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,780
great show, guys, been listening for over 10 years.

1306
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:34,320
And I'm glad to see you guys in Bryce Podcasting 2.0.

1307
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,680
Keep up the good work.

1308
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,540
Our next one, DG Wolf writes in,

1309
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:40,820
thanks for revisiting Jellyfin, guys.

1310
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,080
I tried it years ago, but it was a little rough.

1311
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,860
But he gave it another go after we talked about it,

1312
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,820
and it's now replacing his Plex server.

1313
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,660
How is that awesome?

1314
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,820
Wow, dang.

1315
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,100
Yeah, from North Carolina, too,

1316
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,700
so hopefully we'll see him at the meetup.

1317
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,540
We'll see him.

1318
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,300
Always good to hear some Jellyfin love, too, you know?

1319
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,800
I mean, it's maybe not for everyone,

1320
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,300
but it's come a long way.

1321
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,580
Scuba Steve, Scuba Steve, who's in the Mumble Room, too,

1322
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,700
so like getting double points today,

1323
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,840
four days ago sent us a boost that said,

1324
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,020
can't wait to see you guys in Raleigh.

1325
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,960
Oh, Scuba, you're gonna be in Raleigh, that's great.

1326
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,800
That's great.

1327
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,140
So, he asked what we think about Substack,

1328
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,660
which is, I think I'm gonna punt this question

1329
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,500
to Koda Radio.

1330
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,580
So, tune into Koda Radio for that one,

1331
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,580
because I think that's gonna be a good discussion

1332
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:23,780
between Mike and I.

1333
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:26,220
Hudson said five days ago,

1334
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,580
you know, the thing about value for value

1335
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,700
is that it gives you skin in the game.

1336
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,660
It incentivizes people to create quality feedback.

1337
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,240
Unlike a YouTube comment,

1338
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,900
if I send you guys 1,000 sats to make a comment,

1339
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,180
I'm gonna make sure it's thoughtful.

1340
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,940
Otherwise, I'm just wasting my money.

1341
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:42,140
Imagine this concept, but throughout all of the internet,

1342
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,240
it may be a potential way to clean up a lot of the junk

1343
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,820
and the noise on the internet.

1344
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,940
I am of a really mixed opinion on this, Hudson.

1345
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,340
I definitely have witnessed what you're saying firsthand.

1346
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,020
And yet, at the same time,

1347
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:00,020
I hate the idea of creating financial barriers

1348
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,660
to participate on the web.

1349
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:06,060
But I guess that's a little of an extreme view.

1350
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,980
That's probably not what would happen, right?

1351
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,100
You'd just get some places

1352
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:13,220
that ask for a little bit of value to participate

1353
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:16,780
to reduce the cost of harassment and spamming.

1354
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:21,660
And I'm watching this play out in real time at stacker.news.

1355
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,980
I mentioned this to you guys a couple of weeks ago.

1356
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:27,460
stacker.news is like Reddit,

1357
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:31,140
but you have sats, there's an incentive system

1358
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:34,740
around quality posts and quality comments.

1359
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,300
They're incentivized by a couple of sats,

1360
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,740
kind of like the boosts are.

1361
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:41,720
And I've been checking this site for about three weeks.

1362
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,420
And what's interesting is,

1363
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:46,340
you could cut out Reddit and Twitter altogether,

1364
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,760
avoid both those dumpster fires.

1365
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,100
And I'd say you'd still get 80% of the value

1366
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,180
without all of this stuff that sets you in right there.

1367
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,100
So it's like, if you're willing to miss out on some things,

1368
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,620
but still get most of the value of Twitter and Reddit,

1369
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,380
stacker.news has been really great.

1370
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:06,380
And I have to think it's because there is an incentive

1371
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,800
for quality content, but even more importantly,

1372
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,700
there's an incentive for high quality comments.

1373
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,980
So it's not just these crappy fights that happen.

1374
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:19,100
It's like people are providing additional source material

1375
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:19,940
and references.

1376
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:22,460
And yeah, that's been really cool.

1377
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,120
Yeah, it seems like it could still be vulnerable

1378
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,940
to sort of group think or other problems,

1379
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,780
higher level problems,

1380
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,620
but maybe you could address some of those lower level,

1381
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,460
just posting that, yeah, is it relevant?

1382
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,460
Or yeah, as you say, is fighting or-

1383
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,300
I think it's a nice social experiment.

1384
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,940
I don't know if I'm ready to see something like that be,

1385
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,240
like the concept be adopted everywhere.

1386
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,820
But I think it is an interesting experiment

1387
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:45,800
to watch a group do and see how it goes.

1388
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,820
That's stacker.news, if you want to check that out.

1389
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,960
I've been kind of following it.

1390
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,460
And I mean, it's definitely Bitcoin heavy

1391
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,280
and lightning heavy,

1392
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,740
but that happens to be things I'm interested in,

1393
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:54,820
but it's not just that stuff.

1394
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,680
It's like the stuff that would normally kind of be

1395
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,900
circulating that's popular and trending,

1396
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,260
but without all of the garbage.

1397
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,140
Anonymous sent us a boost six days ago,

1398
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,460
says it feels very good to be listening to your podcast

1399
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,300
and streaming in and streaming some stats back.

1400
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,980
It's quite literally value for value.

1401
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,580
I love it, and I could see doing it

1402
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:12,580
for free software one day.

1403
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,180
And I completely agree, Anonymous.

1404
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,900
I think that's going to be, that's where I see the shift,

1405
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,900
but we'll see.

1406
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,500
We'll see if we get there.

1407
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,340
It may happen.

1408
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,180
It may not.

1409
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,000
You know what?

1410
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,380
I may just be wasting my breath.

1411
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,220
We shall see.

1412
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:28,660
All right.

1413
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,480
Thank you for boosting everybody.

1414
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,500
But with the boost all boosted,

1415
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,500
Wes Payne, let's do a check-in on that MacBook Max.

1416
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,660
I know you've been in disk utility for the last few minutes.

1417
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,500
How's it going?

1418
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,980
Bad news.

1419
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,820
Uh-oh.

1420
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,420
It seems like you've got some kind of disk corruption

1421
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:43,260
going on here.

1422
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,580
Oh, I like how it's my problem all of a sudden.

1423
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,300
Well, I found it this way.

1424
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,860
At least you think I've already corrupted it somehow.

1425
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,340
I'm surprised you haven't fixed it already.

1426
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,180
That's all.

1427
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,000
That's all.

1428
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,180
Yeah, well, I've rebooted it into the recovery environment,

1429
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,820
running first aid on it from disk utility,

1430
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:59,820
and all I get is this pop-up here with the error sign saying.

1431
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,020
So a file system, now I don't even understand

1432
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,620
how that's possible considering

1433
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:07,020
what if the resizing stuff that failed partway through

1434
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:07,860
with that error caused the error?

1435
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:08,940
It's possible.

1436
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,340
Because this is like a fresh.

1437
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:12,500
It failed because it found an error.

1438
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,060
Oh.

1439
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:14,980
So it probably wasn't that.

1440
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,340
It's probably already existed.

1441
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:19,500
The volume slash dev slash R disk 3 S5

1442
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,900
was found to be corrupt and needs to be repaired.

1443
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,920
Unable to perform declared repairs

1444
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,320
without full space verification.

1445
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,120
Well, it looks like we won't be getting

1446
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,180
Asahi Linux on there today.

1447
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,600
We may just have to nuke and pave the thing.

1448
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,380
I mean, it's pretty fresh install.

1449
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,980
It's like browsers installed.

1450
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,180
There's telegram installed.

1451
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,580
Yeah, I was gonna say how much junk do you have on here?

1452
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:45,860
I mean, it must've been edge.

1453
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:47,180
It must've been putting the Microsoft edge on there.

1454
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,580
I can't trust it.

1455
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,740
It's gotta be it.

1456
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:50,580
That's gotta be what it was.

1457
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,980
But we're gonna put it on Asahi as well.

1458
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:54,060
We just can't get that far.

1459
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:56,700
Yeah, I got a login on my Microsoft account and sync it up.

1460
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,140
All right, well, let's do a couple of picks.

1461
00:52:59,140 --> 00:52:59,980
I don't know.

1462
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:00,800
The whole show's ruined now.

1463
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,220
We gotta redo the whole show now.

1464
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,500
We have two picks for you.

1465
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,620
First one is Fountain.

1466
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,940
That's the podcast app that I like.

1467
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:10,060
Version 0.3.10 just came out this last week.

1468
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,340
And you can now opt to have your boosts public,

1469
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:13,900
if you like, in the Fountain app.

1470
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,100
And the second pick is Antennapod 2.5,

1471
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,700
a really cool release because this one lets you be a cool guy

1472
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,980
with your own Antennapod sync setup.

1473
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:23,800
Really?

1474
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,420
Yeah, using G Potter for Nextcloud, which is a thing.

1475
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,460
You can load that up on your own Nextcloud instance.

1476
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,300
Back up a little bit.

1477
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,780
Uh-huh, G Potter for Nextcloud.

1478
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:32,620
Okay.

1479
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:33,460
It's an app now for Nextcloud.

1480
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,280
Sweet.

1481
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,120
Yeah.

1482
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,460
If you think about it, it's genius

1483
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,580
because then the G Potter folks aren't responsible

1484
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:41,020
for like paying out for massive, massive infrastructure

1485
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:41,860
all the time, right?

1486
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:42,680
Yep.

1487
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,820
And it gives you a backend sync

1488
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,780
that you can self-host on Nextcloud.

1489
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,320
So if you've already got an Nextcloud,

1490
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,900
why not go install the old G Potter app?

1491
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,060
And then you can take Antennapod

1492
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,520
and point that at the G Potter app.

1493
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,620
Are you following me, Wes?

1494
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:57,460
Right, yeah.

1495
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,660
And now you have like a sync backend

1496
00:53:58,660 --> 00:53:59,900
and then you take your mobile app

1497
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,420
and you say, hey, sync over here.

1498
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,660
It's just Antennapod doesn't get enough love on this show

1499
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:07,460
because it's A, a popular app amongst our audience,

1500
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,860
B, a great podcast app, and C, open source.

1501
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:15,940
I just wish that they also supported Boost, you know?

1502
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,780
Why don't you file a PR?

1503
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,040
You're right.

1504
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,780
I should file a PR.

1505
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,240
That's a great idea.

1506
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,780
I have a sense they're probably aware

1507
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,420
of the whole Podcasting2 spec.

1508
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,340
I'm sure.

1509
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,620
I would hope so.

1510
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:30,780
If they're not, they should probably do a little research.

1511
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,860
But we'll have links to both the new Fountain release,

1512
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,220
which is a great looking release too.

1513
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:37,100
I mean, I mentioned Public Boost,

1514
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,580
but there's a bunch of other nice stuff in there.

1515
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,500
One of the other cool things about Fountain

1516
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,060
I'm just gonna mention real quick

1517
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:47,940
is that has the coolest clipping system that you can,

1518
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,180
it'll combine the album art with a waveform

1519
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,260
that it'll auto-generate

1520
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,940
and then you can make a YouTube video out of it

1521
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:55,500
or an MP4 or just an audio file.

1522
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,380
And I really feel like a more popular clip sharing.

1523
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,620
And then it has like a discover tab inside the app

1524
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,620
where you can see other clips that people have made.

1525
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,700
I really feel like that'd be a great way to grow podcasting

1526
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,900
and help people discover good shows

1527
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,820
cause you get a real taste of the flavor, as they say.

1528
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:11,560
Also Fountain is working on transcription,

1529
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,620
which is such a cool feature.

1530
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:15,860
It can transcribe each episode.

1531
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,780
So you can, it'll help do the edit.

1532
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,140
You'll work with the edit too for that,

1533
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,800
which is such a neat feature to take the transcription

1534
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,020
and use it to help cut the clips down and stuff like that.

1535
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,140
I mean, it's pretty cool stuff

1536
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,980
they're building in this app.

1537
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,780
At some point we're gonna be making our podcasts

1538
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,580
in the Fountain, that's what it sounds like.

1539
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,420
I know, right?

1540
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,260
I know, geez.

1541
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,340
Anyways, links to them in the show notes

1542
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:38,200
at linuxunplugged.com slash four five zero.

1543
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,140
Over there you'll also find our contact page.

1544
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:43,120
We'd love to hear from you via the contact page as well.

1545
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,500
And you'll also get, what Wes?

1546
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:49,340
Subscribe links, matrix info, mumble info.

1547
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,180
That's right.

1548
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,140
That's all over there.

1549
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,940
Easy ways to send us email.

1550
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:53,780
Yeah.

1551
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,660
If you wanna send us your pics or your thoughts.

1552
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,580
That's fine, that's fine.

1553
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,220
And of course you're welcome to join us live.

1554
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,460
We do the show on Sundays,

1555
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,540
get together at noon Pacific, three p.m. Eastern.

1556
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,220
jblive.tv.

1557
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,500
See you next week.

1558
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,860
Same bat time, same bat station.

1559
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,220
And of course, don't miss Linux Action News.

1560
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,140
If you're in the industry,

1561
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,980
you gotta catch Linux Action News.

1562
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,100
It's almost a mandate.

1563
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,700
Just not yet, not yet.

1564
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,560
Yeah, you know, Congress can't get anything done.

1565
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,780
No, we're working on it though.

1566
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,280
We got a lobby group.

1567
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,540
We're paying them with Dogecoin.

1568
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:27,140
In the meantime, just go to linuxactionnews.com yourself

1569
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,740
before you're compelled to do it.

1570
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:32,220
And, you know, listen to it.

1571
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,380
That's my worst pitch ever.

1572
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,920
But I think you get the idea.

1573
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,620
Anyways, we just appreciate you listening.

1574
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,500
Nothing else, just thanks.

1575
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,340
You're great.

1576
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:44,020
We really do thank you and everybody out there.

1577
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,100
And we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

1578
00:56:46,100 --> 00:57:06,100
I'm your host, I'm your host, I'm your host, I'm your host.

1579
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:27,860
Last-minute update to the show here, Wes Payne.

1580
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,900
It appears that Antennapod is working

1581
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,980
on value-for-value support.

1582
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,640
We have a PyCrash update with a link to a GitHub issue

1583
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,420
that was opened up on November 8th, 2020.

1584
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,600
And it even includes a diagram

1585
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,100
of how the value-for-value flow model works.

1586
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,380
Look at this.

1587
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:46,260
If you were wondering what the hell we've been talking about

1588
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,460
and you wanted a visual, this is it.

1589
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,740
We'll put a link in the show notes to this.

1590
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,500
And it's exciting to see that Antennapod

1591
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,140
is indeed working on this.

1592
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,020
How about that?

1593
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,340
Yeah, I don't know if it's, right now,

1594
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,460
there's some discussion on the forum.

1595
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,420
Been a little while since there's an update.

1596
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:00,420
I mean, it could happen though.

1597
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,260
It could happen.

1598
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,100
Like we have a thread to tug on now.

1599
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:06,900
But it is, maybe it needs a little bit

1600
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,260
of a demonstration of interest, perhaps.

1601
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,100
That never hurts.

1602
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:10,920
I mean, you know what?

1603
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,220
You build out the network, the bigger the network gets,

1604
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,340
the more everyone's incentive aligns, right?

1605
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:18,340
Like, of course, JB stands to make some money,

1606
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:20,580
but of course, so does every other podcaster

1607
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,340
and so does open source projects

1608
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,860
and pretty soon individuals.

1609
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,060
Like, that's how a network effect works.

1610
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,240
And the more people on the network,

1611
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,900
the more valuable it becomes.

1612
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,300
And why not go with something that's decentralized,

1613
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,360
it's open source, and it's completely sovereign

1614
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,140
so people can self-host their own nodes if they want to.

1615
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,860
Just make it real easy for us to all shoot some payments

1616
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:40,940
for us being cool to each other.

1617
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:41,780
Pew, pew!

1618
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:42,740
I like what you're doing over there.

1619
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:43,780
Yeah, hey, good job.

1620
00:58:43,780 --> 00:59:12,780
Here, here, have some.
