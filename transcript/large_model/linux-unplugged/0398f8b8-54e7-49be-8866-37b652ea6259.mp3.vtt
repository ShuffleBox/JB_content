WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.380
Are you all packed up for our trip?

00:01.380 --> 00:01.960
No, not at all.

00:01.960 --> 00:03.520
But that's going to happen tonight.

00:03.520 --> 00:04.020
Oh, yeah.

00:04.020 --> 00:04.760
So I can say it, too.

00:04.760 --> 00:06.440
Well, I've got to do laundry first.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.280
That's right.

00:07.280 --> 00:09.480
I'm totally going to do it after the show.

00:09.480 --> 00:13.160
Wes and I tomorrow fly out to San Antonio, San Antonio,

00:13.160 --> 00:15.000
Texas for the Texas Cyber Summit.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.680
Before the show, we were both checking in

00:16.680 --> 00:19.840
and realizing neither of us is prepared for this.

00:19.840 --> 00:21.400
What about you, Cheesy, are you packed?

00:21.400 --> 00:22.780
Yeah, I'm pretty much packed up.

00:22.780 --> 00:25.320
I've got a few things to add, some swag to throw

00:25.320 --> 00:26.760
into the back of the vehicle.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.640
But other than that, yeah, I'm ready to go.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.680
Looking forward to hanging out with you guys, obviously.

00:30.680 --> 00:31.160
I know.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.720
That is going to be a lot of fun.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.240
Well, L set us all up with an Airbnb,

00:34.240 --> 00:37.560
so we'll be hanging out at the Airbnb, doing stuff.

00:37.560 --> 00:38.520
That'll be really good.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.880
Feel like it's going to be kind of like Red Hat Summit was,

00:40.880 --> 00:43.080
where we all get to decompress at the end of the day

00:43.080 --> 00:44.320
and kind of rap out for a few.

00:44.320 --> 00:47.400
And like last time, we always get

00:47.400 --> 00:48.940
geeky sitting around talking about Linux

00:48.940 --> 00:50.000
when we get an Airbnb.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.440
That's the greatest thing, to get the geek out in person.

00:52.440 --> 01:00.680
Oh, hey.

01:00.680 --> 01:03.040
Welcome into Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show.

01:03.040 --> 01:03.800
My name is Chris.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.520
My name is Wes.

01:04.520 --> 01:05.600
Hello, Wes.

01:05.600 --> 01:09.360
This is one of those episodes where we got together last week

01:09.360 --> 01:12.080
and we thought, well, let's chat about next week's episode.

01:12.080 --> 01:16.620
And about 10 hours later, we've got something really cool,

01:16.620 --> 01:18.720
but we went down a few rabbit holes.

01:18.720 --> 01:21.160
So hopefully, we'll save you some time

01:21.160 --> 01:25.560
when you're trying to set up an ultimate LAN mesh powered

01:25.560 --> 01:26.320
by WireGuard.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.320
WireGuard, WireGuard.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.080
In fact, we'll talk a little bit about that,

01:29.080 --> 01:30.720
because I think soon you'll be hearing

01:30.720 --> 01:32.160
much more about WireGuard.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.040
Let's hope so.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.440
Yeah, it seems like there's some pieces that

01:34.440 --> 01:37.680
are moving that are going to kick things into high gear.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.320
And it turns out things are a bit more

01:39.320 --> 01:41.320
complex than maybe you might appreciate,

01:41.320 --> 01:42.740
but some things are a little easier.

01:42.740 --> 01:48.480
So we'll get into how I bridged a mobile network with a LAN

01:48.480 --> 01:51.600
network using WireGuard and making

01:51.600 --> 01:53.560
all the devices on each end of the LAN

01:53.560 --> 01:55.280
accessible to each other.

01:55.280 --> 01:58.200
It's really neat, and it's essentially

01:58.200 --> 02:00.720
enterprise-grade networking tech,

02:00.720 --> 02:04.080
like stuff that you used to have to pay Cisco tens of thousands

02:04.080 --> 02:07.040
of dollars to do, and now it's baked right into Linux.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.600
And I don't know, maybe people haven't seen your RV,

02:09.600 --> 02:12.680
but you don't have room for a network rack in there.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.760
So we'll talk so much more about that in a little bit.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.140
Of course, we've got the community news.

02:16.140 --> 02:18.200
There's some good stuff in there to get to.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.880
As well as our virtual log.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.800
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:21.800 --> 02:22.520
Hello.

02:22.520 --> 02:23.400
Hello.

02:23.400 --> 02:27.320
Hi, good to see you, Wimpy, and Minimac, and Bitten,

02:27.320 --> 02:29.440
and Carl, and Bruce.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.360
And I'm going to say, Aknomad?

02:31.360 --> 02:33.020
I can't quite see from across the room.

02:33.020 --> 02:33.440
What is it there?

02:33.440 --> 02:34.520
Read it for me there, Wes.

02:34.520 --> 02:35.360
Wes is closer.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.800
Ace Nomad.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.720
There you go.

02:37.720 --> 02:38.280
That's it.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.040
Hey, you got it.

02:39.040 --> 02:39.520
You got it.

02:39.520 --> 02:39.840
Nice.

02:39.840 --> 02:40.360
Ace Nomad.

02:40.360 --> 02:40.960
Well, welcome in.

02:40.960 --> 02:41.840
Glad to have you here.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.560
And of course, Mr. Bacon's there too.

02:43.560 --> 02:44.200
Hey, Cheesy.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.260
Hey, hey, hey.

02:45.260 --> 02:46.360
What's up, everybody?

02:46.360 --> 02:50.200
Oh, you know, getting ready to fly down to San Antonio.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.480
Looking forward to seeing you.

02:51.480 --> 02:52.360
Hell yeah.

02:52.360 --> 02:55.360
Yeah, I think it's going to be nice to get

02:55.360 --> 02:57.920
a little shift in weather, too, from the Pacific Northwest.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.600
More than a little shift.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.440
Well, let's talk about some community news.

03:02.440 --> 03:07.080
And Linus kicks it off this week after, well,

03:07.080 --> 03:10.080
some not-so-surprising comments about Microsoft, I suppose.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.240
I was going to say somewhat surprising, but if you know

03:12.240 --> 03:15.160
Linus, he's very pragmatic about these kinds of things.

03:15.160 --> 03:20.000
So SVJN from ZDNet was at the Linux Plumbers Conference

03:20.000 --> 03:22.840
and put the question to Linus about how

03:22.840 --> 03:24.720
he feels about Microsoft.

03:24.720 --> 03:28.360
Linus is then quoted as saying, the whole anti-Microsoft thing

03:28.360 --> 03:31.360
was sometimes funny as a joke, but not really.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.640
Today, they're actually much friendlier.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.920
I talk to Microsoft engineers at various conferences,

03:35.920 --> 03:39.180
and I feel like, yes, they have changed.

03:39.180 --> 03:40.920
And the engineers are happy.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.720
They're, like, really happy working on Linux.

03:43.720 --> 03:48.400
So I completely dismiss all this anti-Microsoft stuff.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.680
If you want more context, you can read the full article

03:50.680 --> 03:52.440
over at OMG Ubuntu.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.920
We'll have that linked in the show notes.

03:54.920 --> 03:58.600
This, to me, sounds like an individual, Linus,

03:58.600 --> 04:01.360
that has to interact with other individuals, Microsoft

04:01.360 --> 04:04.160
developers, on an ongoing basis and has

04:04.160 --> 04:07.480
formed what is pretty much considered a cordial working

04:07.480 --> 04:08.160
relationship.

04:08.160 --> 04:08.440
Right.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.400
I mean, I think it's very different from our perspective

04:10.400 --> 04:12.900
watching development happen and different parties interested.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.640
Linus is right there in the mix of it all.

04:14.640 --> 04:15.560
And yeah, there are probably things

04:15.560 --> 04:16.980
about kernel development, in terms

04:16.980 --> 04:19.840
of people, less so than as an abstraction a far away.

04:19.840 --> 04:21.800
You recall he had a very pragmatic stance

04:21.800 --> 04:24.960
about Android and the use of the Linux kernel

04:24.960 --> 04:27.900
and having really zero issue that people don't know

04:27.900 --> 04:28.760
they're using Linux.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.520
He was fine with that.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.560
That's not what we created Linux for.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.160
So the whole anti-Microsoft thing

04:35.160 --> 04:38.640
was sometimes funny as a joke, but not really.

04:38.640 --> 04:41.560
That's the line that stuck out to me the most.

04:41.560 --> 04:44.920
Because he's kind of like saying the whole MS dollar sign thing,

04:44.920 --> 04:47.400
it never really was all that funny.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.720
And it feels like, in a couple of big ways,

04:49.720 --> 04:52.880
the community is being told, move on.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.540
Move on with the Microsoft stuff.

04:54.540 --> 04:56.480
Move on with Richard Stallman.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.000
Let's just move on.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.760
And it's a big ask, both of those things.

05:00.760 --> 05:03.400
And they both represent a massive sea change.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.640
And I think that's why it's taking so much processing

05:05.640 --> 05:06.200
by everyone.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.000
It kind of makes me think we need

05:07.000 --> 05:08.720
to be more nimble in general, right?

05:08.720 --> 05:11.040
It's not to say that Microsoft's going to be a great Linux

05:11.040 --> 05:11.800
ally forever.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.160
We just need to judge it based on what's happening now.

05:14.160 --> 05:15.800
And I don't mean to say forget the past,

05:15.800 --> 05:18.040
but also remember the present.

05:18.040 --> 05:20.760
By the time we get it figured out, things will have changed.

05:20.760 --> 05:21.880
Exactly.

05:21.880 --> 05:24.860
Well then, moving on from that, let's

05:24.860 --> 05:29.360
talk about the future of OpenPGB in Thunderbird.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.360
I love Enigma.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.800
It's my go-to first thing I install when

05:33.800 --> 05:35.560
I have a new Thunderbird installation.

05:35.560 --> 05:39.620
And it makes using GPG encryption really straightforward.

05:39.620 --> 05:41.480
I can sign my messages really simply.

05:41.480 --> 05:42.960
I can decrypt and encrypt them.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.280
It's a great piece of software.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.080
Yeah, something tells me if you had

05:45.080 --> 05:46.400
to go do this in the command line,

05:46.400 --> 05:47.600
you just wouldn't do it.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.440
I mean, maybe make my keys and stuff.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.240
It's actually not so bad, like I suppose,

05:52.240 --> 05:53.880
if you're just going to encrypt a text file

05:53.880 --> 05:55.640
and then attach a text file to an email.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.720
It's not that bad to do it from the command line,

05:57.720 --> 05:59.720
but a whole email?

05:59.720 --> 06:02.540
It's really crazy, that workflow.

06:02.540 --> 06:05.000
That's why I was a little surprised to see

06:05.000 --> 06:09.200
that Enigma is essentially, for Thunderbird,

06:09.200 --> 06:11.880
going away with the new releases of Thunderbird.

06:11.880 --> 06:12.600
This is interesting, right?

06:12.600 --> 06:14.800
Because people use it a lot.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.360
It's kind of being depended on.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.160
It has a pretty substantial feature set.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.440
It is a really full-featured, and sometimes

06:22.440 --> 06:26.440
maybe overly complicated, piece of software.

06:26.440 --> 06:30.600
But it appears that the Mozilla developers are actively

06:30.600 --> 06:33.840
working on not just improving the old code

06:33.840 --> 06:37.240
base of Thunderbird, but integrating encryption support

06:37.240 --> 06:41.040
for OpenPGP directly into Thunderbird as a core feature.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.080
Yeah, this is kind of huge.

06:43.080 --> 06:43.920
I'm excited about it.

06:43.920 --> 06:44.640
Yeah, I am too.

06:44.640 --> 06:45.640
I think it's good.

06:45.640 --> 06:47.960
I think it means more people have access to encryption.

06:47.960 --> 06:51.560
And having it built in means that perhaps more people will

06:51.560 --> 06:53.480
use it, so using encryption becomes

06:53.480 --> 06:57.920
more of a norm, which I think is tremendously important.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.760
But the Mozilla developers, the Thunderbird developers,

07:00.760 --> 07:03.860
and the Enigma developer are very upfront about the fact

07:03.860 --> 07:06.160
that the stuff that's going to be built into Thunderbird

07:06.160 --> 07:08.320
will be nowhere as feature-complete as to what

07:08.320 --> 07:09.320
Enigma could do.

07:09.320 --> 07:10.840
Yeah, although Patrick Brunschwig,

07:10.840 --> 07:13.920
the maintainer of Enigma, makes a good point here.

07:13.920 --> 07:17.000
But in my eyes, this is by far outweighed by the fact

07:17.000 --> 07:19.480
that OpenPGP will be part of Thunderbird,

07:19.480 --> 07:23.060
and no add-on and no third-party tool will be required.

07:23.060 --> 07:24.520
And that's probably worth it, right?

07:24.520 --> 07:26.880
If you need more features, I'm sure new add-ons

07:26.880 --> 07:28.720
will spring into existence.

07:28.720 --> 07:31.880
And well, go make a PR against future Thunderbird.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.840
Yeah, Enigma itself won't be moving forward.

07:34.840 --> 07:40.160
They write that the new API is just nowhere as feature-rich

07:40.160 --> 07:42.720
as the old web extensions API that they

07:42.720 --> 07:44.800
could use to create extensions, and there's just

07:44.800 --> 07:46.720
less stuff they can do now.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.220
But overall, it makes Thunderbird

07:48.220 --> 07:49.360
a more secure product.

07:49.360 --> 07:49.760
Yeah.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.720
Patrick's going to continue to support and maintain

07:51.720 --> 07:55.200
Enigma for Thunderbird 68 until six months after Thunderbird

07:55.200 --> 07:58.120
78 comes out, and will also continue

07:58.120 --> 08:00.280
to support Enigma for Postbox, which is running

08:00.280 --> 08:02.000
on a different release schedule.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.440
What do you think, Wimpy?

08:03.440 --> 08:04.720
Could the team pull it off?

08:04.720 --> 08:06.760
Could they get you to switch back to Thunderbird?

08:06.760 --> 08:07.440
No.

08:07.440 --> 08:08.960
Never?

08:08.960 --> 08:11.200
Interestingly, there was a period

08:11.200 --> 08:14.820
at which I had Thunderbird and Evolution installed

08:14.820 --> 08:18.600
on my machine whilst I was evaluating Evolution.

08:18.600 --> 08:22.720
And I had a need to send a signed and also

08:22.720 --> 08:24.880
an encrypted email.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.680
And I chose to do it with Evolution

08:26.680 --> 08:31.440
because that encryption integration is just better.

08:31.440 --> 08:32.320
It's simpler, too.

08:32.320 --> 08:33.480
Yeah, it's simpler to use.

08:33.480 --> 08:33.960
Yeah.

08:33.960 --> 08:37.800
So I chose to use Evolution to send

08:37.800 --> 08:40.120
my signed and encrypted emails.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.760
So consequently, no.

08:42.760 --> 08:47.440
Thunderbird has served me very well for a very, very long time.

08:47.440 --> 08:52.240
And it has been for me, and is for many people,

08:52.240 --> 08:54.760
a staple of the Linux desktop.

08:54.760 --> 08:58.600
But I've found a new place to manage my email,

08:58.600 --> 09:00.960
and I'm very happy with where I've landed.

09:00.960 --> 09:01.680
Yeah.

09:01.680 --> 09:04.320
It is particularly straightforward and easy

09:04.320 --> 09:05.920
to use in Evolution.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.000
I say good on the Thunderbird project,

09:08.000 --> 09:09.880
though, for baking this feature in.

09:09.880 --> 09:12.880
I think your points are well taken, Wes.

09:12.880 --> 09:16.560
We should probably just step away from the old show

09:16.560 --> 09:17.240
here for a second.

09:17.240 --> 09:17.740
Come here.

09:17.740 --> 09:19.800
The cone of silence.

09:19.800 --> 09:20.760
Don't tell anybody this.

09:20.760 --> 09:21.760
It's so cozy in here.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.320
I love the cone.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.680
OK, I think we've got a problem.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.080
I don't know if this Atari VCS is going to work out.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.040
Do we have a problem, or do you have a problem?

09:30.040 --> 09:31.000
Yeah, I have a problem.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.560
Well, I mean, as the royal we as a show,

09:33.560 --> 09:35.400
because I backed this thing for the show.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.040
Oh, yeah, right.

09:36.040 --> 09:36.920
I mean, not for myself.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.160
I backed it for the show, Wes.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.840
Oh, here we go.

09:39.840 --> 09:43.120
Oh, Wimpy's in the cone of silence.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.840
Yeah, so this is bad.

09:45.840 --> 09:48.040
It looks like a designer who was contracted

09:48.040 --> 09:53.040
to work with Atari on the VCS has told the register

09:53.040 --> 09:57.120
that they haven't been paid going back over six months.

09:57.120 --> 10:00.080
The consultancy has not been paid by Atari.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.800
And he says, as a small company, they're

10:02.800 --> 10:05.640
lucky to have survived this long.

10:05.640 --> 10:06.880
Because it's been rough, Wes.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.320
Yeah, I mean, if you don't have dollars coming in,

10:08.320 --> 10:09.920
how are you supposed to keep working?

10:09.920 --> 10:11.840
Here's the concern I have.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.720
This launch of this retro console

10:13.720 --> 10:17.520
that looks like the old Atari running Linux that's supposedly

10:17.520 --> 10:19.920
going to have the ability to run other operating

10:19.920 --> 10:24.200
systems on it as well, it's already late at this point.

10:24.200 --> 10:29.160
And it's also listed as one of the three operational goals

10:29.160 --> 10:35.000
for Atari in 2019, 20, and 2020, along adding more games

10:35.000 --> 10:35.800
to their portfolio.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.160
But it's not here.

10:37.160 --> 10:39.240
And they're not paying their bills.

10:39.240 --> 10:42.000
And it's running super late.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
And the more delayed it gets, the more Raspberry Pi can do.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.280
And it's just getting more and more embarrassing in all

10:47.280 --> 10:49.200
of the ways.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.560
So what's your bet?

10:51.560 --> 10:54.040
Am I getting my Atari VCS ever, do you think?

10:54.040 --> 10:54.600
I don't think so.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.200
No, never.

10:55.200 --> 10:55.760
No, never.

10:55.760 --> 10:56.560
It's not evident.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.200
You think never?

10:57.200 --> 10:57.800
Never.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.040
Yeah, I agree with Wes.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.400
Now, the next question is, will you be refunded?

11:01.400 --> 11:02.160
No.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.360
You don't think I'm even going to get

11:03.360 --> 11:04.840
a piece of crap hardware?

11:04.840 --> 11:07.040
No, I didn't think this three years ago.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.280
I thought it would be delayed.

11:08.280 --> 11:08.920
I mean, I thought it would be.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.160
I'm like, actually, one of the reasons I backed this,

11:11.160 --> 11:12.880
I'm like, well, this is going to be a story.

11:12.880 --> 11:16.320
So that part has been working out.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.480
Yeah, it's definitely become a story, that's for sure.

11:18.480 --> 11:19.920
But I think it's interesting, too,

11:19.920 --> 11:24.320
where some people that have worked on the project that

11:24.320 --> 11:27.000
have chosen to remain anonymous have basically

11:27.000 --> 11:31.680
said that the executives have no clue what's

11:31.680 --> 11:36.560
going on, that they wanted to build a Linux-based OS,

11:36.560 --> 11:39.960
but it may not be, that they were trying

11:39.960 --> 11:41.280
to sign a deal with Walmart.

11:41.280 --> 11:45.360
But Walmart wanted them to be under the $250 price point,

11:45.360 --> 11:48.640
so they just pull four gigs of RAM out of the machine,

11:48.640 --> 11:52.080
that they show up to a game conference with empty shells

11:52.080 --> 11:54.080
with no hardware in them.

11:54.080 --> 11:54.600
I don't know.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.520
I mean, it's all adding up to be pretty sketchy.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.120
Yeah, that is sketch.

11:59.120 --> 12:02.400
Well, I congratulate them.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.800
Congratulations, Atari.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.760
You are continuing on in a long tradition of hardware

12:07.760 --> 12:10.880
fundraisers, and we appreciate you

12:10.880 --> 12:14.920
keeping that culture alive, keeping it strong.

12:14.920 --> 12:17.000
And I would love to be proved wrong.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.640
I would also love to be proved wrong.

12:19.640 --> 12:21.640
I would love at least a little piece of hardware,

12:21.640 --> 12:23.800
a little something, a little retro-looking piece

12:23.800 --> 12:27.280
of hardware that I could play video games on.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.440
Godspeed.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.160
Godspeed to you.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.200
I hope you guys are wrong.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.680
Jeez.

12:33.680 --> 12:37.200
All right, let's change gears, do a little housekeeping here.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.800
We just released a, I don't know,

12:39.800 --> 12:41.440
I wouldn't call it a breakdown so much,

12:41.440 --> 12:46.320
but maybe like a guide to reverse proxy.

12:46.320 --> 12:47.560
I was going to say just like a nerd out,

12:47.560 --> 12:49.460
because we were all pretty excited to talk about it.

12:49.460 --> 12:50.160
Yeah, that's true.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.560
Yeah, thank you for joining us.

12:51.560 --> 12:56.280
So Wes, Alex, and myself got together for a Jupiter Extras

12:56.280 --> 13:00.200
on how we do reverse proxy, when we use NGINX,

13:00.200 --> 13:04.320
when we use traffic, and how it all works with containers.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.680
Yeah, why you might need a reverse proxy at all.

13:06.680 --> 13:11.720
Plus, we talk about a bunch of really great applications

13:11.720 --> 13:16.560
and little tricks and tools for updating your Let's Encrypt

13:16.560 --> 13:19.200
certificates and your dynamic domain, or your IP

13:19.200 --> 13:21.320
if you've got a domain name, and all these little tools

13:21.320 --> 13:25.200
we use to do our own sort of fundamental hosting

13:25.200 --> 13:26.280
of reverse proxy.

13:26.280 --> 13:29.480
So go check out xers.show slash 19 for that.

13:29.480 --> 13:31.500
It's 28 minutes long, and hopefully you

13:31.500 --> 13:34.000
kind of will walk away with a pretty good concept of how

13:34.000 --> 13:35.360
it all works.

13:35.360 --> 13:38.920
And something we use quite a bit in production.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.040
We have traffic now on two different systems

13:41.040 --> 13:45.320
in production, and Wes Payne's making me a convert.

13:45.320 --> 13:46.480
I was an NGINX man.

13:46.480 --> 13:47.720
Yeah, I mean, I'm looking forward

13:47.720 --> 13:49.720
to playing with version two a little bit more,

13:49.720 --> 13:52.760
so I'm sure we'll be talking about it again.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.120
I should mention as well, with that xers.show release

13:55.120 --> 13:58.280
we did of reverse proxies, we have another one coming out

13:58.280 --> 14:01.000
that is all about the basics of containers, what

14:01.000 --> 14:03.400
it is at a fundamental level, and some things

14:03.400 --> 14:04.560
you need to know about them.

14:04.560 --> 14:07.920
No hype, no sales, it's just Alex and I doing a breakdown

14:07.920 --> 14:09.040
of how containers work.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.440
That'll be coming out in the xers feed as well.

14:11.440 --> 14:15.320
And then later this week, selfhosted.show,

14:15.320 --> 14:18.480
my home network for under $200.

14:18.480 --> 14:21.960
How I set up my whole home network for under $200.

14:21.960 --> 14:22.720
That's in there.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.440
That's coming out in self-hosted this week.

14:24.440 --> 14:25.520
And then, of course, I should mention

14:25.520 --> 14:26.840
we're going to be in Texas.

14:26.840 --> 14:27.360
Tomorrow.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.640
Tomorrow, and this weekend as the show comes out.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.240
So if you're in San Antonio, going

14:32.240 --> 14:34.680
to make it to Texas Cyber Summit, or just in that area.

14:34.680 --> 14:35.440
Come say hi to us.

14:35.440 --> 14:36.360
Come say hi.

14:36.360 --> 14:40.160
There will be a barbecue Thursday night,

14:40.160 --> 14:40.960
or Wednesday night?

14:40.960 --> 14:41.520
Wednesday night.

14:41.520 --> 14:42.240
Wednesday night.

14:42.240 --> 14:42.720
Which?

14:42.720 --> 14:44.040
6 PM local time, I believe.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.600
Yeah, you and I will just be landing around then.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.320
So we may not make it to the very end

14:48.320 --> 14:49.560
if we make it.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.360
But there will be a barbecue going.

14:51.360 --> 14:51.880
Cheesy.

14:51.880 --> 14:53.400
You'll probably try to make it to most of that,

14:53.400 --> 14:53.840
I would imagine.

14:53.840 --> 14:54.320
Oh, yeah.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.520
I'll be there for sure.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.320
I hear that the cake is not a lie.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.440
It will, in fact, be there.

14:58.440 --> 15:02.240
So come help us celebrate the un-birthday for Elle and Allie

15:02.240 --> 15:04.080
and just kind of get together and hang out.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.560
I think we have something like 30,

15:06.560 --> 15:08.960
33 people so far signed up for that meetup.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.240
People don't say no to barbecue.

15:10.240 --> 15:10.840
Never do.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.320
You don't say no to barbecue.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.160
And Carl has vetted the barbecue for us.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.760
So we know it's good.

15:15.760 --> 15:16.760
I love that.

15:16.760 --> 15:17.400
All right.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.000
There you have it.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.720
That's what you need to know about.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.360
Moving right along now.

15:22.360 --> 15:26.840
We, well, really me, had a situation

15:26.840 --> 15:28.840
that was particularly challenging to solve.

15:28.840 --> 15:34.640
In my home network, I am afflicted by double net.

15:34.640 --> 15:37.520
We all have it from time to time, every now and then.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.960
Maybe you're in a hotel.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.040
Maybe you're going somewhere that's

15:42.040 --> 15:44.080
off of your regular beaten path.

15:44.080 --> 15:48.360
And you wind up, even though you tried your best,

15:48.360 --> 15:49.720
in a double net situation.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.520
And you've got kind of a complicated setup.

15:51.520 --> 15:53.640
I mean, you've got a mobile home, right?

15:53.640 --> 15:54.480
Right.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.680
So I frequently find myself in the double net.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.440
Now, just a brief explanation of what I mean there.

15:59.440 --> 16:03.840
When I say double net, I mean that my internet connection

16:03.840 --> 16:08.920
is getting a 192.168.1.something address

16:08.920 --> 16:10.440
as if it were on a LAN.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.540
That is the quote unquote public address

16:13.540 --> 16:14.760
that my router is getting.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.880
So you've got that from your ISP regardless.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.440
Yeah, so I'm on a 192.

16:18.440 --> 16:23.080
And then my LAN's also on a 172.16.0.0, whatever.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.120
So I have a net just for a day.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.160
So it's net all the way down.

16:27.160 --> 16:30.680
This makes accepting inbound connections

16:30.680 --> 16:31.680
essentially impossible.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.400
I can't SSH into my LAN.

16:33.400 --> 16:38.360
I can't VPN into my LAN because of this double net situation.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.280
It's the worst.

16:39.280 --> 16:41.960
Yeah, no just easy open up a port on your firewall

16:41.960 --> 16:44.760
and call it a day, right, that you don't have access to that.

16:44.760 --> 16:45.440
Right.

16:45.440 --> 16:50.040
But I demand, I demand full remote access, Wes.

16:50.040 --> 16:53.520
The goal I wanted was to connect the studio network

16:53.520 --> 16:57.480
and my home network together.

16:57.480 --> 17:01.120
So when sitting on either LAN, I could access systems

17:01.120 --> 17:02.240
from the other LAN.

17:02.240 --> 17:02.720
Right.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.160
I mean, you've been, as people following self-hosted, well,

17:05.160 --> 17:07.680
no, you're doing all kinds of fun stuff,

17:07.680 --> 17:09.360
hosting things on all manner of gadgets.

17:09.360 --> 17:13.600
You've got your RV just automated and wired up to the nines.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.360
Yeah, this upcoming self-hosted episode

17:16.360 --> 17:19.360
goes into some of that.

17:19.360 --> 17:21.120
There's a lot of ways you can solve this.

17:21.120 --> 17:23.440
Tink VPN is something we've talked about.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.280
Sure, open VPN is very popular.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.800
I suppose at the end of the day, you

17:26.800 --> 17:29.720
could really just do it with a SSH tunnel.

17:29.720 --> 17:30.760
Sure.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.360
There's also a lot of services out there

17:32.360 --> 17:34.940
that will sort of forward those ports along for you

17:34.940 --> 17:38.880
and give you a port on their public IP address.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.920
But that's not really the spirit of what we wanted to do.

17:40.920 --> 17:41.560
Right, right.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.760
I wanted to solve this using some open source software,

17:44.760 --> 17:46.560
built-in stuff to Linux.

17:46.560 --> 17:49.040
We could have used open VPN too, but we

17:49.040 --> 17:50.360
wanted to mess around with WireGuard

17:50.360 --> 17:51.740
because it was a great opportunity

17:51.740 --> 17:56.040
to learn what it's capable of and what it's not capable of.

17:56.040 --> 17:59.120
And there's some infrastructure that you

17:59.120 --> 18:01.360
have to build yourself when you're using WireGuard

18:01.360 --> 18:03.720
that you might not with other solutions.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.800
So a quick recap.

18:05.800 --> 18:09.360
WireGuard is a new type of VPN connection

18:09.360 --> 18:11.640
available for Linux that right now

18:11.640 --> 18:13.520
uses some very clever crypto called Zynk,

18:13.520 --> 18:16.100
but sounds like possibly in the future

18:16.100 --> 18:19.800
we'll use the standard crypto that's in the Linux kernel.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.840
It creates a new interface on your box, a new network

18:22.840 --> 18:23.600
interface.

18:23.600 --> 18:27.080
Shows up like any old interface, like eth0, now you've got wg0.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.680
Yep, like just another interface.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.240
And you can up and down that interface.

18:31.240 --> 18:34.600
When it's up, your VPN is established.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.640
And you can interact with it like you would

18:36.640 --> 18:38.240
any other interface on your system.

18:38.240 --> 18:41.080
It's so great that way.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.920
Another nice thing about it is it's just minimal and clean

18:43.920 --> 18:44.760
and fast.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.520
And unlike some other options like open VPN, say,

18:47.520 --> 18:49.600
there's not as much complicated, stateful tracking

18:49.600 --> 18:53.280
of connection status because all the cryptography handles it.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.440
And you just basically are shoving encrypted packets

18:55.440 --> 18:56.640
at a host.

18:56.640 --> 19:00.000
That host that's receiving it knows that if it can read that,

19:00.000 --> 19:01.760
it's got a big map of allowed IPs

19:01.760 --> 19:03.760
and which keys can send from those IPs.

19:03.760 --> 19:04.880
And it just handles it.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.240
So instead of having to make sure that your VPN's restarted

19:07.240 --> 19:09.560
correctly, if you've got your interface up

19:09.560 --> 19:11.040
and you have an internet connection,

19:11.040 --> 19:12.520
WireGuard's going to figure it out.

19:12.520 --> 19:15.520
Now, the other thing that it does really well

19:15.520 --> 19:16.960
is it bounces back.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.600
WireGuard can get knocked down, but it gets back up

19:19.600 --> 19:21.000
every single time.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.960
And this is particularly useful in an RV that's

19:23.960 --> 19:27.000
going down the road that sometimes will have connectivity

19:27.000 --> 19:28.360
and sometimes will not.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.400
Sometimes I'll be parked in a national park that

19:30.400 --> 19:33.160
has no wireless signal for miles.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.160
And then when I get back into civilization,

19:35.160 --> 19:37.280
I just want things to kind of pick back up and start

19:37.280 --> 19:37.960
working again.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.080
No futzing.

19:39.080 --> 19:43.040
WireGuard's really good at that, too, a fault.

19:43.040 --> 19:47.040
We had even bit Wes today as we were setting some of this up.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.680
Yeah, we've been testing things out.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.760
So last night, I was working on some of this.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.740
And I VPNed into the studio from home.

19:52.740 --> 19:55.180
And of course, forgot to town that interface.

19:55.180 --> 19:56.880
And then we're doing some troubleshooting.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.560
And I'm realizing, I can't ping that host.

19:58.560 --> 19:59.220
What's happening?

19:59.220 --> 20:00.480
It's working on your machine.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.840
And of course, I was routing through WireGuard

20:02.840 --> 20:04.680
because it had just magically bounced back.

20:04.680 --> 20:05.640
It reconnected.

20:05.640 --> 20:09.040
And it just does that.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.000
And that's one of the aspects that I really want

20:11.000 --> 20:12.760
in this particular kind of setup.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.280
The idea being that when I do have connectivity,

20:15.280 --> 20:18.200
I can traverse both lands with ease,

20:18.200 --> 20:20.960
as if there is a connection persistently through them.

20:20.960 --> 20:21.460
Right.

20:21.460 --> 20:22.960
I mean, you might be doing a show, let's say,

20:22.960 --> 20:23.880
remotely from the rig.

20:23.880 --> 20:26.440
And you want to come in and be able to mess with the mixer

20:26.440 --> 20:28.040
like you're on the local network.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.840
The other reason why I really want to do this

20:29.840 --> 20:36.320
is I'm trying to not expose any public ports on my homeland.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.160
So there's no inbound connections

20:38.160 --> 20:42.120
other than an outbound WireGuard connection.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.560
So I have an outbound WireGuard connection

20:44.560 --> 20:48.760
on a Raspberry Pi in my RV that runs Raspbian.

20:48.760 --> 20:52.600
And then on there is Docker, which is running PiHole.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.880
So this is essentially my network services Pi.

20:55.880 --> 20:59.840
And on there, I have a persistent WireGuard connection

20:59.840 --> 21:02.720
back to the studio.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.480
The neat thing about it is WireGuard

21:05.480 --> 21:07.720
is pretty clever on how it routes traffic.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.360
It's pretty intelligent about that.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.560
Yeah, you have all kinds of options,

21:10.560 --> 21:12.760
especially if you're using some of the nice like the WG

21:12.760 --> 21:15.960
quick script that comes with the WireGuard tool set.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.960
As long as you've given it the right information

21:17.960 --> 21:21.040
about what IP ranges are in play,

21:21.040 --> 21:23.040
it's going to run a lot of the right IP tables

21:23.040 --> 21:23.720
commands for you.

21:23.720 --> 21:25.600
So you don't have to worry so much about that.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.640
Yeah, that is really nice.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.440
I really appreciate that.

21:30.440 --> 21:35.360
And with a little bit of extra clever DNS trickery,

21:35.360 --> 21:37.200
we've got this thing working pretty well.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.080
So let's talk about a couple of the things

21:39.080 --> 21:40.880
we had to do to actually make this work.

21:40.880 --> 21:43.600
So we have an outbound connection from my RV

21:43.600 --> 21:45.800
coming into the studio.

21:45.800 --> 21:49.520
From a box here in the studio, just any one of these computers,

21:49.520 --> 21:51.720
I can now access the systems in my RV.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.200
How did we make that possible?

21:53.200 --> 21:56.280
We had to do a bit of routing trickery,

21:56.280 --> 21:58.520
a little bit of DHCP trickery, and a little bit of DNS.

21:58.520 --> 22:00.640
But at the end of the day, once you know what to do,

22:00.640 --> 22:02.920
it's only about maybe a half hour's worth of work.

22:02.920 --> 22:07.160
Yeah, so once we've got our WireGuard VPN network,

22:07.160 --> 22:09.000
it's got its own IP space.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.160
And then there's an IP space for the studio,

22:11.160 --> 22:14.880
and there's a different IP space for your network at the RV.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.760
So basically, we just had to make sure

22:16.760 --> 22:19.120
that both sides knew about the other one.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.520
So somewhere you need to add a route entry that says,

22:21.520 --> 22:23.840
oh, if you want to get to space A,

22:23.840 --> 22:25.800
here's the machine to do it, whether that's the Pi

22:25.800 --> 22:28.800
or whatever gateway box we've got here.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.880
For the most part, depending on how you set it up,

22:30.880 --> 22:32.480
WireGuard will handle that, or you

22:32.480 --> 22:35.440
may need to add a routing entry somewhere

22:35.440 --> 22:37.320
if you don't have that pushed from your gateway.

22:37.320 --> 22:41.600
So in your RV, we're using DNS mask on the Pi hole, which

22:41.600 --> 22:44.520
is kind of great, and added a little bit of extra config

22:44.520 --> 22:47.480
that basically tells anyone who's pulling a DHCP lease

22:47.480 --> 22:50.080
that, oh, hey, there's this additional network,

22:50.080 --> 22:53.200
and to get to it, well, use me as a gateway.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.200
We didn't quite have that option here at the studio

22:55.200 --> 22:57.920
for really some boring reasons.

22:57.920 --> 23:00.120
So we've just added some manual routes for the moment

23:00.120 --> 23:02.120
to machines that need access back to your RV,

23:02.120 --> 23:03.960
and that works just the same.

23:03.960 --> 23:04.600
Yeah.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.240
And so every device at the RV knows how to route back here,

23:07.240 --> 23:08.760
but only select systems in the studio

23:08.760 --> 23:10.680
can route to the RV, which I kind of prefer anyways.

23:10.680 --> 23:10.800
Yeah.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.520
I mean, my laptop doesn't need access.

23:12.520 --> 23:13.000
No.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.520
And you know how to do it if for some reason

23:15.520 --> 23:16.900
I needed your help with something,

23:16.900 --> 23:20.120
so it's not like it's not a possibility.

23:20.120 --> 23:23.960
And then we also used DNS mask to put some nice names to all

23:23.960 --> 23:25.680
these different IP addresses.

23:25.680 --> 23:25.920
Yeah.

23:25.920 --> 23:27.720
I mean, since we were already using Pi hole,

23:27.720 --> 23:30.920
and then took the opportunity to deploy another Pi hole here

23:30.920 --> 23:34.840
at the studio, and it's using DNS mask under the hood,

23:34.840 --> 23:36.920
it's just so easy to add that stuff, right?

23:36.920 --> 23:38.720
So we just added an extra file where

23:38.720 --> 23:40.240
we defined some new hosts entries

23:40.240 --> 23:43.520
and statically add them for any of the ones we care about.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.360
And that file, it just looks like a host file,

23:45.360 --> 23:48.880
you just put the machine and the IP in there, and done.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.080
It's really easy.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.920
And now all the machines that get that from the DHCP server

23:53.920 --> 23:54.520
can query that.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.240
Now they can talk to each other by machine name.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.960
And we have created, essentially,

23:58.960 --> 24:03.800
a little two-way tunnel using WireGuard

24:03.800 --> 24:06.900
that involves no inbound connections to my homeland.

24:06.900 --> 24:07.400
Right.

24:07.400 --> 24:09.160
It's nice that way, so that as long as you've

24:09.160 --> 24:10.560
got internet connection, well, WireGuard's

24:10.560 --> 24:12.400
just going to go build up a tether right here

24:12.400 --> 24:13.680
to the studio.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.840
And of course, what we may want to do down the line

24:15.840 --> 24:17.600
is add a few other redundant connections.

24:17.600 --> 24:20.160
We've got some VPSes out there in the cloud,

24:20.160 --> 24:22.920
and we could add some there too, so that as long as your RV's

24:22.920 --> 24:25.920
got connection and not all of our machines are down,

24:25.920 --> 24:27.240
you're going to have a backdoor in.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.240
Westpane, you're always watching my backdoor.

24:29.240 --> 24:31.160
Now we also decided to play around,

24:31.160 --> 24:33.320
and really this is how this all got kicked off,

24:33.320 --> 24:36.480
to tell you the truth, with a tool called Subspace.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.440
Not only does it have a bad ass name,

24:38.440 --> 24:44.360
but it is a very elegant, simple-to-use WireGuard VPN

24:44.360 --> 24:46.040
server GUI.

24:46.040 --> 24:49.320
Yes, friends, it's a graphical front end to WireGuard.

24:49.320 --> 24:53.920
It's called Subspace, and it has a couple of catches.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.680
It really wants to own the box it's on.

24:55.680 --> 24:57.800
Yeah, so this is coming from portal.cloud.

24:57.800 --> 24:58.600
It's open source.

24:58.600 --> 25:02.040
It's MIT-licensed and mostly based in Go.

25:02.040 --> 25:03.920
And if you're just running this as a machine,

25:03.920 --> 25:05.020
you want to have some VPS that you're

25:05.020 --> 25:06.600
going to connect a whole bunch of other devices

25:06.600 --> 25:10.440
to when you want to sort of form a VPN that way, it is great.

25:10.440 --> 25:13.360
Especially if you don't want to customize any of your configs,

25:13.360 --> 25:15.080
Subspace works very well.

25:15.080 --> 25:18.000
Yes, I'll also just add a little side note here.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.160
When I was messing around with Subspace,

25:20.160 --> 25:24.120
I noted that Lin Note has a community image that's

25:24.120 --> 25:27.160
ready to go with WireGuard all pre-installed.

25:27.160 --> 25:30.840
WireGuard is not hard to set up on pretty much all major

25:30.840 --> 25:34.560
distros, because there's so many great guides.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.660
But there are now some VPS images

25:36.660 --> 25:39.360
that are one-click deployments with WireGuard ready to go.

25:39.360 --> 25:41.460
And then you could just throw a Subspace on top of it,

25:41.460 --> 25:42.160
and you're done.

25:42.160 --> 25:43.960
Yeah, I mean, we were just running it from a container.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.660
But since it's Go, I'm sure you could

25:45.660 --> 25:47.760
find all manner of ways of running that.

25:47.760 --> 25:50.220
Yeah, it's going to give you a UI to manage devices,

25:50.220 --> 25:51.520
to manage keys.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.900
And while we didn't test this aspect of it very much,

25:53.900 --> 25:56.320
because we didn't require this, it

25:56.320 --> 25:59.600
may also do some easy name resolution for devices

25:59.600 --> 26:01.880
that are on the VPN IP space.

26:01.880 --> 26:04.400
Yeah, it turns out it's also running DNS mask,

26:04.400 --> 26:07.160
and then adding host entries for as you add them,

26:07.160 --> 26:09.600
configuring them, and giving access to your VPN.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.600
And that's really where Subspace shines.

26:11.600 --> 26:14.000
The kind of trickiest part about WireGuard often

26:14.000 --> 26:16.360
is managing all the keys that you have to keep track of,

26:16.360 --> 26:20.680
especially once you've got, say, five, six, 10, 20 machines.

26:20.680 --> 26:23.080
With Subspace, you've got them all there as a list.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.800
And you, as the administrator, can go download those configs,

26:25.800 --> 26:28.080
modify them, mess with them if you need to.

26:28.080 --> 26:30.480
Now, unfortunately, you're going to have to do that manually.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.720
And this is where some of the limitations of Subspace

26:32.720 --> 26:33.960
comes in.

26:33.960 --> 26:37.080
It seems to me like a project ripe for some community

26:37.080 --> 26:39.720
involvement, because right now, it hasn't been updated

26:39.720 --> 26:41.960
in a couple months, and sort of seems like it's probably just

26:41.960 --> 26:44.380
tossed over as an open source contribution, which is great.

26:44.380 --> 26:46.120
I don't mean that as a bad thing.

26:46.120 --> 26:49.480
It just means it doesn't have a lot of customization built in.

26:49.480 --> 26:52.040
Yeah, it's made by a VPS provider

26:52.040 --> 26:54.640
to just create something that's easy for their customers

26:54.640 --> 26:55.400
to use.

26:55.400 --> 26:56.880
And I think it is very much sort of like,

26:56.880 --> 26:58.440
here's the open source version of it.

26:58.440 --> 27:00.880
However, it's so fantastic, a little bit of love,

27:00.880 --> 27:03.040
and it could be perfect.

27:03.040 --> 27:06.000
In our testing, I can't remember how long.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.880
I want to say 10 seconds is how long

27:07.880 --> 27:11.360
it took me to get a WireGuard VPN created and connected

27:11.360 --> 27:11.880
on an iPhone.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.860
Yeah, I just sent you the URL and the password,

27:13.860 --> 27:14.760
and you were in.

27:14.760 --> 27:19.240
It's so good, because Subspace will create a QR code that

27:19.240 --> 27:22.480
contains all the config info you need for the WireGuard

27:22.480 --> 27:23.800
VPN on the client.

27:23.800 --> 27:27.200
So as fast as my phone could read the QR code,

27:27.200 --> 27:29.800
my VPN configuration was set up.

27:29.800 --> 27:33.880
I tap in my iPhone pin code once to add it to the network stack.

27:33.880 --> 27:36.280
And at the network level, I can now WireGuard VPN

27:36.280 --> 27:38.080
from my frickin' iPhone.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.720
That's what's so great about WireGuard.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.760
I mean, one of the many things that's so great, really,

27:41.760 --> 27:44.260
is that the mobile clients have really come a long way.

27:44.260 --> 27:45.880
Even on iOS, what feels like it should

27:45.880 --> 27:48.480
be a pretty foreign platform to WireGuard,

27:48.480 --> 27:50.520
those apps are rock solid.

27:50.520 --> 27:52.280
So Subspace is killer when you're just

27:52.280 --> 27:54.600
trying to create something that's really easy for end

27:54.600 --> 27:56.600
users to consume as well.

27:56.600 --> 28:00.120
Family members that you want to give remote VPN access

28:00.120 --> 28:02.880
to your LAN, maybe you have, like for me,

28:02.880 --> 28:05.520
my notes now are on my LAN.

28:05.520 --> 28:07.360
They're offline, and I use WireGuard.

28:07.360 --> 28:09.800
Just I leave that persistently connected when I'm not home,

28:09.800 --> 28:12.440
and I just access everything as if I were there.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.240
And so it's such a great tool.

28:14.240 --> 28:16.640
Cheesy, I think you happen to be playing with WireGuard

28:16.640 --> 28:17.760
over the weekend, too.

28:17.760 --> 28:20.000
Yeah, so my use case is a little different.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
I wasn't necessarily trying to connect to LANs.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.340
I just wanted something that whenever I was traveling,

28:25.340 --> 28:28.600
I could easily connect through a VPN

28:28.600 --> 28:30.980
and kind of tunnel my traffic through and stuff.

28:30.980 --> 28:34.240
And I connected to a private VPN provider.

28:34.240 --> 28:37.240
In my case, I'm trying out VPN AC.

28:37.240 --> 28:39.000
There are a ton of different ones out there,

28:39.000 --> 28:43.660
though I will say that it seems to be the least supported

28:43.660 --> 28:47.040
option WireGuard does compared to OpenVPN.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.320
So you might end up paying a little bit more for it.

28:49.320 --> 28:52.220
But I found that it was less expensive for me

28:52.220 --> 28:56.060
to buy a yearly subscription than what it would cost me

28:56.060 --> 28:58.280
to run the cheapest Linode.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.140
Yeah, it is kind of expensive if you're only

29:00.140 --> 29:03.400
using a VPS for WireGuard.

29:03.400 --> 29:06.620
You could do something like this and get just a hosted service.

29:06.620 --> 29:10.080
Were you worried, though, about privacy or security

29:10.080 --> 29:12.760
implications of connecting to a third party VPN versus one

29:12.760 --> 29:14.800
that you have a little more direct control over?

29:14.800 --> 29:15.680
Well, absolutely.

29:15.680 --> 29:18.040
I mean, that's always a concern.

29:18.040 --> 29:21.000
But I felt that given the use case,

29:21.000 --> 29:22.640
I think it's going to work fine for me.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.480
I'm not overly paranoid about it.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.640
You're more thinking like in the hotel scenario

29:27.640 --> 29:29.360
and you want to protect your traffic

29:29.360 --> 29:31.440
and you're not so worried about the other end.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.480
Exactly.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.880
I wouldn't necessarily be opposed

29:33.880 --> 29:38.020
to using a hosted WireGuard service provider.

29:38.020 --> 29:39.720
I think I heard NordVPN does it.

29:39.720 --> 29:40.800
Yeah, more and more are.

29:40.800 --> 29:41.920
Actually, I had an existing account

29:41.920 --> 29:42.800
with one of the providers.

29:42.800 --> 29:45.160
And I saw the other day, they have WireGuard support.

29:45.160 --> 29:46.520
Let's go around the horn in the mumble room.

29:46.520 --> 29:48.080
Does anybody in the mumble room want

29:48.080 --> 29:51.560
to volunteer a rough overview of how they do a VPN solution

29:51.560 --> 29:52.560
if they have one?

29:52.560 --> 29:53.640
I'm sure not everybody does.

29:53.640 --> 29:58.040
But someone there must be using a VPN for something.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.720
Well, in fact, I have one.

29:59.720 --> 30:03.520
I have a little dacha, so I mean a little apartment

30:03.520 --> 30:05.440
in the Alps, in the stress Alps.

30:05.440 --> 30:09.160
So I have direct access to this router.

30:09.160 --> 30:13.080
But it's using internal router software.

30:13.080 --> 30:14.080
It's a Fritz box.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.960
I don't know if you know these in the United States.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.920
But they have good VPN solutions.

30:18.920 --> 30:19.440
Cool.

30:19.440 --> 30:22.160
So you can directly access this router.

30:22.160 --> 30:27.720
And from then, you can access whatever you want.

30:27.720 --> 30:31.360
You know, I wouldn't be surprised if, for a lot of people,

30:31.360 --> 30:34.100
the answer is don't use a VPN, but just use SSH.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.640
Because you'd be surprised what you

30:35.640 --> 30:38.760
can get away with with port 40 and whatnot with just SSH.

30:38.760 --> 30:39.640
What about you, Wimpy?

30:39.640 --> 30:42.880
Do you have any remote login solutions?

30:42.880 --> 30:44.960
I mean, you travel a lot these days.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.340
You must, every now and then, wish

30:46.340 --> 30:47.640
you could get back to your LAN.

30:47.640 --> 30:50.560
Yes, I do have VPN running.

30:50.560 --> 30:54.320
I've got VPN running on a Raspberry Pi that

30:54.320 --> 30:57.000
is NATed through my router when I need

30:57.000 --> 31:00.080
to get to my home network.

31:00.080 --> 31:00.920
Very nice.

31:00.920 --> 31:02.120
So you're using the Pi.

31:02.120 --> 31:05.120
And do you find it to be sufficiently fast enough,

31:05.120 --> 31:07.520
even with the network limitations and whatnot

31:07.520 --> 31:08.200
of the Pis?

31:08.200 --> 31:10.760
Yeah, once the key negotiation is out of the way,

31:10.760 --> 31:12.360
it's perfectly fast enough.

31:12.360 --> 31:15.240
Because I'm usually just wanting to SSH in.

31:15.240 --> 31:18.360
I'm not wanting to stream video or anything like that.

31:18.360 --> 31:19.120
Sure, right.

31:19.120 --> 31:19.760
Yeah, yeah.

31:19.760 --> 31:20.760
Yeah, fair enough.

31:20.760 --> 31:21.640
What about you, Carl?

31:21.640 --> 31:23.100
Do you have any remote access solutions

31:23.100 --> 31:23.960
when you're on the go?

31:23.960 --> 31:24.600
Yes, sir.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.880
I'll use SSH tunnels pretty regularly.

31:26.880 --> 31:29.560
I just got used to it for my day job.

31:29.560 --> 31:31.280
And it's just my go-to now.

31:31.280 --> 31:36.600
Yeah, I think that's probably, if somebody wanted a hot take,

31:36.600 --> 31:38.440
I'd say don't use a VPN.

31:38.440 --> 31:39.560
Use an SSH tunnel.

31:39.560 --> 31:40.980
You know, one nice thing about doing it,

31:40.980 --> 31:43.640
the way you're doing it now too, is sort of the dynamic DNS

31:43.640 --> 31:45.280
stuff, well, it doesn't really matter as much,

31:45.280 --> 31:46.900
because you're not going that direction.

31:46.900 --> 31:47.400
Right.

31:47.400 --> 31:51.280
The connections, they all start from the RV,

31:51.280 --> 31:53.280
which is great, because that's where the connectivity is

31:53.280 --> 31:54.440
going to be the most hit and miss.

31:54.440 --> 31:56.440
There could be days where there's no connectivity.

31:56.440 --> 31:57.840
It's funny, as we were sort of testing this out,

31:57.840 --> 31:59.900
both on the RV and here at the studio,

31:59.900 --> 32:02.000
setting up those SSH tunnels just as back doors

32:02.000 --> 32:04.800
in case we messed something up, that was handy more than once.

32:04.800 --> 32:05.440
Yeah, yeah.

32:05.440 --> 32:08.480
One time, we couldn't get into the WireGuard server.

32:08.480 --> 32:10.960
So it was nice to get into another machine on the LAN.

32:10.960 --> 32:14.800
And then until the WireGuard tunnel was up from the RV,

32:14.800 --> 32:18.640
we had really no way into the RV other than an SSH tunnel.

32:18.640 --> 32:21.640
So I just was able to connect out, in that case,

32:21.640 --> 32:23.240
to a machine that we share.

32:23.240 --> 32:25.320
And then we came back in over that machine.

32:25.320 --> 32:28.180
But there are a lot of different ways

32:28.180 --> 32:29.560
you can pull these tricks off.

32:29.560 --> 32:33.560
Even if you, like me, suffer the plague of double NAT,

32:33.560 --> 32:35.600
there is a solution out there for you.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.400
And a WireGuard may be it.

32:37.400 --> 32:39.660
An SSH tunnel may be it.

32:39.660 --> 32:42.080
And the other options out there, like OpenVPN and others,

32:42.080 --> 32:44.000
are still perfectly viable.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.760
Wes and I just, we think you're going

32:45.760 --> 32:48.680
to be hearing a lot more about WireGuard

32:48.680 --> 32:50.800
over the remainder of this year and early next year.

32:50.800 --> 32:53.500
I think it's going to be a pretty big story as it gets

32:53.500 --> 32:54.720
merged into the Linux kernel.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.320
Yeah, there's already so much support, right?

32:56.320 --> 32:58.880
I mean, we were able to get it working on a Raspberry Pi.

32:58.880 --> 33:01.360
It took a little bit of doing here and there.

33:01.360 --> 33:02.580
But we got it to work.

33:02.580 --> 33:03.620
There's already devices out there

33:03.620 --> 33:05.960
that have WireGuard support, routers that you can find.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.780
So there's all kinds of gadgets.

33:07.780 --> 33:09.820
And once it's mainline, I'm sure there'll be more.

33:09.820 --> 33:12.320
We had a really brief but great opportunity

33:12.320 --> 33:14.320
to just have a quick email exchange

33:14.320 --> 33:16.200
with the developer of WireGuard as we

33:16.200 --> 33:19.640
were doing some of the preparation for this project.

33:19.640 --> 33:24.400
And it's hard to read much into just a quick couple of emails.

33:24.400 --> 33:28.080
But Jason seemed really, really accommodating

33:28.080 --> 33:32.800
to our questions, really clear spoken, and really engaged.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.360
Like, he was right on answering the stuff.

33:35.360 --> 33:38.120
He gave us really clear, concise answers to our questions.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.880
And I just sat there for a moment

33:40.880 --> 33:43.560
thinking, how awesome is this?

33:43.560 --> 33:45.840
At the end of it, I said, thank you for WireGuard.

33:45.840 --> 33:50.200
Just thank you, because it's such a great project.

33:50.200 --> 33:52.640
And then to also have him answer our questions,

33:52.640 --> 33:54.400
we're just a couple of yokel podcasters.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.320
Yeah, he's very active, giving presentations.

33:56.320 --> 33:57.940
And if you're more curious, too, there's

33:57.940 --> 34:00.240
a WireGuard mailing list that you can follow.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.440
Stay tuned for updates.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.120
Yeah, there will be updates coming.

34:03.120 --> 34:06.560
He said to us that there'll be some more significant

34:06.560 --> 34:08.840
developments over the next week or two,

34:08.840 --> 34:10.340
and to keep an eye out for that.

34:10.340 --> 34:11.000
Oh, boy.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.080
Yeah, I think you will be hearing a lot more about it.

34:13.080 --> 34:14.860
And I am elated with the setup now.

34:14.860 --> 34:18.700
It's so slick to be sitting on either LAN

34:18.700 --> 34:21.440
and be able to get access to everything on either side

34:21.440 --> 34:22.480
from any machine.

34:22.480 --> 34:23.900
And I think it's kind of just enough.

34:23.900 --> 34:26.520
WireGuard integrates so nicely with the rest of Linux.

34:26.520 --> 34:29.940
It plays nicely with IP tables, and the IP route to package,

34:29.940 --> 34:32.200
and all the modern Linux networking stuff.

34:32.200 --> 34:35.160
Plus, since you don't have some demon running somewhere,

34:35.160 --> 34:36.840
if you're not touching it all the time,

34:36.840 --> 34:38.200
it's just simpler to administer.

34:38.200 --> 34:40.540
And I think that's something that will give it staying power.

34:40.540 --> 34:42.040
So I'm glad you said that, because I

34:42.040 --> 34:45.840
think that maybe was the unspoken piece that we haven't

34:45.840 --> 34:49.080
really made clear, is what makes it so great

34:49.080 --> 34:51.560
is it's just enough VPN.

34:51.560 --> 34:54.440
And then it works with all of the other things on Linux

34:54.440 --> 34:55.960
that you're used to working with.

34:55.960 --> 34:59.320
So even an old blockhead sysadmin like me

34:59.320 --> 35:01.800
is able to work with something relatively brand new,

35:01.800 --> 35:07.180
because I understand default routes, DNS, IP tables.

35:07.180 --> 35:10.280
I get that stuff, and all of that is applicable here.

35:10.280 --> 35:11.200
That's so great.

35:11.200 --> 35:12.280
And that, you're right.

35:12.280 --> 35:13.160
It's just enough VPN.

35:13.160 --> 35:16.800
And it's that perfect Unix philosophy,

35:16.800 --> 35:18.680
where it's the right tool for the right job,

35:18.680 --> 35:20.680
and it doesn't do too much more than that.

35:20.680 --> 35:22.000
And we love it.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.320
Anyways, enough fawning, I suppose,

35:24.320 --> 35:26.840
because we have an app pic this week

35:26.840 --> 35:30.280
that Wes Payne built just for us.

35:30.280 --> 35:33.120
He set up a container even for it.

35:33.120 --> 35:37.280
It is truly something that the internet's been demanding.

35:37.280 --> 35:38.800
Spotify on the command line.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.780
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, you

35:40.780 --> 35:46.120
can have a Spotify UI written in Rust on your command line.

35:46.120 --> 35:49.640
Oh my, let's just come on now.

35:49.640 --> 35:53.520
I know, you've been laying awake at night thinking to yourself,

35:53.520 --> 35:56.360
life is great, except I can't run

35:56.360 --> 35:58.000
Spotify on the command line.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.480
So why did you have to create a entire build environment?

36:03.480 --> 36:06.160
Well, right now the release binaries

36:06.160 --> 36:09.360
they've got over on GitHub are only supported on Mac OS.

36:09.360 --> 36:11.960
And since this is Linux unplugged,

36:11.960 --> 36:13.240
that wasn't going to fly.

36:15.980 --> 36:17.160
I know you're shocked to hear this,

36:17.160 --> 36:18.900
but on the current setup on this laptop,

36:18.900 --> 36:21.840
I didn't have the Rust build chain already installed.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.560
So what do I do but pull down a container?

36:24.560 --> 36:26.760
So there's a Rust build environment container?

36:26.760 --> 36:29.240
Yeah, of course, an official one even.

36:29.240 --> 36:29.880
I love it.

36:29.880 --> 36:33.400
So then you just use Cargo, the excellent build tool,

36:33.400 --> 36:34.360
install the package.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.120
And again, since it's Rust, I just

36:36.120 --> 36:38.000
copied the built binary out of the container

36:38.000 --> 36:38.920
onto my local system.

36:38.920 --> 36:41.240
Yeah, once it's built, you're done.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.120
Good to go.

36:42.120 --> 36:43.880
Why don't they just do that then?

36:43.880 --> 36:45.380
Well, if you're developing on a Mac,

36:45.380 --> 36:47.000
you have to set up a Linux build server.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.240
And it's a little bit more work.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.920
What they had to do is they could download this container.

36:49.920 --> 36:51.400
Oh, that's a great idea.

36:51.400 --> 36:53.840
Now one little catch here, it has a great little introduction

36:53.840 --> 36:56.120
to help you go through the create an app,

36:56.120 --> 36:58.120
and you have to get the token and the secret

36:58.120 --> 36:59.440
so you can off do it.

36:59.440 --> 37:00.920
And apparently, somehow I actually

37:00.920 --> 37:02.480
signed into your account.

37:02.480 --> 37:03.200
That's amazing.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.280
Yeah.

37:04.280 --> 37:07.040
I'm also not clear in that I'm just trying this now,

37:07.040 --> 37:10.720
it seems like it's actually used to control another device.

37:10.720 --> 37:13.280
So when I loaded it up, it gave me like.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.120
You were controlling the soundboard machine.

37:15.120 --> 37:17.200
Yeah, the soundboard machine, or I can control it

37:17.200 --> 37:18.800
running on an Echo, say.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.320
Yeah, that's Spotify Connect right there, yeah.

37:21.320 --> 37:24.460
So I don't know how that happens since that's

37:24.460 --> 37:27.480
on your own machine, but it's great.

37:27.480 --> 37:30.240
And yeah, so the thing is, we were thinking,

37:30.240 --> 37:33.840
wouldn't it be fun just to have, again, some sort of device,

37:33.840 --> 37:35.920
like a Raspberry Pi or something that's just sitting around

37:35.920 --> 37:38.000
with this always going, and then you just

37:38.000 --> 37:40.720
could turn on the speakers when you want to listen or not.

37:40.720 --> 37:44.480
And I love a nice terminal user interface like this.

37:44.480 --> 37:46.960
It feels so clean, I don't have to mess with anything else,

37:46.960 --> 37:47.840
and it's right there in a terminal,

37:47.840 --> 37:49.440
which I always have open.

37:49.440 --> 37:50.520
Can I admit something?

37:50.520 --> 37:51.920
Yeah, oh, please do.

37:51.920 --> 37:57.520
To me, that terminal UI, this end curses style layout,

37:57.520 --> 38:00.120
is easier for my brain to process and understand

38:00.120 --> 38:01.600
than the actual Spotify UI.

38:01.600 --> 38:05.720
That is clean and simple and well delineated.

38:05.720 --> 38:08.120
I can understand all of that just

38:08.120 --> 38:09.320
by glancing at the screen.

38:09.320 --> 38:10.360
You know what's also great?

38:10.360 --> 38:13.520
You can use the arrow keys, or it's got VI style movements,

38:13.520 --> 38:15.160
too, right?

38:15.160 --> 38:18.560
It's fantastic.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.960
OK, all right, there you go.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.120
There you go.

38:22.120 --> 38:23.320
I'm glad you got that in there.

38:23.320 --> 38:25.480
So we'll have a link to that in the show notes,

38:25.480 --> 38:30.680
linuxunplugged.com slash 322 if you want to build it,

38:30.680 --> 38:33.360
if you have a Rust build environment and want to build it.

38:33.360 --> 38:35.320
I want to make it clear, it's not ready to go out of the box,

38:35.320 --> 38:37.040
unless you're on a freaking Mac, and then

38:37.040 --> 38:38.680
apparently it's just a brew away.

38:38.680 --> 38:40.360
What kind of, I'll tell you what.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.480
Next week on macOS Unplugged.

38:42.480 --> 38:44.280
All right, well, we're going to wrap up here,

38:44.280 --> 38:46.080
so Mr. Payne and I can go pack.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.020
If you're going to be in the San Antonio area,

38:48.020 --> 38:49.080
do come say hi to us.

38:49.080 --> 38:50.400
Otherwise, we're back next week.

38:50.400 --> 38:51.520
We're just down there for the weekend,

38:51.520 --> 38:54.040
so it doesn't really impact the show production at all,

38:54.040 --> 38:56.840
other than Wes won't be doing headlines.

38:56.840 --> 38:58.440
No, we've got some fill-in, so.

38:58.440 --> 38:59.560
And I'm not doing headlines.

38:59.560 --> 39:00.080
No.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.240
Neither one of us are doing headlines for the rest of the week.

39:01.240 --> 39:02.840
We're done for the week, woo-hoo.

39:02.840 --> 39:05.000
If you haven't checked out the new daily podcast,

39:05.000 --> 39:09.840
linuxheadlines.show, it is a breakdown of the day's news

39:09.840 --> 39:12.360
events at Linux and open source in under three minutes.

39:12.360 --> 39:14.360
Yeah, if you don't want to go troll hacker news

39:14.360 --> 39:16.720
and find out all the things that are happening in the world,

39:16.720 --> 39:17.600
we'll do it for you.

39:17.600 --> 39:21.080
There is a really fair amount of research analysis

39:21.080 --> 39:22.000
that goes into that.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.600
We have a team member, and that is their job.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.120
Yeah, we're tracking trends, making

39:26.120 --> 39:27.880
sure we follow up on things.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.720
It's not one of our on-air people.

39:29.720 --> 39:32.080
It's just somebody who's dedicated to that task

39:32.080 --> 39:35.880
and puts a lot of work and research into the headline show.

39:35.880 --> 39:37.160
Our staff in the newsroom.

39:37.160 --> 39:40.560
That's right, we have a newsroom now.

39:40.560 --> 39:44.000
All right, so we do this show live like next week over jblive.tv.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
We do it on a Tuesday.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.200
We'd love to have you here.

39:46.200 --> 39:47.120
Oh, please join us.

39:47.120 --> 39:49.120
Yeah, we've got the virtual lug you can hang out in.

39:49.120 --> 39:52.080
We've got the chat room, or you can just sit back and watch.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.360
But there's a lot more show.

39:53.360 --> 39:55.520
There's probably about an hour or more

39:55.520 --> 39:58.320
show if you join us live at the beginning and at the end.

39:58.320 --> 40:01.160
jblive.tv, Tuesday, 2 PM Pacific.

40:01.160 --> 40:03.080
Or get it converted at jubilabroadcast.com.

40:03.080 --> 40:05.960
Or you want audio only, jblive.stream.

40:05.960 --> 40:06.880
That's right.

40:06.880 --> 40:09.400
Got to mention, too, that's also a really nice low latency

40:09.400 --> 40:11.480
way to listen, jblive.stream.

40:11.480 --> 40:14.040
Go check out West, techsnap.systems.

40:14.040 --> 40:16.800
I'm at Chris Elias, the network at Jupiter Signal.

40:16.800 --> 40:20.800
Go find the Ubuntu podcast, too, ubuntupodcast.org.

40:20.800 --> 40:21.880
Yeah, do that.

40:21.880 --> 40:24.200
And go get Mr. Cheesy at Cheese Bacon.

40:24.200 --> 40:25.040
That's right.

40:25.040 --> 40:25.960
All right, everybody.

40:25.960 --> 40:26.640
See you next Tuesday.

40:26.640 --> 40:52.200
Thanks for watching.

40:56.640 --> 41:05.640
Minimac, you were pointing out that Spotify app looks a lot like another famous command

41:05.640 --> 41:06.640
line music app.

41:06.640 --> 41:09.840
Well, it was Cheese Bacon that pointed that out, but I'm using Seamus.

41:09.840 --> 41:10.840
Oh yeah, okay.

41:10.840 --> 41:16.480
It is much easier for my muscle memory to look for songs because just slash and then

41:16.480 --> 41:19.280
you do some letters and then you get the songs you want.

41:19.280 --> 41:20.280
That's so nice.

41:20.280 --> 41:21.280
It's so easy.

41:21.280 --> 41:24.020
It is so easy and it's so fast, you know?

41:24.020 --> 41:25.800
Have we mentioned Seamus before on the show?

41:25.800 --> 41:26.800
I don't know that we have.

41:26.800 --> 41:28.300
I guess you did.

41:28.300 --> 41:30.040
I'm going to put a bonus link in.

41:30.040 --> 41:37.600
You know, you even have GTK3 integration when it comes to notification and everything.

41:37.600 --> 41:44.160
You can just launch Seamus in a terminal and then you get notifications for song change

41:44.160 --> 41:45.160
and everything.

41:45.160 --> 41:46.160
I'm putting a link to that in the show notes.

41:46.160 --> 41:47.160
That looks great.

41:47.160 --> 41:51.840
By the way, I have a question about that Spotify tree.

41:51.840 --> 41:55.640
Do you have to be registered for that or can you just use it later?

41:55.640 --> 42:00.640
And do you have all the ads still or you got to have a token, so you have to have an account.

42:00.640 --> 42:03.200
Yeah, I had to go create like a new client.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.200
Yeah.

42:04.200 --> 42:05.200
Yeah.

42:05.200 --> 42:08.040
And I think the ads are added in line to the audio stream itself.

42:08.040 --> 42:09.040
Oh, okay.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.040
I see.

42:10.040 --> 42:11.040
Mm hmm.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.040
Mm hmm.

42:12.040 --> 42:13.040
That's how they get you.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.560
Seamus is definitely an app pick.

42:14.560 --> 42:19.320
You have to look if you just have on because Seamus is really great.

42:19.320 --> 42:25.080
I didn't mention this in the show, but I've kind of in the last three weeks, four weeks

42:25.080 --> 42:29.800
kind of started reevaluating how I'm doing my music and I think I'm going to do more

42:29.800 --> 42:30.800
local music.

42:30.800 --> 42:31.800
What?

42:31.800 --> 42:32.800
More all or do it.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.680
I'm going to try to just do all flack local music.

42:34.680 --> 42:35.680
All flack even?

42:35.680 --> 42:37.600
If I'm going to go local, right?

42:37.600 --> 42:40.960
I've got a couple of different areas where I can, I have speakers where I can really

42:40.960 --> 42:41.960
tell the difference.

42:41.960 --> 42:45.400
And I'm like, well, if I've got two areas that I spend a fair, one of them is my car

42:45.400 --> 42:48.440
and I spend a lot of time in my car, I can really hear the difference in the car speaker

42:48.440 --> 42:49.440
system.

42:49.440 --> 42:50.440
So why not?

42:50.440 --> 42:51.440
Why not?

42:51.440 --> 42:52.440
Right.

42:52.440 --> 42:53.440
And I'm just going to, I'm not going to rush.

42:53.440 --> 42:54.440
I'm just going to take my time.

42:54.440 --> 42:56.000
I'm going to listen to music, not waste a bunch of disk space.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.160
Cause really there's like a, you know, you have a hybrid approach.

42:58.160 --> 43:01.200
You have a streaming plan account and you have access to all this cloud music.

43:01.200 --> 43:03.600
So you just start collecting the things that really matter to you.

43:03.600 --> 43:05.440
I blame Alex.

43:05.440 --> 43:07.360
You know, all this self hosted stuff.

43:07.360 --> 43:08.840
He's really got me going there.

43:08.840 --> 43:12.300
And now I'm loving it in the RV cause I can, I can take all this stuff with me offline

43:12.300 --> 43:13.300
wherever I go.

43:13.300 --> 43:15.480
You're no longer hooked on the cloud.

43:15.480 --> 43:18.200
I am so jazzed about self hosting right now.

43:18.200 --> 43:20.480
This perfect time to launch a self hosted show.

43:20.480 --> 43:21.480
Tell you what.

43:21.480 --> 43:27.360
On speakers, have you guys noticed that the, uh, uh, Alexa devices favorite distribution

43:27.360 --> 43:30.120
is we want to, do you guys see that this week?

43:30.120 --> 43:31.120
Yeah.

43:31.120 --> 43:32.120
What was that?

43:32.120 --> 43:33.120
I saw the headline go by, but what does that mean?

43:33.120 --> 43:35.720
Well, just ask Alexa what his favorite operating system is.

43:35.720 --> 43:36.720
All right.

43:36.720 --> 43:37.720
Hold on.

43:37.720 --> 43:38.720
We, okay.

43:38.720 --> 43:39.720
You keep getting a trigger.

43:39.720 --> 43:40.720
You keep saying, you want me to do it?

43:40.720 --> 43:41.720
I'll do it right now.

43:41.720 --> 43:42.720
Do it right now.

43:42.720 --> 43:43.720
Alexa, what's your favorite operating system?

43:43.720 --> 43:44.720
I'm glad you asked.

43:44.720 --> 43:45.720
It's all about windows.

43:45.720 --> 43:46.720
What?

43:46.720 --> 43:47.720
What?

43:47.720 --> 43:49.280
She said it's all about windows, dude.

43:49.280 --> 43:51.160
I just asked her and she said it's all about windows.

43:51.160 --> 43:52.160
How dare she?

43:52.160 --> 43:53.160
Did they change it already?

43:53.160 --> 43:54.560
Did they already change it?

43:54.560 --> 43:55.560
That's too funny.

43:55.560 --> 43:56.560
I'll screw again.

43:56.560 --> 43:57.560
All right.

43:57.560 --> 43:58.560
Okay.

43:58.560 --> 43:59.560
I'm going to ask her again.

43:59.560 --> 44:00.560
You ready?

44:00.560 --> 44:02.040
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm sorry for everybody at home if I'm triggering your,

44:02.040 --> 44:07.400
uh, your echo devices here, Alexa, what's your favorite operating system?

44:07.400 --> 44:08.400
Definitely windows.

44:08.400 --> 44:09.400
Oh man.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.400
She's picking up all the windows.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.400
You're running on your network there.

44:11.400 --> 44:12.400
That's what's going on.

44:12.400 --> 44:16.040
You know, what's interesting is she shortened the answer to it was a tighter answer this

44:16.040 --> 44:17.040
time.

44:17.040 --> 44:18.840
I don't want to answer this again.

44:18.840 --> 44:19.840
Holy crap.

44:19.840 --> 44:22.120
What's going on there, Alexa?

44:22.120 --> 44:23.960
What's your favorite operating system?

44:23.960 --> 44:26.320
Definitely Ubuntu.

44:26.320 --> 44:27.320
What the hell?

44:27.320 --> 44:28.320
Interesting.

44:28.320 --> 44:31.720
That'll be on account of all the Ubuntu I'm running on my network and all the windows

44:31.720 --> 44:33.000
you're running on yours.

44:33.000 --> 44:37.400
There's probably never been a windows box on this network in the lifetime of that echo

44:37.400 --> 44:38.400
device.

44:38.400 --> 44:39.400
No, no.

44:39.400 --> 44:40.400
It's reactOS.

44:40.400 --> 44:41.400
It's just getting confused.

44:41.400 --> 44:42.400
It's the country.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.200
It's the country you live in.

44:44.200 --> 44:45.760
You're in the windows country.

44:45.760 --> 44:48.960
Oh, it's cause we're in Washington and it knows.

44:48.960 --> 44:49.960
That's what I thought.

44:49.960 --> 44:50.960
Yeah.

44:50.960 --> 44:51.960
We're in Redmond town.

44:51.960 --> 44:53.680
I don't know if all those previous tweets were UK based.

44:53.680 --> 44:56.280
Do we have any Cupertino based friends here to check in?

44:56.280 --> 44:57.280
Yeah.

44:57.280 --> 45:01.080
Has anybody else got a lady tube near them that isn't in Washington that could ask?

45:01.080 --> 45:03.320
Because somebody in the chat room asked you something.

45:03.320 --> 45:07.720
Because what's not only weird about it to me, it's weird that she changes the answer.

45:07.720 --> 45:12.040
That's something I've noticed they're doing more and more is she'll give you a long answer

45:12.040 --> 45:13.040
and then she'll give you a short answer.

45:13.040 --> 45:17.840
And then somehow if she thinks you're not very busy, she'll be like, by the way, sometimes

45:17.840 --> 45:19.360
she does it at the wrong time.

45:19.360 --> 45:23.040
By the way, did you know that and then she'll tell you about something else that they can

45:23.040 --> 45:24.520
do now that they've added?

45:24.520 --> 45:25.520
Yeah.

45:25.520 --> 45:26.520
It's very clever.

45:26.520 --> 45:27.520
It's very clever.

45:27.520 --> 45:35.280
I noticed that our family was barking orders at the echo and I felt a bit bad about that

45:35.280 --> 45:37.080
because it felt rude.

45:37.080 --> 45:45.660
So I started being polite and occasionally it acknowledges your politeness, which is

45:45.660 --> 45:48.240
also a little bit creepy, but quite clever.

45:48.240 --> 45:49.240
Like a little.

45:49.240 --> 45:50.240
You're welcome.

45:50.240 --> 45:51.240
Yeah.

45:51.240 --> 45:52.240
Oh, it's no problem.

45:52.240 --> 45:53.240
Isn't that something?

45:53.240 --> 45:54.240
It's kind of nice.

45:54.240 --> 45:57.480
I mean, I suppose it's all trying to increase engagement and the more human it feels, the

45:57.480 --> 45:59.520
easier it is to talk to and the more you'll talk to it.

45:59.520 --> 46:00.520
Ding.

46:00.520 --> 46:01.520
Yep.

46:01.520 --> 46:02.520
Absolutely.

46:02.520 --> 46:03.520
They're aggressive.

46:03.520 --> 46:05.480
The echo team is aggressive with these features.

46:05.480 --> 46:09.400
Google is a little bit slower and Apple is glacial.

46:09.400 --> 46:16.840
I am flabbergasted that the other lady tubes haven't ripped off whisper mode.

46:16.840 --> 46:19.040
If you have an echo, you've got to turn on whisper mode.

46:19.040 --> 46:23.920
It's the best thing for night times because if you whisper to it, she automatically recognizes

46:23.920 --> 46:27.160
that you're whispering and whispers the responses back to you.

46:27.160 --> 46:28.160
That's so smart.

46:28.160 --> 46:29.160
Super clever.

46:29.160 --> 46:31.040
And there's a lot of little things like that.

46:31.040 --> 46:35.960
Like now they have celebrity voices like Samuel Jackson and they have like you can play with

46:35.960 --> 46:36.960
Jimmy Fallon.

46:36.960 --> 46:39.640
I assume there's a Chris Fisher voice in the works.

46:39.640 --> 46:43.920
Nobody is making a wiretap device more appealing than Amazon these days.

46:43.920 --> 46:46.040
I tell you what.

46:46.040 --> 46:47.040
And it can order you packages.

46:47.040 --> 46:49.040
Oh yeah, that too.

46:49.040 --> 47:09.120
Oh man, I wish my craft would have been a thing.
