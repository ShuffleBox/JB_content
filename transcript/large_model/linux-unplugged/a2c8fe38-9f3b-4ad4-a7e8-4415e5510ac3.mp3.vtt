WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
Wes, it actually happened? We all made it to Denver.

00:02.960 --> 00:04.360
I wasn't sure we would.

00:04.360 --> 00:06.520
I wasn't sure you would actually, ya terrorist.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.560
What happened? You got held up in security.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.900
Oh boy, yes, it was an early flight,

00:10.900 --> 00:14.020
let's say boarding at 4.35 a.m.

00:14.020 --> 00:15.640
I get to the airport, I'm walking to my gate,

00:15.640 --> 00:17.920
I got a TSA pre-check, not too worried,

00:17.920 --> 00:20.320
except I see a giant crowd.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.160
Uh-oh.

00:21.160 --> 00:22.000
I did not budget for this.

00:22.000 --> 00:22.920
Not at four in the morning.

00:22.920 --> 00:25.160
No, right, I checked the app and it said there was no line

00:25.160 --> 00:27.000
like five minutes or less, okay.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.240
Okay, no, no, that's just a bunch of international people

00:30.240 --> 00:31.360
waiting for their own flight,

00:31.360 --> 00:32.760
and for whatever reason, the security check

00:32.760 --> 00:35.880
is passed all of these people with their bags.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.560
I'm going through lines, going through,

00:38.560 --> 00:40.320
and I decided to bring a microphone.

00:40.320 --> 00:41.880
You know, we did the show.

00:41.880 --> 00:42.720
Yep.

00:42.720 --> 00:43.920
We needed to do the show.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.040
Are we using that mic right now?

00:45.040 --> 00:45.880
I'm using that mic right now.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.240
Okay, all right, so it may have been worth it.

00:47.240 --> 00:48.680
I got it through.

00:48.680 --> 00:51.100
I anticipated knowing from your experiences

00:51.100 --> 00:52.380
that there was gonna be a little bit of trouble

00:52.380 --> 00:54.880
with the old TSA and their scanners.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.040
It just happens that the RE320

00:57.040 --> 01:00.240
kind of looks like a pipe bomb on the x-ray.

01:00.240 --> 01:01.440
So here I am thinking about that.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.320
You know, I know that's totally fine.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.840
So I expect this.

01:04.840 --> 01:06.400
I see them start looking at my bag

01:06.400 --> 01:07.400
and I hear them debating.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.480
Like one of them thinks part of the stand

01:09.480 --> 01:10.840
is an extendable baton.

01:10.840 --> 01:11.900
So they're kind of debating,

01:11.900 --> 01:14.560
but another of the TSA agents thinks,

01:14.560 --> 01:16.600
no, no, that's a microphone, that's a microphone.

01:16.600 --> 01:17.960
So they're like betting each other.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.740
Yeah, and then they come over to grab the bag

01:19.740 --> 01:21.880
and I'm like, yeah, yeah, it's a microphone.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.720
She's like, oh, I knew it.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.200
Tells me, you know, you gotta wait for your other bags.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.480
I'll be over here looking for things.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.160
Now, I knew this might happen.

01:28.160 --> 01:31.200
So the microphone right at the top of my bag.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.160
Oh, good thinking.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.880
Turns out though, they're also very interested

01:34.880 --> 01:38.120
in the very dense pieces of the stand.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.000
I didn't think about that.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.340
They're just dumb pieces of metal, right?

01:40.340 --> 01:41.600
There's no complicated electronics.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.480
There's no electronics at all.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.400
All right, so they're rooting around.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.400
I see she's kind of looking through my bags

01:48.400 --> 01:50.000
and eventually gets to the bottom

01:50.000 --> 01:52.280
where the big, heavy base of the stand is,

01:52.280 --> 01:54.440
pulls that out, checks it.

01:54.440 --> 01:55.520
I thought that'd be it, but no,

01:55.520 --> 01:56.720
she keeps looking, keeps looking.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.360
And that's because there's this little extended bit

01:58.360 --> 02:01.440
that actually joins from the microphone to the stand part.

02:01.440 --> 02:02.740
I mean, it is the stand, right?

02:02.740 --> 02:03.580
But what could it be?

02:03.580 --> 02:05.520
It looks so weird on the x-ray.

02:05.520 --> 02:06.960
And I'm trying to be helpful.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.720
Oh, I think I rolled that up.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.360
I think I rolled that up in a shirt.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.200
And she's like, oh, okay.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.840
You know, she offers me to come closer

02:12.840 --> 02:15.600
and like, you know, help look for this thing.

02:15.600 --> 02:16.880
She gets a look of confidence.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.180
Oh, I think I found it.

02:18.180 --> 02:20.200
She reaches in to pull it up.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.160
It's wrapped in my underwear.

02:23.160 --> 02:24.160
Hello friends.

02:24.160 --> 02:29.160
And welcome to your weekly Linux talk show.

02:33.480 --> 02:34.320
My name is Chris.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.160
My name is Wes.

02:35.160 --> 02:36.220
Hello, Wes.

02:36.220 --> 02:39.160
Yes, we are live from a very toasty sound booth

02:39.160 --> 02:42.560
at System76 in Denver, Colorado.

02:42.560 --> 02:46.400
And we have a very special show coming up for you today.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.600
Old and new friends are joining us here in the booth

02:49.600 --> 02:51.840
to chat about various different things.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.060
It's gonna be a great show.

02:53.060 --> 02:54.700
I can't wait to get into it.

02:54.700 --> 02:56.120
I wanna say thank you to a Cloud Guru

02:56.120 --> 02:57.200
for sponsoring this episode.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.080
They are the leader in learning for the cloud, Linux,

02:59.080 --> 03:00.160
and other modern tech skills.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.600
Hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

03:02.600 --> 03:07.240
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.940
Yeah, so just like we said, coming up on the show today,

03:09.940 --> 03:11.760
it's a totally different format.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.720
We made the trek out here

03:14.720 --> 03:17.900
and we're gonna chat with our friends about all of that.

03:17.900 --> 03:19.660
There is so much to get into

03:19.660 --> 03:22.640
that we're gonna kinda do this a little bit differently.

03:22.640 --> 03:23.880
So right here at the top,

03:23.880 --> 03:26.360
I wanna say thank you to our friends at Linode,

03:26.360 --> 03:29.080
at linode.com slash unplugged.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.340
You go there to get $100 in 60-day credit

03:31.340 --> 03:33.760
on your new account and you also support the show.

03:33.760 --> 03:34.800
It's a way of letting Linode know,

03:34.800 --> 03:36.860
hey, I heard about this here service

03:36.860 --> 03:38.700
on that Linux Unplugged podcast.

03:38.700 --> 03:39.960
That was worth your time.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.380
That was worth your efforts to sponsor them.

03:42.380 --> 03:44.160
So we appreciate you doing that as well.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.800
Linode is our hosting provider as well,

03:45.800 --> 03:47.960
so we enthusiastically recommend them.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.280
Everything we've built in the last couple of years

03:50.280 --> 03:51.720
has been on Linode.

03:51.720 --> 03:54.520
And this week, right now as we are here,

03:54.520 --> 03:57.660
marks the very prime moment in negotiations

03:57.660 --> 03:59.480
before Jupiter Broadcasting with Independent.

03:59.480 --> 04:02.520
We are one week away from the year anniversary

04:02.520 --> 04:05.240
and Linode was one of the very first companies on board

04:05.240 --> 04:07.040
helping us go independent.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.360
When I contacted them,

04:08.360 --> 04:10.540
they were enthusiastic about joining us

04:10.540 --> 04:12.540
and that has held true the entire time.

04:12.540 --> 04:14.840
When I reached out to them

04:14.840 --> 04:16.960
and started brainstorming about this road trip,

04:16.960 --> 04:18.940
I expected to really kind of have to convince them

04:18.940 --> 04:22.240
of the value and they were 100% on board.

04:22.240 --> 04:25.160
They got designers involved, they got web people involved,

04:25.160 --> 04:26.960
they got people on their marketing crew involved

04:26.960 --> 04:29.500
so we can do giveaways and all kinds of stuff.

04:29.500 --> 04:32.240
They really enthusiastically embraced the community

04:32.240 --> 04:34.160
and that's because they started there.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.440
In 2003, they got into cloud computing

04:36.440 --> 04:38.800
before it was called that because they saw the features

04:38.800 --> 04:40.520
that were landing in Linux itself.

04:40.520 --> 04:43.080
They were developers, they were geeks using this stuff

04:43.080 --> 04:46.480
and they realized there was a way to build out Linux at scale

04:46.480 --> 04:48.140
like nobody had done before.

04:48.140 --> 04:50.720
Now, you flash forward 18 years later,

04:50.720 --> 04:53.720
yeah, yeah, Linode's old enough to vote now,

04:53.720 --> 04:56.920
you fast forward 18 years and they have refined

04:56.920 --> 04:59.500
and focused that strategy to a T.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.080
It is so impressive what they can do

05:01.080 --> 05:03.120
between the dashboard, the performance,

05:03.120 --> 05:05.460
11 data centers around the world

05:05.460 --> 05:07.280
and they have a lot of options for those of you

05:07.280 --> 05:09.360
who maybe have never set up a server before.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.960
One click deployments from their marketplace,

05:11.960 --> 05:14.400
easy tutorials and guides and they're always working

05:14.400 --> 05:16.640
with people out in the community to create videos

05:16.640 --> 05:18.280
and tutorials to help you as well.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.560
But you have to get started, you have to go try it yourself,

05:20.560 --> 05:22.520
you have to see it with your own eyeballs.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.840
Go hook your peepers on it by going to linode.com

05:24.840 --> 05:27.840
slash unplugged, get that $100 for your new account

05:27.840 --> 05:29.680
and try this stuff out.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.000
That's how you learn, that's how you experience something,

05:32.000 --> 05:33.800
go build something, go try something,

05:33.800 --> 05:35.200
maybe go performance test your network

05:35.200 --> 05:36.800
because they've got crazy fast servers

05:36.800 --> 05:38.960
and you can really, really push things.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.040
There's a lot of ways and a lot of different companies

05:41.040 --> 05:45.000
to host something, there's a thousand options out there.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.140
But Linode strikes the balance between performance,

05:48.140 --> 05:51.000
price, the best customer service out there

05:51.000 --> 05:52.600
and their community support.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.360
So go shop local, support the show

05:54.360 --> 05:57.280
and go to linode.com slash unplugged.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.800
Well, I just arrived in Denver today,

06:02.800 --> 06:05.080
but Brent, you've been journeying with Chris

06:05.080 --> 06:08.840
and really the whole clan this entire time.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.080
I think you need to catch me up.

06:10.080 --> 06:11.360
Where do we start, Chris?

06:11.360 --> 06:12.640
Well, you're Uncle Brent now.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.560
Well, that's true, I think just yesterday,

06:15.560 --> 06:17.500
Levi confirmed that status.

06:19.080 --> 06:23.860
I've been sleeping on the sofa in Lady Jupiter, the RV,

06:23.860 --> 06:25.960
and yesterday I wasn't there

06:25.960 --> 06:27.960
and Levi wouldn't have any of it.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.980
Yeah, he noticed, he protested,

06:29.980 --> 06:32.740
he was searching the whole RV nonstop.

06:32.740 --> 06:36.000
I mean, Brent's been with us for 2,000 miles,

06:36.000 --> 06:37.960
about I think a little over.

06:37.960 --> 06:38.800
How many states is that?

06:38.800 --> 06:39.640
Something like that.

06:39.640 --> 06:42.160
So we didn't count, but I went to a bunch of states

06:42.160 --> 06:45.440
that I didn't realize we were going to be going through.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.880
One of those was Wyoming, which was beautiful.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.160
I really appreciate that.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.680
We kind of cruised through most of the,

06:51.680 --> 06:53.840
I guess, southern part of Wyoming

06:53.840 --> 06:56.040
and then we ended up in Nebraska as well

06:56.040 --> 06:58.560
and I had no idea we were gonna end up there,

06:58.560 --> 07:01.360
so I've added that to my list of experiences

07:01.360 --> 07:03.360
and we found a beautiful spot to stay there

07:03.360 --> 07:05.180
and watch the stars and the sunset.

07:05.180 --> 07:06.800
It was your first time to Utah as well, right?

07:06.800 --> 07:07.640
You're right.

07:07.640 --> 07:12.640
Yeah, so we've done Idaho, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming,

07:12.840 --> 07:14.300
and Nebraska.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.140
Washington.

07:15.140 --> 07:19.040
Of course, Washington, and then we came down

07:19.040 --> 07:22.680
Highway 76 into Denver, which was rough as hell

07:22.680 --> 07:24.200
on the rig, really bad.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.400
I mean, that must be a big new part of this.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.480
Obviously, Brent, you kind of travel all over.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.040
Who knows where you are at any one point,

07:30.040 --> 07:33.080
but I don't know if you've traveled exactly this way before.

07:33.080 --> 07:36.800
I have not, and I will say it's my first

07:36.800 --> 07:40.560
sort of somewhat cross-America road trip.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.160
Typically, I'm sort of jetting in somewhere

07:43.160 --> 07:44.720
and having all these great experiences,

07:44.720 --> 07:46.800
but this time, the trip was the experience.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.000
This time, you saw the real America, didn't you?

07:49.000 --> 07:49.840
Yeah.

07:49.840 --> 07:50.760
Hot holes and all.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.520
The stuff that's outside the cities

07:52.520 --> 07:56.680
that just goes on and on and on forever,

07:56.680 --> 07:59.280
and we had different challenges to solve along the way,

07:59.280 --> 08:00.960
generally related to the temperature.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.880
That was always intense,

08:03.880 --> 08:06.240
and Brent just became part of the crew.

08:06.240 --> 08:08.880
We just kind of, we treat it like a low-key submarine

08:08.880 --> 08:11.040
kind of earth vessel is what we do,

08:11.040 --> 08:13.840
because when those slides are in, it's a tight space.

08:13.840 --> 08:14.680
Pressurizing.

08:14.680 --> 08:17.200
Yeah, and there's things, there's certain operations

08:17.200 --> 08:18.760
to cool things down,

08:18.760 --> 08:21.560
and just even moving through the hallway in the RV

08:21.560 --> 08:23.160
is kind of a system you have to adopt.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.000
Yeah, really.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.840
I mean, okay, so there's the adults,

08:25.840 --> 08:28.280
but then there's the children and the dog,

08:28.280 --> 08:30.640
and they're kind of all climbing all over the place.

08:30.640 --> 08:34.000
And we're trying to do the shows on the road,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
which Brent was able to join me for a couple of them

08:36.000 --> 08:38.560
and watch me scramble to get technical problems solved

08:38.560 --> 08:39.760
at the last minute.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.960
Oh, yes, that guest appearance

08:41.960 --> 08:43.480
in the most recent self-hosted.

08:43.480 --> 08:44.880
Yep, yep, yep.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.080
So what, I don't know, Brent,

08:46.080 --> 08:48.400
what's your big takeaway from the trip?

08:48.400 --> 08:51.560
Is this a crazy way to get to places and do shows?

08:51.560 --> 08:53.720
Because in some ways, it's kind of torture.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.120
I mean, in some ways, it's very enjoyable.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.720
I think it's a big balance.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.960
The number one thing that stands out for me, actually,

08:58.960 --> 09:03.160
I think would be how wonderful your family is.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.720
I'm just gonna put that out there.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.320
Aw, geez.

09:06.320 --> 09:09.640
You know, I knew that before, but now I really feel that.

09:09.640 --> 09:10.800
Gonna make me blush, Brent.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.720
No.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.040
Blush on a podcast.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.200
But it's true.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.800
You were kind to say, hey, my kids are coming on the trip

09:17.800 --> 09:19.800
now, are you sure you still wanna,

09:19.800 --> 09:21.760
it's okay if you can back out?

09:21.760 --> 09:24.240
And I thought, no, no, this is gonna be great.

09:24.240 --> 09:27.720
And it's even been better than I've expected.

09:27.720 --> 09:28.840
Aw, that's nice to hear.

09:28.840 --> 09:29.800
I mean, the kids love you.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.040
Which kid are you taking back with you?

09:32.040 --> 09:32.880
Levi.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.240
Yeah, no kidding, right?

09:34.240 --> 09:35.600
I think some of my favorite moments

09:35.600 --> 09:37.920
were watching you fight with the kids in the pool.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.160
Pool battles for hours.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.120
I think I lost that one.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.560
Everybody does, we all lose.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.320
And then there was the pool noodle battle

09:44.320 --> 09:45.920
out at the golf course.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.400
Well, there was no pool at the golf course,

09:47.400 --> 09:48.280
so we just made it work.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.480
Yeah, just the noodles.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.440
That was a lot of fun.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.760
And it was great to have you on board

09:51.760 --> 09:53.400
to help solve problems as they came up.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.880
Of course, we had all kinds of little challenges

09:55.880 --> 09:56.720
here and there.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.840
And that really, I think, is the quintessential thing

09:58.840 --> 10:02.960
about a road trip is the bad moments actually matter, too,

10:02.960 --> 10:05.800
because that's when we kind of come together

10:05.800 --> 10:09.240
and have to problem solve and get outside our comfort zone.

10:09.240 --> 10:12.160
And that happens both with relationships

10:12.160 --> 10:14.680
in an emotional way, but also in a technical way.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.600
And then we're problem solving driving, too.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.920
You and I were tandem driving, so you were chasing us.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.040
And we're solving traffic issues,

10:21.040 --> 10:22.960
and we're solving all those kinds of problems

10:22.960 --> 10:23.880
at the same time, too.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.920
And that's a fun way to drive, especially

10:25.920 --> 10:26.920
if you enjoy driving.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.220
It's a different kind of driving that you don't normally

10:29.220 --> 10:31.760
get to do where you're driving in twos, basically, in pairs.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.440
I mean, yeah, you're a team, and you're

10:33.440 --> 10:36.160
sort of actively scouting out and reacting to a new area

10:36.160 --> 10:37.680
you've never been to.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.240
And there was some times where Brent would scout for us

10:40.240 --> 10:41.160
or that kind of stuff.

10:41.160 --> 10:41.920
It was great.

10:41.920 --> 10:44.440
I was taking possession of lanes, as well,

10:44.440 --> 10:46.240
because I could tell, oh, I know we're

10:46.240 --> 10:47.640
going to need to do this soon.

10:47.640 --> 10:48.360
And I knew.

10:48.360 --> 10:49.320
I would look in my mirror and see

10:49.320 --> 10:51.840
you getting over preemptively from, attaboy, Brent.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.720
Yeah, because I could tell you need some space in that thing.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.280
You do, don't you?

10:56.280 --> 11:00.000
Man, so now we part ways here in Denver.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.920
It's an adjustment, because Brent's no longer on board.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.520
You're losing one of your own.

11:04.520 --> 11:07.040
Yeah, and the family is having to adjust to it.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.720
The kids don't like it.

11:08.720 --> 11:09.760
Levi doesn't like it.

11:09.760 --> 11:13.600
There's just always like, thank god.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.880
There's always that sense of loss.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.920
You have to acknowledge the change in your crew.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.280
Yeah, yeah.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.400
And it was fun, because Brent and I, we

11:21.400 --> 11:24.240
recorded recaps and clips along the way of the trip

11:24.240 --> 11:25.680
while memories were fresh.

11:25.680 --> 11:28.240
And then we would organize and store those up

11:28.240 --> 11:29.400
on our Nextcloud instance.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.880
And so we're going to put together, after the trip,

11:31.880 --> 11:35.080
a couple of episodes of the experience itself,

11:35.080 --> 11:36.560
the best and worst moments.

11:36.560 --> 11:37.840
And there are some.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.360
Yeah, I think we're going to do some technical highlights,

11:40.360 --> 11:41.080
some of the equipment.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.480
Some of the tech we used for the trip and all of that.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.720
So that'll all be coming pretty soon.

11:45.720 --> 11:47.960
And we'll have more information about the feeds for that

11:47.960 --> 11:48.720
and all of that.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.720
But Brent, it's going to be sad to see you go.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.300
I'm glad we still have a few days in Denver before we part

11:54.300 --> 11:54.640
our ways.

11:54.640 --> 11:55.160
It's true.

11:55.160 --> 11:58.160
I think I might see you in Colorado Springs at some point

11:58.160 --> 11:59.680
before you head south, right?

11:59.680 --> 12:00.280
Yep.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.160
Then I head down after Colorado Springs.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.640
We're going to leave Denver.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.360
We'll do another round of shows from Colorado Springs

12:06.360 --> 12:08.200
and do some micro meetups there.

12:08.200 --> 12:12.000
And then I'm off to Tucson, kind of off the books,

12:12.000 --> 12:15.400
to go get Lady Joops' slide finally fixed.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.520
Oh, that's the other thing.

12:16.520 --> 12:17.160
Oh, yeah.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.360
Brent had to do this entire trip with the entire family

12:19.360 --> 12:20.840
with a broken living room slide.

12:20.840 --> 12:21.880
We didn't have a living room slide.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.840
This is the first time I saw it this morning.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.760
And I'm used to seeing Joops in her full glory slides out,

12:26.760 --> 12:28.000
you know, set up to party.

12:28.000 --> 12:28.560
Tight.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.080
It's, yeah, it's a bit different.

12:30.080 --> 12:30.920
It's tight.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.800
It's, you know, it's the-

12:32.800 --> 12:34.000
Your living room is gone.

12:34.000 --> 12:34.640
Yeah.

12:34.640 --> 12:35.960
Yeah, the whole room is gone.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.760
And when you have an extra person on board,

12:37.760 --> 12:39.480
you kind of need that.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.920
So congratulations to you for not only surviving,

12:41.920 --> 12:43.280
but thriving on the road trip.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.000
Well, thank you.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.560
It was such a treat to be a part of it.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.920
Mr. Cheese Bacon, welcome back to the show, buddy.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.320
Hey, thanks for having me, guys.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.400
It's great to be back here.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.080
And now an employee at System 76.

12:54.080 --> 12:54.360
Yeah.

12:54.360 --> 12:55.680
So that's pretty great.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.600
Yeah, really, we're back here.

12:57.600 --> 12:58.520
Yeah.

12:58.520 --> 13:01.120
Yeah, it's kind of awesome that the first time we got

13:01.120 --> 13:02.880
to come back in two years, you're now here.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.360
And, you know, we get to hang out.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.040
Yeah, absolutely.

13:05.040 --> 13:06.120
Well, it's great to see you guys,

13:06.120 --> 13:08.360
you know, especially after the pandemic and everything.

13:08.360 --> 13:11.400
And, you know, the stress and things

13:11.400 --> 13:14.320
that go around when, you know, go on when you can't kind of

13:14.320 --> 13:16.200
cohabitate and meet space together.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.680
So it's finally nice to be back together all

13:19.680 --> 13:22.320
vaxxed up and sitting in this hot box.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.360
And having fun, though.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.600
Having a lot of fun.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.360
Yeah, after this, we're going to all run over

13:26.360 --> 13:27.840
to the JB AirBB.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.240
And, you know, I don't know what's going to happen.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.680
Probably something crazy like naps.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.320
Naps?

13:32.320 --> 13:34.400
I think a big cuddle puddle in the living room, right?

13:34.400 --> 13:35.560
Yeah, that's possible.

13:35.560 --> 13:37.040
I think first, there's going to be lunch.

13:37.040 --> 13:37.560
Yes.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.040
So lunch, and then likely naps after lunch.

13:40.040 --> 13:40.520
Yeah.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.480
Especially if it's a high carb lunch.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.720
Maybe we get some brats for lunch.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.280
I mean, that's the thing, when you visit a place

13:45.280 --> 13:46.760
and if there's a cheese bacon there,

13:46.760 --> 13:49.000
you're going to find some tasty eats.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.360
Yeah, you know cheese is making sure, like, we only

13:51.360 --> 13:53.160
go to the good places to eat.

13:53.160 --> 13:53.680
So.

13:53.680 --> 13:56.120
But I'm new here, so I can make no promises.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.680
I know, you've tried a few places.

13:58.680 --> 13:59.320
Yeah, a few.

13:59.320 --> 14:02.000
You and I were chatting yesterday, though,

14:02.000 --> 14:04.400
about how things have really changed

14:04.400 --> 14:08.560
in how you troubleshoot and look things up on Linux.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.720
Not to sound old, but when a lot of us started using Linux,

14:11.720 --> 14:13.400
the only way you could look something up

14:13.400 --> 14:15.440
was really the man page.

14:15.440 --> 14:15.920
Right.

14:15.920 --> 14:19.040
And you kind of had on system documentation.

14:19.040 --> 14:23.340
And that was like this resource that was invaluable.

14:23.340 --> 14:27.840
And today, more and more, you see things like flat packs

14:27.840 --> 14:29.800
and snaps and other software projects that just

14:29.800 --> 14:32.480
don't even bother with man pages or update them at all.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.220
And the on system local manual that

14:34.220 --> 14:35.760
doesn't require an internet connection

14:35.760 --> 14:39.160
is starting to slowly become either un-maintained or even

14:39.160 --> 14:40.840
just a thing of the past, depending on how

14:40.840 --> 14:42.600
the software is distributed.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.260
And I'm wondering how that sits with you guys,

14:45.260 --> 14:48.560
because it struck me as maybe we're losing something here.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.960
For me, too, it kind of started with a physical book, right?

14:51.960 --> 14:54.720
Before I knew how to use man pages,

14:54.720 --> 14:56.560
whatever distro that you purchased

14:56.560 --> 14:59.080
came with a manual that you could then

14:59.080 --> 15:02.720
learn how to use man to look up other tools and information

15:02.720 --> 15:05.440
on other tools, but also gave you a little bit of insight,

15:05.440 --> 15:07.980
maybe a little more in-depth information

15:07.980 --> 15:10.400
than just a man page would give you, like man pages.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.480
You're going to say, TAC-T is this vague thing.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.320
And you're like, well, what is that vague thing?

15:16.320 --> 15:19.200
And back in the day when you were looking up man pages

15:19.200 --> 15:21.880
and stuff like that, it was a little bit more difficult

15:21.880 --> 15:27.120
because if you did try to ask that question, like, hey, guys,

15:27.120 --> 15:27.960
what is TAC-T?

15:27.960 --> 15:29.320
Can somebody kind of spell that out?

15:29.320 --> 15:30.800
Can somebody kind of give me a little bit more detail

15:30.800 --> 15:32.400
on what this is?

15:32.400 --> 15:35.000
So the majority of the time, you get RTFM.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.840
And I'm like, I'm literally RTFM-ing.

15:37.840 --> 15:38.600
It's not in there.

15:38.600 --> 15:39.560
It's not in there.

15:39.560 --> 15:42.040
Can you give me a little bit more information?

15:42.040 --> 15:44.320
So then it was very primitive.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.760
You would go try to look at the project maintainer site,

15:46.760 --> 15:48.320
wherever you grab the tarball from,

15:48.320 --> 15:50.720
if it was some application that you would try to dig

15:50.720 --> 15:53.360
through their documentation, hoping that their documentation

15:53.360 --> 15:54.480
was up to date.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.280
But today, it's different, especially

15:56.280 --> 15:58.520
with the container world.

15:58.520 --> 15:59.520
Should they be in there?

15:59.520 --> 16:00.400
I don't know.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.240
A lot of that stuff is obfuscated away from you

16:03.240 --> 16:04.080
anyway.

16:04.080 --> 16:08.440
So it's not like the days of going in and building out

16:08.440 --> 16:11.560
a stack for something or creating this kind of ecosystem

16:11.560 --> 16:12.240
for something.

16:12.240 --> 16:15.000
You don't really necessarily do that anymore.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.440
Here's a package that has all the stuff,

16:17.440 --> 16:21.640
whether that be a container, a snap, a flat pack, any app

16:21.640 --> 16:23.000
image, whatever.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.400
You're generally only going to get what is there.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.760
And so a lot of the stuff that happens behind the scenes

16:28.760 --> 16:30.600
is kind of obfuscated away, which I think

16:30.600 --> 16:32.200
is another question.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.680
How are you going to learn the stuff if you can't

16:34.680 --> 16:37.160
have an opportunity to really look and dive into it?

16:37.160 --> 16:39.360
It kind of makes me think of IRC in the sense

16:39.360 --> 16:43.040
that what's actually happening, the interaction, the core of it

16:43.040 --> 16:43.920
isn't going away.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.600
We still have things like matrix or Slack these days.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.360
But we're switching how it is.

16:48.360 --> 16:52.360
And man pages, they use weird tools to put them together.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.940
You might not understand the structure

16:53.940 --> 16:56.840
of how to actually navigate and what do these numbers mean?

16:56.840 --> 16:57.800
What are the different sections?

16:57.800 --> 16:59.000
How do I get to them?

16:59.000 --> 17:01.120
How do you actually read through compared

17:01.120 --> 17:03.880
to just looking at a Markdown file or some online

17:03.880 --> 17:05.740
documentation that you're linked to?

17:05.740 --> 17:07.240
It's accomplishing the same purpose,

17:07.240 --> 17:08.920
but in very different means.

17:08.920 --> 17:10.640
And then you have wikis, right?

17:10.640 --> 17:14.440
So ArchWiki, generally a great place.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.520
Ubuntu's forums and support, generally

17:16.520 --> 17:17.040
a great place.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.720
Their knowledge base, generally a great place to go.

17:18.720 --> 17:22.280
And I would say probably easier to keep updated than man pages.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.080
I would say so.

17:23.080 --> 17:24.480
And I would say easier to maintain,

17:24.480 --> 17:26.360
because then you don't have to push the man page to a package

17:26.360 --> 17:27.440
and a package update.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.200
Right, the only way you're updating that manage,

17:29.200 --> 17:30.740
or the only way you're updating that man page

17:30.740 --> 17:32.760
is by updating the package, which has to make it

17:32.760 --> 17:34.200
through the distros repo.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.760
And for some distros, that's going to be a long time.

17:36.760 --> 17:37.940
That could be a process.

17:37.940 --> 17:41.320
So it's much easier just to take 40 seconds

17:41.320 --> 17:43.260
and push that update to a wiki.

17:43.260 --> 17:44.680
And it also, I think, also creates

17:44.680 --> 17:46.760
an opportunity for the community to actually get involved

17:46.760 --> 17:48.680
in documentation and help out a lot more.

17:48.680 --> 17:49.480
That's a good point.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.220
Because you don't necessarily have

17:51.220 --> 17:52.760
to be a maintainer of a package or be

17:52.760 --> 17:55.980
involved in the package itself, and you can still

17:55.980 --> 17:57.440
contribute to documentation or things

17:57.440 --> 17:58.440
that you may have learned.

17:58.440 --> 17:58.980
Yeah, really.

17:58.980 --> 18:01.080
And we seem to keep reinventing these things.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.900
I know there's a ton of different projects,

18:02.900 --> 18:06.280
but PyCrash over in our IRC just linked us to TLDR, right?

18:06.280 --> 18:08.680
And here's another tool that you can use as an alternative to man

18:08.680 --> 18:10.680
pages that kind of gets the same thing across.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.000
But this one often has a lot of examples,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.560
which some man pages sorely lack.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.200
That was my favorite thing in a man page.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.640
And when they didn't have the examples,

18:18.640 --> 18:20.080
I was like, well, what good is this?

18:20.080 --> 18:23.080
Yeah, I need my real world use examples, right?

18:23.080 --> 18:25.520
And I mean, that makes all the difference.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.000
I think there's an opportunity, too, for somebody

18:28.000 --> 18:29.840
like a site similar to TLDR or something,

18:29.840 --> 18:31.340
and I haven't looked at it myself,

18:31.340 --> 18:34.520
but to be able to show typical normal commands

18:34.520 --> 18:39.280
and how they can be used and how you can use TAC whatever

18:39.280 --> 18:41.920
to kind of help you navigate that application

18:41.920 --> 18:45.880
or get more out of it and make it clearer for that process

18:45.880 --> 18:48.000
to happen instead of, like I said,

18:48.000 --> 18:49.800
some super vague, like a developer put

18:49.800 --> 18:51.760
in this super vague sentence.

18:51.760 --> 18:52.800
And you're like, what the?

18:52.800 --> 18:53.520
I don't.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.520
OK, it changes the variable.

18:55.520 --> 18:58.680
After we've talked about it, it kind of makes me feel like it's

18:58.680 --> 19:00.940
man pages time, like they're still valuable,

19:00.940 --> 19:03.080
but their time in the sun has sort of passed.

19:03.080 --> 19:06.080
Like we have so many forms of real time communication

19:06.080 --> 19:10.560
from IRC to matrix to Discord to all the things.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.180
And you've got wikis.

19:12.180 --> 19:14.680
It kind of does feel like maybe we've just

19:14.680 --> 19:16.280
sort of outgrown the man page.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.480
Like it's not, like you still, like when you got to get

19:18.480 --> 19:20.120
a box piece of software, you'd love

19:20.120 --> 19:21.780
to still see a manual in there, and from time to time,

19:21.780 --> 19:23.000
it's very useful.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.840
But it's not the difference between getting like Samba up

19:25.840 --> 19:27.040
and running or not anymore.

19:27.040 --> 19:27.360
Right.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.760
No, I mean, it's definitely not.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.680
And for me, back in the day, whenever

19:30.680 --> 19:33.520
I would struggle with man pages and getting told to RTFM

19:33.520 --> 19:39.080
or whatever, I would oftentimes push to like a nutshell book.

19:39.080 --> 19:42.000
So a command line book or, you know.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.120
Yeah, that's really where the books were useful, right?

19:44.120 --> 19:44.360
Absolutely.

19:44.360 --> 19:45.160
With the examples.

19:45.160 --> 19:47.500
Yeah, because that's what gave you that example, right?

19:47.500 --> 19:51.360
So for a lot of us, that was really starting out.

19:51.360 --> 19:55.000
That was kind of our foray into like, well,

19:55.000 --> 19:57.200
if you're interested in SQL, get a book on SQL.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.720
If you're interested in firewalls,

19:59.720 --> 20:02.440
then get a book on IP tables or whatever.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.080
And because firewalls was especially

20:04.080 --> 20:07.000
one of those ones that was just a tricky pain in the ass,

20:07.000 --> 20:07.840
to be quite honest.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.360
Yeah.

20:08.360 --> 20:09.280
It was bad.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.400
And it took just getting the syntax right

20:11.400 --> 20:12.640
and getting everything right.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.960
I still don't know how to configure IP chains.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.160
But it was just such a struggle.

20:18.160 --> 20:21.440
So having that documentation was crucial back then.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.320
And I still have some of those nutshell books

20:23.320 --> 20:25.560
and command books and stuff like that that hang around

20:25.560 --> 20:26.720
that I will forever have.

20:26.720 --> 20:29.880
Because a lot of those, some of those programs don't.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.560
Some of it is still relevant.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.160
LS isn't really going to change.

20:33.160 --> 20:35.080
I mean, yeah, it may be iterated on a lot.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.960
There's also just something, I don't know,

20:36.960 --> 20:38.520
it's a bit of history, too, those books.

20:38.520 --> 20:39.840
They're a little bit of history.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.400
You know, when I was in my very first, well, no,

20:42.400 --> 20:43.480
my second IT job.

20:43.480 --> 20:46.960
My second IT job, the IT crew, I don't know,

20:46.960 --> 20:49.840
once a quarter, maybe a little more frequently than that,

20:49.840 --> 20:52.840
would take, like all of us, would take a long lunch.

20:52.840 --> 20:53.600
And we'd get food.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.600
And then we would go to the bookstore.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.000
And we'd get the books we need for the software

20:58.000 --> 20:59.800
we were working with for that period of time.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.960
And we'd come back with five or six books.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.620
And we had bookshelves in the IT department

21:04.620 --> 21:06.120
with all of the information on it.

21:06.120 --> 21:08.480
And everybody would kind of get a different book.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.280
Because each book had different examples

21:10.280 --> 21:12.320
and different kind of scenarios or whatever, you know?

21:12.320 --> 21:14.040
So like people would kind of intersperse and get

21:14.040 --> 21:16.440
different books so that you could swap books or still

21:16.440 --> 21:17.520
grab that book or get something out of that book.

21:17.520 --> 21:18.560
And you had the nutshell books, which

21:18.560 --> 21:19.560
were known for certain things.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.640
Then you had the books that were known for helping

21:21.640 --> 21:23.080
you cram for a CERT exam.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.560
And it was just very focused on that.

21:24.560 --> 21:27.200
And then you had the really technical books, and then

21:27.200 --> 21:28.400
the more theoretical stuff.

21:28.400 --> 21:31.920
And you just had to know what kind of book guy you were

21:31.920 --> 21:33.360
and get the right one.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.680
And now they're just, well, now it's just, you know.

21:35.680 --> 21:39.160
She's just asking what TAC-T does on Stack Overflow.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.400
And someone answers that.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.240
Yeah, that's it, right?

21:42.240 --> 21:45.840
You know, I've got to admit, like it's been a long time

21:45.840 --> 21:47.600
since I've gotten an RTFM.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.120
It's been a really long time.

21:49.120 --> 21:50.280
It has gotten better.

21:50.280 --> 21:50.800
It has gotten better.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.760
So the community as a whole has gotten better.

21:52.760 --> 21:55.920
I think the documentation is getting better, especially

21:55.920 --> 21:57.720
with the advent of wikis and stuff.

21:57.720 --> 21:59.240
But then, you know, one day if we ever

21:59.240 --> 22:01.400
get thrust in some sort of apocalyptic scenario,

22:01.400 --> 22:03.080
I guess we're all going to be scrambling

22:03.080 --> 22:06.960
for man pages in paperback books or something again.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.280
Well, on that note, Cheesy, what do you say we go scrounge up

22:09.280 --> 22:09.760
some lunch?

22:09.760 --> 22:11.640
Thank you for coming back on the show, sir.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.080
Hey, thank you guys for having me.

22:13.080 --> 22:13.920
It's good to see you.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.200
Good to see you.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.240
Alex, it is so good to see you in person.

22:17.240 --> 22:19.960
My buddy from Self-Hosted is here in Denver with us.

22:19.960 --> 22:20.720
How you doing, man?

22:20.720 --> 22:21.320
Hello.

22:21.320 --> 22:22.440
How was the trip in?

22:22.440 --> 22:25.280
It was smooth, with a sprinkling of bumpy

22:25.280 --> 22:27.040
as we went across the tropical depression.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.680
That's a good way to put it, actually.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.640
Well, we were thinking like there's a million things you

22:30.640 --> 22:31.720
and I could catch up on.

22:31.720 --> 22:32.560
Really?

22:32.560 --> 22:34.760
But one of our favorite topics that we

22:34.760 --> 22:37.260
talk a lot about on Self-Hosted but don't talk about very much

22:37.260 --> 22:39.720
on this show is one of my favorite free software

22:39.720 --> 22:42.360
projects of all time, and that's Home Assistant.

22:42.360 --> 22:42.880
Yeah, yeah.

22:42.880 --> 22:43.880
Who would have guessed?

22:43.880 --> 22:44.440
I know.

22:44.440 --> 22:47.320
And they recently had an update that

22:47.320 --> 22:52.440
adds a feature that both you and I are extremely excited about.

22:52.440 --> 22:54.040
I can't even imagine the possibilities.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.680
Once I start pulling in energy information

22:55.680 --> 22:57.080
in Home Assistant, the kind of automations

22:57.080 --> 22:58.420
I can build around that are going

22:58.420 --> 23:01.560
to change my life because I'm running off solar in that RV.

23:01.560 --> 23:02.840
So it's energy monitoring.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.440
It's here, it's real, and it's built

23:04.440 --> 23:05.720
into Home Assistant with a new release.

23:05.720 --> 23:07.280
And you've had a chance to look at it.

23:07.280 --> 23:10.840
Yeah, with the August update, so 2021.08,

23:10.840 --> 23:14.240
Home Assistant have added energy monitoring, as we just said.

23:14.240 --> 23:17.640
And out of the box, there are several integrations

23:17.640 --> 23:19.480
that will just work.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.640
And luckily for me, Frank, who is

23:21.640 --> 23:24.720
one of the main Home Assistant developers,

23:24.720 --> 23:29.160
has a solar system with exactly the same integration as I use,

23:29.160 --> 23:30.360
which is the solar edge one.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.200
So for me, it just works.

23:32.200 --> 23:32.960
That's so great.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.720
Yeah, so after the update, I thought

23:34.720 --> 23:36.960
that's the Home Assistant lottery right there.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.560
You know how to pick a project.

23:38.560 --> 23:39.800
Yeah.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.040
So after the update, I ran through a little wizard,

23:42.040 --> 23:44.280
which said pick a bunch of sensors.

23:44.280 --> 23:47.400
For me, it was just a couple of solar edge sensors.

23:47.400 --> 23:50.280
It then does a bunch of smarts on its back end

23:50.280 --> 23:54.920
and integrates with the solar forecast.io plugin

23:54.920 --> 23:56.880
to generate a little graph of what it thinks

23:56.880 --> 23:58.800
the UV power is going to be or whatever.

23:58.800 --> 23:59.480
Oh, that's great.

23:59.480 --> 24:02.640
With my azimuth, with my dangle of my panels

24:02.640 --> 24:04.240
and all that kind of stuff.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.120
So what that would mean for me is

24:06.120 --> 24:07.680
I could kind of plan how we're going to energy

24:07.680 --> 24:08.520
manage for that day.

24:08.520 --> 24:09.800
Because right now, I'm kind of like,

24:09.800 --> 24:11.080
I wait for the sun to come up.

24:11.080 --> 24:11.920
How cloudy is it?

24:11.920 --> 24:15.400
And I just kind of guess as the day goes on.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.960
You're doing it yourself with whatever basic heuristics

24:17.960 --> 24:19.840
you've learned, but you don't have the data.

24:19.840 --> 24:22.640
And now, so yesterday, Lady Joop's got up

24:22.640 --> 24:23.840
to 107 degrees inside.

24:23.840 --> 24:24.640
Yeah, that's hot.

24:24.640 --> 24:25.960
And it was just unbearable.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.720
And I didn't want to run the generator here

24:27.720 --> 24:30.120
in the system 76 parking lot to run the AC.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.400
Because when you run both ACs, you're

24:32.400 --> 24:35.120
looking at almost a 3,000 watt when you also

24:35.120 --> 24:37.720
add in battery charging, a 3,000 watt draw consistently.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.240
And that generates heat.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.120
And when you are already 107 degrees,

24:41.120 --> 24:42.600
you don't want to generate much heat.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.400
You're going to start killing your equipment.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.240
And so we moved in the middle of the morning,

24:47.240 --> 24:49.400
I guess is the way to put it, very early in the morning,

24:49.400 --> 24:51.200
we moved to a spot with shade.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.780
But now, I'm dealing with the fact

24:52.780 --> 24:56.040
that I am sitting around 60% charge.

24:56.040 --> 24:58.440
And I really don't know how long I can stretch that out.

24:58.440 --> 25:00.520
And so something that would give me the ability

25:00.520 --> 25:02.480
to even just forecast like that.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.080
But to take it to the next step, Alex,

25:04.080 --> 25:07.680
I could actually monitor the actual power generation

25:07.680 --> 25:08.760
of the solar system, right?

25:08.760 --> 25:10.360
So not only would I have the forecast,

25:10.360 --> 25:11.140
but I could see what I'm actually

25:11.140 --> 25:12.280
making in Home Assistant.

25:12.280 --> 25:15.200
And that becomes like a source of sensor information

25:15.200 --> 25:17.000
that the system can build automations around.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.560
Have you experimented with that at all?

25:18.560 --> 25:20.680
There's a bunch of stuff, actually, that you can do.

25:20.680 --> 25:22.280
And I'm going to show you in person.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.860
If you want to know what we're talking about,

25:23.860 --> 25:24.840
have a look at the release.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.680
We'll put in the show notes for this.

25:26.680 --> 25:29.800
And the solar generation, you can see there

25:29.800 --> 25:31.640
what the weather forecast has predicted

25:31.640 --> 25:32.720
I'm going to get at my location.

25:32.720 --> 25:33.840
And then what you actually got, right?

25:33.840 --> 25:36.280
Yeah, so you can see the orange underneath, the dotted line.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.920
There's a bit of a delta there.

25:37.920 --> 25:41.500
So at the top, there's like a energy usage panel.

25:41.500 --> 25:44.320
And there's a few bars that say how much you've actually

25:44.320 --> 25:47.080
used versus how much you're returning to the grid.

25:47.080 --> 25:50.160
And then when you are returning to the grid,

25:50.160 --> 25:54.240
you could do some smarts to say, only run my AC unit

25:54.240 --> 25:57.480
when I've got spare capacity over a kill or whatever.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.480
That is brilliant.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.920
OK, so how much of this stuff with this update,

26:01.920 --> 26:04.120
is it just the connection to existing tooling?

26:04.120 --> 26:05.560
Or is it also some of that support

26:05.560 --> 26:08.340
at the dashboarding and the actual software level too?

26:08.340 --> 26:09.800
I was pleasantly surprised.

26:09.800 --> 26:13.320
I opened the GitHub issue on the Solar Edge integration.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.520
And Frank came in and changed a couple lines of code

26:15.520 --> 26:17.200
because some of the templating of the sensors

26:17.200 --> 26:19.120
of that particular integration were a little bit

26:19.120 --> 26:20.640
wonky on release day.

26:20.640 --> 26:23.280
But now, as you can see, it just works just fine.

26:23.280 --> 26:26.240
And the wizard that they walk you through,

26:26.240 --> 26:28.520
when you first do this 08 update,

26:28.520 --> 26:31.800
that wizard says which sensor is the input, which

26:31.800 --> 26:34.200
sensor is the output, all that kind of stuff.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.240
And it takes a minute or two.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.480
And then it adds a new tab on the left-hand side.

26:38.480 --> 26:40.060
Or you've got overview, map, whatever.

26:40.060 --> 26:42.360
There's now an energy tab on the left.

26:42.360 --> 26:43.840
And it just works, yeah.

26:43.840 --> 26:46.920
Jeez, I'm going to have to try that soon.

26:46.920 --> 26:47.840
That's great.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.040
I'm really kind of impressed with the direction

26:50.040 --> 26:52.400
they're taking that stuff because they consistently

26:52.400 --> 26:55.120
come up with new ways of building automations off

26:55.120 --> 26:57.520
of information that I'd never even thought of before.

26:57.520 --> 27:00.720
And if I could just impart one bit of advice

27:00.720 --> 27:03.040
from this episode is if you haven't tried out Home Assistant

27:03.040 --> 27:05.800
yet, throw it in a VM and let it look at your network

27:05.800 --> 27:07.000
and just see what it finds.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.480
And maybe just start playing with that

27:08.480 --> 27:10.560
because you'll be surprised at how many things it

27:10.560 --> 27:11.040
might detect.

27:11.040 --> 27:14.320
If you've got a Chromecast or an Apple TV on your network

27:14.320 --> 27:17.800
or a Plex client and server, it will automatically

27:17.800 --> 27:20.100
figure that out and say, hey, I could integrate automations

27:20.100 --> 27:20.880
around that.

27:20.880 --> 27:23.880
For some reason, let's say you had a multicolored light bulb

27:23.880 --> 27:26.420
in your lounge and you wanted it to turn red every time that

27:26.420 --> 27:28.840
someone was streaming something from your Plex server.

27:28.840 --> 27:29.600
You could do that.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.160
And these are devices that are in totally different

27:32.160 --> 27:32.960
ecosystems.

27:32.960 --> 27:35.960
A Hue bulb talking to a Plex server

27:35.960 --> 27:39.340
doesn't really compute in normal people land.

27:39.340 --> 27:41.920
But in Home Assistant land, you can do it because it

27:41.920 --> 27:43.120
has tendrils.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.960
It has fingers in every single pie of what's

27:44.960 --> 27:46.280
going on on your network.

27:46.280 --> 27:49.400
And it can figure out, oh, this sensor just changed state

27:49.400 --> 27:50.640
from this to that.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.100
And then you write an automation that

27:52.100 --> 27:53.760
says, if this threshold's been exceeded

27:53.760 --> 27:56.240
for x number of minutes, then do this.

27:56.240 --> 27:59.480
So it's essentially it's if this, then that on your LAN

27:59.480 --> 28:01.360
on total and utter steroids.

28:01.360 --> 28:02.160
Right.

28:02.160 --> 28:05.120
And under your complete control and all that information

28:05.120 --> 28:07.460
about when you're doing stuff and when you came and left

28:07.460 --> 28:09.220
and when you turn stuff on, it's not

28:09.220 --> 28:10.440
going out to some cloud provider who's

28:10.440 --> 28:11.640
building a profile about you.

28:11.640 --> 28:14.140
It's staying on your LAN, on your box.

28:14.140 --> 28:16.660
And that, to me, is the ultimate win.

28:16.660 --> 28:18.080
It's amazing how far this has come

28:18.080 --> 28:20.680
and it's kind of lifted the level that you can do.

28:20.680 --> 28:24.080
You can write an easy automation that maybe three years ago,

28:24.080 --> 28:25.960
I'd be rigging something up on a Raspberry Pi

28:25.960 --> 28:27.640
by hand with a custom Python script.

28:27.640 --> 28:28.660
Totally.

28:28.660 --> 28:30.160
Well, Alex, I'm looking forward to going

28:30.160 --> 28:31.440
and doing a little cookout soon.

28:31.440 --> 28:32.360
Yes, me too.

28:32.360 --> 28:33.640
Got any ideas of what we should cook?

28:33.640 --> 28:34.440
Well, we can cook in here.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.400
This room is hot as anything, isn't it?

28:36.400 --> 28:38.880
I'm very grateful they have a sound booth in their factory,

28:38.880 --> 28:40.680
obviously, because it makes this possible.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.680
But there's no ventilation because it's a sound booth.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.100
Have you seen the eye in your thighs?

28:45.100 --> 28:46.440
Now you know why.

28:46.440 --> 28:49.360
Oh, wow.

28:49.360 --> 28:52.080
Aaron Honeycutt from System76 joins us.

28:52.080 --> 28:55.280
Aaron, I think you were on the show like 100 years ago.

28:55.280 --> 28:56.320
I think it's been a while.

28:56.320 --> 28:57.620
I think we have chatted before.

28:57.620 --> 28:59.920
I think I took over a podcast for somebody

28:59.920 --> 29:02.640
at Self in the before times.

29:02.640 --> 29:03.760
OK, OK, all right.

29:03.760 --> 29:06.200
Yeah, in the before times, exactly.

29:06.200 --> 29:10.940
Well, just like a quick recap, what does Aaron do at System76?

29:10.940 --> 29:13.520
I'm a happiness engineer on the support team.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.840
So to anyone who's outside, it's technical support, basically.

29:16.840 --> 29:18.080
Right, OK.

29:18.080 --> 29:21.200
Well, I noticed you have a PineTime on your wrist.

29:21.200 --> 29:21.720
I do.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.040
And I haven't talked to anybody who's actually

29:24.040 --> 29:25.200
using one on the daily.

29:25.200 --> 29:29.040
So I'm curious to get your thoughts on the PineTime.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.120
And how much was it for that watch, too?

29:31.120 --> 29:36.320
It was around $40-ish USD with shipping and everything.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.320
Wow.

29:37.320 --> 29:39.320
I don't even understand how it can be that cheap.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.780
I mean, that's Raspberry Pi money.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.280
Is it worth $40?

29:42.280 --> 29:43.760
So far, I just got it yesterday.

29:43.760 --> 29:45.360
So I can't make solid conclusions.

29:45.360 --> 29:47.160
But I think it's very much worth it,

29:47.160 --> 29:52.680
because I wanted a spiritual successor to Pebble.

29:52.680 --> 29:53.920
I've had Samsung watches.

29:53.920 --> 29:57.440
And I hate having to have all of this Samsung crap on my phone

29:57.440 --> 29:58.760
since I have a Pixel.

29:58.760 --> 30:00.340
I don't have a Samsung phone anymore.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.600
I'm like, I don't want all this crap on my phone, just

30:02.600 --> 30:03.400
notifications.

30:03.400 --> 30:04.120
Yeah.

30:04.120 --> 30:06.800
And has it done the job of replacing

30:06.800 --> 30:07.840
what the Pebble gave you?

30:07.840 --> 30:11.760
So far, I think it's pretty good replacement for it.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.200
I don't know whether I would have.

30:14.200 --> 30:17.440
I had both the e-ink non-color and color Pebble.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.920
So I can't say whether I would prefer one or the other.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.640
But I think it's been a good replacement.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.960
And $40, too, it's worth experimenting with, right?

30:23.960 --> 30:24.460
It's like.

30:24.460 --> 30:25.320
Yeah.

30:25.320 --> 30:28.520
Whether it's going to be good or not is kind of two lunches

30:28.520 --> 30:29.320
right there.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.520
I always wonder with Pine, though,

30:30.520 --> 30:32.720
is the plan to just really put the prices low

30:32.720 --> 30:35.480
and just keep expectations low and keep it that way forever?

30:35.480 --> 30:38.120
Or are they going to eventually start creeping the price up?

30:38.120 --> 30:39.160
Yeah.

30:39.160 --> 30:39.840
I don't know.

30:39.840 --> 30:42.240
It was, it seems like it was in the same price point

30:42.240 --> 30:45.680
when it was non-sealed and dev kit

30:45.680 --> 30:48.720
potential versus the sealed one, which this is the sealed one.

30:48.720 --> 30:51.400
So I don't have access to any programming interfaces

30:51.400 --> 30:53.120
or GOPI pins.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.240
So more consumer version.

30:54.240 --> 30:56.320
Consumer focused version, I feel like.

30:56.320 --> 30:57.800
Which is where they're going to have to take it, right?

30:57.800 --> 30:58.280
Eventually.

30:58.280 --> 30:58.560
So.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.240
Yeah.

30:59.240 --> 31:01.440
I just actually did a firmware update for the first time

31:01.440 --> 31:03.720
earlier because it shipped with 1.2.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.920
So is there like an app on your phone that does that?

31:05.920 --> 31:07.120
I have GadgetBridge.

31:07.120 --> 31:11.160
And then you download the.zip file from GitHub

31:11.160 --> 31:13.080
and then click it to open it on Android.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.200
And then you can choose to open with GadgetBridge.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.080
And then it does the firmware update for you.

31:17.080 --> 31:19.440
And that's progress bar on the app and on the watch.

31:19.440 --> 31:20.120
Nice.

31:20.120 --> 31:20.600
Yeah.

31:20.600 --> 31:21.440
That's not too bad.

31:21.440 --> 31:22.160
That's nice.

31:22.160 --> 31:23.880
I mean, as long as you're comfortable doing those things.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.200
But anybody buying a PineTime?

31:25.200 --> 31:25.440
Probably.

31:25.440 --> 31:26.520
I mean, you wouldn't buy one of those.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.200
But you're also just used to, some people

31:28.200 --> 31:30.200
just download APK files and just install them.

31:30.200 --> 31:30.760
So.

31:30.760 --> 31:31.800
That's true.

31:31.800 --> 31:33.920
So the other thing, you get labeled as a gamer

31:33.920 --> 31:34.920
when I come in here.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.080
Like, oh, yeah, you want to talk about gaming.

31:36.080 --> 31:37.120
I want to talk to Aaron.

31:37.120 --> 31:37.800
Are you a big gamer?

31:37.800 --> 31:38.320
Is that true?

31:38.320 --> 31:39.320
Yeah.

31:39.320 --> 31:42.640
I have a guest stop at home just for work, pleasure,

31:42.640 --> 31:44.000
and gaming.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.440
Multi-purpose, I'll have that.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.800
How have you done in this part shortage drought?

31:47.800 --> 31:51.000
I had everything set up before the drought.

31:51.000 --> 31:51.920
Oh, lucky you.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.440
I have an RX 580.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.760
So I had everything set up with the 8 gig model.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.560
So I was already set up for.

31:57.560 --> 31:58.080
Nice.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.120
You lucky devil.

31:59.120 --> 32:03.240
See, the reason why I ask is people suggested,

32:03.240 --> 32:06.060
people said that we should talk about the Steam Deck

32:06.060 --> 32:09.120
and Wes and I have got a million thoughts on the Steam Deck.

32:09.120 --> 32:10.840
But I'm curious what your first impressions are,

32:10.840 --> 32:14.800
both from a gamer's perspective, but also your personal opinion

32:14.800 --> 32:17.960
as a System76 employee who watches a company produce

32:17.960 --> 32:19.400
hardware on the regular.

32:19.400 --> 32:21.680
You must have some thoughts in both regards.

32:21.680 --> 32:24.840
I love it as the idea.

32:24.840 --> 32:26.640
The first thing that kind of threw me off

32:26.640 --> 32:30.640
was if you look at the HTC Vive, the Vive Index,

32:30.640 --> 32:34.320
on their page, it has its own separate page on steam.com

32:34.320 --> 32:35.560
or steam.com.

32:35.560 --> 32:38.800
This is a whole other website, which is a little bit weird.

32:38.800 --> 32:41.440
What do you take from that?

32:41.440 --> 32:43.480
Like it's outside the ecosystem almost?

32:43.480 --> 32:44.320
It's hard to tell.

32:44.320 --> 32:45.980
I think they're kind of just figuring out

32:45.980 --> 32:48.040
whether they want this as a main thing.

32:48.040 --> 32:50.600
Right, is that a lingering hedge from getting

32:50.600 --> 32:52.480
burned by steam machines, perhaps?

32:52.480 --> 32:53.760
I see, yeah.

32:53.760 --> 32:56.040
And what do you think of it from a hardware standpoint?

32:56.040 --> 32:58.320
I, particularly the hardware, looks really good.

32:58.320 --> 33:01.000
I mean, a lot of gamers, and myself included, my rig

33:01.000 --> 33:01.920
is all AMD.

33:01.920 --> 33:04.560
So I'm like, I'm all in on just AMD hardware

33:04.560 --> 33:05.560
from the get-go.

33:05.560 --> 33:08.060
Yeah, I mean, as a Linux user, it makes things a lot easier.

33:08.060 --> 33:10.840
Yeah, because I don't deal with the pro driver from AMD.

33:10.840 --> 33:13.400
The one from the kernel works perfectly fine for everything.

33:13.400 --> 33:16.600
I've been playing, oh god, playing everything

33:16.600 --> 33:18.040
that I don't need to deal with.

33:18.040 --> 33:20.440
Yeah, I've never needed to reload the pro driver.

33:20.440 --> 33:22.360
People say you've got to have the pro driver.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.760
It doesn't even load on, last I checked,

33:24.760 --> 33:26.360
current Ubuntu anyway, because they're

33:26.360 --> 33:28.280
trying to hit older kernels, and Ubuntu

33:28.280 --> 33:29.560
is too new of a kernel for it.

33:29.560 --> 33:33.000
And they don't want to deal with it for something.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.520
Yeah, I think it also, I honestly

33:34.520 --> 33:37.760
think it has potential as a little portable workstation

33:37.760 --> 33:38.320
for me.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.800
I could see using it to do work.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.680
A coworker brought up that the Nintendo Switch does

33:43.680 --> 33:46.400
720p while mobile, because the screen's on.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.120
A docks turns off the built-in display

33:48.120 --> 33:50.640
to get the 1080 performance difference.

33:50.640 --> 33:53.520
All the videos show that the screen's fully on.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.480
So I'm just wondering how very powered

33:55.480 --> 33:58.520
it's going to be, if you use a desktop placement.

33:58.520 --> 34:00.600
Do you think it's going to be doing double duty,

34:00.600 --> 34:02.640
run the internal screen and an external monitor?

34:02.640 --> 34:03.880
Would it be pushing it too hard?

34:03.880 --> 34:06.320
I'm wondering if they're going to change that later on

34:06.320 --> 34:08.040
and just make it powered off.

34:08.040 --> 34:11.160
It'd just kind of be weird looking at it from just screen

34:11.160 --> 34:13.080
off, though, and it's just docked.

34:13.080 --> 34:15.280
The Nintendo at least covers the front screen up

34:15.280 --> 34:17.320
when they do that, so you don't really notice it.

34:17.320 --> 34:18.880
Yeah, that is a clever way.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.440
I never thought that's why they do that with the dock,

34:20.440 --> 34:23.880
but that's totally wise, so you don't expect that screen there.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.920
Yeah, Valve seems to be really embracing this.

34:25.920 --> 34:28.720
It's a PC, so if a PC can do it, the deck's going to do it.

34:28.720 --> 34:31.240
And that's part of that philosophy, I think.

34:31.240 --> 34:32.680
I kind of want a hybrid model here,

34:32.680 --> 34:34.840
like a game where I can SSH into my servers,

34:34.840 --> 34:36.560
but then I'm actually shooting zombies

34:36.560 --> 34:37.960
that are rogue processes.

34:37.960 --> 34:38.800
That might be a thing.

34:38.800 --> 34:39.840
We should look into that.

34:39.840 --> 34:42.960
That'd actually be pretty great.

34:42.960 --> 34:43.400
I'd like that.

34:43.400 --> 34:44.640
Now I'm just thinking of use cases

34:44.640 --> 34:45.720
if they leave the screen on.

34:45.720 --> 34:47.640
Yeah, I mean, for Steam chat, for one thing, it would be nice.

34:47.640 --> 34:49.920
Or just watching the CPU resources and whatnot

34:49.920 --> 34:50.520
could be handy.

34:50.520 --> 34:52.440
What if you stream from it on Twitch

34:52.440 --> 34:53.760
and then you just watch chat on it?

34:53.760 --> 34:54.240
Yeah.

34:54.240 --> 34:56.760
The ways you can abuse this thing, it's going to be great.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.280
It kind of makes you kind of think

34:58.280 --> 35:00.360
of the ways that you abuse some of the laptops that

35:00.360 --> 35:04.280
have a little split screen above the keyboard.

35:04.280 --> 35:05.280
How do you use that?

35:05.280 --> 35:06.440
I don't know.

35:06.440 --> 35:08.520
Yeah, I'm always looking for more screens.

35:08.520 --> 35:10.320
So if there's a way, I'll go for it.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.280
And the only problem for me for total portability

35:12.280 --> 35:14.520
is, of course, I'd have to have a dock, an external monitor,

35:14.520 --> 35:14.920
and all that.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.480
And so then a laptop just becomes more pragmatic.

35:16.480 --> 35:18.120
But I could see it around the house.

35:18.120 --> 35:20.280
It's kind of interesting on those portable displays

35:20.280 --> 35:22.720
and weather, because Nintendo just limits the spec,

35:22.720 --> 35:25.280
and their dock does the rest with type C.

35:25.280 --> 35:27.320
But if they're following the spec correctly,

35:27.320 --> 35:28.480
you won't really need a dock.

35:28.480 --> 35:31.200
You just get a cable and lay it flat on the desk,

35:31.200 --> 35:32.760
and a portable monitor would work.

35:32.760 --> 35:33.800
Yeah, that's true.

35:33.800 --> 35:34.320
That's true.

35:34.320 --> 35:35.320
Yeah, I could see it.

35:35.320 --> 35:37.880
I also could see it as a decent kids' workstation as well.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.280
Give my kids a deck, and then they plug it

35:39.280 --> 35:41.040
into the dock at home, and they have a full desktop.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.520
And they still have that gaming rig

35:42.520 --> 35:44.960
they've been begging you for.

35:44.960 --> 35:47.120
Well, Aaron, thanks for coming in and chatting with us.

35:47.120 --> 35:48.160
It was good to chat with you.

35:48.160 --> 35:50.280
Yeah, thanks.

35:50.280 --> 35:51.920
Ian, welcome back to the show.

35:51.920 --> 35:53.760
And it's great to actually do this in person.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.120
I know.

35:55.120 --> 35:55.880
It's been a while.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.080
It has.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.520
It's been a long time, I think, since you've been on, too.

35:59.520 --> 36:03.200
And there's been a lot of things happening in desktop land

36:03.200 --> 36:04.920
for System76 since we've chatted.

36:04.920 --> 36:06.560
So I'm really excited to talk about that.

36:06.560 --> 36:09.120
And I got to start with a thing that's on my mind.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.960
And when I asked other people, I said, hey, what should I ask Ian?

36:11.960 --> 36:13.720
This is the question they suggested.

36:13.720 --> 36:18.760
Everyone's curious about Pop OS's transition to GTK4

36:18.760 --> 36:21.240
and what that looks like and how it's going.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.160
Because I imagine there's a lot of work that

36:23.160 --> 36:24.760
has to be done to get things, especially

36:24.760 --> 36:28.000
with the theme and whatnot, to get things working with GTK4.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.400
That's most of what I'm doing with it right now,

36:30.400 --> 36:34.920
is just working on doing the GTK4 port of the theme

36:34.920 --> 36:36.880
to make sure the style sheet is working

36:36.880 --> 36:39.440
and stuff's not falling back on Oddwaiter or anything

36:39.440 --> 36:41.680
like that, because it looks a little strange if you're

36:41.680 --> 36:43.440
expecting your system to look one way.

36:43.440 --> 36:46.040
And all of a sudden, you boot it up,

36:46.040 --> 36:49.000
and one application looks off.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.720
It can be a little jarring if that's.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.400
But it does fall back, though.

36:52.400 --> 36:53.680
That's kind of interesting.

36:53.680 --> 36:55.480
Oh, yeah, no, it's kind of like Flatpak.

36:55.480 --> 36:58.280
If you don't have a Flatpak theme for your current theme

36:58.280 --> 37:02.240
installed, it will fall back on whatever is available.

37:02.240 --> 37:04.000
And it'll always fall back to something.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.600
You won't ever end up with an unthemed, clear, transparent

37:07.600 --> 37:08.360
thing.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.200
I mean, that's reasonable, I suppose.

37:10.200 --> 37:10.960
Good defaults.

37:10.960 --> 37:11.840
Yeah.

37:11.840 --> 37:13.360
Now that I think about it.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.160
It's better to fall back on something that

37:15.160 --> 37:18.320
doesn't match than to fall back on something that doesn't exist.

37:18.320 --> 37:18.920
No kidding.

37:18.920 --> 37:20.560
It's just impossible to see.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.360
I'll take an ugly UI over a broken one.

37:22.360 --> 37:23.960
Yeah, at least one you can use, right?

37:23.960 --> 37:25.640
Well, and Adwaita isn't even ugly.

37:25.640 --> 37:30.280
I mean, it used to be a little, it needed some help

37:30.280 --> 37:31.760
at one point, but they've brought

37:31.760 --> 37:34.500
in some really good designers, and now it looks really good.

37:34.500 --> 37:38.120
So I mean, the pop theme now is actually basically just Adwaita

37:38.120 --> 37:40.480
with some colors changed around and stuff like that.

37:40.480 --> 37:43.280
It's very close, and that helps maintain the compatibility

37:43.280 --> 37:44.360
and stuff as well.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.400
Right, I would imagine the closer you can keep it

37:46.400 --> 37:49.440
upstream, the, well, I guess one way to put it,

37:49.440 --> 37:50.720
is easier your job is.

37:50.720 --> 37:52.320
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

37:52.320 --> 37:54.360
And that's another nice thing about it,

37:54.360 --> 37:58.500
is it makes doing the GTK4 port very easy,

37:58.500 --> 38:01.280
because I can just take the upstream Adwaita theme

38:01.280 --> 38:04.040
and apply our modifications onto it,

38:04.040 --> 38:09.680
and hopefully that translates over pretty nicely and stuff.

38:09.680 --> 38:10.720
How's that going so far?

38:10.720 --> 38:11.760
Pretty good.

38:11.760 --> 38:13.720
So I've been working on it now for a couple days,

38:13.720 --> 38:17.080
and there's pretty good progress.

38:17.080 --> 38:20.800
I'd say it's currently in a this is a usable pop theme right

38:20.800 --> 38:21.300
now.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.920
It looks more or less correct.

38:22.920 --> 38:25.600
There's some weird visual glitches

38:25.600 --> 38:29.680
working on check buttons right now, check boxes and stuff.

38:29.680 --> 38:31.120
I'm so glad someone is.

38:31.120 --> 38:32.080
Yeah, right?

38:32.080 --> 38:33.440
Somebody's got to do that.

38:33.440 --> 38:37.120
I imagine, too, that the transition to GNOME,

38:37.120 --> 38:39.280
or sorry, GNOME 40, must be on the back of your mind

38:39.280 --> 38:40.160
as well with this.

38:40.160 --> 38:42.280
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

38:42.280 --> 38:45.200
They don't necessarily go hand in hand.

38:45.200 --> 38:48.320
More of the GTK4 stuff is more just

38:48.320 --> 38:50.680
to make sure that it's available for applications that

38:50.680 --> 38:52.840
use GTK4 as it stands.

38:52.840 --> 38:56.560
If you install a GTK4 application on pop today,

38:56.560 --> 38:58.680
you'll get an auto waita theme, and that's not

38:58.680 --> 39:01.440
the best situation from our perspective.

39:01.440 --> 39:02.940
Yeah, from a consistency standpoint.

39:02.940 --> 39:03.440
Right.

39:03.440 --> 39:06.320
So we're trying to make sure that for impish, that's

39:06.320 --> 39:08.880
not going to be a huge problem.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.560
And then with GNOME 40, people are probably

39:12.560 --> 39:15.360
aware that with 21.04, like Ubuntu,

39:15.360 --> 39:18.360
we sat out on the initial GNOME 40 release

39:18.360 --> 39:21.200
just to help make sure that everything got stabilized there.

39:21.200 --> 39:25.080
We've got our UX designer here works with the GNOME design

39:25.080 --> 39:28.680
team and stuff like that to help make sure everything's good.

39:28.680 --> 39:31.880
And she was basically just working

39:31.880 --> 39:35.220
with us as a liaison between us and the design team there.

39:35.220 --> 39:41.340
But we wanted to gain some feedback about GNOME 40

39:41.340 --> 39:43.640
and all that kind of stuff.

39:43.640 --> 39:49.080
So we held off on 338 for largely similar reasons

39:49.080 --> 39:49.880
that Ubuntu did.

39:49.880 --> 39:55.700
And as Ubuntu plans to move forward with,

39:55.700 --> 40:00.080
I think it's going to end up being 41 or 42, not GNOME 40

40:00.080 --> 40:01.520
because then they'd be behind.

40:01.520 --> 40:04.480
But we're working on moving that forward as well.

40:04.480 --> 40:06.920
And we have quite a bit of stuff that we

40:06.920 --> 40:08.440
have to work through on that.

40:08.440 --> 40:12.640
Obviously, we have Cosmic, which is our desktop shell extension

40:12.640 --> 40:17.120
stuff that does some relatively large scale

40:17.120 --> 40:19.120
tweaks to GNOME that are tailored more

40:19.120 --> 40:23.600
towards our specific user base, like different target markets,

40:23.600 --> 40:25.680
different products, that kind of thing.

40:25.680 --> 40:28.600
And we're working full steam ahead.

40:28.600 --> 40:32.120
I know that Ian Scott, one of our other developers,

40:32.120 --> 40:38.000
is doing a lot with porting Cosmic to GNOME 40.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.680
Jeremy's doing a lot of that kind of stuff.

40:40.680 --> 40:43.000
So we want to make sure that everything is set up

40:43.000 --> 40:46.920
and ready to go once we're ready to make the switch over

40:46.920 --> 40:48.200
and all that kind of stuff.

40:48.200 --> 40:50.240
So you're saying it's going to be a while until I

40:50.240 --> 40:53.160
have a pop OS based on Plasma.

40:53.160 --> 40:54.880
Yeah.

40:54.880 --> 40:57.720
It's just a dream of mine.

40:57.720 --> 40:58.760
Let's do it.

40:58.760 --> 41:00.600
Let's go.

41:00.600 --> 41:01.800
Easy for us to say, right?

41:01.800 --> 41:04.480
Yeah, very easy for you guys to say.

41:04.480 --> 41:06.400
The entire infrastructure is built on GNOME.

41:06.400 --> 41:10.160
I mean, Cosmic is a GNOME shell extension.

41:10.160 --> 41:13.600
So it seems like this is kind of a test of that model, right?

41:13.600 --> 41:15.440
Of you kind of doing the dance of, well,

41:15.440 --> 41:17.400
how much can we just lay on top in an easy way?

41:17.400 --> 41:19.400
And how much do we really have to keep up with the changes?

41:19.400 --> 41:20.360
Is this hard?

41:20.360 --> 41:21.040
Right, right.

41:21.040 --> 41:24.520
And luckily, with the extension model, it's not too bad.

41:24.520 --> 41:26.800
Most of it translates over pretty easily.

41:26.800 --> 41:29.680
And if there are problems, it doesn't cause the entire shell

41:29.680 --> 41:33.120
to just bug out and crash, especially going

41:33.120 --> 41:35.200
with the GNOME 40 stuff right now.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.080
Cosmic's in kind of a weird state,

41:37.080 --> 41:39.080
and stuff doesn't work right.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.240
But that's the nice thing about doing it that way,

41:42.240 --> 41:47.160
is the base OS is still usable, because it's just an extension.

41:47.160 --> 41:49.960
You just unload the extension, and it works fine.

41:49.960 --> 41:51.680
And then once you get the extension working,

41:51.680 --> 41:55.840
you can load up nicely, and everything works well there too.

41:55.840 --> 41:57.680
And nicely, if you don't like Cosmic,

41:57.680 --> 41:59.440
you can just disable the extensions,

41:59.440 --> 42:03.040
and you get a plain stock GNOME desktop.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.520
Can we talk a little bit about Cosmic?

42:04.520 --> 42:05.360
Absolutely.

42:05.360 --> 42:07.520
Why don't we just start with why Cosmic?

42:07.520 --> 42:12.200
So people might be aware that we, a couple releases ago now,

42:12.200 --> 42:14.800
we introduced PopShell, which was a tiling window manager

42:14.800 --> 42:16.160
extension.

42:16.160 --> 42:19.520
Basically, we wanted to kind of elaborate on that,

42:19.520 --> 42:22.000
and what we would kind of be going

42:22.000 --> 42:26.440
for if we were doing our own desktop shell from scratch.

42:26.440 --> 42:28.760
The extension framework in GNOME Shell

42:28.760 --> 42:30.840
allows us to experiment with that in a way

42:30.840 --> 42:34.320
that it saves development effort on our end,

42:34.320 --> 42:36.880
because we don't have an enormous team.

42:36.880 --> 42:39.280
We're adequately spread.

42:39.280 --> 42:42.240
We know what we can take on, and where we should probably

42:42.240 --> 42:43.720
try to, you know,

42:43.720 --> 42:44.760
Utilize upstream.

42:44.760 --> 42:45.560
Exactly, right.

42:45.560 --> 42:47.560
Don't reinvent the wheel when you don't have to.

42:47.560 --> 42:48.040
Right.

42:48.040 --> 42:50.040
Utilize existing stuff when you can.

42:50.040 --> 42:52.160
And if there's something new that you

42:52.160 --> 42:54.600
want to do on top of that, build on top of it.

42:54.600 --> 42:58.480
Collaborative development is a, that's open source.

42:58.480 --> 42:59.760
That's the whole point.

42:59.760 --> 43:03.800
And so when looking at our customer base,

43:03.800 --> 43:06.840
and our pop OS user base, we wanted

43:06.840 --> 43:09.280
to make something that was tailored specifically

43:09.280 --> 43:13.640
for the kind of person that uses pop OS by default.

43:13.640 --> 43:16.880
And so we would look at, well, what's the kind of changes

43:16.880 --> 43:18.520
that people that run pop OS make?

43:18.520 --> 43:20.200
You know, what kind of things can we

43:20.200 --> 43:23.960
do from a UX perspective to help that type of user?

43:23.960 --> 43:26.560
And we found a couple of things that

43:26.560 --> 43:30.240
were different from the UX goals that GNOME has.

43:30.240 --> 43:30.880
And that's fine.

43:30.880 --> 43:33.480
It's just a different target market.

43:33.480 --> 43:36.960
But we wanted to tailor the experience with your desktop

43:36.960 --> 43:39.480
towards that specific type of user.

43:39.480 --> 43:42.000
And so we started working on Cosmic as a way

43:42.000 --> 43:44.280
to bring those changes about and help cater

43:44.280 --> 43:48.560
to that type of person who's curious about those sort

43:48.560 --> 43:52.240
of specific modifications that make their particular lives

43:52.240 --> 43:55.480
easier using their computer for the things they use it for.

43:55.480 --> 43:57.240
And is it also a bit about maybe being

43:57.240 --> 44:00.080
able to offer a set of consistency to your customers?

44:00.080 --> 44:02.640
Because the Upstream project can change pretty radically,

44:02.640 --> 44:04.840
as it did between 38 and 40.

44:04.840 --> 44:06.800
And there's sort of a layer of consistency

44:06.800 --> 44:09.640
if the shell they're using is Cosmic.

44:09.640 --> 44:12.280
I'm not sure that that's the primary goal.

44:12.280 --> 44:15.120
I mean, I think that you're definitely not

44:15.120 --> 44:20.640
going to see as big of a shift going from Cosmic on 338

44:20.640 --> 44:24.720
to Cosmic on GNOME 40 whatever, just because we're

44:24.720 --> 44:28.720
trying to maintain a certain set of Cosmic experiences.

44:28.720 --> 44:32.280
But at the same time, we don't necessarily

44:32.280 --> 44:36.080
want to hold people back on something if it's not as good.

44:36.080 --> 44:41.560
And if we find a radically different UX pattern that

44:41.560 --> 44:44.560
helps tremendously with usability or discoverability,

44:44.560 --> 44:46.920
something like that, we're not necessarily

44:46.920 --> 44:48.700
going to shy away from implementing that,

44:48.700 --> 44:50.040
even though that's a big change.

44:50.040 --> 44:51.920
And you might otherwise have more consistency

44:51.920 --> 44:55.600
going with the one Upstream to the next Upstream release.

44:55.600 --> 44:58.380
But I guess that could be a nice benefit

44:58.380 --> 45:01.000
for this particular release.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.680
It's going to smooth the transition from 338 to 40

45:04.680 --> 45:05.600
a little bit more.

45:05.600 --> 45:06.520
I would imagine, yeah.

45:06.520 --> 45:12.480
But it's not necessarily the end goal.

45:12.480 --> 45:14.140
We want to make the best experience.

45:14.140 --> 45:16.160
We don't necessarily want to make

45:16.160 --> 45:19.960
experiences that are stagnant or that stay the same.

45:19.960 --> 45:23.120
Consistency can be really good for UX and discoverability.

45:23.120 --> 45:26.240
But sometimes there's a pattern that works better.

45:26.240 --> 45:30.080
And we shouldn't be afraid to deviate from existing norms,

45:30.080 --> 45:32.840
because sometimes you want something better.

45:32.840 --> 45:35.160
And if you never change what you're at,

45:35.160 --> 45:36.920
you're never going to get anything better.

45:36.920 --> 45:37.760
Well said.

45:37.760 --> 45:39.160
Well, Ian, thank you for joining us.

45:39.160 --> 45:40.860
And also, thank you for hosting us here.

45:40.860 --> 45:41.800
This has been great.

45:41.800 --> 45:42.280
Absolutely.

45:42.280 --> 45:45.120
This is the first show I've done in weeks with ethernet.

45:45.120 --> 45:45.620
Yeah.

45:45.620 --> 45:46.120
So thank you.

45:46.120 --> 45:46.640
Oh, no.

45:46.640 --> 45:47.160
Yeah.

45:47.160 --> 45:48.880
Nice to have you guys.

45:48.880 --> 45:52.040
And always, always a pleasure.

45:52.040 --> 45:53.400
Cassidy, welcome back to the show.

45:53.400 --> 45:54.880
It's just been like a couple of days,

45:54.880 --> 45:56.560
it feels like, since we shared it last.

45:56.560 --> 45:58.140
Well, yeah, just one week, I guess, huh?

45:58.140 --> 46:01.240
How has the post-Elementary OS 6 release gone?

46:01.240 --> 46:01.960
It's gone well.

46:01.960 --> 46:07.720
It's been hard to like, I don't know what time is anymore.

46:07.720 --> 46:10.600
This last week, I've put in so much time just

46:10.600 --> 46:15.680
combing through social media and emails and issue reports.

46:15.680 --> 46:18.120
And it's fun when a new release comes out,

46:18.120 --> 46:19.400
because you get this flood.

46:19.400 --> 46:20.200
Yeah, I bet.

46:20.200 --> 46:22.160
Because it's just new and fresh and different.

46:22.160 --> 46:25.600
But then also, it's like, oh, my gosh, there's so much stuff

46:25.600 --> 46:27.360
to take in and address.

46:27.360 --> 46:28.880
It must be a lot to churn through, too,

46:28.880 --> 46:30.720
as you're actually trying to weigh out

46:30.720 --> 46:33.000
what's first impressions versus things that we really

46:33.000 --> 46:34.160
want to focus on later.

46:34.160 --> 46:34.660
Yeah.

46:34.660 --> 46:37.520
Yeah, and it's a huge flood of new users, too.

46:37.520 --> 46:40.320
So it's people who either have never used Elementary OS before

46:40.320 --> 46:42.680
or haven't used it for years, and they're coming back.

46:42.680 --> 46:45.360
And so then these are people who aren't,

46:45.360 --> 46:48.000
they don't know what issues have been filed already.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.120
So they're filing tons of duplicates.

46:50.120 --> 46:52.160
And we're doing our best to hold their hand

46:52.160 --> 46:54.200
to help them file in the right places and stuff.

46:54.200 --> 46:56.800
But inevitably, it's just like a flood.

46:56.800 --> 46:57.440
Noobs.

46:57.440 --> 46:57.840
Yeah.

46:57.840 --> 46:58.720
It's a good problem to have.

46:58.720 --> 46:59.880
It's a great problem to have.

46:59.880 --> 47:02.000
I'm super proud that that is, on release day,

47:02.000 --> 47:04.600
we get all these people who email us.

47:04.600 --> 47:05.840
They reply to their receipt.

47:05.840 --> 47:07.680
So when you buy it on the website,

47:07.680 --> 47:09.080
you can reply to your receipt.

47:09.080 --> 47:11.160
So that's one of the little perks you get for paying.

47:11.160 --> 47:13.160
And we'll do our best to help you out or point you

47:13.160 --> 47:14.200
in the right direction.

47:14.200 --> 47:17.160
And so they'll be like, hey.

47:17.160 --> 47:19.080
So I discovered after purchasing this

47:19.080 --> 47:21.040
that it's based on this thing called Linux.

47:21.040 --> 47:22.880
And we're like, yes, you're the best.

47:22.880 --> 47:24.560
Wow, how do you suppose they found you?

47:24.560 --> 47:25.360
That's incredible.

47:25.360 --> 47:26.080
I don't know.

47:26.080 --> 47:28.720
We have articles in Ars Technica and stuff and Wired.

47:28.720 --> 47:31.560
So I think there's some of that.

47:31.560 --> 47:34.560
There's the tech enthusiast bubble that's like,

47:34.560 --> 47:37.040
Linux is a small bubble inside of that bubble.

47:37.040 --> 47:40.660
And so we're kind of leaking out into the more mainstream,

47:40.660 --> 47:42.280
I guess, which is always cool.

47:42.280 --> 47:46.040
I felt like I saw a lot more people in our Telegram channel

47:46.040 --> 47:48.000
talking about it and trying it out this release.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.360
It seemed like people were ready.

47:50.360 --> 47:52.960
And some of the stuff really resonated with them.

47:52.960 --> 47:54.160
Yeah, a lot of curiosity.

47:54.160 --> 47:56.400
And I think especially the Flatpaks speak

47:56.400 --> 47:58.320
to folks who maybe are experienced Linux users

47:58.320 --> 48:00.040
but haven't dabbled in elementary for a while.

48:00.040 --> 48:00.680
Yeah, yeah.

48:00.680 --> 48:03.120
And it's such a great, one of the biggest things

48:03.120 --> 48:05.520
we've heard as feedback is because we've decided to stick

48:05.520 --> 48:07.960
to the LTS basis because of the stability.

48:07.960 --> 48:09.800
People are like, oh, Ubuntu apps are outdated.

48:09.800 --> 48:12.520
So Flatpak kind of solves that.

48:12.520 --> 48:14.120
You've got your development libraries,

48:14.120 --> 48:15.680
which if you're doing web development,

48:15.680 --> 48:17.600
every web development library has

48:17.600 --> 48:19.680
you install their own package manager anyway.

48:19.680 --> 48:21.560
So you're not using the repo ones anyway.

48:21.560 --> 48:22.360
That's so true.

48:22.360 --> 48:23.600
It's something we don't talk about.

48:23.600 --> 48:24.920
Nobody acknowledges that, really.

48:24.920 --> 48:27.160
Yeah, it's like you've got every single programming language

48:27.160 --> 48:28.160
has its own packaging manager.

48:28.160 --> 48:29.680
So at that point, it doesn't really

48:29.680 --> 48:31.800
matter if those languages aren't totally up to date

48:31.800 --> 48:32.320
in the base.

48:32.320 --> 48:34.280
And then you've got your Flatpak apps on top.

48:34.280 --> 48:36.680
And so you've got a stable base and bleeding edge apps.

48:36.680 --> 48:38.360
And it's kind of a great world to be in.

48:38.360 --> 48:40.600
Yeah, with a nice, clean UI sitting on top of all of it.

48:40.600 --> 48:41.120
Yeah.

48:41.120 --> 48:43.960
Yeah, Wes and I, we gave it a go for Linux Action News.

48:43.960 --> 48:45.120
And we both walked away.

48:45.120 --> 48:45.920
We hadn't talked about it.

48:45.920 --> 48:47.560
And we both walked away from it going,

48:47.560 --> 48:48.800
this is like professional grade now.

48:48.800 --> 48:50.360
It's a professional workstation OS.

48:50.360 --> 48:52.200
With that combination that you just

48:52.200 --> 48:54.680
touched on with the base of LTS, but the freshness

48:54.680 --> 48:56.200
of the user land, and the cleanness of it,

48:56.200 --> 48:58.800
and also some of the work you guys did with notifications

48:58.800 --> 49:00.420
in the terminal, and that kind of stuff.

49:00.420 --> 49:02.680
It just makes all of that a little bit smoother.

49:02.680 --> 49:03.160
Yeah.

49:03.160 --> 49:06.600
Yeah, there's been lots and lots of new little quality

49:06.600 --> 49:09.080
of life features and things we've put into this release.

49:09.080 --> 49:11.320
So that's been really fun to get to that point

49:11.320 --> 49:11.920
where we can do that.

49:11.920 --> 49:14.760
We're going like, we know how to build an OS now.

49:14.760 --> 49:15.960
We've got the basics down.

49:15.960 --> 49:17.920
And now we can work on those quality of life things.

49:17.920 --> 49:18.440
Yeah.

49:18.440 --> 49:21.320
So have you been running it on your framework laptop?

49:21.320 --> 49:23.280
I have been running it on my framework laptop.

49:23.280 --> 49:26.040
Yeah, cat's out of the bag there.

49:26.040 --> 49:28.640
The framework's out, so I can talk about it now.

49:28.640 --> 49:30.280
I've been testing a, it's technically

49:30.280 --> 49:31.400
a pre-production model.

49:31.400 --> 49:33.440
So I can't share exact impressions

49:33.440 --> 49:37.360
of that specific fit and finish, but it's really cool.

49:37.360 --> 49:42.160
It's a really cool project, really cool product itself.

49:42.160 --> 49:46.680
Yeah, the hardware is way, it's super nice, super rigid.

49:46.680 --> 49:48.640
Fit and finish is really good.

49:48.640 --> 49:49.200
That's great.

49:49.200 --> 49:51.400
I have one major complaint, though.

49:51.400 --> 49:53.720
The screen resolution is wrong.

49:53.720 --> 49:56.160
OK, so remind me, I seem to recall

49:56.160 --> 49:57.880
it was like an interesting aspect ratio, right?

49:57.880 --> 49:59.160
It's 3 by 2, which is fine.

49:59.160 --> 50:01.640
I actually kind of really like that now.

50:01.640 --> 50:02.760
Yeah, I think I would too.

50:02.760 --> 50:04.200
I've seen people kind of whatever

50:04.200 --> 50:06.640
who are like die-hard fans of like the 16 by 10

50:06.640 --> 50:07.800
or like the 3 by 2 ratios.

50:07.800 --> 50:08.760
It's like, yeah, whatever.

50:08.760 --> 50:09.720
Like, OK, now I see it.

50:09.720 --> 50:11.720
I don't actually watch that much video on my laptop.

50:11.720 --> 50:13.440
I do a lot more coding and web browsing.

50:13.440 --> 50:14.600
I want some height.

50:14.600 --> 50:16.400
Yeah, it's actually, that's fine.

50:16.400 --> 50:18.000
No, the ratio's fine.

50:18.000 --> 50:25.760
The resolution is like 2,256 by 1,504 at 13 and 1 half inches,

50:25.760 --> 50:27.000
somewhere around there.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.920
So it's like native resolution, everything's tiny,

50:29.920 --> 50:31.240
way too small.

50:31.240 --> 50:34.160
2x scaling, everything's Fisher-Price giant,

50:34.160 --> 50:36.600
huge, chunky, chunky giant.

50:36.600 --> 50:40.560
1.5x scaling, if you've ever followed me on the internet,

50:40.560 --> 50:42.360
half pixels are a lie.

50:42.360 --> 50:43.740
They don't exist.

50:43.740 --> 50:47.200
Even if your software supports it, well, best case scenario,

50:47.200 --> 50:49.240
you have a one pixel line that's drawn by an app,

50:49.240 --> 50:51.900
and it has to decide if that's drawn over one pixel or two

50:51.900 --> 50:54.160
pixels, and it ends up being blurry.

50:54.160 --> 50:57.840
So by having a higher than 1x ratio, but not quite 2x,

50:57.840 --> 51:00.560
you end up actually with blurriness at the pixel level.

51:00.560 --> 51:01.200
So.

51:01.200 --> 51:02.920
This is the exact problem I have on my ThinkPad,

51:02.920 --> 51:03.760
and it drives me crazy.

51:03.760 --> 51:04.480
It's so, yeah.

51:04.480 --> 51:07.960
And like you can work, 1.5, like fractional scaling

51:07.960 --> 51:10.680
is a hardware workaround.

51:10.680 --> 51:13.240
And I understand that it has to exist for that reason,

51:13.240 --> 51:13.940
but it shouldn't.

51:13.940 --> 51:16.120
If you're making a new computer, you

51:16.120 --> 51:19.960
don't choose a resolution where you need fractional scaling.

51:19.960 --> 51:22.840
So that's my big downside on this laptop,

51:22.840 --> 51:25.300
but I've worked around it.

51:25.300 --> 51:27.340
Elementary OS doesn't natively support fractional scaling

51:27.340 --> 51:28.720
at this point, because we're on X,

51:28.720 --> 51:32.160
and there are some ways to do it, but it's kind of hacky.

51:32.160 --> 51:33.960
What we could possibly do is somebody

51:33.960 --> 51:37.080
could spin a framework image that includes some of the hacks,

51:37.080 --> 51:39.480
whatever, as out of the box and supported.

51:39.480 --> 51:40.960
Curious about those modules, though.

51:40.960 --> 51:44.920
I mean, as far as the OS thinks, they're just like USB C

51:44.920 --> 51:45.480
devices, right?

51:45.480 --> 51:46.120
Brilliant.

51:46.120 --> 51:47.600
I want to see everybody adopt the modules.

51:47.600 --> 51:49.280
Like, System76, if you're making a laptop,

51:49.280 --> 51:51.960
adopt those modules, because they're freaking brilliant.

51:51.960 --> 51:55.320
They're USB, I think they're USB 4, and it has four of them,

51:55.320 --> 51:56.480
and they're all full power.

51:56.480 --> 51:59.120
They all support the whole protocol.

51:59.120 --> 52:03.800
They all support the whole display input or output

52:03.800 --> 52:06.200
and power input and everything, fast charging.

52:06.200 --> 52:08.000
It's not like some of them are limited.

52:08.000 --> 52:08.840
You can put whatever.

52:08.840 --> 52:10.680
It's all mix and match.

52:10.680 --> 52:11.200
That's great.

52:11.200 --> 52:12.920
So the cards that I got, they just

52:12.920 --> 52:16.760
sent me were like a full size HDMI, just a USB C pass

52:16.760 --> 52:22.240
through, a mini SD card slot, which I think is interesting,

52:22.240 --> 52:24.880
and a, what was the last one?

52:24.880 --> 52:26.720
Oh, and a storage card, which I think

52:26.720 --> 52:28.400
is actually probably the most brilliant.

52:28.400 --> 52:30.920
It's just like a flash drive that

52:30.920 --> 52:32.040
embeds into your laptop.

52:32.040 --> 52:35.960
So it's a 250 gig flash storage that you can just pop out,

52:35.960 --> 52:37.160
and it has USB C on the end.

52:37.160 --> 52:39.800
So then you can plug it in your phone or any other computer.

52:39.800 --> 52:40.400
Wow.

52:40.400 --> 52:41.960
And that part, I was like, I've probably

52:41.960 --> 52:43.920
used that one the most, because I'm like, oh.

52:43.920 --> 52:46.400
I hadn't even thought about the phone thing.

52:46.400 --> 52:49.760
Yeah, or I've used the HDMI one to plug into another laptop

52:49.760 --> 52:53.040
to get an extra HDMI output, because it's over USB C.

52:53.040 --> 52:54.600
So it's like a display port, whatever.

52:54.600 --> 52:56.800
So it's like dongles, but built in.

52:56.800 --> 52:59.160
As stupid as that sounds, it's kind of brilliant.

52:59.160 --> 53:01.080
If you're going to do the dongle life, that's the way to do it.

53:01.080 --> 53:01.960
That's just really embracing.

53:01.960 --> 53:02.520
Wow.

53:02.520 --> 53:04.800
I never thought about using them on other systems like that.

53:04.800 --> 53:05.480
That is great.

53:05.480 --> 53:09.920
So now I always have these four USB C dongles, basically,

53:09.920 --> 53:11.720
with me, because they're built into my laptop.

53:11.720 --> 53:12.920
But I can plug them into other devices.

53:12.920 --> 53:16.280
I mean, just today, Ryan, we're scrambling here at System76

53:16.280 --> 53:17.480
to try to figure out recording.

53:17.480 --> 53:19.080
And we had to figure out some dongles

53:19.080 --> 53:21.080
to get hardwired ethernet.

53:21.080 --> 53:23.520
Yeah, they talked about doing one ethernet.

53:23.520 --> 53:25.960
It's thin enough they'd have to do the flip down door thing.

53:25.960 --> 53:28.320
But that's why, if you don't need ethernet,

53:28.320 --> 53:29.280
you don't buy that card.

53:29.280 --> 53:31.520
If you need ethernet, you can build it into your laptop.

53:31.520 --> 53:32.520
I think it's so smart.

53:32.520 --> 53:35.240
I just want to see a laptop with six of these.

53:35.240 --> 53:37.600
Just give me six freaking full-powered ports,

53:37.600 --> 53:39.880
and I can put whatever ports I want in them.

53:39.880 --> 53:42.040
And half of them will probably be USB 3.0 for me.

53:42.040 --> 53:45.320
But when I want to swap in whatever port, I can have it.

53:45.320 --> 53:49.160
So rumor has it Westpane may eventually receive one.

53:49.160 --> 53:51.720
It's sort of bad timing, because he's on the trip right now

53:51.720 --> 53:53.200
when they would be shipping it to him.

53:53.200 --> 53:55.520
Yeah, it's a little dicey receiving the package.

53:55.520 --> 53:56.080
We'll see.

53:56.080 --> 53:57.360
We'll see.

53:57.360 --> 54:00.600
But I can't wait to hear more people's thoughts on it.

54:00.600 --> 54:03.980
I was concerned that this was kind of like a Kickstarter

54:03.980 --> 54:06.640
scammy kind of thing, although it felt pretty legit.

54:06.640 --> 54:08.520
But I was just a little concerned.

54:08.520 --> 54:10.720
It felt like it came out of nowhere in some sense.

54:10.720 --> 54:12.720
Now, if you follow the people behind the project,

54:12.720 --> 54:14.040
you realize they've been doing some of these things

54:14.040 --> 54:14.800
for a long time.

54:14.800 --> 54:17.120
But just being a layperson, it was like,

54:17.120 --> 54:18.600
these are lofty goals.

54:18.600 --> 54:19.720
You're really trying hard.

54:19.720 --> 54:22.160
And you're trying to speak my language.

54:22.160 --> 54:23.360
Who can do this?

54:23.360 --> 54:25.200
And we've seen other companies that

54:25.200 --> 54:27.620
are bigger and well-known do similar things.

54:27.620 --> 54:29.240
There's the whole Project Aria, or whatever

54:29.240 --> 54:31.800
it was, at the modular phone.

54:31.800 --> 54:34.080
Motorola did their Motorola phone mods.

54:34.080 --> 54:36.000
And these are big companies.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.200
Because I think the Aria was Google, I think.

54:38.200 --> 54:39.400
But these are big companies who have

54:39.400 --> 54:40.780
tried this whole modular approach,

54:40.780 --> 54:42.600
and it basically never panned out.

54:42.600 --> 54:45.280
And I think if they would have said,

54:45.280 --> 54:48.840
oh, the CPU itself is on its own modular platform,

54:48.840 --> 54:51.080
I'd be like, yeah, that's probably not going to pan out.

54:51.080 --> 54:52.780
But even just the expansion cards,

54:52.780 --> 54:55.040
and then being able to easily access

54:55.040 --> 54:59.480
the RAM, and Wi-Fi, and storage, and stuff,

54:59.480 --> 55:02.480
and making the physical design of the hardware

55:02.480 --> 55:05.480
super easy to open with captive screws and magnets,

55:05.480 --> 55:07.720
there's a lot of smart decisions that even if they went,

55:07.720 --> 55:11.280
like, upside down today, this laptop is still useful.

55:11.280 --> 55:13.200
You could still upgrade it over the years.

55:13.200 --> 55:15.280
And I think that's really cool and important, too.

55:15.280 --> 55:16.480
Cassidy, thank you, sir.

55:16.480 --> 55:18.280
Yeah.

55:18.280 --> 55:19.740
Carl, welcome back to the show.

55:19.740 --> 55:22.280
It feels like it's been a couple of years since we've talked.

55:22.280 --> 55:23.960
It's been way too long, that's for sure.

55:23.960 --> 55:24.520
It has.

55:24.520 --> 55:26.160
And the last time I was here, there

55:26.160 --> 55:29.680
was not nearly as many people or things.

55:29.680 --> 55:30.920
Where are you fitting everything?

55:30.920 --> 55:31.560
It's changed.

55:31.560 --> 55:33.000
Well, we're not.

55:33.000 --> 55:33.720
That's the thing.

55:33.720 --> 55:37.320
So I think it's changed a lot since, well,

55:37.320 --> 55:38.760
but since you were here.

55:38.760 --> 55:40.440
Yeah, we were both back here.

55:40.440 --> 55:41.560
The Thaleo launch, I think?

55:41.560 --> 55:42.560
2018 fall.

55:42.560 --> 55:43.040
Yeah.

55:43.040 --> 55:44.960
Wow, really?

55:44.960 --> 55:48.720
Yeah, so time is moving at a different rate now, isn't it?

55:48.720 --> 55:50.160
It's kind of confusing.

55:50.160 --> 55:54.400
I think of things now with pre-COVID, COVID spike one,

55:54.400 --> 55:57.000
things are going to be great, COVID spike two.

55:57.000 --> 55:57.760
Yeah.

55:57.760 --> 56:00.320
That's how I measure where I am in time.

56:00.320 --> 56:02.440
And we still don't even really know quite if we're, well,

56:02.440 --> 56:03.440
we're not through it yet.

56:03.440 --> 56:05.400
So we still don't really know where it's going.

56:05.400 --> 56:08.840
Has that impacted the business pretty significantly?

56:08.840 --> 56:10.040
It did.

56:10.040 --> 56:11.760
The one thing I could say is I was really

56:11.760 --> 56:15.600
proud of our entire team for how we adapted so quickly to it.

56:15.600 --> 56:17.720
We were pretty used to the engineering way

56:17.720 --> 56:21.800
of communicating through Slack and GitHub

56:21.800 --> 56:23.400
and those type of things.

56:23.400 --> 56:26.020
And so by the time we all moved to our homes to work,

56:26.020 --> 56:28.120
we realized we weren't actually talking to each other in person

56:28.120 --> 56:28.600
anyway.

56:28.600 --> 56:29.800
You're already using the tools.

56:29.800 --> 56:30.300
Right.

56:30.300 --> 56:31.040
Right.

56:31.040 --> 56:33.200
So we were building stuff that way anyway,

56:33.200 --> 56:34.960
even though we were much closer together.

56:34.960 --> 56:36.420
There are things we missed about it,

56:36.420 --> 56:39.640
but some teams really thrive remotely.

56:39.640 --> 56:43.720
The product engineering team is just doing fantastic.

56:43.720 --> 56:45.680
Then we learned that the technical support team,

56:45.680 --> 56:47.180
who I thought this whole time really

56:47.180 --> 56:49.480
needed to be very close to the lab,

56:49.480 --> 56:52.400
could actually thrive working remote

56:52.400 --> 56:54.560
if they had support from the QA team who had lab.

56:54.560 --> 56:56.840
So that ended up working really well.

56:56.840 --> 56:59.840
And so we learned a lot as a company because we

56:59.840 --> 57:01.200
used to hire people, and everyone

57:01.200 --> 57:02.200
had to come to Colorado.

57:02.200 --> 57:05.400
And then we started just hiring anywhere in the United States.

57:05.400 --> 57:07.520
And all of a sudden, it was a lot faster

57:07.520 --> 57:08.480
to hire, a lot easier.

57:08.480 --> 57:09.920
A lot more people to choose from.

57:09.920 --> 57:11.880
A lot more people, right.

57:11.880 --> 57:13.800
So that's a change that's going to stay, you think?

57:13.800 --> 57:14.320
Certainly.

57:14.320 --> 57:14.880
Yeah.

57:14.880 --> 57:15.520
Wow.

57:15.520 --> 57:16.680
That is a big change for you.

57:16.680 --> 57:21.000
Yeah, we found that we, in many respects,

57:21.000 --> 57:23.360
were operating faster and better.

57:23.360 --> 57:25.520
It took some time to get used to.

57:25.520 --> 57:29.520
Things like Thaleo Mega, it was on the cusp of being released.

57:29.520 --> 57:31.600
And then we all went home and figuring

57:31.600 --> 57:33.960
how to design a hardware product remote

57:33.960 --> 57:34.920
was really challenging.

57:34.920 --> 57:36.520
That's what stands out to me here is, right,

57:36.520 --> 57:38.160
you've kind of got different sides of your business.

57:38.160 --> 57:39.560
Sure, you've got customer support.

57:39.560 --> 57:42.040
You've got the more traditional software side of the house.

57:42.040 --> 57:45.000
But then you're building physical hardware here.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.160
How do you make that work?

57:46.160 --> 57:48.560
Well, I can tell you the beginning was very frightening

57:48.560 --> 57:51.560
because we thought they were going to shut us down and send

57:51.560 --> 57:52.520
us home, right?

57:52.520 --> 57:54.760
I mean, all these businesses were being closed.

57:54.760 --> 57:58.160
So that's a frightening prospect to face.

57:58.160 --> 58:01.960
And then we learned that we were considered essential

58:01.960 --> 58:03.920
because with work from home, computers

58:03.920 --> 58:06.400
were necessary to support that.

58:06.400 --> 58:09.000
And so then it meant all the mitigation factors

58:09.000 --> 58:13.800
to make it possible for us to be a safe place

58:13.800 --> 58:15.120
to work during a pandemic.

58:15.120 --> 58:16.120
Right, boy.

58:16.120 --> 58:18.040
So all the deaths were spread far apart.

58:18.040 --> 58:20.760
Everyone was in masks for over a year.

58:20.760 --> 58:22.800
And then finally, the vaccines came along.

58:22.800 --> 58:27.480
And everyone at the factory got vaccinated.

58:27.480 --> 58:31.760
And then the CDC said you could take your mask off.

58:31.760 --> 58:33.560
And all of a sudden, I saw these people

58:33.560 --> 58:36.140
that we had been hired and I've been working with for a year

58:36.140 --> 58:36.840
for the first time.

58:36.840 --> 58:38.160
Wow.

58:38.160 --> 58:39.960
Because I never actually had seen their faces.

58:39.960 --> 58:42.680
And it was liberating.

58:42.680 --> 58:43.960
What an experience.

58:43.960 --> 58:46.120
What a unique, you're going to remember that experience

58:46.120 --> 58:47.320
probably forever.

58:47.320 --> 58:48.640
Striking, yeah.

58:48.640 --> 58:50.680
And amongst all of this, too, there's

58:50.680 --> 58:52.480
the launch of the launch keyboard.

58:52.480 --> 58:53.000
Right.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.200
How did that get impacted by all of that?

58:55.200 --> 58:56.320
Everything slowed down.

58:56.320 --> 59:00.520
So that was the first part was, at least in the beginning.

59:00.520 --> 59:02.400
And then it began to accelerate again.

59:02.400 --> 59:05.200
And like everything in business, everything

59:05.200 --> 59:07.800
costs more and takes longer than you expect.

59:07.800 --> 59:10.440
And the supply shortages must have been horrible.

59:10.440 --> 59:11.840
Or probably still are, right?

59:11.840 --> 59:14.280
Yeah, I have a horror story for the launch for that one.

59:14.280 --> 59:17.360
So when we were ready to launch the product,

59:17.360 --> 59:21.280
we started with 500 because we didn't know what the sales were

59:21.280 --> 59:21.800
going to be.

59:21.800 --> 59:24.200
And we thought that we sold keyboards before,

59:24.200 --> 59:26.240
but we knew it wasn't a reflection of this product

59:26.240 --> 59:27.160
that we were building.

59:27.160 --> 59:29.160
It was something very different.

59:29.160 --> 59:31.040
But we didn't know quite what it would be.

59:31.040 --> 59:34.560
And 500, with our old thing that was just

59:34.560 --> 59:38.200
there for convenience with purchasing a computer,

59:38.200 --> 59:42.240
was it would be a hefty sales for us.

59:42.240 --> 59:45.480
And then we sold it, and then they were all gone in a day.

59:45.480 --> 59:46.360
Wow.

59:46.360 --> 59:50.360
And then so we needed to order more PCBs.

59:50.360 --> 59:52.720
We needed to increase our production.

59:52.720 --> 59:56.520
We went to order the PCBs, and one of the controllers

59:56.520 --> 59:57.760
was out of stock.

59:57.760 --> 01:00:02.440
So then we did the electrical engineering.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.520
Jeremy and Darrell worked on that

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.560
and made the modifications within a day.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.560
Looked at the spec sheets so that it would work.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:09.520
We went to do validation.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.680
We went to order them.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.320
Another part was out.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.320
We had to do it again.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.560
So we reworked the, this time it was a more important component

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:20.280
that required FCC and CE certification again.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.000
Oh, wow.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.360
So I mean, this isn't a small tweak.

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.160
You're redesigning it to some extent.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.800
That's such a serious decision, too.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:27.080
Yeah, they're not dropping it.

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.160
This was the USB controller.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.800
It's not just another drop in there.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.760
Some of the traces needed to be moved, and modifications made.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.140
We had to do a new certification.

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:35.800
We also had to do new validation.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.840
So that was the struggle.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.560
And so what we started doing, which

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.240
I think is natural for a lot of companies,

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.880
is we started hoarding parts.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.240
So we don't know what our sales are going to be.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.880
We know what it is already, but now we're

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.920
telling people it's going to be a couple of months for us

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:51.500
to catch up.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.760
And so we had to.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.200
So we started just buying lots and lots of parts.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.560
When you could get it, you got it.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.240
Yeah, and no one wants to operate that way.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.360
But now I'm thinking, we're doing this because we

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.080
want to secure our supply.

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:07.560
But at the same time, we're part of the problem,

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.680
just like all of us.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:09.840
Adding more stress to the system.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.000
Right, we're adding more stress because we're

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:11.780
buying more parts.

01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:15.120
But I don't know any way around it other than to do our best

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:17.640
to take care of our customers by buying those parts.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:20.320
Yeah, it seems like I bet just about everybody

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.480
is in that position.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.000
Right.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.520
And so it sort of, in a way, elongates the problem,

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.960
but there's no choice around it.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:27.440
You're right.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:27.960
Yeah.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:28.720
Man.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.360
It's tricky.

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:33.920
We hold ourselves as high ethical and moral grounds,

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.440
even with our partners, and think about these things

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.880
and our impact on the supply chain.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.800
And it's the Wild West today.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:46.400
So how much of a skill up was it to manufacture a keyboard?

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.120
Because I took a quick tour out there,

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.200
and it looks like that keyboard literally

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.800
starts as a block of aluminum.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:52.680
It is, right.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:55.600
It is simply a block of aluminum that gets milled

01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:00.840
into its shape, sandblasted, and painted, and parts.

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:02.280
That's a lot of equipment.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:02.840
Yeah.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:07.880
And we also don't have nearly the capacity we need either.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:11.520
So we bought another half million in equipment

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.640
that's coming in in the next few weeks,

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.960
just to ramp up production for launch itself.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.760
Where is it going to go?

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.200
You'll see tomorrow.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:19.960
All right.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:20.800
Wow.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:21.000
Yeah.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.560
I mean, I actually want to buy another launch keyboard.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.680
So you better get that ramped up.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.360
Yeah.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.240
We're getting there.

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:28.560
I think our goal is to get there for the Christmas season.

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:33.320
So mid to late October, we want to be in front of sales.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.360
Right now, we're shipping.

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.120
It's mid-August.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.400
We'll be able to ship by the end of September.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.880
I think we can get ahead of sales by mid to late October.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.400
Sure.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.400
The number one thing, I know you hear it, is, well, it's so expensive.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.680
I don't actually necessarily agree with that characterization,

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.880
because depending when you get into certain markets,

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.200
like headphones and keyboards, you can spend a lot of money.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:59.720
Is there a long-term System76 roadmap where a $100 launch is on that roadmap?

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:00.880
No.

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.880
Just can't build a keyboard good enough?

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.360
There is a roadmap for launch.

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.920
It just doesn't go down to $100.

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:09.280
I don't think that we can build a product that we would be

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:15.560
proud of that fits with the design and the characteristics of launch itself.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.560
We don't want the quality to be any lower.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.600
So there are things that we can do to bring the price down for another model.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:26.120
So the launch roadmap includes a model that's going to have a 10-key numpad.

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:31.240
So that'll be coming, I think, both of these are probably first half next year.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.120
So a 10-key, well, we've got to get a production up and running.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.160
And caught up.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:41.200
But the 10-key, and then another smaller, I believe it's 67-key,

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.800
which is going to remove the F row.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:48.080
So you'd hit the function row underneath the function key with 1, 2, 3, and so forth.

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.480
So an even smaller footprint.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.000
Right, an even smaller one.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.560
So that cuts out a bunch of switches.

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.320
We're also going to remove the hub from that.

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:57.240
And my hope is we can get that to $199.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:00.280
So yeah, the idea would be to be able to reach more customers that

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.600
need more things and a couple different price points.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:02.840
Right.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.400
Sounds like it might be a model I'd want to throw in my backpack to take with me,

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:05.900
too.

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:06.400
Yeah.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.760
Yeah, that's OK.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.080
I could really see that.

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.440
That's pretty great.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.780
Now, along with all of this, everything we've been talking about,

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.720
we've talked about equipment, and we talked about some hiring.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.280
You can use rough terms if you like.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.800
But how big are we looking now for the team size of System76?

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:23.440
I think we have 63 employees.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.520
Wow.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.520
Wow.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:28.800
Did you ever think?

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.560
Did you hope?

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.560
I don't know.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:34.600
The thing about making something like this is that you're so heads

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.640
down all the time that they don't think about it much.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.240
You're just solving problems.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:46.400
We do, we think long term, but the people that you're adding

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:51.520
just feel like a natural extension of this body we've made.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.920
It's a lot harder to communicate with 60 people than it is a dozen, though.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:58.720
Like that has a lot of challenges associated with that kind of growth.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:04:59.840
It does.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:03.680
But I think what's interesting is the team leaders and most of the teams

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.400
have been here for a long time.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:05.920
Right.

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:09.040
And so we were all the people that were part of that first 12

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:13.240
that built the ethos and the character and the voice

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.560
and culture of this company.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.080
And so I was actually just having a conversation earlier today

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.480
about this, funny enough.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.760
We had a new director of marketing start.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:24.240
And she said, you know, I've been all these different places,

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:29.080
and this place, everyone knows why they're here and what they're doing.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.360
And to me, that sounded strange that it's abnormal.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.840
Should just always be that way.

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:33.560
It is not.

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.060
It is.

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:34.560
Right.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:38.600
And I didn't add, thinking on it more, I

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:42.600
think it's because we have that core group that we, instead of,

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.600
I don't get up and do speeches or any of the things like that.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.520
I don't talk in Slack about our mission.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.600
I think we all just know it.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.320
And it's in part because the leadership team,

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.800
we've been together so long that it just flows to the people that

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.960
are growing the company.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.440
You're on the same page anyway.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.400
That's an interesting observation.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.880
And I would concur.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:06.560
From my perspective, I come back every couple of years,

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.520
and a lot of the core team members are still here.

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.240
And it's like catching up with old friends.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:11.940
And that's not true for other places I go.

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:13.800
Usually, it's a new set of faces.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.200
Maybe one or two people are still there.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.400
And I will also say that when we're out in private,

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.080
everybody always speaks very highly of you.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:26.400
So you've been able to foster, I don't know if loyalty is the right word,

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:29.080
but people genuinely seem to care, and they respect you,

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.840
and they bought into what is happening here.

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.240
And that seems unusually rare to me.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.040
We're the same people sitting here in this booth

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:40.000
that we are when we're having beers afterwards together.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.600
And that goes for our natural state is openness.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:49.600
Well, it also means you have had to adapt to accommodate some characters, too.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:54.440
Everybody here really feels like they're unique individuals that are not trying

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.240
to fit into some corporate mold.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.920
People are fully expressing themselves and their individuality.

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:02.760
And I could see that being tricky to accommodate sometimes.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:06.720
I think that's right, except when you have people that are securing themselves.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:12.200
So what ends up happening is you have a group of a team of smart people

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:15.120
that are both are secure in both their job and what they're doing

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.960
and their understanding of things.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.440
And their place in the whole mission.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:22.880
Right, to the extent that no idea is scary.

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.200
You will just simply recognize a better idea

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:30.520
because you understand what you're doing and what we're doing as a team.

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:35.160
So there's not a lot of, well, we might debate and talk through things.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:38.480
It's frictionless and kind of it just flows organically.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:41.240
There's not a bunch of politics or second guessing or posturing,

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:44.400
like you just kind of all, it seems like you guys trust each other.

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:44.920
Right.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:48.880
Now, the question is, as the company grows, can that be maintained?

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.080
Do you feel like it can?

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:53.720
So far, we've been able to do that.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:58.360
I don't see, I think about how we'll do that.

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:01.680
And we are hiring an HR manager with the idea

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:06.000
that that role is going to help onboard people with the culture

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.080
and the style and the way we work.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:11.000
So I guess we are growing up a little bit.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:11.360
Yeah.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.360
Thinking about those things.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.520
Make it a little bit of a process to make sure people are on board

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.080
and all of that.

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.480
That kind of makes sense as you grow, though.

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.880
Well, Carl, it's been great to catch up.

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.840
Thanks for joining us.

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.360
Thanks for having me.

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:23.640
Well, that'll do it for this very special episode.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:28.560
But if you do the Twitter thing, you can follow the show at Linux Unplugged.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.640
The whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:35.360
I'm at Wes Payne, and you're at Chris LAS.

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:37.880
And I have to say, there's a whole bunch of other podcasts

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.720
you heard from Alex, our self-hosted co-host.

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:41.480
There's Coda Radio over there.

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:43.680
And if you're not catching Linux Action News,

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:46.000
you're missing out on what's going on in the world of Linux

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.040
in terms of how it impacts the industry and your daily life.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.280
LinuxActionNews.com.

01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:50.920
Go get that.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.160
All of it's over at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.520
As for this year's show, yeah, we'll be live next week.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.880
We'd love to have you join us.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.200
See you next week.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.720
Same bat time, same bat station.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:04.240
But as for now, we are all done.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:07.480
Thank you so much for tuning this special episode of the Unplugged program.

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:10.200
Thank you to everybody who's reached out with messages of support

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:14.200
for this road trip or listeners who had a chance to do a micro meetup with us.

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:17.480
Those have been so much fun, more intimate settings.

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.120
We did a diner in Cheyenne recently.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.200
It was great.

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.320
Now I have spots to go visit when I return to these places as well.

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:24.920
But the trip does continue.

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.080
You can follow us at ColonyTracker.live.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.080
And then don't forget about that meetup.

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.120
If you're in the Denver area, it's this Friday

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.880
as we record at 4 PM to start trickling in after that

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.240
and come hang out with us.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.120
But that does wrap up this edition of the Unplugged program.

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.000
Thank you, everyone, so much for tuning in.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.800
And we'll see you back here next Tuesday.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:10:11.280
Signing off.

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.280
You
