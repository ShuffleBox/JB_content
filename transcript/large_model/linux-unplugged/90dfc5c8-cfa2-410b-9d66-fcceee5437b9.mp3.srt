1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,960
Speaking of how great Windows is

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,080
There is a new subreddit that it chronicles the most public blue screens of death ever and at first I was like oh, haha

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:15,040
That's old joke, but actually some of these are really good really really good like hey Wes check out

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,280
Take a look at this picture here

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,960
I don't even know what this is but look how fancy that is that's in a mall

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,360
Where they have like a twisted display and the twisted display blue screen

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,400
I'd be really curious to see what that looks like when it works. Yeah, right every fifth

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,440
Look at this guy sitting there and a massive blue screen right there on that screen. It's almost like art

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,700
It is kind of like art. It is kind of beautiful in a way

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,660
Yeah, giant giant blue screens giant blue screens, so there is a subreddit now

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,560
Dedicated to the most epic blue screens ever and if you check it out

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,700
I'll have a link in the show notes some of these are kind of artistic in their own way

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,720
The blue screen of death is in its own way gotten its own

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,320
Its own status in popular culture so in fairness. Do we need to spin up a Linux kernel crash?

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,840
subreddit right right

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,500
No, it's not the blue screen. We don't have the blue. Yeah, yeah, although something went something went wrong with your computer

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,320
Is the new error message?

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,360
Yes, there's my poster photo that said it was just a big word that said error you have an error

19
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,640
Thanks

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,760
This is really this is really I love the caption for this Ars Technica photo

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,720
So this is the mall one again. We have these wrap displays, and it says malls can they get any more soulless

22
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
Yes, thanks to the blue screen of death

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,240
Yeah, that's pretty awful mmm. That's pretty gross

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,460
You know what I want an ARM powered Linux laptop Linus says it's gonna happen, but maybe not in 2016

25
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,680
He's looking for it though. He said that at Linux con in Europe

26
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,760
He said that I'm happy to see that arm is making progress one of these days

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,320
I will actually have a machine with ARM that they said it would be this year

28
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,700
Maybe it'll be next year 2016 will be the year of the ARM laptop

29
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,640
I don't know actually that's a good question. I don't think so

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,640
I think when Linus says that he's talking about something kind of along the lines of the MacBook Air that you just buy yeah

31
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,640
And it runs consumer easy-peasy

32
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,180
We're starting to see a higher end Chromebooks now. I mean yeah, yeah

33
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:19,940
You know who's gonna try to compete with a $500 Chromebook with an arm chip instead of an Intel CPU

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,100
You know I was on

35
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,740
Yeah, I would rather have it run the Linux really I mean much much rather I was on tech talk today

36
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,200
I was talking about these high-tech nomadic

37
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,060
That are are living off the grid quote-unquote they're staying connected to the internet

38
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,260
But living off the grid and one of them is you guys may know of him as Joey Hess

39
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,520
He is a Debian software developer. He I'm not sure if he's currently with the Debian project

40
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,580
But he did help develop the Debian installer. He created git annex. He's nice. Yeah

41
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,100
He's working on a software that uses Dropbox

42
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:00,800
Git and a few other things to sync all of your dot files between all of your Linux machines right like wouldn't that be nice?

43
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,340
So Joey he is an interesting individual because he pines

44
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:13,700
He says he pines for an ARM based Linux laptop because he's using a Dell Mini 9. He's been using it since 2008

45
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:19,300
He's worn out two keyboards. He's gone through two SSDs. He's upgraded it to two gigabytes of RAM and

46
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,620
He lives

47
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,020
Totally off the grid he has solar power on a good day

48
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:31,140
he says he gets 50 amp hours, but on most days he gets 15 amp hour 15 amp hours and

49
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,940
He says he's when power is low he often hacks in the evenings by lantern light

50
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,780
That's adorable, and he says he would kill

51
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,980
Kill for a powerful ARM based laptop something that would you know use way less power?

52
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,300
Right exactly that was what I was gonna say is when I say ARM laptop. I want something that's significantly fast

53
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,580
You know yeah, well you could you do you have your average everyday expectations met yeah?

54
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,700
I mean it doesn't have to be doesn't have to be a screamer

55
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,540
But you know here

56
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,740
I am a few months into this XPS 13 that I have and it's got a core i7 quote-unquote mobile processor

57
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,820
Which is actually a dual core processor with hyper threading that makes it look like four cores

58
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:19,660
I don't know why that's called an i7, but apparently in laptop jargon that qualifies as an i7 and you know I notice it I

59
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:25,160
notice I it's been a while since I've you know use a dual core as my daily driver and I

60
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:32,320
I don't know. It's still a really nice performing machine. Yep, but it's also my newest computer, and it's not my fastest computer

61
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,660
That's a little disappointing. It's a but it's a bummer. It's a bummer

62
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:41,720
That's precisely because Intel's been focusing on power management last couple of and I I appreciate I get four or five hours of battery life

63
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,680
I do appreciate that that makes a difference

64
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,240
But the reality is if I can if I'm sitting here with a quote-unquote i7 and an SSD

65
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,440
And I'm going not fast enough. There's no way arm

66
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,520
Failed that yeah, the arms just arms not gonna be fast enough for me for a while

67
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,280
I don't think I yeah, you want you do have higher expectations than

68
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,600
Terminal based probably I mean I would claim that Intel has maintained a lead because of their manufacturing prowess

69
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,020
And now they've stumbled with the latest you know process node

70
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,960
So is this the point where arm catches up maybe and if you go like West saying you know if you're doing terminal development

71
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,120
Maybe you have a web browser and email, and that's just about it

72
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,520
If you can tell me here's an arm computer that doesn't need to be charged for 10 13 hours, so that runs Linux

73
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,000
That would be very very tempting when I'm off-grid that would be very very tempting

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,080
Yeah, or your arm computer is well not for off-grid, but your arm computer is your interface to a droplet in the cloud

75
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,480
Yeah, exactly he so Joey says I seem to live half the time out of range of broadband and still use dial-up

76
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,160
He uses dial-up two gigs of RAM dial-up. Yeah, so I'm fully adapted to asynchronous communication

77
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,540
I download my mail with offline IMAP as well as blogs get converted to RSS to email

78
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,600
I use a distributed version control

79
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,100
Extensively and use my git annex to maintain large quantities of local data and cube large files to transfer in rare times

80
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,520
When I'm around fast internet, that's really neat. That's really neat

81
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:15,200
This is Linux unplugged episode 114 for October 13th 2015

82
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
Welcome to Linux unplugged your

83
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,680
Weekly Linux talk show that is drinking dawn of the red and Indian style pale ale. That's right

84
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,720
My name is Chris and my name is Wes. Hey, Wes. You are the you're the good soldier here that brought these dawn of the

85
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,480
Red I've never even seen this before I hadn't either

86
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,280
What do you think coming out of Eugene, Oregon a local brewery and look at that a 7% alcohol?

87
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,600
Whoo, this will be a fun one guys. Is this my second or third?

88
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Better not tell yeah, okay

89
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,680
I will cover it up on this week's episode of Linux unplugged

90
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,480
There is a KD elephant in the room a big plasma monster

91
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:05,040
we're gonna talk about that today and some accusations being thrown around some new application updates coming out and all of that goodness from

92
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,040
the plasma folks as well as

93
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
What I believe is the one true

94
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,480
The one true ring no

95
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,680
I'm kidding the one true form of integration or whatever you want to call it canonical calls it convergence

96
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,600
Microsoft calls it. I think continuity or continuity or something like that. I

97
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,900
Actually think there's something here today that we all could install you don't even have to be a KDE desktop user

98
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,380
To take advantage of a really slick integration between your phone and your desktop. You don't need a dock

99
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,520
You don't need any special set it already. We'll tell you about it. Yeah, and then later on in the show

100
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,300
I've been looking at options

101
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:44,220
Something easy to recommend to people that is an open source to drop in set and forget it a router for the home

102
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:52,260
That gets updates that stays secure that uses software. We can trust we're gonna talk about that today in the show as well and then

103
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,740
Then we're gonna see if we can end curses all of the things

104
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:03,420
King Looper put us to the challenge and wants us to end curses all of the things every last thing every last damn thing damn

105
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,740
Yeah, we're gonna do it with the help of the mumble room. That's right

106
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,380
Well, actually with soul reliance on the mumble room

107
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:15,300
We have a couple of suggestions, but this is a mumble room app pick segment that we'll be getting to which was requested by the mumble

108
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,300
Well, there you go. They get what they want

109
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,100
Yeah, now it's coming to you. All right, and speaking of the mumble room, let's bring them in time appropriate greetings virtual log

110
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,700
Zombies don't run Linux. It's good to have you there Danica's in there too. That's good. I love guys

111
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,740
So I just really quickly a bit of Katie follow-up, you know

112
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,380
The guys over at the Katie project are doing things in an interesting way

113
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,580
You got the plasma desktop and you got the Katie applications and all this different stuff

114
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:47,380
It's a whole set of applications and the Katie applications 1508 just got a release today

115
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,260
as we are recording this release contains bug fixes translation updates a

116
00:08:52,820 --> 00:09:00,340
Nice update a good safe update for everybody if you use arc or Kate or Katie PIM or localize any of that stuff

117
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,980
This is a great update. Plus this release also includes long-term support versions of the KD development platform for dot 14 dot

118
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:13,720
13 and I'm gonna underscore that Katie 4.14 dot 13 is still getting updates

119
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:21,980
The reason I'm going to underscore that is because that brings us to our first bit of feedback from KN RO in the Linux action

120
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,860
Show subreddit does lass hate Katie

121
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:33,060
Some strong words. Yeah, so I just listened episode 386 of lass and while they were covering Linux usage at the very large array

122
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,980
Chris noted that it's probably red hat with Katie and then no it just couldn't help himself but claiming the Katie is a strange desktop

123
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:44,860
For such an environment. I mean what the hell laughs. This is not the first anti Katie sentiment that I have heard on the show

124
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,340
I mean, I know you're narrow your gnome fanboys

125
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:53,140
But can you just try to stray a little bit towards neutral if the Linux action show not the gnome?

126
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,380
action show and this is a this is a

127
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,220
this is a charge that has been lobbied our way directly and

128
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,140
I

129
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:10,420
Just got off of reviewing netrunner and netrunner came with the netrunner rolling release came with the plasma 5 desktop

130
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,960
And I did have some critical things walking away from there

131
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,620
And I'll just give you a couple of things that happened to me and these are just my experiences

132
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,060
so I'm trying this on a system 76 bonobo and

133
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,280
Traditionally these have been extremely reliable Linux computers without any hardware issues

134
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,940
It's a really safe platform to test a distribution on they've seen a lot of distributions yes

135
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,820
And I had weird things just in the last couple of days for example

136
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,020
I would go click on the menu and then shut down and nothing happens

137
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,940
and then I would click on the menu again and click shut down and

138
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,260
Nothing happens, and then I would click on the menu again and click shut down and it would shut down

139
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,020
Oh, that's almost worse than it never working. Yeah, right

140
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,940
It's just very strange or there was another time where I was thinking about something

141
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,580
I wanted to try and I was just sitting here looking at the screen not even doing anything and

142
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:06,500
plasma 5 just crashed it just crashed like the desktop just crashed didn't even touch it and then I

143
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,420
Put a thumb drive in which is actually still in the machine

144
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:15,140
I put a thumb drive in and the little notification box comes up says hey you put a thumb drive in and I click open

145
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,720
And file manager the entire desktop session freezes the entire desktop freezes

146
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,540
I can still alt tab control tab over to my other virtual consoles

147
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,540
totally frozen

148
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:31,100
All right, so I restart everything and I restart relaunch get all my thing we get everything reloaded again

149
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,380
It's whatever I bounced back. It's not a big deal, but it's one after one after one like this

150
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,520
There's a lot of little things that we ran into during the testing that I walked away thinking

151
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,900
This is unpredictably unreliable to me like I can't I can't even fathom

152
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,980
What's gonna cause it to crash like I can't even wrap my head around and then just avoid that behavior and avoid it if you

153
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,780
Wanted to and this is generally the point

154
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,660
Where rotten corpse would jump in and tell me that kde 5 has not been declared stable

155
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,660
Do you want to make that point now rotten?

156
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,780
Yeah, thank you, and so very much so

157
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,540
It's something you have to understand is that there is a long-term support development platform

158
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,100
Which I just told you about the version 4.14 that's out

159
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,980
And if you're actually gonna run kitty as a daily driver

160
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:23,100
I think you might want to consider that do you agree with that rotten and isn't that your daily driver right now? It is my daily

161
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
driver and why not plasma 5

162
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,140
Because it's not stable. Well, but they haven't declared it stable. It is pretty stable in the sense of

163
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:38,320
Most people who's been testing it and with 5.4. So and also it matters what distro you're using it on because

164
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,820
The net runner is not a good example of

165
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,320
well

166
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,020
Quality in my opinion. Yeah, I mean you take issue with the managerial base and things like that, right?

167
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,540
right, I take I don't like men draw it in any way whatsoever and

168
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,380
I think that's a terrible base

169
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:59,820
But I also think that a lot of the decisions that netrunner made are nothing to talk, you know right home about

170
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:07,220
Like the fact that they have stuff pre-installed. Okay, so that takes 10 seconds to install something. That's yeah

171
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:14,180
Yeah, and actually to that point one of the things I like the most actually the fact that they had steam library

172
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:20,620
System libraries and clear all clear all whatever it was. That's actually from managerial. They inherited that from manager

173
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,540
Yeah, so okay. There's there's different weird things that

174
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,660
they did that they just decided that wouldn't really work well and

175
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,740
They even decided to rip out some of the plasma 5 stuff and go back to some for stuff which makes really no sense

176
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,140
but

177
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,700
Like if you look at kabuntu, there are a lot of people who are talking about kabuntu 1510 and using beta

178
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,700
Wnsx is one of them

179
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,140
another person in the mumble

180
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:54,100
Frequently fretsil is one of them and they've been using it for the beta for a long time and had no problems at all

181
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,500
So it doesn't matter what distro is implementing the plasma 5. So rotten. Do you think it's a little?

182
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:06,180
Inappropriate and maybe a little premature for certain distributions to be shipping the plasma 5 desktop

183
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,740
I think it used to be now. It's understandable like

184
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:16,300
5.4 is very close to being a solid release and even production ready

185
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:23,220
But you have to have the latest version of 5.4. So the latest good quality version is 5.4 point 2

186
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,100
Netrunner s 5.5 point 4.1, which is not as

187
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,140
as

188
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:34,140
Polished right because they make new releases all the time and if you don't keep up with it

189
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,500
But the odd thing is that of all distros kabuntu is keeping up with it

190
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,220
because they're they were they're currently their beta is currently 5.4 point 2 and

191
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:50,860
How much they're keeping to keep up with a PPA or whatever who knows? Yeah, but I think 5.4 is good enough

192
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,640
I think 5.5 is going to be like the first solid

193
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:02,400
Production ready everything. This is what I've been hoping about 5.5 and and Wes. I'm almost virtually positive

194
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,640
You're not a plasma desktop user. Have you experimented with it since the 5.0 releases come out?

195
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:14,040
And since then have you looked at it? Uh, yes, I have installed a preview of it when it was very new

196
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,040
I have not used it since maybe

197
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,800
5152 I don't quite remember which version it was and I like a lot of what they're doing

198
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,800
I have I do not have personal experience that with is in production ready

199
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,520
And that's you know, a lot of these what is the threshold for you before you would be willing to try it out?

200
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,960
Is it just your workflow is is good enough now or is it you've heard enough horror stories that you're not even interested

201
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,840
I think I fall in the I tolerate crashes and setbacks a little better than a lot of people

202
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,880
Yeah, I have a little more. Yeah flow in my workflows than some so that's not a huge deal to me

203
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,520
So maybe now maybe now is the perfect time for me to give it a shot

204
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:55,040
Yeah, and I so my takeaway was is I actually for a long time. It was a KDE user. I actually really

205
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,640
Really there's elements of the plasma 5 desktop

206
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,280
I like a lot and I have found different iterations of the 5 desktop to be more stable than other right?

207
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,680
yeah, and so for me I just I

208
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,460
Can't help but take a I when I start having these problems

209
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,680
I can't help but take a step back and go wow

210
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:18,080
What if I was an average user and I didn't know to expect this or I didn't know this was beta

211
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Or I didn't know how to solve this problem

212
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,520
This some of these things I run into would to me be fundamentally unsolvable problems that make them

213
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,760
Unusable and a lot of times when I get the when I get the feedback about you hate KDE. It's I

214
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,360
Think it's misinterpreted as I think there's a lot of use cases where plasma 5 doesn't make sense

215
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,240
And there's somewhere plasma 5 does make sense

216
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,040
And I just think there's a lot fewer use cases where plasma 5 makes sense than even

217
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,360
plasma 4

218
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,800
So anyways, I I it is getting there

219
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,960
I'm not but I hate I hate the idea that if we if we critique a few things we come across as anti KDE

220
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,980
That's not really my intention. You're still interested in a succeeding it absolutely developing. That's why I can

221
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:08,500
Check it out. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, no actually is an interesting issue because when

222
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,740
I'm a known fanboy and I have been for like a decade and

223
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,940
When I used KDE 4, I noticed some problems that were fixed in 5

224
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,420
So plasma 5 had all like 99% of what I hated about 4 was in 5

225
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,900
So I was like, I'm I'm excited for 5 and it helped me kind of pull back from critiquing

226
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,780
4 and saying look how this is crap. This is crap

227
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,780
You realize that it's going to be better

228
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,180
But right now just look at the different pieces what makes KDE good

229
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:46,700
So it's a weird approach like if I had done this test that I did later earlier this year if I had transitioned

230
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:51,440
Two years ago, it'd be completely different. I would have hated KDE. Hmm, but now

231
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,200
Since I had the perspective that the stuff that I hate is going to be fixed or is already fixed, you know

232
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
They're working on it, right?

233
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:06,560
Well, I like there's here's here's the biggest problem that I have with KDE 4 is that if you like people who like dark themes

234
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
Which is a lot of people now

235
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,840
I'm one of them. I have a dark theme

236
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,840
Globally associated to my KDE and I'm a big fan of that

237
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,040
but if

238
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,320
You do a KDE 4 dark theme it will destroy the look of Firefox

239
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:33,200
Yeah, it fixes it actually makes improvements on some applications like if you for example just load up file filezilla

240
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,880
Well silly is hideous by default, but KDE will fix it and make it look good, which is weird

241
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,440
but it makes it look good, but it takes Firefox and just like

242
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,920
It's Firefox and Thunderbird and makes them just completely crap that you have to stop and fix it or not use it

243
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,960
Well, that's interesting because Firefox and Thunderbird have their own theming things that you think would override that anyway

244
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,260
It's because they're based on GTK 2, right?

245
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,080
Yeah, and that's that's the fundamental problem of the UI, but if you

246
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,480
Run Thunderbird and Firefox in plasma 5 that problem is gone. They fixed it completely

247
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,760
Hmm, so that that problem that I originally go. Holy crap. This is awful

248
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,380
I'm not really pissed off about it because I know it's been fixed and I'm going to get a better version

249
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,560
Yeah, it does help when you know, they're working on it. That is very true. And actually Alan since you're here

250
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,440
I guess I kick it over to you

251
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,440
It is KDE a better

252
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:32,160
BSD citizen than gnome or has known been pretty good about when they when they build something that say requires login D

253
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:39,320
They work with well other projects to make sure that so at BSD can this year one of the gnome developers presented?

254
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:46,640
A talk at our conference. Oh, yeah, I mean how they actually have free BSD in their continuous integration system

255
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,360
Okay, so that they because the problem before was, you know KD's developers make a commit that breaks free BSD

256
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,440
six months later, they do a release on that and then eventually that shortly after that gets ported to free BSD and

257
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:07,680
Eventually a user gets it and tries it and finds a problem by then the developer that made the change

258
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,520
It's been eight months and he's moved on to something else. Yeah, for sure

259
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:18,760
So by integrating previously into their continuous iteration system, they find these bugs within 24 hours and

260
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,360
So it's helped them ensure that gnome runs properly on on free BSD

261
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,760
That's good by actually doing that and we're glad to be able to try them to help they needed to get that going and to see

262
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,960
That they actually have an interest in doing that. Yeah, for sure

263
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,200
Heaven's revenge you think you've got it figured out why people think I am anti KD take it sir. Oh

264
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:46,880
Yes, but one quick thing on the previous D usage. Yeah, that's considering free BSD uses clang is its default compiler

265
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,480
It can also use a lot of static analysis and find a bunch of crazy corner case bugs that the Linux distribution

266
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:59,000
Choose GCC is default but not fine. So it might help the stability on the BSD platform versus

267
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
Hmm that's an interesting point

268
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:09,120
Alright, so that helps definitely in the back end in the background. So is it something I've been saying?

269
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Is it the way I talk about it? What is it?

270
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:18,920
Well, we used to love on KDE, but then you know how gnome had a very rocky start. Yeah

271
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:25,760
Yeah, yeah. Yes, sir. Well, we started seeing it improve. We were trying to give it

272
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:33,400
Props and have people not be scared to try it. So we're giving a lot of positivity to warm usage

273
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,320
So that might be why people are thinking that you're being negative about KDE by ink

274
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:47,120
By encouraging the areas that need fixing and things like that. So, you know, such or at least attempt. Yeah, I actually we did some episodes

275
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:54,760
I actually we did some episodes dedicated to the issues with gnome 3 it was in fact, I remember I remember being

276
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,220
If I took it took years, in fact, it wasn't until January 5th

277
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:07,840
2014 a season 30 episode 4 of the Linux action show so it has been a while now back in the seasons

278
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,460
Yeah back to the seasons where we said gnomes getting good enough now knew like it wasn't until January 5th

279
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,640
2014 that we said

280
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,400
Now gnome is turning the corner and it's worth checking out and until then we were not of that opinion

281
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:27,520
Yep, and it's it's just there is a threshold like you were saying and I think maybe this is something worth exploring a little bit

282
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,920
You're willing to live with a few extra bugs assuming it's something I'm interested in and it's makes it worthwhile to check out and Rodden

283
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,320
It was kind of saying the same thing

284
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,880
He's willing to live with a few extra bugs if he knows they're working on it

285
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,940
And I think it is interesting that people were very critical of gnome and now there's a lot of people who that's all been

286
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:51,820
You know, it's gone now people people. Yeah base their whole work now. There's nothing to fear. It was of what it used to be

287
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,580
Yeah, yeah true true

288
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:08,800
Yeah, so what was it the real problem was your comment was you know, why is this was a scientific project was it?

289
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:15,180
Wait, what you know the VLA? Oh, oh, I that I was surprised that there you know as common

290
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,740
I was surprised that they were using KD because it was an old Red Hat installation

291
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,260
Which means it was a very old KD installation, right?

292
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,260
but the reason to use KD in that setting is

293
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,460
because your

294
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,300
Scientists are Windows users and they're coming over and I agree the same

295
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,620
I think I the reason why I use KD boy, but if you're a KD advocate

296
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:42,100
That's not the number one reason you want people using KD. I wouldn't think it's because it makes switching easier

297
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:48,540
Yeah, yeah, and and as far as deploying something for scientists to use that's the main thing. Yeah, I agree

298
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,340
I think that's why they were using it too

299
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,540
It was just a it was a throwaway comment that didn't leave a lot of room for I mean

300
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:59,220
I didn't feel like going into a five-minute explanation about it. But that was that was essentially it. I

301
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,100
Agree Kitson. You have a comment you want to make about combativeness

302
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:10,260
Yeah, I've noticed that the KDE devs for the most part like on the forums and even an IRC

303
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:17,820
Can tend to be a little bit combative about their decisions and whatnot when they do receive criticisms or suggestions?

304
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,540
Just like what you have mentioned time and time again about like the sound module and whatnot

305
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,700
And it still hasn't remained changed and it still is a problem

306
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,860
Yeah, it's kind of funny how much of a problem it is too

307
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:36,020
If you have if you have a computer that has built-in speakers and a headphone jack

308
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:41,100
HDMI out and like say maybe like a USB audio device. I understand

309
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,100
This is maybe not a super common setup

310
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:49,340
But I am describing the setup of anybody that has a laptop and hooks up a USB sound card can't be that uncommon, right?

311
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:55,580
Because most laptops have HDMI that does audio most laptops have a headphone jack and if you hook up a USB sound device

312
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,260
It's not that weird now you got three

313
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:04,140
And so what we discovered in the latest version that we detested was the way you make sure that sound goes out the right

314
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,700
sound card because in a lot of applications like mumble and Skype they just say

315
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,640
We're gonna use whatever the pulse audio default is you can't you can't specify

316
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,300
What the default sound card is you can just choose default pulse audio device?

317
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,620
So you have to mandate and pulse what your default device is system-wide

318
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,820
Okay, I can roll with that not a big deal

319
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,580
So I go I go in there and the only way to make sure that the sound is going out the right sound card is

320
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:34,500
By actually turning off all the other sound cards so instead of selecting your sound card

321
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,460
It is a process of elimination you go to the HDMI adapter you turn it off

322
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,900
You go to the built-in headphone jack you turn it off you go to the built-in speakers you turn it off

323
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:48,300
And then you go to your your USB audio device, and you choose from five different options in the drop-down

324
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:52,260
Analog stereo duplex, I don't know why it has to have all those different options

325
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,380
I don't know why it has to be a process of elimination

326
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,900
And I actually had to have so I had to have Rekai come down here and verify with his own eyes that I was doing

327
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:05,340
The right thing because the UI is so odd and so weird now is that a big deal once you learn it

328
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,540
No, but when you pick it up. It is very very strange, and I think these are legitimate points that we make all right

329
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,540
All right

330
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:19,660
Hardware you have to use is higher-end using different connections

331
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:26,080
You're gonna have you're gonna deal with stuff like that, but if you're like a regular consumer user who has a USB headset for example

332
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,200
We'll not have a problem with that because the USB headset will show up in mumble

333
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,600
But they still have to you would actually still have to go into the settings and

334
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,880
That's pulse pulses set that as your default sound device you got you got lucky

335
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,840
I mean you got lucky maybe because my my USB audio device didn't get set as the default audio device

336
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
I'm not using

337
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,880
Anyways I

338
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,880
I felt like I feel like I guess the core point is I feel like every time we try to say these things need to

339
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,080
Be improved we get we get a lot of criticism for hating something

340
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,640
I don't know why we have to hate just to be able to criticize

341
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,440
Criticism does not equal hate criticism equals caring enough about something to say hey this could be improved upon

342
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:22,440
I don't know like it's it kind of goes back to the episode from last week of the conversation of if there's a technical problem

343
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,560
It's okay to perform up to point it out. Yeah, pretty much what you were doing right? Yeah

344
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:34,120
Yeah, in fact speaking of technical stuff that first of all the plasma desktop is filled with awesome technical stuff

345
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,400
But there is a really cool piece of software

346
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,880
That rotten corpse actually had a chance to do a write-up on called Katie connect

347
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,120
And you can sync your Android device with your Linux computer, and this is really really nice in fact

348
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,080
You don't even really have to be a KD desktop user take advantage of it

349
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,760
But this is an example of some really cool technology so before we get into that

350
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,360
I'm going to tell you about our friends over at ting my mobile service provider

351
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:05,440
Linux dot ting dot-com the internet service provider of the JB rover as well ting is pay for what you use mobile service

352
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,080
How cool is that it's a flat six dollars for the line, and then you just pay for what you use

353
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,840
I'm not even joking that's seriously how it's structured. It's six dollars for the line

354
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,400
Cellphone my fi ting don't care their honey badger about it

355
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,240
It's just six dollars and your usage your minutes your messages your megabytes

356
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:28,740
No BS charges no extra stuff. No early termination like charges because there's no contract

357
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,840
Nothing like that in fact not only is there no contract, but they have an early termination relief program

358
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,120
I love it. They have an aggressively awesome customer service department

359
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,080
I'd love for you to try them out at one eight five five ting FTW

360
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,960
They have fantastic online communities and because ting is so cool

361
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,600
And they're kind of changing things up a little bit

362
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,520
There are some uber passionate community members that definitely want to help you out is really really cool

363
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,920
What I love about ting is that I'm able to go at it with a little bit of intelligence a little bit of flexibility

364
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,320
So I know that I have X amount of devices. I want to put them all on one plan

365
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,960
I don't want to have to sit here and nickel and dime myself either

366
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,360
I want to have up three or four devices, and I just want to pay a pool of minutes across them for whatever they use

367
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,280
So if I got a couple of phones

368
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,960
I don't use very much or a mi-fi device that I don't use very much

369
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,600
I only pay for the device that is actually using the service and here's another thing. I love about ting

370
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,880
GSM service and CDMA service bumsies

371
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,680
So that way you got a compatible device almost guaranteed in your house because guess what cell phones have been around for a while

372
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,760
You bring it over to ting and when you go to Linux dot ting comm you're gonna get the discount off a phone

373
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,160
But if you got a phone that's working on these GSM or CDMA networks, and you probably do

374
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,080
$25 service credit that paid for more than my first month of ting here's another nice thing about ting

375
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:44,680
Excellent excellent dashboard really good. It really solves all the problems

376
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,920
I have been a ting customer for over two years

377
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,640
And I've had to call them for a grand total of twice and the first time I called them

378
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,020
I was like yeah, might as well just call them and see what it's like second time

379
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,260
I called them it was totally legit and man

380
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,920
They were like a dog with a bone when it came to my problem. They I

381
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,440
Honestly, it was 20 minutes into the issue

382
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,680
And I thought for sure the customer service rep was gonna start wrapping me up and apologizing and just letting me go man

383
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,160
She stuck with the issue like it was super impressive

384
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:19,200
It felt really good because I could tell that my time was valuable to ting. I love their dashboard

385
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,160
I love their customer service Linux dot ting comm I want you to check them out six dollars a month for your phone and yes

386
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:31,800
You can go pick up the Nexus 5x and the Nexus 6p and bring them over to ting

387
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,960
That's right

388
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,520
You can officially bring the Nexus 5 or Nexus pay to ting

389
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,680
Powerful well price you can get the Google edition if you're gonna get yourself a Google phone

390
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,400
You can check it out ting is gonna be doing an unboxing very soon, but here's the power user tip

391
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,440
Just go get a SIM card. We got GSM and CDMA SIM cards for nine dollars

392
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,520
And when you go to linux.ting.com you get a $25 discount if you have a device that needs to do

393
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,760
Updating over text messages check in for stats

394
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,600
Update any kind of remote information like a I mean for example my buddy chase. I thought was

395
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,600
Brilliant about this he went and got one of these home security systems that just

396
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,960
Transmits an image when it detects motion and and and a condition has been triggered very nice

397
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:19,680
And when that happens it just sends him an image over the ting CDMA network just sends it to him

398
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,600
I think he's using GSM

399
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,680
And I just get he gets the push notification on his phone and he can bring it up and then if he wants to he can

400
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,840
Initiate a real-time stream now when chase was first looking at building that he's like well

401
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,040
I could go get a $30 $40 and $60 a month different

402
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:38,200
These are like my different plan options, or I can go to ting six dollars a month pay for what I use Noah

403
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:43,560
Buys like a batch of these GSM SIM cards and then as he gets the devices he pops them in there and boom he's got

404
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,520
Ting service on it now. That's really cool. It is really really cool

405
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,200
You can go to linux.ting.com to get our discount and also go check out their blog to find out details about the new Nexus devices

406
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
with that USB C connector

407
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,320
You know what I like about the 5x and the 6p Nexus devices not only are they Google edition devices?

408
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,240
But they have GSM and CDMA antennas in them

409
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,240
And if you combine that I mean just think about this for a second so you can be on ting you pay for what you?

410
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,680
Use you getting all the devices are unlocked, so it's like you really own the device

411
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,040
And then with like the Nexus line of devices you can pick between

412
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,840
CDMA and GSM depending on what you need where you're going all that stuff

413
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:28,880
That is awesome really slick really really slick linux.ting.com to support the show and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring the Linux

414
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
Unplugged program that is very awesome

415
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
All right, Mr.. Rotten corpse

416
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:39,960
Now tell me about Kde connect because it promises to sync my Android device with my linux desktop

417
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,760
And I'm thinking to myself man wouldn't this be nice to finally if I mark something is red somewhere

418
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,880
It's marked as red on both devices if I get a notification

419
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:53,360
or maybe if I just want to check basic connectivity and so this kind of sounds like it's right up my alley and

420
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:59,200
When you from what you were telling me on the pre show I don't necessarily even have to be a Kde user do I?

421
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,360
Nope, you don't there's a app indicator, and there's also a shell extension for

422
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:10,440
For gnome to use the app indicator or to use this Kde connect daemon

423
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,960
Not all of the features are available to like

424
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:21,560
There's actually only one problem if you're not a Kde user and that is you can't send the connection from the phone to

425
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:29,000
accept on the computer because the Kde notifications are the only ones that have that functionality built in okay

426
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,960
It will display, but the functionality doesn't work any other de's all right you send the connection from the applet, and it's fine

427
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,640
But the reason why Kde connect is awesome is not like a lot of people look at it is it notification system and

428
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,200
Originally, that's what it was, but there's it's beyond that ridiculous now

429
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,960
You can you sync it notifications. Yes, that's cool, but it has

430
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:59,720
a wireless mounting of your Android device to your phone wow oh, that's cool. Yeah, it has

431
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:08,280
Multi-device clipboard synchronization, so yeah, so you have used you copy something on your desktop it will

432
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:15,700
Then copy it to your phone and then Kde connect will handle it sending it to every other device that is currently connected at that time

433
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:21,840
And I've tested it through like five different computers, and it all syncs immediately, and there's no lag whatsoever

434
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:28,520
You just move to the next when it's there. That's cool. That is really slick then it also has a remote input controls, which

435
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,840
Ridiculously awesome, and I don't you know I never thought I would do it until I trusted on a tablet

436
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:40,060
It's amazing you basically turn your tablet into a touchpad. Oh like a mouse

437
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:40,880
Yeah

438
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:46,040
You have a mouse so you have a remote mouse that you can use and you can also have do keyboard your kit your Android

439
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,120
Keyboard can be your keyboard for your computer

440
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,940
Yeah, I know Chris Moore to do PCB SD or

441
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,920
BSD now with uses his Android cell phone to control his media center really pause and play and scrub through videos

442
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,840
Yeah, and this is another cool thing about that is that you it'll work it doesn't work for every player

443
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,840
but it works for like VLC and

444
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,760
Clementine and a lot of applications work, so the ones I use

445
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,880
Yeah, pretty much, so it works with the only guy the only two player

446
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,720
I couldn't find I could find that would not work was mpv, and that's just because they haven't built the functionality in but

447
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,680
There's there's another cool thing about the media player is

448
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,220
It is not only you know controlling media from

449
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:38,200
Your phone to your computer it also allows you to get to use your your computer your phone as a reference to when to

450
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,560
Lower the volume or mute it so if you get a phone call it will mute your music on your computer

451
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:49,040
So that is like yeah, and then as soon as you hang up the phone call the music is back up Wow

452
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,780
Okay, that almost tells me on it right there. I

453
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,200
Mean the VLC thing so I have been using I can't remember it. Oh shoot uh

454
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,600
Rekha I might know if he's if he's watching live, but I've been using a Linux an Android app. Oh

455
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:10,000
Unified remote unified remote I've been using unified remote for a while to essentially accomplish a tiny

456
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,080
Fraction of what you're talking about unified remote it has a little daemon that you install on your Linux box

457
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:23,900
That makes your your your remote touch device act like a keyboard input device or a mouse and you can control VLC and stuff like

458
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:29,940
That but you don't get like the pausing and the muting I mean that is genuinely slick the level of integration here seems

459
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,720
Yeah, almost unbelievable. It's more than that too

460
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,060
You also can like make it where it'll display your battery percentage of your phone on your computer

461
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,920
That's nice. You can easily switch, and that's just that's not a little nicety, but there's

462
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,100
Other things you can send files back and forth from the phone to the computer

463
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,360
So if you send a file from your phone, it will go with your downloads folder in your computer

464
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
And it like it does

465
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,760
This is not even everything I've mentioned like there's not everything I've mentioned is not all what it does

466
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,520
What is it using on the back end is it using like to transfer the files is it using SSHFS is it using yes?

467
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:09,000
Uh-huh does the file so does the phone and the app on the phone have like a login to your computer. How does that work?

468
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,560
Yeah, you you essentially you

469
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,200
use SSH to share keys between the devices so that your

470
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:21,320
Like it will remember your devices and what like your names and things like that based on the SSH key, okay?

471
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,980
That is nice. I love that. It's doing over SSH and does that

472
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,880
How possible is it to do some of this stuff?

473
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:33,000
Outside your LAN like say if you have a port forwarding setup right now

474
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,560
It's not technically well actually over your LAN if you have if you go through the process of port forwarding you could probably you can

475
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,160
Make it work or you probably need a dynamic DNS or something like yeah, yeah

476
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:49,120
But if you but another cool thing is that they're working on currently like the next release are two features that are coming

477
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
That are even more awesome

478
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:57,600
That makes this is actually one of the KDE Connect is one of the tools that makes me love KDE project

479
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,740
Because of like all the amazing stuff. They're building for it

480
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,600
and then two things that are coming now is replying to SMS from your yeah Wow and

481
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,680
Bluetooth support so instead of Wi-Fi. It's Bluetooth that handles the yeah

482
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,520
I agree with heavens this stuff kind of thing is much better over the LAN the only thing is is

483
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:23,000
When I'm out and about and I know this is stupid, but they keep putting better and better cameras and mobile phones

484
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,440
And so I can't help but use it for stuff, and then I'm like okay now

485
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,360
I want to immediately send that back to the studio

486
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,360
Yeah, so that could be really cool, so

487
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,040
Now I don't not to jump a hot not to jump ahead

488
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:37,680
But I kind of wanted to have a caveat in here for the mint users because apparently you ran into some issues there

489
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,680
Yeah, I did so I like the mean

490
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,320
Yeah, mint does the I don't know why they do this

491
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:51,680
I I kind of get it, but it's also doesn't make sense because it's just based on the hierarchy of where you put the new source

492
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,280
It's that's all you need to do, but for some reason the mint team decided to put the priority of

493
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,400
Their packages on their repos higher than Ubuntu

494
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:09,720
But the PPAs del fault lower than the proprietary that mint does so if you put your PPA on

495
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,960
Top of the list on Ubuntu it uses that PPA

496
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:19,120
But because they're both 500 level priority, but mint for some reason does a 700 priority

497
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,400
So even if you install that PPA. It's going to completely ignore it

498
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,800
So you have to change the policy of mint on your computer, or you have to install with a deb file

499
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,040
So I assume if I install this on my pretty much known pure system

500
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,320
There's going to be a quite a bit of dependencies that it's going to pull down

501
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:41,960
Yeah, it'll it will have been it will bring in some KD libraries like I've had there was a people a couple people ask me

502
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:49,720
Questions on the article and in reddit like what they were confused by because a lot of people consider like the KD dependency is

503
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,080
Like a horrible thing

504
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:56,000
But it brings in packages, and if you're long as you're you know not in 1998

505
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,480
You don't really have to care about the size

506
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,240
That's true

507
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,640
And then the honest the honest truth is is a lot of times with the QT stuff once you pull it in once pretty much

508
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,840
They're going forward all the other QT apps you need are gonna rely you just shocked that first time yeah exactly like well

509
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,160
You know and I pretty much got over that the first time. It's old quazzle. Yep exactly

510
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,600
It's not the disk space so much though because with with the KD connect stuff. It requires the KD base

511
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,680
Yeah, so you've got a quiet bit more. That's running in the background

512
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,880
Okay, it's not it's not like it's running

513
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,160
It's not running QT in the background for anything

514
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,840
And it's not running like plasma or anything like that you're pulling those packages in right you're pulling in the KD base packages

515
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,840
Which is quite a bit of stuff?

516
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,680
But yeah, I agree. It's probably in most the times not all that of avoid

517
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,560
I mean, it's not it's not all avoidable because there's a lot of apps that require that

518
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,560
I mean even on a gnome system. There's a lot of apps that you end up still pulling that down, so yeah

519
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,680
That's not it's not it's not a big deal

520
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,960
It used to be a big deal

521
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,520
But now that it's kind of like one of those legacy issues that people complain about ten years ago

522
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,820
That was relevant then that isn't now, but people still complain about I bet you though

523
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:11,560
I bet wimpy's to wimpy's point. I bet you it's enough that it won't ship by default in any non KD distros

524
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,640
Right this is gonna be this is gonna be a bit of a leg up

525
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:21,320
This is a nice advantage this KD connect is really nice. I know it once I hope it works

526
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,300
I'm excited to try it when I go home well and and Wes I kind of you know when you when I think about

527
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:31,120
Convergence this to me feels a little more like a lot my speed like it's a you know

528
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,460
I'm being able to send files back and forth using SHFS the notifications things like that

529
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,460
It's a little more like I'm I'm

530
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,480
What I like about this is two things number one is it gets sort of two devices

531
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:49,380
They're weren't really communicating before but doing a lot of the same jobs talking you love that number two is it's essentially Apple's

532
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,300
Handjob, I mean handoff or whatever they call it

533
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:59,040
But but for Apple you have to have a really new Mac that has bluetooth 4o le and you have to have it like at least

534
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,800
An iPhone 5 or something or better for any of this stuff to work and here Linux comes along

535
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,600
It's like oh, yeah, you got Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and Android and KDE or KD dependencies. You're good to go

536
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,800
No special hardware required. I also like that it lets you kind of separate things

537
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,000
Maybe you like different programs on your phone versus you know or different different workload styles on your phone versus your full-size computer

538
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,680
Yeah, so here you can just share the data without right sharing the app

539
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,280
so also to point out another important thing about KD connect is it

540
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,840
Pertains to the you know, they actually adopt the whole

541
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:38,040
Customization thing as well in KD connect so every plug-in that is available to KD connect can be turned off on any device that you

542
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,040
Want it to be?

543
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,680
So for some reason if you don't like the clipboard synchronization you can turn it off and

544
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:50,480
so what's the what's the advantage over something like this so versus like say push bullet or

545
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
air droid

546
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,040
They like well push build only does the like well air droid

547
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,920
I hate air droid like there's a lot of people who talk about air droids business great

548
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,940
But you have to activate the login connection every single time you use it like awful

549
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:13,320
Anyway, well this one KD connect stores the connections and they work consistently regardless

550
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:20,760
I have never had a connection drop. Oh really like even with Wi-Fi mounting of the file system. I never have a problem

551
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:27,560
I don't have to worry about losing access while I'm moving files over or anything. It it's I've never had a problem and

552
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,080
It allows me to control every aspect to it and it has features that push bullet for example only has like

553
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,400
Notification in a file connection it push bullet does have SMS

554
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,760
Response, but that's coming soon and KD connect and but another good thing is

555
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:53,480
None of those are open source. Oh, that's exactly that's a good point, so I had boy. It's been

556
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:01,280
Holy crap. Oh my god. It's been a year almost and it's been a year and about a week about a year and a week ago

557
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:07,280
I met the developer of KD connect when he first started working on this and he I'm gonna get it wrong

558
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,140
But I can't remember what country he moved from let's just say let's just pretend like it's Germany

559
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,000
But he just moved to country a yeah

560
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,800
But what what actually matters is he had just moved to Seattle hey?

561
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:23,300
Yeah, so he was in Seattle, and I went to a KD users group because I hate KD so much

562
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:27,880
I go to KD users group, and I was right on everyone. Yeah, right. Yeah, just cuz I could

563
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,880
Yeah, that's what I do when I go to KD users groups

564
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,920
And I went down there and I talked to him and I told him like how awesome it is and talked to him

565
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,620
Also, there's some other there was designers there and things like that and I was asking him where where it was going next and he's

566
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:48,160
Like well, you know just gonna keep working on it, and so here. We are a year later, and it is slick

567
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,160
Yeah, it is really slick

568
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,680
Very nice run and they need to work on their marketing more because they they don't that's one of the reasons

569
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,080
I wanted to write an article about it is because it is

570
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,840
When I never used it because I didn't use Katie then I used

571
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:08,680
Wow this this is this would make me want to use Katie, but because I don't have to use Katie

572
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:13,080
It makes it even better and another thing is it doesn't require Android

573
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,080
It also works on BlackBerry oh

574
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,720
They're working on iOS version as well what

575
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,480
What?

576
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:25,480
No, that one's that'll no way no way how can that even work?

577
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,520
iOS

578
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,800
Does iOS support networking? I don't think I was

579
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,040
They probably have absolutely everything yeah, it'll still it'll still give something that

580
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,720
You know at least it doesn't leave them out completely or anything

581
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:45,520
But there is there is one thing that should be mentioned that as as far as a versioning caveat mm-hmm

582
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,560
You need

583
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:54,040
0.7 point three or higher to use the cleat keyboard remote keyboard feature

584
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,560
That's pretty much it everything else works

585
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,440
With that regardless of the version okay, but so like the 1404 and stuff based on that has

586
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:09,960
0 7 3 or 0 7 1 so you would need to add a PPA to get the functionality for that

587
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,960
But everything else works great

588
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:18,040
Yeah, yeah alright, so this is something. I'm gonna play with I think I you know after looking at a while ago

589
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,800
I think I definitely have to check it out again, and you can too mr.

590
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,640
Rotten corpse has a write-up at make use of calm

591
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,080
We'll have a link to that in the show notes where he goes through all of this

592
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,720
Which is very handy, so I have a link to that. Thank you rotten corpse

593
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:36,040
I am my appetite has been whetted as they say is that what they say I believe so

594
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,360
I think that's that's the right next week. We'll have tried it and we'll be better synchronized

595
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,720
So just wait for that

596
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,800
I think so

597
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,480
Whimpy I know you're still around don't go anywhere

598
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,280
I got a question for you about your connectivity and the key point to that connectivity your router

599
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,920
But before we get to that I want to thank our next sponsor, and that's the great folks over at

600
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:04,120
Digital ocean check out digital ocean comm a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

601
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,880
For you to spin up your own cloud server. That's what they say I say a

602
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:13,080
Really fast Linux rig that's how I would say it spin up your own fast Linux rig up in the cloud one that is

603
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:17,080
Damn, fast is connected to the super fast SSDs a great connection

604
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,800
And it's sitting in a rockin data center

605
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,040
And you can start in less than 55 seconds and pricing plans start at only five dollars a month

606
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:29,160
Five dollars a month to get your 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer

607
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,960
But if you use the promo code now get ready for this because it's completely brilliant

608
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:40,760
Do unplugged do unplug no way one word lowercase you put that thing into the digital ocean thingy there

609
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,640
And it's like some sort of magic. It's like I'm gonna do so much

610
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,520
You know what it's like Donald Trump walks up to you, and he says you know what first of all

611
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,360
I do wine because I want to win and here's ten dollars

612
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:54,520
It's like Donald Trump gives you ten dollars for digital ocean boom you put it in your digital ocean droplet

613
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:59,360
You could try it out for two months for free when you do the $5 rig now digital ocean has data center locations in New York

614
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,620
San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam London, Germany

615
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,840
a

616
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,680
Brand new one in Toronto

617
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,080
Yeah, when you want to avoid the NSA. That's where you go. I digital ocean didn't write that

618
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,920
I'm just saying if you want to have your day

619
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,960
I'm Chris's man if you want to have your day in the North America region

620
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,560
And you don't want the NSA reading all of it you could go check out through the Toronto data center

621
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,520
Hashtag just saying now also their interface

622
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:27,240
Let's talk about that holy moly if I can legally get married to an interface that would be the one I tell you what I?

623
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:33,800
Would go into the courthouse. I would say I'm going to marry digital oceans interface for the rest of my life. I will

624
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,080
Appreciate that and I would then go home

625
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,940
I would consummate that marriage with digital

626
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:44,080
Interface that part I will not be there for but here's what I'll do West cuz you know

627
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:50,960
I'm real slick as I'm gonna use their API because they have a straightforward API and let me tell you something if you want to scale

628
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,760
Up the API is the way to go you want to go deploy on-demand

629
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,720
Maybe you want to scale your infrastructure because I got hourly pricing. Did you know they have hourly pricing?

630
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,860
It's true. They got hourly pricing and you plug into something like chef or puppet

631
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:05,380
Just scale up on-demand or whatever you want. I'm not gonna judge tons of code out there

632
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:09,560
You can already take advantage of digital ocean takes these platform features seriously

633
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,260
Here's a few ten poles of digital ocean that I like a lot all based on Linux

634
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:18,860
Yeah, that rocks KVM for the backend virtualization what you've got SSDs throughout tier one data connections

635
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,120
great interface and last but not least

636
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:29,400
Really good community documentation tutorials that they've paid for they've hired full-time editors to make sure that they rock

637
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:35,040
I mean really good stuff that makes taking advantage of digital ocean droplet really straightforward

638
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,880
So you get it deployed you use the one-click application to get your basic stack up

639
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,240
Maybe you want to also throw ghosts on top of that or get lab or whatever it is

640
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,480
And then you're like well geez this $5 rig. It's still got a ton of horsepower left

641
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,200
I should use it for something else trust me

642
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:52,920
This is gonna cross your mind because you're gonna be blown away with how powerful these things are so then you go to the community

643
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:58,640
Section that's really where they take it up a notch go over to digital ocean comm remember that promo code do unplugged and take a

644
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,380
Look at the community section three ways to securely browse the internet with an open VPN on

645
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:11,860
Debian 8 now that is a handy handy tutorial for digital ocean imagine turning your do droplet into an open VPN server I

646
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:18,220
Love that how to mitigate a denial of service attack against your website with cloudflare. Let's go look at like that one

647
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,500
That's got to be fairly interesting

648
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:25,620
I would imagine because I'm not a huge cloudflare fan, but you know what I've never really had an opportunity to integrate it properly

649
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:29,460
I love this kind of stuff so many good apps so many good

650
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:33,820
Documentation so many so much good tutorials all this stuff is available for free

651
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:37,380
And I'm gonna be honest some of it's not even specific to digital

652
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:41,100
You could go use that stuff regardless a reference

653
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,580
Yeah, exactly and you know what then when you are ready to use digital ocean

654
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:49,800
Just use that promo code do unplugged get the $5 credit for two months try it out absolutely free no credit card required

655
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:54,600
It's insanely great digital ocean comm promo code do unplugged also

656
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,940
You could probably get paid for doing a write-up

657
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:02,200
They pay anywhere between a hundred to two hundred dollars for technical tutorials potential writers can submit a writing sample to become a tutorial writer

658
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:08,480
Just find out more by going digital oceans community website digital ocean comm slash community slash get dash paid dash to dash right

659
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,580
they have

660
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:15,280
Positions available right now you go do that you write a few tutorials a month you could live out of an RV

661
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:20,260
Digital ocean comm use the promo code do unplugged and a real big

662
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:28,100
Thank you digital ocean for sponsoring Linux unplug guys go check it out is a really cool system if you were gonna build a hosting

663
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:33,100
System around Linux. This is what you'd make you know and that that KVM part cannot be oversold

664
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:39,460
I've been fighting with a provider on a less than capable virtualization platform recently that I'd already paid for and yes

665
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:43,140
I'm quite inspired right yes, and trying to get some IP tables modules loaded

666
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:47,700
You don't need that on digital ocean you know KVM. You've got full control. That's right. Load them yourself

667
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:54,300
That's right digital ocean comm use the promo code do unplugged and a big thanks to digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program

668
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:58,700
You guys are rocking it. I love seeing that so I want to talk about

669
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:04,900
Something that's more than just an open source router. It's an open source center of your home a home router

670
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,140
They say is necessary to connect you to the internet

671
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:13,100
But that's just sitting there idle most the time when you're not using internet eating electricity and boy have I noticed that recently

672
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,340
So why not use your home router to do more things?

673
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:19,660
More powerful hardware can handle gigabit traffic

674
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:24,740
maybe could act as a home NAS a print server, maybe even a

675
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:32,220
Virtual server now before I get into how crazy this is I wanted to bring in wimpy because I

676
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:38,180
Know that if I recall wimpy has some sort of eccentric setup

677
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,700
But it involves like antennae wave

678
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:47,740
Transmissions and all kinds of stuff and wimpy if you could remind me about your setup, and how do you actually bring that into your house?

679
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,700
Like what is the router you're using and all of that stuff?

680
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:55,220
I'm really curious because I'm looking at different solutions to bring internet connectivity into the rover

681
00:52:55,220 --> 00:53:01,260
And I keep hitting up against once you have like an antenna you have to bring that into something and that seems to be

682
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,380
Where things fall apart?

683
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:14,260
Okay, well, I'm speaking to you now over the power of shortwave radio broad band. I love it. You sound good wimpy. You do sound good. You always sound good.

684
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,740
Yeah

685
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:17,620
so yeah

686
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,420
my

687
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:24,460
Backhaul is about four miles from here over the other side of the trees

688
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:31,580
So there's um it's a microtech. You know no one has spoken about these in the past

689
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:38,300
So running up the side of the house. Okay. There's an aerial with a directional microtech

690
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:43,420
Radio which is the the piece that actually does the connection between?

691
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,540
the house and the backhaul

692
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,300
That's capable of sustaining a hundred megabits

693
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:56,800
But I'm only paying for 12. Oh, so I have a 12 12 megabit connection 12

694
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:02,080
12 down 4 up. Do you mind like roughly giving me an idea of what that costs you?

695
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:09,280
That costs about 45 pounds a month. Okay, that's not bad $60. Yeah, I'm like that seems pretty reasonable

696
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,800
Well, I mean for 12, and that's unmetered us. Okay, that's on me. Okay, I'll take it

697
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:18,720
And and I know it's unmetered because one month I kind of got carried away with my radar analysis

698
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,960
And I pulled one and a half terabytes across the the network. That's an excellent test

699
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:28,000
Yeah, they contacted me to say have you got a virus, but they weren't at all bothered

700
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,640
It's not malware

701
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:39,080
So the the aerial and the radio that's connected via power over ethernet

702
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,580
So the cable comes down the side of the house through a you know, a small hole in the wall

703
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,800
runs along the back of the skirting board behind me here and

704
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,640
into a little

705
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,960
adapter and POE

706
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,240
converter

707
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,160
nice and

708
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,160
That's plugged into a UPS

709
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,500
So if the power in the house goes down

710
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:06,040
The internet doesn't nice and then also plugged into the same UPS

711
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:13,620
I did used to have a micro tech router doing you know, the home LAN and Wi-Fi, but I've now got a TP link

712
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,580
router okay that I flashed

713
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,300
gargoyle router onto which is a

714
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,980
open

715
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:23,420
wrt

716
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,420
derivative and in my opinion is the best of the

717
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,520
Open-source router project really and you know

718
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,700
What's interesting is the TP link seem to be very very popular for this particular type of activity

719
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,540
Gargoyle

720
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,820
Gargoyle dash router comms that sound right? That's that's the one

721
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:43,740
Yeah, and the model that I've got I flashed myself

722
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:48,540
But they have a number of models that you can actually buy from them pre flashed

723
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,540
So if you're at all

724
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:57,260
Concerned about being a warranty voider, they will they'll do the hard work for you and send you one pre-configured

725
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:03,760
Interesting. I have not heard of gargoyle before maybe because this is I've a lot of a lot of people that are looking at the

726
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,760
TP links are still doing

727
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:07,500
ddr

728
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,340
ddwrt and

729
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:11,900
Yeah, those but I don't think they're getting updated as much anymore

730
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:18,020
These are this is really good. This gets an update. Well, whenever there's a security exploit this gets an update

731
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:22,420
Really? It's under active development. I'm actually a version behind at the moment

732
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:27,420
There's a new stable release out that I need to update to. Rodden have you heard of this before?

733
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:34,340
Yeah, I could be wrong, but I think it's a fork of either openwrt or ddwrt. It's openwrt

734
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:39,340
Yeah, it's openwrt with a really nice UI UI on top

735
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:39,840
Okay

736
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:46,220
And the reason I found this is because I wanted to put new routers into my family

737
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:51,820
My extended family's houses after those big netgear exploits a couple of years ago, right?

738
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:55,940
So I bought cheap TP link routers for like 20 quid a go

739
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:02,980
Put gargoyle on the on it and pre-configured them and then sent them all out to everyone's houses. I

740
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:07,980
Like this because the UI on this is really easy to use. Yeah, it's not

741
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,380
Honestly, this seems like a great

742
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:16,140
Christmas gift idea for my family to do a few of these for like my mother have a good setup

743
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:22,380
Yeah, be confident that it'll last it won't degrade and and and and and what I did is, you know

744
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:27,420
I set up the second wireless LAN. Yeah to be common for everybody

745
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:33,260
Ah, so when we all move between each other's houses, we could all get on each other's guest LAN. Oh

746
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:39,740
That's looking ahead that is thinking so when you go over to visit you get on their Wi-Fi

747
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:45,540
Yeah, and everyone else now because I only have to set their phones up once it doesn't matter where they go

748
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:50,940
They get on the Wi-Fi and there's an analyst. Oh Martin. Can you just configure, you know eight phones?

749
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,380
Right. Yes, you know, what's funny is

750
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:59,220
Years and years and years ago. In fact, there's a YouTube video about this. I

751
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:02,180
bought a bunch of Wi-Fi routers for my family and

752
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:06,940
Because I wanted to get them all digital picture frames to show the pictures of our newborn son

753
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,380
And I thought here you go Kodak has a good deal

754
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:14,000
I got I got like four or five digital picture frames, but they all required wireless internet connectivity

755
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,500
Of course, there's a long enough ago now, but six before that was coming six years ago

756
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,100
It just wasn't all that common that they had Wi-Fi

757
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:26,260
And so I bought them the linksys models that you could replace the firmware on and did that and now they all sit there

758
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:29,660
And some of my I still come over six years later like Oh Christopher

759
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:33,620
We just want to thank you for that Wi-Fi router now that we have our new tablets

760
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:39,700
It is so nice to get online and check the Facebook to see the pictures of the grandchildren relative said charming

761
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:45,060
Yeah, they are quite charming and and I didn't even think about like I it hasn't even crossed my mind

762
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:47,520
What I'm gonna do to replace their particular setup, but wimpy

763
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:53,420
This is this is brilliant and you find the software is powerful enough for you as a as a Linux power user quote-unquote

764
00:58:53,980 --> 00:59:01,340
Yeah, so I originally used this, you know for my family for a low-tech solution. Yeah, actually I found it

765
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,940
So nice. I use it for yourself myself

766
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,340
seal of approval

767
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:14,100
And so you have your wireless wave whatever it is broadband shortwave whatever magic

768
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:21,860
Radio broadband coming into this and it just acts like a WAN port. I assume. Yeah, it just looks like an Ethernet one port to this

769
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,860
router and

770
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:26,020
Yeah, you just configure a PPO

771
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,220
It seems like to me the biggest

772
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:35,420
Challenge with this is you got to get you got to get in the right groove at the right time when it comes to hardware

773
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:38,420
So you've landed on these TP TP link routers

774
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:44,700
which work pretty well and it seemed to be pretty popular amongst people that are equipping their RVs that I've been doing research for

775
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,780
different internet options and

776
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:50,800
The problem I have with that is that's a pretty solid recommendation for a year

777
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:56,420
But it's not like from a year from now like somebody that's listening to episode 114 in a year from now

778
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:00,380
We could say go get TP link model blah blah blah blah and maybe you know

779
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:03,140
It is do you know what it is off the top of your head the TP link model that you're using?

780
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:08,020
Yeah, mine's it's still being sold. It's a TL WR 10 0 4 3 N

781
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:12,260
Mine's about I've had mine for about a good while

782
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:17,500
now over two years don't you find though that the kind of the biggest challenge here is that

783
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:22,720
In a year from now that won't necessarily be the right router to recommend to people

784
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:29,020
Like this is the issue I have with the custom firmware's is that you can say you can you can give a recommendation today

785
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:31,980
but it doesn't necessarily mean that

786
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:35,600
Like in a six months or even three months from now. It's the right one

787
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:43,140
Well when when I did this there was two models that I used the model that I've got and a smaller model both of which

788
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:48,440
Are still available are still either 20 or 30 pounds depending on which model you get

789
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:53,700
The the revision of the board has changed. It's like a v1 v2 v3

790
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:57,740
But they're all supported by this and they've got

791
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:03,820
When you download the firmware, you know from this website, it says, you know, this is for the fee one boards

792
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:07,380
This is for the v2. Okay, and so on. Okay, so they're sitting on top of the model

793
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:11,680
The model I'm using is the model that the company still sells pre-flashed

794
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:14,220
also, the

795
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:17,380
TP link is not just replacing

796
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:21,980
like functionality stuff there they're creating new versions of the same model so like

797
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:26,600
Yeah compatibility still exists like my the router I have I

798
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:31,440
Bought I went to buy another one of that, but they made a new version of it

799
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,120
So it's still compatible with gargoyle. That's cool

800
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:40,880
You can you can even though they're making new versions of their hardware. It's pretty pretty much still compatible

801
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:47,200
Anyway, so let me introduce to you the tourist omnia, which is trying to solve this particular problem

802
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,280
They say it's more than just a router. It's an open source center of your home

803
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:54,640
I don't know if that's necessarily true or not, but it's open or something you want, right?

804
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,280
It's open heart feature open hardware running

805
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:06,000
In OS based on open wrt. It has a dual core arm processor running at 1.6. Gigahertz

806
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,040
they say with PC like performance in here and

807
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:14,360
It has so here's one point six one point six gigahertz dual core arm CPU

808
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,840
Honestly, that does sound fast enough to be a router up to a gigabyte of RAM four gigabytes of flash

809
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,240
five

810
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,340
gigabit ports for the LAN

811
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:28,180
One gigabit port for the WAN it supports USB 3.0

812
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:33,700
It has two mini PCI Express one M SATA connector. It has three

813
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:40,140
MIMO 8 or 211 AC ports and two 8 or 211 BGN ports

814
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:43,660
starting at a hundred USD for this thing and

815
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:47,540
I'm looking I'm showing them live on the video version here a

816
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:54,700
little schematics of it has it has M SATA like I mentioned mini PCI USB 3 and processor a Marvell processor and

817
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,500
and a

818
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:02,660
Sim card slot for backup internet connectivity how cool is this little thing of this?

819
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:05,560
I don't I don't know if this is actually practical or not

820
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:09,640
But and I don't think of this could replace the TP links today wimpy

821
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,260
But I look at this and I think maybe a year from now something like this might be

822
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:19,260
The direction we're pointing people for something like gargoyle then a TP link. What do you think?

823
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,880
Do you think something like this ARM based could be the solution?

824
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,540
What is your hardware right now? And when you look at this does it sound like reasonable a reasonable option?

825
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:31,680
Okay, so the box that I've got now the the router I was just describing

826
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:31,980
Yeah

827
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:38,180
And it's a few years old that's got five gigabit ethernet ports one one for the WAN and four for the LAN

828
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,900
And I just take one of those

829
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:45,580
Gigabit LAN ports into a switch and then yeah

830
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,980
Gigabit that makes switch. Yeah, that makes sense

831
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:55,700
So then you know you minimize how much of your local traffic is actually, you know routing up. Yes to the to the router

832
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,700
I would probably do it that way too. And

833
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:01,580
Then I've got two HP micro servers

834
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:07,320
As my you know media servers for the house one one is the server and one is the backup

835
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:12,920
And I have it. Oh, yeah, that's beautiful. Gotta have that high

836
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:23,480
Can I do a last cribs episode I'm coming yeah, yeah by all means I'll have to clear out the spare room, but you're welcome

837
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,520
and I have experimented with so

838
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:32,120
Went way back before I had shortwave radio broadband

839
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:37,480
I used to use 3g to get on the internet and that was with a router with you know

840
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:42,200
It had a WAN port and a USB port where you could plug in your 3g dongle

841
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,560
So I've done that, you know high availability thing

842
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,360
briefly

843
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:50,280
But I've always been nervous about using these

844
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:55,560
More powerful home routers that you can plug USB do a whole bunch of things

845
01:04:55,560 --> 01:05:03,480
Yeah, because what because they're they're not very robust bits of kit and if they fail then you've lost everything

846
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:09,520
You haven't just lost internet connectivity. You've lost your LAN as well. So I sort of adopt the same

847
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,240
approach

848
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,720
to

849
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,240
to my kit

850
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:18,800
That I do with the home cinema, you know one device one job that makes sense

851
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:25,000
and and it's definitely been my approach for a really really long time because it just means that

852
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,440
you know troubleshooting is much easier updates are much straightforward a lot less to break, but I

853
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:36,200
Have to admit I have a new perspective now and that new perspective is

854
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,160
how many how much power does something draw and and

855
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:46,120
how much room does something take and the two things that are real premium for me right now our power draw and

856
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:49,500
The room that it takes up in and I'm talking like, you know

857
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:54,160
I'm trying to fit stuff like under a chair like it is really like under a bench seat. It is

858
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,160
really tight

859
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:02,080
So the the routers obviously don't take up much because they're arm powered and that they don't they don't

860
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:09,420
Take up much space and they don't draw much power. Yeah, true, but I would still separate things, you know on my father-in-law's barge

861
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:16,160
Had a wireless router with 3g and the file server there was a Raspberry Pi

862
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:20,480
This is back a couple of years now. Of course, I'd recommend using a Raspberry Pi 2

863
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:27,200
Doesn't draw much power. And in fact if you get one of those routers with the USB port on it

864
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:36,240
Check the specs carefully, but there are some you can actually power a Raspberry Pi off the USB port. Yeah, the router

865
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,400
Yeah, and then instead of you know, instead of going for

866
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,140
huge amounts of spinning storage on the Raspberry Pi

867
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:50,320
go for a bit less storage use an SSD connected to the USB port and

868
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:56,880
Then you don't need additional power to drive the SSD attached to the Raspberry Pi

869
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:02,600
Yeah, I agree. I even even in with limited space and limited power

870
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:09,200
I still think it's probably better to break them up and Wes got this. I can't remember the brand name of it now Wes

871
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,200
but you got me this

872
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:16,720
Router that it like it allows for different types of 3g connections. Yeah, how did that work?

873
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:20,560
Did you use it? No, I haven't yet because I'm waiting to connect it to a machine

874
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,500
But now actually probably over the next week or so

875
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:27,400
I probably will hook it up because I'm kind of now that I'm back in part with the rover

876
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:33,240
I'm kind of like working on like the technology land stuff because some of that stuff was like just too much to deal with

877
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:37,040
before the road drive and yeah, well it was like the my fives

878
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:42,160
Kind of act as routers and Wi-Fi access points. So for the for out for two weeks

879
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:46,160
They say solved a problem and I could make it work

880
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,400
But the biggest challenge was I was a minimum

881
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,600
It was either two different my fives or a cell phone that I was jumping between

882
01:07:54,600 --> 01:08:00,800
Yep, and every time on every device I'd have to go to each device and say okay now join this Wi-Fi Network that gets super

883
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,640
Old that router you got me totally solves that problem

884
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:09,360
so I think I'm gonna try that for a while and see how that shapes out and I'm gonna keep an eye on

885
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,680
this project and just kind of see if the

886
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:15,860
if did I think it's pronounced tourist you are our

887
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,160
is

888
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:23,120
Omnia if this results in something of substance, you know, it's kind of try this. It's kind of interesting

889
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:28,840
I was looking down at the bottom about us and they aren't responsible for some more enterprise-grade software. Yes

890
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,240
That's what gives me some hope. Yeah, go ahead

891
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:37,480
Yeah, like if you look here, they're talking about bird which is the an internet routing Damon open source that supports BSD's Linux

892
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:42,880
Yeah, you know, they do BGP OSPF. So it makes me think that this organization at least knows a little bit

893
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:47,640
It has experience about routing. Yes, exactly. That's it. That is a good point because that's what gave me hope

894
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,260
It made me okay

895
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:50,000
These have they have some credentials here

896
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,080
But I I'm trying to remember I don't know if you remember the name of it because I'm just I'm drawing a blank right now

897
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,320
But it is it was recommended by someone in the it was yeah

898
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:01,360
it is a unit that is essentially trying to accomplish this and then I

899
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,520
Agree with Wimpy's approach is whenever it's possible make

900
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,720
Make your your your edge of land device as

901
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,680
Single purpose as possible very much, right?

902
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:22,120
Because then it's if for security updates and reliability and troubleshooting and and really honestly from your own mistakes

903
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:27,800
It is much more isolated. And so the way I work is the further out to the edge of the land

904
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:33,960
I get the less and less stuff. I try to have that machine do and and a big a big

905
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:42,780
Big trend I have noticed from the tech snap audience is a lot of them want to virtualize their firewalls

906
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:50,660
Yeah, that is very more and more common. Yeah, it is like, you know, can I run my firewall my pf sense firewall as a VM?

907
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:54,140
You know, I'll give it a dedicated. I'll give it a dedicated Nick or whatever

908
01:09:54,140 --> 01:10:01,220
They say or the vertio driver and it just so goes. Yeah. Yeah, it just so goes against my like minimal like no

909
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:04,340
This is a router. That's all it's supposed to it kind of sounds like what wouldn't be saying too

910
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:10,820
It's like I don't like having it be a file server running Samba running SSH running all this different stuff

911
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:12,820
I don't want that and so

912
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:18,380
I'm gonna try scaling it back a bit, but I am definitely kind of relooking at some of the stuff now

913
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:23,700
I'm going oh, but I could save a lot of watts and a lot of space if I had one device doing it all

914
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:27,260
I also wouldn't mind just having a really beefy router like that's fine. Even if it's just as little

915
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:35,720
So I'm not quite sure where I'm gonna fall down on yet, but this is pretty neat and it's available for pre-order right now

916
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,980
I I you know, I'm you know what I'm gonna do

917
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:44,000
I'm gonna go and put myself down as a as a pos as a possibility and the pre-order right now

918
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,020
I'm just signing up for it. I'm joining you. Yeah

919
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:49,620
Yeah, cuz I'm curious to see where they go with this and I like that they're yeah. Yeah, there we go

920
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:54,500
So they I just I just went in and I just had I added myself to the pre-order list

921
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:59,480
I'm gonna give the Omni a try but my philosophy is more in line with yours and wimpy's

922
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:04,760
I think it's a I think it's a little safer to say this router is dedicated to do this thing

923
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:08,380
But we'll see wimpy any any other thoughts before we wrap up

924
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:15,300
Yeah, open media vaults available for the Raspberry Pi 2 now, so you really know

925
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,300
Oh

926
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:22,300
Yeah, the Raspberry Pi 2 and open media vault could be perfect

927
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:27,860
That could be perfect. Can I run MB on it? Cuz that's you know, I'm using MB in the rover

928
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:30,940
I want to do a little MB follow-up if I could actually because people been asking me about this

929
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:36,300
I bet that hasn't been I bet that hasn't been ported to the Raspberry Pi, but who knows?

930
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:42,140
I mean, I'm really enjoying MB. I've been using Plex still at the house in the studio, but in the rover

931
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:46,660
I am using MB. Well, look at me. I got three different places. I'm trying stuff and MB is really great

932
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:54,500
Are you are you using the Android client at all? No, no, I'm only using only using the web client at the moment

933
01:11:54,500 --> 01:12:00,300
Why what have you run into issues with the Android version? Yeah. Yeah, it's a bit stuttery and you know

934
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:06,180
I've noticed some of the similar the most recent version that I don't remember when I last updated

935
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,220
It seemed to be doing a lot better

936
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:13,020
But I have noticed a little occasional slow really once it gets up and running when you're streaming from your house on your Android

937
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:16,940
Device for me. It's more than like that the interface the actual stream has been fine

938
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:19,500
but kind of just like the startup and and those

939
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:24,060
Transitions have been a little slow you guys are not encouraging me to keep on with my MB exploration

940
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:28,500
But I mean I've been using it as well and the rest of it has been I've been can I mean I can you know

941
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:34,420
You can put a fully tight. I I mean that my use for MB is I want to build a small

942
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:40,300
Network in the rover and I want some I want a component of that network to be media on-demand

943
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:46,820
I'm not married to MB though. I will say I've been experimenting with the open and external player. Yeah. Yeah

944
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:52,060
Yeah, and I've got it configured right now. It seems to only want to detect VLC, but with a little XDG

945
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:56,220
You know like configuring your default apps. Yeah, I've got it one click opening in MPV

946
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:57,900
Are you telling me in the web browser?

947
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:04,300
You just click it it opens MPV and it that if you ever had a little like a little slowness when you're changing places

948
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,020
When you're using an MPV, of course, all of these amazing

949
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:12,580
Yeah, and it seems to be streaming the original quality just just beautiful doesn't market as read or as watched in MB

950
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:14,580
Yes that part. I haven't updated

951
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:17,540
Very recently. I think it's been a week or so. So they may have fixed it

952
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:22,900
There was like a recent little bug in that man, but the actual playback is flawless and they have a UI there

953
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:28,620
It just isn't quite fixed to have to have I'm gonna talk about that after air how well tell me right now

954
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:31,400
How do you make MB use MPV as your default player? What do you do?

955
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:36,240
Well, it has it has a I don't know if it's a plug-in or an option somewhere to enable external players

956
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,440
So you do lose like it doesn't track your progress, but you can enter it

957
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,680
You can't resume right so you lose your resume

958
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:45,760
But if you're if you're just watching an hour-long and I can remember if I remember a jump in a half hour

959
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,840
Right and then we be makes only gives that up to use MPV, right?

960
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:52,600
Or you can use Cody and not give up anything

961
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,600
Excellent point I

962
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,240
Would open a leg will work on the pies. Yes

963
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,800
I'm trying to keep it simple

964
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:06,240
I've got an MB server and I just want to go to the web page in the rover and watch stuff

965
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:10,800
That's all I want. I don't want to have to do too much more than that. But the MPV thing that is

966
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,040
You can send it to

967
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:19,680
Cody as well because Cody has an API that I'm actually working on a script to send stuff to Cody

968
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:25,200
Oh, and it will play through Cody and it will really to the server really won't be sending signals

969
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:31,880
It'll actually just send the it'll say here's what I want to play and then Cody will connect to it directly and you will

970
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:38,820
Keep all your sinking and everything. That's awesome. Oh, I think I think you guys are selling me on the rover setup

971
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:44,000
I mean the rover set up so early now that if I could have Cody look at MB and have all get it. Oh

972
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:52,000
Anyways, if you guys are not familiar with MB, we did an episode of Linux action show about MB vs. Plex. These are

973
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:58,760
Really really amazing home theater management solutions. They'll go out. They'll scan your directory. They'll go get all the metadata

974
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:03,680
They'll build a nice directory. They'll give you watch status pull an additional context. It's really cool

975
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:04,720
You can find it

976
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:10,800
MB dot media an open source solution to Plex and we dedicated an episode of the Linux action show to this particular topic

977
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:18,680
Because in the rover I wanted something that could completely work offline and not the Plex doesn't Plex works great offline

978
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,120
but Plex also assumes you have an internet connection all the time and

979
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:26,480
So MB allowed me to have a little bit of flexibility there and say, you know

980
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:33,040
I'm gonna be offline the majority of the time and when I am connected go fetch the metadata and those kinds of things MB

981
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,960
Allows me to have some flexibility there in the rover specifically that are really nice

982
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,000
I will say at least according to a forum post

983
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,520
It does look like there's an open media vault plug-in available the last the last post on the thread here was from July 2015

984
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:49,560
So hopefully it's updated in real. Oh my gosh. Love to try that. It's more about the architecture support, isn't it?

985
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:53,440
Yeah, right MB supported by open media vault. Yeah, so if you took an

986
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:57,780
You took not a NUC with open media vault and MB

987
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:05,640
Yeah, this is starting to look pretty nice. Yeah connected over what I scuzzy or an NFS maybe to a storage array. Oh

988
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:09,960
I have a few episodes in mind when I think of that. That's really cool

989
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,400
So anyways, if you want to check out this router

990
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:17,200
It is the tourist omnia and I signed up for a pre-order. I'll be I'm going to give it a I'm going to give it a go

991
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:23,480
I'm willing to give it a go. I like that. They have a built-in LAN switch. That's nice. I might not fiber right in there

992
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:28,320
That's interesting. Yes. Oh, yes, by the way. Yeah, that was that's that one right that little connector right there

993
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:33,120
Which is just at the bottom of the screen is a little a G bit connector, which is okay

994
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:39,560
All right. I'm not saying I'm would I would use this as my main switch, but it's definitely tempting and it might be tempting for you

995
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:42,200
To so go check it out and we'll have a link in the show notes

996
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:45,560
And if I do manage to get the pre-order, I'll let you know how it goes

997
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,560
So before we move on I want to thank our friends over at Linux Academy

998
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,560
There's something really cool going on at Linux Academy

999
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,600
And I want to tell you about it

1000
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,680
But first if you're new to Linux Academy

1001
01:16:55,680 --> 01:17:02,560
I want to sort of set up the framework what I really like about Linux Academy is I see a lot of common ground between them

1002
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,880
And Jupiter broadcasting they care a hell of a lot about content

1003
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:11,880
They care a hell of a lot about Linux and open source and they really want to deliver that to the people and so my approach

1004
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:17,380
Was let's go make podcasts about it. Their approach was let's go make educational content about it

1005
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:20,340
so they paired up with developers and content creators and

1006
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:26,560
Educators to make sure this could happen Linux enthusiasts the sat around and said we want to bring this to more people and that is

1007
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,840
Really truly unique about Linux Academy Linux and open source. It's not a checkbox

1008
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:35,920
They don't have a whole range of tutorials from fixing your sync and after effects tutorials

1009
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:41,120
What they have is stuff that is hyper focused on Linux and all of the technology stack around there

1010
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:47,200
I invite you to go check them out by going to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and get our really really great discount

1011
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:51,360
In fact, I will have I am now I am now very pleased to say our very exclusive

1012
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:58,280
Discount is the only way to get this pricing structure. It is exclusive to Linux unplugged show Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

1013
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:03,360
Go check that out go tour their features. They have almost 1,900 videos for the self-paced courses

1014
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,540
Downloadable comprehensive study guides and instructor help is available to you when you need it

1015
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:13,780
that is a really big deal and a huge differentiator between the other online learning courses and

1016
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:19,320
On October 15th. Oh my gosh, that's really soon

1017
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:26,200
Actually, they have some major major major features. They are rolling out really big things are coming on October 15th

1018
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,460
They say and this is their words not mine

1019
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:34,440
They're working on their biggest new tool for the last four months and they're gonna be releasing it on October 15th

1020
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:39,000
It's the result of a dream. They had this time a year ago. It's going to change

1021
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:43,320
Self-paced and hands-on training as we know it

1022
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,600
Also, they just updated their CDN

1023
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:53,680
So the content is even faster than before and the players have a new version of their HTML 5 player with speed controls

1024
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:57,520
So you can speed up or slow down the videos, which is really cool

1025
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:04,080
And there has been actually some studies as a podcaster. I looked into this when you listen to podcasts at double speed

1026
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,160
You actually retain the data more Wow

1027
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:12,480
Didn't know that but the brain because it's working a little bit harder to listen at a faster pace

1028
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:19,540
Retains the information faster. How cool is that for your training and now their new HTML 5 player supports that that's really great

1029
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:24,500
But something else has just come out at Linux Academy that I think you need to know about. This is a huge deal

1030
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,860
practice exams

1031
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:32,020
Practice exams are the secret weapon to actually beating the test. I

1032
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:36,340
For whatever reason get a little weird about taking tests

1033
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:40,140
I don't know. I don't know what it is, but I just get a little weird about taking tests

1034
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:44,620
It's just like I'm being put on the spot next week on linux and plugged we give we

1035
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:51,580
We've got a quiz or two. It'll be great fun. Submit your questions online guys. Actually, that would be really cool. That'd be really good

1036
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:56,340
We should do that as an episode if anybody has suggestions out there for an online Linux quiz that we could take

1037
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:00,020
We should do it. We should do it. You can hear me

1038
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:04,740
I'll get totally worked up like I'm not kidding you guys I freak out over our rock-paper-scissors session

1039
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:10,020
Okay, so I'm not kidding. So the idea of taking a test it really overwhelms me

1040
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:16,420
And so that's Linux Academy recognizes that and they have a solution. So in the past and and and still available today

1041
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:18,860
In fact better than ever you have regular mode exams

1042
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:23,740
This is where Linux Academy loads in a preset of number of questions in a preset amount of time

1043
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:25,660
You go through the exam, you know

1044
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:29,220
Like for example, you could take the AWS CSA associates in regular mode

1045
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:34,140
It'll load 60 questions in 80 minutes and you complete the exam like a real exam

1046
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:39,180
That's cool and gives you a very very real-world like experience

1047
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:44,860
However, if that to you would stress you out like it would me check out practice mode

1048
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:50,900
Now you can select your time limit and the number of questions up to a maximum amount of potential questions from the pool and then

1049
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:52,900
Just take the practice exam

1050
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:59,940
This helps you prepare in a different way than you would normally for the exam and it puts flexibility in the practice exam system

1051
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:02,460
Based on your current needs. So here's a summary of what you get

1052
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:04,740
You get to display the total number of questions in exam questions

1053
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:08,740
All practice exams are now timed if time runs out it automatically submits the questions

1054
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:14,700
you're currently going for and grades them practice mode allows you to define the number of questions and time limits for an exam sessions and

1055
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,700
the question order is randomized and

1056
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:21,540
Answers associated with the question are also randomized and each new practice exam is started

1057
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:25,660
This is such a cool way for you to be able to go in and find out the questions that are on the test

1058
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:29,300
Try them learn them do your studying see how you did

1059
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:35,260
So that way when you sit down to actually get your certification, it is a slam dunk this right here

1060
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:39,340
I'm telling you is worth the price alone of admission to Linux Academy go to linuxacademy.com

1061
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:45,580
Unplugged to get our discount and try that out a lot of new features. Check out their big presentation, October 15th

1062
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:46,500
So much is coming

1063
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:53,140
I love to see this company continue to grow because you know why they're promoting Linux at the same time Linux Academy comm slash

1064
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:56,780
Unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

1065
01:21:56,780 --> 01:22:02,660
All right, so guys as we wrap up today on the unplugged show

1066
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:07,180
It was actually I think it was West's fault. I think this is totally your fault

1067
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:11,220
Again way to go West jerk

1068
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:16,700
So you think you made an offhand comment about why don't we just end curses everything?

1069
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:23,420
Everything should be an end curses UI. Well, you know what King Looper was paying attention when you said that

1070
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:26,900
He said an episode going in depth on cursors to available links would be a great idea

1071
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:29,620
There are so many anchors of programs out there

1072
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:35,440
I think an episode on it really could be interesting not only anchors of programs for everything in true Linux fashion

1073
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:39,700
There are at least four of them with programs from CMUS to H top

1074
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:45,820
There is a lot of content to cover this episode could show off a lot of new useful tools to viewers to exact for example

1075
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:49,180
CMUS makes great media player, especially when paired with drop-down

1076
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:51,660
terminal

1077
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:56,300
Now this happens to coincide perfectly with the end of tech talk today

1078
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:01,060
It was suggested that we have a mumble app picks segment in the Linux unplugged show

1079
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:05,740
So I wanted to turn it over to the mumble room now Wes and I have a couple to go to's

1080
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:09,580
But I wanted to turn it over to the mumble room if anyone in there has any suggestions

1081
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:14,780
For really really great and curses based applications now for those of you not familiar

1082
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:16,860
I don't know how this is possible

1083
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:24,200
But think of end curses as the best interface ever created that never needs to be replaced and never should be superseded and curses

1084
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:29,660
applications are console applications that essentially have a UI I

1085
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:35,740
You know I'd look at this Wes and curses actually even has an entry on Wikipedia. Here's a great example of

1086
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:41,220
Configuring the Linux kernel I believe the BSD installer is end curses based

1087
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:47,180
I believe a lot of things are in curses based Alan is am I right is is anchors is still a thing on BSD as well? Yeah

1088
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:51,900
So well, uh, the tool is called dialog and then it uses anchors is to draw the stuff

1089
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:56,980
So yeah now do you Alan I while I have you do you have any anchors is apps that you've used from time to time?

1090
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:03,860
Or the biggest one is dialog, which is a way to write to use anchors interfaces from a shell script

1091
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:07,020
Yeah, so the entire installer is written in shell script

1092
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:13,460
But it just asks you the questions and present you the menus by calling the dialog command which draws an anchors is menu for you

1093
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:18,500
There's a good one and and it is universally like, you know

1094
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:23,020
When it is universally like if you have a terminal you've probably at some point in time

1095
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:28,540
Seeing an anchors application and Steve jerbs in the chat room

1096
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:34,420
Steve jerbs has a has a recommendation called a T IG and

1097
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:41,660
He says in the chat room is one of my favorite dev tools. It's a text mode interface for get how cool is that Wes?

1098
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:44,940
How about that? Oh, I'm excited already. Yeah, that is really neat

1099
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:51,020
So if anybody the mumble room wants to chime in with their favorite anchors application, the floor is open to you

1100
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:54,060
I'm saving mine to see if anybody else guesses them

1101
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:59,220
Torrent is also quite nice, which is when you're trying to do stuff service our tour. Yeah, that's a great one

1102
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:04,420
If you're trying to see it from a server, it's just be able to pop it up over SSH. Yeah

1103
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:11,540
Yeah, our torrent is killer our torrent and I think like version 9 0.9 is the current version or something like that

1104
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:14,140
I'll put a link to our torrent our torrent is great

1105
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:18,940
In fact our torrent just a little tip is a great resource to put on your digital ocean drop

1106
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:22,100
You pop that in the BSD license team us and away you go

1107
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:29,660
Our turn I'm gonna put a link there because honestly our turns one of the more common things that I hear people are using on

1108
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:35,100
Their digital ocean droplets we chat we chat is has a and curses based interface. Is that real?

1109
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:39,740
Elman elman coming in from the chat room. How about that?

1110
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:43,460
Your see

1111
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:50,940
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Look at this. Look at elman

1112
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:57,180
Oh, I'm installing elman this might grab this might become a last pick. Look at these guys. Oh, that's me. Hi. Hi

1113
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:59,420
Here it is. Here's the shot

1114
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:00,980
Look at that

1115
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:02,060
Wow

1116
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:07,920
That is really really nice and wimpy you got to mention my favorite. Come on wimpy. Give me a plug for nano. Let's hear it

1117
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:14,180
Yeah, I love nano. Yeah, and a great example of it anchors is based a full application

1118
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:21,980
Yeah, I like that one a lot. All right, any other guy any other? Yeah, there's a the new architect installer

1119
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:28,180
Architect Linux is in curses installer for arch architect Linux our

1120
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:31,060
Linux, all right. I'm putting a link to that

1121
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:36,060
If you've ever heard of evolution Linux, it's it's a yes successor to evolution evolution is gone

1122
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:39,180
But it was been it was it was turned into architect

1123
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:45,060
The live installer for Linux brought to you by Karl Duff and yeah, there it is that gorgeous

1124
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:49,700
Ode to ode to end curses. You know what? I don't know what it is, but I

1125
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:55,420
Love it. I love the little outline. I love the lines. I love the ok button

1126
01:26:55,420 --> 01:27:01,500
I love the title at the top with the line underneath it. It's so clear. It's so it's so

1127
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:08,060
Obvious, it's like a nice latex formatted scientific. Yes that same kind of let you know where everything's gonna be

1128
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:15,100
Yes, just right where you expect. Yes, and my keyboard hotkeys work. I mean it is I don't mean to sound like an old man

1129
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:26,980
But I think it is truly one of the best interfaces ever rain before my eyes here guys. I think if you if you're interested in using in curses and you also want good UI like design look

1130
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:35,240
Yes, not now not now no no no no it's been for a very long time which is awesome

1131
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:42,100
Right. I'm saying now as in everything that their installer is. Yes. So it's all in curses. Everything they do is now

1132
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:48,940
Yes, every everything that they have so much now into yes, and now yes is completely in curses

1133
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:52,700
No, it's a good-looking in curses as in design and everything

1134
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:57,300
So it doesn't even necessarily look like in curses, but it's reliable just like it was. Yeah

1135
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:57,660
Yeah

1136
01:27:57,660 --> 01:28:03,940
And I I love that about openSUSE of because when you're installing a machine a server remotely

1137
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:08,020
That particular feature is extremely extremely valuable

1138
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:14,500
It's very very nice to have that because also one of the things that the openSUSE installer has supported for a very long time is

1139
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:19,620
You can spin up a VNC server over the network and install the system headless using VNC

1140
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:25,500
Which is extremely cool and of course, I got to give a plug Corky beta is pointed out in the chat room

1141
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:33,100
You got to love midnight commander one of the old-school and curses based file managers for the command like a classic

1142
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:37,540
Midnight commander is very awesome a network manager

1143
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:42,620
There's a hold on hold on network manager has a has a and curses interface

1144
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:47,680
No way is that a thing I'd be really interested. I used to use wick d or wicked

1145
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:52,620
Yes, but I guess that's not maintained anymore. No, I would love another curses based Wi-Fi manager

1146
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:56,020
Yeah, look at this on December 2013. I'm apparently this is old-school news

1147
01:28:56,460 --> 01:29:01,460
Network manager gets a new text interface while network manager already has a great integration with Nome and KD desktops

1148
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,300
There's now a command line interface

1149
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:08,040
It's an open source network management program has the end curses based interface. Look at that

1150
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:12,980
So we eat that is very cool and then colonel panic. Is that how you say that one West?

1151
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:17,740
What do you think colonel colonel panic, but a little bit? It's not spelled with a K. It's colonel

1152
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:21,380
See with that see I'm saying they see oh and yes, but that's a military

1153
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:27,260
Colonel, okay. All right. All right fine. He goes with it. He's got I think a python debugger here

1154
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:30,280
Which is an end curses interface? Oh interesting. Look at that

1155
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:34,560
I'm really surprised that nobody has said our two end curses picks yet

1156
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,880
You and I have two really good ones, and I'm surprised

1157
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:44,240
This is colonel panic. Oh my god Chris, but colonel's panic is spelled with a K. I know he's already taken that one

1158
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:45,280
All right

1159
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:48,520
Are you anybody else in the mumber and want to throw out their favorite end curses app before?

1160
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,280
Noah and Arab Noah before Wes and I give away the

1161
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:58,640
The best I think we have some really good ones. I think so. All right, nobody's chiming in Wes

1162
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,640
You mentioned this one last week

1163
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:02,600
ncdu

1164
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:06,560
Love ncdu a super fast utility you go into a directory

1165
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:11,240
You can say like ncdu and you can give it a directory you can give it the root and it goes through and scans your disk

1166
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:16,540
Usage in real time. It is so so nice. In fact, I should probably just install it right now. It's so nice

1167
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:22,180
I'm gonna install it right now now. I like as well that you can have it export so like we at work

1168
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:24,480
We've got some scripts that all that'll run that as well

1169
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:28,680
So when it has a disk, you know, a host has disk space that's above above what we've said is warning

1170
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:32,920
It'll have saved already on the back end really you can just pop that up. You don't have to rescan it

1171
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:34,160
You can just explore visually

1172
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:39,720
I went to go show it I went to go show ncdu on the live stream and it worked so fast that I couldn't actually

1173
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:47,440
Show you it processing my directories. It's way faster than any graphical tool is way faster and here you can say you can see

1174
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,440
I'm I'm wasting a ridiculous

1175
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:53,240
fifty one point seven gigabytes on this bonobo to the Dropbox

1176
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:58,640
That is and you know what's crazy about that. That is a fraction of what is actually in the Dropbox

1177
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:05,560
Let's see here. Does it what is this Dropbox tell you how much space you're using now? Yeah, I'm using that. Oh my god

1178
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:09,480
Oh my god. Do you have a guess how much space I'm using in Dropbox?

1179
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:13,700
Just take just a rough guess just one guess I'll just take one guess

1180
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:20,040
Because here you go. Here you go with 51 gigs are just on this bonobo just on the bonobo on this bonobo alone

1181
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:26,080
So you can assume this is probably just the files. I need just us them just for the show production. I'm gonna guess

1182
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:31,360
700 gigabytes. Oh, that's pretty good. That's pretty good. That's pretty good two terabytes. Oh

1183
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:36,000
Terabytes up in that Dropbox so any enterprise

1184
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:43,160
It's ridiculous. So ncdu is a really really really nice tool that West mentioned last week

1185
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:48,760
That is a very nice straightforward way to go through and so you can see like so say I wasn't gonna go

1186
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:54,280
Delete stuff out of my Dropbox folder, but I wanted to go look at some my other big offenders here downloads

1187
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:59,840
I go into there you can see look and look at all look at five gigs going to gunsmoke old-time radio right worth it

1188
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,520
Don't get rid. I know I'm not

1189
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:05,420
1.3 gigabytes is going to X minus one another old-time radio show and then another

1190
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,360
337 is going to Superman

1191
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:11,100
But I can easily see where a lot of my storage space is going to in my downloads folder

1192
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:15,980
Which is really really nice and the other really nice thing about this is it works great through an SSH connection

1193
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:19,920
So when you're remote it into that system, you know a hegemon eight in the IRC

1194
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:24,100
He's got a great point also mixer something we take for granted. That's that's curses. What is it?

1195
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:31,320
Awesome. Yeah. Yeah, and there's also there's a pulse audio controller. That's also in curses based, which is really cool and thin

1196
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:36,800
There's another app that I I love two things now telegram is an end curses base

1197
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:41,440
But there is a telegram command-line client, which is really cool for drop-down menu. I haven't tried. Yeah. Yeah

1198
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:46,200
Talks to X now you're familiar with talks. It's kind of like a Skype killer open source

1199
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:53,000
Yeah in the shadow of Edward Snowden that kind of came out right and it grows it blossoms in the shadow of Edward Snowden and

1200
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,360
There is toxic

1201
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:58,200
toxic is a tox based instant messaging client and

1202
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:03,040
You guessed it has an end curses interface so you can use talks

1203
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:09,760
In the command-line like say association to a droplet or something like that using end curses. This is my pick

1204
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,760
This is I think a really I'm like

1205
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:16,640
Super remiss for not mentioning pipe cut. Oh, yeah. Oh

1206
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:24,440
So pipe cut is this tool to allow you to like when you're when you're dealing with data on Unix, right?

1207
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:31,920
You do like some file cat file pipe grep for something and then sort and then unique minus C

1208
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:36,320
And then sort numerically by the results of that to get and then pipe tail or something like that

1209
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:41,480
Right to get the lab the top ten most popular IP addresses in your web server log or something

1210
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:48,440
this allows you to build those interactively and surf back and forth through your pipe and like when you're

1211
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:52,240
Applying a grep filter it will highlight on the screen

1212
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:56,320
What things you're going to match and what things aren't as you're writing the regular so really stands out

1213
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:02,880
That is so nice. Yeah, I'm looking at their site website right now pipe cut at pipe cut dot org

1214
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:10,440
This is really a presentation. We interviewed the author and did a presentation about it at meet PSD. It is really cool

1215
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:14,400
Yeah, it is. Holy crap. I'm saving this one to go grab after the show

1216
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:19,440
It seems like a great tool to help. I mean one professionals the two people trying to learn. Yeah pipes

1217
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:26,680
Yes, it's like the best teaching tool ever. Yeah. Well, it really illustrates what you're doing, which is really cool

1218
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:32,240
All right. So how about this one this one coming in from Corky our TV our TV?

1219
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:35,460
No, it's not something for your trailer. It's an end curses

1220
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,360
reddit client a

1221
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:44,440
reddit terminal viewer right there our TV is an application allows you to view and interact with reddit from your terminal. Oh

1222
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,600
I love it. That is so cool. That makes reddit so much better

1223
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:54,100
That makes it so you know getting something like reddit out of the web is I don't know

1224
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:59,260
It's pretty cool. Our TV is built on Python using as you guessed it the curses library

1225
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:02,300
Really really neat. That's a good one

1226
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:05,340
IP traf is another great one. I agree

1227
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:10,940
LFTP something if top yes H top was which was mentioned earlier in the show

1228
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:15,220
I'm gonna put a links to as many of these as that were mentioning as possible in the show notes

1229
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:19,700
So that way you get you guys can check this out. I here's what I love about it. What's that?

1230
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:27,820
A callback to earlier in the show up in WRT has in curses. Mm-hmm. Nice. That is really here's what I here's what?

1231
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:33,100
Here's the point. I want to make I don't think end curses interfaces are out of date or old-school at all

1232
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:37,820
I think there's still a very practical application for a text-based GUI. Yep, and

1233
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:42,740
With VPS is and and cloud computing and becoming more and more common

1234
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:47,220
I think they have a better place than ever like I think these are really really good stuff

1235
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:49,900
So Linux actually showed our reddit.com, please

1236
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:55,300
Please tell me about your favorite end curses based application for episode 114 find the feedback thread

1237
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:57,580
I would really like to hear about them. I want to try them out

1238
01:35:57,580 --> 01:36:02,920
I'm all in like I'm like screw gooey's right now and just speaking of gooey's though

1239
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:09,220
If you write your shell script thing in dialogue, you can substitute dialogue for X dialog

1240
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:16,500
Get the gooey version too. Very nice. Very nice. What we gonna say with I just say it's nice that you know

1241
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:20,900
It's just like a terminal away. Yeah, you already have your terminal open. Yeah, someone listening to this show. Yeah

1242
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:27,860
You don't have to learn a new GUI you're already familiar with that right as applications work and

1243
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:32,620
Corky beta says if you give it a good color scheme and curses can be the most modern UI ever

1244
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:40,940
I was just gonna make that joke. All right rotten corpse. You want to take us out with our last end curses pick here

1245
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:47,700
Yeah, see us music player. Yes. Yes. See us music player at I I'm familiar

1246
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:49,420
They have there's an arch wiki entry on it

1247
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:52,940
but I think they're just on a CMUS CMUS that github.io and

1248
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:57,700
It's a small fast powerful concert music player for Unix like operating systems

1249
01:36:57,700 --> 01:37:03,100
So even you Mac users can get a little something out of that one CMUS. That's a good one rotten

1250
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:08,020
Man, I'm really for some reason all of a sudden. I'm sitting here. I'm getting super

1251
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:14,060
Foreclamped over end curses based applications like anything I could run out of a terminal. I'm all about these days

1252
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:16,140
So those are really good ones. Thank you guys

1253

1256
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:36,100
Regardless of our shows it's also just a popular way for people to talk about cool open source projects and that helps the show

1270
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:05,980
All

1271
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:22,900
Right that show moved on do you feel like that show moved yeah, whoo yeah, all right all right very good very good

1272
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:28,260
All right, so we go to JB titles. We pick our title, and then we all feel like we accomplished something doesn't that feel good

1273
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:30,260
Yes, it does

1274
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:35,540
Good stuff and curses apps are fun for me for some reason. I'm an old man. It's just fun

1275
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:39,320
Yeah, I like this title suggesting Katie connect all the things I

1276
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:44,940
Look at Microsoft and all of their company resources all of their employees all of their money

1277
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:48,140
And then they ship a product that looks like this

1278
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:53,020
Right and makes noises like that. I don't want to make it noises like that. I don't even know why it made that noise

1279
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:57,100
It didn't tell me anything. Why did it make that noise? Why does it do these things?

1280
01:39:57,100 --> 01:40:02,460
Why is there so much contrast in the in the Explorer Windows? Why are the fonts so small is with this menu?

1281
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:08,140
It's like transparent, so you can't you can't even read it. You can't even read it and the thing is nobody talks about this

1282
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:10,820
Nobody talks about it. It's fine now

1283
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:17,620
You know Katie he's got a funky font or gnomes got a corn that's not perfectly rounded or the Mac does something

1284
01:40:17,620 --> 01:40:24,300
That's not perfect, and it's all it's all we talked about a freaking. It's a huge deal Windows is a complete and total

1285
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:31,260
presentation crap show with three different types of interfaces built into it three different uis built into it and

1286
01:40:31,580 --> 01:40:35,280
Nobody gives it a hard time everybody gives it a pass even we do this is

1287
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:42,420
Disgusting look at that. You can't even read that it's gross and and yet not nobody says anything. I can explain that completely

1288
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:44,740
Let's hear it

1289
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:49,420
Standards I agree standards that are not using Windows and everybody knows Windows is complete. I agree

1290
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:55,220
I think I think we collectively just been like oh well Windows is the challenge kid in the classroom

1291
01:40:55,220 --> 01:41:00,260
And so we don't expect as much from Windows. Oh look Windows. How's that? It has the start menu that slides up real nice?

1292
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:02,340
Oh look what a good job Windows is done

1293
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:08,640
Windows has done such a great job. Yeah, exactly yeah, the Windows gets its trophy. They had a release

1294
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:11,620
They couldn't even get their numbering right they couldn't even count correctly I

1295
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:17,100
Just think yeah, I can't stand it as an operating system

1296
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:21,700
It is so awful it is so awful and then so the thing the line

1297
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:26,020
I have to walk is and how do you not judge people who want to use Windows people who choose to use Windows?

1298
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:27,900
How do you know because they have their own valid reasons?

1299
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:30,620
And they probably spend a lot of time making Windows suck a lot less

1300
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:36,140
They probably don't even realize how much energy they put into making Windows suck less over like they set up a Windows box

1301
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:47,500
And they probably spend three months getting it not sucking a lot of work. Yeah, it's the worst dude Windows is the worst
