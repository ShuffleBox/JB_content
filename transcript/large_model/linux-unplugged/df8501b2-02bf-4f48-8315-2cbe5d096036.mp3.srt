1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,120
I wonder if you could place what that sound is.

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,040
I would not be able to, but it's something actually pretty nerdy.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:23,240
There is a post by Dan Maloney on Hackaday about how they were able to connect a Crunch

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:32,080
Bang Linux box to a teletype, a 1930s teletype, and print out the console information right

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,760
there on the teletype.

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,760
Here's what it sounds like when the dude logs into his machine.

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,760
I should do it.

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:57,600
I'll put myself in lowercase mode here, so.

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,120
I have a shell prompt, so that's where we'll see if my lowercase works.

10
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,000
And you're seeing right there character returns and every command prompt that would come up.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,600
You have to sit there and wait for it to print.

12
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,920
Yeah, it turns out at 45.5 bps, things are pretty slow.

13
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,880
Also, this was way before ASCII was invented.

14
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,080
It was the Bado code, so they had to use a custom little mega chip, or you could use

15
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,920
an Arduino or something to tune the translation because ASCII didn't exist yet.

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,920
Pretty wild.

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,480
It's really worth the link in the show notes.

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,840
Linux Unplugged dot com slash 350.

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,400
You gotta check this out.

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:43,880
It's super nerdy.

21
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,520
Hello friends and welcome into episode 350 of your weekly Linux talk show.

22
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,520
My name is Chris.

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,520
My name is Wes.

24
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,520
350 feels good, Wes.

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
It's an achievement.

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
That's all right.

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
It feels real good.

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,120
Coming up on today's program, we're taking a look at Ubuntu 20.04, the next big LTS from

29
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,960
Canonical, the Fuchsia, if you will.

30
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,600
We're going to look at the main release, as well as some of the details in the flavor,

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,040
some goodies you can expect in there, our experience of it on the kernel, my experience

32
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:21,200
with the Raspberry Pi 4, and as well as just our general impressions using this new release.

33
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,660
Plus, we have a whole bunch of community news, some pics to get into, and a lot more.

34
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,440
So before we go any further, I gotta say hello to that virtual lug.

35
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,080
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

36
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Hey.

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
Hello.

38
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
Hello.

39
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
Linux Tuesday happiness.

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
Howdy.

41
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
Oh my goodness.

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
Whoa.

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Woo.

44
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,520
I mean, how incredible is that, really?

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,040
I mean, you can't make heads or tails of it, but you can tell it's impressive.

46
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,880
It's sheer Linux passion.

47
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,000
It is so much passion.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,140
There are like 58 people in here.

49
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,460
It's a record, I think.

50
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,460
It's pretty great.

51
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,460
So hello, everybody.

52
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,460
Glad to have you there.

53
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,760
It's a fun episode.

54
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,600
And some of you were there for our virtual lug hangout on Sunday that wrapped up after,

55
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,400
I think, Computer Kid was saying eight hours.

56
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
I was only there for a couple.

57
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
Wow.

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,080
But that was a lot of fun.

59
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,320
So we have a lot to get into today.

60
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,600
I wanted to start with the news like we usually do, pulling in a few more headlines these

61
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,620
days that may have made it in LAN into Linux Unplugged to try to give them some attention.

62
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,500
And one that got my attention is some improvements that Tuxedo is making to the user experience

63
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,720
with a new power and thermal control center for their Linux systems.

64
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,360
Yeah, if you don't remember, Tuxedo is a German Linux PC vendor, and they've launched the

65
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,840
Tuxedo Control Center to provide a GUI driven control plane for management thermal and power

66
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,420
settings on your systems, provides a basic dashboard and control area for creating power

67
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,960
and thermal profiles, tuning the CPU power management behavior and related features.

68
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,720
Now, of course, much of this functionality has already been available via third party

69
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
utilities.

70
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,400
But it's nice to see this sort of baked right in, especially for maybe new Linux users,

71
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
right?

72
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,760
Maybe they're exact customer base who wants something that's a little more out of the

73
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,240
box and ready to go.

74
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,240
The Tuxedo Control Center is open source.

75
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,200
It initially will be available with easy access for Ubuntu and openSUSE users.

76
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,560
But there's no reason it really couldn't be packaged up more broadly.

77
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,600
I'm not sure what they've used to build this.

78
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,120
But what you end up with is icons that represent things like cooling and power.

79
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,640
And then you just sort of click around to get the desired configuration.

80
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,480
Going to look at GitHub, it does seem to be an Electron app.

81
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,200
Now, there are some downsides there.

82
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,600
But it should mean getting it running on whatever distro you eventually choose to use should

83
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
be a snap.

84
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
See what I did there.

85
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
I do.

86
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,480
And it is actually even simpler than so you probably will see it and like like we were

87
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,280
kind of thinking it's using just back end tools that are already available, but it's

88
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,560
bringing it all in one place.

89
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,360
So it seems like that should be pretty notable.

90
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,280
Speaking of Linux laptops, though, you got me a Lemure Pro from System 76.

91
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,080
It may actually arrive while we're recording.

92
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,980
So if you hear old ding dong on the door, that's probably my laptop and then I'll be

93
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,980
very distracted.

94
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,980
I know, right?

95
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,320
I went through and kind of did like a pre configure on what I would buy if I was going

96
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,520
to get a little more pro.

97
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,140
I decided I'd keep it with the base 4.2 gigahertz i5.

98
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,960
It is tempting to go to the i7 4.9.

99
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,480
It's only $200 more.

100
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,360
But I just don't know if I'd really notice the difference and I might save a little power

101
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
and temperature.

102
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Yeah.

103
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Look at you being reasonable today.

104
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,680
I know.

105
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,480
And because I'm a gentleman, I went with 24 gigs of RAM.

106
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
I don't need 40.

107
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
Oh, come on.

108
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
But 40.

109
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
I know.

110
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
How could you resist?

111
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
What's the price difference?

112
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,560
It felt like the sweet spot.

113
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
It was a $60 upgrade.

114
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
That's not bad.

115
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Yeah.

116
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,840
And then to go to 40 gigs, it's like a lot more than that.

117
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:45,220
And then for OS, I upgraded from the standard 240 gigabyte SSD to a one terabyte MVME.

118
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,420
That's what I would go with.

119
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,920
And that was a $280 ish bump in price, but that seems like it'd be worth it.

120
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,440
You can get a second MVME drive, but I didn't bother.

121
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,880
Again, going supes reasonable.

122
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,400
And I didn't tweak anything else with it.

123
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
That's all I changed.

124
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,080
I just adjusted those couple of things.

125
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,960
So I kept the one year warranty.

126
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,520
I didn't buy the extra power adapter.

127
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,800
Actually, I almost always buy the extra power adapter.

128
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,320
I mean, you're going to lose one of them.

129
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Yeah.

130
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
So I'll go ahead and add that.

131
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Let's be real real sticker.

132
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:20,240
If I was going to buy this, my grand total for the new LeMouwer Pro would be $1,564.

133
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,240
Not too bad.

134
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
Probably not.

135
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,200
When you consider you can hardly even get into a decent MacBook for less than two grand.

136
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,720
I mean, this will be a multi year machine for sure.

137
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
Yeah.

138
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,200
So that's coming and I'll have a review for it.

139
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,880
I don't actually know what configuration they sent because it's a review unit and I did

140
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,000
not spec it, but I am very much looking forward to trying it.

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,320
It's good timing for me right now.

142
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,560
I'm sort of in the zone for a new laptop, you know what I mean?

143
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,280
ThinkPad's great, but that screen.

144
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,920
Yeah, that's really the limiting factor.

145
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,800
And those speakers.

146
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,080
So bad.

147
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,960
You know what, I use my speakers.

148
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
I use my speakers.

149
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,880
Turns out there's a lot of audio clips to listen to.

150
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,780
It's just so bad.

151
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,960
We still laugh about how bad the speakers are on our ThinkPads.

152
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Almost every week really.

153
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,200
It's a great machine, powerful, gets work done, great battery life.

154
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,120
I love it, but there could be some improvements.

155
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
Yeah.

156
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,980
So I checked the old UPS shipping tracker and it is in our town right now.

157
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,160
So it's supposed to get here today.

158
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
It's coming for us.

159
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
So listen for the ding dong.

160
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
It may be here.

161
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,360
Wouldn't that be great if it just got here during housekeeping or something?

162
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,200
The Limor Pro will be probably in next week's episode or the week after, just depending

163
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,680
on how much time I get to spend reviewing it properly.

164
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,520
If you've got any questions, LinuxUnplug.com slash contact or at Chris LAS on the Twitter.

165
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
Start sending them in now and let me know and I'll try to incorporate them into the

166
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,840
old review.

167
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:41,360
Now we don't always talk about software forks here on the podcast because let's be honest,

168
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,700
there's a lot of them.

169
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,280
But when we do talk about software forks, we talk about the good ones.

170
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,400
And this seems like one of them.

171
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,280
I have so much appreciation and respect for what the entire Plasma project team has done,

172
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,360
but specifically the folks that work on Kaywin.

173
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,240
However, in this last week, a new fork was announced.

174
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,320
It's called Kaywin FT with a goal to accelerate the development and better improve Wayland

175
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,960
support.

176
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,840
And maybe the more interesting thing about it is who's doing the fork.

177
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,300
Yeah, this was announced by Roman Gilk, the same developer who became a contractor for

178
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,980
Valve last year.

179
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,180
And part of his work there was actually to improve Kaywin.

180
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,880
So it looks like this may have come as a result of that previous work.

181
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,360
What's interesting about Kaywin FT, as the fork is known, is that it's supposed to be

182
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,760
a drop-in replacement for KDE's window manager Kaywin and the accompanying underlying Kay

183
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,220
Wayland library.

184
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,480
So for the moment, this may break as you know, more changes are added to the project.

185
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,760
But right now, you can just drop it in.

186
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,160
Okay, so that drop-in replacement thing, I guess that makes sense.

187
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,120
You know, if you're just starting to fork, you're making probably minimal changes at

188
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,880
first, so it would be compatible.

189
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,920
And you want it to be sort of easy for developers to write, actually get it running on their

190
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,840
system and test those changes.

191
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,160
That said, it's pretty freaking cool that if you're on Manjaro and you have the unstable

192
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:13,960
repos turned on, you can just replace Kaywin with this, and it's supposedly in a lot better

193
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
shape.

194
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,640
Essentially, what the developer says, what Roman said was that he looked at making these

195
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,360
changes directly in mainline Kaywin, but the project has a very real-world constraint.

196
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,400
And that is people use it.

197
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,520
A lot of people use it.

198
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,160
I mean, it can be really difficult to totally re-architect, fix, you know, things that have

199
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,880
been assumed and at the base of the project for years and years, especially when there's

200
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,240
so many passionate Plasma users out there.

201
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,840
And you have what we all love to call as stakeholders.

202
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,440
You got lots of stakeholders with a project like Kaywin.

203
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
We love Kaywin.

204
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,480
But wouldn't you be pretty mad if you just upgrade, you didn't realize there'd been these

205
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,240
major changes were in there and suddenly your desktop starts crashing?

206
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,240
I would be.

207
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,960
Yeah, there's all those use cases they have to accommodate.

208
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:03,080
So I think when the developer, Roman Gligg, or Gilg, when he came up against

209
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:10,440
these constraints and saw what he classified as really significant problems, and I don't

210
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,640
know how true that is, but when you read his actual post, his original post, in his estimation,

211
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,840
there were alarmingly, like, I think he used the word shockingly bad.

212
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,080
It is always a little difficult to tell.

213
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,880
I mean, one developer's shock is another developer's like, yeah, we know about these problems.

214
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,140
We're working on them, but it's hard to fix.

215
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,960
One developer's shock and awe is another developer's everyday technical debt.

216
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
Right.

217
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Yeah, exactly.

218
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,960
There are some interesting things that have already been included, including a rework

219
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,800
of Kaywin's composition pipeline.

220
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,920
That sounds like a big deal, especially since according to some early feedback, it improves

221
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,040
the presentation greatly on both X11 and Wayland.

222
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,940
Plus there's a new timer that helps minimize the latency from image creation to actually

223
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,940
getting it on your screen.

224
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,840
And we all want things to be fast.

225
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:03,920
The other thing that's nice is support for the Wayland viewporter extension, which enables

226
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,180
better presentation of content.

227
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:11,400
For example, video players and with the next X Wayland release, emulating resolution changes

228
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,460
for older games.

229
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,760
So if you've got some older game, it expects to be run at some super tiny resolution that

230
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,800
should just work better under Wayland.

231
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
That actually will be nice.

232
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,720
I have ran into that.

233
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,720
In fact, I was just talking about in our love plug meeting on Sunday why I had to stop

234
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,000
gaming on Wayland after months of it working.

235
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,840
And that was one of the reasons I ran into an issue like that.

236
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
This is an early thing.

237
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,680
I mean, we're talking about the very first release.

238
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,880
It's basically packaged for arch systems at this point.

239
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,520
It's very early days.

240
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:48,720
But this fork phenomenon is both a bad thing and a good thing.

241
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,120
But I want to talk about why it's a good thing just for a moment.

242
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:58,840
It is a bypass switch that does not exist in other forms of business or software development.

243
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,960
When you in business or in regular commercial software development, when you hit a group

244
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:11,040
of stakeholders who are unwilling to make changes because of justifiable reasons, insert

245
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,440
whatever they might be here, you're dead in the water.

246
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,440
There's nothing you can do about it.

247
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,560
There's no alternative choice.

248
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,640
But with open source and free software, if you get to the point where you feel like the

249
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:28,480
organization is perhaps hampering the future of the actual software development itself,

250
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,860
you can fork it.

251
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,800
There's not copyright law and IP law, I mean, in some cases, but in most genuine free software

252
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,160
project cases, they can't come after you for it.

253
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
Right.

254
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,000
I mean, there's no guarantee that your fork will be popular or anyone will use it, but

255
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,960
you totally have the freedom to go explore.

256
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,560
And sometimes those changes eventually make it back upstream or things re-emerge or you

257
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,400
just end up with two healthy projects.

258
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,160
But think about how empowering that is for software developers.

259
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,120
Because imagine yourself, imagine maybe you have a situation at work or with family or

260
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,500
your church or whatever it is where you've been advocating for something to be done differently,

261
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,000
but for justifiable reasons, quote unquote, nothing's happening.

262
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,320
Nobody will do anything and you're just dead in the water.

263
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,000
You can take no action.

264
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,320
How empowering is it that as a software developer, you can fork in these cases?

265
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,000
And I think we can all think of some very, very, very, very successful forks that have

266
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,880
eventually become the main project long term.

267
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,960
I mean, it also sort of underscores to me that it's not, you know, this isn't the KDE

268
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
projects code.

269
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
It's not some developers code.

270
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
It's everyone's code.

271
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,200
It's free software.

272
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
That's a good point, too.

273
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
It's the people's code, Wes.

274
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,000
I say fork away.

275
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,320
And I'd like to see where this goes.

276
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,820
Maybe eventually some of these things get incorporated back into mainline Kwin.

277
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,820
Who knows, right?

278
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,820
Right.

279
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,280
And it might just be end up as an experimental project to sort of explore the possibilities

280
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,880
for future directions without committing to those changes in the upstream project.

281
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,240
Now, of course, it's not perfect with forks.

282
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,600
There are downsides that we've talked about all the time, including splitting labor and

283
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,680
might just end up with no one using the fork for a lot of wasted effort.

284
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
Right.

285
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,160
It's not a guaranteed thing, is it, Minimac?

286
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,780
Yeah, it's always the same of these forks.

287
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,840
You have to find some other developers supporting you, otherwise it stays a one man show.

288
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,840
Yeah.

289
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
And you got to get users.

290
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,660
It's not a slam dunk.

291
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,100
It's an interesting feature of free software that I don't think is very prevalent in other

292
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,480
software development or even just general business practices.

293
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,480
Certainly fascinating to watch.

294
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
Yeah, it is.

295
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,480
All right.

296
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,980
I want to debate something with you guys.

297
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,620
See what you all think about this.

298
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,000
Are you familiar with Bleach Bit?

299
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,960
That sounds familiar, but no, not really.

300
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,680
Well, I heard the name Bleach Bit.

301
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,660
I was thinking it was like, like DBAN.

302
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,760
You know, somebody went in a white, you know, a hard drive wiper.

303
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,840
Now I remember Bleach Bit is, it's like a, think of it as like a Linux desktop maintenance

304
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
program.

305
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,680
Oh, like something you might use in Windows to clean things up.

306
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,680
Yeah.

307
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
Like CCleaner was.

308
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
Yes, exactly.

309
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,680
Yeah.

310
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Like you would see in Windows.

311
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:56,780
Bleach Bit is a Python application that goes through and cleans out your Firefox, Chrome,

312
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,440
your Opera cache, and it'll go through if you use G Potter and clean up some of the

313
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
old files there.

314
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,360
If you've got some VLC caches that haven't been updated in a long time.

315
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,040
I didn't even know that existed.

316
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,980
It'll do some small fixes too, like fixing some pop-up notification things.

317
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,880
It's all just specific to the Linux desktop and they've added specific support for different

318
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,200
distros to try to accommodate the way they lay things out and whatnot.

319
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,100
And the idea is, is you run Bleach Bit.

320
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,560
It says, all right, I've detected this software on your Linux box.

321
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,000
This is my, this is my recommendation to go clean it up.

322
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,440
You're going to save 2.3 gigs or whatever.

323
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,000
What is your opinion, Wes Payne, on using these kinds of tools on your desktop?

324
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,660
I'm going to go out on a limb and guess you've never run this on your computer.

325
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,660
I have not.

326
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,800
Although I did just install it.

327
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,080
I've never run it either.

328
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,800
I've run CCleaner on Windows boxes before though, so I kind of get the concept.

329
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,520
I also don't think that Linux is immune from needing some kind of maintenance, especially

330
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,360
a box you've been running a while that's collected some files.

331
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,080
I mean, hey, we've all looked under.config and been a little horrified.

332
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
Yeah.

333
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,400
I'm surprised that like things that are still alive in some temp directory years later,

334
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,520
you know, I've definitely done that too.

335
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,300
It does seem a little more difficult on Linux just because there's so much more variation

336
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,240
than on the Windows platform.

337
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,760
But a lot of this stuff is integrating with things like Firefox and Chrome, which I'm

338
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,560
sure are huge offenders.

339
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,880
And those are at least standardized.

340
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,680
In some sense, it might be nice to see because users coming from other platforms who are

341
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,280
not yet familiar with the strange directory layout in our Unix world.

342
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,320
These are hard to find.

343
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,940
You might not know if they're safe to delete.

344
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,060
So if this is the sort of helping hand you need to feel like you can actively maintain

345
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,040
and administer your system, I guess I'm all for it.

346
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,040
What do you think about these types of tools, GZ?

347
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,000
Is Linux too much of a moving target for something like this to work?

348
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That's exactly it.

349
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,760
I mean, personally, I would never use anything like this.

350
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,200
But you know, it does raise a valid point that if you're coming from another operating

351
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,000
system, you might find a tool like this helpful.

352
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,160
But for me, it seems like that the ever evolving state of Linux kind of prohibits this and

353
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,760
you always just end up chasing your own tail.

354
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,800
And the devs just have to keep going back over top of these things.

355
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,640
And here's this latest iteration.

356
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,800
Here's kwin-ft or how do we handle this?

357
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
How do we handle that?

358
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,520
So I think that for me, it's not something I would use.

359
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:18,320
I guess if you feel some sort of, you know, provide you some sort of safety net, use it.

360
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,560
But I would never personally use it.

361
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,700
So Brent, I'm curious to know what you think.

362
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,080
You probably often are managing disk space with lots of photos.

363
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,160
You could probably eke out a few gigs here and there with a tool like this.

364
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,400
Is this something that would appeal to you?

365
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,460
Well, I would say in the past, it felt like, you know, those two point whatever gigs that

366
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,720
you get back felt really important.

367
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,520
But I just feel like these days in the last year or two, maybe three, four, for some of

368
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:48,080
us, hard drive space and solid state space is just so cheap that I don't really think

369
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,080
about that anymore.

370
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,200
Like, it's, of course, with my photos, I end up filling up directories pretty quickly.

371
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,640
But the effort, even with a great tool like this to kind of wrap my head around cleaning

372
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,220
those little files up, it kind of doesn't seem worth the time for me.

373
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,040
So I don't know, maybe that's just me.

374
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,400
Yeah, disks are cheap and there's a ton of space on there.

375
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
What about new users?

376
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Computer kid?

377
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,160
This seems like it could be used for people that haven't really learned the file system

378
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
yet.

379
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:22,440
Yeah, I would say that if we're going to have Linux go mainstream as a like desktop platform,

380
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,800
we're going to need tools like this because for new users, this would be a very nice thing

381
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:35,000
to have, especially new users with Chromebook level ish under storage filled devices.

382
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,480
This would be helpful, but probably not for like production and stuff.

383
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,480
Right.

384
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,480
I could see that.

385
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,640
Colonel, you're not necessarily a new user, but you've used, I believe, Bleachbit in the

386
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,040
past and liked it, right?

387
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,040
Yeah.

388
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,080
So where I've used Bleachbit in the past is it makes it really easy to find caches for

389
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,560
certain programs.

390
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,920
And I've had desktop environments glitch out on me and I've used Bleachbit to go and wipe

391
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,720
its caches and it fixes the problem.

392
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,480
Same thing with a few other programs.

393
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,000
You know, like Cheezy was saying, I think part of the problem here is that Linux is

394
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,680
a big moving target.

395
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,840
And so this application would have to get updated all the time.

396
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,720
However, that's also perhaps an argument for the application because you could then say,

397
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,600
well, Linux is a moving target all the time.

398
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,720
I don't have time to learn where stuff's getting relocated.

399
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,100
So I will just trust that these developers who will probably know more than me will programmatically

400
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,760
solve this for me.

401
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,920
So I could see that as a justification for it too.

402
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,360
It does seem to have some nice safeguards.

403
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,480
Like I was going to select some stuff to clean up Firefox and it warned me that I was about

404
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,320
to delete any saved passwords I have, which I don't manage them that way, but it's good

405
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
to know.

406
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,480
How does this registry cleaning function work?

407
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh man, Windows.

408
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,740
It really seems more necessary on Windows, but a nice to have on Linux, basically.

409
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:55,560
And I do wonder if there isn't maybe two or three or four things it does that are actually

410
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,320
pretty handy that you couldn't then just go do manually.

411
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,320
Well, yeah.

412
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,600
I mean, there's one here like clean up broken desktop files, which I'm not auditing those

413
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
things.

414
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
That's nice to have a tool for.

415
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Yeah.

416
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,720
I've had dead desktop files that just sit around forever.

417
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,740
Why doesn't something check the path of those things?

418
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,000
What an obvious idea.

419
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah.

420
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Okay.

421
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I can kind of see it.

422
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,200
Maybe that's what Fedora needed to do because unfortunately Fedora 32, which I think was

423
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:25,240
going to be releasing today as we record, has been bumped as of right now to the 28th

424
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
of April.

425
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,200
So a week from about now, a week and change.

426
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
We'll find out more.

427
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,460
There's going to be another meeting to sort of talk about if that release date looks plausible

428
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,480
this coming Thursday, the 23rd.

429
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:41,960
If you missed our fun with early out of memory killers, okay, Umar, go check out that episode

430
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,920
of Linux Unplugged because we did play around with one of the more fun features of Fedora

431
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,200
32 and that's going to whet your appetite, I think, for this new release.

432
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Episode 348.

433
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Thank you, Wes.

434
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,440
So you just have to wait a few more days to get Fedora 32.

435
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,860
And we will actually, it kind of works out for your humble Linux talk show because now

436
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,800
we can do Ubuntu this week and we can do Fedora next week.

437
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
A little awkward otherwise.

438
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Yeah.

439
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,440
Fitting two distro reviews in, it's just not really very doable.

440
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
It's a lot.

441
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,120
The target release date now, of course, things can change.

442
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
They will meet together.

443
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,080
They have a, they have a no go, go meeting, kind of like a space launch for an Apollo

444
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,080
rocket.

445
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,080
With similar consequences.

446
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,680
Go, no go flight.

447
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,780
Yeah, very similar.

448
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,240
And then they decide if they're going to release and they'll meet again.

449
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,760
And it looks like the target release date is April 28th.

450
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,360
Carl, did I butcher anything in there that you want to fix before we move on?

451
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,880
Does that sound about all right to you?

452
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
I approve.

453
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Okay, good.

454
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,880
Thank you, sir.

455
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
Woo.

456
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
With no authority.

457
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Yeah.

458
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,960
No, but you're at least closer to the grapevine than I am.

459
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,120
Carl says grapevine.

460
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
You'd probably know.

461
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,120
How about a little housekeeping?

462
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
Yes, please.

463
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
You down for that?

464
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
I'm down for that.

465
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
Yeah.

466
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
There's kind of a smell in here.

467
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
Yeah.

468
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
We needed to get this done.

469
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,000
Go check out Linux Spotlight episode 44.

470
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,880
Our very own Drew DeVore, editor of this year podcast, was featured with Rocco on Linux

471
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
Spotlight.

472
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,020
Drew, you're on the line.

473
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,760
Is there anything you want to tease?

474
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,680
Really, I just want to say thank you to Rocco.

475
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,280
It was a really good interview.

476
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,280
His style is fantastic, very laid back.

477
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,720
And we had a lot of fun talking about really just everything surrounding Linux and the

478
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,840
community and the future of it and really where things stand.

479
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,560
So it was really nice to sit down with him and yeah, go check it out.

480
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,760
I like that.

481
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,440
You can tell, can't you, Drew, when you're working with him that Rocco works really hard

482
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
on Linux Spotlight.

483
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
Oh yeah.

484
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,200
It is a fantastic program and he has put a lot of love into it.

485
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,720
Also longtime community member Tyler Brown was interviewed on episode 43, so you can

486
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,720
go check out that too.

487
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,200
Lots of good stuff in that feed.

488
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Yeah.

489
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Yep.

490
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
So go check out Linux Spotlight.

491
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
We'll have links in the show notes.

492
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,080
And I encourage you to join us live.

493
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,840
We do this here show on Tuesdays at noon Pacific.

494
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,960
Get it converted at your local time at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

495
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:16,280
Also I mentioned it already, but we're doing another get together on Sundays at the same

496
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
live time.

497
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,840
So noon Pacific, but on Sunday we're all jumping in that mumble room, we're having a good time.

498
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,520
I think you and I, we were there for like maybe two and a half hours, two hours.

499
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,080
And it was really just getting started by that point.

500
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
No kidding.

501
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,320
I'm like, I'm going to go eat.

502
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,920
I should have just brought the pizza because the guys just had a great time.

503
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,440
Popey showed up a little bit later.

504
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
Computer kid ended up buying a 3D printer.

505
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
Like the whole thing.

506
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,600
Sounds like it was a lot of fun.

507
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,040
It's a really nice way to sort of break up the Sunday.

508
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,680
Just chat with like-minded folks.

509
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,340
I think if people keep showing up, they're going to keep doing it.

510
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,120
And we're going to make an attempt to show up from time to time, just like I'm sure everybody

511
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
else was.

512
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,720
You know, a Sunday opens up for you, jump on mumble and come hang out.

513
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,580
If you can't make it during the week, it's also a great opportunity.

514
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:03,080
But there's something really nice about having just prolonged conversations with people that

515
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,280
know what the hell you're talking about when you're talking about Linux and things like

516
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,280
that.

517
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,280
A nice, casual atmosphere.

518
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
No pressure.

519
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
Yeah.

520
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
Say what you want.

521
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,520
And if you want to join us in a text conversation throughout the week when the shows are off

522
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,040
the air or send us some quick feedback, check out jupitabroadcasting.com slash telegram.

523
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,360
That is our official telegram channel.

524
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,760
You know, maybe Brent should tell us to a brunch just came out this morning.

525
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
That's right.

526
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,760
Mr. Brent.

527
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,160
The new brunch has landed.

528
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,680
And for those of us that are fans of the gnome persuasion, it's a definite must listen.

529
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,240
Yeah, I had a lovely conversation with Sri Ramakrishna.

530
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,660
He's been part of the gnome community for since 98, which I can't fathom.

531
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:49,920
So we kind of explored his, well, things he's seen since then, little shifts in community,

532
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,120
the different bridges that have been building in the last year and a half between a bunch

533
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
of communities.

534
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,440
It was a really great chat, so I encourage people to check it out.

535
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,520
I love a fresh brunch.

536
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,080
Extras dot show slash 71.

537
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
Thank you cheese.

538
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,360
Yeah, so go check that out.

539
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,920
Also go check out chrislast.com.

540
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,080
I got some projects that I'm working on there and any future projects, you'll probably find

541
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,680
them there at chrislast.com.

542
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,240
If you're ever wondering, hey, where's Chris?

543
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,240
What's he up to?

544
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
chrislast.com.

545
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,240
So go check that out.

546
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,840
The Unfilter show's back.

547
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,640
That's linked over there as well as a few other things.

548
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,820
Check out chrislast.com.

549
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,320
That's my personal site.

550
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:29,000
Also just, I should have mentioned this earlier, that virtual lug meeting on Sunday also has

551
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,440
their own chat room.

552
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,800
It's on geekshed, irc dot geekshed dot net, and it's in pound, lup, lug.

553
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Hey, that's easy.

554
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
Super easy.

555
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Sundays, noon, Pacific.

556
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,160
There's a lot to check out, a lot going on these days, and more down the pipe, so be

557
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,000
sure to check back.

558
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,400
chrislast.com, Linux Unplugged, virtual lug getting together on Sundays, a lot of cool

559
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,440
projects going on right now.

560
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,560
I like that.

561
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,520
The lug's self-organized.

562
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,800
They did this on their own.

563
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,800
Very cool.

564
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Super cool.

565
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,280
And now we just get to show up as members of the community.

566
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,960
We don't have to be the ones that are putting it all together and figuring it all out.

567
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
We just get to be participants.

568
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
It's not about us.

569
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,960
It's a community thing.

570
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
It's very cool for us.

571
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,920
So I'm really glad you guys did that.

572
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
All right.

573
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,520
That's all the housekeeping we have.

574
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,040
You ready to talk a little, Buntu?

575
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Finally.

576
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
Little 20.04.

577
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,960
So we got the focal here.

578
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
I want to say focus.

579
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,880
Is that, why don't I always want to say?

580
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
Focus on focal.

581
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
Why?

582
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
Yeah.

583
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
Let's focus.

584
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,880
Yeah.

585
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
Hey.

586
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
Let's focus on focal real quick, Wes.

587
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,880
What do you say?

588
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,080
Now, what is a fuchsia, Wes?

589
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,720
Do you know what a fuchsia is?

590
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,880
Well, I didn't before, but thankfully we did some research.

591
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,880
Not a lot of people know about the fuchsia.

592
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,800
The fuchsia is the largest carnivore on Madagascar.

593
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,560
A fuchsia is a pretty unique animal.

594
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:52,440
If I had to imagine what the common ancestor between the mongooses, the cats, and the hyenas

595
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,960
looked like, I imagine it would look a lot like a fuchsia.

596
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
You've always said that, right?

597
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
Yeah.

598
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,960
Absolutely.

599
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,160
Turns out Madagascar is a weird place full of strange animals.

600
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,040
So let's talk about a Buntu 20.04.

601
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,800
It is the next long-term support.

602
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,480
It'll be supported for five years.

603
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,120
There's a couple of big headline features with this one.

604
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,120
You're getting baked in ZFS snapshots if you choose that option during the installer.

605
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,280
And you probably should, even if it's experimental.

606
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,280
Yes.

607
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,640
You're getting GNOME 3.36 with the Yaru theme installed by default.

608
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,640
Beautiful.

609
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
Mm-hmm.

610
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,120
As well as kernel, was it 5.5?

611
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,120
5.4.

612
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:36,120
Ah, yes, 5.4, but with WireGuard backported right in.

613
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,480
So let's start here.

614
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,640
Let's start at the ZFS snapshots.

615
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:47,160
Let's just get this out of the way, because I think this is a big part of what is in 20.04,

616
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,280
is the work they've done here.

617
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,680
A lot of, I think, software engineering, a lot of the software engineering that went

618
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,880
into 20.04 was around these ZFS snapshots.

619
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,480
I crave ZFS.

620
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,040
Yeah, I know, Leo.

621
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,760
They integrate in at the grub menu level.

622
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,600
They integrate in at the package or manager level.

623
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,280
So when you're installing a package, they take snapshots and things like that.

624
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:14,680
And I'm very, very happy to report that on several, more than two occasions.

625
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,440
Oh, I don't even know about all these.

626
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:23,640
I used the snapshots to fix something that went wrong on my beta process.

627
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,400
And that does happen when you're using pre-release software.

628
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Absolutely.

629
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,200
And so having these snapshots was very, very useful.

630
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,060
And the way they present themselves is you restart, and the grub menu comes up, and there's

631
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,560
like an advanced option that you go to in the grub menu.

632
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,560
And there you have all of your snapshots listed.

633
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,760
Not super intuitive, not super obvious, like which ones are pre-upgrades or not, because

634
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,000
it's all kind of date and time based.

635
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Right.

636
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,840
So you kind of have to have a sense of when did I last upgrade and when did this break?

637
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,520
Which did actually bite me, because I at one point went back, but I didn't go back far

638
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,520
enough.

639
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,120
And you have two options, essentially, when you go back.

640
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
There's more than that.

641
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,320
There's two options, when you want to restore, you can either go back and just restore the

642
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,480
system state, or you can restore the system state along with user data.

643
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,960
And you were digging into how that actually functionally works.

644
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
Yeah.

645
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
I mean, they've done a lot of interesting work.

646
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,600
There's a whole sort of grub function in there to go find all your snapshots and list it

647
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,940
out.

648
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,880
All that stuff's integrated with the use of their new ZSYS tool.

649
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,880
So anytime you're installing an apt package, that triggers a ZSYS call, ZSYS goes and saves

650
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,120
the system state.

651
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,960
And then if you want to restore user data as well, if it's just the system, you boot

652
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,760
right into that snapshot, right, and it just swaps it out, the magic of ZFS.

653
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,640
And then they've added some hooks so that if you want to do the user data, that just

654
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,480
triggers ZSYS once you've logged in before, you know, as the system is coming up, and

655
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,200
then it'll roll those back too.

656
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:56,160
So ZSYS is a ZFS system tool for targeting a ZFS on Linux experience that right now is

657
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,860
tailored towards Ubuntu, but in theory, any project could modify this, it's open source.

658
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:07,840
It allows running multiple ZFS systems in parallel on the same machine.

659
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
How cool is that?

660
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,340
And the great thing about snapshots, correct me if I'm wrong, great thing about snapshots

661
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,760
is their differentials.

662
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:20,480
You're not bombing your disk, taking up 30 gig snapshots every time you back your system

663
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,480
up.

664
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,760
It's a differential and it's almost like pointers in a file system directory.

665
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,000
Yeah, I mean, that's really the magic of copy on write is that you have all these references

666
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,720
and yes, it still does take up some space and you will need to clean up those snapshots

667
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,600
eventually, but you're not having to make a whole new copy of every single file unless

668
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
it actually changed.

669
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,280
I actually am not totally clear on what the cleanup process is with ZSYS because I've

670
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,520
just not used it long enough to see it auto trim.

671
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,400
And on top of that, I've been rapidly installing updates because of the beta period.

672
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,200
I will also add that the setup is not necessarily simple to make some of this magic work.

673
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,920
You've got a root pool and a boot pool and a whole bunch of data sets underneath each.

674
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:06,040
So if you're not familiar with CFS and you're not willing to maybe go poke around a little,

675
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,240
do consider that this is an advanced experimental feature.

676
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,680
But honestly, so far, I haven't had to.

677
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,400
You almost don't notice it exists besides a couple of messages when you're installing

678
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,620
a package that tell you that it's taking a snapshot and these new grub options.

679
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,120
There's really nothing else you need to worry about.

680
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120
You wouldn't even know you're on CFS.

681
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,800
I think it would be possible to install an Ubuntu system with CFS and give it to an end

682
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,680
user and they would never have any idea unless they really dug around.

683
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,760
A couple of caveats, though.

684
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,460
It requires full disk partitioning.

685
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:41,600
The current implementation, it needs to be set up by the installer to use ZSYS and it

686
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,880
needs to take over your entire disk.

687
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,800
And they have sliced things up considerably.

688
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:51,480
Like they've really kind of sliced things up to manage how it does snapshots.

689
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,160
And it can be a little complicated when you look at it just as a layman.

690
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,160
Yeah.

691
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,960
I mean, there's a lot of different data sets each mounted, right?

692
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,720
So stuff for your home directory, all kinds of different things for the different root

693
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
folders.

694
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,720
And that makes sense.

695
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,160
It gives you more granularity as you're taking these snapshots, so you can actually roll

696
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,960
back what you want and not one big, huge rollback.

697
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
Right.

698
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,600
Like, for example, I can roll back just the system software, but my user home directory,

699
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,520
all my user setting up, app settings, all that remains.

700
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,020
And that's pretty fricking nice, Wes.

701
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,640
That's where I've been really impressed is it's just for being experimental, for being

702
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,640
new.

703
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,920
I mean, ZSYS hasn't been around that long and it's a brand new app written in Go from

704
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,920
Canonical.

705
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,280
It all just sort of works.

706
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,280
Yeah.

707
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:36,000
Now, what about, so like Tyler, you want to use ZFS and you want to use this new ZSYS

708
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,040
system they have on your next server build, right?

709
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,240
I've not looked into the new ZSYS system, but I definitely intend on using a ZFS as

710
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,560
the file system for my server build next month.

711
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,560
Yeah.

712
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,560
Yeah.

713
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,440
I want to see what is now possible.

714
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,360
I think there's a lot of speculation way back in 1604 when we very first had ZFS built into

715
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,360
the kernel.

716
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,360
Were there going to be lawsuits?

717
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
What's going to happen?

718
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,040
Is it just some option for really experienced administrators?

719
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
Right.

720
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,760
Canonical clearly has some long-term plans here and that's awesome.

721
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:10,340
So before we move off ZFS, I got to touch on what I think is the big picture aspect

722
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,860
of this, because it's not just ZFS, it's the snapshots too.

723
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,920
And it's snapshots done in a way that I think are a little bit better than anybody else

724
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,920
has done them before.

725
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,680
Other distributions have had snapshots integrated with their package manager before.

726
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,420
This feels like a more comprehensive solution.

727
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,620
And because of things like ZSYS and the overall approach they're taking and the integration

728
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:35,400
with grub and the package manager, the entire picture, when you zoom out what you get, and

729
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:41,740
you know this is a big deal for me, this is legitimately Canonical's first crack at a

730
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,520
truly bulletproof Linux workstation server.

731
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,520
You're going to say it.

732
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
You knew it.

733
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,520
But you're right.

734
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,520
This matters so much to me.

735
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,600
I want Linux to get to the point where it is absolutely bulletproof.

736
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,600
And that's why projects like Silverblue appeal to me.

737
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,920
And that's why Canonical integrating these snapshots the way they have appealed to me.

738
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:06,640
Because it means as an end user, my first step towards getting a bulletproof Linux distribution

739
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,820
isn't hours and hours of reading Wiki and forms and listening to podcasts.

740
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,240
It's not figuring it out from a technical level and building software.

741
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,240
It's none of that.

742
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,080
I just install the frickin distribution.

743
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,080
Well, it made me think about when we were trying timeshift out on Linux Mint and that

744
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,080
was great.

745
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,540
But you could you could really tell it was sort of bolted on, hacked on at the end.

746
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,540
Don't get me wrong.

747
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,540
I'm grateful it exists.

748
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,320
But this is designing it from the ground up.

749
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,200
By the people that are making the OS.

750
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Right.

751
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,440
And powered by ZFS, which I mean, can you pick a more rock solid file system?

752
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
And it's portable.

753
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,200
You know, I mean, it's true that they're doing the disk layout and all of that.

754
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,920
But at the end of the day, these ZFS snapshots and file systems are portable.

755
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
Right.

756
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,400
And it's got the advantage of things like ZFS send and receive now, too.

757
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:53,280
So I really can't underscore how critically important this is as a first step towards

758
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,760
the Ubuntu desktop becoming bulletproof.

759
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,000
It isn't bulletproof because of this, but man, is this a huge step.

760
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:11,600
I mean, I'm sitting here using my daily driver laptop, my ThinkPad on a beta because of this.

761
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,400
Like I had things blow up.

762
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,680
I will tell you, this was not the smoothest Ubuntu beta I've ever had.

763
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,640
That does seem to be the case, which with a lot of neat new features, you know, there's

764
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,180
a lot of things to tweak before you can get it out the door.

765
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:30,160
And if it wasn't for this recovery system and get right back to work, I would have had

766
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,160
to nuke and pave.

767
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,760
In fact, did you end up having to go back on to plasma?

768
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,620
Yeah, I was planning to do the show on 2004 because why wouldn't I?

769
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,960
But having it lock up right before the show was not very encouraging.

770
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
Yeah.

771
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,960
And that was a flat pack thing.

772
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,200
I mean, it was something we're going to look into after the show.

773
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,920
And if we need to file a bug, we will.

774
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,200
I think it's a double edged sword.

775
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,980
I think what happened was Canonical ran a very successful testing week.

776
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:59,480
At the flip side, that meant that right towards the end, a whole bunch of bug fixes landed,

777
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,720
which is good, but not always the recipe you want for an LTS.

778
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:09,640
So if I was going to run this in production on my server, I might wait until a point release

779
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:15,320
or two for 2004 and I might stick with 1804 on my x86 hardware.

780
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:21,800
That being said, as often happens on this show, I'm not actually doing what I preach.

781
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:29,200
I am running on my Raspberry Pi 4 Ubuntu 2004 and I will not run anything else, at least

782
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
for a while.

783
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,640
I will try other distros soon, but fricking A am I so happy with Ubuntu 2004 on the Raspberry

784
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,640
Pi.

785
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,280
I think Canon said they're going to make the Raspberry Pi platform a first class citizen

786
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,320
for Ubuntu.

787
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,320
They weren't kidding.

788
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,320
Big deal.

789
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:51,360
2004 on the Raspberry Pi 4 with 4 gigs of RAM in 64 bit mode is the best experience

790
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,920
I have ever had, even compared to Raspbian, on a Raspberry Pi.

791
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,780
And they've fixed some things that have yet to be fixed in the Raspbian kernel that have

792
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,840
landed in the 2004 kernel.

793
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,980
So for the Raspberry Pi platform, I'm immediately switching to 2004.

794
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:10,440
That said, on the x86 server side, I think I'm going to wait a little bit because of

795
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,460
some of these issues I had during the beta and release candidate period that I think

796
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:20,360
suggest if you can, give it a few weeks, maybe a couple of months.

797
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,840
That's kind of the nice part about a new LTS too.

798
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,880
There's no rush to use this.

799
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,160
It's going to be around for a while.

800
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
Right.

801
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,160
And 1804 is still getting updates.

802
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,160
Still great.

803
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,160
Still great.

804
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:34,520
So let's talk about some of the flavors here because as always, there's a lot to talk about

805
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,560
in the different flavors when you add it all up.

806
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:42,640
Of course, Kubuntu 2004 is seeing Plasma 5.18 land, which is nice.

807
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,600
That includes things like the new emoji selector, which I admit I actually like.

808
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:54,200
But more importantly, in my daily use, I've noticed a much improved GTK theming support.

809
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
Oh, definitely.

810
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
A lot nicer.

811
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,400
A lot nicer.

812
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,480
And there's better options for toggling notifications, which are, for me, probably the bane of the

813
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,680
the largest source of annoyance.

814
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,200
And now that both Plasma and Gnome have decent notification management, quality of life has

815
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,960
actually gone up on this one.

816
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,440
And of course, there's a Ubuntu Budgie 2004 seeing their typical release.

817
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,440
Yeah, with a brand new application menu inspired by Slingshot.

818
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,440
Yeah.

819
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,900
There's also a new native network manager applet for managing wired and Wi-Fi connections.

820
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,080
That's nice to see.

821
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,280
Are you ready for the big feature in Ubuntu 2004?

822
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,280
Oh, boy.

823
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,280
I mean, it's got to be big, right?

824
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,080
Come on, XFCE, they're making changes all the time.

825
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:41,200
Ladies and gentlemen, after years of development, tons of anticipation, I am happy to report

826
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:51,520
that Ubuntu 2004 features a brand new dark theme.

827
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:58,800
You know, I'm surprised you're not more excited considering you are a dark theme kind of guy.

828
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,360
I know, I know, but like, that's just not the kind of thing that's going to get me excited

829
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,400
because I can just I was already that was like, within 30 seconds of using Ubuntu, I

830
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
would change that.

831
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400
It is nice to see it bundled in.

832
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,960
See, but you got to you got to switch your mindset here.

833
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,120
The advantage is there's not too many things change.

834
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,240
So you can just roll on to the next Ubuntu without having to deal with all these interface

835
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,240
changes.

836
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,160
Suddenly your apps don't work the same way while getting all the underlying 2004 stuff.

837
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,160
That's it right there.

838
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,160
And that's the point I was going to make.

839
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:32,000
I was poking fun, but the reality is, is if they just keep the lights on and they rev

840
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,280
everything and they just ship a 2004 ISO, they inherit all the improvements of 2004.

841
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,000
So like job done, you know, they don't need to do much more.

842
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Rock salad.

843
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Yeah.

844
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Yeah.

845
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,440
And of course, Ubuntu Mate sees its update with this one.

846
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,200
It's going to get all of the new Mate 1.2.4 features, of course, you're going to see better

847
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,360
high DPI rendering throughout the entire UI, lots of nice notification improvements there

848
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
as well.

849
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:03,340
But, and I thought this was a mistake at first when I was going through the 2004 Mate edition,

850
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,000
but then I confirmed it with Wimpy.

851
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,520
They've removed Compass.

852
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,520
It's gone.

853
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,520
It's gone.

854
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,520
Wow.

855
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,520
Yeah.

856
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:15,040
At the same time, the Marko window manager has seen significant, they are really working

857
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,040
on improvements.

858
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,040
Yeah.

859
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,040
Big time.

860
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,040
Lots of gaming stuff is in there.

861
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,040
So just kind of makes sense.

862
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,040
It would land in the LTS release.

863
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,040
Right.

864
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,320
It's going to be the new GTK front end for the FWAPD application.

865
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
What?

866
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,320
Yeah.

867
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,320
FWAPD.

868
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,080
But I just love seeing these GUIs for the firmware updates.

869
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,160
It just makes Linux feel so first class, like a real system where you can actually manage

870
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,680
the full life cycle of whatever machine you're on.

871
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,680
Finally.

872
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,680
Yeah.

873
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,680
Yeah.

874
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,680
Yeah, absolutely.

875
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,000
So, Lubuntu, this is a big deal for them.

876
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,640
This is their first LTS release using LXQT.

877
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,880
So that's a big deal.

878
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
And then...

879
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,880
Wow.

880
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,440
They've made a bunch of changes, a new menu.

881
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,520
So those are both two that you need to take a look at.

882
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,880
I do think Lubuntu, this was also...

883
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,360
They're pushing on to 64-bit.

884
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:05,800
So I don't believe there are any 32-bit builds of Lubuntu of 2004 either.

885
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,800
What a heck of a time.

886
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,180
32-bit is gone now.

887
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,320
It's a great time to be a Linux user.

888
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,320
It is though.

889
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:16,760
Now, Drew, you may have noticed that Ubuntu Studio has landed with improved Ubuntu Studio

890
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,760
controls.

891
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,760
Can you tell us what this is and why it kind of matters?

892
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,720
With Ubuntu Studio, you use something called Jack for your audio server.

893
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,600
And Ubuntu Studio controls is essentially an easy mode for setting up Jack.

894
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,200
At least that's the way I look at it.

895
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:38,080
So it lets you control various aspects of how this Jack server runs so that you can

896
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:44,360
get the lowest latency possible without having to do nearly as much fiddling in the backend.

897
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,560
It just makes it super easy.

898
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,000
You know, the number one problem with Jack is people getting started with it, so something

899
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
like that's really nice.

900
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,480
Yeah, and most people don't really want to load PulseAudio modules from the command line,

901
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,560
so a GUI makes things a lot simpler.

902
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,560
They don't?

903
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,960
Well, I do, but you certainly don't.

904
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:06,200
No, in fact, thankfully, you can because Wes has scripted a whole bunch of stuff for us

905
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,200
in the studio.

906
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,360
So you do load it from the command line, but I never have to bother with it.

907
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:14,680
However, keep that in mind when we get to our app pick later, which is a command line

908
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,640
audio utility, which I picked.

909
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,640
What is happening?

910
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,640
You know what?

911
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,640
Every now and then there's room for it.

912
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,960
Also, something to consider with 2004 is this is a distribution now that ships in a post-spectre,

913
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
post-meltdown world.

914
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,960
Right.

915
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,880
And I think it's worth talking about what that means for us as end users.

916
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,800
There is some performance impacts because of this, and it's the new normal now.

917
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,600
And so Michael Larable over at Ferronix did, as you would expect, a comprehensive benchmark

918
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:46,800
of the impact that the out-of-the-box protections against Spectre, Meltdown, and its friends

919
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,800
— that's a good way to put it — are, how they impact the 2004 default release.

920
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,480
And it turns out there's a kernel command line just called mitigations equal off.

921
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,280
If you just want to turn all these off, maybe not advisable, but it's definitely doable.

922
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,080
But he ran it through 2004 through a series of real-world tests on a bunch of different

923
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:11,500
Xeon CPUs, as well as an AMD EPYC CPU.

924
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,760
And the results are not what I expected.

925
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:22,000
In some instances, and I repeat, some instances, in some of those, the mitigation version actually

926
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
pulled ahead.

927
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Weird.

928
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Yeah, in most it didn't.

929
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Sure.

930
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Right.

931
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,060
But in some it did.

932
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:34,060
And when you look at the benchmarks, he did 42 different average server workload benchmarks

933
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,120
just for server workloads.

934
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,620
He did 42 different benchmarks.

935
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:43,460
And he found that on the Xeon E5 Haswell and the Kaby Lake Xeons, on average, you're getting

936
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,840
about a 12% hit to your performance on Ubuntu 2004.

937
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,460
It's going to be the same for all Linuxes, right?

938
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,680
On the EPYC Roam server, it was more like a 5% impact.

939
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,160
Hey, that's not so bad.

940
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,160
Right.

941
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,840
That's almost noise at that level, which is really nice to see this, right?

942
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,440
You know, there's probably tons of places, especially if you're not running a server

943
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,680
or anything, where, yeah, you could safely or relatively safely disable these.

944
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,240
You know, you could turn the mitigations off if you wanted to.

945
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,360
But if that's the only difference, just don't bother.

946
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,080
Yeah, it might be worth it, especially on the EPYC CPU.

947
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,080
Right.

948
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:18,380
You know, on the Intel CPU Xeons, he tried a couple of different Xeons.

949
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,600
It varies more.

950
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,200
I guess the word there would be it's just worth running your own benchmarks.

951
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,200
And it's pretty easy with the Ferronix Test Suite.

952
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,880
You could just actually run the exact benchmarks Michael runs because of the comparison feature

953
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,440
and see how your system fares.

954
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,760
You know, in Ferronix Test Suite news, I was happy to see that they've now got a WireGuard

955
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,000
network, which you could use because, of course, WireGuard is included in 20.04.

956
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,400
Let's talk about the 20.04 kernel.

957
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,400
It's a special kernel.

958
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:49,200
It's version 5.4, and it might be worth recapping what landed in 5.4 because it's just now going

959
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,200
to hit users.

960
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,680
Yeah, well, you get that original exFAT driver, if you remember, the first one based on some

961
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,320
old Samsung code.

962
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,920
You'll have to wait for kernel 5.7 to get the new updated one.

963
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,920
But hey, that's there.

964
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,920
It's probably good for read-only, though.

965
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,920
Yeah, right.

966
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,120
I mean, at least you can read stuff.

967
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:09,280
You'll be pleased to know faster at large directory modifications on exFAT, as well

968
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,320
as a new read-only file system that Huawei uses on their devices.

969
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,440
So lots of file system love this time around.

970
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,260
Plus, of course, better support for AMD hardware.

971
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:22,520
If you're not familiar, IO U-Ring is a new kernel feature for doing fast, asynchronous

972
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,520
IO.

973
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,540
And 5.4 ships with a lot of good improvements there.

974
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:30,960
And just outside, we've seen that really getting picked up for people that need really good

975
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,960
disk performance.

976
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,840
And there hasn't been a great option on Linux before.

977
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:39,320
And as you know, IO load on the Linux kernel, that can do some nasty things to your desktop.

978
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,880
Yeah, yeah, that's very true.

979
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:47,560
I also recall that one of the really big headline features of 5.4 is one of the security features

980
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,320
that I believe Canonical's touting to the server customers, and that's kernel lockdown

981
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,320
mode.

982
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,320
Lockdown!

983
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,960
Intended to strengthen the boundary between root and the kernel.

984
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,540
Once you've enabled it, various pieces of kernel functionality are restricted.

985
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,820
So it could break some stuff, you're going to want to test this before you use it.

986
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:07,120
But it helps keep things secure, especially maybe you're in a secure boot environment,

987
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,120
you've got some certain controls or, you know, auditing that you need to do, and you have

988
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:13,960
to make sure that the kernel is not just letting anybody load modules and all kinds of things.

989
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,960
Lockdown mode will help you.

990
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,160
Yeah, it's fascinating because it started trying to address something that secure boot

991
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,360
offers, which secure boot almost feels like it's a dirty word for us to use these days.

992
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,040
But it's so much more than that.

993
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,840
What it developed into was a lot more than that.

994
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:32,280
It started trying to ensure the basic protections of secure boot and developed into something

995
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,440
a lot more.

996
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,840
It's also nice because a lot of distributions had their own out-of-tree patches for this.

997
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,080
And so now we can standardize all of that with the in-kernel version.

998
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,600
Right, just normalize now.

999
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
That's also really good to see.

1000
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:47,760
So it reduces the differences between Linux kernels and Linux distros.

1001
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,040
We've talked a lot about 5.6 recently and 5.7 because of WireGuard and things like that.

1002
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,880
5.4 was actually a pretty great release, too.

1003
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,040
Yeah, the last thing I'd like to touch on is the Vert.io file system, lots of file system

1004
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,040
stuff there.

1005
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,920
That's a Fuse framework-based file system that's designed to speed up copying things

1006
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,280
in and out of your QEMU guests, which, hey, that's pretty great.

1007
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,420
You will need a newer version of QEMU to get the support on the QEMU side, of course.

1008
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:14,960
But it's way faster than using, say, like the Plan 9 file system that lots of folks

1009
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,960
are using.

1010
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,760
And that's just great because virtual machines, Linux virtualization capabilities, top notch.

1011
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,760
Yeah.

1012
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,000
I'll put a link in the show notes.

1013
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:30,200
I did a visual comparison of GNOME 3.4 to GNOME 3.6.

1014
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,800
It's not huge.

1015
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,080
It's a quality of life improvement between GNOME 3.4 and GNOME 3.6.

1016
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:42,000
The menus are better, it's faster, tons of bug fixes, tons of GPU fixes.

1017
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,080
Take a look at the link I have in the show notes to Imgur, where I took two VMs and I

1018
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:53,640
just did two stock Ubuntu VMs side by side on my 27-inch screen and then just did A-B

1019
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,720
comparisons and did screenshots of that.

1020
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,000
And I have an Imgur album of that.

1021
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,080
And what you'll see in there is refinements to the main function menu for a log out and

1022
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:13,580
log in, incredible improvements to GNOME system settings, and a significantly nicer lock screen

1023
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,580
and log ins.

1024
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:17,120
Man, it's really first class now.

1025
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,960
Very pro looking, better than anything on the Mac or Windows.

1026
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:25,040
I mean, the new GNOME lock screen and log in screen are quite choice and they're just

1027
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,000
worth checking out the screenshots alone.

1028
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,560
On everything else we've just talked about, you've got this new GNOME release, which in

1029
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:40,060
my personal opinion, having some experience with GNOME over the last decade, I would say

1030
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:45,160
this is far and above the best release of GNOME Shell ever.

1031
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,880
This might be the best GNOME desktop and I'm even including the two version series with

1032
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,880
that.

1033
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,120
This might, 3.6 might be the best.

1034
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,320
It just feels so fast and rock solid and smooth.

1035
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:58,340
I mean, we were talking about this before the show, as much as we love Plasma, going

1036
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:03,200
back and forth between Plasma, even the latest version here on Neon and the latest GNOME,

1037
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,200
you feel the difference.

1038
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,200
Yes.

1039
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,320
I mean, like I said, I was doing an A, B side by side and I could tell just totally stock

1040
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,600
both of them.

1041
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,600
I could tell the difference.

1042
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,800
I think it shows, you know, to the GNOME team's credit that a lot of work has gone into the

1043
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,040
underpinnings there to just smooth everything out.

1044
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,040
Yeah.

1045
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,200
And there's been some good work by Canonical in that regard.

1046
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,240
There's been good work by just people, like you say, on the GNOME team.

1047
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,240
Let's go around the horn.

1048
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,320
So MiniMech, I'm curious to know what your experiences with 2004 and your testing were,

1049
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,920
if they were all that dramatic or not.

1050
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:37,160
One thing is that Ubuntu with the new LibSSL version they used in 2004, they deprecate

1051
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,580
some encryption models.

1052
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:43,680
So you have TLS 1.0 and 1.1 that are deprecated.

1053
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:49,120
So if all of a sudden you can't connect to your server anymore, you know where the problem

1054
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,120
lies.

1055
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,120
Oh, that's a good tip.

1056
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,740
We had that in Mumble.

1057
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:58,680
So our Mumble server was TLS 1.0, and all of a sudden I had problems to log in to the

1058
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,200
Jupyter broadcasting Mumble server.

1059
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:06,200
In fact, I'm very, very grateful that you guys got all that resolved before 2004 actually

1060
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,200
landed.

1061
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,200
No kidding.

1062
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:14,040
Tyler is pointing out in the chat room that we've missed probably one of the more obvious

1063
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,280
and important things about the GNOME setup with 2004.

1064
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,280
Yes.

1065
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:24,340
The new Yaru theme is absolutely gorgeous, especially the dark variant and the new icon

1066
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:28,200
set in 2004, it is also gorgeous.

1067
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:32,200
It's so nice that I'm installing it on every distro I use.

1068
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,200
Even if it's not Ubuntu.

1069
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,160
If I'm on Manjaro, I'm installing Yaru.

1070
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,520
It helps that I love me some purple.

1071
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,580
Also, and this is in my visual comparison, something that Canonical has added is a super

1072
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:47,300
simple appearance pane, I think is what you call it, in the GNOME system settings that

1073
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,440
just lets you toggle between light and dark mode.

1074
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,440
Just boop.

1075
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,520
Another one of those things that instead of going into some hacky sub menu to change these

1076
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,880
sort of unofficial settings.

1077
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,680
Or maybe even knowing that like in the past, you'd probably have to install GNOME tweaks.

1078
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,680
Right, right.

1079
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,840
Now it's just right there in the settings where it should be.

1080
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,840
Yeah.

1081
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,840
Yeah, that is really cool.

1082
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,840
And it looks good.

1083
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,800
And it's really easy to turn on, which I appreciate and it's really easy to turn off as well.

1084
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,320
Same with night shift, very easy to turn it off.

1085
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:17,760
There is potentially a bumpy road for a set of users that we don't directly address right

1086
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,480
now in this show, but is going to be a growing part of the Ubuntu base.

1087
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,180
And that's the WSL users, the people that are using Ubuntu on the Windows subsystem

1088
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,360
for Linux.

1089
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:37,080
And it seems as of now, until patches come down for Windows, the WSL 1 version 1 and

1090
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,120
Ubuntu 20.04 may have some compatibility issues.

1091
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:46,720
And this is actually pretty well documented and outlined on the Ubuntu discourse that

1092
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,720
you can read.

1093
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,720
We'll have a link to it.

1094
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,720
It appears that there is some problem with WSL 1.

1095
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,360
There's a patch for it, but it appears to be like a GLib issue.

1096
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,360
Well, right.

1097
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:02,980
So 20.04 has a new version of GLib C 2.31, and that's implemented a new nano sleep library

1098
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,480
call based on clock real time.

1099
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:10,200
Unfortunately, as you recall, WSL 1, while very technically cool, is basically a shim

1100
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,140
layer that takes all these Linux kernel sys calls and has to go translate those down to

1101
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:19,360
Windows sys calls and unfortunately, emulating Unix style system clocks on an NT kernel.

1102
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,160
Well, to say it politely, that's tricky.

1103
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:27,840
That's why WSL 2, which is using a regular Linux kernel in a full on VM here, doesn't

1104
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,880
have the same problem.

1105
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,600
So if you're on WSL 2, no problems at all.

1106
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,600
Just give it a try.

1107
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,600
You can use 20.04 whenever you like.

1108
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,080
WSL 1, you'll have to wait for that patch to come down in a future update.

1109
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,080
Yeah.

1110
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,920
And it's a little complicated because WSL 2 isn't technically available to everybody.

1111
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,920
Right.

1112
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,080
So you're going to have to go through some hoops to get the insider builds to get that.

1113
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:51,120
And WSL 1 has some advantages over WSL 2.

1114
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:56,720
And WSL 1 is essentially less resource intensive because you're not emulating an entire system.

1115
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,420
You don't have this little VM going, yeah.

1116
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:04,280
So canonical estimates that people will probably continue to use WSL 1 even after WSL 2 has

1117
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,280
shipped.

1118
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,280
So I will say some credit should go here to the Windows team because despite clearly working

1119
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,020
on this, you know, this whole new version of it, they're still doing patches and fixing

1120
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,600
for these things for WSL 1.

1121
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,600
So be aware if you're on Windows.

1122
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:20,180
If you're a Windows user who uses the Windows subsystem for Linux and that's why you listen

1123
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,320
to this podcast, let us know.

1124
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,280
I'm wondering how many are out there these days and if they're searching out Linux content.

1125
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,840
You know, I also have to say that Hayden Barnes has been doing a great job communicating some

1126
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,840
of this stuff.

1127
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,840
That's how I found out about this.

1128
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,840
Right.

1129
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,760
There's a great telegram group you might want to go join for chatting about all things WSL.

1130
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,240
And we'll link to the Discord thread where they're talking about it too in discourse.

1131
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:44,720
Also kind of fun is a game mode, which is that Feral Interactive tool to optimize your

1132
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,200
Linux box for gaming will be default in 2004.

1133
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,480
Which is nice because in the beta period I had some hard times initially was not able

1134
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,480
to get it working.

1135
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,160
And troubleshooting is the last thing you want to do when you're already late for playing

1136
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,400
a game or you just want to relax.

1137
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,220
You're not trying to do any work on your system.

1138
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,220
You just want to have fun.

1139
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,680
I like how you phrase that because that is so like when you're quote unquote late for

1140
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,680
playing a game.

1141
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:06,680
That's me.

1142
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,120
How do you show up late playing video?

1143
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,120
But I do.

1144
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,000
I'm like, oh man, I was supposed to start gaming 10 minutes ago.

1145
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I don't got time for this.

1146
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,400
I got a half hour window.

1147
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,940
It's hard to find time when you got a busy day and you just want to get right to it.

1148
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:22,280
So Cheezy, I know you had a chance to kick the tires.

1149
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,600
You had a few experiences too.

1150
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:28,120
I'd love to hear what you, what your overall takeaway was 2004 and any snags you hit.

1151
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:32,420
You know, a lot of you guys have already mentioned the new themings.

1152
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:33,420
They're really polished.

1153
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,160
So the new dark theme is super nice.

1154
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:39,000
I also really like the standard theme because it's kind of a blend between the dark and

1155
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,760
the light modes.

1156
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:47,000
The new icon set is again, super nice and it works well in both dark and light themes.

1157
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,480
And as someone who knows a thing or two about designs, that might be saying something.

1158
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,480
Yeah.

1159
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,120
I mean, I highly encourage you to check it out if you have it because it's just, it's

1160
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,120
beautiful there.

1161
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:00,940
And you can tell that they're kind of incrementally polishing every little bit.

1162
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:06,960
So Chris, you had mentioned like the login screen, it's super clean, it's super nice.

1163
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,720
It's not very distracting.

1164
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:15,340
To me, just with the new gnome, it seems a little bit snappier than old 3.4.

1165
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:19,360
So all around, I mean, visually, I think it's a really great system.

1166
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:25,200
There are a couple of things in your Imgur album, which we'll link in the show notes.

1167
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,360
You know, there are a couple of things that did kind of annoy me when it comes to the

1168
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:35,740
design, which is they've changed the Nautilus icon now to be instead of kind of a file cabinet

1169
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,280
look to a file folder.

1170
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:43,360
But they put this kind of weird border around it, which none of the other icons have in

1171
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,360
the set.

1172
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,360
Yeah.

1173
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,360
You know, I noticed that too.

1174
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,480
It doesn't look great, unfortunately.

1175
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,720
The new toggles, they've gone from the green to using this purple accent that Ubuntu is

1176
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,240
kind of famous for, I really like that.

1177
00:55:55,240 --> 00:56:01,120
The fractional scaling, while I think it was baked in, is a lot nicer, in my opinion.

1178
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:06,400
They've even tweaked the store so that now they have the editor's picks and then the

1179
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:12,200
categories below that, so it looks a little less busy and a little less hectic.

1180
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,880
You know, you can just get in and search for what you need and get out.

1181
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:20,160
A couple of questionable things I had was whenever you launch Nautilus for the first

1182
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,840
time and pretty much every distro is like this, they give me the icon view or the grid

1183
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:25,840
view.

1184
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:30,520
I'm one of those guys that always, always uses the detailed list view.

1185
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,520
Thank you.

1186
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,120
And why can't we set that as a default, please?

1187
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:38,240
What kind of monster wants these giant icons where they can only fit half of their directory

1188
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,760
content on the screen?

1189
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,820
And you can't even read the file name, really, right?

1190
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:45,840
Because it's all kind of truncated and stacked instead of just a horizontal line of text.

1191
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,720
And then how do you even sort by date modified?

1192
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,040
Which is the first thing I want to do.

1193
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,000
It's monstrous.

1194
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,760
They've also baked in a cool little to-do app, and I've noticed this on a few of the

1195
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:01,040
apps that they've baked in, but there's no hover over tooltips on some of these.

1196
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:05,060
So you just have to guess that this icon is supposed to represent a checklist and this

1197
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,060
one's supposed to...

1198
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,200
It sounds small, but that really hurts the accessibility.

1199
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,520
You're taking a designer's eye at this, though.

1200
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,520
I appreciate that.

1201
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,280
Well, I mean, that's just how I see it, right?

1202
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:17,000
So I have to just take it based upon face value as I kind of read the layout and everything.

1203
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,120
I mean, I think it's great, and I think that they're heading in the right direction.

1204
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:25,120
And these are all like little minuscule tweaks that I don't think most people would even

1205
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,400
really notice.

1206
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,900
It's not in the final release, but you did end up hitting kind of a gnarly beta bug that

1207
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,520
we also saw, but I don't think struggled with as much as you did.

1208
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,520
Yeah.

1209
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:39,380
So I'm using this ThinkPad 440S, and I've got two disks in it.

1210
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:47,680
I've got one in the M.2 slot where the 3G radio modem used to live, and then one just

1211
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,480
an SSD hooked up as well.

1212
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:57,080
So on the SSD, I have Manjaro, and then on the M.2, I use basically whatever.

1213
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:01,720
So that's kind of my drive to jump around on.

1214
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:10,680
I noticed whenever I installed Ubuntu and Mate that there was a grub boot menu bug.

1215
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:17,160
So once installed, whenever you would reboot the machine, they're using the new EFI fast

1216
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:23,960
boot kind of system that the Lenovo logo would pop up, then it would pop up with a nice Ubuntu

1217
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,120
logo below that, load Ubuntu directly to the login screen.

1218
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,120
Which looks pretty nice.

1219
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,120
It really does.

1220
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,120
Yeah.

1221
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:36,280
I think it's a step up for sure, but wouldn't allow me to get into the actual grub boot

1222
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,280
menu.

1223
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,280
Oh.

1224
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:44,760
Of course, you can hit F12, and then just because it's in the bios there that you can

1225
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,560
just hit F12 and then boot into Manjaro.

1226
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,520
So I mean, I still had access to that drive.

1227
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:53,320
It wasn't something that just stopped me in my tracks, but being a Linux user, it kind

1228
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,320
of drove me nuts.

1229
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,320
Where's my grub at?

1230
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,320
Yeah, exactly.

1231
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:02,720
So I went through all sorts of leaps and bounds, and Bill helped me out, kind of directed me

1232
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,960
like, hey, maybe try this, try that.

1233
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,760
And come to find out after doing a little bit of research, there was actually a bug

1234
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,720
out there already for it.

1235
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:14,240
And so looking back, it looks like it's something that's being worked through.

1236
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,800
You also had that same thing I had going up from grub to the actual desktop UI, where

1237
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:24,000
when you search in Gnome Shell, some of the labels or the text of icons gets cut off or

1238
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,060
the bottom portion of the icons gets cut off.

1239
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,060
You hit that too, right?

1240
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,060
Right.

1241
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:33,320
So if you open up the applications menu and you scroll down to any folder, and I think

1242
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,200
this is really just a Gnome Shell issue that's being worked on.

1243
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,560
If you create folders, which is a nice feature so you can kind of bundle apps together, the

1244
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:48,040
last line of icons in that folder, and I haven't determined how many icons you have to have

1245
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:52,640
in the folder for this to happen or anything, but my example was the utilities folder in

1246
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,320
the Gnome Shell menu.

1247
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:59,360
If you click on that and scroll all the way down, the last line of text below the icons

1248
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,480
was cut off.

1249
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,800
However, if you launched one of those apps down there, it's the terminal.

1250
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,080
That's the first thing, generally always open.

1251
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:10,000
If you click on the terminal, load the terminal, then go back to the Gnome Shell menu and scroll

1252
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,840
down, you should be able to see that last line of text.

1253
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:13,840
Really?

1254
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,840
Weird.

1255
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,840
All right.

1256
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,600
This is something I'm going to play with more, and I might see if there's a bug for it because

1257
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,320
that seems a little strange.

1258
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:25,960
Once they get a few of these little bugs worked out with the grub version, maybe a point release

1259
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:30,800
for Gnome Shell or something like that, it's going to be one of the best Linux distributions

1260
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,480
out there, especially for the desktop.

1261
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,480
I completely agree.

1262
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,480
Well said.

1263
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,480
It is already very, very, very close, and within a point update, I think it's going

1264
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,320
to be really, really in a good spot.

1265
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,480
I am thrilled with this release.

1266
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,240
I'm really, really thrilled with the performance.

1267
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,840
You guys know I'm always the guy that's on here saying, it's not fast enough.

1268
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:49,840
It's not fast enough.

1269
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,360
It just needs to be snappier.

1270
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,960
Well, they did it.

1271
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,880
I hate to say it like this, but if you're someone like me who's always felt like the

1272
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,600
interface wasn't snappy enough, the way I can put it to you is this.

1273
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:07,800
Ubuntu 2004 with Gnome 3.36 is finally as fast as it always should have been.

1274
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:13,560
If you've spent real money on your PC, if you're a guy like me who has four or five

1275
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,560
dedicated...

1276
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:19,280
I put my home on its own disk, I put root on its own disk, I put var on its own disk,

1277
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,200
I put all of my editing scratch on its own disk, I've got 64 gigabytes of RAM, I've

1278
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,160
got 12 cores in this thing.

1279
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:33,940
My main system, it's a rockstar, and it should be so fast that I never have complaints with

1280
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:34,940
its speed.

1281
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:35,940
Right?

1282
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:36,940
You shouldn't be waiting around for just about anything.

1283
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:37,940
Never.

1284
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:44,320
And so it finally feels like Ubuntu 2004 with Gnome 3.36 is as fast as it always should

1285
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,600
have been.

1286
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:50,360
That is not a backhanded compliment because software, it just takes a while to get there.

1287
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:55,440
And not very often do you get new versions of software and things get faster.

1288
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,960
So this is a compliment I'm making.

1289
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:57,960
Right.

1290
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,600
And I mean, you know, graphics compositing, that's a hard thing.

1291
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,600
Right.

1292
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:06,120
And so the fact that years now into it, you can install something and it feels faster.

1293
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,280
In fact, I'd say it feels like I'm getting the actual metal performance out of my machine

1294
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,560
now.

1295
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,560
And that is so nice that it just so, so, so nice because I feel like I'm finally getting

1296
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,740
my money's worth out of out of some of this stuff.

1297
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:19,920
And so I am thrilled with the release.

1298
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:25,400
Now we got a question from Daniel that came in on Twitter and he said, I'm migrating to

1299
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,500
an LTS very soon.

1300
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:33,160
Would it be the best case to go with 1804 now or would I be better off going with 2004

1301
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,160
so I don't have to touch it later?

1302
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,440
This came in on Twitter.

1303
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:41,160
And I think the answer to that is it depends on your threshold.

1304
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:46,680
For a server, I might stick with 1804 for now.

1305
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,240
But for the desktop, I think you're good to go.

1306
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:53,480
I think that the the final fixes that have landed, it's really hard for me to say at

1307
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,900
this point, I need like another four weeks with it.

1308
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:01,080
But the last few days, it really seems like a lot of stuff has come together.

1309
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:05,480
And I think on the desktop, if you have a threshold of a little tiny bit of things not

1310
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:09,200
working here and there, if you can, if you can tolerate that, I think it's a go.

1311
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:14,240
On the server, on the x86 side, like I said earlier, I think maybe wait a bit.

1312
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,120
And on the ARM side, I think it's a go.

1313
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:19,680
So it's a complicated question to answer, Dan, so I'm sorry, I don't have a better answer

1314
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,680
for you.

1315
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,160
But it's sort of one of those, it depends, right?

1316
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,160
Yeah, right.

1317
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,160
I mean, you got to tolerate your own risk.

1318
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,140
And also, how comfortable are you upgrading down the line, you know, that process has

1319
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:30,080
gotten a lot better over the years, but isn't totally risk free.

1320
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,360
And I'll add this too.

1321
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,720
I don't know if the desktop question is fully answered yet.

1322
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,440
We're going to look at Fedora 32, possibly next week.

1323
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,240
And we may have a different answer for you.

1324
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:45,120
What's great is a lot of the improvements you're getting with GNOME 3.6 will land in

1325
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,660
both of these distributions.

1326
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:51,600
And so a lot of what we've talked about here will apply to Fedora 32 as well.

1327
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,320
But they have done some extra special sauce there.

1328
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:58,040
They've implemented that early out of memory killer by default.

1329
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:01,420
That's something that Ubuntu 24 does not have right now.

1330
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:04,200
And so there's some special sauce there.

1331
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,800
And I don't know which one yet is necessarily the better desktop workstation.

1332
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,680
We just get spoiled for options.

1333
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,360
It's a good problem to have.

1334
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:15,200
So Dan, let us know what you end up doing, what LTS release you decide to go with 18.04

1335
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,200
or 20.04.

1336
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,040
And let us know how it goes.

1337
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:21,960
I know a lot of people have asked us in the in the lug meeting that we did on Sunday,

1338
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,000
are you guys going to put 20.04 on your arch box?

1339
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Not yet.

1340
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,600
I mean, we've already got arch, how much more do you need?

1341
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,640
I was thinking we do this Wes, what do you think of this?

1342
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:36,240
Let's try putting that arch box on the arch LTS kernel.

1343
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:40,080
And if that goes bad, then maybe we consider going to 20.04.

1344
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,680
All right, it's worth a shot.

1345
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,800
I know what you're thinking like, Chris, that's a lot of work.

1346
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:45,800
That's a lot of work.

1347
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,240
But remember, we separated out the data.

1348
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,320
So if we have to replace the OS, we'll be fine.

1349
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,320
We'll be okay.

1350
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,320
We'll be okay.

1351
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,320
Yeah.

1352
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,320
So we'll let you know how that goes.

1353
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,280
But man, is it nice to see this release.

1354
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,360
These LTS is there something special as as Linux users, we get something kind of special

1355
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,360
every five years.

1356
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:01,360
I know, right.

1357
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,040
And there's this certain excitement around the LTS sort of seen what the shape of the

1358
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,940
future is going to be.

1359
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:09,600
And it's nice for this little window doesn't last for the entire time, although that's

1360
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,100
getting better with things like snaps and flatbacks.

1361
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:13,960
Everything in the repo is just fresh.

1362
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,960
You know, that's worth talking about just for a second.

1363
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,560
So you get a new LTS every now and then and then they're supported for five years and

1364
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,560
it's kind of special.

1365
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:31,600
It almost could do an 1804 review of how usable is it now at the release of the next LTS?

1366
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,140
How usable still today is 1804?

1367
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:38,800
Because that wasn't always the case when I think it was Minimax and he was still on 1604.

1368
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,000
You're like, holy crap, that's so old.

1369
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Maybe we could try that, too.

1370
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
You know, we'll split it up a bit.

1371
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Yeah.

1372
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,360
I don't know if I have that sense with 1804.

1373
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:50,760
I wonder if we could we should take a look at it and try to make an 1804 workstation

1374
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,000
that's totally up to date, modern, and ready to go.

1375
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:59,800
The thing is, now that you have snap packages and flatback and everything, so 1604 was really

1376
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:04,160
a crucial release for that because you got snap packages and flatback integrated.

1377
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:12,000
So it was easy for software that you wanted to keep in the newest state, you were able

1378
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,840
to have these packages or you had PPAs.

1379
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:22,760
So for me, using enlightenment, so not the stock GNOME desktop environment, it was easy

1380
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:23,760
to live with that.

1381
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,760
No problem.

1382
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,960
If you're not trying to use GNOME Shell, I bet it is.

1383
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:27,960
Yeah.

1384
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,700
What do you say before we get out of here?

1385
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:30,700
We do a couple of picks.

1386
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,700
Oh, let's do it.

1387
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:36,120
I teased a command line audio application that I like a lot.

1388
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,920
There'll be a few things that come out of me relaunching on filter.

1389
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:46,440
And that is essentially me trying to come up with a reproducible media workflow to edit

1390
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,120
and grab clips and all of that kind of stuff.

1391
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:52,720
And the net result here on the show will be cool tools that you get to hear about.

1392
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:56,920
And PA Cat, Pulse Audio Cat is one of them.

1393
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:02,480
You can play back or record raw audio streams right out of Pulse Audio.

1394
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,800
You don't have to pull up VLC or MPV or any of these tools, you can just do it right from

1395
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:06,800
the command line.

1396
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,960
PA Cat will essentially treat audio like it's a text file.

1397
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,240
And it's a simple tool for playing back or capturing raw encoded audio files from the

1398
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,040
Pulse Audio sound server.

1399
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,860
It understands anything that Pulse understands.

1400
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:20,860
So that's everything.

1401
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:22,300
It's everything.

1402
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:27,640
And it all is supported by anything that the lib sound file library supports, PA Cat will

1403
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,640
support.

1404
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:31,680
And, you know, there's some YouTube stream I'm watching and all of a sudden like, I want

1405
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,680
to hear this.

1406
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,680
I want to record this.

1407
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,680
I want to clip this.

1408
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,680
You can use this tool.

1409
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,680
Right.

1410
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,520
Especially you just add a little easy bash alias or something.

1411
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:41,980
It has a ton of options for choosing maybe even have multiple Pulse servers.

1412
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:45,080
You can specify what sort of format you want to capture it in.

1413
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,080
That's great.

1414
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:50,600
You also helped me recently with an FFmpeg script that's crazy simple.

1415
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:54,840
You just say FFmpeg record and then you give it an interface number.

1416
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,640
And then it just starts recording.

1417
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:00,740
This is such a great way to record application audio on your Linux box.

1418
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:03,460
There's lots of ways you can record microphone audio and all that.

1419
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:07,160
But maybe you're just listening to something on your Linux box and you want to record that

1420
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,160
application.

1421
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,160
Yeah.

1422
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,160
Watching a live stream or something.

1423
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,160
Yeah.

1424
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,160
Or music or whatever.

1425
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:16,680
So if you take like a file that is maybe a Spotify playlist and it's all one file, it's

1426
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,880
one flack, FFmpeg will do it.

1427
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,400
And it will, you just have to give it the device name or number actually.

1428
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,600
And there's, do you remember the command?

1429
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,600
Was it?

1430
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,600
Oh yeah.

1431
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,600
P-A-C-T-L.

1432
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,600
And then you can just do a list command.

1433
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,600
Right.

1434
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,600
It'll show you all your devices.

1435
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,600
P-A-C-T-L list.

1436
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,240
And it will show you all the devices that it detects.

1437
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:35,080
You give it the number and then FFmpeg can just record right from that.

1438
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,600
And man, if I'm not using the heck out of that.

1439
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:43,200
So you combine that with P-A-C-T and it's really powerful.

1440
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:47,560
The Mac has graphical applications from Rogue Amoeba to do all this kind of stuff, but it's

1441
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,740
all there on Linux.

1442
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:51,320
You just have to have access to it.

1443
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:55,960
Two months ago I did like this month on the Mac and then we did an episode about it and

1444
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:59,640
I was talking to Wes and I said, you know, one of the things they've really nailed is

1445
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,560
you can just hit a button and start recording application audio.

1446
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,960
And so you and I were looking at ways of doing this under Linux and together we found these

1447
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,080
couple of tools and it's better than anything you do on the Mac.

1448
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,080
Right.

1449
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,080
You just have to know the commands.

1450
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,080
Right.

1451
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,080
And you can add some stuff.

1452
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,640
Pulse actually has some virtual devices you can add.

1453
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,400
I've been playing around with this a little bit myself.

1454
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,160
So if you want to get complicated with it, you can, or you can just use a simple tool

1455
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,160
right from the command line.

1456
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,160
Yeah.

1457
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,160
It's pretty nice.

1458
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,440
We give Pulse a hard time.

1459
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:29,280
You know, it's sort of like it's a meme to give Pulse a hard time, but it is extremely

1460
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:32,440
powerful and it really has a lot of features.

1461
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:36,360
Now that's my pick, but Mr. Bacon comes in with three mucks.

1462
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,360
Tell me about three mucks.

1463
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:42,240
Well, actually this was dropped by Mr. Noble Pain.

1464
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:47,120
He had dropped it in the Slack and he was going to let you own it.

1465
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,760
He was going to let me give you all the credit and let you talk about it and he wasn't going

1466
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:51,760
to argue at all.

1467
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,040
Well, she seemed excited about it.

1468
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,360
You're such a good co-host, Wes.

1469
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:00,320
It's like a Tmux clone written in Golang, right Wes, I believe.

1470
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,520
Yes it is.

1471
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:06,320
Some nice sane i3 key bindings, scroll back.

1472
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,320
Awesome.

1473
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,320
That was the big one for me, right?

1474
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:12,160
Like Tmux, unless you do some configuring, you just don't, your mouse wheel doesn't deal

1475
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,680
what you think it does.

1476
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,360
So I like the description here in the readme.

1477
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,260
Imagine Tmux with a smaller learning curve and more sane defaults.

1478
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:21,040
And I think that that really sums it up.

1479
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,720
You know, there are some Tmux bindings in there still.

1480
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:29,880
So splitting windows, moving panes, those sorts of things are still available as Tmux

1481
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:36,280
bindings, but you know, they have a lot of sane like alt-enter or alt-end will create

1482
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,360
a new pane.

1483
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:43,120
So it's a great looking little multiplexer that I would like to actually get into and

1484
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,240
download and try out.

1485
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,920
I just remember seeing it, seeing you drop it in there.

1486
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:47,920
So I was like, well, you know what?

1487
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,840
I'm going to throw that in for an app pick because it looks super cool.

1488
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:51,840
I will note it is early days.

1489
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,520
It doesn't look like they have any packaged releases just yet.

1490
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:57,120
So you'll have to have go and be able to pull it down that way.

1491
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,780
How did you find this?

1492
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:01,880
14 months ago, the project was started.

1493
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,720
But actually, I'm not joking when I say this.

1494
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:08,880
All of the work seems like it happened in the last, I don't know, six days or so.

1495
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,880
Yeah.

1496
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,200
I mean, it seems to be a project that's picking up steam.

1497
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,200
Good catch, Wes.

1498
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,200
Yeah.

1499
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,820
It's called 3Mux, the number three mux.

1500
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:20,240
And it is a terminal multiplexer that is essentially inspired by i3.

1501
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:22,480
And that is a that is so much genius.

1502
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,480
I can't even with that.

1503
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:24,480
Right.

1504
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,040
I mean, it's sort of a proven paradigm that really works, especially when you have a complicated

1505
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,040
workflow.

1506
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,400
I mean, that's the perfect place to help you manage that stuff.

1507
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,400
Absolutely.

1508
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,400
There you go.

1509
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,560
We'll have links to all of that in the old show notes.

1510
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,920
Linux Unplugged dot com slash 350.

1511
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:38,920
Go check that out.

1512
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,760
Also, I'd love to hear your experiences with the Ubuntu 2004.

1513
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:48,480
Let us know in the telegram group Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash telegram or even better.

1514
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:52,720
Come hang out on that virtual lug day, Sunday, 12 Pacific.

1515
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,960
Join us in that virtual lug in the mumble room and let us know what your experiences

1516
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,920
have been with the flavors or with the main Ubuntu release.

1517
01:11:58,920 --> 01:11:59,920
We love that.

1518
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,040
And it really helps us calibrate our opinions about everything.

1519
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,000
Yeah, it's a it's a great experience.

1520
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
All right, everybody.

1521
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,840
Well, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of the unplugged program.

1522
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:34,800
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1523
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:49,680
I love that the top title, which is not what we're going with, but the top title is get

1524
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,680
forked.

1525
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,680
Carole Baskin.

1526
01:12:51,680 --> 01:13:11,640
That's great, guys.
