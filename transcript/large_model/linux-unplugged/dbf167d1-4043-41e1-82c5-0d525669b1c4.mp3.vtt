WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Congratulations!

00:02.000 --> 00:04.240
A big congratulations to the Linux Foundation.

00:04.240 --> 00:06.080
They announced a game engine today.

00:06.080 --> 00:07.220
Did you see this, Wes?

00:07.220 --> 00:07.720
I did.

00:07.720 --> 00:08.720
Very exciting.

00:08.720 --> 00:11.240
Apparently donated from AWS.

00:11.240 --> 00:13.800
Oh, very great.

00:13.800 --> 00:17.820
There's no version for Linux, though.

00:17.820 --> 00:18.320
Not yet.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.560
I mean, they're working on it.

00:19.560 --> 00:20.640
Of course.

00:20.640 --> 00:23.160
I mean, at this point, it's kind of the corporate friendly

00:23.160 --> 00:24.360
software foundation, right?

00:24.360 --> 00:34.200
Oh, hey, friends.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.080
Welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:36.080 --> 00:36.880
My name is Chris.

00:36.880 --> 00:37.920
My name is Wes.

00:37.920 --> 00:38.880
Hello, Wes.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.200
Is that a cheese steak you've got there?

00:41.200 --> 00:42.840
Unfortunately, none for you.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.160
No, no.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.680
I thought we'd talked about this.

00:45.680 --> 00:46.720
Well, this episode is brought to you

00:46.720 --> 00:47.760
by the all-new Cloud Guru.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.480
They are the leader in learning for the Cloud

00:49.480 --> 00:50.880
Linux and other model tech skills.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.360
Hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

00:53.360 --> 00:57.840
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

00:57.840 --> 01:01.480
Well, coming up on the show today, we all know it's true.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.720
We hate to admit it, but the Linux server

01:03.720 --> 01:04.840
is what makes the money.

01:04.840 --> 01:06.320
It's not the desktop.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.900
In fact, it's where all the corporate sponsored,

01:08.900 --> 01:11.920
for the most part, nearly all corporate sponsored development

01:11.920 --> 01:13.440
time goes.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.080
But there has been a change and something we've

01:15.080 --> 01:16.680
covered on the show before.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.760
And Linux server admins don't really

01:18.760 --> 01:21.400
know where to turn next, especially those that got

01:21.400 --> 01:24.400
themselves all caught up in the Red Hat ecosystem.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.200
They are stuck between some hard choices.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.400
And if you go by apparent community size,

01:29.400 --> 01:32.880
Rocky Linux has a lot of momentum at this time.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.400
But this choice is a critical one,

01:34.400 --> 01:37.360
and we thought we needed to consider the entire picture.

01:37.360 --> 01:41.160
So last week, we ran a new segment on the show

01:41.160 --> 01:43.600
that we actually cut.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.440
And we cut it for completion's sake

01:45.440 --> 01:48.560
because we decided we wanted to play it in today's episode.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.320
And it provoked a strong discussion

01:50.320 --> 01:52.360
after the show that took place after we

01:52.360 --> 01:54.080
stopped the official recording.

01:54.080 --> 01:58.600
And we thought we should take both the new segment

01:58.600 --> 02:00.320
and the response to that new segment

02:00.320 --> 02:02.680
and play it in one single episode for you.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.840
This week, we're going to play that cut information,

02:04.840 --> 02:07.040
that cut story, and that response.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.640
And we hope that after this episode,

02:09.640 --> 02:12.440
you're going to look at the Linux server landscape, which

02:12.440 --> 02:16.040
is exceedingly important for something that we all love.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.200
We hope you're going to look at it a little differently.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.360
Even if you're not an admin yourself

02:19.360 --> 02:21.640
or in the Red Hat ecosystem, I think

02:21.640 --> 02:24.400
there's some questions that get posed that we should all

02:24.400 --> 02:26.120
listen to and all consider and stuff

02:26.120 --> 02:28.640
that those of us who've been using Linux for a long time

02:28.640 --> 02:31.400
know at our core is probably extremely critical.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.940
So we're going to get to all of that.

02:32.940 --> 02:34.240
We're going to have some community news.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.640
But first, we have to say time-appropriate greetings

02:36.640 --> 02:37.720
to our virtual lug.

02:37.720 --> 02:38.760
Hello, Mumble Room.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.920
Hello, Mumble Room.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.040
Whoa.

02:43.040 --> 02:44.440
There's a lot of you in there.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.200
Great to see all of you.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.640
Thank you so much for making it.

02:47.640 --> 02:48.760
Shout out to Poppy and Wimpy.

02:48.760 --> 02:49.640
We haven't seen you for a while.

02:49.640 --> 02:50.840
Welcome back, gentlemen.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.000
Nice to be here again.

02:52.000 --> 02:52.960
Absolutely.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.440
And we hope that you're having an excellent day

02:56.440 --> 02:57.800
and had a great weekend.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.760
I set off for a little adventure this weekend.

03:00.760 --> 03:02.840
And I have some good news and some bad news.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.160
It's going to be another little quick story time

03:05.160 --> 03:06.320
before we get into the show.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.520
Stay a while and listen.

03:08.520 --> 03:11.920
So I decided to spend the 4th of July out in the woods,

03:11.920 --> 03:14.000
let Levi kind of get away from the fireworks

03:14.000 --> 03:16.840
because the little pup doesn't really like all the explosion.

03:16.840 --> 03:20.080
And well, I'll tell you the bad news first.

03:20.080 --> 03:23.880
The wife lady and I were heading off, going to go get set up.

03:23.880 --> 03:26.600
And we kind of just, even though we know better,

03:26.600 --> 03:28.960
even though we're not noobs anymore,

03:28.960 --> 03:30.760
we made some critical mistakes.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.040
And as we were leaving from our home base,

03:33.040 --> 03:35.400
we kind of were in a rush and didn't pay attention

03:35.400 --> 03:38.360
to a couple of things.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.960
And like a good boy, I thought I had everything figured out.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.400
I knew I was in a rush, and I knew I was in a time crunch.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.880
So I went around, and I tried to make sure everything

03:45.880 --> 03:46.520
was all put away.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.320
I collected all my tech gadgets and put them

03:48.320 --> 03:50.920
in a little basket and made sure everything that was stowed

03:50.920 --> 03:51.640
need to be stowed.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.640
And I thought, OK, I was doing everything.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.440
And my wife, Adia, she's in a car behind me.

03:55.440 --> 03:58.040
I'm going down the road in Lady Joops in the RV.

03:58.040 --> 04:00.720
And I'm thinking, this is going to be a great trip

04:00.720 --> 04:03.160
because we're going to test some stuff for the road trip

04:03.160 --> 04:06.040
to Salt Lake City in Denver, get an idea how the power

04:06.040 --> 04:08.480
system is still holding up after a year or so,

04:08.480 --> 04:11.080
really put everything through its paces.

04:11.080 --> 04:14.040
And I'm about 25 minutes or so into the drive,

04:14.040 --> 04:17.600
and I'm pulling off the highway into a gas station.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.680
And I hear a rush of water behind me.

04:19.680 --> 04:23.040
And I turn around, and I find an indoor tidal wave

04:23.040 --> 04:25.840
rushing down the center of Lady Joops,

04:25.840 --> 04:28.720
like a wave of water coming at me.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.960
Thankfully, I was already pulling off the highway

04:30.960 --> 04:32.600
because I had to jump into action.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.000
So I pull off.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.160
I park the RV immediately.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.840
There's nearly standing water in the RV at this point,

04:38.840 --> 04:42.880
total worst case danger zone for RVs.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.840
So I was rushing into the back.

04:44.840 --> 04:48.600
I can almost instinctively figure out what's happened.

04:48.600 --> 04:49.720
I think I already know.

04:49.720 --> 04:54.520
And as I'm getting back there, I hear the bzzz, bzzz, bzzz,

04:54.520 --> 04:59.360
which is our water pump as it's pumping away and pumping away.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.360
I open the back door.

05:00.360 --> 05:01.560
It's kind of like this one move.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.000
I open my back door, and I flip off

05:03.000 --> 05:04.960
the water pump, which should have been off,

05:04.960 --> 05:06.720
a critical mistake.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.160
My eyes knew exactly where to go.

05:08.160 --> 05:11.680
I look right at the sink that I'd put my tech basket in that

05:11.680 --> 05:12.800
had all my gadgets.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.760
Every charger I have, every brick, a game controller

05:15.760 --> 05:18.400
we have, a tablet, everything.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.440
Just put it all in this basket, and everything

05:20.440 --> 05:23.280
was floating in a bath of water because the water had been

05:23.280 --> 05:24.560
pouring right into this basket.

05:24.560 --> 05:29.680
And I look up, and my old 2013 MacBook Pro

05:29.680 --> 05:31.360
had slid across the counter.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.960
It runs Arch, by the way, and hit the water handle

05:34.960 --> 05:36.520
and turned the water on.

05:36.520 --> 05:40.400
And it's a heavy old laptop, a big, old MacBook

05:40.400 --> 05:42.400
from the older days when they were thick and heavy.

05:42.400 --> 05:46.360
And it slid off and hit the handle in just a way

05:46.360 --> 05:48.120
that it managed to turn it on.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.720
And it must have been going for almost 15 minutes

05:50.720 --> 05:54.400
because we managed to pump somewhere between 15 and 20

05:54.400 --> 05:57.760
gallons of water into the RV.

05:57.760 --> 06:00.200
I mean, first it filled the basket.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.480
Then it filled the sink.

06:01.480 --> 06:05.040
And then it just started overflowing and overflowing.

06:05.040 --> 06:07.800
And we spent about an hour trying to get all that dried up.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.680
And man, all of the gadgets are pretty much wrecked.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.760
In like one fell swoop, I basically

06:12.760 --> 06:17.160
took out nearly every gadget I own, not my phone,

06:17.160 --> 06:18.320
not my ThinkPad.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.200
But everything else essentially got

06:20.200 --> 06:22.680
wiped out in this one moment.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.960
It's like your own water-based EMP device, betrayed

06:25.960 --> 06:27.560
by your own MacBook, no less.

06:27.560 --> 06:28.600
This is horrible.

06:28.600 --> 06:32.520
My old trusty 20th, you know, the one I walk, the one I'm like,

06:32.520 --> 06:33.960
this is how they used to build them,

06:33.960 --> 06:36.120
with a good keyboard and ports.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.520
And it runs Linux.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.360
And now that bastard, it wrecked everything.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.040
And of course, it's still good to go.

06:42.040 --> 06:42.960
Oh, it survived?

06:42.960 --> 06:43.840
No way.

06:43.840 --> 06:44.600
Yeah, it survived.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.160
Yeah, it got a little bit of water on the screen.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.040
But I let it dry, and it's working just fine.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.320
I can't believe it.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.840
Five days later, everything in the RV seems OK.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.040
We got it pretty dry.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.800
Thankfully, we were already pulling over.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.800
And my wife was in the RV with me

06:57.800 --> 06:59.840
within minutes, getting everything wiped down

06:59.840 --> 07:00.760
and all of that.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.680
So wow.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.640
But just to have like, you know, like I had a fire tablet

07:05.640 --> 07:07.360
that I had been carrying around because I use it

07:07.360 --> 07:08.080
for Home Assistant.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.680
And I was walking around, turning off things,

07:09.680 --> 07:10.640
and setting automations.

07:10.640 --> 07:11.920
And I set it in the basket.

07:11.920 --> 07:14.160
So this guy just didn't want it to be loose.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.600
Gone.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.480
Wasted.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.160
All of it.

07:17.160 --> 07:18.360
Just wasted.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.360
So that's how I started my 4th of July weekend.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.560
But I do have some good news.

07:22.560 --> 07:23.920
Good news, everyone.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.840
While my slide issues are not fixed yet,

07:25.840 --> 07:28.720
and I was hoping to get them fixed before the Denver trip,

07:28.720 --> 07:31.600
thanks to Virtual Lug member Kernel's help right there,

07:31.600 --> 07:33.600
he turned me on to the Vroom system.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.960
And I've contacted the creator of the Vroom slide system,

07:36.960 --> 07:40.400
who is an RVer, like me, who had the same slide system I do.

07:40.400 --> 07:41.840
And it broke on his first trip.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.240
And he's a mechanical engineer.

07:43.240 --> 07:44.960
And he just said, screw it, I'm going to build a better system.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.120
And now he has.

07:46.120 --> 07:48.760
I don't know if very many people have ever installed these

07:48.760 --> 07:49.000
before.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.120
It looks pretty new.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.640
So I'm kind of rolling the dice here.

07:51.640 --> 07:54.200
But I'm hoping it's going to be like the final solution.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.840
But the issue is, you know, with the way the timing worked out

07:56.840 --> 07:58.240
with the upcoming road trip, we're

07:58.240 --> 07:59.960
not going to get in there until after the road trip.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.400
So that means all through Salt Lake City and Denver.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.000
And until September, we're not going to have a living room.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.160
But the road show will go on.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.280
And we'll still have a great time.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.640
We'll still make content from the road.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.880
It'll just be a little more cramped.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.720
You want to come and stay in there, right, Wes?

08:12.720 --> 08:13.480
Of course.

08:13.480 --> 08:16.480
While you're beta testing a new slide system, no problem.

08:16.480 --> 08:17.560
Bring the dogs, too, Wes.

08:17.560 --> 08:20.600
We'll just have a big old sleepover.

08:20.600 --> 08:21.640
So yeah, there you go.

08:21.640 --> 08:22.600
That's what's going on.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.140
People have been asking for an update.

08:24.140 --> 08:26.040
I wasn't really going to cover much.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.320
But that's some progress, at least.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.480
I want to get to the community news this week.

08:30.480 --> 08:34.200
And let's start with IBM's president and former Red Hat

08:34.200 --> 08:36.720
boss, Jim Whitehurst, stepping down.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.680
Just about three years on the nose

08:38.680 --> 08:42.120
since the announcement of the IBM acquisition.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.840
And that president position at IBM

08:44.840 --> 08:47.200
is the classical position someone takes in the company

08:47.200 --> 08:49.520
before they become CEO.

08:49.520 --> 08:53.280
So a lot of us expected Whitehurst was in line

08:53.280 --> 08:54.040
to be CEO.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.240
In fact, the board had arranged it

08:56.240 --> 08:57.440
so he would become president.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.280
So it kind of seemed like the board was preparing

09:00.280 --> 09:04.200
for Whitehurst while there was an interim CEO.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.800
And Wall Street seemed to like this idea as well,

09:06.800 --> 09:09.040
because when the news was announced on a Friday,

09:09.040 --> 09:11.680
IBM stock dropped 4%.

09:11.680 --> 09:15.280
But now IBM's chief and interim CEO

09:15.280 --> 09:18.760
is apparently becoming the permanent CEO.

09:18.760 --> 09:25.480
Avid Krishna has managed to work at IBM since 1990, 31 years.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.160
How about that?

09:26.160 --> 09:27.320
Old-timer, yeah.

09:27.320 --> 09:28.160
Yeah.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.080
And it's kind of wild.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.240
The Financial Times, which sometimes has a paywall,

09:32.240 --> 09:34.640
depending on how many times you've clicked a link,

09:34.640 --> 09:37.640
but they have an interview with Krishna that is, wow,

09:37.640 --> 09:39.160
is this telling.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.200
He was going to be the transitional exec,

09:41.200 --> 09:44.240
but then it seems, with this Financial Times interview,

09:44.240 --> 09:45.760
we'll have a link to that, it seems

09:45.760 --> 09:47.760
like maybe he worked with the board

09:47.760 --> 09:50.440
to work Whitehurst out and become the new CEO.

09:50.440 --> 09:55.120
And there's some quotes in here that are remarkable.

09:55.120 --> 09:58.240
And the article says that IBM is now doubling down

09:58.240 --> 10:00.920
on IBM's current path under Krishna's leadership.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.960
Quote, this is Krishna.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.640
He's done amazing for us, but he wasn't

10:04.640 --> 10:06.080
going to be here forever.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.600
Speaking in the interview with Financial Times, he added,

10:08.600 --> 10:12.480
acquired CEOs normally only last a year or two.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.760
And then he went on to suggest that,

10:14.760 --> 10:17.760
while he had been in the running to succeed him,

10:17.760 --> 10:20.560
any hope of that had been dashed as the company's board has now

10:20.560 --> 10:23.980
backed him in the next stage of IBM's overhaul.

10:23.980 --> 10:25.520
And then he points in the interview

10:25.520 --> 10:27.520
to the fact that the board had named him as chair

10:27.520 --> 10:29.960
of executive earlier in the year as a sign of that

10:29.960 --> 10:32.400
was backing him, and that the shakeup now

10:32.400 --> 10:36.400
is about building a leadership team to take IBM where

10:36.400 --> 10:38.040
I'm leading it, he says.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.580
He's got an idea, he's got a vision,

10:39.580 --> 10:40.700
and it wasn't Whitehurst.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.960
It's his vision, and it's all about the cloud.

10:42.960 --> 10:45.400
This Financial Times interview basically

10:45.400 --> 10:48.000
makes it sound like Krishna worked Whitehurst out.

10:48.000 --> 10:48.800
It does, doesn't it?

10:48.800 --> 10:49.960
I mean, it's quite telling.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.120
And especially when you think of Krishna

10:52.120 --> 10:54.280
being one of the people internally who was pushing

10:54.280 --> 10:57.040
for the Red Hat acquisition, you got to wonder,

10:57.040 --> 10:59.680
maybe this was part of his personal plan for a long time,

10:59.680 --> 11:01.880
and it seems to be working out for him, at least.

11:01.880 --> 11:03.580
Yeah, everybody always says that Krishna

11:03.580 --> 11:06.560
was the one that was pushing the CEO at the time

11:06.560 --> 11:07.920
for the Red Hat acquisition.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.280
But if you've ever worked in a big company,

11:10.280 --> 11:12.680
you know what I'm about to say rings true.

11:12.680 --> 11:15.800
Big companies are really good at grabbing

11:15.800 --> 11:18.360
on to a narrative that's out there right now

11:18.360 --> 11:21.480
and spinning it to make the new leadership seem competent.

11:21.480 --> 11:24.740
And so the Red Hat acquisition was still fresh.

11:24.740 --> 11:28.160
It was still new when he was the new interim CEO.

11:28.160 --> 11:33.200
And it just seems natural to me that a 110-year-old company

11:33.200 --> 11:36.520
that knows how to message would latch onto a narrative

11:36.520 --> 11:38.920
like that and use it to promote the new boss,

11:38.920 --> 11:41.200
regardless of how true it may or may not be.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.020
So I don't put a lot of stock in the idea

11:43.020 --> 11:45.800
that Krishna was the man behind the merger.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.860
It's definitely possible, but I feel

11:47.860 --> 11:50.800
like that's gotten a life of its own that I don't completely

11:50.800 --> 11:51.740
agree with.

11:51.740 --> 11:53.120
I'd like to see some proof of it,

11:53.120 --> 11:55.320
because what I've seen here is a 30-year-long company

11:55.320 --> 11:57.960
man who is well-liked and has done good in the cloud

11:57.960 --> 11:58.760
division.

11:58.760 --> 12:02.480
But he seems very much like a traditionalist in this space.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.080
The Mayor, I know you want to jump in.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.200
I want to give you a chance to sound off.

12:06.200 --> 12:09.280
I helped Jim Whitehurst when he transitioned

12:09.280 --> 12:11.080
into CEO at Red Hat.

12:11.080 --> 12:13.480
And one thing, one time I was traveling with him,

12:13.480 --> 12:15.640
and one thing that he told me was,

12:15.640 --> 12:17.840
and I think this is kind of the same thing that's

12:17.840 --> 12:18.480
going on here.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.880
When he was at Delta, he sort of thought

12:20.880 --> 12:24.080
that he was in line to be the next CEO as well.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.360
And then once it became abundantly clear

12:26.360 --> 12:29.560
that they weren't going to tap him for that,

12:29.560 --> 12:30.800
he was basically out.

12:30.800 --> 12:34.640
And he's a very ambitious guy, and he has his vision,

12:34.640 --> 12:36.600
and he has his leadership style.

12:36.600 --> 12:42.200
And I think that he just doesn't want to be in any other position

12:42.200 --> 12:43.200
aside from the top.

12:43.200 --> 12:46.800
So I think that's pretty much what happened here exactly

12:46.800 --> 12:47.640
again.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.240
Yeah, and it's telling that it's three years on the nose, which

12:50.240 --> 12:52.040
maybe suggests there was some deal in place.

12:52.040 --> 12:53.600
And when that had wrapped up, and he

12:53.600 --> 12:56.520
wasn't going to get the job he wanted, he decided to leave.

12:56.520 --> 12:59.080
And I think that the mayor, thank you for that insight.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.600
He's, if you don't know, because it

13:00.600 --> 13:01.920
was cut from last week's episode,

13:01.920 --> 13:03.640
but it'll be in this week's episode,

13:03.640 --> 13:06.000
the mayor is the community manager over at Alma Linux.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.760
And so he has some insight into this world.

13:07.760 --> 13:12.800
And when Jim was at Red Hat, after the acquisition,

13:12.800 --> 13:14.840
a lot of us in the community thought, OK, well,

13:14.840 --> 13:16.480
he's kind of like a firewall.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.560
Between a 110-year-old company and a young,

13:19.560 --> 13:22.560
modern Red Hat that has to be super flexible.

13:22.560 --> 13:25.080
And I worry that with Whitehurst gone,

13:25.080 --> 13:28.800
that leadership firewall that defends the culture of Red Hat

13:28.800 --> 13:30.040
is also gone.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.880
And I think that the traditional model of IBM

13:32.880 --> 13:35.480
is not compatible with the innovative model

13:35.480 --> 13:36.920
that Red Hat has to use.

13:36.920 --> 13:39.600
And I grabbed a couple of clips of Whitehurst from a TED Talk,

13:39.600 --> 13:42.480
just a couple of short clips, we'll link the full talk,

13:42.480 --> 13:46.040
that really encapsulate what I'm talking about here.

13:46.040 --> 13:49.240
And this is a clip of Jim Whitehurst explaining

13:49.240 --> 13:52.840
the culture shock that he felt just a couple of weeks

13:52.840 --> 13:56.200
after he left Delta and switched to Red Hat.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.800
It was not like any other traditional large company

13:59.800 --> 14:01.040
he'd ever been at.

14:01.040 --> 14:06.000
I began to realize something significant was happening

14:06.000 --> 14:08.880
my second week on the job at Red Hat.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.960
I was in a meeting talking to the team about our strategy

14:11.960 --> 14:14.320
for an area called virtualization.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.920
For those of you who aren't in technology,

14:15.920 --> 14:18.080
virtualization was the thing everybody

14:18.080 --> 14:21.240
was talking about before they were talking about the cloud.

14:21.240 --> 14:23.320
And through this, I had the senior team

14:23.320 --> 14:24.920
and a bunch of the engineers kind of walking

14:24.920 --> 14:27.160
through our strategy and the what's and the whys of it.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.040
And about halfway through the meeting,

14:29.040 --> 14:32.160
one of the engineers, one of the most junior engineers,

14:32.160 --> 14:33.560
just took a pause and said,

14:33.560 --> 14:35.600
look, I know this is what we're doing,

14:35.600 --> 14:38.560
but this is absolutely the wrong direction.

14:38.560 --> 14:39.720
And he didn't stop there.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.760
He kept going and going and going

14:41.760 --> 14:44.520
about why we were wrong and how wrong we were.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.560
And I'm looking across the room

14:47.560 --> 14:49.760
because this room had his boss and his boss's boss

14:49.760 --> 14:52.920
and his boss's boss's boss waiting for a reaction.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.200
And there was a reaction,

14:55.200 --> 14:56.960
I would call it a point and counterpoint,

14:56.960 --> 14:59.760
which is a very polite way to say we had a huge argument.

15:00.680 --> 15:01.920
But at the end of the meeting,

15:01.920 --> 15:04.640
everybody walked out like this was normal.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.840
Now, I'm two weeks out of being

15:06.840 --> 15:09.080
in a very traditional organization.

15:09.080 --> 15:11.520
And I have to tell you, I was sitting here thinking

15:11.520 --> 15:14.640
this is the most bizarre thing that I had ever seen.

15:14.640 --> 15:18.120
I would hazard at Delta and frankly most large organizations

15:18.120 --> 15:20.200
and many of you know what I mean here,

15:20.200 --> 15:23.680
if a person to the CEO in front of their boss,

15:23.680 --> 15:26.800
their boss's boss and their boss's boss's boss said

15:26.800 --> 15:29.000
what these people are doing is completely wrong,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.160
that person would have clearly been fired

15:31.160 --> 15:32.360
by the end of the day.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.920
And to be honest, maybe killed before the end of the meeting.

15:34.920 --> 15:39.520
But everybody acted like this was normal.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.840
And I remember going home that night and talking to my wife

15:41.840 --> 15:44.600
and I said, I have come into this most bizarre,

15:44.600 --> 15:46.000
strange company.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.240
I've clearly been brought in to clean it up.

15:49.480 --> 15:52.760
And it wasn't just this, a couple of weeks later,

15:52.760 --> 15:55.640
I asked about doing a research report in an area.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.560
And a couple of weeks later, when I asked about

15:57.560 --> 16:01.000
where that was, the team very happily and merrily said,

16:01.000 --> 16:02.200
yeah, we thought it was a bad idea.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.640
So we decided not to do that.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.160
So first I really like, what's like,

16:07.160 --> 16:08.400
do I have like a mutiny on my tab?

16:08.400 --> 16:10.520
But they're so friendly and they're like positive

16:10.520 --> 16:13.240
about not doing what I told them to do.

16:13.240 --> 16:18.240
And so before I had a chance to impose

16:18.560 --> 16:21.560
kind of the traditional management structure,

16:21.560 --> 16:23.960
which I had learned so well and honed so well,

16:23.960 --> 16:24.960
I thought, well, you know what?

16:24.960 --> 16:27.760
Red Hat's been really successful before I got there.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.680
I at least need to step back and observe.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.560
And so my management consulting kicked in

16:31.560 --> 16:32.880
and that's what I did.

16:32.880 --> 16:34.680
And I have to say, I felt a little bit,

16:34.680 --> 16:38.760
like an anthropologist tossed into some odd ecosystem.

16:38.760 --> 16:41.200
And I really had to hold myself back

16:41.200 --> 16:42.840
from wanting to inject myself.

16:42.840 --> 16:45.320
And I have to say the first few months at Red Hat

16:45.320 --> 16:47.400
were, I think it's fair to say shocking.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.280
It was just so different than anything

16:49.280 --> 16:51.120
I'd ever been used to.

16:51.120 --> 16:54.320
And I realized my role as a leader

16:54.320 --> 16:55.840
was going to look nothing like

16:55.840 --> 16:58.200
what I'd been used to in the past.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.000
My role as a leader would look nothing like

17:00.000 --> 17:01.160
what I was used to in the past.

17:01.160 --> 17:02.800
And the other thing he says in there is that

17:02.800 --> 17:04.920
when I came in, I started to think

17:04.920 --> 17:08.200
my job was going to be to clean this up.

17:08.200 --> 17:12.960
I think that is such a typical manager reaction.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.760
And I don't think it is a typical reaction

17:15.760 --> 17:18.040
to think maybe I'm the one that needs to change.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.520
I think that's anti-typical.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.480
And so when I look at IBM and I look at their leadership

17:23.480 --> 17:25.040
and I look at their culture and I look at the fact

17:25.040 --> 17:26.880
that they're 110 year old company,

17:28.160 --> 17:30.120
I think maybe people running IBM

17:30.120 --> 17:32.920
are not the right people to run Red Hat.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.560
When I look at Red Hat, they're a young innovative company

17:35.560 --> 17:37.800
that's had to be extremely adaptable.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.000
This had to respond in internet time.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
IBM has failed to do that.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
That's why they don't have a stronghold

17:44.000 --> 17:45.280
in the cloud right now.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.200
That's why they needed to buy a company

17:47.200 --> 17:50.240
at the expense that they paid for Red Hat.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.120
Like they were desperate.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.680
It was a desperate move.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.800
And Whitehurst touches on one more thing.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.600
He follows up on that story and it's a demonstration

17:58.600 --> 18:01.680
of the kind of agility you need to have to run Red Hat.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.920
Let me come back to that story about the engineer.

18:03.920 --> 18:07.960
About three months after that initial conversation,

18:07.960 --> 18:10.440
so I was about three and a half months on the job,

18:10.440 --> 18:12.760
that same team came back to me and said,

18:12.760 --> 18:15.320
you know what, it turns out he was right.

18:15.320 --> 18:17.720
Circumstances have changed in the marketplace

18:17.720 --> 18:20.440
and we need to now go pursue this other direction.

18:20.440 --> 18:22.320
And by the way, we need to go buy a company to do it

18:22.320 --> 18:23.560
and we need to go do that quickly.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.080
And so let's get going.

18:26.280 --> 18:29.240
And that all happened without me asking it to be revisited

18:29.240 --> 18:32.080
or from some planning process.

18:32.080 --> 18:35.280
It just emerged as circumstances had changed

18:35.280 --> 18:37.200
and so we needed to change direction.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.840
I think it's important that the people in that room,

18:40.840 --> 18:45.720
not a single one of them, was apologetic or defensive.

18:45.720 --> 18:46.600
They weren't like me.

18:46.600 --> 18:47.560
They had been there for a while.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.760
They recognized that in a volatile,

18:50.760 --> 18:54.200
more dynamic environment, when circumstances change,

18:54.200 --> 18:55.440
you have to be ready to change.

18:55.440 --> 18:59.600
So success isn't about having the best ideas

18:59.600 --> 19:01.760
or making all the right decisions.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.560
Success is making a lot of decisions,

19:04.560 --> 19:08.000
but being open and transparent and non-defensive enough

19:08.000 --> 19:09.760
to be willing to change those decisions

19:09.760 --> 19:12.120
when circumstances warrant.

19:12.120 --> 19:13.520
That's what's key.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.480
And I fear, although I have no guarantee,

19:16.480 --> 19:17.680
I have no way to actually know for sure,

19:17.680 --> 19:19.400
but I fear that perhaps IBM's leadership

19:19.400 --> 19:23.200
won't be up to that particular kind of leadership challenge.

19:23.200 --> 19:27.400
And if that's the case, it gives me concern long-term

19:27.400 --> 19:30.520
about what kind of impact that could have on Linux

19:30.520 --> 19:32.160
and particularly some of the projects

19:32.160 --> 19:33.480
that Red Hat's involved in

19:33.480 --> 19:36.000
that are the harder bits of work on Linux.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.520
I want everybody to get a chance to jump in.

19:37.520 --> 19:38.840
Wes, did you have any thoughts on that

19:38.840 --> 19:40.840
before I go to the virtual log?

19:40.840 --> 19:44.480
It's sad to see a strong and eloquent person

19:44.480 --> 19:46.880
who can kind of describe open source

19:46.880 --> 19:49.000
and how open source can work with business

19:49.000 --> 19:51.240
and all of the interesting insights

19:51.240 --> 19:52.720
that you just highlighted.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.160
That was a big voice within IBM,

19:54.160 --> 19:56.080
or at least people that had to take him seriously

19:56.080 --> 19:57.000
while he was there.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.560
So I think you're right that there are at least fewer

19:59.560 --> 20:01.200
of those advocates now.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.640
Right, and I do worry that as mergers go,

20:04.640 --> 20:07.680
that could be a bad trend, but maybe not, we'll see.

20:07.680 --> 20:10.680
Perhaps IBM will simply just have too much going on

20:10.680 --> 20:11.800
to care what Red Hat does.

20:11.800 --> 20:12.920
Neil, what are your thoughts?

20:12.920 --> 20:14.840
So I wanna bring up the counterpoint

20:14.840 --> 20:17.440
that you can't be 100 plus years old

20:17.440 --> 20:20.920
and not be able to have an adaptable bone in your body.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.560
Companies don't survive for more than a century

20:24.560 --> 20:25.680
by staying still.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.880
They learn to react, they adapt and do things.

20:28.880 --> 20:32.280
While I'm a little concerned personally

20:32.280 --> 20:34.440
about Jim Whitehurst leaving,

20:34.440 --> 20:36.160
there are all kinds of unrelated reasons

20:36.160 --> 20:37.120
why he might wanna leave.

20:37.120 --> 20:40.040
Maybe it is about like not being at the top like Jack said,

20:40.040 --> 20:43.200
but it might also be the great resignation effect.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.680
There are lots and lots of people

20:45.680 --> 20:46.920
changing their focus in life.

20:46.920 --> 20:51.440
But I will say that about IBM is that

20:51.440 --> 20:54.520
being over 100 years old means you have to make pivots

20:54.520 --> 20:56.240
and changes and adapt at a level

20:56.240 --> 20:58.640
that most companies can't do.

20:58.640 --> 21:01.200
And I haven't met Arvind Krishna.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.200
I don't know anything about him,

21:03.200 --> 21:08.200
but I would imagine that being at IBM for 33 years,

21:09.560 --> 21:14.240
that means that he's seen IBM shift in major ways

21:14.240 --> 21:15.520
over the past three decades

21:15.520 --> 21:19.480
from doing mainframes to personal computers

21:19.480 --> 21:22.400
to software services to business consulting

21:22.400 --> 21:25.320
to the cloud and managed services

21:25.320 --> 21:26.440
and all these sorts of things.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.920
Like there's a ton of pivoting going on

21:28.920 --> 21:29.960
in those three decades.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.800
Maybe they weren't all successful,

21:31.800 --> 21:33.200
but I think the more important aspect

21:33.200 --> 21:36.640
is that IBM is still here and they still keep trying.

21:36.640 --> 21:38.400
And yes, there's still some cause for concern.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.320
I'm a little worried myself because Red Hat

21:41.320 --> 21:44.920
is a fantastic leader in free and open source

21:44.920 --> 21:46.880
and they do a good job of adapting

21:46.880 --> 21:48.600
to their realities on the ground

21:48.600 --> 21:52.080
and working to provide high quality solutions.

21:52.080 --> 21:55.120
But that's not to say IBM can't do that too.

21:55.120 --> 21:58.200
I think it's more of a question of whether Arvind

21:58.200 --> 22:00.160
when he, as being the CEO of IBM

22:00.160 --> 22:02.560
will actually learn from the Red Hat folks

22:02.560 --> 22:05.400
about how he should handle the Red Hat business unit.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.400
Cause you know, like it or not,

22:07.400 --> 22:09.440
Red Hat is a business unit of IBM,

22:09.440 --> 22:11.720
semi-autonomous and could run on its own.

22:11.720 --> 22:14.240
It has its own legal, has its own HR,

22:14.240 --> 22:18.200
has its own finance, has its own executives.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.680
IBM runs it somewhat independently,

22:20.680 --> 22:22.400
like a lot of the other business units.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.920
That's why they're business units.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.400
So I would be mildly concerned,

22:26.400 --> 22:28.520
but I'm also more of the wait and see camp

22:28.520 --> 22:29.920
and we'll see how it goes.

22:29.920 --> 22:32.400
Like IBM has been around for over a century.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.240
They've gotta be doing something right.

22:34.240 --> 22:35.880
Yeah, I think that's pretty reasonable.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.120
That's a reasonable position.

22:37.120 --> 22:38.840
And it kind of makes me hopeful

22:38.840 --> 22:41.520
that they will let Red Hat be Red Hat

22:41.520 --> 22:43.320
and continue to do their thing.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.520
Because I think the whole ecosystem thrives

22:45.520 --> 22:49.280
when we have really strong companies that are like,

22:49.280 --> 22:51.880
I think of Canonical in that group

22:51.880 --> 22:53.160
and I think of SUSE in that group

22:53.160 --> 22:55.960
and I think of Red Hat kind of in this class of companies

22:55.960 --> 22:58.240
that are doing some of the really hard work

22:58.240 --> 23:00.920
that has to get done to make Linux a contender.

23:00.920 --> 23:02.680
And we just want as many companies

23:02.680 --> 23:04.280
in that mix as possible, I think.

23:04.280 --> 23:07.000
And I hope that Red Hat can continue to do that.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.600
And so that's why what we're about to talk about

23:09.600 --> 23:13.000
is just, it has so many knock-on ramifications.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.960
And this is part of, I think,

23:14.960 --> 23:18.440
why the choice has gotten harder for server admins.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.840
And I go back to just how critical

23:19.840 --> 23:21.200
the server space is for Linux.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.560
So it's with this change in leadership

23:24.560 --> 23:26.840
that we're going to continue the conversation

23:26.840 --> 23:27.680
in this episode.

23:27.680 --> 23:28.520
But first,

23:30.880 --> 23:32.520
linoad.com slash unplugged.

23:32.520 --> 23:34.840
Go there to get $100 in credit for 60 days

23:34.840 --> 23:37.480
on your new account and support the show.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.720
Linoad's also making our road trip possible

23:39.720 --> 23:40.640
for our team reunion.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.560
We're going to all get together in Denver.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.320
You're invited to Salt Lake City and Denver

23:44.320 --> 23:45.360
to meet up with us.

23:45.360 --> 23:47.320
Linoad's going to be there in Denver.

23:47.320 --> 23:48.240
They're going to have a spot.

23:48.240 --> 23:50.080
They're going to be giving out some swag

23:50.080 --> 23:52.800
and perhaps some treats and goodies too.

23:52.800 --> 23:54.840
So if you're going to be in the Denver area,

23:54.840 --> 23:55.840
come out and say hi to Linoad.

23:55.840 --> 23:57.000
They'll join us out there

23:57.000 --> 23:58.520
because they are helping make the trip possible,

23:58.520 --> 24:00.720
including some of the tech we'll be using

24:00.720 --> 24:03.000
that we'll be talking about in a little bit.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.040
I don't really actually, I don't know when yet,

24:06.040 --> 24:07.200
but I'm working on it.

24:08.120 --> 24:09.000
I'll tell you soon though,

24:09.000 --> 24:10.640
and we'll tell you how they made it possible.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.760
So go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for that.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.720
And go to linoad.com slash unplugged

24:15.720 --> 24:18.560
to get the $100 in credit for your new account.

24:18.560 --> 24:21.760
We're hosting everything for JB 3.0 on Linoad.

24:21.760 --> 24:26.520
I started using them almost three years ago now personally

24:26.520 --> 24:29.960
because everything for JB was on different providers

24:29.960 --> 24:31.280
and different infrastructure.

24:31.280 --> 24:34.400
And I wanted to set up something for myself,

24:35.360 --> 24:36.960
for like game servers and SSH

24:36.960 --> 24:38.880
and just like my own set of things.

24:38.880 --> 24:41.680
And I had seen Linoad around forever

24:41.680 --> 24:45.040
making community events like our team reunion possible.

24:45.040 --> 24:47.440
And so I knew that they were in the community events

24:47.440 --> 24:52.240
that were like actual, real, true community events.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.120
You know, not just like events that are put on

24:54.120 --> 24:55.240
by like large corporations,

24:55.240 --> 24:57.160
but the whole range of ones where like,

24:57.160 --> 24:59.680
it's just a small community and Linoad had a booth there.

24:59.680 --> 25:01.480
And there was an event I was at

25:01.480 --> 25:03.800
where like they were the one booth

25:03.800 --> 25:05.800
that was like really kind of taking the event seriously

25:05.800 --> 25:08.560
and had good stuff and making great conversation.

25:08.560 --> 25:09.520
While some of the other vendors

25:09.520 --> 25:10.520
weren't even staying at their booth,

25:10.520 --> 25:12.960
they were just like off snacking on barbecue.

25:12.960 --> 25:14.440
And I remembered thinking like,

25:14.440 --> 25:15.280
well, you know what?

25:15.280 --> 25:16.600
Linoad's really putting effort into this.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.200
And they had a good looking booth and they had it down.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.920
And I thought, I'm gonna try them out.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.680
And so I did, and I didn't get $100 in credit.

25:22.680 --> 25:26.520
I paid with my own monies and I loved it.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.760
I thought they had the best dashboard out there.

25:28.760 --> 25:29.960
It was nice and clean.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.760
They had the fastest VPSs out there.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.200
They got 11 data centers to choose from.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.560
They've really got the system dialed in.

25:36.560 --> 25:37.400
People often ask like,

25:37.400 --> 25:39.120
well, what's the number one reason you switched to Linoad?

25:39.120 --> 25:41.120
And I suppose maybe I might say

25:41.120 --> 25:43.760
it's probably because of speed, maybe.

25:43.760 --> 25:46.080
But now that I've used it for a while,

25:46.080 --> 25:49.080
it's really because I trust running our production stuff

25:49.080 --> 25:49.920
on Linoad.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.320
Like when it has been crazy hot here

25:51.320 --> 25:53.240
in the Pacific Northwest recently,

25:53.240 --> 25:55.440
I am really glad that the stuff that makes it possible

25:55.440 --> 25:56.680
for you guys to get our shows

25:56.680 --> 25:58.120
and all of the services that support

25:58.120 --> 25:59.520
the production of our shows,

25:59.520 --> 26:01.360
I'm really glad they're up on Linoad.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.360
And you can get a system for like $5 a month

26:03.360 --> 26:05.040
and they're 35 to 50% cheaper

26:05.040 --> 26:06.920
than the major cloud providers out there.

26:06.920 --> 26:11.400
And it was like 120 degrees recently in the studio garage.

26:11.400 --> 26:14.920
I just had to shut down our NASA, I just turned it off.

26:14.920 --> 26:17.000
I turned off the modem too.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.720
I mean, it was like 120 in there, right?

26:18.720 --> 26:20.320
Meanwhile, the Linoad systems are sitting there

26:20.320 --> 26:22.160
in their perfectly temperature controlled data centers

26:22.160 --> 26:23.520
with their 40 gigabit connections,

26:23.520 --> 26:25.400
just humming right along, you know?

26:25.400 --> 26:27.400
And like, there's a lot of reasons.

26:27.400 --> 26:30.400
So go try out the $100 and see what you get.

26:30.400 --> 26:31.640
You know, play with it.

26:31.640 --> 26:34.320
Just experiment like I did originally.

26:34.320 --> 26:36.240
I was just curious.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.000
I wanted to try it out,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.120
but now you can do that with $100 for 60 days.

26:40.120 --> 26:40.960
That's great.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.200
And you can really put something up there

26:42.200 --> 26:44.840
and really bang on it and see what it can do.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.200
So go to linoad.com slash unplugged.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.240
Get that $100 for your new account

26:49.240 --> 26:50.600
and you support the show.

26:50.600 --> 26:53.120
There are a lot of different options for hosting,

26:53.120 --> 26:54.480
but Linoad does it all.

26:54.480 --> 26:55.920
And they do it better than everybody else,

26:55.920 --> 26:58.560
including their object storage, their interface

26:58.560 --> 27:00.440
and their fantastic customer service.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.400
linoad.com slash unplugged.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.400
So let's get into the story that we cut last week.

27:07.400 --> 27:10.080
We didn't cut it because it was like so spicy

27:10.080 --> 27:13.520
and, you know, Wes, well, I mean, Wes did swear a lot.

27:13.520 --> 27:14.360
That happened.

27:14.360 --> 27:15.200
Yeah, I know.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.320
I came in a little hot, whoops.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.240
You get fired up about enterprise distros.

27:18.240 --> 27:19.080
That's your thing.

27:19.080 --> 27:19.920
I do.

27:19.920 --> 27:20.840
Yeah.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.960
And we actually were just gonna play it on the show.

27:22.960 --> 27:24.200
It was normal because we were just talking

27:24.200 --> 27:27.240
about Rocky Linux's 8.4 Gold Master.

27:27.240 --> 27:29.120
And it was, you know, they'd hit their main release

27:29.120 --> 27:30.200
and that was a good moment.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.640
We were happy for them and thought, okay,

27:32.640 --> 27:33.480
let's get it in the show.

27:33.480 --> 27:34.960
You know, we'll have this,

27:34.960 --> 27:36.680
we'll document the moment they actually hit the release

27:36.680 --> 27:40.600
because I felt for a long time that the long tail

27:40.600 --> 27:42.520
is what's really gonna reveal

27:42.520 --> 27:44.440
if these enterprise distros are standing up.

27:44.440 --> 27:46.320
Like what I mean by that is it's like a three

27:46.320 --> 27:48.160
or four or five year game

27:48.160 --> 27:49.880
before you're gonna have a really good sense

27:49.880 --> 27:52.480
which one of these is a RHEL replacement, right?

27:52.480 --> 27:55.120
This is the enterprise we're talking about.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.920
But we wanted to cut the segment anyways

27:56.920 --> 27:59.440
because we felt it was better in completion

27:59.440 --> 28:02.200
to play the segment itself.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.160
And then the reaction we got a little bit after that

28:04.160 --> 28:07.080
that we felt was like a really good transparent conversation

28:07.080 --> 28:08.320
that was informative.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.320
And so we started the coverage.

28:10.320 --> 28:11.800
I'm gonna play it for you now.

28:11.800 --> 28:14.080
Talking about the initial response

28:14.080 --> 28:16.240
that Rocky was seeing from their release.

28:16.240 --> 28:19.720
Yeah, sounds like within 72 hours of that launch,

28:19.720 --> 28:24.400
Rocky's assets have been downloaded nearly 70,000 times.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.640
Hey, that sounds like some excitement out there.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.560
Yeah, and that's from the mirrors

28:28.560 --> 28:30.880
that they can get numbers from.

28:30.880 --> 28:34.160
That doesn't really count trackers for torrents

28:34.160 --> 28:37.800
or maybe other mirrors that are just providing downloads.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.560
This post also took some time to clarify a little bit

28:40.560 --> 28:42.640
about the structure

28:42.640 --> 28:45.200
of the Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation

28:45.200 --> 28:49.400
which is a public benefit corporation formed in Delaware,

28:49.400 --> 28:50.800
where else, right?

28:50.800 --> 28:53.400
Backed by a board of advisors with access control policies

28:53.400 --> 28:55.080
that utilize the principle of least privilege

28:55.080 --> 28:56.760
and separation of duty

28:56.760 --> 28:59.000
so that no action can be taken unilaterally

28:59.000 --> 29:01.520
not even by the owner, Gregory Kurtzler.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.600
So it sounds like there's some work here to try to say,

29:03.600 --> 29:06.920
look, yes, we're trying to do this above board.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.320
Here's how our structure is.

29:08.320 --> 29:09.720
You can decide if you like it.

29:09.720 --> 29:12.800
Yeah, and so there's two key bits of information

29:12.800 --> 29:14.760
in what you just told us there.

29:14.760 --> 29:18.120
Number one, they're a public benefit corporation.

29:18.120 --> 29:21.680
Now that's different than a charity, but it's notable.

29:21.680 --> 29:22.720
We'll come back to that.

29:22.720 --> 29:26.200
And number two, they are clarifying

29:26.200 --> 29:30.400
that Greg is the legal owner of that foundation

29:30.400 --> 29:31.320
and of Rocky Linux.

29:31.320 --> 29:34.400
And so the way a public benefit corporation works

29:34.400 --> 29:38.520
is after you've spent the money on what the project is,

29:38.520 --> 29:40.760
the additional remaining revenue, the way I understand it

29:40.760 --> 29:43.760
goes to pay out the staff, including the owner.

29:43.760 --> 29:45.040
That's just important to note

29:45.040 --> 29:48.840
because when we're looking at these different distributions

29:48.840 --> 29:50.320
and there's gonna be several of them,

29:50.320 --> 29:53.120
we need to understand how the entire structure

29:53.120 --> 29:54.360
around them works.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.240
How does the support model work?

29:56.240 --> 29:59.680
How does the public governance model work?

29:59.680 --> 30:03.440
And what is the revenue angle for each participant involved?

30:03.440 --> 30:06.080
And so we start now to get some insights

30:06.080 --> 30:09.600
into what maybe could be the revenue model.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.920
That doesn't mean that Rocky Linux isn't great

30:11.920 --> 30:14.000
and that it's not gonna be a fantastic distribution

30:14.000 --> 30:16.040
because don't you want the people involved

30:16.040 --> 30:18.680
to be living happy, well-off lives?

30:18.680 --> 30:22.440
I mean, if they create a well-loved product

30:22.440 --> 30:24.680
that is successful in the market,

30:24.680 --> 30:26.600
it seems fair that they should

30:26.600 --> 30:28.000
have a comfortable living from that.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.360
So I don't really have a problem with the structure,

30:31.360 --> 30:33.960
but I felt like we just didn't have a lot of clarity

30:33.960 --> 30:35.880
in the past around the structure.

30:35.880 --> 30:37.120
And now we do.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.240
And now I feel like all the cards

30:38.240 --> 30:39.360
are out there on the table.

30:39.360 --> 30:40.560
Well, now it matters, I think,

30:40.560 --> 30:42.000
how they actually communicate, right?

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
We've got this little clarification here,

30:44.000 --> 30:45.600
but really what it comes down to is like,

30:45.600 --> 30:47.560
if you're asked to give money to this foundation,

30:47.560 --> 30:49.000
if you're trying to support things,

30:49.000 --> 30:51.520
is it still made clear to those in the future, right?

30:51.520 --> 30:52.440
That's a great point too.

30:52.440 --> 30:54.520
And as long as we're all clear about it,

30:54.520 --> 30:57.360
I say more power to them, move forward.

30:57.360 --> 30:59.880
And I hope we continue to see this pattern of transparency.

30:59.880 --> 31:03.840
And I think we've also witnessed a bit of a tweak

31:03.840 --> 31:07.640
in the Rocky Linux's approach to community.

31:07.640 --> 31:09.800
They seem to be pretty passionate.

31:09.800 --> 31:10.880
I've heard from a couple of them

31:10.880 --> 31:13.360
who wanted to kind of allay some of my concerns

31:13.360 --> 31:16.360
and they approached me with a very reasonable,

31:16.360 --> 31:17.360
friendly dialogue.

31:17.360 --> 31:19.800
And we exchanged a bit of a back and forth

31:19.800 --> 31:21.040
and I had a good experience there.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.960
And so I like that they're taking those steps,

31:23.960 --> 31:26.240
but at the same time, we have to sit back

31:26.240 --> 31:28.480
and kind of watch and see how all commitments are met,

31:28.480 --> 31:30.520
how this thing plays out for a long time

31:30.520 --> 31:32.560
before any one particular winner is declared

31:32.560 --> 31:35.120
as the traditional CentOS replacement.

31:36.040 --> 31:39.160
Because really, the game is still afoot.

31:39.160 --> 31:42.880
And this is just the starting line right now

31:42.880 --> 31:44.960
with Rocky Linux hitting version 8.4.

31:44.960 --> 31:46.040
We're just getting started.

31:46.040 --> 31:48.280
Yeah, we'll see you in like four years, I guess.

31:48.280 --> 31:50.160
Yeah, maybe, right?

31:50.160 --> 31:54.160
I mean, Enterprise 7, I don't know how long you wait.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.560
I think you just sort of sit back and watch, I suppose,

31:56.560 --> 31:58.760
but it is a tricky one.

31:58.760 --> 32:00.760
Now, you might not expect it,

32:00.760 --> 32:03.040
but that topic provoked quite the response

32:03.040 --> 32:07.080
that we thought needed to be in the show.

32:07.080 --> 32:10.160
Alma Linux's community manager joined us

32:10.160 --> 32:14.280
and shared his perspective after we wrapped up last week.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.160
So the following discussion took place

32:16.160 --> 32:18.280
on the live stream after the show.

32:18.280 --> 32:21.640
And just a note, we have reached out to Rocky Linux.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.160
I emailed their community contact

32:23.160 --> 32:24.760
and invited them on the show.

32:24.760 --> 32:26.320
I haven't heard back from them yet,

32:26.320 --> 32:28.480
but that invite does remain open.

32:28.480 --> 32:33.480
I think that it's kind of important to note

32:34.040 --> 32:39.040
that the situation there seems a little bit problematic

32:39.080 --> 32:41.560
because you're not any better off

32:41.560 --> 32:44.000
than when Red Hat owned Centos, right?

32:44.000 --> 32:48.840
I mean, it's still owned by one entity, by one person,

32:48.840 --> 32:52.560
and they can decide to do whatever they wanna do with it.

32:52.560 --> 32:57.120
Now, they can say that, yes, we have a board of advisors.

32:57.120 --> 32:59.840
By the way, advisors are not directors.

32:59.840 --> 33:03.040
So it doesn't mean that they really have

33:03.040 --> 33:06.360
any particular say in what happens.

33:06.360 --> 33:09.680
And then they can decide to do

33:09.680 --> 33:11.360
whatever they want with it tomorrow.

33:11.360 --> 33:15.680
So you're not any better off than when Red Hat owned Centos.

33:15.680 --> 33:18.200
I think that's a very big problem.

33:18.200 --> 33:19.760
Yeah, I suppose people would just argue

33:19.760 --> 33:22.280
that they have more faith in the mission

33:22.280 --> 33:25.760
of the Rocky Foundation than they do of Red Hat

33:25.760 --> 33:28.480
to steward it, I suppose.

33:28.480 --> 33:29.920
I guess that's their decision to make,

33:29.920 --> 33:31.400
but yeah, it's a fair point, right?

33:31.400 --> 33:34.640
So in the contrast with Alma Linux,

33:34.640 --> 33:35.920
just for an example,

33:35.920 --> 33:39.120
how would the decision to end producing the distribution came?

33:39.120 --> 33:40.960
Say it's 25 years down the road

33:40.960 --> 33:43.800
and everybody's using Fusion now.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.080
How would that process work

33:45.080 --> 33:47.360
with the governance model of Alma?

33:47.360 --> 33:51.880
So we have a board, a governing board.

33:51.880 --> 33:53.400
It's an open board.

33:53.400 --> 33:55.960
We're gonna announce additional membership guidelines

33:55.960 --> 33:58.760
so that additional people can join that board.

33:58.760 --> 34:02.480
Think the plan is to ultimately have that be at 13 members.

34:02.480 --> 34:05.720
So it'll be a nice mix of people from within the community

34:05.720 --> 34:08.840
versus corporate interests as well.

34:08.840 --> 34:13.840
And really just anybody that has any interest in the distro.

34:14.240 --> 34:17.520
And then, let's say 25 years down the line,

34:17.520 --> 34:21.040
we decided that we wanna stop making the distribution.

34:21.040 --> 34:23.640
That's a decision for the board to make.

34:23.640 --> 34:27.000
I'm assuming it would be proposed and there would be a vote.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.280
And if the votes came back,

34:29.280 --> 34:30.760
the majority or whatever it is

34:30.760 --> 34:32.880
that we decided to do to vote on it,

34:32.880 --> 34:34.560
and that's what the board wanted to do,

34:34.560 --> 34:36.640
then things would wind down.

34:36.640 --> 34:38.480
It's a vote process basically there.

34:38.480 --> 34:41.200
Yeah, I mean, it's a real community process.

34:41.200 --> 34:44.960
They're people that have an interest, have a say,

34:44.960 --> 34:47.320
they get to decide what happens.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.160
We're all in this debacle

34:49.160 --> 34:53.040
because that's not how Santos originally was.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.920
Or not originally, well, once Red Hat took over,

34:55.920 --> 34:57.320
that's not how it was.

34:57.320 --> 35:00.120
There was one party that held all the keys

35:00.120 --> 35:02.640
and that's not really changing at all

35:02.640 --> 35:04.720
with Rocky's governance model.

35:04.720 --> 35:08.920
So some people might say, I think it's great

35:08.920 --> 35:11.920
that they're trying to make money off it

35:11.920 --> 35:14.600
and that this is the way they set it up.

35:14.600 --> 35:17.040
But I just think that as a community,

35:17.040 --> 35:19.440
we need to look a little bit more broadly

35:19.440 --> 35:21.200
and think about what we value.

35:21.200 --> 35:23.760
And to me, at least that comes back to

35:23.760 --> 35:26.640
community ownership, stakeholder ownership,

35:26.640 --> 35:30.640
the community gets to drive and decide what the future is.

35:30.640 --> 35:33.600
That's really a very, very important point

35:33.600 --> 35:38.080
that I think many people may not realize yet

35:38.080 --> 35:42.280
and they may be purposely turning a blind eye.

35:42.280 --> 35:43.120
As you touched on there,

35:43.120 --> 35:45.720
isn't it like, doesn't the composition of that

35:45.720 --> 35:47.440
kind of matter, like if it,

35:47.440 --> 35:49.720
I could imagine a version where the corporate interests

35:49.720 --> 35:52.760
were dominating that if they had the voting control set?

35:52.760 --> 35:54.600
I can kind of speak a little bit about this

35:54.600 --> 35:57.240
because the OpenSUSE project is structured similarly,

35:57.240 --> 35:58.680
though it is of course owned by SUSE

35:58.680 --> 36:01.040
and not legally separated, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

36:01.040 --> 36:04.280
The board is actually set up in such a way

36:04.280 --> 36:06.920
that it is not possible for a single corporate entity

36:06.920 --> 36:11.280
to have majority membership in the board.

36:11.280 --> 36:13.960
And whether that's good or bad,

36:13.960 --> 36:18.960
one thing that rule basically preys on the thought pattern

36:19.160 --> 36:21.400
that companies don't actually like

36:21.400 --> 36:23.240
working together very much.

36:23.240 --> 36:25.440
They have a hard time figuring out

36:25.440 --> 36:27.840
how to collaborate at a business level.

36:27.840 --> 36:32.160
And by making it so that there is not a path

36:32.160 --> 36:35.960
for a clear majority for any particular company,

36:35.960 --> 36:38.080
they would essentially have to build a coalition

36:38.080 --> 36:39.160
to make something to happen,

36:39.160 --> 36:41.120
which means effectively the community

36:41.120 --> 36:42.360
would have to have a say in it

36:42.360 --> 36:44.520
and would have to agree to it anyway.

36:44.520 --> 36:48.280
Is there kind of a protection against one particular entity,

36:48.280 --> 36:49.800
perhaps Cloud Linux,

36:49.800 --> 36:53.400
having significant influence on the board like that?

36:53.400 --> 36:56.920
Yeah, so we're actually in the process

36:56.920 --> 37:00.240
of putting together the membership guidelines

37:00.240 --> 37:03.200
for participation on the board.

37:03.200 --> 37:05.920
And that is definitely one of the principles there.

37:05.920 --> 37:09.440
I mean, our plan is to completely dilute Cloud Linux.

37:09.440 --> 37:11.920
Like I know when things first came out,

37:11.920 --> 37:13.160
like everything in the press said,

37:13.160 --> 37:14.840
Cloud Linux, Cloud Linux, Cloud Linux.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.600
Well, that's because Cloud Linux started it,

37:17.600 --> 37:20.240
but the plan is to totally dilute Cloud Linux

37:20.240 --> 37:22.920
and exactly like Neil was talking about,

37:22.920 --> 37:25.400
it should be based off consensus

37:25.400 --> 37:27.200
and based off what the community wants.

37:27.200 --> 37:30.160
So that's totally what we're planning on doing.

37:30.160 --> 37:33.680
Okay, so it sounds like it's not fully firm yet,

37:33.680 --> 37:34.880
but it's getting worked out.

37:34.880 --> 37:39.320
Let's say the board now was always meant to be provisional

37:39.320 --> 37:44.320
because first of all, we need to form a structure.

37:46.040 --> 37:48.400
Legal documents need to be filled out,

37:48.400 --> 37:50.960
bylaws need to be set up and accepted.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.960
So that was all meant to be provisional

37:52.960 --> 37:55.920
while we work on the membership essentially.

37:55.920 --> 37:58.840
And then once we have the membership in place,

37:58.840 --> 38:00.760
that's when we'll have elections

38:00.760 --> 38:03.320
and we will invite everybody

38:03.320 --> 38:05.320
to participate in those elections.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.840
Okay, I track your point earlier too.

38:07.840 --> 38:10.520
I think when you see the reaction that we saw

38:10.520 --> 38:13.720
when Red Hat announced that they'd be discontinuing

38:13.720 --> 38:16.480
the traditional release model of CentOS,

38:16.480 --> 38:19.480
people reacted in a way like they were shocked

38:19.480 --> 38:21.000
at the arrangement.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.040
Like all of a sudden, the reality of the arrangement

38:24.040 --> 38:25.720
hit them right in the face.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.960
And it does feel like one of the lessons learned

38:28.960 --> 38:32.080
when you're looking back at that initial shock is,

38:32.080 --> 38:33.640
oh yeah, there was a single entity

38:33.640 --> 38:35.960
that was in total unilateral control ultimately

38:35.960 --> 38:38.360
that could make decisions like this.

38:38.360 --> 38:41.200
And if we are gonna move to something else,

38:41.200 --> 38:42.240
and I think that's why a lot of people

38:42.240 --> 38:43.720
looked at something like Debian,

38:43.720 --> 38:47.560
even though it's a significantly big transition,

38:47.560 --> 38:48.880
I think people looked at Debian and said,

38:48.880 --> 38:51.400
that's a governance model that perhaps insulates

38:51.400 --> 38:53.200
from these kinds of surprises.

38:53.200 --> 38:56.520
And I think, so your point that you're making is,

38:56.520 --> 38:59.920
if you're gonna move to another system besides CentOS,

38:59.920 --> 39:02.520
and you're looking for CentOS like compatibility,

39:02.520 --> 39:04.720
the governance model is something you need to consider

39:04.720 --> 39:06.760
because that was what ultimately bit everyone

39:06.760 --> 39:09.080
in the butt originally.

39:09.080 --> 39:12.000
And if people are able to look at the board structure

39:12.000 --> 39:14.080
and see that while cloud Linux is involved,

39:14.080 --> 39:16.320
they don't necessarily control things,

39:16.320 --> 39:19.080
that I think could be a really big deal.

39:19.080 --> 39:20.840
But you have to, you're right in the sense

39:20.840 --> 39:22.280
that you have to make people aware

39:22.280 --> 39:24.200
that it's something they even need to consider

39:24.200 --> 39:27.720
because right now, what Rocky Linux has,

39:27.720 --> 39:30.360
I think going for it in a pretty powerful way

39:30.360 --> 39:34.000
is this narrative about one of the original co-founders.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.920
And because the original co-founder of this original idea

39:37.920 --> 39:41.080
is involved, that makes Rocky Linux significant.

39:41.080 --> 39:43.760
Now, I can't really throw shade on them

39:43.760 --> 39:46.680
for leveraging a positive spin,

39:46.680 --> 39:48.240
a narrative that they've been given.

39:48.240 --> 39:52.120
Like that's, they've been given a gift in that regard

39:52.120 --> 39:52.960
and they're using it.

39:52.960 --> 39:55.360
And I can't really give them a hard time for it

39:55.360 --> 39:57.440
because that's, most people would.

39:57.440 --> 39:58.760
Yeah, exactly.

39:58.760 --> 40:02.360
Well, I don't think we should give way to any spin

40:02.360 --> 40:04.640
because I think the truth is the truth.

40:04.640 --> 40:07.760
And I don't wanna get into that right now,

40:07.760 --> 40:12.000
but there's certainly been a lot of spin,

40:12.000 --> 40:16.840
which I don't wanna, that's not what I'm about.

40:16.840 --> 40:20.560
I'm about building bridges and about doing the right thing.

40:20.560 --> 40:24.120
And I think that for anyone that cares about free

40:24.120 --> 40:27.760
and open source software and cares about the community,

40:27.760 --> 40:29.440
look, I get it, I understand.

40:29.440 --> 40:31.320
People want free RHEL, right?

40:31.320 --> 40:33.000
That's what people want.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.040
And that's why everyone was up in arms

40:35.040 --> 40:38.680
because people like RHEL and people want RHEL to be free.

40:38.680 --> 40:41.320
But I think if you really care about community

40:41.320 --> 40:44.760
and you really care about free and open source software,

40:44.760 --> 40:46.920
and you really care about this movement

40:46.920 --> 40:50.320
that took close to two decades to build,

40:50.320 --> 40:52.000
to get to where we've gotten,

40:52.000 --> 40:54.120
I think you need to really take a solid look

40:54.120 --> 40:56.160
at what are the leadership structures?

40:56.160 --> 40:58.240
What are the ownership structures?

40:58.240 --> 41:02.080
And ask yourself, what does that really mean to me?

41:02.080 --> 41:04.600
If you're all about just getting free software

41:04.600 --> 41:06.960
and just taking it and running with it

41:06.960 --> 41:08.840
and doing what you wanna do with it,

41:08.840 --> 41:10.600
then I hear that argument too.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.840
But I think if you really care about things,

41:12.840 --> 41:14.280
you need to take a deeper look

41:14.280 --> 41:17.680
and really ask yourself what values you stand for

41:17.680 --> 41:20.560
and what this all means to you, and then make a decision.

41:20.560 --> 41:23.600
Yeah, and this is something that has bothered me a lot

41:23.600 --> 41:26.920
about this whole Sandhouse conversation as well, right?

41:26.920 --> 41:30.680
So I work in Fedora and I work in OpenSUSE

41:30.680 --> 41:32.000
and I work in CentOS,

41:32.000 --> 41:34.640
and all three of those are owned by corporate entities

41:34.640 --> 41:37.200
that don't really have formal legal separation.

41:37.200 --> 41:42.040
And everything is just like a promise more or less, right?

41:42.040 --> 41:44.720
I work under that structure as it is today.

41:44.720 --> 41:48.560
In general, I am fairly comfortable with that

41:48.560 --> 41:52.480
because if you understand the dynamics

41:52.480 --> 41:54.960
of what's going on in a particular,

41:54.960 --> 41:57.320
in the developer side of the community,

41:57.320 --> 41:59.400
then it tends to be fine.

41:59.400 --> 42:02.720
So in Fedora, we don't really have those conversations

42:02.720 --> 42:06.200
anymore about Fedora being its governance

42:06.200 --> 42:08.840
being problematic or whatnot, because it's clearly not.

42:08.840 --> 42:13.840
It's clearly been fine for almost 18 years now.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.920
It's not an issue anymore.

42:16.920 --> 42:20.200
For CentOS, the thing with them is

42:20.200 --> 42:22.360
throughout most of its history,

42:22.360 --> 42:24.200
and I don't wanna name specific examples,

42:24.200 --> 42:25.960
but throughout most of its history,

42:25.960 --> 42:27.920
it has had a very troubled governance,

42:27.920 --> 42:29.360
even before Red Hat.

42:29.360 --> 42:30.960
It has had a very troubled governance.

42:30.960 --> 42:33.720
It's been a very difficult project

42:33.720 --> 42:35.400
to maintain and bring up.

42:35.400 --> 42:39.320
And you can go back and see the specific examples.

42:39.320 --> 42:42.080
But today, something that's been consistent

42:42.080 --> 42:46.400
with the CentOS project is that the CentOS project

42:46.400 --> 42:50.480
wasn't a project for contributing to.

42:50.480 --> 42:53.000
Like when Lance Davis created the project

42:53.000 --> 42:57.280
with the others, including Greg,

42:57.280 --> 42:59.800
they made it really to be a platform

42:59.800 --> 43:02.760
that they would consume to bootstrap Chaos Linux.

43:02.760 --> 43:06.400
And Chaos was supposed to be the real platform in the end,

43:06.400 --> 43:08.840
and nobody was interested in Chaos.

43:08.840 --> 43:12.600
And so CentOS won out because people just wanted something

43:12.600 --> 43:15.480
that they would use and didn't really wanna contribute to.

43:15.480 --> 43:17.880
And that particular mindset stuck through

43:17.880 --> 43:20.200
as CentOS broke out of Chaos.

43:20.200 --> 43:24.160
And that also opens up the question,

43:24.160 --> 43:27.360
like as Jack said, what are your values?

43:27.360 --> 43:28.200
What do you stand for?

43:28.200 --> 43:30.480
What are you trying to achieve here?

43:30.480 --> 43:32.800
The biggest problem that I've always had with CentOS,

43:32.800 --> 43:35.120
the reason why it was never interesting to me

43:35.120 --> 43:37.200
up until a couple of years ago,

43:37.200 --> 43:39.520
is that there's nothing I can do with it.

43:39.520 --> 43:42.640
It was not meaningful to me as someone who wanted

43:42.640 --> 43:46.280
to make the free and open source software better

43:46.280 --> 43:48.520
and more accessible and all those sorts of things.

43:48.520 --> 43:50.920
The CentOS stream effort changes that dynamic

43:50.920 --> 43:53.280
and makes it possible to do that sort of thing

43:53.280 --> 43:55.520
without really breaking the stability promise

43:55.520 --> 43:56.920
that they offer.

43:56.920 --> 44:00.880
And the problem that I have with how all of this stuff

44:00.880 --> 44:04.960
has been going down is that nobody is thinking of it

44:04.960 --> 44:09.360
in the sense of what would make the community healthy.

44:09.360 --> 44:13.360
It's all about, what did they screw up for me?

44:13.360 --> 44:17.560
Because it is not sustainable to have one

44:17.560 --> 44:20.920
and maybe half a person building an entire distribution

44:20.920 --> 44:22.600
by themselves for everyone to consume

44:22.600 --> 44:25.800
and then complain about when something isn't exactly right

44:25.800 --> 44:26.920
or whatever.

44:26.920 --> 44:29.800
Building a Linux distribution is super difficult.

44:29.800 --> 44:31.880
And I think people had expectations

44:31.880 --> 44:34.280
that they shouldn't have had in the first place.

44:34.280 --> 44:38.040
And I know from personal experience

44:38.040 --> 44:41.200
that the substitution effect is real.

44:41.200 --> 44:45.280
And that substitution effect has created a lot more damage

44:45.280 --> 44:47.520
than I think people actually know.

44:47.520 --> 44:49.120
Like I don't wanna get into specifics about it

44:49.120 --> 44:52.160
because that's really complicated and kind of gory

44:52.160 --> 44:54.160
and that's not what I'm here to talk about.

44:54.160 --> 44:57.760
But I think this as disruptive as it is,

44:57.760 --> 44:59.240
is a good course correction.

44:59.240 --> 45:02.080
Like I sit in both the Rocky and the Alma communities

45:02.080 --> 45:04.320
and as well as being in CentOS,

45:04.320 --> 45:06.880
working in the Hyperscale SIG and stuff like that,

45:06.880 --> 45:08.320
which Hyperscale SIG,

45:08.320 --> 45:10.440
a thing that was never possible before now.

45:10.440 --> 45:12.280
Like that's a huge win.

45:12.280 --> 45:15.440
I've talked to the Alma Linux folks, Jack and many others,

45:15.440 --> 45:19.120
and something that stood out to me was Cloud Linux

45:19.120 --> 45:21.840
and other people participating in the Alma Linux community,

45:21.840 --> 45:23.520
first and foremost are actually engineers

45:23.520 --> 45:25.280
that know how to solve problems and they write code

45:25.280 --> 45:28.840
and they have a business that supports all this stuff.

45:28.840 --> 45:31.800
And they have set up themselves

45:31.800 --> 45:34.400
so that they will be able to contribute directly

45:34.400 --> 45:36.480
to CentOS Stream and to RHEL

45:36.480 --> 45:39.640
whenever something is broken with something from Red Hat.

45:39.640 --> 45:43.520
And that is something we have never, ever, ever had

45:43.520 --> 45:45.400
with a RHEL clone, ever.

45:45.400 --> 45:46.720
Really a new era, huh?

45:46.720 --> 45:49.920
Guys, that's a driving principle for us

45:49.920 --> 45:51.880
that everyone should know that.

45:51.880 --> 45:56.880
I think that there is a ton of good that can be done now

45:57.320 --> 45:59.360
that could not be done before.

45:59.360 --> 46:02.480
And I think that we're not only looking to benefit

46:02.480 --> 46:07.360
from the downstream portion of the relationship,

46:07.360 --> 46:11.160
but we really solidly feel and Neil has seen this

46:11.160 --> 46:13.800
and he's spoken to people about it.

46:13.800 --> 46:15.640
That needs to be a driving force

46:15.640 --> 46:20.640
about what a good CentOS replacement distribution

46:20.960 --> 46:23.800
needs to become in order for the community

46:23.800 --> 46:25.240
to maintain its health.

46:25.240 --> 46:27.760
And I think that that's one of our guiding principles.

46:27.760 --> 46:29.280
I hadn't really considered the fact

46:29.280 --> 46:33.440
that your role could be a significant contribution

46:33.440 --> 46:35.720
to what ultimately will land in RHEL.

46:35.720 --> 46:39.400
And by doing so, you'll be able to solve problems

46:39.400 --> 46:41.240
not just yourselves, but other RHEL users.

46:41.240 --> 46:43.560
And because the way the CentOS stream model now works

46:43.560 --> 46:47.240
is people can now make an impact at that point

46:47.240 --> 46:48.840
that'll ultimately end up in RHEL.

46:48.840 --> 46:50.080
And that being open like that,

46:50.080 --> 46:53.960
I think is the aspect of this transition to CentOS stream

46:53.960 --> 46:56.320
that the community hasn't realized yet.

46:56.320 --> 46:59.880
I think until we've moved past like December 31st

46:59.880 --> 47:01.640
or whatever the end date is,

47:01.640 --> 47:04.400
I think the community just won't wrap its head around

47:04.400 --> 47:06.080
the fundamental shift that's happened here.

47:06.080 --> 47:10.320
And so, Jack, this is my analysis, if you will.

47:10.320 --> 47:13.760
Number one, Rocky Linux got a great start

47:13.760 --> 47:14.680
with that narrative.

47:14.680 --> 47:18.320
Number two, Alma Linux, just because of the timing

47:18.320 --> 47:20.760
and just how things just naturally played out,

47:20.760 --> 47:23.720
really initially got brand recognition as Cloud Linux.

47:23.720 --> 47:26.640
And I think that's a potential headwind.

47:26.640 --> 47:29.000
Then you combine that headwind

47:29.000 --> 47:31.940
with people haven't actually realized the value

47:31.940 --> 47:34.060
of having significant engineers and contributors

47:34.060 --> 47:36.200
in the CentOS stream ecosystem yet.

47:36.200 --> 47:38.400
And so it seems to me,

47:38.400 --> 47:40.480
like it's just gonna be one of these,

47:40.480 --> 47:42.280
you'll have to grind it out and get there

47:42.280 --> 47:44.520
and sort of earn attention over time

47:44.520 --> 47:48.520
because it's sort of like the initial cards that were dealt

47:48.520 --> 47:50.760
perhaps aren't as favorable as they could have been.

47:50.760 --> 47:53.520
But ultimately, when you look at the entire picture,

47:53.520 --> 47:55.160
it seems clear, I think,

47:55.160 --> 47:56.920
what will draw people to Alma Linux.

47:56.920 --> 47:58.320
But it seems like it's gonna take a little bit

47:58.320 --> 48:00.240
for people to appreciate all the value.

48:00.240 --> 48:03.160
You're definitely true in a certain sense.

48:03.160 --> 48:06.360
And I think that the whole spin with the press

48:07.220 --> 48:09.100
was a little bit one-sided,

48:09.100 --> 48:12.000
but I mean, that's nothing that we can control, right?

48:12.000 --> 48:14.640
We can only do what we can do.

48:14.640 --> 48:19.000
And I think on the other end of the spectrum,

48:19.000 --> 48:21.340
we certainly have a great narrative as well.

48:21.340 --> 48:23.720
I mean, like we have core team members

48:23.720 --> 48:27.540
that have been rebuilding RHEL for almost 15 years.

48:27.540 --> 48:30.980
Like that's pretty significant.

48:30.980 --> 48:32.940
We have a ton of experience.

48:32.940 --> 48:35.720
Like we were able to rebuild eight, four

48:35.720 --> 48:37.040
in like three and a half days.

48:37.040 --> 48:39.240
That's phenomenal, you know?

48:39.240 --> 48:42.760
And I think that's one element that was also missing

48:42.760 --> 48:44.720
from the narrative overall.

48:44.720 --> 48:49.640
And I'm very comfortable with us having to earn our keep.

48:49.640 --> 48:52.760
I think we're not trying to rest on our laurels.

48:52.760 --> 48:55.120
We're not trying to spin anything.

48:55.120 --> 48:59.080
We're not trying to have people trust us blindly,

48:59.080 --> 48:59.920
none of that.

48:59.920 --> 49:01.080
I think we're here to work.

49:01.080 --> 49:04.080
And the best thing we can do is continue doing that

49:04.080 --> 49:08.120
good work, continue being members of the community,

49:08.120 --> 49:10.200
continue building for the community,

49:10.200 --> 49:12.880
and just earn people's trust and build bridges.

49:12.880 --> 49:14.920
That's what we're all about.

49:14.920 --> 49:17.640
I think now CentOS has earned its name

49:17.640 --> 49:19.240
more than it ever has before.

49:19.240 --> 49:22.460
It is the community enterprise operating system

49:22.460 --> 49:25.720
because the community has the ability to contribute,

49:25.720 --> 49:29.880
develop, and deliver an enterprise Linux platform.

49:29.880 --> 49:31.640
We've never had that before.

49:31.640 --> 49:33.560
And I'm gonna just spread a little bit

49:33.560 --> 49:34.960
and talk about OpenSUSE too.

49:34.960 --> 49:37.280
OpenSUSE Leap is doing the same thing.

49:37.280 --> 49:41.480
Now we have both top tier enterprise Linux platforms

49:41.480 --> 49:45.280
moving their models so that they're more community centric.

49:45.280 --> 49:47.000
The Red Hat one is a little bit more painful

49:47.000 --> 49:49.560
because the user base is just worse

49:49.560 --> 49:51.840
in the sense that they are not used

49:51.840 --> 49:54.160
to actually working in the project.

49:54.160 --> 49:57.120
And now that's gonna have to change.

49:57.120 --> 50:00.580
And CentOS Stream is fine, even for the average person,

50:00.580 --> 50:03.320
not really doing much of anything with it.

50:03.320 --> 50:05.880
But it's also now, if there is a problem,

50:05.880 --> 50:08.160
there's an opportunity to fix it.

50:08.160 --> 50:10.140
That is powerful.

50:10.140 --> 50:11.380
That is important.

50:11.380 --> 50:13.880
That is how free software survives.

50:13.880 --> 50:16.920
To Neil's comment about it being actually honoring its name

50:16.920 --> 50:19.820
and being a community enterprise distribution,

50:19.820 --> 50:22.380
now we finally have a setup where all real derivatives

50:22.380 --> 50:25.280
can actually work together in the CentOS community

50:25.280 --> 50:26.900
and make the entire ecosystem better,

50:26.900 --> 50:28.540
not just their own derivative.

50:28.540 --> 50:30.420
That's something we've never had before.

50:30.420 --> 50:32.840
And also, following up from Neil's other comment

50:32.840 --> 50:35.940
about just having a handful of people working on CentOS,

50:35.940 --> 50:37.820
that's what a lot of people don't seem to understand

50:37.820 --> 50:40.620
is that there was never an incentive for RHEL

50:40.620 --> 50:43.980
to staff up the CentOS engineering effort at all.

50:43.980 --> 50:45.700
It was, they were kind of competing

50:45.700 --> 50:47.120
with themselves in a way.

50:47.120 --> 50:50.240
But now with the transition of making RHEL derived

50:50.240 --> 50:54.500
from CentOS in a way, now with the CentOS 9 effort,

50:54.500 --> 50:57.380
you're seeing all of these RHEL teams come together

50:57.380 --> 51:00.740
and work on this, and there are orders of magnitude

51:00.740 --> 51:04.180
more people getting involved working on it than ever before.

51:04.180 --> 51:06.720
To me, that's crucial to CentOS's long-term health,

51:06.720 --> 51:09.700
even though it's a change that not everyone likes.

51:09.700 --> 51:13.340
That was just the start of the conversation, really.

51:13.340 --> 51:16.220
The community of enterprise Linux is changing.

51:16.220 --> 51:21.220
And I think coming out into the open more than ever before.

51:21.340 --> 51:23.900
We hope Greg or anyone from Rocky Linux

51:23.900 --> 51:25.900
will take us up on our invitation

51:25.900 --> 51:29.160
and join us on an episode to chat about this more.

51:29.160 --> 51:34.160
Linux.entropy.works, use promo code LUB13 and save 15%.

51:35.780 --> 51:37.820
I'm so excited to have Entropy as a sponsor

51:37.820 --> 51:40.700
for Linux Unplugged because I always say shop local

51:40.700 --> 51:42.460
in the Linux community when you can.

51:42.460 --> 51:44.180
And Entropy is a development shop

51:44.180 --> 51:46.100
that puts desktop Linux first.

51:46.100 --> 51:47.860
They're an industry-leading mobile

51:47.860 --> 51:49.500
and web development studio based in the UK

51:49.500 --> 51:51.300
with global clients including Mars Wrigley,

51:51.300 --> 51:53.540
Walmart, MediaCom, the Financial Times.

51:53.540 --> 51:55.400
I mean, they're just trusted by the biggest names

51:55.400 --> 51:56.860
in media and content,

51:56.860 --> 52:00.840
but it's not all about those big global corporates either.

52:00.840 --> 52:03.160
Entropy loves working with smaller businesses and startups

52:03.160 --> 52:06.140
to realize some truly outstanding mobile desktop

52:06.140 --> 52:08.380
and web applications.

52:08.380 --> 52:09.300
They can do it all.

52:09.300 --> 52:12.860
And yeah, they run it all on Linux and open source.

52:12.860 --> 52:16.060
They're a team of distro hoppers and Linux hardware nerds.

52:16.060 --> 52:17.520
Everything they do goes back to love

52:17.520 --> 52:18.900
for the Linux community.

52:18.900 --> 52:20.840
Some of their key tooling includes Ruby on Rails

52:20.840 --> 52:24.780
for web development and Flutter for mobile and desktop.

52:24.780 --> 52:27.660
Yeah, yeah, that includes the Linux desktop.

52:27.660 --> 52:29.760
They've pioneered some of the most complex Flutter apps

52:29.760 --> 52:32.660
ever built and they're shipping globally.

52:32.660 --> 52:34.740
They have integrated machine learning and image recognition

52:34.740 --> 52:36.500
at the back end of these Flutter apps.

52:36.500 --> 52:37.780
They really know their stuff

52:37.780 --> 52:39.180
and I think they're pretty excited

52:39.180 --> 52:41.060
about where this all is going.

52:41.060 --> 52:43.980
With Flutter, Entropy rapidly builds apps for iOS,

52:43.980 --> 52:46.660
for Android and for the desktop platforms

52:46.660 --> 52:50.580
like Windows and Mac OS and of course, the Linux desktop.

52:50.580 --> 52:52.180
And they can do it in no time.

52:52.180 --> 52:54.180
In fact, they're already one of the global leaders

52:54.180 --> 52:56.300
in Flutter development with dozens of deployments

52:56.300 --> 52:58.180
in the last year alone.

52:58.180 --> 53:00.780
So, if you're thinking of taking the plunge

53:00.780 --> 53:03.040
into Flutter for Linux, maybe for Linux desktop

53:03.040 --> 53:04.340
or for the other platforms,

53:04.340 --> 53:05.740
or if you're a small or large business

53:05.740 --> 53:06.980
that just wanna get into the game

53:06.980 --> 53:09.540
with an outstanding app on any number of platforms,

53:09.540 --> 53:11.500
Entropy is always ready for a chat.

53:11.500 --> 53:12.980
They love to discuss your ideas

53:12.980 --> 53:14.580
and they'll just share their opinions with you

53:14.580 --> 53:17.500
even if that doesn't necessarily develop into a project.

53:17.500 --> 53:19.900
Just get in touch and chat mobile, Flutter

53:19.900 --> 53:22.540
or even ask them about their latest favorite distro.

53:22.540 --> 53:24.200
They love all that stuff.

53:24.200 --> 53:26.660
So, to get started, Entropy is offering listeners

53:26.660 --> 53:29.820
of Linux Unplugged 15% off their first project.

53:29.820 --> 53:32.980
A mobile app, a web app or, yeah, build a Linux app,

53:32.980 --> 53:35.000
anything, you'll get 15% off.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.460
Use the promo code LUP13.

53:36.460 --> 53:39.380
Just head to linux.entropy.works,

53:39.380 --> 53:42.180
fill out the contact form, use promo code LUP13

53:42.180 --> 53:44.980
and they'll get in touch and there's never any pressure.

53:44.980 --> 53:47.600
They're always happy to just discuss your project,

53:47.600 --> 53:50.020
chat about Linux or maybe even chat about

53:50.020 --> 53:51.460
your favorite Linux podcast.

53:52.420 --> 53:57.220
That's linux.entropy.works, promo code LUP13

53:57.220 --> 53:59.660
and a big thank you to Entropy for coming on here,

53:59.660 --> 54:02.980
being part of the community and helping us all shop locally

54:02.980 --> 54:04.220
for our app development.

54:04.220 --> 54:08.420
linux.entropy.works, promo code LUP13.

54:11.680 --> 54:15.800
Well, speaking of Flutter, we've had some feedback.

54:15.800 --> 54:18.140
Mr. Light fixture wrote back in,

54:18.140 --> 54:19.980
Hello, Chris and Wes.

54:19.980 --> 54:22.300
My initial response to Flutter as a whole

54:22.300 --> 54:26.900
had kind of been, oh great, another one of these.

54:26.900 --> 54:30.020
But as time goes on, I'm warming up to the idea

54:30.020 --> 54:34.100
of a ubiquitous cross-platform toolkit for designing apps

54:34.100 --> 54:36.540
that isn't dependent on the browser.

54:36.540 --> 54:38.900
Because yeah, definitely better than Electron

54:38.900 --> 54:40.760
and that whole mess.

54:41.780 --> 54:45.200
My first time hearing about Fuchsia, I was skeptical.

54:45.200 --> 54:48.260
The discourse at the time was about replacing Linux

54:48.260 --> 54:50.580
as a new developer darling.

54:50.580 --> 54:53.580
And so I sort of went on thinking about Zircon

54:53.580 --> 54:57.380
as how it would stack up directly against Linux.

54:57.380 --> 54:59.060
For a long time, I thought of it like,

54:59.060 --> 55:01.700
well, how could the Zircon kernel possibly catch up

55:01.700 --> 55:03.180
with the software integrations

55:03.180 --> 55:06.540
and the hardware compatibility in Linux?

55:06.540 --> 55:09.140
I mean, enough to supplant it anyway.

55:09.140 --> 55:11.500
But as you said on the show,

55:11.500 --> 55:13.580
they don't really have the same goals.

55:13.580 --> 55:16.740
Linux kind of tries to be everything for everyone.

55:16.740 --> 55:19.740
Zircon was never really meant to be a drop-in replacement.

55:19.740 --> 55:22.260
It has no intention of supporting everything

55:22.260 --> 55:24.020
that Linux supports.

55:24.020 --> 55:27.820
So while this new platform diverting developer time

55:27.820 --> 55:32.700
at large companies away from Linux is definitely a shame,

55:32.700 --> 55:33.860
I'm not sure I see a future

55:33.860 --> 55:37.420
where Linux will ever really be neglected.

55:37.420 --> 55:38.700
If things continue like this,

55:38.700 --> 55:42.380
Linux's quality of trying to be everything for everyone,

55:42.380 --> 55:45.860
I think, is almost guaranteed to have developers

55:45.860 --> 55:49.220
far in the future motivated to keep it alive

55:49.220 --> 55:52.100
because it'll be the only thing that does support

55:52.100 --> 55:54.920
all this esoteric stuff that just isn't profitable

55:54.920 --> 55:57.620
for the other big platforms to maintain.

55:57.620 --> 56:00.020
In the past, many technologies have died

56:00.020 --> 56:03.140
because they lost or maybe never had a common thread

56:03.140 --> 56:07.340
from which to maintain compatibility with what came after.

56:07.340 --> 56:09.600
But today, I think we're assured in a way

56:09.600 --> 56:12.980
that we'll still be able to support so many things

56:12.980 --> 56:15.060
as long as we still have Linux.

56:15.060 --> 56:17.660
Yeah, I've been shifting my opinion on this too, Wes.

56:17.660 --> 56:20.060
Mr. Lightfixer points out that,

56:20.060 --> 56:21.100
like we talked about last week,

56:21.100 --> 56:23.060
we kind of started kind of skeptical

56:23.060 --> 56:24.100
and have started to shift,

56:24.100 --> 56:26.340
and part of it was when we were playing with Fuchsia.

56:26.340 --> 56:27.460
But the other part that honestly

56:27.460 --> 56:28.780
made a pretty big impact on me,

56:28.780 --> 56:32.340
and I think it's telling, is I tried it myself.

56:32.340 --> 56:36.120
And I think that probably had trying Flutter

56:36.120 --> 56:39.420
and building a stupid little hello world app

56:39.420 --> 56:43.060
made me realize, oh man, if people had access to this,

56:43.060 --> 56:44.560
we could actually get some pretty good,

56:44.560 --> 56:47.940
pretty quick applications that weren't all Electron.

56:47.940 --> 56:51.420
And that I think is like the underlying thing

56:51.420 --> 56:52.700
that was really motivating me.

56:52.700 --> 56:54.540
And I don't actually still feel like Flutter

56:54.540 --> 56:57.840
is a perfect solution because some of the things

56:57.840 --> 57:00.180
that it relies on are getting a little long in the tooth.

57:00.180 --> 57:03.380
However, that seems like a solvable problem to me.

57:03.380 --> 57:06.460
And the fact that you have Google and Canonical behind it,

57:06.460 --> 57:08.300
it makes me reflect on that conversation we had

57:08.300 --> 57:09.740
with the Lutris developer.

57:09.740 --> 57:12.760
And you recall he said, for a little while,

57:12.760 --> 57:14.220
it was like Canonical was really leading

57:14.220 --> 57:15.540
with the Linux desktop.

57:15.540 --> 57:16.980
And so you just kind of followed what they did

57:16.980 --> 57:18.460
when Unity was kind of at its peak

57:18.460 --> 57:21.440
and developers didn't really know how to come into Linux.

57:21.440 --> 57:23.100
But I remember I'd have these conversations with Mike

57:23.100 --> 57:24.380
from Coder Radio too.

57:24.380 --> 57:25.860
You know, you could kind of look at what Canonical

57:25.860 --> 57:29.020
was doing design-wise with Unity and take clues from that.

57:29.020 --> 57:31.100
We kind of lost that recently.

57:31.100 --> 57:35.300
And he's still like in that mindset, the Lutris developer,

57:35.300 --> 57:36.360
he didn't know where to go from here.

57:36.360 --> 57:39.580
And I thought perhaps we're seeing Canonical recapture

57:39.580 --> 57:41.060
a little bit of that mindset and a little bit

57:41.060 --> 57:42.460
of that direction with their announcement

57:42.460 --> 57:43.900
and endorsement of Flutter.

57:43.900 --> 57:46.200
And then when I was talking with Entropy

57:46.200 --> 57:49.400
about the applications they've been building in Flutter,

57:49.400 --> 57:50.940
I started to realize like they're actually

57:50.940 --> 57:53.700
like building custom apps for businesses

57:53.700 --> 57:55.940
that want to like to have some data workload or something.

57:55.940 --> 57:57.300
Like it, maybe it might be, in this case,

57:57.300 --> 57:59.620
it was machine learning and image recognition.

57:59.620 --> 58:02.220
And they want to be able to run it on Mac, Windows and Linux

58:02.220 --> 58:04.900
because they have all three in their environment.

58:04.900 --> 58:07.260
That's not a necessarily uncommon thing.

58:07.260 --> 58:11.500
Like that could be a scenario that's kind of common

58:11.500 --> 58:12.340
in the enterprise environment.

58:12.340 --> 58:14.820
You've got multiple, multiple OSs.

58:14.820 --> 58:15.960
Maybe it's just Mac and Windows,

58:15.960 --> 58:17.860
or maybe it's just Windows and Linux.

58:17.860 --> 58:19.460
And you've got mobile in there too.

58:19.460 --> 58:20.740
And you want to create something

58:20.740 --> 58:23.420
that's essentially native on each platform.

58:23.420 --> 58:24.540
You look at your options out there.

58:24.540 --> 58:27.640
You've got Electron, but I don't know.

58:27.640 --> 58:29.540
I feel like things are awkward in Electron world.

58:29.540 --> 58:30.900
Microsoft seems to be in love

58:30.900 --> 58:33.360
with their edge powered web view thing.

58:33.360 --> 58:35.780
And I'm kind of done with Electron apps.

58:35.780 --> 58:38.140
I have been tolerant for a long time,

58:38.140 --> 58:40.820
but I'm kind of ready to have something smaller,

58:40.820 --> 58:43.640
faster and lighter and something more approachable.

58:43.640 --> 58:45.740
So I agree with Mr. Light fixture.

58:45.740 --> 58:47.680
I think it's worth reconsidering.

58:47.680 --> 58:48.520
No, I think you're right.

58:48.520 --> 58:49.780
I mean, there has been this question of,

58:49.780 --> 58:52.980
well, you want to make a desktop Linux app,

58:52.980 --> 58:53.860
how do you do it?

58:53.860 --> 58:55.220
There are a lot of options.

58:55.220 --> 58:57.500
It's hard to feel a sense of any momentum

58:57.500 --> 58:59.300
in one particular area.

58:59.300 --> 59:01.020
And then you're going to have to go dive into that thing.

59:01.020 --> 59:03.100
Maybe it should decay, you're going the cute route

59:03.100 --> 59:05.740
and figure out how do I make cross compatibility work

59:05.740 --> 59:07.940
and which versions do I target and how do I get it to run?

59:07.940 --> 59:10.440
And Flutter has a lot of answers there.

59:10.440 --> 59:12.500
And yeah, there are probably a lot of old timers

59:12.500 --> 59:14.420
or traditionalists out there,

59:14.420 --> 59:15.740
to some extent, myself included

59:15.740 --> 59:17.620
that view it with some skepticism,

59:17.620 --> 59:20.300
especially because of the big names involved.

59:20.300 --> 59:23.940
But if there does sprout a legitimate community

59:23.940 --> 59:26.380
of open source users developing apps,

59:26.380 --> 59:29.380
and if it makes these apps available on Linux,

59:29.380 --> 59:31.300
I think it could be quite the pragmatic win.

59:31.300 --> 59:32.900
Something has to give.

59:32.900 --> 59:34.700
I look at what Microsoft is doing

59:34.700 --> 59:38.060
and they've opened the floodgates for the Windows App Store.

59:38.060 --> 59:41.260
Any app, any payment model, any way you've built it,

59:41.260 --> 59:44.900
you can sell it now in the Windows App Store in Windows 11.

59:44.900 --> 59:48.380
And then I look at the Apple model and it's not as open,

59:48.380 --> 59:50.820
but it's if you want to build an app for the iPad

59:50.820 --> 59:52.740
and the iPhone, you can also now ship it on the Mac

59:52.740 --> 59:54.780
and you can run iPhone apps on the Mac.

59:54.780 --> 59:56.900
And so it opens up for developers

59:56.900 --> 59:58.900
when you're looking at potential customers with wallets,

59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.620
it opens it up to a lot of customers.

01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.900
They don't really see anything that really enables that

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:05.380
for Linux right now,

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:08.420
without some sort of enabling technology like Flutter.

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.140
I'm curious, Wimpy, if you have thoughts,

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:11.980
maybe I'm way off on this topic.

01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:16.420
Yeah, obviously I was involved in the early sort of stages

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:20.860
of Canonical working with Google on Flutter.

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:24.300
And a lot of what you're saying is obviously very true.

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:27.740
Flutter is the fastest growing developer platform right now.

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:32.380
And it provides an opportunity to deliver

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:36.420
a developer experience on the Linux desktop

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:40.540
that has a lot of developer traction behind it

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:41.700
and a lot of interest.

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:46.700
And I think it will become what Electron has become.

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:50.980
Electron has been a great equalizer.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:55.020
I mean, you were just saying that you're over Electron,

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:58.780
but because of Electron, we have a lot of applications

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.980
on Linux that we wouldn't have had

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.740
were it not for that cross-platform compatibility

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:05.580
that it provides,

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:08.580
even though it requires some sort of heavy lifting.

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:13.580
Even things like Steam are based on Ceph for all of the UI,

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:16.300
which is the forerunner to Electron

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.980
and Spotify uses Ceph as well.

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:23.580
And love it or hate it, big brand apps like Slack

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.500
and what have you and Discord

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.340
have enabled computing parity on the desktop

01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:31.740
that we've not had for a long, long time.

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:36.100
And I think Flutter will be the extension of that

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.420
because there are so many large organizations

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:40.260
building their apps in Flutter now,

01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:42.060
and they can build their apps in Flutter

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:45.260
for mobile and desktop and web.

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:49.380
And I think Linux will continue to see fair treatment

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:50.220
as a result.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:51.260
We have seen more games

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:53.180
when game engines support multiple platforms

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:55.740
and we've seen more apps as Electron has come around,

01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:58.140
but Popeye, I'm curious if you think

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:00.800
maybe we're trading one evil master for another,

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:01.900
because it's always possible

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:04.200
that Microsoft whips Electron into shape

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.520
with their edge rendering engine,

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.420
and maybe they'd be a better overlord

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:09.860
than Google is with Flutter.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:12.100
I think it's not unreasonable to hedge our bets

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:14.980
and diversify a little bit.

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.420
We have toolkits ourselves.

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.580
We've got GTK, we've got Qt,

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:23.160
we've got others to develop our own things.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.780
And yeah, I don't think it's unreasonable

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:29.380
to welcome these other, as you say,

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:32.820
corporate overlords at arm's length at all

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:35.100
and make it possible for developers.

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:38.740
Like Martin said, these technologies are popular,

01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:40.340
insanely popular.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:45.340
And I think it's rather blinkered not to open the door

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:49.540
to have those technologies enabled on the Linux desktop

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:52.500
because if we don't, then we will continue to be

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:55.480
an also-ran and we will continue to have no-killer apps

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.460
for the desktop, because right now we don't have any,

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:03.460
and we don't have robust professional toolkits

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.420
to enable people to develop them, in my mind.

01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.060
And I don't think it's gonna take away

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:10.800
from a native GTK application, if you will,

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.780
or a Qt application, because the developer

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:16.060
that's gonna choose Flutter or Electron

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:19.140
likely was never gonna choose those other toolkits,

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:21.420
simply because of the requirements of the application.

01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:25.100
Maybe, that's, I mean, without speaking to each developer,

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.380
I mean, you can certainly surmise that.

01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:31.060
It's not an unreasonable and outrageous accusation to make

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:33.380
that someone probably would choose a technology

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.420
that's backed by a very large company

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:38.520
with a lot of comprehensive developer documentation

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.740
and mindshare and developer advocates

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.460
over something that's been around for 20 years

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:48.460
and keeps changing and is not well-documented

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:50.180
and there isn't a huge community.

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:53.180
And by the word huge, I mean different

01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:56.480
from the size of the Linux community, like much larger.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.900
So I don't think it's an unreasonable suggestion

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:01.700
to make that people would go for those technologies,

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:04.420
just the same as developers went for Electron,

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:09.420
because it was quick and easy to bootstrap up an application.

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.120
Okay, negatives aside, it was quick and easy

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.400
for people to get started.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.980
Yeah, really, I mean, I do back-end development mostly,

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:18.620
some web development and I know not that much

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:20.120
except as a Linux desktop user

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.260
and Electron is the thing I've used

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:23.620
to make handy tools for myself

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.140
and I could see Flutter really being that

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:28.220
because there's not a ton of money in desktop Linux.

01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:30.600
I can't take the time to become an expert in doing that

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.620
unless I want it to be my main hobby.

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.180
But if there are tools that are well-supported

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:37.020
that let me leverage what developer time I have

01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:39.620
and also get it on the Linux desktop,

01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:41.220
that seems like a nice tool.

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:44.860
We wanna get your emails, your feedback,

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:46.460
let us know what you think on any topic

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:50.520
or what you'd like us to cover, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.860
Last week you asked us about Landlock and we responded

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:55.340
and that coverage is in this week's Linux Action News,

01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:59.600
along with our thoughts on the situation around Audacity

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.260
and several other stories in the world of Linux this week

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:03.860
at linuxactionnews.com.

01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:06.600
So really in this, I just wanted to say, just the basics,

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.860
we'd love to hear from you at our contact page.

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:09.980
We have the Telegram group

01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:11.420
where the conversation's going all the time,

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:13.740
jupyterbroadcasting.com slash telegram.

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.900
And last but not least, the Luplug.

01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:17.660
I popped in there for a little bit last Sunday

01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:19.180
as I was out for a walk.

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:20.700
We had a great conversation in there

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.980
and the Luplug goes every single Sunday at noon Pacific.

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:25.460
We have it on the calendar that gets converted

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:28.340
to your local time at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:30.420
And if you'd like to join our Mumble Room,

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.820
get in the conversation as they're happening,

01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.540
we have information for our Mumble Room

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:37.460
at linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:40.060
The show's live on Tuesdays at noon Pacific

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:42.480
and that's also at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.580
to get converted in your local time.

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:49.900
Well, earlier Neil mentioned the CentOS

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:52.580
special interest group for hyperscalers

01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.960
and we wanted to follow up on that a bit

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.540
here in the pick section.

01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:59.340
Davida Kavelka of Facebook

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:02.940
presented at this year's CentOS Dojo at Fosdom

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:04.780
all about this SIG's efforts,

01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:06.180
why it's being founded,

01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:08.820
and why Facebook wanted to get involved.

01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:10.300
CentOS runs everywhere at Facebook.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.660
It runs on all hosts and all the containers.

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:16.020
75% of the fleet as of yesterday morning

01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:18.980
is currently running on CentOS stream eight.

01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:20.300
The rest is running on CentOS seven

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:23.180
and is in the course of getting updated.

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:26.780
We use CentOS as a stable base.

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:29.940
And then for components that we want to track more quickly,

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:32.900
we take backwards and we update them as needed.

01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:35.340
So for example, we do a lot of work internally with systemd.

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:37.940
So for systemd, we will have an internal backward

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:39.760
that we maintain that tracks systemd master

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:40.940
and that we deploy.

01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:42.340
We also use things like Apple

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:43.860
to get access to packages from Fedora

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:46.700
and we contribute to Apple when needed.

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:48.460
We don't run the right kernel.

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:50.960
We run the upstream kernel from Linus

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:53.800
with our internal configuration for our hardware

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.340
and our kernel folks try to contribute

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.700
to the upstream kernel directly as much as possible.

01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.800
That's a lot of CentOS servers running at Facebook.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.980
And so we put this in the pick this week

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:03.980
to just kind of keep this episode on a theme

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:06.140
because now it's beginning to look like

01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:08.060
there's something to at least keep an eye on,

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.780
maybe grab an ISO soon.

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:11.780
This is an interesting problem that Facebook had.

01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:14.300
They were taking CentOS and then essentially slapping in

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:18.220
a kernel from Linus, some back ports from Fedora

01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:21.020
and trying to get it really modern.

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:22.660
They were essentially solving the problem

01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:24.580
I was trying to solve when I switched to Gentoo

01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:28.120
in frustration over a decade ago in the enterprise.

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.040
It's funny, it hasn't really been solved yet.

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.440
But now with the way that CentOS is being built

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.700
and the way it's being composed,

01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:36.540
there's kind of an opportunity here for different groups

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:39.220
to build up these alternative ideas

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:42.320
that maybe get adopted, maybe they never do.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:45.740
But the CentOS hyperscaler effort is building a CentOS

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:48.800
with faster moving packages, some back ports in there.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.380
We're mentioning it this week because ISOs are out,

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.740
but we're keeping an eye on it long-term

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.940
as a possible workstation here in the studio.

01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:59.020
So we'll let you know, we have a link in the show notes

01:07:59.020 --> 01:07:59.940
for information about that.

01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:02.560
I say at this phase, keep an eye on it, see where it goes.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.380
It's pretty neat to see a version of CentOS

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.260
that maybe has some more current stuff in it,

01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:07.900
could kind of sit in that sweet spot,

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.460
especially with the plasma desktop.

01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:12.060
If you'd like to get ahold of us on Twitter,

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:14.220
this show is at Linux Unplugged.

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:17.340
The whole network is on Twitter at Jupiter Signal.

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:21.500
And the entire network is at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.500
We got a website now, Wes, brand new.

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:26.560
Fancy, I think there might even be SSL.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.140
Oh gosh, I don't know about that.

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:30.900
I think it's just a fad, so I didn't bother.

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:34.200
Instead, we're just doing all of our stuff over HTTP forever.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.020
Send us your PGP keys and we'll get back to you

01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:38.460
with a signed MP3 in a couple of days.

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:40.100
Yeah, good enough, good enough.

01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:42.780
Also, join us live, we're here every Tuesday.

01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:46.720
See you next week, same bad time, same bad station.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.060
And of course, if you haven't caught Linux Action News,

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:52.260
you gotta go check it out this week.

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:53.740
More stories, stuff that before the show,

01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:55.420
people are like, are you gonna talk about this?

01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:57.620
No, we already talked about it in Linux Action News.

01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:59.740
We already talked about it, so go check that out.

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:01.160
Links to everything we talked about today

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:04.980
over at linuxunplugged.com slash 413,

01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:07.420
including our mumble room, our contact page,

01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:08.780
our subscriptions if you wanna get

01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:10.960
in your podcast catcher of choice.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.060
All of that's over there at the Linux Unplugged website,

01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:14.840
another website.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.520
You know, they're just cropping up everywhere.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.180
Somebody's gonna need to build some sort of way

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:20.660
we can find them all.

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:22.400
Anyways, thanks so much for joining us.

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.540
See you right back here next Tuesday.

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:40.540
We'll be right back with a new episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:09:40.540 --> 01:10:04.420
ChibiTitles.com, let's go boat.

01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:06.460
Let's pick a title for this thing.

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:08.740
Conversations continuing on in the chat room.

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:10.780
I hope it hasn't devolved in the chat room to the point

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:14.520
where we can't have an open, transparent conversation

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.360
on the show.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.160
That would be a shame, but perhaps.

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.900
Dildan, I know you had a point you wanted to make

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:24.140
about Maui Plus and.NET, or Maui and.NET,

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:25.900
maybe being a contender to Flutter?

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:28.620
Yeah, it's a multi-platform app UI.

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:33.620
It's an evolution of Xamarin using all the native toolkits.

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:37.140
Does this mean I can have Tomboy back for my notes?

01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:37.960
Possibly.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:41.900
I missed some of those.NET applications.

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:42.740
What was it?

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.060
What was the one called?

01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:44.900
Banshee.

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:45.740
Banshee, yes.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.980
Banshee was a great music player.

01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:52.980
Even today, I pulled it out with just a week or two ago

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:57.740
because I got the nostalgia goggles and it is still,

01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:00.640
I think, the best jukebox that I've ever used.

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:02.160
Yeah, I loved it.

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:05.780
I actually was so happy with a lot of those early.NET apps

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:10.300
and I never really quite agreed with all the mono hate,

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:13.220
but I did understand the uncomfortable position

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:15.660
and with all of the IP crap that was going on back then.

01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:16.500
So you gotta remember,

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.460
that stuff was really in the air back then.

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:21.140
I understand why it went down the way it did.

01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:23.220
And it makes me wonder if there isn't just

01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.420
some built-in resistance to Maui

01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:28.740
and just.NET apps in general still on Linux.

01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:31.980
Well, at least with Maui, the main complaint people have

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:34.780
is that it steals the name from another toolkit

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:36.140
that already exists.

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:38.060
Right, right, yeah, there's that too.

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:40.140
You know, there's a lot of names out there, it's hard.

01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:41.420
They could have picked a better name.

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:43.180
It's not like they don't have an army of lawyers

01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:44.380
to figure this stuff out.

01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:45.500
Right, and a search engine

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:46.740
to just do a kind of a quick check.

01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:50.140
Right, like before Microsoft announced it

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:54.940
being called Maui, the original Maui from the KDE project

01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:57.860
was the top result and now it is not.

01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.720
I know how they feel.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.780
There's a group out there that have stolen my name

01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:06.940
and they know who they are and I'm still salty about it.
