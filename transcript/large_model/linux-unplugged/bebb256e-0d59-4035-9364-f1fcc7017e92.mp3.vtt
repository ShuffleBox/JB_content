WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Have you noticed how just about every Linux news outlet

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
is talking about Microsoft CBL Mariner distro?

00:06.000 --> 00:08.160
All at the same time right now.

00:08.160 --> 00:10.680
Just going by my feeds, and I even,

00:10.680 --> 00:12.880
I'll put a link in the show notes to prove it,

00:12.880 --> 00:15.960
I've literally counted a dozen stories written

00:15.960 --> 00:19.880
in the past week-ish about CBL Mariner,

00:19.880 --> 00:22.000
which is, I don't know, it's funny, I guess,

00:22.000 --> 00:24.120
because I thought everybody knew about this.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.240
I mean, clearly, clearly a few people

00:26.240 --> 00:28.480
must have missed Linux Action News Win 86,

00:28.480 --> 00:30.920
because that was back in April we talked about this thing.

00:30.920 --> 00:33.320
I think so, okay, a quick recap.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.600
Microsoft's distro is called CBL Mariner.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.760
Kind of a strange name, but CBL stands for Common Base Linux.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.440
Clearly, they weren't trying to market this thing

00:42.440 --> 00:44.320
outside of Microsoft.

00:44.320 --> 00:45.920
I guess they use it for all kinds of stuff,

00:45.920 --> 00:49.840
but including containers in Azure's Kubernetes service.

00:49.840 --> 00:52.760
And now, it's part of that secret sauce

00:52.760 --> 00:55.480
making the GUI work on WSL.

00:55.480 --> 00:56.320
Gee.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.320
Yeah, it's got all the bits in there

00:57.320 --> 00:58.760
to make a base Linux system work.

00:58.760 --> 01:01.360
Yeah, PulseAudio, Wayland, woo.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.360
Yeah, it does Wayland, isn't that funny?

01:03.360 --> 01:04.200
What?

01:04.200 --> 01:06.160
Yeah, we kind of broke it down in Linux Action News,

01:06.160 --> 01:08.800
so you can check it out in episode 186.

01:08.800 --> 01:12.600
And it's really Microsoft's just middle layer Linux.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.040
They originally got it started in Azure,

01:14.040 --> 01:17.000
and now they're using a custom RDP virtual channel,

01:17.000 --> 01:18.960
using the RDP protocol,

01:18.960 --> 01:22.640
and it talks to the Mariner's Western RDP server,

01:22.640 --> 01:26.600
and it does the communications for the graphics,

01:26.600 --> 01:28.360
for the video stuff, using Wayland,

01:28.360 --> 01:31.440
and it uses PulseAudio to create an audio channel

01:31.440 --> 01:33.640
that goes over that RDP connection,

01:33.640 --> 01:35.600
which goes back to the Windows client,

01:35.600 --> 01:37.040
running on the desktop.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.000
And this is just something

01:38.000 --> 01:40.280
that the Microsoft Linux engineers created,

01:40.280 --> 01:42.560
so that way they have this middle layer here

01:42.560 --> 01:44.760
to do this stuff for their Edge devices

01:44.760 --> 01:47.480
and their cloud devices, and now for WSLG.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.560
It is public, and of course, it's up on their GitHub,

01:49.560 --> 01:52.040
but there's no official ready-to-go builds.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.080
There are some tutorials you can find.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.680
But interestingly, Wes,

01:55.680 --> 01:57.720
did you know that CBL makes use of RPMs?

01:57.720 --> 01:59.960
It's got tiny DNF for package management.

01:59.960 --> 02:01.120
Is that right?

02:01.120 --> 02:01.960
Yep.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.560
This really is one of those situations with Linux

02:03.560 --> 02:07.960
where anyone can make it useful, even Microsoft.

02:07.960 --> 02:12.960
Hello, friends, and welcome back

02:17.280 --> 02:18.600
to your weekly Linux talk show.

02:18.600 --> 02:19.440
My name is Chris.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.280
My name is Wes.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.520
Hello, Wes.

02:21.520 --> 02:22.680
I see you brought the Pops with you.

02:22.680 --> 02:23.680
I sure did.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.280
We got some show dogs today.

02:25.280 --> 02:26.440
This episode is brought to you

02:26.440 --> 02:27.600
by the all-new A Cloud Guru,

02:27.600 --> 02:29.120
the leader in learning for the cloud, Linux,

02:29.120 --> 02:30.200
and other modern tech skills.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.000
You know, they got hundreds of courses,

02:32.000 --> 02:34.520
thousands of hands-on labs.

02:34.520 --> 02:35.680
So get certified, get hired,

02:35.680 --> 02:38.920
get learning at acloudguru.com.

02:38.920 --> 02:42.160
Well, we got a big episode in 4.15.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.520
You know, of course, probably everybody's wondering

02:44.520 --> 02:47.200
if we're gonna talk about Valve's Steam Deck.

02:47.200 --> 02:51.040
Yes, this week, if you hadn't heard, somehow,

02:51.040 --> 02:56.040
Valve announced a Linux-powered handheld device.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.480
It's a handheld high-powered gaming device

02:58.480 --> 03:00.520
that lets you take your Steam library with you

03:00.520 --> 03:01.880
wherever you are.

03:01.880 --> 03:04.120
It's got a beautiful seven-inch display,

03:04.120 --> 03:05.960
ergonomic controls that are really built

03:05.960 --> 03:07.840
for long play sessions,

03:07.840 --> 03:10.720
and a new look for Steam designed for Steam Deck.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.320
You can think about Steam Deck like a portable gaming PC

03:13.320 --> 03:15.120
with built-in controllers.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.400
We have, like, a million thoughts around this.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.480
There's so much to talk about.

03:19.480 --> 03:24.480
And there may be a turd floating in this party punch bowl,

03:24.680 --> 03:26.720
a prolific Linux game porter.

03:26.720 --> 03:29.480
Ethan Lee is gonna join us later in the show.

03:29.480 --> 03:30.520
And he's gonna shed light

03:30.520 --> 03:32.640
on maybe some of the negative ramifications

03:32.640 --> 03:35.880
around Valve's effort for the Deck,

03:35.880 --> 03:37.920
the way they're communicating and messaging to developers,

03:37.920 --> 03:40.720
and what could be a negative

03:40.720 --> 03:42.800
for the future native Linux games.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.880
Ironically, the Deck may actually be bad news

03:45.880 --> 03:47.920
for Linux gaming in some ways.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.200
We're gonna get to all of that.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.600
But first, we really should say

03:51.600 --> 03:54.200
time-appropriate greetings to our virtual love.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.240
Hello, Mumble Room!

03:55.240 --> 03:57.280
Hello. Hello, Mumble Room.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.840
Hello, Mumble Room.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.320
Hello, everybody.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.480
You know, this is kind of special.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.160
I realized I looked at the calendar,

04:04.160 --> 04:06.280
and I said, holy crap, Wes,

04:06.280 --> 04:09.400
we've got three episodes left before I hit the road

04:09.400 --> 04:11.080
and start heading towards Salt Lake City.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.520
How is that happening?

04:12.520 --> 04:14.200
Where did the time go?

04:14.200 --> 04:15.040
I don't know.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.040
We better start making plans.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.040
Should have made those plans a while ago, I think.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.920
Yeah, yeah, I know, right?

04:20.920 --> 04:23.600
I mean, right now, I've been so focused

04:23.600 --> 04:26.240
on getting Lady Joops ready for the road,

04:26.240 --> 04:27.560
because she's gotta be a home.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.520
She's gonna have to be a production shop.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.320
I mean, literally going from the roof down to the axles,

04:32.320 --> 04:33.400
getting her ready to go,

04:33.400 --> 04:36.120
because it's gonna be like a 5,000-mile journey,

04:36.120 --> 04:38.920
and it's mostly over the Cascades and the Rockies.

04:38.920 --> 04:41.000
Just a few mountains in the way.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.120
Oh, my gosh.

04:42.120 --> 04:45.400
So we kind of have something special

04:45.400 --> 04:48.800
that is happening on the road trip.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.040
Uncle Brent is gonna join us.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.600
The kids, Hadeah and I,

04:52.600 --> 04:54.800
Brent's gonna be on Lady Joops,

04:54.800 --> 04:58.360
capturing the trip, capturing bits and moments

04:58.360 --> 05:00.800
that we're gonna shape into content

05:00.800 --> 05:02.120
for future exclusive releases

05:02.120 --> 05:03.760
after we get back from the road trip.

05:03.760 --> 05:04.800
Now, that sounds great,

05:04.800 --> 05:07.520
and obviously, Brent's a great fit for that.

05:07.520 --> 05:08.680
I'd like to know,

05:08.680 --> 05:11.360
are you gonna teach him how to drive the rig?

05:11.360 --> 05:12.760
Oh, you know what?

05:12.760 --> 05:14.520
I hadn't thought about that.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.920
There's very few people I would be willing

05:16.920 --> 05:18.680
to let drive Lady Joops.

05:18.680 --> 05:20.120
Rightly so, I mean, it's your home.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.360
And Brent is one of them.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.280
He is a terrific driver.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.160
I have co-piloted with Brent before,

05:25.160 --> 05:26.920
and I have seen him in action.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.760
It definitely would take some training,

05:28.760 --> 05:31.040
but one of the things he'll probably do is,

05:31.040 --> 05:34.240
if he wants, is we're gonna have a chase vehicle.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.720
We thought about towing it,

05:35.720 --> 05:37.760
but with two other adults on board,

05:37.760 --> 05:39.360
we think we're gonna do the chase thing

05:39.360 --> 05:41.720
where we'll have another car with us,

05:41.720 --> 05:45.280
and Brent can go and have his private time in that car.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.360
He can listen to his audiobooks and his podcasts

05:47.360 --> 05:49.320
and be on his own.

05:49.320 --> 05:50.160
His own playlist.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.840
For most of the day, if he wants.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.160
And the nice thing about co-piloting,

05:55.160 --> 05:57.760
or co-driving like that, is we both have radios.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.560
So even if we don't have cell signal,

05:59.560 --> 06:01.680
we can still quickly communicate with each other.

06:01.680 --> 06:04.280
And if I see an obstruction on the road up ahead,

06:04.280 --> 06:05.720
I can call back to him and I can say,

06:05.720 --> 06:07.000
Brent, can you make me a hole?

06:07.000 --> 06:10.160
And Brent will move over and block the oncoming traffic

06:10.160 --> 06:11.720
so that way I can get chupes over

06:11.720 --> 06:14.520
and then get back and going again.

06:14.520 --> 06:15.760
So it's really nice to have,

06:15.760 --> 06:18.360
or he can go and scout a gas station before I-

06:18.360 --> 06:20.240
Right, go find some good landing spots for us.

06:20.240 --> 06:21.680
And report back to the mothership.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.640
And then when I get in range, he can radio me

06:23.640 --> 06:25.360
and tell me, okay, you're looking good.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.800
This is what Hadi and I do, too.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.760
So that's extremely useful.

06:28.760 --> 06:32.200
Or he could just ride along board and just chill out.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.840
It's a nice view up front.

06:33.840 --> 06:37.280
But the fun idea that we had was,

06:37.280 --> 06:38.640
this seems like a great opportunity

06:38.640 --> 06:41.800
to make some really fun content, some exclusive stuff,

06:41.800 --> 06:43.680
because along this road trip,

06:43.680 --> 06:44.880
not only are we gonna be meeting up

06:44.880 --> 06:47.360
with Jupiter Broadcasting audience members,

06:47.360 --> 06:50.000
but we're gonna be meeting up with team members,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.800
members of the crew, and capturing those moments.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.480
We haven't seen each other for a very long time.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.920
It was a whole other world last time.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.720
We have some friends that have been on the show before

06:59.720 --> 07:01.920
that we're gonna be seeing along the way.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.680
And then when we get to Salt Lake City,

07:04.680 --> 07:06.840
we're gonna do an official meetup there.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.160
We have some swag planned.

07:08.160 --> 07:09.720
We're gonna have some swag on board juice.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.200
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.040
Yep, yep.

07:12.040 --> 07:12.960
It's the swag tour.

07:12.960 --> 07:13.800
You know, one of the things about

07:13.800 --> 07:16.200
since we went independent is,

07:16.200 --> 07:19.280
we don't have a dedicated designer anymore.

07:19.280 --> 07:20.560
And man, is that tricky.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.280
And Linode stepped up in such a huge way.

07:23.280 --> 07:27.280
They basically just got their design team together for us.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.120
Wow.

07:28.120 --> 07:29.680
And they've created stickers.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.320
They've created stuff to go on the shirt.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.720
We're gonna have some really cool exclusive swag.

07:35.720 --> 07:36.920
Very awesome.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.640
And if we have enough, we'll try to put some

07:38.640 --> 07:39.640
on the garage afterwards.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.240
But they've put together some awesome stickers

07:42.240 --> 07:44.160
of Lady Joups on the road trip.

07:44.160 --> 07:47.640
And they will also be giving away

07:47.640 --> 07:49.160
like a couple of raspberry pies.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.000
Oh, ho, ho.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.160
And doing a few other like raffle giveaways

07:53.160 --> 07:54.280
at the Denver meetup.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.200
So we got some plans.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.000
We've got a couple locations.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.920
I've pinged the meetup group in Salt Lake City

07:59.920 --> 08:01.360
asking them for suggestions.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.240
So if you're in the Salt Lake City area

08:03.240 --> 08:05.000
and you can give us some suggestions on a venue.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.680
You got that local expertise.

08:06.680 --> 08:07.520
I was thinking like,

08:07.520 --> 08:09.680
I mean, maybe we just do like a park with some shade

08:09.680 --> 08:11.920
and we bring some food and some drinks or something.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.240
I mean, we could do that too.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.720
It doesn't have to be anything super fancy or it could be.

08:15.720 --> 08:18.360
So meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

08:18.360 --> 08:20.920
for the two official meetups that are on the books.

08:20.920 --> 08:24.240
But then the plan is I'll have the live tracker with me.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.520
And I'm gonna have a website at colonytracker.live

08:27.520 --> 08:28.640
with a little link on there.

08:28.640 --> 08:29.800
If you wanna do a micro meetup,

08:29.800 --> 08:31.360
that's what I'm calling the live micro meetups.

08:31.360 --> 08:32.640
You hit that little button.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.520
I've created a specific form

08:34.520 --> 08:35.680
that asks you a couple of questions

08:35.680 --> 08:36.880
so we can arrange a meetup.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.440
And that's gonna be all at colonytracker.live.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.360
Your direct link to LadyJubes.

08:41.360 --> 08:42.360
It's getting real close.

08:42.360 --> 08:43.960
I don't know if we're gonna get everything done

08:43.960 --> 08:45.360
in the three weeks.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.600
It's pretty nuts when I think about it.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.360
And then like, I realized Brent's gonna be on board

08:50.360 --> 08:52.000
then he could join me for some of the shows.

08:52.000 --> 08:52.840
Oh yeah.

08:52.840 --> 08:55.880
I need to have like a two host setup in Jubes,

08:55.880 --> 08:57.600
which has traditionally been a single host setup,

08:57.600 --> 08:59.800
which means immediately I'm going to a mixer, right?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.440
Like that's, so that added complication right there.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.480
And last time I looked,

09:03.480 --> 09:07.080
you didn't have a separate sound booth installed in the RV.

09:07.080 --> 09:07.920
Okay, no.

09:07.920 --> 09:08.920
I'm thinking like he'll be in the dinette

09:08.920 --> 09:11.200
and I'll be in the upfront work area or something.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.200
We'll just do a little bit of distance

09:13.200 --> 09:16.800
and then rely on the sound isolation of our mics, I suppose.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.480
But trying to just coordinate all of it together,

09:18.480 --> 09:20.760
we're creating a new sleeping space in LadyJubes too.

09:20.760 --> 09:21.920
So he, you know, has his own spot.

09:21.920 --> 09:22.760
A bread box.

09:22.760 --> 09:23.600
Yep.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.000
And all that stuff.

09:25.000 --> 09:25.840
Very excited.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.560
He'd join us, but he's mid project right now.

09:28.560 --> 09:29.720
So he can't really join us,

09:29.720 --> 09:31.320
but it's all getting really close.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.400
And then we'll be producing some shows on the road.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.360
Of course, as well.

09:34.360 --> 09:37.920
And then Wes is going to meet up with everyone

09:37.920 --> 09:38.840
and all of us in Denver.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.920
And we're going to do a Linux Unplugged in Denver.

09:40.920 --> 09:41.960
From Denver.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.280
I don't know where yet.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.800
We don't actually have a place figured out to record yet.

09:45.800 --> 09:46.640
Stay tuned.

09:46.640 --> 09:48.000
So we got to figure that out.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.960
I don't know how we're going to live stream it,

09:49.960 --> 09:51.120
but we're going to try to do that.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.280
I don't know how we're going to accommodate a mumble room too,

09:53.280 --> 09:54.680
but we're going to try to do that.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.920
I got to figure it all out.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.120
Just a few small details.

09:58.120 --> 09:58.960
And it should be fine.

09:58.960 --> 09:59.960
Cause you're going to get in the night before

09:59.960 --> 10:01.080
and I'm going to get in the day before that.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.000
It's plenty of time to figure this out.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.200
Plenty of time.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.040
Plenty of time.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.040
There should be no interruptions.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.760
However, if the show's a little weird that week,

10:09.760 --> 10:12.760
you know, mid August, the week of the 20th,

10:12.760 --> 10:14.040
you know, so about, you know, the episode,

10:14.040 --> 10:16.520
like on the 17th or 18th, you know,

10:16.520 --> 10:18.560
maybe give us a little latitude on that one.

10:18.560 --> 10:21.840
You know, cause we're going to try our best,

10:21.840 --> 10:23.000
but you never know what's going to happen

10:23.000 --> 10:24.320
when you're kind of throwing it all together.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.160
And if you are in that area and you know of a space

10:26.160 --> 10:27.680
we could use to record for two of us.

10:27.680 --> 10:28.520
Let us know.

10:28.520 --> 10:29.600
Or maybe three, I don't know.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.320
Or maybe, I mean, imagine if a few of our friends should,

10:31.320 --> 10:32.160
maybe more.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.000
It could be something.

10:33.000 --> 10:33.840
What's going to happen?

10:33.840 --> 10:34.680
Who knows?

10:34.680 --> 10:36.200
Stay tuned and find out.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.880
But we do have a lot to get to today,

10:37.880 --> 10:41.360
including our chat with Ethan, which is,

10:41.360 --> 10:43.240
I think it's extremely, extremely important.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.200
It brings, it brings attention to a subject

10:45.200 --> 10:46.840
that is completely getting lost

10:46.840 --> 10:48.400
in the announcement of the deck,

10:48.400 --> 10:50.320
which has otherwise been very positive.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.920
So before we jump in all that and to give room for Ethan,

10:52.920 --> 10:56.600
I want to say thanks to Linode.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.560
Linode.com slash unplugged.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.840
Go there to get $100 in credit

11:00.840 --> 11:03.080
on a new account for 60 days, $100.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.400
And of course you're supporting the show.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.760
Linode is our hosting provider for everything we've built

11:07.760 --> 11:09.000
in the last couple of years.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.880
Their infrastructure is solid, it's fast, it's flexible.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.480
You can focus on your project

11:13.480 --> 11:15.920
and not on all the details of hosting a server,

11:15.920 --> 11:17.560
but you can get down as deep as you like.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.320
And they've got 11 data centers to choose from

11:19.320 --> 11:21.840
and every service level, every single box you get

11:21.840 --> 11:24.800
is backed by the best customer support in the business.

11:24.800 --> 11:28.400
And when that matters, it makes all the difference.

11:28.400 --> 11:32.000
And of course Linode is making our Jupiter Colony reunion

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
possible.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.040
They have been so supportive, not only financially,

11:35.040 --> 11:39.080
but by contributing the time of their designers,

11:39.080 --> 11:41.960
contributing the time of some of their web developers.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.280
And of course they're going to be making the meetups

11:44.280 --> 11:46.520
even more awesome with swag and giveaways.

11:46.520 --> 11:51.200
Like when I brought the idea up, it was like a co-idea.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.640
They were like, you know, we'd love to do something.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.640
And you know, we'd love the idea of a road trip.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.320
And I was like, well, we want to do a road trip

11:56.320 --> 11:57.760
and here's what we're talking about.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.440
And it was just, it clicked immediately.

11:59.440 --> 12:02.840
And they have been so supportive through all of this

12:02.840 --> 12:04.520
because they really care about this.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.720
Like what they have been focused on

12:06.720 --> 12:08.440
throughout the entire thing is like,

12:08.440 --> 12:09.760
when we get to that meetup, we just,

12:09.760 --> 12:10.840
we want to talk to people.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.720
We want to ask them what they think about Linode.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.640
We want everybody to have a great time.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.920
And it has been so easy to work with them

12:16.920 --> 12:18.880
because that is their end goal in this.

12:18.880 --> 12:22.200
And that has shined through when I've seen them support

12:22.200 --> 12:24.520
other projects in the communities, distributions,

12:24.520 --> 12:26.000
and of course events.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.480
And now to see them help us make this reunion possible,

12:28.480 --> 12:30.560
it's just been like, I don't know, man.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.600
It just took my appreciation up for Linode

12:32.600 --> 12:33.880
to a whole other level because of course

12:33.880 --> 12:36.160
I've appreciated them for an extremely good

12:36.160 --> 12:39.120
technical service that they've executed on extremely well

12:39.120 --> 12:42.600
since 2003 and like, okay, I recognize that indie game

12:42.600 --> 12:44.080
and I support that.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.200
But then to just kind of see them step up in this way,

12:46.200 --> 12:48.400
you know, the way they've contributed to the design team

12:48.400 --> 12:51.560
and the web team time and really been there to like check in

12:51.560 --> 12:52.800
and see what I think about what they're doing

12:52.800 --> 12:55.080
and all that stuff, like just way above and beyond.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.480
And it really shows the passion.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.080
And that's the thing, the passion for the Linux community

12:59.080 --> 13:00.880
and the passion for Linux itself.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.760
And I could tell you so much about the service

13:02.760 --> 13:03.800
and why we choose to use it,

13:03.800 --> 13:06.200
but I think that $100 will do the speaking for itself.

13:06.200 --> 13:09.080
So what I want you to do is go to linode.com slash unplugged,

13:09.080 --> 13:11.680
get that $100 for a new account, try this stuff out,

13:11.680 --> 13:13.960
build something, learn something.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.120
And of course you support the show.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.960
There's a lot of ways to host something.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.640
And there's a lot of different companies

13:18.640 --> 13:20.520
with weird, crazy funding schemes

13:20.520 --> 13:22.640
that are trying to dump on the market.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.080
There's only one that's like Linode,

13:24.080 --> 13:26.480
that checks all the boxes, remains independent

13:26.480 --> 13:27.560
and focuses on the things

13:27.560 --> 13:30.280
that make running services on Linux excellent.

13:30.280 --> 13:33.560
So go try it out at linode.com slash unplugged.

13:33.560 --> 13:38.560
So the Steam Deck has been announced

13:43.360 --> 13:45.000
and it's extremely impressive.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.200
From a hardware perspective,

13:46.200 --> 13:47.680
what they've managed to get in there

13:47.680 --> 13:51.040
with the AMD chip in there, the screen,

13:51.040 --> 13:53.080
the USB-C connectivity with an external dock,

13:53.080 --> 13:56.000
and then the storage expansion via SD,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.520
and then the form factor with the track pads,

13:58.520 --> 14:00.480
a lot of things are checking my boxes.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.320
Yeah, no kidding.

14:01.320 --> 14:04.080
I think it's checking a lot of boxes around the community.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.760
It seems like most of the people I know

14:05.760 --> 14:06.800
are thinking about buying one

14:06.800 --> 14:08.480
if they haven't already reserved one.

14:08.480 --> 14:09.920
I decided to reserve one.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.280
I decided to reserve the big boy

14:11.280 --> 14:13.880
because it's also got the anti-reflective screen.

14:13.880 --> 14:16.200
And I thought that just seemed like the way to go for me.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.680
Long-term, I'm probably going to use it.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.320
And I also, you know, I admittedly,

14:20.320 --> 14:21.800
there's a dad factor in here for me.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.720
This is sort of solving a problem.

14:23.720 --> 14:27.360
My kids are getting to an age where they want to game

14:27.360 --> 14:29.200
and they see their big brother doing it

14:29.200 --> 14:31.920
and now they want to do it, you know, the younger girls.

14:31.920 --> 14:35.200
But Dylan's got a pretty sweet gaming laptop, if I recall.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.040
Yeah, and I just can't afford

14:37.040 --> 14:38.760
to buy them all gaming laptops, right?

14:38.760 --> 14:39.600
That's crazy.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.360
Yeah, let alone laptops for yourself at some point.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.200
But as a dad, like the idea

14:43.200 --> 14:45.600
that we could all be multi-players, some gaming together,

14:45.600 --> 14:47.840
like that sounds like some like good memories right there.

14:47.840 --> 14:49.760
Yeah, that's the new dinner table.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.200
And then that they can dock this, right?

14:52.200 --> 14:54.600
That they can dock this and have a desktop PC.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.520
With Linux just right there, yeah.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.240
Yeah, big, that's a big deal for me at a price point

14:59.240 --> 15:01.000
that I can swallow because I was willing

15:01.000 --> 15:02.440
to get them switches, right, so.

15:02.440 --> 15:03.280
It's not too different, yeah.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.600
Yeah, this is, so from like the dad mode,

15:05.600 --> 15:08.360
this is such a big deal for me.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.600
And the reality is that Valve's clearly been working

15:11.600 --> 15:14.360
on this for a very, very long time.

15:14.360 --> 15:17.560
And they've also wrapped this up with a new pretty UI

15:17.560 --> 15:21.280
and they are promising 100% Windows game compatibility

15:21.280 --> 15:22.360
in the near future.

15:22.360 --> 15:25.640
We definitely have some thoughts on how that might work out

15:25.640 --> 15:28.400
as well as their new Arch base.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.320
Yeah, oh boy.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.680
Yeah, we'll do that in a little bit.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.960
But first, we wanted to shine a light

15:33.960 --> 15:38.280
on an area not getting very much coverage right now.

15:38.280 --> 15:41.040
Some potential fallout from Valve's new focus

15:41.040 --> 15:44.960
and that big drive for Proton compatibility.

15:44.960 --> 15:48.480
Prolific Linux game porter and developer Ethan Lee

15:48.480 --> 15:51.680
sounded the alarm bells about this on Twitter recently.

15:51.680 --> 15:55.280
And he's been involved with some of our favorite games.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.000
Late last night, we called him up

15:57.000 --> 15:58.640
to discuss how the launch of the deck

15:58.640 --> 16:02.040
might actually mean fewer native Linux games.

16:02.040 --> 16:03.280
Ethan, thank you for joining me,

16:03.280 --> 16:05.080
especially on the short notice.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.000
I know, and please fill in the gaps here,

16:07.000 --> 16:09.720
from my recollection, I know that you've been involved

16:09.720 --> 16:12.400
with some of my favorite Linux game ports,

16:12.400 --> 16:15.960
Streets of Rage 4, I believe there's a couple of others

16:15.960 --> 16:19.680
in there, including V that I never know how to pronounce,

16:19.680 --> 16:20.600
and more.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.680
It's funny, because I've worked on too much stuff.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.400
So I have to remember what I did recently.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.920
Streets of Rage 4 is probably the most recent one

16:27.920 --> 16:28.840
that people remember.

16:28.840 --> 16:35.000
But there's also Fez, Celeste, Dream Daddy, Rogue Legacy.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.960
And some libraries that Valve uses themselves as well.

16:37.960 --> 16:41.440
Yeah, so mostly what I do is I make an X&A re-implementation

16:41.440 --> 16:44.480
called FNA, and then alongside that, an XAudio 2

16:44.480 --> 16:46.960
implementation called F-Audio.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.920
And both of those, while they are actually

16:48.920 --> 16:52.160
designed for native games, they actually

16:52.160 --> 16:55.920
are now integrated into the official version of Wine

16:55.920 --> 16:59.000
as the X&A re-implementation and as the XAudio 2

16:59.000 --> 16:59.880
re-implementation.

16:59.880 --> 17:02.000
Because I designed them, in addition

17:02.000 --> 17:05.040
to making it easy to port stuff, to just be very accurate.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.360
And so they were able to integrate that

17:07.360 --> 17:09.400
into their software in a way that

17:09.400 --> 17:11.560
helps with preservation, which is the main goal of both

17:11.560 --> 17:12.520
of those libraries.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.400
Sure.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.840
And it sounds like, just from that overview,

17:15.840 --> 17:19.840
that Linux native games and porting games

17:19.840 --> 17:22.440
to be native on the Linux platform

17:22.440 --> 17:24.560
was a big part of what you've done

17:24.560 --> 17:25.840
and what your career has been.

17:25.840 --> 17:28.680
And that might be changing now with the announcement

17:28.680 --> 17:29.480
of the Steam Deck.

17:29.480 --> 17:32.400
Yeah, so basically since April 2012.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.680
So it's almost been 10 years.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.040
It's getting close.

17:35.040 --> 17:37.080
I've just been doing Linux game development

17:37.080 --> 17:38.560
as my full-time thing.

17:38.560 --> 17:41.000
It's always been my primary thing, first and foremost,

17:41.000 --> 17:42.840
to do Linux games.

17:42.840 --> 17:44.640
I did Mac versions alongside that

17:44.640 --> 17:48.440
because, just culturally, those two happen to be very similar

17:48.440 --> 17:50.640
and was an easy way to pitch a port.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.360
That actually stopped this year.

17:52.360 --> 17:55.960
So it was kind of strange to go from, in January, I said,

17:55.960 --> 17:58.240
OK, no more Mac versions.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.240
The ecosystem there is just too crazy.

18:00.240 --> 18:04.080
And I like working on platforms where

18:04.080 --> 18:05.840
I have a good relationship with the vendor,

18:05.840 --> 18:07.640
and they are not too invasive.

18:07.640 --> 18:11.880
Which, in hindsight, well, we'll get into that.

18:11.880 --> 18:15.120
Yeah, so it seems like you're looking at it

18:15.120 --> 18:17.440
even just a few months ago, and the situation's clear.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.760
Apple has an agenda.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.360
They have the M1 platform now.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.880
They're really not focused on wide game compatibility.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.080
It seemed like Linux would be the open platform.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.160
But I noticed a couple of red flags

18:29.160 --> 18:30.880
with the announcement of the Steam Deck,

18:30.880 --> 18:32.280
and then I saw your Twitter feed.

18:32.280 --> 18:35.120
But the first red flags I noticed,

18:35.120 --> 18:37.160
the developer documentation.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.520
So not just the promotional literature,

18:39.520 --> 18:44.120
but the developer documentation really only talks about Proton.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.800
There's a couple of slides that say native games are also

18:46.800 --> 18:51.600
compatible, but all of the docs just say focus on Proton.

18:51.600 --> 18:54.520
And then I saw your tweet that it

18:54.520 --> 18:56.920
seems that some people have maybe even been contacted

18:56.920 --> 18:58.360
suggesting that they should, instead

18:58.360 --> 19:01.040
of focusing on a native version, just go ahead and just focus

19:01.040 --> 19:02.800
on the Proton version.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.800
And I'm getting mixed signals on if that's something

19:05.800 --> 19:07.080
that Valve is pushing or not.

19:07.080 --> 19:11.120
And it seems like you've gotten wind of this same issue,

19:11.120 --> 19:12.600
and it seems alarming to you.

19:12.600 --> 19:15.480
The Deck is the thing that's, I mean, we'll get to that.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.480
But just for historical context, because I

19:17.480 --> 19:20.560
think the context particularly matters,

19:20.560 --> 19:23.000
both in the sense of where my role is in it

19:23.000 --> 19:26.560
and where Valve might have been coming from originally.

19:26.560 --> 19:30.600
So I think it was August 2018 that Proton ended up

19:30.600 --> 19:34.320
being announced as a part of the Linux client, which

19:34.320 --> 19:37.440
was exciting to me when I was always pitching

19:37.440 --> 19:39.200
the idea of Steam for Linux.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.720
It was always interesting to think about,

19:41.720 --> 19:44.920
even if you assume from 2012 on when they started doing Linux

19:44.920 --> 19:46.800
games for the Steam client natively,

19:46.800 --> 19:50.280
you still have a decade or even more longer,

19:50.280 --> 19:54.120
depending on what you consider older releases to be Windows

19:54.120 --> 19:58.200
only games that are this giant back catalog problem

19:58.200 --> 19:59.880
that they have to fight.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.880
And so for me, when I saw Proton the first time,

20:02.880 --> 20:04.480
it was like, oh, this is a great answer

20:04.480 --> 20:05.680
to the back catalog problem.

20:05.680 --> 20:08.320
And I think I ran a Mac fest panel about Proton

20:08.320 --> 20:12.440
specifically and how it did a really fantastic job of kind

20:12.440 --> 20:13.960
of filling in a gap.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.920
Right, games that were never going to get ported to Linux.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.760
The developers have long moved on.

20:18.760 --> 20:19.920
Or don't even exist.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.640
You couldn't even go back and say, hey,

20:21.640 --> 20:24.780
do you want to kind of do a remaster or something

20:24.780 --> 20:26.600
like that to make it.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.960
And it was to the point where I was

20:29.960 --> 20:31.600
kind of interested in working with it,

20:31.600 --> 20:33.720
because it was something that I had,

20:33.720 --> 20:35.280
even as a native developer, I was

20:35.280 --> 20:38.780
interested in as something of a preservation project,

20:38.780 --> 20:41.500
because FNA falls in that category, too,

20:41.500 --> 20:46.320
where it's like there are XNA games made by these one man

20:46.320 --> 20:49.600
development teams from like 10 years ago that kind of threw

20:49.600 --> 20:53.160
an XNA version out there, and nobody knows where they are.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.100
We have no idea what their identities are.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.880
We just have this binary blob, and we

20:56.880 --> 20:58.480
don't know what to do with it.

20:58.480 --> 21:03.920
So I actually, from I want to say like October 2018

21:03.920 --> 21:07.760
to like November 2019, I was technically on the Proton team.

21:07.760 --> 21:11.120
My job basically was to implement the new XAudio 2

21:11.120 --> 21:14.300
implementation that was causing a lot of problems for games,

21:14.300 --> 21:17.040
because XAudio 2 is very, very low level,

21:17.040 --> 21:19.680
and trying to do a high level emulation of it

21:19.680 --> 21:21.960
is basically impossible.

21:21.960 --> 21:24.000
And then kind of alongside that, we

21:24.000 --> 21:26.520
decided to do XNA integration as well,

21:26.520 --> 21:31.160
because it's not as big as the no AAA games made with XNA.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.920
So it's kind of one of those things

21:32.920 --> 21:35.120
that I don't know if they had to pitch it or anything.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.040
It was just something that we could at least

21:37.040 --> 21:42.200
justify as making 100% completion a viable thing.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.320
But after that, once the integration was done,

21:44.320 --> 21:46.600
it kind of became an interesting conversation of like,

21:46.600 --> 21:49.760
well, is there anything else you think you'd like to do with us?

21:49.760 --> 21:53.960
And I tried working on performance with them,

21:53.960 --> 21:57.760
because obviously, historically, Wine

21:57.760 --> 21:59.920
has kind of lagged in terms of performance,

21:59.920 --> 22:01.600
particularly compared to Windows, which

22:01.600 --> 22:03.100
is kind of a hard thing to compare.

22:03.100 --> 22:05.600
But the point is, there is this emphasis

22:05.600 --> 22:09.960
to make it more performant and as performant as Windows, which

22:09.960 --> 22:13.280
actually is surprisingly viable in some cases.

22:13.280 --> 22:14.200
So I tried doing that.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.840
And then once that kind of was explored,

22:16.840 --> 22:18.960
it was like, it started to lean like,

22:18.960 --> 22:20.760
do you want to be a Wine developer?

22:20.760 --> 22:23.040
And I said, no, because I mean, there's

22:23.040 --> 22:24.840
an obvious conflict of interest there.

22:24.840 --> 22:27.720
I would prefer that my time be spent making

22:27.720 --> 22:31.100
native games and the technology that makes native games work

22:31.100 --> 22:32.120
well.

22:32.120 --> 22:34.640
So after that, I kind of went back

22:34.640 --> 22:36.200
to native, where I made an emphasis

22:36.200 --> 22:38.000
on trying to focus on native.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
And it went OK at first.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.760
But within the last few years, it

22:41.760 --> 22:46.960
became very noticeable that the line between native and Proton

22:46.960 --> 22:51.200
was blurring, which, OK, sure, like Windows developers

22:51.200 --> 22:52.520
like to not do work.

22:52.520 --> 22:56.400
So being able to have that work done for them for free is fine.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.080
But within the last year in particular,

22:58.080 --> 23:01.440
I started noticing that developers

23:01.440 --> 23:04.040
weren't talking to me anymore.

23:04.040 --> 23:07.680
And if they were, they either were coming back to me

23:07.680 --> 23:09.400
from their old games saying, like,

23:09.400 --> 23:12.160
is this Proton something we need to worry about?

23:12.160 --> 23:15.240
Or in some cases, was just flat out, OK, we have Proton now.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.920
We don't need your services anymore.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.120
It's done.

23:19.120 --> 23:21.240
Some cases, I was able to kind of get against that.

23:21.240 --> 23:24.520
I know Streets of Rage 4 was kind of an awkward situation

23:24.520 --> 23:27.000
where it's one of those difficult parts where

23:27.000 --> 23:28.160
I don't know the full story.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.040
But you can tell it was definitely

23:30.040 --> 23:32.920
a case where Valve actively got involved with the Windows

23:32.920 --> 23:34.800
version and made it with Proton.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.760
And when it came time to actually start

23:36.760 --> 23:38.480
the work on the Linux version, there

23:38.480 --> 23:42.280
was this awkward conversation where it's like, well,

23:42.280 --> 23:43.200
do we need to?

23:43.200 --> 23:45.440
Or is this enough to make it work?

23:45.440 --> 23:48.520
And then luckily, they went through with it.

23:48.520 --> 23:51.120
It took a long time because the pandemic kind of made

23:51.120 --> 23:54.720
it difficult for QA to kind of check everything.

23:54.720 --> 23:58.240
But having that awkward conversation combined

23:58.240 --> 24:00.400
with the delays, it's a situation

24:00.400 --> 24:02.520
that that's like the best case scenario for what

24:02.520 --> 24:03.840
I've been experiencing.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.400
Most of the time, it's just developers

24:05.400 --> 24:08.560
just who I've previously worked with before just kind of shooing

24:08.560 --> 24:10.920
you away or just ghosting me.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.160
And you get the sense it's they've realized that we don't

24:13.160 --> 24:15.360
really need to bother with this native port.

24:15.360 --> 24:17.560
We can just make a few adjustments.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.120
Even Valve's engineers will give us

24:19.120 --> 24:21.120
the tips we need to make adjustments for Proton

24:21.120 --> 24:22.760
compatibility, and that's good enough.

24:22.760 --> 24:25.880
So that's sort of the thing is that there's this line that,

24:25.880 --> 24:28.320
and keep in mind, we haven't even gotten to the deck yet.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.160
This is like 2020.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.440
This is like a year before.

24:31.440 --> 24:34.360
And so there's this line that's not being drawn here

24:34.360 --> 24:38.280
where it's like, OK, the whole point of the back catalog

24:38.280 --> 24:43.320
problem was to kind of get a broad solution for a problem

24:43.320 --> 24:46.040
that is very, very large in scale.

24:46.040 --> 24:49.680
And while, of course, you're going to run into scenarios

24:49.680 --> 24:52.840
where you have a single game and you want to explore it,

24:52.840 --> 24:55.920
there is a very distinct line between trying

24:55.920 --> 24:58.320
to come up with a solution that works

24:58.320 --> 25:01.320
for a broad portion of the catalog

25:01.320 --> 25:05.200
and starting to act as a specialist, including

25:05.200 --> 25:09.240
developer outreach, where it's like, hey, that's

25:09.240 --> 25:11.840
what I'm supposed to be doing.

25:11.840 --> 25:15.520
It's my job to be the one who specializes the work

25:15.520 --> 25:19.200
and does the outreach and uses my expertise.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.680
And so there's this line that's blurred

25:20.680 --> 25:23.120
where it's like, well, the only real difference

25:23.120 --> 25:26.080
is that you and Valve, as far as we're concerned

25:26.080 --> 25:28.800
and as far as we're being told, are basically the same thing.

25:28.800 --> 25:29.880
But you cost money.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.040
Yeah, it's hard to compete with free.

25:32.040 --> 25:34.280
They're also promising less work, too,

25:34.280 --> 25:35.560
and less time investment.

25:35.560 --> 25:39.040
Yeah, and that's the thing that kind of becomes a struggle

25:39.040 --> 25:42.000
because I would have, if there was a distinction

25:42.000 --> 25:44.680
both in the internal process and in the way

25:44.680 --> 25:48.640
they present the product in a way that

25:48.640 --> 25:51.200
makes the distinction of what it takes

25:51.200 --> 25:53.160
to make a really good native game

25:53.160 --> 25:56.080
and what it takes to make it work in Proton,

25:56.080 --> 25:58.640
both on the back end and what developers have to do.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.960
And you really kind of make it clear

26:00.960 --> 26:04.640
that there's a one size fits all versus a specialized

26:04.640 --> 26:07.200
and who controls the product at its core.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.920
It's like, it feels like a loss leader product

26:09.920 --> 26:11.920
rather than a preservation product at this point.

26:11.920 --> 26:15.120
It feels like we have this giant thing that, obviously,

26:15.120 --> 26:17.280
I can't speak to how much it costs to develop Proton,

26:17.280 --> 26:19.040
but you can probably take a guess,

26:19.040 --> 26:22.200
given the gigantic size of the catalog combined

26:22.200 --> 26:24.200
with the expertise that it takes to actually get

26:24.200 --> 26:27.160
it to work with so many different things reliably.

26:27.160 --> 26:30.920
And so it just feels like it's become this thing where

26:30.920 --> 26:34.240
it's better for their image to not point any of that out.

26:34.240 --> 26:37.000
And unfortunately, as a result, it

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
puts us in the native world in an extremely uncomfortable

26:40.000 --> 26:44.480
position where we have to prove before we've even

26:44.480 --> 26:46.240
started the pitch that what we're doing

26:46.240 --> 26:48.800
makes sense, which is not uncommon.

26:48.800 --> 26:51.160
Like, hey, it's hard to justify a Linux version

26:51.160 --> 26:52.840
if you just go and say, let me do it.

26:52.840 --> 26:55.000
Obviously, you have to be able to say it's a small audience,

26:55.000 --> 26:56.040
but we can make it work.

26:56.040 --> 26:57.280
You'll make your money.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.040
It's not going to be a sunk cost.

26:59.040 --> 27:00.320
We can make it work.

27:00.320 --> 27:02.960
Versus, look, I know what Valve told you

27:02.960 --> 27:04.600
that everything I'm about to tell you

27:04.600 --> 27:06.560
is completely unnecessary.

27:06.560 --> 27:11.840
But trust me, it's hard to undo the words of a multi-billion

27:11.840 --> 27:13.040
dollar corporation.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.240
Especially when it's offering to save them money.

27:15.240 --> 27:16.720
That is very tricky.

27:16.720 --> 27:20.880
And it seems also it gives Valve this ability

27:20.880 --> 27:23.360
to ensure that there's going to be certain games

27:23.360 --> 27:25.200
on their platform if they go this route.

27:25.200 --> 27:28.640
I can see there's an incentive structure for Valve

27:28.640 --> 27:29.920
to pursue this avenue.

27:29.920 --> 27:30.640
Sure.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.480
It gives them a bit of a guarantee

27:32.480 --> 27:35.800
to be able to say that these games work

27:35.800 --> 27:38.600
without having to consult somebody else.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.280
Because I think for them, it's nice to be

27:40.280 --> 27:42.760
able to have confidence in their own stuff

27:42.760 --> 27:46.040
internally without having to depend on someone else.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.400
I mean, any company is like that.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.080
We like to have everything in-house.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.600
I can kind of see that making even more, or at least becoming

27:51.600 --> 27:53.520
even more of a priority when something like the deck

27:53.520 --> 27:54.240
is being worked on.

27:54.240 --> 27:55.960
Because that must have been in the works for a while.

27:55.960 --> 27:56.680
Yes.

27:56.680 --> 28:00.000
If you look at things like GameScope and other similar

28:00.000 --> 28:02.520
types of investments that Valve have made outside of the Steam

28:02.520 --> 28:04.000
client itself, you can see that this

28:04.000 --> 28:04.960
is something that they've been thinking

28:04.960 --> 28:06.240
about for a very long time.

28:06.240 --> 28:06.840
Yeah.

28:06.840 --> 28:10.000
And if they want others to sell hardware like this,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.840
they're going to need some sort of compatibility guarantee,

28:12.840 --> 28:15.800
some sort of middle layer that they control that

28:15.800 --> 28:18.120
makes sure that the games run on all the different,

28:18.120 --> 28:21.720
on the Dell version of the deck and the HP version of the deck.

28:21.720 --> 28:23.640
Me and some other people were talking about this

28:23.640 --> 28:25.280
earlier today.

28:25.280 --> 28:29.000
When we try to compare the Steam Deck to the Steam machines,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.700
we try to figure out what they wanted to correct

28:31.700 --> 28:35.080
and what they haven't corrected or how they're

28:35.080 --> 28:36.600
presenting the information.

28:36.600 --> 28:40.400
It does seem like we're not entirely sure

28:40.400 --> 28:43.180
what the difference is other than the catalog.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.560
Because if the idea is that you're going to have other

28:45.560 --> 28:48.800
vendors do this, what's different from this compared

28:48.800 --> 28:50.720
to Steam machines other than the form factor?

28:50.720 --> 28:53.800
Because I mean, I have a Steam machine here, actually.

28:53.800 --> 28:58.480
And it's basically just a Dell device they put Linux on.

28:58.480 --> 29:00.620
And that's kind of it.

29:00.620 --> 29:03.760
It's cool that we have other people making the hardware.

29:03.760 --> 29:08.520
But the hardware wasn't the problem.

29:08.520 --> 29:10.520
I know everybody talks about the fact

29:10.520 --> 29:12.640
that Linux would probably be more widely used

29:12.640 --> 29:14.600
if it was pre-installed.

29:14.600 --> 29:16.760
The Steam machines in particular made

29:16.760 --> 29:18.560
me reconsider that argument.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.720
Because the first thing that most people would do

29:20.720 --> 29:21.960
is they just put Windows on it.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.560
Because it turns out Steam OS versions just

29:23.560 --> 29:24.520
happen to be cheaper.

29:24.520 --> 29:27.080
And they can find Windows at a pretty steep discount

29:27.080 --> 29:28.720
where they can just reuse product keys.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.760
There's a million reasons that people would just

29:30.760 --> 29:32.960
buy a Steam machine and then throw Windows on it.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.640
So I think the software catalog for them

29:34.640 --> 29:37.080
was a bigger concern here, which is why I think they're

29:37.080 --> 29:41.160
being so aggressive about it and not really being

29:41.160 --> 29:44.040
all that concerned about the consequences of what happens

29:44.040 --> 29:45.800
to native developers at this point.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.580
And do you think that would motivate them

29:47.580 --> 29:51.240
to the point of discouraging native ports?

29:51.240 --> 29:52.600
It's up in the air.

29:52.600 --> 29:54.160
There are definitely some.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.960
When I was talking about Valve reaching out to developers

29:56.960 --> 30:00.720
about focusing on Proton despite having native versions,

30:00.720 --> 30:02.400
there was a bit of context lost in that,

30:02.400 --> 30:06.720
where it was a mixture of developers who historically

30:06.720 --> 30:09.480
have always released native and may have always

30:09.480 --> 30:10.600
been doing native anyway.

30:10.600 --> 30:16.000
And then getting this weird email about, by the way,

30:16.000 --> 30:17.600
you don't have to do this anymore.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.260
And then there was the other half, which

30:19.260 --> 30:20.800
is what I was talking about earlier,

30:20.800 --> 30:23.840
which is developers who have historically released native

30:23.840 --> 30:26.520
but may not have done it for their latest thing.

30:26.520 --> 30:29.800
And suddenly, there's this whole argument,

30:29.800 --> 30:32.280
like, oh, we don't need to worry about that anymore.

30:32.280 --> 30:34.160
And here's this thing that shows us that you don't

30:34.160 --> 30:35.600
have to worry about it anymore.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.800
Yeah, and look at all this buzz, look at all this press,

30:37.800 --> 30:39.560
and now look at these developer documents

30:39.560 --> 30:41.280
that just say target Proton.

30:41.280 --> 30:43.940
Right, and that was the thing that was really frustrating,

30:43.940 --> 30:45.960
is knowing that, because again, this

30:45.960 --> 30:47.120
is something that's been in development

30:47.120 --> 30:48.240
for a very long time.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.540
So it just is a little frustrating

30:50.540 --> 30:54.280
that there was all this time, and obviously there

30:54.280 --> 30:57.640
were lots of people working on this product from every angle.

30:57.640 --> 30:59.280
We had people who, including people

30:59.280 --> 31:02.080
who focus on Linux development, nobody looked at these docs

31:02.080 --> 31:05.320
and stopped to say, should we maybe

31:05.320 --> 31:09.720
have a line about it, like one?

31:09.720 --> 31:13.400
And the wording of it just seems so careless, just so

31:13.400 --> 31:15.640
unconcerned with the consequences of what

31:15.640 --> 31:19.080
it would mean for an entire industry of developers,

31:19.080 --> 31:24.720
for Valve of all people to say Linux native is unnecessary.

31:24.720 --> 31:29.040
You don't think that's going to have some consequences to that?

31:29.040 --> 31:32.480
And after that post came up, someone at Valve

31:32.480 --> 31:36.220
did reach out and were kind of surprised about it.

31:36.220 --> 31:37.720
Are you saying that someone at Valve

31:37.720 --> 31:41.240
that contacted you was surprised by your tweet?

31:41.240 --> 31:43.560
Yeah, I mean, hey, when something like that

31:43.560 --> 31:45.840
gets that much attention, particularly if you

31:45.840 --> 31:47.080
weren't expecting it, like it's.

31:47.080 --> 31:47.760
Sure.

31:47.760 --> 31:49.560
Yeah, I'll give them that.

31:49.560 --> 31:52.280
And the fact that they did reach out is great.

31:52.280 --> 31:55.080
But even after that conversation,

31:55.080 --> 31:58.920
it just seems like the risk of atrophy

31:58.920 --> 32:01.200
is not something they're thinking about.

32:01.200 --> 32:05.880
Because let's say hypothetically that, OK, sure, everybody

32:05.880 --> 32:06.920
gets on Proton.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.040
The product does well.

32:08.040 --> 32:09.500
And let's say hypothetically, there

32:09.500 --> 32:12.440
is that performance delta that developers care about.

32:12.440 --> 32:15.480
OK, but once you get to that point

32:15.480 --> 32:19.360
and then you start to talk about native after the fact,

32:19.360 --> 32:21.720
you have to consider what have native developers been

32:21.720 --> 32:23.040
doing in that time?

32:23.040 --> 32:24.840
Because I can tell you what I'm doing, which

32:24.840 --> 32:28.080
is nothing, because there's nothing I can do.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.640
I don't have clients anymore.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.880
So is the characterization of the response sort of, well,

32:31.880 --> 32:33.520
this is a stopgap measure.

32:33.520 --> 32:37.000
This is a temporary thing just to get games on the device.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.560
Was that the nature of the response?

32:38.560 --> 32:41.880
I think that might be the nature of the whole strategy.

32:41.880 --> 32:44.000
I mean, I don't think this is uniquely something

32:44.000 --> 32:47.080
they told me just uniquely in private.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.880
It seems to just be what they're thinking

32:49.880 --> 32:52.680
in general, which they talk about things like, oh, you

32:52.680 --> 32:53.640
can use Vulkan.

32:53.640 --> 32:57.280
You can use something that's not a patented codec,

32:57.280 --> 32:59.960
like use VP9 or whatever instead.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.000
But that's the expectation that this is going

33:02.000 --> 33:05.120
to take years to develop.

33:05.120 --> 33:08.040
And that's assuming it happens.

33:08.040 --> 33:10.640
So you're basically telling me that I,

33:10.640 --> 33:14.440
as a one-man development team who

33:14.440 --> 33:17.960
does Linux games, which already works on a very low budget,

33:17.960 --> 33:20.080
you're expecting me to just accept

33:20.080 --> 33:24.080
that I'm going to have this tank in revenue

33:24.080 --> 33:25.640
and just activity in general.

33:25.640 --> 33:28.040
And I'm just supposed to expect that

33:28.040 --> 33:30.360
at some indeterminate period of time in the future

33:30.360 --> 33:35.240
that suddenly it's going to turn back around based

33:35.240 --> 33:39.440
on just a hypothetical idea that it's going to come back.

33:39.440 --> 33:42.000
I have no material proof that's what's going to happen.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.560
People may just stick with Proton.

33:43.560 --> 33:44.560
They're happy with it.

33:44.560 --> 33:45.640
They're moving on to the next game.

33:45.640 --> 33:46.560
They don't even care.

33:46.560 --> 33:47.120
Right.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.840
Or it's just like, or maybe it won't happen.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.420
I'm just going to lose all my customers,

33:51.420 --> 33:53.560
and then the platform's going to fail.

33:53.560 --> 33:55.540
And then it's just going to be yet another thing that's like,

33:55.540 --> 33:56.960
well, it didn't even work this way,

33:56.960 --> 33:58.640
so why should we care, period?

33:58.640 --> 34:01.320
So there's all these risks that I'm just

34:01.320 --> 34:06.020
expected as some random jerk in Georgia supposed to just accept.

34:06.020 --> 34:08.560
And I'm just going to weather it out somehow.

34:08.560 --> 34:09.640
Well, Valve is doing the math.

34:09.640 --> 34:12.060
And you have to figure, they looked at the Steam machines

34:12.060 --> 34:13.960
and they went, all right, this didn't

34:13.960 --> 34:15.520
work for multiple reasons.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.520
And one of them was game compatibility.

34:17.520 --> 34:19.640
One of them might have been that they chose Debian

34:19.640 --> 34:20.560
as their base.

34:20.560 --> 34:24.360
The choice of Arch seems to be almost like a reactionary

34:24.360 --> 34:26.120
choice to their Debian choice.

34:26.120 --> 34:28.400
And now with Proton as this compatibility strategy,

34:28.400 --> 34:30.740
and they've been investing quite a bit in other aspects

34:30.740 --> 34:33.160
of the stack to improve performance.

34:33.160 --> 34:35.360
And you look at it and you go, they're really

34:35.360 --> 34:36.760
betting the farm on this.

34:36.760 --> 34:39.520
Because this is for a corporation,

34:39.520 --> 34:41.160
how many meetings must they have had?

34:41.160 --> 34:43.360
How many people, how many staffers

34:43.360 --> 34:44.920
must be working on this project for it

34:44.920 --> 34:48.360
to extend over five years or something like that now?

34:48.360 --> 34:49.760
I mean, it's remarkable.

34:49.760 --> 34:53.820
And so you have to figure they are on such a course

34:53.820 --> 34:56.320
with so much momentum that they're not really even giving

34:56.320 --> 34:59.120
how it impacts independent developers like yourself

34:59.120 --> 35:00.520
who are in that ecosystem.

35:00.520 --> 35:01.960
They're not even really thinking about it.

35:01.960 --> 35:04.520
Well, when you're that big, it's hard to measure.

35:04.520 --> 35:07.280
Even factoring out Linux, for example,

35:07.280 --> 35:09.960
Steam has kind of frustrated small developers

35:09.960 --> 35:12.080
for quite a long time.

35:12.080 --> 35:14.720
So this is just really my example of it,

35:14.720 --> 35:18.680
where when you have a billion dollars to spend,

35:18.680 --> 35:19.920
what's another million?

35:19.920 --> 35:24.760
But hey, I wish I had a million to look at.

35:24.760 --> 35:27.040
Yeah, yeah.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.040
Do you plan to go back into Windows gaming?

35:29.040 --> 35:30.160
What's your thoughts there?

35:30.160 --> 35:33.560
Is this sort of ending your Linux gaming career?

35:33.560 --> 35:36.520
It certainly is kind of putting a knife

35:36.520 --> 35:38.840
into my Linux development career.

35:38.840 --> 35:41.120
It would take a substantial turnaround.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.900
Because the thing is, even if they

35:42.900 --> 35:45.520
were to undo a ton of the stuff that they've done,

35:45.520 --> 35:46.680
it's out in the wild.

35:46.680 --> 35:48.800
And the impact on it, just as Proton has been,

35:48.800 --> 35:51.920
even buying closed doors, has been pretty tremendous.

35:51.920 --> 35:53.520
When I was having this conversation,

35:53.520 --> 35:57.560
I was like, I went and I looked at the numbers one more time.

35:57.560 --> 36:02.000
And you can see to the year, it just

36:02.000 --> 36:04.480
comes crumbling down real quick.

36:04.480 --> 36:07.000
So the fact that it's only getting worse

36:07.000 --> 36:10.720
is definitely kind of sticking a knife into it.

36:10.720 --> 36:13.480
But as a player, it's hard to say.

36:13.480 --> 36:15.580
I still technically made a lot of games.

36:15.580 --> 36:18.040
And it'd be fun to kind of be able to keep playing,

36:18.040 --> 36:19.760
or maybe even keep supporting them,

36:19.760 --> 36:22.040
depending on how aggressive the strategy is.

36:22.040 --> 36:23.840
Maybe they just decide, oh, we're

36:23.840 --> 36:26.120
just going to try and make all games Proton based.

36:26.120 --> 36:30.040
I don't know if that's kind of outlandish of a claim to make.

36:30.040 --> 36:32.440
But I don't know how desperate they're

36:32.440 --> 36:36.200
going to be to get to the end of this compatibility problem.

36:36.200 --> 36:39.360
And I've been using this stuff for over a decade.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.600
It'd be a shame to throw it all away.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.120
Indeed, indeed.

36:43.120 --> 36:45.180
It kind of seems like the best hope

36:45.180 --> 36:48.320
would be if game shops appreciated

36:48.320 --> 36:50.580
the value of a native port, and they wanted that.

36:50.580 --> 36:53.280
And I suppose the only way we're going to get that is if the customers

36:53.280 --> 36:54.160
are asking for it.

36:54.160 --> 36:56.620
Yeah, and that's the thing that's been really discouraging,

36:56.620 --> 36:59.880
is kind of seeing the response to just the idea

36:59.880 --> 37:01.920
that that might be what they're doing.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.320
I mean, obviously, a couple of comments on the internet

37:04.320 --> 37:06.520
doesn't represent a whole community.

37:06.520 --> 37:08.400
But it really was just kind of seeing

37:08.400 --> 37:11.440
that even after 10 years of making games,

37:11.440 --> 37:13.740
like the attitude, even with my name on it,

37:13.740 --> 37:15.240
was still basically good riddance,

37:15.240 --> 37:17.240
was a little disheartening.

37:17.240 --> 37:21.800
And it's difficult being as negative as this.

37:21.800 --> 37:24.680
But being told that the last 10 years of your life

37:24.680 --> 37:26.560
were unnecessary is a, I don't know

37:26.560 --> 37:28.880
how I'm supposed to spin that in a positive way

37:28.880 --> 37:32.120
without putting in a lot of mental gymnastics into it.

37:32.120 --> 37:32.800
I understand.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.720
I enjoy the games that you have been involved in.

37:35.720 --> 37:37.800
And of course, I know a lot of our audience

37:37.800 --> 37:40.960
very much does appreciate a native port of the game.

37:40.960 --> 37:43.560
So you have supporters in our audience.

37:43.560 --> 37:44.920
Well, keep in touch.

37:44.920 --> 37:49.000
Just kind of let me know if any way which direction it does go, I suppose.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.880
It's such a game changer now, to kind of use a horrible pun.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.320
And we just don't really know.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.680
But I do appreciate you informing us and enlightening us

37:57.680 --> 38:00.840
of this side of it, because I think this is an aspect that just hasn't gotten

38:00.840 --> 38:04.360
a lot of coverage in what has otherwise been a lot of excitement

38:04.360 --> 38:05.280
around the deck.

38:05.280 --> 38:07.480
Yeah, and it sucks to be the bad guy for something

38:07.480 --> 38:09.780
that is actually kind of cool in terms of the hardware.

38:09.780 --> 38:14.960
But I kind of have bills and stuff.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.480
Developers got to eat.

38:18.480 --> 38:20.560
Linux.entropy.works.

38:20.560 --> 38:23.800
Use promo code love13 and save 15%.

38:23.800 --> 38:26.800
Entropy is an industry-leading mobile and web development studio

38:26.800 --> 38:28.120
based in the UK.

38:28.120 --> 38:31.040
They have global clients, including Mars Wrigley, Walmart, MediaCom,

38:31.040 --> 38:32.300
the Financial Times.

38:32.300 --> 38:34.600
I mean, they're trusted by some of the biggest names in media content.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.840
But Entropy isn't necessarily all about those big global corporations.

38:37.840 --> 38:40.480
They love working with smaller businesses and startups.

38:40.480 --> 38:43.000
They just love to realize really outstanding apps.

38:43.000 --> 38:43.800
That's it.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.720
And web applications, too.

38:45.720 --> 38:47.320
I'm talking mobile, desktop, the web.

38:47.320 --> 38:50.560
Entropy runs on Linux, and they're a bunch of Linux nerds.

38:50.560 --> 38:52.880
They have distro hoppers in their office.

38:52.880 --> 38:55.060
They love to geek out on Linux hardware.

38:55.060 --> 38:57.040
It's why they reached out to me, because they're listeners of the show.

38:57.040 --> 38:59.080
They're part of our community.

38:59.080 --> 39:00.040
And they use Ruby.

39:00.040 --> 39:02.240
And they use Ruby on Rails for web applications.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.200
And more and more, Flutter.

39:04.200 --> 39:06.400
Flutter for mobile, desktop, and for web apps.

39:06.400 --> 39:11.320
And that also, by the way, includes the Linux desktop.

39:11.320 --> 39:14.000
They have pioneered some of the most complex Flutter apps out there.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.360
The new Flutter reality is here.

39:16.360 --> 39:19.080
They've baked in image recognition and machine learning into some apps

39:19.080 --> 39:21.400
they're launching globally for Mars.

39:21.400 --> 39:26.400
With Flutter, Entropy can just rapidly build an iOS app, an Android app,

39:26.400 --> 39:32.080
and a Windows app, a Mac OS app, and yes, of course, a Linux app.

39:32.080 --> 39:35.000
And they can really do it in no time.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.640
They're already really one of the global leaders in Flutter development.

39:37.640 --> 39:40.240
They have dozens of deployments in the last year alone.

39:40.240 --> 39:43.320
So if you're thinking about taking the plunge into Flutter for a Linux desktop

39:43.320 --> 39:47.160
app, and you want to hit other platforms as well, maybe you're a small business,

39:47.160 --> 39:49.880
a large business, a startup, just kind of getting going.

39:49.880 --> 39:53.520
But you just want to get an outstanding app on a number of platforms,

39:53.520 --> 39:55.400
Entropy is ready to chat.

39:55.400 --> 39:59.600
They love to discuss ideas, and of course, love to share their opinions.

39:59.600 --> 40:03.320
And regardless if you want to move forward with a project, or maybe you just

40:03.320 --> 40:05.160
kind of want to get your head wrapped around some of this stuff,

40:05.160 --> 40:06.960
get an idea of what this looks like.

40:06.960 --> 40:09.840
Maybe you just want to discuss your favorite distro.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.840
Entropy would love to chat.

40:11.840 --> 40:16.880
So to get started, they're offering listeners of Linux Unplugged 15% off their

40:16.880 --> 40:18.360
first project.

40:18.360 --> 40:20.280
This is a great way to take the plunge.

40:20.280 --> 40:21.640
What an opportunity.

40:21.640 --> 40:24.040
And you're supporting a member of our community.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.360
You're shopping locally within the Linux community.

40:26.360 --> 40:30.280
So just head to linux.entropy.works and fill out one of their contact forms.

40:30.280 --> 40:33.640
But cite the promo code LUP13, and then they'll get in touch,

40:33.640 --> 40:35.160
and they'll get started.

40:35.160 --> 40:36.920
And there's never any pressure.

40:36.920 --> 40:40.280
They're always just happy to discuss your project and help in any way they can.

40:40.280 --> 40:44.840
That's linux.entropy.works, promo code LUP13.

40:44.840 --> 40:52.280
Since our chat with Ethan, we've thought a lot about some of the points he brought

40:52.280 --> 40:54.760
up, and we're very glad he raised them.

40:54.760 --> 40:58.360
I think this is a discussion that it's good for the community to have.

40:58.360 --> 41:01.080
We're in a sort of weird point in Linux gaming.

41:01.080 --> 41:03.640
And frankly, it's pretty tough to hear the troubles he's facing.

41:03.640 --> 41:05.040
I mean, he's made a lot of great games.

41:05.040 --> 41:08.600
He's doing really good and important and just neat work.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.640
It does kind of make sense.

41:10.640 --> 41:14.600
I can understand how Proton getting as good as it is has eaten up a lot of the

41:14.600 --> 41:17.560
air that used to exist here.

41:17.560 --> 41:20.760
Ethan mentioned not wanting to become a wine developer.

41:20.760 --> 41:21.640
And I get that, right?

41:21.640 --> 41:23.160
That's not why he got into this space.

41:23.160 --> 41:24.280
It's not what is exciting.

41:24.280 --> 41:24.760
Right.

41:24.760 --> 41:29.000
But at the same time, I don't know, it sort of seems, and I don't like saying it,

41:29.000 --> 41:32.920
but it sort of seems that if you want to be involved in the future of Linux gaming,

41:32.920 --> 41:37.880
at least as it stands right now, maybe you have to embrace Pivot to Proton.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.120
Okay, I think we could talk more about that, but I see where you're going.

41:42.120 --> 41:46.360
In some ways, it's sort of like Electron or Flutter at the high level where we're

41:46.360 --> 41:49.800
getting what we want, whether that's the app you need for work on the desktop or

41:49.800 --> 41:52.360
it's the game you wanted to play without having to install Windows.

41:52.360 --> 41:57.880
We're getting all that on Linux, but we're not getting it with our tools and

41:57.880 --> 41:59.240
our philosophy baked in.

41:59.240 --> 42:02.360
And I think that's a little bit of a tough pill to swallow sometimes.

42:02.360 --> 42:02.600
Yeah.

42:02.600 --> 42:06.120
And the Proton games don't necessarily have all of the functionality you want.

42:06.120 --> 42:08.280
Sometimes they're lacking in multiplayer functionality or

42:08.280 --> 42:09.880
currently anti-cheat functionality.

42:09.880 --> 42:16.520
But after talking with Ethan, I kind of thought I could see Valve looked at that

42:16.520 --> 42:20.680
first attempt with Steam Machines and they said, okay, what went wrong?

42:20.680 --> 42:24.200
And they went down a list and they said, well, it was pretty hard actually basing

42:24.200 --> 42:27.240
on Debian because we're doing all this work upstream, but then it takes forever

42:27.240 --> 42:28.520
to get to Debian.

42:28.520 --> 42:29.320
Well, you know what?

42:30.360 --> 42:33.960
It was pretty rough getting the games to run because we didn't have Proton at that

42:33.960 --> 42:34.280
time.

42:34.280 --> 42:34.760
Right.

42:34.760 --> 42:39.000
So compatibility was a joke and people weren't really that keen to port their games.

42:39.000 --> 42:44.680
And of course, there was a weird third party ecosystem in there and I could see

42:44.680 --> 42:46.920
them looking at this going, that was a failure.

42:47.800 --> 42:52.120
And what I could see them doing now when they take more of a console look at it,

42:52.120 --> 42:56.200
a handheld console look, is I could see the focus on Proton being a way to

42:56.200 --> 42:58.680
prevent failure.

42:58.680 --> 43:02.920
Like it's this insurance layer, it's this middle layer that they can guarantee

43:02.920 --> 43:07.080
that's going to work and that it'll work across any third party maker of a deck

43:07.080 --> 43:11.640
as well. And they could just say, you know, we looked at going native, but guys

43:11.640 --> 43:13.560
like Ethan, they only scale so far.

43:13.560 --> 43:17.320
There's only so many developers in the world and we want all game compatibility.

43:17.320 --> 43:19.000
We don't want just the native games.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.880
And you can see how from a business case, too, that this sort of keeps it under

43:21.880 --> 43:23.800
their own control where it's like, well, this is our layer.

43:23.800 --> 43:27.880
We can guarantee that you'll have these API endpoints and not, yeah, you know,

43:27.880 --> 43:29.640
we'd really like you to target native Linux.

43:29.640 --> 43:32.680
Here's a list of some people you could try and work with to get there.

43:32.680 --> 43:35.800
I mean, that would be great to see and I think that could still be a part of the

43:35.800 --> 43:39.320
option, but you can see how that wouldn't maybe be enough for that big push here.

43:39.320 --> 43:42.200
And I think the other thing, too, since they launched the steam machines is

43:42.200 --> 43:46.680
Vulcan didn't become like this universal across all platforms standard that we

43:46.680 --> 43:48.520
hoped it definitely is great.

43:48.520 --> 43:53.480
But DirectX has really continued to thrive in the Microsoft ecosystem, and

43:53.480 --> 43:56.280
that is a massive reality of the marketplace.

43:56.280 --> 43:59.480
And I think this isn't this isn't the same thing as steam machines.

43:59.480 --> 44:01.400
These are not steam machines 2.0.

44:01.400 --> 44:04.360
And I think there's probably a few key reasons for that.

44:04.360 --> 44:08.040
Number one, steam machines were really just entirely a third party hardware

44:08.040 --> 44:11.480
thing that the makers really just didn't make much money.

44:11.480 --> 44:13.640
There was like a bad incentive structure there.

44:14.200 --> 44:18.120
Additionally, steam input, it was a baby compared to where it's at now.

44:18.680 --> 44:21.160
Third party controllers were nowhere where they're at now.

44:21.960 --> 44:27.160
And it didn't really kind of work for the demo because just about everybody who

44:27.160 --> 44:32.120
had a big steam library that would find value in a steam machine already had a

44:32.120 --> 44:36.040
gaming PC and then Val very quickly cut their legs out underneath the steam

44:36.040 --> 44:39.400
machine by coming up with the steam link, which just took your already existing

44:39.400 --> 44:41.640
expensive PC and made it work on your TV.

44:42.360 --> 44:44.360
And gamers already had Xboxes.

44:44.920 --> 44:45.960
Proton wasn't a thing.

44:45.960 --> 44:48.440
So there wasn't really this Linux compatibility story.

44:49.080 --> 44:51.880
And they just failed.

44:51.880 --> 44:53.560
It just was it was a flop.

44:53.560 --> 44:57.400
And I think that flop was a harder pill to swallow.

44:57.400 --> 45:00.920
And now they look at the market in a probably a much more practical.

45:00.920 --> 45:03.080
We're just going to fix base OS problems.

45:03.080 --> 45:05.960
And you can hear this in their interviews, like with IGN.

45:05.960 --> 45:09.160
The way they talk about it is, well, we solve some core OS problems.

45:09.160 --> 45:11.560
And then we built up this proton layer as a middle layer.

45:11.560 --> 45:13.160
And now we're shipping the deck.

45:13.160 --> 45:17.400
And they don't they don't think about it in terms of native games.

45:17.400 --> 45:22.200
They just think about it as a game runtime environment that includes all of

45:22.200 --> 45:25.640
the steam bits, including their their super old Ubuntu base.

45:25.640 --> 45:25.880
Right.

45:25.880 --> 45:31.080
Yeah, really, it's a hodgepodge of magic stuff to make games play at the end of the day.

45:31.640 --> 45:31.880
All right.

45:31.880 --> 45:34.040
So let's get into our first email of the day.

45:34.760 --> 45:36.040
Gabe writes in.

45:36.040 --> 45:40.840
Hey, Chris and Wes, if Valve called you up and asked you for some top tips on how to

45:40.840 --> 45:46.200
successfully ship Arch on the new Steam Deck, what might you advise them to do?

45:46.200 --> 45:49.480
Ah, based on all of our pro experience, of course, with our server, I assume.

45:49.480 --> 45:50.520
That uptime, baby.

45:50.520 --> 45:50.680
Yeah.

45:50.680 --> 45:55.080
Well, number one, Gabe, is don't don't wait about six months between updates.

45:55.080 --> 45:56.120
Don't don't do that.

45:56.680 --> 46:00.760
But in all seriousness, how would you ship Arch on a mass consumer device?

46:00.760 --> 46:05.080
Yeah, I mean, you're going to need to introduce some kind of control, whether that's image

46:05.080 --> 46:08.760
base or something more like Manjaro, where, you know, you have your own repos that you're

46:08.760 --> 46:11.880
maintaining and you can sort of keep packages at a stable place.

46:11.880 --> 46:12.520
That's my bet.

46:12.520 --> 46:14.920
That's what I don't think that's the solution I'd prefer.

46:14.920 --> 46:17.240
But I think that's the solution they're going to go with.

46:17.240 --> 46:21.960
Well, because you need some level of curation rate just just for QA purposes, at least.

46:21.960 --> 46:26.600
Yeah, and you don't want like weird like libraries coming down, breaking things and whatnot.

46:26.600 --> 46:28.440
So I think that would be one of them.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.520
I think you got to also do a minimum viable Linux install.

46:32.520 --> 46:34.200
That's one of the things we did on our server.

46:34.200 --> 46:35.880
Minimum viable Linux install.

46:35.880 --> 46:36.680
And I'm going to say it.

46:37.240 --> 46:39.880
I think they should use ButterFS on the root file system.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.880
Oh, going bold with this one.

46:41.880 --> 46:44.840
You need something that has low resource impact.

46:44.840 --> 46:47.640
You need something that works well on a single SSD.

46:47.640 --> 46:50.200
And it'd be great to have something that supports snapshots.

46:50.200 --> 46:54.200
Right, so that even if you might have some sort of arch breakage, you can be somewhat

46:54.200 --> 46:57.160
guaranteed you can just reboot back into a snapshot.

46:57.160 --> 46:58.520
What about the kernel?

46:58.520 --> 47:02.280
Because if you go LTS kernel, you're not necessarily going to have all the hardware

47:02.280 --> 47:03.640
support you need, possibly.

47:03.640 --> 47:06.920
You know, that might be one spot where they're just going to compile it themselves.

47:06.920 --> 47:10.600
I wonder, you know, maybe maybe trying to tweak things for performance or otherwise,

47:10.600 --> 47:12.360
or they just want the latest and greatest.

47:12.360 --> 47:16.200
Does anyone in the Mumble Room have a have a hot tip for Valve on how to ship this thing

47:16.200 --> 47:18.760
in a way that's usable by consumers?

47:18.760 --> 47:20.120
I guess I'll have the hot tip.

47:20.760 --> 47:26.280
And I'm going to I'm going to say the most probably traumatic slash controversial statement.

47:27.320 --> 47:32.520
Fork the entire package set, because when you're working with delivering a product,

47:32.520 --> 47:36.040
you need to be able to have testable checkpoints.

47:36.040 --> 47:41.560
And the easiest way to do that when you're building a full scale product, soup to nuts,

47:41.560 --> 47:46.120
where you have both you're controlling the kernel as well as going all the way up to

47:46.120 --> 47:52.600
things like the user space, the desktop and and fiddly bits here and there is branch the

47:52.600 --> 47:58.520
entire distribution, filter out what you don't need, build it, integrate it and release it

47:58.520 --> 48:04.200
on your own schedule, because that way you can ensure consistent quality and you can

48:04.200 --> 48:09.960
work around the the underlying faults in the software management stack to make sure that

48:09.960 --> 48:11.960
upgrades are not going to be painful.

48:11.960 --> 48:17.000
Because in a traditional arch setup, it is fairly common for people to have to manually

48:17.000 --> 48:22.360
work through upgrades, especially with more invasive things or stuff where like library

48:22.360 --> 48:24.840
switching happens and things like that.

48:24.840 --> 48:28.840
So those are things that are not acceptable for a product.

48:28.840 --> 48:34.360
And in order to mitigate that, you need to take the whole thing into your hands and deal

48:34.360 --> 48:35.080
with it.

48:35.080 --> 48:38.920
Dan, you have a lot of experience about shipping arch on mobile devices from Angera.

48:38.920 --> 48:40.040
Do you have any thoughts?

48:40.040 --> 48:43.800
Not other than it's hard to get a kernel just right.

48:43.800 --> 48:49.320
So you need to compile that yourself if you want to actually get it working for the device

48:49.320 --> 48:50.280
you're shipping it on.

48:50.280 --> 48:50.520
Sure.

48:50.520 --> 48:51.400
So you agree with Wes.

48:51.400 --> 48:53.560
We're probably going to see a custom kernel on this thing.

48:53.560 --> 48:54.520
Yeah, yeah, I do.

48:54.520 --> 48:56.120
Yeah, that wouldn't be too surprising.

48:56.120 --> 48:59.080
They were already doing that for the Debian steam OS, for what it's worth.

48:59.080 --> 48:59.800
Ah, fair point.

48:59.800 --> 49:00.200
Sure.

49:00.200 --> 49:01.240
Yeah, fair point.

49:01.240 --> 49:06.520
Additionally, they already have a an arch repo with their own custom kernel, a patch

49:06.520 --> 49:09.960
kernel with the Linux fsync, I think.

49:09.960 --> 49:10.520
Right.

49:10.520 --> 49:15.880
They originally created it for shipping the Mesa ACO stuff that they were working on.

49:15.880 --> 49:19.560
I think it was, what, a year ago, two years ago, three years ago.

49:19.560 --> 49:25.240
I forget exactly when, but when they were first working with Red Hat on the ACO Vulkan

49:25.240 --> 49:31.720
stuff for AMD on Mesa, they created this AUR repository to ship it.

49:32.600 --> 49:34.200
I shouldn't call it an AUR repository.

49:34.200 --> 49:35.240
That's not what it is.

49:35.240 --> 49:40.840
It's an arch Pac-Man repository, and they created it so that they could ship it to people

49:40.840 --> 49:41.960
to test it and use it.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.760
It's being reused for everything else.

49:44.760 --> 49:47.160
But hey, that's that's where it started from.

49:47.160 --> 49:47.480
Right.

49:47.480 --> 49:52.920
OK, you know, and as far as the reliance on Proton, it definitely seems like a concern,

49:52.920 --> 49:57.880
especially if if game shops see it, it's just like a super easy, like easy button to get

49:59.000 --> 50:02.280
stack support or if that's all they're willing to do as well.

50:02.280 --> 50:05.320
You know, like if that's like, oh, well, that's all we care about.

50:05.320 --> 50:08.040
It doesn't matter that it doesn't run on your other Linux over here.

50:08.040 --> 50:09.240
We weren't going for Linux support.

50:09.240 --> 50:11.240
We were going to click the box to go on the deck.

50:11.240 --> 50:15.960
But doesn't that long term undermine Valve because they essentially become reliant on

50:15.960 --> 50:20.040
DirectX and Microsoft's gaming platform, which is in direct competition with them.

50:20.680 --> 50:25.720
So doesn't long term Proton kind of undermine Valve's position because they could become

50:25.720 --> 50:27.640
wholly reliant on their competitor?

50:27.640 --> 50:32.840
Yet they develop, you know, push their own sort of alternatives or does do Proton evolve

50:32.840 --> 50:36.680
as it needs to and at some point maybe split off from some of the space?

50:36.680 --> 50:41.480
It seemed like the way Ethan characterized some of the responses from Valve that potentially

50:41.480 --> 50:44.600
Valve is just pitching this as a transition technology.

50:45.240 --> 50:48.440
But I think Ethan's response to that was, yeah, but it'll become permanent.

50:48.440 --> 50:51.960
Like it's that temporary solution will become the permanent solution.

50:51.960 --> 50:53.320
It just works, you know.

50:53.320 --> 50:54.200
Good enough.

50:54.200 --> 50:59.080
Yeah, but Valve could be creating themselves a new cage by becoming so dependent on DirectX.

50:59.080 --> 50:59.720
I'll leave it.

50:59.720 --> 51:01.560
You know, I want to say a note about this.

51:01.560 --> 51:07.320
Like when we're talking about Proton versus native Linux, I want to just say something,

51:07.320 --> 51:12.200
a particular quote, a better Windows than Windows and a better DOS than DOS.

51:12.200 --> 51:18.600
The operating system that used that slogan is no longer with us because emphasizing that

51:18.600 --> 51:25.320
point made it so difficult to convince people to build for that platform that it couldn't

51:25.320 --> 51:30.440
survive when more investment was required to make it successful.

51:30.440 --> 51:35.400
And that platform was IBM's Operating System 2 or OS2.

51:35.400 --> 51:35.960
Yep.

51:35.960 --> 51:36.440
Yep.

51:36.440 --> 51:37.240
Good point.

51:37.240 --> 51:37.480
All right.

51:37.480 --> 51:39.480
Well, we've got some more feedback.

51:39.480 --> 51:45.240
Mark has a distro that Chris and young Wesley might like to kick the tires of.

51:46.200 --> 51:48.440
That one made me chuckle young Wesley.

51:48.440 --> 51:48.920
Love it.

51:48.920 --> 51:49.480
And thank you.

51:50.360 --> 51:50.760
Yes.

51:50.760 --> 51:57.320
So this is Mofo Linux, Linux designed to defeat state censorship and surveillance.

51:57.320 --> 51:59.320
Yeah, I meant to give this a go this morning.

51:59.320 --> 52:03.320
But then I got distracted with all of the tech stuff.

52:03.320 --> 52:07.480
But Mofo Linux is like fight the man with Linux.

52:07.480 --> 52:09.320
And it's at mofolinux.com.

52:09.960 --> 52:12.440
And it is, well, it's a unique website.

52:12.440 --> 52:13.240
I'll give it that.

52:13.240 --> 52:17.880
It pitches itself as having a few things out of the box that make it more secure, like encrypted

52:17.880 --> 52:23.880
DNS over TLS that has open VPN and Tor set up ready to go and a bunch of software tools that

52:23.880 --> 52:26.440
are meant to anonymize your use of the internet.

52:26.440 --> 52:27.880
They want to be pretty clear about this.

52:27.880 --> 52:32.920
This is not simply an Ubuntu ISO with crypto and VPN applications added.

52:32.920 --> 52:36.840
The system has been stripped, de-bloated and optimized to help you break out

52:36.840 --> 52:38.360
and access the global internet.

52:38.360 --> 52:44.040
I love it when somebody uses a base distro and then craps on it by saying like we've

52:44.040 --> 52:44.840
de-bloated it.

52:44.840 --> 52:47.480
Well, why'd you pick a bloated distro to begin with there, hotshot?

52:47.480 --> 52:51.160
And like, why you got to crap on the people that made your distro possible as you're

52:51.160 --> 52:52.040
building your distro?

52:52.040 --> 52:55.560
But either way, it definitely is a distribution with attitude.

52:55.560 --> 52:59.000
And so I wanted to kick the tires before the show.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.040
But then that chance to chat with Ethan came up.

53:02.760 --> 53:05.880
But they pitch it as something you could boot on a live environment.

53:05.880 --> 53:07.320
So it'd be pretty easy to try it out.

53:07.320 --> 53:08.360
So I might give it a go after.

53:08.360 --> 53:10.360
Yeah, something to throw for a future episode.

53:10.360 --> 53:12.120
And I love the name, right?

53:12.120 --> 53:13.720
I mean, Mofo Linux.

53:13.720 --> 53:14.680
That's pretty great.

53:14.680 --> 53:20.360
Matt writes in, I was wondering if you all could recommend a VPN device that had a Linux

53:20.360 --> 53:21.720
client or service.

53:21.720 --> 53:25.160
We use checkpoint firewalls and it doesn't have a Linux client.

53:25.160 --> 53:26.200
We have to use Windows.

53:26.200 --> 53:28.200
So any recommendations would be great.

53:28.200 --> 53:31.080
I've recently just started listening to the podcast and enjoy learning about Linux and

53:31.080 --> 53:32.280
various distros.

53:32.280 --> 53:33.400
Thanks, Matt.

53:34.280 --> 53:39.720
West, I know we both are in a long term committed relationship to WireGuard.

53:39.720 --> 53:40.440
Yeah, true.

53:40.440 --> 53:43.320
And we shall never stray.

53:43.320 --> 53:45.560
But do you have any VPNs on the side?

53:45.560 --> 53:51.480
Well, I have some VPNs I use just for connecting out when I want to not be geo blocked by things

53:51.480 --> 53:55.320
or if I'm traveling and the hotel has sort of sketchy Wi-Fi, things like that.

53:55.320 --> 53:59.560
So yeah, I do rely on some third party VPN services from time to time, some of which

53:59.560 --> 54:02.120
now have WireGuard, which is very nice to see.

54:02.120 --> 54:05.000
But of course, they all have open VPN, too.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.280
Do you have one you recommend?

54:06.280 --> 54:10.440
I've been using TorGuard, but really, that's just because I paid for some discounted multi

54:10.440 --> 54:11.800
year account ages ago.

54:11.800 --> 54:17.480
And I know some folks are really picky and rightfully so about how good is their policy

54:17.480 --> 54:21.720
around their logging and is there evidence around has that come up in court before?

54:21.720 --> 54:22.680
And those are all good things.

54:23.560 --> 54:25.000
I don't use it for that kind of stuff.

54:25.000 --> 54:30.360
It's casual security layer that I just layer on top to get around whatever local network

54:30.360 --> 54:31.000
I'm on.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.680
But they have a Linux client.

54:32.680 --> 54:35.320
They publish just open VPN config files.

54:35.320 --> 54:37.560
They've added WireGuard support to just about all their servers.

54:37.560 --> 54:39.320
So I've had no reason to switch.

54:39.320 --> 54:40.040
That's the two things.

54:40.040 --> 54:41.640
If they have WireGuard support, great.

54:41.640 --> 54:45.800
If they don't, if they have open VPN, if they can just provide you a config file, you can

54:45.800 --> 54:48.360
just use Network Manager, Provado VPN.

54:48.360 --> 54:51.800
They've been a sponsor on SSH before on Self-hosted, so disclaimer.

54:51.800 --> 54:55.240
But I really like Provado because they have a free tier that pretty much lets you do everything

54:55.240 --> 54:55.720
you want.

54:55.720 --> 54:59.080
And then if you want to get into like peer to peer software and that kind of stuff, they

54:59.080 --> 55:00.360
have a paid tier that works for that.

55:00.360 --> 55:01.960
So that's Provado VPN.

55:01.960 --> 55:07.640
And then I also have a NordVPN account that I use for content bypassing because they have

55:07.640 --> 55:09.080
an Android TV app.

55:09.080 --> 55:14.680
But I was just on this week's Destination Linux podcast, episode 235.

55:14.680 --> 55:20.280
And VPNs that work with Linux was one of the topics we kicked around, as well as we all

55:20.280 --> 55:22.280
chimed in on the Steam Deck, of course.

55:22.840 --> 55:24.680
So I got a chance to hang out with my buddies.

55:24.680 --> 55:25.320
It's been a while.

55:25.320 --> 55:31.160
And that's episode 235, which we will have linked in the show notes for that.

55:31.160 --> 55:31.480
All right.

55:31.480 --> 55:35.320
So we just have a couple of emails about Rocky Linux, and then we're going to wrap up the

55:35.320 --> 55:36.440
feedback.

55:36.440 --> 55:38.840
Wes, do you want to take the first one?

55:38.840 --> 55:39.080
Yeah.

55:39.080 --> 55:39.960
Morgan writes in.

55:40.760 --> 55:41.240
Hey, all.

55:41.880 --> 55:44.200
Linux HPC sysadmin here.

55:44.200 --> 55:47.000
That's high performance computing, if you're not familiar.

55:47.000 --> 55:51.480
Just wanted to tip you off as to where I see academic HPC systems going.

55:52.200 --> 55:57.720
I know of two Ivy League schools that have effectively decided on Rocky Linux as their

55:57.720 --> 56:03.800
centos replacement for some or maybe all of their research computing clusters.

56:03.800 --> 56:05.080
These can be some pretty big clusters.

56:05.080 --> 56:10.280
I can't share details, but we, the academic HPC industry, have kind of all been waiting

56:10.280 --> 56:14.280
to see where CERN went after the centos announcement.

56:14.280 --> 56:18.680
They've been very slow, likely waiting on the Rocky release before deciding between

56:18.680 --> 56:19.880
Alma and Rocky.

56:20.680 --> 56:25.640
Unfortunately, for the discussions I've been in, Rocky always has a leg up.

56:26.120 --> 56:32.280
Though I think this might just have been some name recognition, think centos co-founder.

56:32.840 --> 56:33.720
I don't make the rules.

56:33.720 --> 56:36.040
I simply live comfortably beneath them.

56:36.040 --> 56:38.600
It's amazing the mileage that story gets, isn't it?

56:38.600 --> 56:39.800
It really is.

56:39.800 --> 56:44.120
Anyway, I just figured it was worth mentioning that thousands of our servers will most likely

56:44.120 --> 56:47.240
move to whatever CERN ends up switching to.

56:47.240 --> 56:48.280
Something to watch.

56:48.280 --> 56:53.640
Yeah, so this is a really fascinating moment we are in because we have a clock.

56:54.360 --> 56:59.320
There's a countdown we have until the end of December for the people that are just die

56:59.320 --> 57:04.040
hard, traditional centos release model, they have to make a choice.

57:04.040 --> 57:04.680
And that's hard, right?

57:04.680 --> 57:08.600
Where we've talked so much that really what's going to help you make a choice is going to

57:08.600 --> 57:10.040
be way down the road at this point.

57:10.040 --> 57:10.280
Right.

57:10.280 --> 57:14.600
It's like these distributions, this enterprise thing, it's a long term thing.

57:14.600 --> 57:17.960
We won't know for a few years which was really the best contender.

57:18.840 --> 57:21.320
And right now they're technically very similar.

57:21.320 --> 57:26.200
So what you end up having to kind of go by is all of the stuff that surrounds the distribution,

57:26.200 --> 57:30.760
like the engineers or the or the or the foundation behind it or the structure of the company

57:30.760 --> 57:31.240
or whatever.

57:31.240 --> 57:35.640
And that is sort of all we have right now.

57:35.640 --> 57:37.000
Crystal writes in.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.880
She says, I was struck by the chat with Jack from Alma Linux.

57:39.880 --> 57:43.480
It seemed like a lot was covered that Rocky Linux would want to respond to.

57:43.480 --> 57:46.360
I know you mentioned you invited them on the show, but what happened with that?

57:46.360 --> 57:50.200
Keep up the great work and thanks for helping those of us trying to choose between Rocky

57:50.200 --> 57:51.240
and Alma Linux.

57:51.240 --> 57:59.400
So we did we did invite Greg and the community manager from Rocky Linux on the show via email.

57:59.400 --> 58:04.200
In fact, we even held our chat with Jack for a week so that way we had we gave them a week

58:04.200 --> 58:08.920
to answer the email instead of answering the email, though they did show up in the IRC

58:08.920 --> 58:11.880
chat during the live show a couple of weeks ago.

58:11.880 --> 58:13.000
It started pretty good.

58:13.480 --> 58:18.520
We linked the log in the last week's episode, if you're interested, and then it kind of

58:18.520 --> 58:19.720
slid downhill.

58:19.720 --> 58:22.120
It kind of got a little rough.

58:22.920 --> 58:26.120
I think it's a real shame that Rocky Linux chose not to come on the show.

58:26.920 --> 58:28.600
I'll read you the email they sent me.

58:29.400 --> 58:32.600
I think it's a little disingenuous and I'll link the full email in the show notes.

58:33.320 --> 58:36.360
But in here, Stack writes, the Rocky team talked afterwards.

58:36.360 --> 58:40.200
This is after the little IRC incident that happened during our live show.

58:40.920 --> 58:43.160
He says, the Rocky team talked afterwards.

58:43.160 --> 58:48.440
We're going to attempt to further disassociate comparisons between Rocky and others.

58:48.440 --> 58:53.080
And others, like all the Linux, which right there, that's such crap.

58:53.080 --> 58:57.160
I mean, I hate to say this, but that's what everybody's doing right now.

58:57.160 --> 58:58.600
People want to know which one to go with.

58:59.880 --> 59:02.040
That's the very focus right now is comparing the two.

59:02.600 --> 59:06.680
Stack goes on to say, because Greg couldn't be bothered to write the email himself, but

59:06.680 --> 59:11.000
Stack goes on to say, we just don't feel like it's helpful to contrast and compare when

59:11.000 --> 59:15.080
the goal for most of these projects is to be one to one with Upstream and provide awesome

59:15.080 --> 59:16.120
community support.

59:16.120 --> 59:22.680
We would rather be in a position to lift Rocky and the community and others, like Alma, lift

59:22.680 --> 59:26.760
them up and then try to make ourselves out to be something better than we are.

59:27.320 --> 59:33.160
And so because that is their goal, they just couldn't make it to come on the show and respond

59:33.160 --> 59:33.560
to us.

59:34.280 --> 59:39.160
And unfortunately, all I really have is my personal experience and interactions with

59:39.160 --> 59:44.360
Greg and the team, which is I went out of my way to contact them and try to get them

59:44.360 --> 59:44.920
involved.

59:44.920 --> 59:49.000
It felt like for a brief moment, we had an opportunity for an impartial body to be a

59:49.000 --> 59:51.160
bridge that creates a community of enterprise distros.

59:51.160 --> 59:55.160
And that seemed like something new and special.

59:55.160 --> 59:57.000
I was really excited about that.

59:57.800 --> 01:00:04.040
But the conversations that we had and the way that things went down in the IRC, it made

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.240
it clear that wasn't going to happen.

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:11.320
And instead of extending that bridge, in my opinion, Greg proactively went to the register

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:16.440
and got a softball interview where he claims to have seen the light and seen the way on

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.320
how all of this works.

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:20.920
Now he now understands the genius behind sent off stream.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:26.040
And the last bit to help connect all the dots was Neil.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.040
It was Neil in our chat room.

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:31.640
He shook sense into Greg and now he's seen the light.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.360
Of course, it wasn't the entire conversation that we had with Jack because you'd never

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:35.960
want to give all money credit.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.960
It wasn't the points brought up in the chat room.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.400
I mean, Neil deserves all the credit in the world.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.200
He works his ass off.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.560
But let's be frank, these are all things that Greg already knew.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:48.520
And then instead of coming on the show, he went and got a softball interview at the register

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.360
a few days before our episode came out.

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.800
And he knew it was coming out because I had the courtesy of giving him a heads up over

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.300
email.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.400
And that's just my personal experience with the guy.

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:03.880
And what I saw was a lot of show and not an actual lot of delivery there.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:09.320
And what I see and just in my in my personal experience, what I see is I see Jack from

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.320
Alma Linux in our Mumble Room right now.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.840
You know, he doesn't have access to our show notes.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.200
He doesn't know what we're talking about.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.320
But I see somebody from Alma Linux showing up to be part of the conversation.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:23.880
And I can tell you this, having been creating Linux content for 13 years now, I can tell

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:28.360
you that the projects that show up and participate at this level that have this kind of passion

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:34.760
always sort of have the morality and the compass that agrees with my personal tastes and my

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.720
moralities.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.320
They tend to be people that are truly in it for the greater good.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:43.080
They want to be communicative with the community so that way they can convey their ideas and

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:47.240
try to get acceptance at every level and try to reach at the grassroots level of the community,

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.640
which is how you have to get a conversation like this started.

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.840
The people that get that, they get the way free software works.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:57.640
They get the way that working within the free software, the dynamics of that.

01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:02.120
And those are the projects that tend to be in it for the right reasons for the long term.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:07.400
And in my estimation right now, without much more to go on, I've had a pretty gross interaction

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.000
with the Rocky Linux folks.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:13.000
And then the actions I saw them take afterwards and the words that they use to try to convince

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.520
me why they're not coming on the show felt very manipulative, all in my opinion, of course.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.640
And what I've seen from Alma Linux is a track record that already exists for 10 years.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:25.880
Engineers on staff that seem like they could very likely actually contribute upstream to

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:30.760
CentOS stream, which means they could actually make an impact on RHEL, which is an opportunity

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:35.880
we have never seen before, and they've already delivered on their promises so far.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.320
And we have their community manager in our room right now here to interact with the community,

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:46.200
which, in my opinion, is just crushing it because it's an open room.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.640
Anybody can say anything and he's right there, right?

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.480
There's no buffer and that takes guts and that takes commitment.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:58.520
And I was willing to roll out the red carpet for Greg and have a nice civil chat.

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:02.760
You guys know me, you know how my interview style is, you know how I roll, but that's

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:03.960
not where it ended up.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.480
So you make your own decisions out there.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.440
You all have to do that.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:09.720
But I don't think we'll be deploying any Rocky Linux servers.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:10.920
I find it very disappointing.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.080
Coming on the show would have just been a great opportunity.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:17.080
You know, it could have been a great opportunity to say, yeah, some heads were butting early

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.240
on, but, you know, we're moving on now.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.640
But it didn't happen.

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:22.920
It is what it is.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.080
I agree with Johnny Hughes.

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:27.320
He's a CentOS project developer and a board member.

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.000
He says, go with all the Linux.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.600
I agree with Johnny.

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.720
Well, with that out of the way, we better clean up in here.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:40.120
So I heard there was quite the virtual lug this Sunday.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.000
Yeah, of course, there's always a great virtual lug on Sunday.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.600
It's just that we don't always make it.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.400
But you did.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.520
Of course I did.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.760
Well, we we got land done early.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.240
So I had a little spot of free time on Sunday after working out some issues.

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:57.960
You know, I was using a different system where I'd compiled pipe wire from source.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:03.640
And I also had mumble installed from a flat pack and took a little bit to get going.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.040
That doesn't have to be your experience, though.

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:09.960
You just get mumble set up and don't mess around with your own custom audio setup.

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.440
You'll be fine.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:10.920
It's easy.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:15.800
And there's a lot of folks there, like like Minimac, who are ready to help you out, which

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.440
is amazing.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.240
That's true.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.280
And then your mumble is all good to go in case you can make it on a Tuesday.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:20.760
Right.

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:24.120
You know, playing hooky, you want to come hang out with your Linux buddies on a Tuesday.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:27.240
We do this show every Tuesday that we can until we're on the road.

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.280
And then maybe it gets weird.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.000
I don't know.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.280
But we'd love to get your feedback.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:32.920
We're going to try to integrate that more while we're on the road and just get some

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.120
conversations going.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.280
So Linux unplugged dot com slash contact.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.440
It's open feedback season for the rest of the summer.

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:40.680
Go fill our inbox.

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:45.000
Also, our telegram group has had some really great conversations going recently.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.040
Like I've been popping in there and having some great chats.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.000
So check that out.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.160
The conversation is going all the time at Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash telegram.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:56.920
And then last but not least, got to plug that meetup page because those meetups are getting

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:57.420
close.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:58.840
And I want you to remember it.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:00.280
So I say it multiple times now.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.840
Meetup dot com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:05.640
All right.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.880
We have a pick that's kind of special.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.280
It's it's like Wireshark, but not.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:15.000
Yeah, it's called hot wire and it's a GTK application.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:15.640
Yeah, that's right.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.160
No electron here.

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:21.880
Now, it does leverage a lot of the Wireshark and T-Shark infrastructure to capture traffic

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.720
and explore the contents.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:27.880
But it's really aimed at displaying a subset of that data and a subset of all the crazy

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:31.400
protocols that Wireshark supports in a focused way.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.160
It looks really, really good.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.240
But there's one thing missing, Wes.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.560
Can you can you spice it up a little bit for me?

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:47.160
It's written in rest.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.560
And there's one aspect of this that is super cool.

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:54.680
Hot wire can open TCP dump files and record traffic through a FIFO file, which basically

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:58.920
means you don't need escalated or special root privileges to monitor traffic.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:02.760
It's just smart to think about this because the way I got it installed was the flat pack

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.880
and, you know, in modern sort of more secure Linux apps, you might not want to give some

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:09.560
random app pseudo access to capture from your wireless card or something.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:13.240
And so this is sort of set up in a way where you can go run that dump on your own and pipe

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:13.800
it in.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.920
Wow, a network capture tool via flat pack.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.160
That is that is the new era right there.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:23.880
It's early days, currently only supports the Postgres, HTTP, and HTTP2.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.200
But if you're working with one of those, it could be pretty handy.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.160
Well, I'm out.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:27.640
I'm out.

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:32.600
Instead, I'm going to recommend RustScan.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:36.280
Yes, another RustScan.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:36.920
It's too much.

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:39.960
The whole world is getting rusty.

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:41.960
And it's this one.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.320
This one is modern.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:43.880
It's fast.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:49.080
And this one has the exciting tagline that it can scan all 65,000 ports in three seconds,

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.920
which is really what got my attention.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:53.000
I was all in when I saw that.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.800
And of course, it's in the AUR.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.960
It's also in homebrew.

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:01.640
And as Wes will tell you, it's also available via Docker.

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:02.760
That's right.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.280
A little secret tip here.

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:07.800
If you try it out, you'll see it throws a little shade at nmap too once it runs.

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:08.440
So that's fun.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:09.640
Oh, man.

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:15.240
Well, I mean, 65,000 ports in three seconds is actually legitimately impressive.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.720
I can't even really conceive how it's technically possible.

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:19.240
All the CPU cores, I suppose.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:21.800
It's the power of Rust.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:22.440
Yeah, I guess.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.640
The Rust can do anything.

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.600
If you're into the Twitter thing, you can follow this here show.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.960
We are at Linux Unplugged.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.880
The network is at Jupyter Syctl.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.920
It's a great way to get show announcements or news or send us some feedback.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:34.040
You can do it that way.

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.480
Of course, we have that contact page.

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.520
That's the canonical way.

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:39.080
No, not that canonical, but like the official way.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.960
linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:45.880
Now, there's only two more episodes left in studio.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.160
So do try to join us live.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.840
Make it a Linux Tuesday.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:49.560
See you next week.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.440
Same bat time, same bat station.

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:52.920
That's right.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:57.320
That's noon Pacific, 3pm Eastern over at jblive.tv.

01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.680
jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for your local time.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:04.440
If you want a full breakdown of the Steam Deck announcement and our analysis,

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.200
check out Linux Action News.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:10.040
There's a lot packed in there, including some very interesting news that

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.520
we just don't have time in the Unplugged program.

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:14.520
But I wish we did.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.160
I wish we did.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.040
Maybe one day.

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.120
Maybe we'll do three unplugs a week one day.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.200
Only you can make it possible by becoming a member.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.480
unpluggedcore.com, three episodes a week.

01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:26.760
Trust me, you don't want that.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.280
No, I don't want that.

01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.400
No, thanks for joining us.

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:56.120
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:09.000
You know, I think something that doesn't get talked about with the whole

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:15.000
AMA Linux and Rocky Linux and CentOS Stream is this market that these distributions serve

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.760
is fundamental to how Linux makes money.

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:22.600
Like the desktop isn't what gets a lot of contributions to Linux.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:23.320
I mean, absolutely does.

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:26.760
But when you look at like big money contributions and percentages,

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:31.080
it's companies contributing to Linux to get their hardware enablement support

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:34.840
or to get something working for their device stack that's in the enterprise.

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.320
It's so server focused.

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:39.640
It's like the desktop market doesn't even exist, right?

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.640
When you look at how Linux makes money.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:45.640
And so when you take these distributions like Rocky and Alma,

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:50.040
they are serving a market that screws with how Linux can survive.

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:53.960
And so if one of them goes sideways, and I just think, you know,

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.880
I look at cloud Linux was around for 10 years, right?

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:59.640
But if one of these go sideways, the damage to Linux is reputation.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:04.120
These free distros, these quote unquote free distros, you just can't trust them.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.480
You could see how a narrative like that could take off like wildfire.

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:12.200
So the actual like what's at stake here is fairly significant when you consider

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:15.880
this is what makes Linux relevant in the marketplace is this category

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.800
that these distributions are serving.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:22.600
And people have just a few months left to start making their decisions, right?

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:25.400
So that's why when you say, oh, we don't want to make a comparison.

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:27.160
It's just ludicrous.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:30.840
People are making the, yeah, you may not want to, but people are and sort of have to.

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:32.120
It's vital right now.

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.040
And the stakes couldn't be higher.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:37.080
So like, we really got to figure this out because

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.680
we could tank Linux's reputation in this category.

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:43.640
I wonder how many folks are testing out multiple, you know, sort of.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.480
I'd hope that at least at first, especially that the delta would be not too large.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.280
So even if you did sort of go with one, try it all out, you know,

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:53.480
if you needed to, if there was some strange bug or something you could pivot.

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:55.160
But what are the differences going to be?

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:58.040
Yeah, hopefully it's hard to screw up in a meaningful way.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:01.720
You spin them up and you can hardly even tell really once you pass the login screen.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:03.880
I mean, you can hardly even tell.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:07.560
And I think that's a burden load that a lot of people are going to look at and go,

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:09.400
well, let's just go a stream.

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:11.720
I mean, I think a lot of people are going to consider that.

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:12.600
I would.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.440
That's what I would want.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.520
Yeah, I mean, it's coming, you know.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.920
Before we get out of here, I didn't want to talk about it in the main show,

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:21.080
but I do want to bring awareness to this problem.

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:25.640
The head of strategy for the Muse group seems to be threatening a developer

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:30.040
of one of the Audacity forks with thinly veiled threats about contacting

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.000
the government and getting his citizenship revoked and things like that.

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:37.880
Not Audacity, the fork of what's the other program?

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:41.160
Oh, MuseScore, MuseScore, thank you, thank you, right.

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.600
It's a fork of MuseScore, thank you.

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:45.400
Yeah, so that was LibraScore, I think is what it's called.

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:50.680
I forget what it's, I forget the name of it, but yeah, I was horrified.

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.960
When I saw that, when I saw that, it's like he tried to cover it up

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:57.720
by editing the message, but he clearly forgot that GitHub actually

01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:01.240
archives all versions of comments in in threads.

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:06.760
So the original one was still there and it was absolutely horrific because

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:13.480
he's basically blackmailing the dude, like without actually going out right

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:16.360
and saying it, it basically was it was bad.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:22.040
That was some serious mafia shit, man, to go after someone like that

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:28.520
and basically threaten him with like deportation back to China, that was not nice.

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:29.800
A public forum, no less.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.720
Yeah, on GitHub, on GitHub.

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:34.680
One thing is a threatening email or something, but like, geez.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:39.480
But also like implied that, you know, we know that if this happens,

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.160
you won't be long for this world.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:47.880
It's like, what kind of crap is going on here?
