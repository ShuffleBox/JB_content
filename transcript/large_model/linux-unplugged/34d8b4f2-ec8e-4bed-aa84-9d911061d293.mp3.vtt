00:00.000 --> 00:08.920
As we record, 10 years ago, Steam's beta went public on Linux.

00:08.920 --> 00:10.240
It's been 10 years, boys.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.560
Congratulations, everyone.

00:13.120 --> 00:18.280
November 6, 2012, the initial beta was limited to just select participants.

00:18.480 --> 00:22.280
They wanted to work out early bugs and then they announced they'd be

00:22.280 --> 00:25.800
releasing it to the wider public later as more Source Engine games became

00:25.800 --> 00:32.080
available and they based the original Steam stuff on Ubuntu 12.04.12.10.

00:32.120 --> 00:33.240
That's what I'm still running around.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
And now, you know, with the Steam Deck out there, things are looking pretty good.

00:38.760 --> 00:46.640
Steam on Linux was at a pretty healthy 1.28%, which is, I mean, 1% sounds small,

00:46.640 --> 00:49.640
but when you consider the massive base of Steam and how it's always growing,

00:50.480 --> 00:52.680
that's almost, you know, 1.3%.

00:52.680 --> 00:53.360
That's pretty decent.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.080
Mac's only at 2.23%.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.200
So we're sniffing at the bottom of the Mac heel right now.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.720
And as the Deck sells, there'll be more and more soon.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.640
That's pretty nice to see.

01:02.840 --> 01:07.840
You know, you look at where Valve's at now with Linux, it seems like we're in a

01:07.840 --> 01:10.360
pretty good position for that market share number just to get bigger and bigger.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.040
Yeah, right.

01:11.560 --> 01:12.800
It's getting great.

01:12.800 --> 01:25.360
I think it's only getting better.

01:25.360 --> 01:29.360
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:29.640 --> 01:30.320
My name is Chris.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.240
My name is Wes.

01:31.280 --> 01:32.200
And my name is Brent.

01:32.680 --> 01:33.480
You're back.

01:34.000 --> 01:34.680
Welcome.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.440
Thank you for having us again.

01:36.480 --> 01:40.720
The boys are back in town this week and we're surprising each other with three

01:40.720 --> 01:44.520
unknown topics, so I can't tell you what we're going to talk about because I don't

01:44.520 --> 01:45.040
know.

01:45.200 --> 01:49.960
What I do know is that I've got a big update on my Odroid H3 Plus.

01:49.960 --> 01:52.800
Finally, really looking forward to telling you about that.

01:53.120 --> 01:56.520
And I know we'll round out the show with some great boosts and picks and a lot

01:56.520 --> 01:56.960
more.

01:57.440 --> 02:01.520
So before we go any further, let's give a shout out to that virtual lug.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.400
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:03.640 --> 02:04.640
Hello, guys.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.080
Hey, Wes, and hello, Brent.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.320
Hello.

02:07.320 --> 02:08.000
Hello.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.320
Hello, and hello, everybody up there in quiet listening.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.600
We got a big crowd up there.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.040
They're being very quiet today.

02:14.880 --> 02:15.680
That's the nature of it.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.640
But are they listening?

02:17.920 --> 02:20.640
I hope so, because I'd like them to go over and say good morning to Tailscale.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.160
Head over to tailscale.com.

02:22.520 --> 02:25.320
It's a mesh VPN powered by WireGuard.

02:25.680 --> 02:26.200
We love it.

02:26.240 --> 02:29.720
I used the heck out of it recently.

02:30.480 --> 02:33.240
I just got to go into my most recent Home Assistant installation as well.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.560
It's a powerful mesh VPN product.

02:35.560 --> 02:39.800
Go say good morning to our friends over at Tailscale and use it for free up to 20

02:39.800 --> 02:41.560
devices at tailscale.com.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.360
Tell them I'm plugged a program, sent you.

02:45.200 --> 02:48.080
All right. So before we get into the show today, we got to sort this out.

02:49.280 --> 02:53.560
We got some geocache drama, and I don't know if Brent just has selective memory

02:53.560 --> 02:59.160
holing or if I'm confusing locations and names again, but one of us is right and

02:59.160 --> 03:02.840
one of us is wrong, and we've got to settle it now before we go any further.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.480
So you put it in the doc, so I'll let you start, Brent.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.560
Sure thing.

03:06.880 --> 03:11.840
Jared wrote in with a little note that made me wonder if our geocache at Folsom

03:11.840 --> 03:12.680
might be a flop.

03:13.640 --> 03:18.520
Jared writes, I stopped by the Folsom geocache with my kids and spent over an

03:18.520 --> 03:20.960
hour looking and digging around without success.

03:21.800 --> 03:22.280
Just a note.

03:22.280 --> 03:23.480
We didn't bury any of them.

03:23.680 --> 03:26.320
Apparently that's a faux pas in the geocache world.

03:27.320 --> 03:30.840
Jared continues, I met another fellow listener who happened to be looking for

03:30.840 --> 03:33.720
it too, which was about, okay, that's amazing.

03:33.720 --> 03:34.320
Isn't that great?

03:34.440 --> 03:38.040
So that got me thinking, how many people are looking for this stuff?

03:38.040 --> 03:38.960
I really want to know.

03:39.000 --> 03:39.840
We love hearing that.

03:39.840 --> 03:42.960
So please, if you went looking and didn't find, don't be disappointed.

03:43.160 --> 03:43.720
Leave us a note.

03:43.720 --> 03:46.120
We'd love to hear it or stash another one.

03:46.120 --> 03:47.360
If it's missing, hide one.

03:47.920 --> 03:48.360
I don't know.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.640
That's actually a great idea.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.760
I don't know how you'd market like a JB community one.

03:51.760 --> 03:55.840
Maybe you put a note in there or something or a thumb drive with some JB shows.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.400
Maybe we could send them some stickers.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.720
We put in a t-shirt that we were hoping that was going to work.

03:59.720 --> 04:04.600
Jared continued at this point, I think it's either one found by someone else

04:04.640 --> 04:08.480
as the area doesn't, does get frequent traffic or two.

04:08.560 --> 04:13.280
It's so well-hidden that we need another clue besides Chris's burnt trees.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.040
Listen now, come on, why are you coming at me?

04:17.680 --> 04:18.640
Why are you coming to me with that?

04:19.680 --> 04:20.800
Oh, you hit the cache.

04:21.280 --> 04:23.720
I was there in person, but I had no idea where you hit it.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.960
You had to tell me and, uh, I looked for a little bit and had a hard time.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.960
So I think that's, I mean, that's part of the balance, isn't it?

04:29.960 --> 04:34.120
It's it's balancing, not having just random people find it because

04:34.120 --> 04:36.800
we want our JB fans to find it.

04:36.880 --> 04:41.480
But also, so it needs to be hidden well enough that not just a random person

04:41.480 --> 04:44.240
finds it and the excuses come out.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.200
You see how he's attacking my hiding styles here.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.080
He's attacking me.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.440
I had this exact same challenge on the other geocaches.

04:50.480 --> 04:51.800
Oh no, I know what's going on here.

04:51.800 --> 04:55.840
You see, here's what happened is I got a personally good, reasonable spot

04:55.840 --> 04:58.840
to hide it, and then Brent couldn't find it.

04:59.640 --> 05:02.480
So he's got it all in his head that I made it super hard.

05:02.800 --> 05:03.640
And you know why?

05:03.760 --> 05:05.240
Here's why he can't find it.

05:05.280 --> 05:06.520
Here's why Jared couldn't find it.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.360
I believe this was found almost immediately.

05:08.400 --> 05:08.880
Oh, really?

05:08.880 --> 05:12.240
I have a clear recollection on one of our shows, and I think it was the

05:12.240 --> 05:14.200
peak of our travel, so we don't remember it.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.040
But I remember in one of our shows, this was the first one that

05:17.040 --> 05:18.240
got found was the Folsom one.

05:18.560 --> 05:19.480
No, I disagree.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.360
I think it's the one that Wes planted in that tree that got found first.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.080
Mine was definitely found.

05:24.240 --> 05:24.760
Okay.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.720
All right, that might be true, but I swear, I remember talking about

05:27.720 --> 05:32.560
the Folsom one being found, so we need someone else to go on location.

05:32.960 --> 05:33.240
Okay.

05:33.360 --> 05:34.960
Did we even ever hide one there?

05:34.960 --> 05:36.560
At this point, I'm beginning to question it.

05:37.560 --> 05:41.880
I've heard a lot of stories, but I think we need either trackers in these

05:41.880 --> 05:44.200
things or something so that we could tell if they've been moved.

05:44.560 --> 05:49.160
But actually, I think one thing that might help is maybe we need a central

05:49.160 --> 05:52.840
place to collect all the geocaches and the status of them, whether they've

05:52.840 --> 05:55.520
been found, not found, et cetera.

05:55.520 --> 06:01.600
So, uh, actually take off seven, five, one on our GitHub suggested

06:01.640 --> 06:03.680
that we implement such a system.

06:03.680 --> 06:06.080
So I am going to put out a pledge.

06:06.120 --> 06:06.600
Here you go.

06:06.640 --> 06:07.320
You ready for this?

06:07.320 --> 06:13.560
Oh, so by next Linux unplugged, that's in seven days, we will have a

06:13.560 --> 06:15.320
geocaching tracking system in place.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.000
Now it might not be fancy.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.080
We've talked about in that issue, some really fancy ways of doing it, but we'll

06:21.080 --> 06:25.680
at least have something and I will go back and try to figure out which ones

06:25.680 --> 06:27.360
have been found, which ones haven't.

06:27.360 --> 06:30.080
And I'll collect all of the, you know, coordinates and everything

06:30.080 --> 06:32.080
in a nice, easy to find place.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.000
There you go.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.120
I believe the Folsom one has been found.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.800
I will give a little bit more context because I'm looking at the

06:37.800 --> 06:39.800
video I took of it right now.

06:39.840 --> 06:46.080
And what I would say is you go down the trail to the shore where there's, um, a

06:46.080 --> 06:49.800
river, no, it's a lake or whatever, and there is some burnt logs, pretty much

06:49.800 --> 06:52.800
right off to the right-hand side when you're walking down there and those

06:52.800 --> 06:56.680
burnt logs under one of them here, here, I'll show it to you too, Wes.

06:56.680 --> 07:00.960
Maybe you can think of a way to describe this, but so here to grab the phone, you

07:00.960 --> 07:03.040
can see the, that's the video right there.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.920
How would you describe that spot?

07:05.960 --> 07:10.000
It's just kind of down on the shore under some burnt logs.

07:10.320 --> 07:14.440
I mean, it's not, there's nothing, not especially burnt from this picture,

07:14.440 --> 07:16.160
just kind of some, some regular logs.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.040
There's, I mean, at the time there was a bunch of leaves.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.760
That's the one clue I give is burnt logs and youth.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.240
Maybe the area is kind of previous.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.520
No, I'm, I'm agreeing with Chris in person.

07:25.520 --> 07:29.320
It's clear that that area, someone, I don't know, threw down a cigarette and

07:29.320 --> 07:31.960
got burnt and everything else is super lush and green.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.760
So I think the burnt part is actually a great tip because it's the only area

07:37.240 --> 07:40.120
around there that sort of looks like that.

07:40.200 --> 07:44.560
And Chris, when you had me in person, try to find it just based on our little,

07:44.760 --> 07:45.800
this was the first one we dropped.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.920
So he was like, okay, now try to find it.

07:48.320 --> 07:51.040
I had a hard time because I didn't have any hints, but I think that

07:51.040 --> 07:52.400
hint is actually a really great one.

07:52.560 --> 07:56.160
Now that leads me to believe, I think someone else grabbed it.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.960
That's just, that's my conclusion.

07:58.080 --> 08:01.040
You could see if you're walking by it, you could see the blue.

08:01.040 --> 08:04.400
I can't show it on camera, but you could see the blue of the lid walking by.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.440
It's actually visible just walking by it.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.800
It's not like, I like that you put a little bit of leaves over it, though.

08:10.040 --> 08:13.120
Yeah, it's a little, it's like little, yeah, it's a little bit, but, um,

08:13.120 --> 08:15.680
wasn't the lid red, it looks blue in the picture.

08:15.680 --> 08:16.080
Uh-oh.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.720
Brent, get it together.

08:17.760 --> 08:18.640
How burnt was it?

08:23.040 --> 08:23.680
You know, all right.

08:23.840 --> 08:28.920
So, uh, you can come at me with my hiding styles or what lids I use, but the reality

08:28.920 --> 08:30.640
is I think it was one of the first ones found.

08:30.800 --> 08:34.240
So therefore one of the most successful, Wes is being thus most successful.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.600
At least by one measure.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.760
But anyways, we should do more of these because clearly there's not enough.

08:39.840 --> 08:42.120
That's amazing that they're two different listeners at the same time.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.880
We're out there better get out there while the weather's still good.

08:45.360 --> 08:48.720
And Jared finishes, we had fun looking for it, nonetheless, and my daughter

08:48.720 --> 08:50.400
implored me to get out there sooner.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.880
The next time we have another geocache to find.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.400
So thank you for putting it out there.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.240
It was great meeting everyone at the Sacramento meetup and having this

08:58.240 --> 08:59.680
fun little activity along with it.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.200
Yeah.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.880
Uh, you know what makes me just want to travel again a little bit, which is good.

09:03.880 --> 09:06.160
I thought maybe I thought maybe my travel bone would be broken.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.640
Although I have to say with the weather, what it is, I'm looking

09:08.640 --> 09:09.920
forward to just hunkering down for a bit.

09:09.920 --> 09:13.040
And, uh, I got plenty of projects to work on.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.040
Oh yes, you do.

09:14.080 --> 09:17.000
And the biggest for me personally, although probably not for the whole

09:17.000 --> 09:20.840
family is my new home server to replace my dad, raspberry pie server.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.240
Rest in peace, little buddy.

09:22.680 --> 09:23.000
Yeah.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.800
It's time came too soon.

09:25.480 --> 09:28.120
However, the timing could not have been more perfect.

09:29.240 --> 09:33.280
I was pretty bummed when the server died because my home

09:33.280 --> 09:34.760
assistant setup was very complex.

09:34.760 --> 09:38.560
I got like a lot of devices and I was like, I'm going to have to

09:38.560 --> 09:42.960
a lot of devices and it was responsible for a lot of the automation.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.480
But then additionally, like we just talked about, um, on the pre-show,

09:46.880 --> 09:49.840
I like having my media locally because I'm often on a mobile connection.

09:49.880 --> 09:50.200
Yeah.

09:51.680 --> 09:54.920
And so I also had it serving up local media.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.480
I have it doing all of our documentation and Markdown.

09:57.520 --> 09:58.960
I had it running our DNS.

09:58.960 --> 10:03.880
I had it running all kinds of things like smoke ping and, uh, sync

10:03.880 --> 10:06.400
thing and, um, the heart of the RV.

10:06.560 --> 10:06.840
Yeah.

10:06.840 --> 10:11.920
And it died when I was down in Pasadena for the JPL tour, it was

10:11.920 --> 10:17.480
back up in Sacramento dying and I didn't even know it, but the timing

10:17.800 --> 10:21.960
was like unbelievable because when I arrived home from our road trip, my

10:21.960 --> 10:26.520
home assistant yellow was sitting on the porch, just amazing.

10:26.560 --> 10:29.320
After a year, I could crowds, I crowdfunded that thing like a year ago.

10:30.040 --> 10:30.680
It shows up.

10:31.080 --> 10:34.880
And so I get, uh, I get my home assistant set up going and it's rock.

10:34.880 --> 10:39.160
And I talked about that and self-hosted recently, then right around the same

10:39.160 --> 10:46.160
time, hard kernel folks announced the O droid H3 and the H3 plus, which is

10:46.160 --> 10:48.600
an X86 based raspberry PI alternative.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.920
It starts around $165 for the plus.

10:51.440 --> 10:52.960
So a little spend here, but yeah.

10:53.000 --> 10:53.920
X86.

10:54.080 --> 10:58.480
And you get a quad core Jasper Lake processor, which goes up to 3.3

10:58.480 --> 11:05.200
gigahertz, four cores, it goes up to 64 gigabytes of dual channel DDR4 RAM.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.360
It has an MVME slot.

11:08.440 --> 11:11.280
It has dual 2.5 gigabit NICs.

11:11.280 --> 11:13.520
Oh, I've mentioned it before on the show.

11:13.520 --> 11:17.240
It's like, it was the perfect solution at the moment that my system had died.

11:17.840 --> 11:21.640
And I, I was waiting, I knew I needed to redo part of my setup anyways,

11:21.640 --> 11:25.280
cause I had some home assistant issues, but I just didn't want to, didn't

11:25.280 --> 11:27.800
want to go through all the hassle without also getting a performance

11:27.800 --> 11:32.040
upgrade and then this stuff just, and, and not only did this get announced,

11:32.040 --> 11:33.200
but they actually shipped it on time.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.040
You have it.

11:34.080 --> 11:34.600
I have it.

11:34.960 --> 11:38.560
And so I've been running it in production over the last week or so.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.680
I really banged on it pretty much all weekend.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.800
This is like what I focused on the most when it was raining.

11:43.360 --> 11:47.160
And, um, I am going to give it a Hardy endorsement.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.960
I give this one the LUP seal of approval.

11:50.200 --> 11:54.080
If you're looking for a low power device, when this thing is running idle, just kind

11:54.080 --> 11:58.480
of, and I would define idle as your services are loaded, but nothing's really

11:58.480 --> 12:04.000
being taxed 1.5 Watts for an X86 box.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.320
I can run any X86 application.

12:06.320 --> 12:10.360
I want, it's got a modern Intel processor with quick sync.

12:10.640 --> 12:14.360
I've got super fast storage, 1.5 Watts.

12:14.640 --> 12:18.000
That seems amazing and impossible, but how does it compare to arm stuff?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.880
Is it, it must be in the same area.

12:19.880 --> 12:20.520
It's around there.

12:20.560 --> 12:21.680
That is crazy.

12:21.680 --> 12:24.080
Where it, it can go up a little higher.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.760
I think it's depending on your load.

12:26.160 --> 12:26.360
Yeah.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.160
What you're doing with it.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.360
I actually, I haven't really seen a lot of that.

12:29.360 --> 12:30.840
How does it feel to be back on X86?

12:30.840 --> 12:33.680
I feel like another way to spin this little segment is a Chris abandoned arm.

12:33.840 --> 12:37.000
Well, I don't know about abandoning arm forever, but I am done with the

12:37.000 --> 12:40.920
raspberry PI I no way, not compared to this.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.120
This blows it away.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.080
Oh, it's I'm done with the PI.

12:44.880 --> 12:45.400
Seriously.

12:45.400 --> 12:46.680
I never thought this day would happen.

12:46.720 --> 12:47.920
Are you feeling okay?

12:48.160 --> 12:50.320
It's the storage, it's the CPU.

12:50.320 --> 12:55.840
It's the two SATA ports having a, so I also picked up a four terabyte

12:56.240 --> 13:00.000
Saturdays from Amazon for like a ridiculously great price.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.520
And I hooked it up over SATA and now I have, I've gone from USB

13:04.520 --> 13:06.560
storage to actual SATA storage.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.920
And the only thing I'm not really satisfied so far with the

13:08.920 --> 13:10.360
old droid would be the cases.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.200
They're kind of clunky.

13:12.280 --> 13:13.200
They're kind of rough.

13:14.080 --> 13:17.720
They're a good price, but if anybody knows the better cases, I

13:17.720 --> 13:18.760
would definitely be interested.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.840
Have you had a chance to play with the dual NICs yet?

13:20.840 --> 13:22.200
Cause I'm real curious about that.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.600
No, I only, I'm only using one.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.720
I don't actually need dual in this, but not buying raspberry pies anymore.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.560
So like when I do eventually get this firewall set, we get a firewall

13:29.560 --> 13:30.320
set up here at the studio.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.240
I'm going to go with one of these.

13:31.720 --> 13:32.800
I'm done with the raspberry PI.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.000
I'll find something to do with a few of them I have left, I guess,

13:36.640 --> 13:38.080
but it's just so much better.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.160
Melt them down in a sort of ceremonial.

13:41.080 --> 13:44.000
No, I mean, I'll use them for something, but I don't know.

13:44.000 --> 13:44.880
Maybe mine Monero.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.520
I've got another question for you.

13:46.520 --> 13:50.760
I noticed there's a massive fan on that case, which in one way is probably

13:50.760 --> 13:52.840
good because it's quiet or quieter.

13:53.480 --> 13:56.240
I'm curious, have you had a sense of the heat output on that thing?

13:56.640 --> 13:57.640
I'm not pushing it a lot.

13:57.680 --> 14:00.720
So I've been checking it and now I'm also monitoring the booth, you know,

14:00.720 --> 14:03.440
cause it's in the booth and the temperatures are all totally normal.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.720
So I don't have a fan on mine.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.520
The case does have room for a fan.

14:07.520 --> 14:11.840
It does not come with a fan, but they sell a series of accessories for this thing.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.760
Including a fan, if you want to run it with a SATA disk, make sure you get a

14:15.760 --> 14:17.280
power cable because you're going to need that.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.880
It doesn't, it doesn't come with that.

14:20.600 --> 14:23.760
Well, one of the things that's made this real great, got to give a shout out to

14:23.760 --> 14:26.320
Nix, never saw that coming.

14:26.640 --> 14:32.760
So what I did before I decided to deploy this thing is I took my dev one because

14:32.760 --> 14:36.160
I'm, I was getting a new, can pave it to put fedora on there anyways for testing.

14:36.200 --> 14:40.840
So before I did that last week, I, uh, put a fan on it and it was, it was

14:40.840 --> 14:45.720
working, I did a minimal Nix install and started configuring it.

14:45.720 --> 14:49.600
Like I was going to set up the Odroid on my dev one laptop.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.440
So I got jelly fins set up.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.040
I got my storage mounted where I wanted it with everything in the

14:54.040 --> 14:55.840
right file systems and all that.

14:56.320 --> 15:00.520
Got all, got all this stuff kind of preloaded and configured, figured out

15:00.520 --> 15:03.680
what I didn't like, fixed a few things, got some tweaks going.

15:03.720 --> 15:04.080
Yeah.

15:04.520 --> 15:07.720
And then when all the parts arrive for the Odroid, which is really, I was waiting

15:07.720 --> 15:12.920
for it, I just sat down and I decided to do a GUI install because I'm lazy.

15:13.400 --> 15:17.080
And also I just wanted to run, I wanted to get the Odroid all the way up to a GUI

15:17.080 --> 15:17.720
again, right?

15:17.720 --> 15:20.360
So make sure everything was there, test the networking, test everything.

15:20.840 --> 15:26.560
And so I went and I grabbed the NixOS gnome installer and ran that, did a live

15:26.560 --> 15:29.240
session, made sure everything was working, made sure I could see the storage.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.040
Everything was good.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.440
Cause I brought the disks with me.

15:31.880 --> 15:37.240
I had them attached to the dev one over USB, but on the Odroid, I

15:37.240 --> 15:39.440
had them installed over SATA, but it all still worked.

15:39.440 --> 15:39.760
No problem.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.520
It was still dev SDA on both of them.

15:41.520 --> 15:42.000
Perfect.

15:43.160 --> 15:47.280
So I get everything going, launch the installer and I choose the minimal

15:47.280 --> 15:49.080
install option, which is fantastic.

15:49.080 --> 15:52.600
So when it's all done, it reboots into a headless setup, essentially,

15:53.200 --> 15:54.840
and a real minimal config.

15:55.360 --> 16:00.120
And so then I just SSH in, drop my config that I kind of built over a week on the

16:00.120 --> 16:04.760
dev one onto the Odroid, do the old Nix config rebuild.

16:04.760 --> 16:08.280
And, uh, within like, I don't know, 15 minutes, I mean, maybe not even that

16:08.280 --> 16:10.320
the thing was crazy fast and it's pretty minimal install.

16:10.880 --> 16:16.040
I rebooted and I had everything and you're done and like everything worked.

16:16.080 --> 16:17.080
It was incredible.

16:17.080 --> 16:22.240
And I opted to use containers for a couple of things instead of using the

16:22.240 --> 16:25.320
next package manager of mostly for my media stuff.

16:25.320 --> 16:31.120
So sync thing, jellyfin that's all via container, but then things like net data

16:31.120 --> 16:35.480
and duplicati and all, of course, all of like the command line tools, that's all

16:35.480 --> 16:37.160
installed via the Nix system.

16:37.800 --> 16:43.880
I'm thinking this is going to be a really solid long-term install because I have

16:43.880 --> 16:45.600
rollback capabilities with Nix now.

16:46.160 --> 16:50.000
And it's a pretty minimal base install and config, and it's all just

16:50.000 --> 16:51.280
defined in that config file.

16:51.280 --> 16:52.040
Easy to back up.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.720
Easy to, I already have it backed up.

16:54.160 --> 16:58.360
And so I think I can just keep that base system rolling and I'll just update the

16:58.360 --> 17:01.320
application containers that I run in containers over time.

17:01.640 --> 17:03.920
And I think with the performance of the Odroid.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.320
You're not going to be super taxing this box all the time, right?

17:06.320 --> 17:09.200
So we can just kind of sit there, hum along, do what you need it to.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.920
I think I'm going to get a quick sync as you said, so it's not even going to have

17:11.920 --> 17:13.360
to be like too hassled there.

17:13.560 --> 17:16.280
Years, years, Wes, years.

17:16.360 --> 17:17.840
I'm going to get years of use out of this.

17:17.840 --> 17:19.640
Wait, but then what are you going to do if you're not constantly

17:19.640 --> 17:20.720
rebuilding your home server?

17:20.840 --> 17:22.840
I'm going to be buying more of these things and putting them in all kinds of

17:22.840 --> 17:23.360
places.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.880
I mean, I ended up with like four raspberry pies over time.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.680
This is so it really, they hit it out of the park.

17:27.680 --> 17:32.480
The 1.5 Watts at idle matters a lot because there are long stretches of time

17:32.480 --> 17:33.520
where I'm running off solar.

17:33.680 --> 17:37.520
And so anything that runs consistently matters, even if it's just a couple of

17:37.520 --> 17:42.200
Watts over a 24 hour period time or a, you know, a week, that really adds up.

17:42.400 --> 17:42.600
Okay.

17:42.600 --> 17:42.920
Okay.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.320
Do you think you could do a show off?

17:46.400 --> 17:53.400
I was wondering, I was wondering, um, definitely, definitely fed a PCI slot.

17:54.040 --> 17:54.560
Definitely.

17:54.560 --> 17:54.840
Yeah.

17:54.840 --> 18:01.840
But, you know, the disc guy, it was really fast, maybe, it would depend on

18:01.840 --> 18:05.040
the CPU and all that, but maybe I've thought about, I've thought about,

18:05.040 --> 18:06.120
could these be used as a desktop?

18:06.600 --> 18:07.600
Swap out the studio.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.120
You know, we got to replace these studio rigs.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.080
That's actually what I was thinking is the Reaper machine.

18:12.520 --> 18:17.440
I was thinking because it'd be silent, tiny little thing, more space below here

18:17.440 --> 18:18.360
for fun snacks.

18:18.520 --> 18:19.440
Cheap, right?

18:19.440 --> 18:23.080
I love how your, your thoughts, what, two weeks ago was to put out a

18:23.080 --> 18:27.000
Thalio in place, and now you're talking about putting this right there.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.600
No, the Thalios, no, the Thalios is going to, no, no.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.000
The Thalios is for the OBS machine.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.440
That's sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.440
We might get that ordered tomorrow morning, but for the Reaper machine.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.520
That's a different, that's a different set of requirements.

18:38.880 --> 18:39.600
It might work.

18:39.760 --> 18:40.360
It might work.

18:40.720 --> 18:40.840
Yeah.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.160
I'm very, very impressed.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.680
And I've done two separate orders.

18:45.680 --> 18:50.080
So I ordered the Odroid and then I also had to order a, like a cable pack and

18:50.080 --> 18:52.960
stuff, and I'm like, okay, I'm going to order a Thalios.

18:52.960 --> 18:58.640
Bull shipments were just, I mean, not as quick as Amazon, but within a few

18:58.640 --> 19:00.400
days they arrived, no problem.

19:01.120 --> 19:02.560
Like, no supply chain issue.

19:02.560 --> 19:03.240
Availability feels good.

19:03.400 --> 19:03.760
Yeah.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.840
I'm very, very impressed.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.800
That matters when you need a replacement in a pinch or, you know, the next piece

19:08.800 --> 19:09.600
for your next project.

19:10.040 --> 19:13.280
So I'm going to get, uh, going to get just things kind of dialed in on this thing

19:13.280 --> 19:13.440
now.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.480
I got tail scale set up on it last night.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.360
And so that's, that's going now.

19:17.360 --> 19:23.120
And I got, um, a real kind of nice, clean, like I really took everything I've kind

19:23.120 --> 19:27.240
of figured out over the last couple of years since I built the Raspberry Pi and

19:27.240 --> 19:28.320
applied it to this one.

19:28.600 --> 19:28.720
Yeah.

19:28.720 --> 19:31.760
It's my first Raspberry Pi builds were Raspberry Pi OS.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.200
And that just doesn't make for a good server.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.120
What a world ago that was.

19:37.160 --> 19:41.040
And then my second generation, which is what my PI server was that died.

19:41.360 --> 19:44.560
My second generation of Raspberry Pi builds was all based on Ubuntu, I think

19:44.560 --> 19:48.360
2004, their first LTS that officially supported the PI.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.400
And I got to give Ubuntu credit.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.680
It worked really, really well.

19:52.960 --> 19:58.000
It did a very good job for what I needed, but there's a lot there compared to a

19:58.000 --> 19:59.080
minimal Nix install.

19:59.280 --> 20:02.840
There's so much more installed on that Ubuntu system and so many more services

20:02.840 --> 20:05.680
and like snap stuff that I didn't want on the server.

20:05.720 --> 20:08.880
Just a bunch of things you don't particularly care about that might be nice

20:08.880 --> 20:11.480
on a more generic server, but not for what you're doing here.

20:11.480 --> 20:17.480
And there was something really nice about getting a, kind of like having a system

20:17.480 --> 20:21.720
to make mistakes on, on the dev one and do things wrong a couple of times.

20:22.040 --> 20:25.640
Cause like one of the things I did the first time is I tried to just do JellyFin

20:25.880 --> 20:27.400
as just using Nix.

20:27.640 --> 20:27.800
Yeah.

20:28.280 --> 20:31.360
And one of the things I discovered is that presently, although they're working on

20:31.360 --> 20:35.160
it, but presently they have an older version of JellyFin packaged in Nix.

20:35.320 --> 20:38.520
You think of it as a rolling distro, it's got everything brand new, but in this

20:38.520 --> 20:40.200
case, JellyFin was actually out of date.

20:40.200 --> 20:44.440
And there are solutions to solve that on Nix, but then I also have to solve it for

20:44.440 --> 20:47.160
FFmpeg because I need a version of FFmpeg that works with JellyFin.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.920
And then I also have to solve it for this plugin that I'm using.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.560
That's based on a certain version of JellyFin.

20:51.560 --> 20:55.760
It kind of just started becoming like this rabbit hole of like fixing stuff to

20:55.760 --> 20:58.920
make it use the Nix system versus I could just go get the container that just had

20:58.920 --> 20:59.200
it all.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.320
And obviously NixOS runs containers just fine.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.120
Exactly.

21:02.680 --> 21:06.200
So that was sort of one of the things I realized on my test system was like,

21:06.280 --> 21:07.440
maybe I won't do it this way.

21:07.480 --> 21:07.760
Yeah.

21:07.760 --> 21:10.720
I can see it's nice not having to worry about containers and not worrying about

21:10.720 --> 21:16.480
any of that, but for these media applications, Plex2, the creators of these

21:16.480 --> 21:20.160
containers have done things to optimize like hardware transcoding and stuff like

21:20.160 --> 21:20.400
that.

21:20.720 --> 21:24.080
And you probably, a lot of these, like you don't really want to look inside,

21:24.080 --> 21:24.280
right?

21:24.280 --> 21:24.760
You don't really care.

21:24.760 --> 21:27.480
Like as long as it works and it pops up its web interface and like does the thing,

21:27.480 --> 21:29.520
you're not trying to go mess inside the container anyway.

21:29.520 --> 21:29.680
Yeah.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.000
It's not like a, it's not like a core business tool.

21:32.480 --> 21:35.280
It's how I just want to watch something on my TV and I just want to watch something

21:35.280 --> 21:35.680
on my TV.

21:35.680 --> 21:35.880
Damn it.

21:35.880 --> 21:38.720
You know, now when it goes down, it suddenly becomes a core business tool,

21:38.720 --> 21:40.760
but you know, yeah, right.

21:41.080 --> 21:41.800
No kidding.

21:42.480 --> 21:47.040
Uh, at least for me, but, um, you know, I, so I made those mistakes, fixed them.

21:47.080 --> 21:50.640
And the beautiful thing is, and then I'm all done on this, but the thing I just

21:50.640 --> 21:56.760
effing love about Nix is the moment I realized, yeah, this is probably better

21:56.760 --> 21:57.480
as a container.

21:58.120 --> 22:02.400
I just went and commented out the stuff I added to the Nix config, rebuilt, and it

22:02.400 --> 22:04.280
was like, I never installed Jellyfish.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.200
It was like, it was never there.

22:07.440 --> 22:08.960
It was a totally clean system again.

22:08.960 --> 22:09.800
So nice.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.360
It's so nice.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.480
And then I just went and got the container and it's like, never did that.

22:14.480 --> 22:15.520
Nothing, nothing.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.880
You know, just pretend like I never made that mistake that you can just have

22:18.880 --> 22:22.240
access to this giant array of software that you can just sort of arbitrarily

22:22.240 --> 22:26.000
compose together into different systems whenever you want in different ways,

22:26.000 --> 22:27.320
which everyone works better for me too.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.720
It's such a great platform in that regard.

22:29.760 --> 22:33.280
And you just have to invest the time and, and you have to, you know,

22:33.280 --> 22:36.480
invest the time in educating yourself to figure out which one works right.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.200
And sometimes you just have to do it the hard way, like I did.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.080
Try it one way, but I love that.

22:40.080 --> 22:43.360
And then, and then the thing that makes it so great is I just pick that config

22:43.360 --> 22:48.760
file up, drop it on the new rig, rebuild, off to the races and done.

22:49.120 --> 22:53.720
So it was a real success and getting the Odroid up and going combined with the

22:53.720 --> 22:59.120
compatibility of x86, but the power usage of like a traditional ARM system really

22:59.120 --> 23:00.040
hitting the sweet spot for me.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.480
Hey, good job x86, I guess too, huh?

23:02.480 --> 23:03.280
That's that's impressive.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.640
Linode.com slash unplugged.

23:08.760 --> 23:11.920
That's where you go to get a hundred dollars in 60 day credit for a new account.

23:12.280 --> 23:15.400
And it's a great way to support the show while you're checking out something

23:15.400 --> 23:17.680
pretty great, IE Linode.

23:17.960 --> 23:21.200
Linode is easy to use and powerful cloud hosting.

23:21.240 --> 23:24.560
They have 11 data centers around the world, soon to be like another

23:24.760 --> 23:26.280
dozen over the next year.

23:26.960 --> 23:30.480
But really I think the key thing is that a really solid Linux infrastructure.

23:30.480 --> 23:33.920
They make it super quick to deploy systems and you get to choose from a

23:33.920 --> 23:37.800
very wide range of Linux distributions, pretty much all the great distros.

23:37.800 --> 23:41.880
And there's even guides on how to build it up from the ground up.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.160
We've done that a couple of times for various reasons.

23:44.600 --> 23:50.800
They now also offer bare metal servers and we use the absolute snot out of

23:50.800 --> 23:53.000
their S3 compatible object storage.

23:53.320 --> 23:55.000
That's what's behind our peer tube instance.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.760
That's what's behind our next cloud instance for our team here.

23:57.760 --> 24:01.280
It's just kind of like our go to solution for anything that's going to

24:01.280 --> 24:02.960
sort of have a various amount of data.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.960
I don't want to like slice off this like, like an old caveman or something.

24:07.360 --> 24:11.040
They have a brilliant VLAN support where you can actually bridge different

24:11.040 --> 24:14.040
Linode data centers together, a powerful DNS manager.

24:14.040 --> 24:16.240
They support Kubernetes, Ansible and Terraform.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.440
If you're using that tooling, super fast networking because they are their own

24:21.440 --> 24:25.320
ISP and their pricing is 30 to 50% cheaper than the other major cloud

24:25.320 --> 24:26.120
providers out there.

24:26.120 --> 24:28.760
And they're a true, genuine Linux loving company.

24:28.760 --> 24:32.200
They started because they saw what you could do with VMs and Linux before,

24:32.520 --> 24:35.960
before there ever was an AWS or cloud hosting, as we call it.

24:36.360 --> 24:39.440
And because of that, they built a company around the merits of the product, the

24:39.440 --> 24:43.880
capabilities, the speed, the features, the reliability, and the support.

24:44.760 --> 24:50.880
They have 365, 24 seven support by phone, top tier support when you call them.

24:51.280 --> 24:54.360
Additionally, they have tons of resources on their website.

24:54.360 --> 24:59.240
Just a couple of days ago, they posted a, how to revert your last Git commit

24:59.240 --> 24:59.760
tutorial.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.520
This is really just a tutorial to get you going on Git.

25:03.240 --> 25:06.560
We talk about it all the time here, but what about some practical examples?

25:07.360 --> 25:09.760
How do you actually roll things back when you make a mistake?

25:10.160 --> 25:11.680
They've got an absolutely free tutorial.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.920
It's really nothing Linode specific about it.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.560
It's just about getting you those skills.

25:15.560 --> 25:20.640
And then I think they hope something you'll be able to use on Linode, get even

25:20.720 --> 25:22.200
more out of Linode, I would imagine.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.520
Lots of great tutorials. I'll put a link to this one.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.000
How to revert your last Git commit.

25:26.000 --> 25:26.800
What a great guide.

25:27.680 --> 25:28.960
I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.640
I love that kind of stuff about Linode.

25:30.680 --> 25:34.800
Great online resources, great technical resources in the company and a website

25:34.800 --> 25:35.600
that I've noticed.

25:36.240 --> 25:39.720
Everyone on our team at various skill levels can use to manage the systems.

25:40.320 --> 25:41.440
It's really fantastic.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.640
And their community support runs super deep as well.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.120
So go get that hundred dollars and support the show.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.920
You go to linode.com slash unplugged.

25:48.920 --> 25:51.800
That's linode.com slash unplugged.

25:55.240 --> 25:58.280
We do have some housekeeping to get to this week.

25:58.760 --> 26:02.200
I think number one, we got to talk about, I promised to try to bring it up earlier

26:02.200 --> 26:03.640
and I'm already sliding on that.

26:03.920 --> 26:05.560
The tuxes are coming up.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.880
So we're getting serious about this year's tuxes and we're looking for people to

26:08.880 --> 26:13.080
help us maybe organize it, work on the submissions, get the questions in better

26:13.080 --> 26:16.160
shape. I have launched a tuxes boardroom.

26:16.160 --> 26:19.640
Put your tuxes on folks. Yeah, get your best on and come join us.

26:19.640 --> 26:22.920
We'll have a link in the show notes if you'd like to join us in Matrix and help us

26:22.920 --> 26:28.200
organize this. Or you can go to bit.ly slash tuxes board and that'll take you there.

26:28.200 --> 26:30.320
Tuxes board. Who doesn't want to go there?

26:30.520 --> 26:34.840
And we'd love to have you join us in there and help make the tuxes the best awards

26:34.840 --> 26:36.640
ever. It's the number one award show.

26:36.680 --> 26:41.480
I mean, we have, you know, out there, there's a lot of really great projects and we

26:41.480 --> 26:45.160
won't help you out there, but we want to make sure that you get the tuxes board.

26:45.160 --> 26:47.640
We won't help trying to try to honor them.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.880
Yeah. Is that next cloud instance?

26:49.880 --> 26:52.760
It's still up, right? I got to start it with a little blank entry.

26:52.760 --> 26:53.920
We can start crafting. Yeah.

26:53.920 --> 26:55.800
So if we could find enemy, we could work on it.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.480
Perhaps somebody feels like they do a better job.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.040
Yeah, definitely possible.

27:00.040 --> 27:03.520
We're already sliding. Then we could give them access to the next cloud instance.

27:03.520 --> 27:06.960
And that's where we have the forum that gets composed over there.

27:07.120 --> 27:10.600
And if you have ideas on things that we didn't get in the tuxes last year, that

27:10.600 --> 27:14.120
should be in the tuxes, you can boost them into the show or you can join that Matrix

27:14.120 --> 27:16.680
chat room and let us know as well.

27:17.240 --> 27:21.760
Now, there is an event going on, kicks off tomorrow as we record and it runs through

27:21.760 --> 27:25.240
the ninth. It's something that we haven't said for a long time.

27:25.240 --> 27:28.520
It's been gone. It's been missing from the community calendar.

27:28.760 --> 27:32.560
And it is the Ubuntu Summit 2022.

27:32.720 --> 27:38.600
It's back. And Brent wanted to get you all, I guess, up to date on it, I guess.

27:39.120 --> 27:39.880
You can't go.

27:39.880 --> 27:44.880
I noticed that there's registration for kind of tuning in remotely.

27:44.880 --> 27:49.320
I don't think all the talks are being streamed, but I think the main room is being

27:49.320 --> 27:52.680
streamed. So they have a bunch of tracks, including the Ubuntu desktop, of course,

27:52.680 --> 27:57.720
which seems obvious, but some community tracks and data science, app ecosystems,

27:57.720 --> 28:02.000
infrastructure, devices and content and design, which is, you know, close to my

28:02.000 --> 28:06.440
heart. And so I just thought, you know, the people should know this is happening.

28:06.440 --> 28:11.520
I know you can go ahead and register right now for some remote viewing stuff.

28:11.520 --> 28:16.680
I wasn't able to find a link right away to where it's going to be streamed, but I'm

28:16.680 --> 28:20.120
sure they've got that all figured out and we'll probably get an email or something

28:20.120 --> 28:23.000
with where it's going to be at. So that's my little PSA.

28:23.840 --> 28:28.840
That's great. There was a possibility the JB team was going to make it, but it just

28:28.840 --> 28:31.320
didn't work out scheduling wise.

28:31.320 --> 28:34.000
So hopefully this will become a trend that they'll keep doing.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.400
It certainly seems like Canonical's really excited about it, and I'm really curious to

28:38.400 --> 28:43.600
see what this new era of celebrating the really awesome Ubuntu community that exists is

28:43.600 --> 28:47.440
like. There's a lot of neat folks in it and participating and helping it grow and, you

28:47.440 --> 28:48.880
know, keep it diverse and active.

28:49.520 --> 28:52.240
It's nice to see these kinds of things showing up more.

28:52.440 --> 28:58.800
I agree. It's something that I'm really happy to see because it brings all the

28:58.800 --> 29:03.960
stakeholders together in a way that can help make the Linux platform better, regardless

29:03.960 --> 29:06.320
of which distribution you're using.

29:06.720 --> 29:08.640
Yeah, message we can all get behind.

29:09.320 --> 29:14.160
I will say, if you are planning on joining in, it is happening in Prague, and so you

29:14.160 --> 29:16.160
might have to check the time zones on that one.

29:16.160 --> 29:21.040
I think if you're in the Pacific Northwest, it starts at like 1 a.m.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.320
tonight. So that's something to take into account.

29:23.400 --> 29:24.600
Just check their calendars.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.640
I'm sure they make it nice and easy for you to figure it out.

29:27.280 --> 29:31.440
It would be great if they posted the videos on something like YouTube so people could

29:31.440 --> 29:33.720
see what it's about. I can tell you just from behind the scenes.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.440
It seems like they're very serious about this.

29:35.440 --> 29:39.320
They're really committed to it, just communicating diligently with us.

29:39.440 --> 29:43.520
And they're clearly trying to bring in as many people as they can and cover a wide

29:43.520 --> 29:46.520
range of topics. I used to love these things.

29:46.520 --> 29:50.360
Yeah. So here's hoping that this becomes an ongoing yearly thing.

29:50.400 --> 29:54.680
And I think it also shows a sign that Canonical is willing to spend real money to

29:54.680 --> 30:00.320
invest in the community, because I have a sense they are flying in a lot of people.

30:00.320 --> 30:06.240
And the cost of that and stay and all of that and the food is just astronomical.

30:06.480 --> 30:08.480
So it's a big commitment.

30:09.360 --> 30:10.480
And then also just a PSA.

30:10.480 --> 30:13.960
We're going to take a look at Fedora 37 next week on the show.

30:13.960 --> 30:18.520
So if you'd like to download it and try it out and join us, join us.

30:18.560 --> 30:22.040
Yeah. You can either listen along with it or join us in the Mumble Room.

30:22.600 --> 30:25.600
Of course, we'll be live noon Pacific, 3 p.m.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.160
Eastern over at Jupiter got to.

30:27.160 --> 30:33.520
And then last but not least, also on our radar, the end of year holiday loves.

30:33.520 --> 30:36.600
They're coming up. You can boost in your prediction or you send an email.

30:37.000 --> 30:41.200
I was thinking people could use 20, 23 sets for their for their predictions.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.120
Oh, I like that.

30:42.120 --> 30:46.560
Go to Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact to send in your predictions to start

30:46.560 --> 30:50.400
collecting some of them and then Brent will read through them and steal a few of them.

30:50.880 --> 30:53.080
Of course. Maybe I will, too.

30:54.440 --> 30:55.440
I'm looking forward to it.

30:55.440 --> 30:59.480
It's been a while because last year, it's been a while since we've done our pre-record

30:59.480 --> 31:02.760
format for them, because last year luck just missed all the major holidays.

31:03.160 --> 31:07.200
But this year we're going to land smack dab, I think, on Christmas or Christmas Eve or

31:07.200 --> 31:08.480
something like that. I believe so.

31:08.480 --> 31:11.000
And then and then New Year's.

31:11.320 --> 31:13.480
Yeah. So there's that's right.

31:13.520 --> 31:14.520
So there's that. Yeah.

31:15.080 --> 31:17.800
So we're going to probably pre-record that so that I'll be coming up on the calendar at

31:17.800 --> 31:19.440
Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.320
But that's why we're putting the word out now.

31:21.640 --> 31:22.800
We need your help. Yeah.

31:22.800 --> 31:26.000
Because it'll be coming up sooner than you'd think since we're pre-recording.

31:26.480 --> 31:30.480
So if you want to get your predictions in, boost them in 2023 with a little prediction.

31:30.840 --> 31:33.880
And you know, we need help if you've listened to any of the previous prediction.

31:33.880 --> 31:34.880
You do know, right?

31:35.440 --> 31:38.280
Seriously, although I think maybe this is what it was my better.

31:38.280 --> 31:39.920
Yeah, you're going to crush it.

31:39.920 --> 31:42.360
Maybe I just don't read it already.

31:43.080 --> 31:48.640
Speaking of boosts, we got one from Mike Piso 1970 and he sent in two hundred and

31:48.640 --> 31:54.480
twenty two thousand two hundred and twenty two I'm a duck.

31:54.480 --> 32:00.320
D.U.K. duck loaded with talent and it's also a big baller music.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.760
Ice is Chris, Wes and Brent.

32:04.080 --> 32:07.360
I've been a listener since episode one hundred and twenty five.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.360
Oh, just a little after you started, Wes.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.800
I usually just listen and then just consume the information.

32:12.800 --> 32:17.400
Rarely do I comment or interact with the hosts of media, but I wanted to give back for all

32:17.400 --> 32:21.320
that I've learned now that the Lightning Network allows me to do so for the first time I've

32:21.320 --> 32:25.880
invested in Bitcoin, changed my podcast app, and I'm finally able to give you call two

32:25.880 --> 32:28.680
thousand two hundred and twenty two a row of ducks.

32:28.840 --> 32:33.080
Well, for my first boost ever, I am sending in you a row of super ducks.

32:33.320 --> 32:36.680
That's where the two hundred and twenty two thousand two hundred and twenty two sats comes

32:36.680 --> 32:39.320
from. Things are looking up for all that duck.

32:39.880 --> 32:41.720
Thank you so much for everything.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.240
Well, Mike, thank you.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.440
Yeah, no kidding.

32:44.440 --> 32:50.680
And Mike, you you don't even realize it, but you also put us at the top of the fountain

32:51.240 --> 32:53.320
hot list for Friday night, Saturday morning.

32:53.720 --> 32:57.000
So we picked up a new batch of listeners thanks to your boost.

32:57.320 --> 32:58.360
That's so amazing.

32:58.360 --> 33:04.280
On top of that, you came in at a really great week because our node was down twice, once

33:04.280 --> 33:07.880
due to a software upgrade and once due to a very long power outage.

33:08.280 --> 33:10.680
And so we missed a lot of boosts.

33:10.680 --> 33:13.800
And so I appreciate that very much.

33:13.800 --> 33:16.360
And this also is the week that John A lost his streak.

33:16.840 --> 33:21.240
Oh, which we still know we we said we we said, yeah, he's welcome.

33:21.240 --> 33:23.240
And he quit boosting. So that tells you something.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.320
But I think he will join us in the studio at some point.

33:25.320 --> 33:27.560
But so thank you very much, Mike.

33:27.560 --> 33:31.080
We really appreciate it. It was sort of the perfect timing, the way it all came together

33:31.080 --> 33:33.720
with your boost and and of course, the generous size of it.

33:33.720 --> 33:37.400
It meant that we picked up some new listeners and I got a note from somebody who said, hey,

33:37.400 --> 33:38.440
I found you in fountain today.

33:38.440 --> 33:41.240
And loving the show. And it's just it's so awesome.

33:41.240 --> 33:47.960
It's such a great thing because a Linux podcast is never going to be at the top of an iTunes

33:47.960 --> 33:49.000
or Spotify chart.

33:49.720 --> 33:52.200
It's never going to be at the top of their store ever.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.760
Well, what about when Joe Rogan's our next guest?

33:54.760 --> 33:59.720
Right. And it's incredible because we're on we're on a list of really, really great podcasts.

33:59.720 --> 34:01.960
And it's it helps people with discovery.

34:01.960 --> 34:07.800
I also love the idea of a new like an old time listener, which also just it's it's it's

34:07.800 --> 34:10.840
also just it's always delightful when, you know, we get to hear from them.

34:10.840 --> 34:11.320
Yeah.

34:11.320 --> 34:13.880
Inspires a new listener to like that's that's just amazing.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.440
It's also it's like price of Bitcoin is going to be low for a while.

34:16.440 --> 34:17.400
It's a great time to experiment.

34:17.400 --> 34:18.280
Sats are cheap.

34:18.280 --> 34:19.160
Experiment.

34:19.160 --> 34:21.720
You know, see how hard it is and play with the different stacks because they're self

34:21.720 --> 34:23.160
hosting involved if you'd like.

34:23.160 --> 34:24.440
And a lot of that.

34:24.440 --> 34:25.400
So it can be a lot of fun.

34:26.120 --> 34:26.440
All right.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.840
So this week, we're three wild and crazy guys.

34:28.840 --> 34:31.240
I have no idea what you all want to talk about.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.720
But I'm really looking forward to these are some of my favorite episodes.

34:35.720 --> 34:38.200
So let's start with Mr. Brentley.

34:38.200 --> 34:40.920
He's been on the road hunting moose and doing family time.

34:40.920 --> 34:43.320
And he's back now in his cottage.

34:43.320 --> 34:44.920
And he's got a topic for us.

34:44.920 --> 34:49.240
Yeah, I am, as some of you might have picked up over the years, a big fan of signal.

34:49.240 --> 34:55.800
And I noticed that there's been kind of a snap signals snafu that happened recently.

34:57.480 --> 35:02.760
There was a the signal snap had a bit of failure on multiple levels that was confusing at first.

35:02.760 --> 35:08.680
But I've dug in and I'm hoping to just kind of touch on it here with the hopes of asking

35:08.680 --> 35:13.400
one or two bigger questions once I'm done explaining what happened.

35:13.400 --> 35:13.960
All right.

35:13.960 --> 35:18.440
OK, yeah, I did hear something about this, like this, like they had to pull the snap

35:18.440 --> 35:19.880
or something from the snap store.

35:20.520 --> 35:23.640
Yeah, as far as I understand, it kind of vanished more so.

35:23.640 --> 35:28.360
And then users who were using the signal snap just saw that it was missing.

35:28.360 --> 35:35.800
And upon investigating with snap list that you can run on the command line, it just indicated

35:35.800 --> 35:39.720
that it was in a snap quarantine, which I had never seen before.

35:39.720 --> 35:40.920
Have you guys seen that before?

35:40.920 --> 35:41.800
I have not.

35:41.800 --> 35:42.840
No, I have not.

35:42.840 --> 35:48.440
So that got me kind of like, oh, well, I like signal and well, snaps can be useful.

35:48.440 --> 35:49.880
And I wonder what happened here.

35:49.880 --> 35:52.760
And it turns out a lot happens.

35:52.760 --> 35:58.440
Mostly a bunch of communication breakdowns from a bunch of different sources.

35:58.440 --> 36:04.440
So those are the communication breakdown between canonical and their volunteer snap maintainer,

36:04.440 --> 36:07.800
Galgalesh or Merlin Sebrecht.

36:07.800 --> 36:11.160
OK, so this is a volunteer maintained signal snap.

36:11.160 --> 36:17.160
Yeah, community maintainer who maintains like an unofficial signal snap, which we've seen

36:17.160 --> 36:20.040
before in, you know, flat hub as well.

36:20.040 --> 36:26.120
Some of these more popular applications are available, but aren't sort of the official

36:26.840 --> 36:31.720
flavor that comes straight from the, you know, for instance, signal developers.

36:31.720 --> 36:36.360
Well, generally, the company doesn't really often even know about flat pack packaging

36:36.360 --> 36:38.600
or snap packaging, or they're not interested in supporting it.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.720
And so somebody in the community is like, well, this is an in-demand app, so I'm going

36:41.720 --> 36:45.480
to step up and I'm going to make sure it's packaged and God bless them.

36:45.480 --> 36:46.200
Yeah.

36:46.200 --> 36:50.040
But sometimes it's like a little bit of a security concern there, too.

36:50.040 --> 36:51.880
I could see, especially with an app like signal.

36:51.880 --> 36:58.360
Yes, it seems signal vanished and users noticed, but the snap maintainer didn't know about

36:58.360 --> 37:04.200
it until they started seeing issues on their issue tracker and also just users saying,

37:04.200 --> 37:05.080
hey, what's going on?

37:05.080 --> 37:09.560
It's kind of missing and they expected to hear from canonical if something would have

37:09.560 --> 37:10.600
changed there.

37:10.600 --> 37:14.200
And so there's this kind of rabbit hole of different information that's a little bit

37:14.200 --> 37:16.120
everywhere that I've tried to put together.

37:16.120 --> 37:23.800
So from what I can tell Marlin, the snap maintainer discovered the problem from users who linked

37:23.800 --> 37:28.200
some snap craft IO forums where users were asking the question, you know, where did the

37:28.200 --> 37:30.040
snap go for a signal?

37:30.040 --> 37:35.880
So Merlin responded, I had to find this out myself from users reporting it on our bug

37:35.880 --> 37:36.440
tracker.

37:36.440 --> 37:40.520
There was an initial communication breakdown between me and canonical due to how the snap

37:40.520 --> 37:45.400
crafters publisher is structured canonical is changing their procedures to make sure

37:45.400 --> 37:48.200
this communication breakdown doesn't happen in the future.

37:48.200 --> 37:52.360
Due to how the snap craft publishers worked canonical was communicating with the wrong

37:52.360 --> 37:54.280
person about the takedown.

37:54.280 --> 37:57.960
They've since amended the process to make sure this doesn't happen anymore.

37:57.960 --> 38:03.240
Now, Daniel Menrique, who works at canonical as a policy reviewer responded.

38:03.240 --> 38:09.080
I have updated the process documentation to be very, very explicit about this.

38:09.080 --> 38:14.520
For future cases, so it sounds like small communication breakdown there that seems understandable

38:14.520 --> 38:22.840
because a huge delay in getting this resolved, but it kind of gets more complex from there.

38:22.840 --> 38:27.960
Okay, so if I'm following they had to do a takedown, they do a takedown, but they don't

38:27.960 --> 38:29.720
know who to notify properly.

38:29.720 --> 38:31.320
So they just do it anyways.

38:31.320 --> 38:35.480
And then through the process of like realizing they didn't notify the right person, they

38:35.480 --> 38:39.960
come up with a new process, which they've now documented, but what's missing for me

38:39.960 --> 38:42.440
is why they had to remove it in the first place.

38:42.440 --> 38:45.960
Why was it so urgent to just rip it out of the snap store?

38:45.960 --> 38:51.000
Well, I'm leading there and the reason I'm making it a bit of a question for you is that

38:51.000 --> 38:55.160
this is exactly how the users felt, so I wanted you to feel exactly how they did.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.720
So there was also a communications breakdown with users.

38:57.720 --> 39:02.200
So at first in some of these threads canonical said the snap store administrators had to

39:02.200 --> 39:05.480
remove the snap in accordance with our policies.

39:05.480 --> 39:09.400
We hope to have it back shortly, and that's kind of all that they wrote in there.

39:09.400 --> 39:14.040
So it was very cryptic, at least from what I can read.

39:14.040 --> 39:22.280
So it turns out that the signal lawyers asked for a DMCA takedown of the signal snap.

39:22.280 --> 39:28.920
And now it's not their official snap offering, so I suppose because of perhaps trademark

39:28.920 --> 39:33.160
issues, that that is definitely something they can do.

39:33.160 --> 39:39.480
Now Merlin, the community maintainer, just wrote a bit more once they did get involved

39:39.480 --> 39:42.040
and dug into it behind the scenes.

39:42.040 --> 39:45.880
This is due to a DMCA takedown request coming from the lawyers representing Signal.

39:45.880 --> 39:49.080
Canonical is currently working with Signal to resolve the issue.

39:49.080 --> 39:53.640
I've suggested to Canonical to be more transparent with DMCA takedown requests, similar to how

39:53.640 --> 39:54.680
GitHub does it.

39:54.680 --> 39:57.480
Last I heard, they were discussing that internally.

39:57.480 --> 40:02.600
Due to how lawyers and legal threats work, Canonical is very hesitant to publicly talk

40:02.600 --> 40:05.160
about what's going on, understandably.

40:05.160 --> 40:09.960
You can expect a thorough postmortem after the legal issues are cleared up.

40:09.960 --> 40:17.000
So I also noticed that Brian Acton actually spoke up about this on Hacker News.

40:17.000 --> 40:22.280
I did not expect to see Brian Acton, the Signal co-founder, leaving a little message there,

40:22.280 --> 40:23.800
which is kind of fun.

40:23.800 --> 40:30.120
He wrote, we spoke to our attorneys and found that there was a breakdown in communication

40:30.120 --> 40:32.280
between us and our attorneys.

40:32.280 --> 40:37.360
We are working to rectify and reinstate the Signal desktop as soon as possible.

40:37.360 --> 40:38.360
Sorry for the confusion.

40:38.360 --> 40:40.200
You don't say.

40:40.200 --> 40:45.920
So the lawyers preemptively went out, discovered this trademark violation, took action on behalf

40:45.920 --> 40:46.920
of their client.

40:46.920 --> 40:49.260
Do they just have like a blank check in which they're operating from?

40:49.260 --> 40:50.600
So that's a good question, you know.

40:50.600 --> 40:54.640
Is that actually the case or is this just them sort of covering their butts a little

40:54.640 --> 40:55.640
bit?

40:55.640 --> 40:56.640
Could be.

40:56.640 --> 40:57.640
The lawyer is always a great one to blame.

40:57.640 --> 40:59.080
I mean, that's part of why you pay them.

40:59.080 --> 41:05.560
But I also could see it being like maybe there's just ongoing trademark protection.

41:05.560 --> 41:07.820
You know, I could see something they would do.

41:07.820 --> 41:08.820
Could be.

41:08.820 --> 41:09.820
Yeah.

41:09.820 --> 41:12.080
I know in the past they've had some issues with having Signal, for instance, in F-Droid

41:12.080 --> 41:13.120
as well.

41:13.120 --> 41:17.560
So there might be a history there that we could dig into a little bit more at some point.

41:17.560 --> 41:22.040
But this whole kind of situation, which is multiple layers of communication breakdowns,

41:22.040 --> 41:26.800
it sounds like, just got me thinking a few questions that I thought we could explore.

41:26.800 --> 41:32.680
And I think the most obvious one is this third party app bundling that's happening for snaps

41:32.680 --> 41:35.160
and also for flat packs.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.800
I just wondered, is it still a good idea?

41:37.800 --> 41:43.520
It was really essential when those platforms and technologies first came to light because,

41:43.520 --> 41:47.320
you know, that's pretty essential to get users on the platforms is to have the apps that

41:47.320 --> 41:50.840
you want to use, like, you know, the commercial ones.

41:50.840 --> 41:56.840
And also, even though this is an open source application, Signal, it still has some trademark

41:56.840 --> 41:57.840
issues there.

41:57.840 --> 42:03.020
So I wondered, now that snaps and flat packs are a bit more mature, should we really have

42:03.020 --> 42:09.840
the original developers be the snap maintainers instead of community members?

42:09.840 --> 42:11.520
I wanted to get your thoughts on that.

42:11.520 --> 42:15.800
Well, but even if snaps are more popular now, or, you know, these types of packages, you

42:15.800 --> 42:19.120
still got to get the maintainers to be interested, right?

42:19.120 --> 42:25.200
Like we wouldn't need it if they were interested in maintaining the snap themselves, we wouldn't

42:25.200 --> 42:26.200
know.

42:26.200 --> 42:27.200
Probably, hopefully none of this would have happened.

42:27.200 --> 42:29.240
Yeah, that seems to be the chicken or the egg problem, isn't it?

42:29.240 --> 42:31.200
And then do you get it on like multiple stores?

42:31.200 --> 42:32.840
Is it going to be snap and flat hubs?

42:32.840 --> 42:33.840
Right.

42:33.840 --> 42:34.840
You know?

42:34.840 --> 42:35.840
Yeah.

42:35.840 --> 42:37.680
And I could see why they're hesitant to commit to that for sure.

42:37.680 --> 42:41.800
I think maybe Canonical has struck the balance here a little better than flat hub has where

42:41.800 --> 42:46.200
they make it pretty clear now after they've had some issues in the past, Thunderbird,

42:46.200 --> 42:48.740
you can see is being published by Canonical.

42:48.740 --> 42:53.240
They make the publisher clear, and then they also have this thing called a verified account.

42:53.240 --> 42:57.440
And then if you go, say, take a look at Slack, here it's very clear that Slack is actually

42:57.440 --> 43:02.220
being published by the Slack group, who has also been verified by Canonical.

43:02.220 --> 43:05.100
And I think that's lessons they learned to try to make that more clear.

43:05.100 --> 43:10.600
But I don't know if A, users are even aware to look for that difference, and B, I don't

43:10.600 --> 43:14.880
know if it really answers the question of what happens when it's something that needs

43:14.880 --> 43:16.800
like significant trust.

43:16.800 --> 43:21.820
Signal comes to mind, maybe like a Bitcoin wallet or something that you would use to

43:21.820 --> 43:26.680
encrypt your files, like something that you want to place a lot of trust into.

43:26.680 --> 43:28.480
Should that be packaged by a third party maintainer?

43:28.480 --> 43:32.160
Or should we only trust it from the original source?

43:32.160 --> 43:35.200
So far in Linux, we've made the trade off and decided, well, the maintainers will do

43:35.200 --> 43:36.200
it.

43:36.200 --> 43:40.060
If you look at a traditional distro, none of the packages in there are generally being

43:40.060 --> 43:42.680
packaged by the upstream person, typically.

43:42.680 --> 43:47.880
For Signal specifically, I've traditionally used their official deb, which seems like

43:47.880 --> 43:49.680
a perfectly fine way to go.

43:49.680 --> 43:54.600
But since we had our summer of immutability, I dove a little bit more into Flatpaks, thanks

43:54.600 --> 43:56.160
to both of you.

43:56.160 --> 44:01.360
And I kind of ran into that issue, which was trying to discover whether it was an official

44:01.360 --> 44:02.360
or not.

44:02.360 --> 44:06.880
And then when I discovered that it wasn't, trying to determine if I should trust these

44:06.880 --> 44:08.320
people or not.

44:08.320 --> 44:14.000
And I tend to love open source and everyone involved as a basic default.

44:14.000 --> 44:18.820
But then the question becomes, well, should I?

44:18.820 --> 44:23.040
And I found that difficult to discover, because you end up going down a rabbit hole and ending

44:23.040 --> 44:28.140
up on the project's GitHub, where there's like three maintainers.

44:28.140 --> 44:29.460
Sometimes there's more than that.

44:29.460 --> 44:32.160
But these are still people that I don't know their association.

44:32.160 --> 44:36.540
So it's a funny little pickle we've got there.

44:36.540 --> 44:40.920
The nature of this whole problem comes down to a very ugly paradox that we don't like

44:40.920 --> 44:41.920
to talk about.

44:41.920 --> 44:48.380
The paradox is, we want all these applications to exist and be available for the medium of

44:48.380 --> 44:55.520
delivery that we need or want to use, but nobody cares.

44:55.520 --> 45:00.680
Because nobody cares, somebody has to do that work in the first place.

45:00.680 --> 45:06.200
And maybe an ISP, because we're going to call them what they are, independent software

45:06.200 --> 45:07.200
vendors.

45:07.200 --> 45:12.720
An ISP will pick some mechanism in which they're going to deliver it, whether it's a tarball,

45:12.720 --> 45:19.800
an app image, an RPM, a deb, or even just like a self extracting shell script, which

45:19.800 --> 45:21.440
is the most horrifying way to do it.

45:21.440 --> 45:27.480
But there you go, they'll pick a method, and it will not be the method you want.

45:27.480 --> 45:32.560
And so somebody has to do that transformation from one method to the other.

45:32.560 --> 45:37.400
And that is never, ever, ever going to stop.

45:37.400 --> 45:42.360
Because there is no incentive for it to stop.

45:42.360 --> 45:44.960
You have tug of wars across all the different dimensions.

45:44.960 --> 45:52.240
So you've got people who are gatekeepers of the software centers, who in the various distributions

45:52.240 --> 45:54.960
will pick one format or the other.

45:54.960 --> 46:03.400
Even if they could enable both, they won't, for either jealousy or ego or because there's

46:03.400 --> 46:06.680
a technical problem or something like that.

46:06.680 --> 46:14.840
And this comes back to a second order of issues that we have, which is that in the open source

46:14.840 --> 46:24.860
space, we have this unwritten contract that there are actually two levels of responsibility

46:24.860 --> 46:25.860
here.

46:25.860 --> 46:29.600
There's the responsibility of the creator of the software, and there's the responsibility

46:29.600 --> 46:32.320
of the deliverer of the software.

46:32.320 --> 46:40.360
With Flat Hub and Snapcraft, Snap Store, I don't know if they have a name for this, but

46:40.360 --> 46:48.200
in those worlds, they're trying to essentially break this contract by saying the person who

46:48.200 --> 46:52.520
creates the code should be the one that delivers the code, in theory.

46:52.520 --> 46:57.320
But they also know that they don't have the pull to do it, and that this also creates

46:57.320 --> 47:03.440
a legal conundrum, because whenever you're delivering software that is not yours, you

47:03.440 --> 47:06.000
are actually taking on legal responsibility and liability.

47:06.000 --> 47:11.480
Again, not a lawyer, can't really, not legal advice, yada, yada, yada.

47:11.480 --> 47:17.480
But generally speaking, if you look at how all this stuff works, the moment you take

47:17.480 --> 47:22.560
a piece of code, whether it's compiled or not, and you do a transformation to deliver

47:22.560 --> 47:27.320
it, you're taking responsibility for that code at some level.

47:27.320 --> 47:32.920
And this is why a DMCA takedown by the signal people elicited the response that it did,

47:32.920 --> 47:37.580
because at the end of the day, whether Canonical likes to admit it or not, and they definitely

47:37.580 --> 47:42.520
don't like to admit to this, they are ultimately publishing every application, and at some

47:42.520 --> 47:46.540
level are legally responsible for every application delivered through the Snap Store.

47:46.540 --> 47:51.040
This is also true for Flathub, at some level they are responsible for every single thing

47:51.040 --> 47:52.520
that's on there.

47:52.520 --> 47:57.960
And if something is wrong, they are the ones in hot water just as much as everyone else,

47:57.960 --> 48:00.920
possibly more so because they're complicit.

48:00.920 --> 48:05.520
There's a whole lot of things that, like, Linux distributions have historically done

48:05.520 --> 48:10.280
quite a lot to avoid that these new age systems don't do.

48:10.280 --> 48:15.520
And because of that, we are going to see a lot more of these kinds of things happening

48:15.520 --> 48:22.600
as that exposure goes up and the proponents of these systems push it harder and harder.

48:22.600 --> 48:28.380
And the end result is going to be, with these new formats, probably what's going to eventually

48:28.380 --> 48:31.880
happen is essentially maintainer bankruptcy.

48:31.880 --> 48:36.160
If it is not delivered by the creator and it is not an open source solution, it is just

48:36.160 --> 48:43.880
going to disappear from all the stores, because the legal risk will go up over time, not down.

48:43.880 --> 48:49.360
Because this unwritten contract of, you don't sue me for making your software available,

48:49.360 --> 48:51.560
will be violated over and over and over.

48:51.560 --> 48:53.040
Oh, you should write this down, Neil.

48:53.040 --> 48:56.040
I feel like this would be a good spicy prediction for our predictions episode.

48:56.040 --> 48:57.040
Oh, yeah.

48:57.040 --> 48:58.040
It's going to keep happening.

48:58.040 --> 49:04.200
Like, Signal has a long and storied history of really not liking redistribution of their

49:04.200 --> 49:05.200
application.

49:05.200 --> 49:09.120
It doesn't matter what platform it is, if it is redistributed by someone else, they're

49:09.120 --> 49:10.600
going to go after you.

49:10.600 --> 49:12.160
Neil, it's just the lawyers.

49:12.160 --> 49:13.160
Neil, just blame the lawyers.

49:13.160 --> 49:18.280
So the lawyers are operating on a directive that exists at the top level that says, this

49:18.280 --> 49:19.680
is a thing we care about.

49:19.680 --> 49:20.680
And you know what?

49:20.680 --> 49:23.120
There's a lot of vendors that are the same way.

49:23.120 --> 49:24.480
Some of them hand wave it away.

49:24.480 --> 49:25.920
Standard practice at certain sizes.

49:25.920 --> 49:26.920
Yeah.

49:26.920 --> 49:28.240
So some vendors hand wave this away.

49:28.240 --> 49:33.400
I know, for example, that TeamViewer, even though their EULA actually forbids redistribution,

49:33.400 --> 49:38.960
they implicitly kind of hand wave it away for Linux people, because they're too small

49:38.960 --> 49:39.960
and nobody cares.

49:39.960 --> 49:40.960
Yada, yada, yada.

49:40.960 --> 49:41.960
Yes!

49:41.960 --> 49:44.240
Sneaking it in.

49:44.240 --> 49:49.440
If you actually read the end user license agreements of virtually every proprietary

49:49.440 --> 49:53.000
software package, you're not allowed to do this.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Yeah.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.880
And that is actually a thing we've all blatantly kind of ignored.

49:56.880 --> 49:58.680
Well that's not, you know, shh.

49:58.680 --> 49:59.680
Yeah.

49:59.680 --> 50:01.920
And so like, this is going to keep, this will keep biting us.

50:01.920 --> 50:06.240
Ironically, as Linux becomes more popular, it will start biting us more.

50:06.240 --> 50:11.560
And so, you know, places like, you know, the infamous third party repos that host non free

50:11.560 --> 50:15.960
software in the various Linux distributions, I'm not going to name names, but we all know

50:15.960 --> 50:20.880
what they are, and the flat hubs and the snap crafts and all these other things in the world,

50:20.880 --> 50:24.800
they're going to get bitten and burned over and over and over again.

50:24.800 --> 50:27.360
And we're going to see a bankruptcy of those things.

50:27.360 --> 50:28.400
Save it for the prediction show.

50:28.400 --> 50:29.400
That's spicy.

50:29.400 --> 50:30.400
I won't, I won't steal it.

50:30.400 --> 50:31.400
That's good.

50:31.400 --> 50:32.400
You own that one.

50:32.400 --> 50:36.400
I think if you guys will allow it, I think Colonel and I should be these guys just for

50:36.400 --> 50:41.160
a moment because not only do I hear the belly aching about Signal getting pulled out of

50:41.160 --> 50:45.600
the Snap store, but I also been hearing a lot of belly aching about them dropping SMS

50:45.600 --> 50:49.000
support and girl, just use Matrix already, right, Colonel?

50:49.000 --> 50:50.340
Just use Matrix.

50:50.340 --> 50:56.360
So one of the things I wanted to say on that is that Matrix is a decentralized program.

50:56.360 --> 50:59.060
You have multiple clients that are all compatible.

50:59.060 --> 51:02.640
You have a distributed network of servers.

51:02.640 --> 51:09.620
There is no one place that it can be taken down, whereas Signal is a centralized proprietary

51:09.620 --> 51:17.160
application with one set of servers, one app, and is, in my opinion, hostile to the open

51:17.160 --> 51:18.160
source community.

51:18.160 --> 51:24.000
Oh, and I would also say is sort of subjective to one large ego who sort of has a vision,

51:24.000 --> 51:25.960
is very particular about that vision.

51:25.960 --> 51:30.800
Moxie Marlin Spike has been very hostile to the open source community, not just Signal,

51:30.800 --> 51:33.400
but also other places as well.

51:33.400 --> 51:40.040
There was an application that in F-Droid that they took the Signal mobile code base, used

51:40.040 --> 51:47.360
the web hook for the desktop application just so that they could have an Android application

51:47.360 --> 51:51.820
that didn't rely on Google services framework.

51:51.820 --> 51:55.920
They went after them hard and basically shut them down.

51:55.920 --> 52:00.080
And that project was willing to work with Signal, was willing to, you know, what do

52:00.080 --> 52:02.220
we have to do to make this okay with you?

52:02.220 --> 52:08.000
And at the end of the day, Moxie, through GitHub comments and whatnot, it's still all

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
out there.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.280
You can go find it.

52:10.280 --> 52:16.560
He shut them down and said, no, this is basically, he said, it's my project, you'll do it my

52:16.560 --> 52:18.400
way, and I don't want you.

52:18.400 --> 52:19.400
That's the thing.

52:19.400 --> 52:25.480
And before we completely move off the matrix thing, I'll just say, not all matrix is element.

52:25.480 --> 52:30.300
Fluffy chat is very much a Telegram-like experience or Signal-like experience, because I'd say

52:30.300 --> 52:32.720
Signal is even simpler than Telegram.

52:32.720 --> 52:36.800
Fluffy chat is very clean, it's cross-platform, it's GPL3.

52:36.800 --> 52:42.300
And it takes the complexity of matrix and it puts it behind a UI simpler than Telegram.

52:42.300 --> 52:47.000
And if you're on iOS specifically, there's Neo, N-I-O, which has been built with Swift

52:47.000 --> 52:51.240
UI from scratch using all of the iOS design languages.

52:51.240 --> 52:56.040
This is MPL, it's also open source, and it gives a very clean, very minimal messaging

52:56.040 --> 52:57.040
experience.

52:57.040 --> 52:58.480
It's all matrix underneath it.

52:58.480 --> 53:02.040
And the reason why that's powerful is because you could be sitting back with a big old full

53:02.040 --> 53:06.480
scale element client, or you could be on Android with a totally different client, but you can

53:06.480 --> 53:08.000
still communicate.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.260
And they can't pull any one client and they can't pull any one server.

53:11.260 --> 53:16.320
And so it's not just element when we mean matrix, when we talk matrix, it can be these

53:16.320 --> 53:17.840
more purpose-built clients too.

53:17.840 --> 53:26.280
And if you go to matrix.org slash clients, you can see a surprisingly big list of different

53:26.280 --> 53:31.040
clients for different platforms from mobile to desktop to the web.

53:31.040 --> 53:34.240
So matrix.org slash clients for that.

53:34.240 --> 53:40.440
You know, had you presented matrix as an option to replace something like signal maybe a year

53:40.440 --> 53:45.440
ago, eight months ago, I would have said, no way, it's not even close to being usable.

53:45.440 --> 53:48.680
But these days I'm changing my mind on that.

53:48.680 --> 53:50.160
It's actually been really nice.

53:50.160 --> 53:52.280
So I think you guys are onto something here.

53:52.280 --> 53:56.760
Yeah, it's harder when you already have a whole social group on a particular service.

53:56.760 --> 53:58.480
You know, I get it.

53:58.480 --> 53:59.840
Sometimes people move quick though.

53:59.840 --> 54:03.040
Sometimes something comes up and people, they just jump ship.

54:03.040 --> 54:06.000
So when that moment, when that opportunity comes up, be ready.

54:06.000 --> 54:10.520
I also have two, let's call them notes because you guys are all friends here.

54:10.520 --> 54:14.200
As far as I understand the signal desktop is a GPL v3.

54:14.200 --> 54:16.280
So it is open source.

54:16.280 --> 54:20.480
And so the backend service, I don't believe is, maybe that's the distinction.

54:20.480 --> 54:25.540
And I'm pretty sure from what I've been reading that Moxie is not with signal anymore.

54:25.540 --> 54:27.000
So maybe that's a good thing.

54:27.000 --> 54:33.280
So Moxie is not with signal and yes, the client is a Faro GPL, but rebuilds that are not officially

54:33.280 --> 54:36.740
blessed by signal will not be allowed to connect to the signal server.

54:36.740 --> 54:40.520
So it doesn't matter.

54:40.520 --> 54:42.940
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

54:42.940 --> 54:44.640
Go try it for free as an individual.

54:44.640 --> 54:48.920
Or if you're a team, maybe you're in an enterprise, you can get a free trial when you go to bitwarden.com

54:48.920 --> 54:49.920
slash Linux.

54:49.920 --> 54:50.920
Straight up.

54:50.920 --> 54:51.920
I have to be honest with you.

54:51.920 --> 54:52.920
I have tried them all.

54:52.920 --> 54:57.720
And Bitwarden I have found to be the best and easiest way to store, share and sync your

54:57.720 --> 54:59.040
sensitive data.

54:59.040 --> 55:01.560
And I love that Bitwarden is open source.

55:01.560 --> 55:07.880
It's trusted by millions of individuals, teams, open source projects, organizations and more

55:07.880 --> 55:09.760
for all their secure passwords, storage.

55:09.760 --> 55:14.040
And when you do have to share that stuff, also Bitwarden helps you there too.

55:14.040 --> 55:17.480
In fact, it's really the only way you can feel safe kind of moving that sort of stuff

55:17.480 --> 55:18.960
around the internet between individuals.

55:18.960 --> 55:22.640
You don't want to write it down on a sticky note.

55:22.640 --> 55:24.080
Wes and I have been using it personally for years.

55:24.080 --> 55:26.960
I think Wes longer than I have.

55:26.960 --> 55:30.300
And Bitwarden has been rolling out great features like account switching in the mobile app or

55:30.300 --> 55:35.440
fast mail and DuckDuckGo integration so you can use a unique email address with every

55:35.440 --> 55:41.040
site or service or app that you're signing up with as well as a secure password, as well

55:41.040 --> 55:42.040
as a unique username.

55:42.040 --> 55:44.400
I mean, that's really, you can just layer on the security there.

55:44.400 --> 55:47.760
And I noticed Bitwarden just recently posted a great tutorial.

55:47.760 --> 55:50.960
So I always like to keep my eye on the stuff for you guys because, you know, why not leverage

55:50.960 --> 55:57.680
this and just get even more, I guess, secure because they have Bitwarden CLI, of course.

55:57.680 --> 55:58.880
Yeah, that's right.

55:58.880 --> 56:03.720
They have a command line version of Bitwarden and you can use this and pop in your passwords

56:03.720 --> 56:08.100
in your shell when you need to like log into something on the command line.

56:08.100 --> 56:12.360
You can leverage Bitwarden CLI and shell functions to create simple workflows that just allow

56:12.360 --> 56:17.320
you to unlock your secrets into environment variables whenever you need without requiring

56:17.320 --> 56:20.440
you to hard code your secrets into your dot files.

56:20.440 --> 56:21.440
How nice is that?

56:21.440 --> 56:23.560
Especially if you want to move them around between machines.

56:23.560 --> 56:28.800
So Bitwarden CLI could be a really great tool for your tool chest.

56:28.800 --> 56:29.800
Is that the phrase?

56:29.800 --> 56:32.300
I'll put a link to the guide in the show notes so you can check it out and see if it'll work

56:32.300 --> 56:33.300
for you.

56:33.300 --> 56:37.480
But go over to bitwarden.com slash Linux to support the show or send it to somebody you

56:37.480 --> 56:40.360
know that could use better password management.

56:40.360 --> 56:45.560
Maybe a friend, a family member, place of work, open source project, you know they're

56:45.560 --> 56:46.560
out there.

56:46.560 --> 56:49.360
Send them to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

56:49.360 --> 56:52.640
It'll be worth their time and you know it's the best way for them to stay secure online

56:52.640 --> 56:53.640
too.

56:53.640 --> 56:59.120
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

56:59.120 --> 57:02.920
All right Mr. Payne, so what would you like to share with the class this week?

57:02.920 --> 57:09.520
Yeah, I just wanted to send a little love to Godot, the cross-platform free and open

57:09.520 --> 57:11.000
source game engine.

57:11.000 --> 57:14.920
It's MIT, don't you know, launched in January 2014.

57:14.920 --> 57:19.480
And it's one of those really special projects I think because you know in the game making

57:19.480 --> 57:24.640
ecosystem there's just not that many great tools that I mean you might be able to get

57:24.640 --> 57:28.640
it for free or use it but that's you know some student or creator license or you know

57:28.640 --> 57:31.720
if you make any serious money they're going to want to cut or you're going to spend a

57:31.720 --> 57:34.360
whole bunch of money on all these assets through their system.

57:34.360 --> 57:36.360
They don't do any of that?

57:36.360 --> 57:37.360
No, no.

57:37.360 --> 57:42.880
They're trying to make a project that has a big set of common tools so you can just

57:42.880 --> 57:47.400
focus on making your game you don't have to like you know shell out and use a whole bunch

57:47.400 --> 57:51.360
of go find all the top leading industry applications that you're going to need to do your audio

57:51.360 --> 57:54.880
stuff and to go make your graphics and of course you can do that and import stuff if

57:54.880 --> 57:55.880
you want.

57:55.880 --> 57:59.000
But Godot's trying to make like a friendly you know you're learning about how to get

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
into games.

58:00.000 --> 58:04.760
I mean you can use it for serious games too but with a holistic approach that lets you

58:04.760 --> 58:06.840
really have everything you need under one roof.

58:06.840 --> 58:09.960
Looks like they just had a brand new beta release just a couple days ago too.

58:09.960 --> 58:14.360
Yeah 3.5 came out in August which was really nice and they're working on a 4.0 they're

58:14.360 --> 58:18.680
in the beta steps right now and that that's got some well that's got a lot of promising

58:18.680 --> 58:24.480
stuff and you know you can you can export native Linux games just you know right from

58:24.480 --> 58:27.760
Godot so they're platform friendly for us you can target Android you can target Web

58:27.760 --> 58:31.840
Assembly it runs on Linux as well as of course you know a bunch of other platforms you can

58:31.840 --> 58:36.000
compile it for BSD if you want to or run it on Windows or Mac.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Yeah there's even a web editor.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.800
If you want to go crazy there's a web editor.

58:40.800 --> 58:44.560
It's interesting you bring this up because okay so they just released a new beta a couple

58:44.560 --> 58:48.560
of days ago and then a couple of days before that they moved to a new foundation.

58:48.560 --> 58:49.560
They did yeah.

58:49.560 --> 58:53.000
Okay so as I mentioned they started way back in 2014 you know just a couple of people who

58:53.000 --> 58:59.840
were trying to pack together a game engine in 2015 they joined the SFC and SFC provided

58:59.840 --> 59:04.040
them you know a foundation structure a way to sort of take donations from projects because

59:04.040 --> 59:06.760
you know they'll sometimes get sponsorships from game studios or you know various other

59:06.760 --> 59:10.880
players in the industry and you need legal frameworks you need processes you need accountants

59:10.880 --> 59:15.300
who can help you like do those things and it's but it's been you know I think both parties

59:15.300 --> 59:19.480
have been really happy with it it's maybe a good example of what the SFC can do for

59:19.480 --> 59:22.920
open source projects is you know let them start to hire people part-time eventually

59:22.920 --> 59:28.680
start to hire people and support them full time to work on Godot but at this point you

59:28.680 --> 59:32.600
know Godot has really taken off it's grown a lot and so they're launching their own foundation

59:32.600 --> 59:38.380
now and they're they're pitching this as it's a it's a graduation from the SFC to launch

59:38.380 --> 59:43.480
their own foundation they're trying to take a lot off of how blender does it I think we've

59:43.480 --> 59:47.040
all been pretty pleased you know I don't know that they're perfect but as far as foundations

59:47.040 --> 59:50.800
go it seems like blenders got a good a good foundation in order so that gives me some

59:50.800 --> 59:55.720
hope that you know they are part of this is does seem to be that they want to mix up the

59:55.720 --> 59:59.600
different approaches that they can have you know maybe tailor some things to a thing that

59:59.600 --> 01:00:03.640
would make sense for Godot that didn't make sense for all the projects under the SFC umbrella

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:07.040
so they're thinking maybe they're going to have crowdfunding campaigns like like blender

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.660
or Krita do they're talking about maybe setting up something that lets users start to sell

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:15.440
assets for an asset library and integrate that in maybe sell merchandise or you know

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:19.400
just get a little more flexibility with sponsoring events or having events how might you fund

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:24.200
that or try to get fly people in to be there so there's a lot going on and it's just it's

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:28.680
really easy to get started with they've got a python like scripting language like Godot

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:33.040
script that's built in oh okay you can also use c-sharp if you already know c-sharp so

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.720
that's that's supported right out of the box I think you can even use c++ or rust or you

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:42.040
know there's some like community supported versions too yeah yeah you can use rust with

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:50.680
it okay that sounds like a really cool pic or it's not a pic but I guess it's a it's

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.200
a cool subject to bring to the class I guess but I'm curious why it's on your radar are

01:00:54.200 --> 01:01:00.680
you are you fooling around with making a game I've dabbled a little bit yeah well so it's

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:05.440
actually I've been trying to help my brother is very creative in this aspect and he you

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:08.820
know he's he's a big gamer he likes these things plays D&D and you know isn't just sort

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:13.960
of crafting all the different aspects of a game and so I've been trying to help him he's

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:18.300
learning some and that's been a fun adventure for me to sort of sit alongside and as he's

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:22.200
learning the technical side and I'm trying to support him there and fun this path of

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:27.880
Godot yeah he found it Godot Godot he actually found it first I'd heard of it you know I'd

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:31.600
followed it and looked at the looked at the news but it was so neat because you know he's

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:35.760
got I do I did give him a Linux laptop a couple years ago that he does use but he's using

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:39.320
it on his main sort of Windows gaming PC but it didn't matter like I could just load his

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:43.800
project in and make some updates like oh maybe try doing it this way and share it back with

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:48.120
him and he could load it up on Windows no problem so that's powerful yeah it's been

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:52.280
it's been a really nice fun and now I'm an expert I haven't made any fancy games yet

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:56.080
or anything but there's a lot of tutorials out there there's a strong community on on

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:59.800
YouTube of creators who are you know sharing you walking you through except got example

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.840
project files you can download so it seems super accessible before today I was aware

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:11.880
of it but I think in the back of my mind I thought it was like like using go for creating

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:16.240
games mm-hmm I didn't really would be a good name for it that's why I thought it was Godot

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:20.080
the Godot and I think in the past they were had a little more limited scope it seemed

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:24.360
like maybe it was better focused on like 2d games and stuff but these days they've got

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:28.680
you know rich 3d capabilities you can make VR applications if you want you can publish

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:32.600
to WebAssembly you can publish for all the mobile platforms like it seems like you know

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:36.440
if you're not a professional you're trying to just learn or explore you could go a long

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:39.280
way with Godot before it was gonna be your limitation you know what I like about their

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:43.680
website seeing a lot of tux the penguin mm-hmm and I'm seeing a lot of open source stuff

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:49.520
on here I'm seeing the open source logo seeing open source listed as one of their main features

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:54.800
great that is really slick well thanks for telling us about that mm-hmm so I wanted to

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.520
share with you guys a little thing a little trend that I've noticed and I know some of

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:01.800
our community members have because I've seen it getting discussed in our matrix kind of

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:08.260
recently and that is since Elon's announcement that he's taking over Twitter you know that

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:15.560
rough timeline we are seeing reports of just massive user gains for Mastodon 70,000 users

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:20.020
joining in the last couple of weeks is one of the numbers I've seen going around I know

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:24.320
I've heard it on some you know NPR type segments other news coverage people it doesn't get

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:33.140
a lot of play but its name is thrown out there CNN CNN headline from CNN updated yesterday

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:39.280
with Twitter in chaos Mastodon is on fire this is from your CNN news here and this is

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:43.240
the bit this is the bit that I noticed that I thought was pretty interesting they say

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:47.480
the service speaking about Mastodon the service has a similar look to Twitter with a timeline

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:52.700
of short updates sorted chronologically rather than algorithmically it lets users join a

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:58.480
slew of different servers run by various groups and individuals rather than one central platform

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:03.320
controlled by a single company like Twitter Instagram or Facebook now isn't that interesting

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:07.780
that that is one of the things they decided to kind of emphasize to the audience there

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:14.260
it's decentralized nature and I I don't think that you know Twitter's dead and Mastodon's

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:20.200
gonna take over anything like that but I find it interesting and I'm curious to know what

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:27.400
you think about these open source projects that build and build and build for years and

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:31.680
years and we know about them we hear about them and they kind of hover and they and they

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:35.920
have some users and we kind of keep them alive as the enthusiasts and we kind of use them

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:40.600
a little bit but then every now and then something breaks in the world and the normals hear about

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:44.280
one of these things has been around for years and they rush in and all of a sudden a project

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:49.080
just has tens of thousands of more users and there's tons more instances going along it's

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:53.880
a fascinating phenomena what do you attribute that to that it's like just wasn't good enough

01:04:53.880 --> 01:05:00.000
to replace the main thing until well you know you've got that you've got the network effect

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.120
you know what do you need it what do you need a harder to figure it out harder to set up

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:07.220
you got to make some choices to pick your instance sort of system if you you know you're

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:14.600
already on the functionally the one instance everyone cares about I wondered is uh is the

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:19.200
poll hitting do you guys feel like it's time to join the mastodon or get on get on a mastodon

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.640
if you're not I am curious again you know I've never I don't know that I've ever actually

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:27.760
set it up I have you know followed it for a while but yeah what about you Brent Lee

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:32.320
are you getting the mastodon urge at all well the first time I got curious was when I was

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:36.560
in Alan Jude's basement doing a brunch with him and he said hey are you a Fediverse guy

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:43.320
and uh so I looked into it a little bit um but these days I feel like it's almost irresponsible

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:49.660
not to at least check it out a little bit I was just not interested in any more social

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:56.280
media like telegram twitter matrix several others that I can't think of off the top of

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:59.400
my head those are sufficient for me I didn't really want to add another one so I just sort

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:06.480
of said no then when the podcasting 2.0 stuff came along and they had a mastodon to just

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:10.720
talk about podcasting 2.0 it all of a sudden made a ton of sense because it was like a

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:16.880
niche category they're talking about app development namespace development they're you know hashing

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:21.120
out what the new standards should be for things and it's like people discussing podcasting

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:25.920
you know something like okay I'll join that that makes a ton of sense so I do have a mastodon

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:30.340
account but it's on a very specific instance and you're not really using the sort of federation

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:36.120
aspect no am I missing something because I love the matrix federated aspect but matrix

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:40.520
seems to really fill this this hole for me but I wonder if it is the time to have like

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:45.500
is it is it time to have a JB mastodon or should I just be joining somebody else's mastodon

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:50.160
what is the protocol there are mastodon servers a pain in the butt to run I know you looked

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:53.880
a little bit into setting it up didn't seem that hard I mean there's some you know official

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:58.120
containers out there and such this is exactly the conversation we had around matrix and

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:04.000
what is the size of that box running these days okay fair we did it's on like a 48 core

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.460
rig now yeah we also made some mistakes that maybe we've learned from yeah we have to find

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:15.840
out you kind of want to set one up don't you what is wrong with you what is wrong with

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:20.320
you I mean I kind of be down I suppose what's the point of having a system you can run yourself

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:24.600
if you don't at least try but then what happens if I already have an account I have an account

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:28.840
on mastodon I believe there's a way to migrate I don't know I don't know how easy that is

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:32.440
and then also I know like the peer tube instance is a sense is also part of that federation

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:37.840
it's very confusing to me if you've created an a mastodon presence on one home server

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:44.560
and decide you want to migrate to another there's in in pretty much every mastodon I

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:50.280
should say every activity pub Twitter clone like implementation so that's basically what

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:58.600
this is yeah in their account UI you can transfer your your account to another to another account

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:03.200
that you have created and it'll basically create a forwarding address and so all of

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:08.640
your followers will move in theory all of your followings will move it'll create a continuity

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:14.560
between your posts all that other fun stuff so picking one is not a forever choice if

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:18.640
you don't like your home server at some point in the future you can jump ship if your home

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:21.880
server is now broken and you want it and you need to move somewhere else you can do that

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:27.600
too so would it be weird see I think what we probably should have done with matrix is

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:32.640
we should have set up matrix and just left it to the JB people and then everybody else

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.120
uses matrix.org to create their account and join our server that was one of the mistakes

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:40.200
I was thinking about earlier that's what the tux digital folks did with their system was

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:44.840
they didn't they only allowed people to create accounts on the tux digital server when they

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:52.120
were creators of the network so I wonder is the solution with mastodon to do the same

01:08:52.120 --> 01:09:01.580
it's more scalable that way because like matrix mastodons underlying system works off of synchronizing

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:07.360
events via a pub sub mechanism activity pub and matrix behave very similarly even though

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:12.260
they're different standards and so you have the same kind of resource constraints and

01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:17.720
performance constraints so yeah you probably want to create a lockdown mastodon server

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:22.520
that only y'all are using and then everyone else just kind of connects with you through

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:26.720
their own I mean part of the whole federated benefits right I mean just have our own and

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.280
then connect out to all our friends but the important part is to make sure that your your

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:35.880
server is discoverable right like if it's not then all of that doesn't matter what I

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:39.760
like about it is it's sort of like it's our own form of verification because we'd have

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:44.320
an at Jupiter broadcasting.com domain it's like you'd know it really is us and you know

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.200
we don't have to have any blue checkmark that's eight bucks a month it's just we have our

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:54.000
own domain name I like it I think one question I would have is what can it provide that our

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:00.120
matrix instance and use of it for the last six plus months wouldn't provide well I suppose

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:05.880
there's people that are on the mastodon fediverse that aren't in matrix you could follow them

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:11.080
there is an argument for matrix to be used for real-time discussion and something else

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:16.440
to be used for more longer term stuff that people can post and come back to at all different

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:21.460
hours and review in a feed on their own schedule right I mean because one I mean I suppose

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:24.840
like that the Twitter style things are used for different purposes by different groups

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:29.640
and all that but one of them is a sort of like broadcasty or musing or you know whatever

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:33.600
jokes things that you wouldn't really put necessarily in like a public channel unless

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:38.240
you were very social about it the more we talk about it the less I want to do it I really

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:44.080
do it's just I hate social media so much but then I remember like except for this is selecting

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:47.840
for very high quality signal like the open source community the free software community

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.320
and in particular the JB audience which this would skew towards is higher than average

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:56.240
signal so then it does make it more worth it again and so here's the thing to think

01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:02.920
about right so activity pub the underlying protocol that what we call mastodon where

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:09.480
some would use called pluroma or some of these other ones right that underlying protocol

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:15.520
is not just used for Twitterati style messaging it's also used for things like blogging so

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:24.240
I believe what's it right freely is an activity pub based blog platform and there are a few

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:31.080
others out there and basically one thing you can do is to combine long form and short form

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:38.080
in such a way that somewhat you would post on on a system attached through activity pub

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:43.000
and someone could comment on it through this and then you wind up having this federated

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:51.240
mechanism of connecting these two so having and and again this same address can exist

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:56.900
in different solutions at the same time because again the activity pub publishing address

01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:02.920
is what matters here so for example Chris last at Jupiter at Chris last at Jupiter broadcasting

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:07.560
.com I really hate the scheme that they picked correctly yeah it's really done but all right

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:13.780
put that aside that address could be both a blogging platform where you are writing

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:18.840
about or blogging or whatever because peer tube is also activity pub oriented right and

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:23.740
all these things connect and as you're using a singular identity to publish as everyone

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:28.400
else can see them and they can reply to them which turn into comments and visible feeds

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:34.760
and things of that nature and then you wind up having this interconnected relationship

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:38.960
and this goes for like pixel fed as well right the the federated image hosting thing that

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:42.800
also operates on activity pub and I've noticed that a little bit I've already noticed some

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:47.720
activity pub cross publishing with peer tube and that is pretty powerful activity pub is

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:52.040
designed for multiple forms of transmission from a single identity whereas the matrix

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:59.440
protocol is designed for real-time communication or at least a facsimile of it across across

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:03.680
a single identity across different servers and things like that with a single identity

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:08.440
so the idea is with activity pub you take these disparate services and you connect them

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:14.360
to a unified identity and different types of content are published with that identity

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:19.540
and everything weaves together and clients that respect these different types of events

01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:25.600
process them correctly so if you're looking at a federated blog viewer or if you're looking

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:34.600
at a Twitterati style client or if you're looking at you know a photo gallery Pinterest

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.800
style thing or whatever right the idea of activity pub is that you have a coherent singular

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:44.600
identity that can have all these multiple forms of content and then the clients will

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:49.800
interpret that and do what you will with it whereas with matrix you're just talking about

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:53.280
you know you have a dedicated purpose these features are being built around a particular

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:59.160
single method of communication and you're supporting that mechanism with its clients

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.160
and servers so that's where the core difference is like yeah that's a good distinction to

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:08.040
make you're not going to see matrix do like image galleries I mean technically I suppose

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:12.400
you could do that but like nobody's like going out there and doing that whereas activity

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:16.040
pub that's a very real thing you would do all right so let me know everyone out there

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:21.560
what your thoughts are on if you're feeling the pull towards Mastodon I would go if there's

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:25.440
enough audience there I think it'd be something I consider like to hear your thoughts on it

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:34.240
MJVC wrote in just wanted to report that I've been successfully using NixOS on the Steam

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:39.440
Deck as a desktop replacement dual booting SteamOS and NixOS gives me the best of both

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:43.900
worlds there are a few hiccups with the touch screen but aside from that it works pretty

01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:50.560
flawlessly that is really cool on the Steam Deck oh man I replied very quickly saying

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:55.000
tell us how we want to do this so we might have an update coming soon and I wonder is

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.600
it plasma or are you using GNOME tell me tell me tell me good question I think this is more

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:04.200
of a teaser than a you know full description so I'm gonna wait for the update and we'll

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:10.520
come back on that five also wrote in about NixOS surprise surprise I have an idea you

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:17.200
keep saying Chris that you don't want to pollute Linux unplugged with too much NixOS well we

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:22.680
did it again this week didn't we well I agree I think NixOS is so vast that maybe you can

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:30.880
start NixOS unplugged that's what we need we need another show just what you asked for

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:36.280
what we'll do is we'll just geek out and then we'll just surface the best of we'll condense

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:40.920
it down and just really bring you the nuggets from time to time right is that what our that

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:47.820
you like that plan is that so I think so all right let's go with that and now it is time

01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:53.560
for the boost so the first boost we're gonna get to this week is actually follow up on

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:58.160
a boost that was sent in from Neve a couple of weeks ago who offered to send us an arc

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:04.640
GPU from Intel incredibly generous so we wrote back and said no but we'll borrow it for a

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:13.600
little bit and guess what it's right it's here we have it right here it showed up the

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:20.760
ASRock Challenger ITX Intel arc a380 I'm gonna open her up here there's there's actually

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:25.600
a pie in the box I actually have not opened it so if there is or a bomb we're gonna stream

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:31.320
it live we will find out I would be not what I want but not like totally disappointing

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.340
I think that might be our version of a rickroll at this point I don't know there's a there's

01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:38.640
an envelope in here you know I feel like we should do the Johnny Carson thing so we'll

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:44.160
read the tracks oh here it is this week died doing what we love now if you're the best

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:49.920
aka Josh the best look at this look at this beautiful card oh there's a there's a thumb

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:56.240
drive in here okay what you know better than to put it strange thumb trap there's a thumb

01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:01.920
drive I wouldn't that be fun tempting well maybe we'll find out in the members feed we'll

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.960
figure out what's in the thumb drive but yeah this check it out Wes that's a compact little

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:13.040
card the a380 is doesn't look bad though and I imagine our or I think our Thalia order

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:17.160
is gonna go in Monday morning I've been dragging I've been so busy I haven't got around to

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:21.360
it that's how you was you want to savor that click you know when you actually hit the order

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:26.080
to you I mean the right state of mind glass of champagne in hand I I've come I think with

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:30.280
a really reasonable build I think it's a very reasonable build of the Thalia and I'll share

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:36.960
it when we get it but that's going in there okay take it out let's pull it out let's pull

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:43.560
it out oh yeah yeah that is beautiful Intel thank you thank you for making this Intel

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:47.680
finally look at the fan on that thing hold that up a little bit there West so we can

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:51.920
look at it yeah look at that thing it's got a almost like a hundred almost probably not

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:56.600
quite as big as a hundred and twenty millimeter fan on the top of it yeah but one big fan

01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:00.680
so hopefully me there we go yeah it really moves good job Wes you got it you gotta do

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:05.440
a fan test that's gotta do a fan test leader of the mind Wes blows across the fan to prove

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:10.140
to the listener it's really there we got one HDMI three display ports here nice little

01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:14.880
plugs it ships with I mean it's not quite that it's almost half the length of a new

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:21.360
Nvidia card it's not quite but it is stout it's wide and stout it's nice so we'll throw

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:25.600
that in the new Thalia and through throw it through its paces and hopefully we'll see

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:31.100
hopefully get OBS going with that is it up to the challenge will it meet our needs it's

01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:37.280
not ready yet OBS I think just is I saw the pull request go in to turn on quicksync video

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:45.120
stuff for for free codecs and support for the new generation of the Intel arc stuff

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:50.080
like like the last week so I don't I don't think that that's a thing for a little while

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:55.920
building OBS from source again we're back here yep also just a couple days ago Michael

01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:01.960
Arbrol reported that you need an Intel ME enabled system to update the GSC firmware

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:07.680
on the arc right now so that means a it's got to be an Intel system to even update the

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:11.560
firmware and be you need Intel ME enabled which I don't know what that means for the

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:18.280
Thalia but since we're only borrowing it it's not the end of the world for us but it's something

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:24.840
weird clearly clearly a new product but that's okay yeah on system 76 machines the management

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:30.840
engine is turned off so that's gonna be a problem yeah well I mean like I said if I

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:35.800
was gonna if I was buying this forever's yes but since we just want to test it and we're

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:39.600
willing to do a little bit of the grunt work to make that work I don't actually know if

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:43.800
the system 76 things give you the ability to turn it on you should tell us when you

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:47.840
get the paleo whether they give you an option to turn it back on yeah well I'll also try

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:51.760
a firmware update if there is one just to see what happens hopefully I don't think it

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:58.880
would break it right all right now Chris do you know how long you have this for is there

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:04.080
like a loaner expiry date have you come to some agreement there um so basically in and

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:09.040
you know until I were done I guess you didn't really say I don't intend to keep it too long

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:12.840
you know a few years you know no big deal you know just just a few years it sounds great

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:18.360
okay update I guess Intel reached out to say that firmware updating will work on AMD platforms

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:21.800
I just don't think all the details of like what weird app you have to run or how exactly

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:27.880
that will work okay so it will work well the good news it's only 120 ish dollars so you

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:33.120
know if Chris breaks it he can afford to pay the guy back we'll take it out of Brent sets

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:40.960
all right night 62 boosted in with 40 96 sats this is my first boost I use the blue wallet

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:45.160
I'll be combination so blue wallet to get the sats and then I'll be as the lightning

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:49.800
wallet the idea of setting up my own lightning node seems very appealing but I found that

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:53.960
the setup is actually working really easy I loving that I can just give some value this

01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:59.060
way now here's a question about Nix OS versus ansible on other distros can you go deeper

01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:03.740
into what makes Nix so much better in your opinion couldn't a well-documented ansible

01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:08.820
setup do most of the same things I'd also love to hear more about the next package manager

01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:13.200
on other distros does this replace ansible it's a great question because we get this

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.720
one a lot and I don't think the position of the show is one is better than the other to

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:23.640
make that clear and ansible is obviously gonna support a lot wider range a combination of

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:30.160
devices services hardware distributions software in general and we use ansible here so it's

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:36.040
not like we're anti ansible I think what I explained earlier today with the setup I was

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:41.680
doing where I you know just took a config file off my laptop and dropped it on my Odroid

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:47.800
very different systems very different hardware and I just rebuilt and I had a fully functional

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:52.640
system without having all of the overhead of also having ansible and having to understand

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:58.280
how to write a playbook and manage all of that it's just basically some yaml and you

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:03.680
can almost always find an example and it's there's a simplicity if you're only using

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:07.920
Nix it doesn't really work so great outside of that you could use the Nix package manager

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:12.560
just about anything but yeah I like I use it on my work Mac love it yeah they're super

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:16.880
super helpful yeah I think it's better than brew in most cases so I think the other part

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:20.760
too is you're right like ansible super flexible you can you know use it all kinds of different

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:24.240
places it's trying to solve problems that Nix is not primarily targeted at there's a

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:28.760
lot of differences because ansible is a big tool and Nix also is a big tool then especially

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:33.640
between Nix and Nix OS but the other part is I think for you at least from what we've

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:37.960
talked about kind of wanted to get away from those other distros right like okay if I if

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:41.040
I use ansible I might not have to think about as much because I wrote that playbook in itself

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:44.960
but like you're still using apt under the hood or things like that like Nix is a much

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:50.560
more holistic for the things it works for you've got this package and system that all

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:55.840
feels tightly together and lean and mean and not just sort of bolted on top to try to pack

01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:00.800
paper over some of the limitations of the base system yeah I think you nailed it and

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:07.620
you and I both just trend towards a preference for very simple servers minimum viable server

01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:13.040
nothing more than it needs to be and and then because you and I apparently are masochists

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:18.120
when we can we also make them rolling because if you keep it simple and you appropriately

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:22.360
separate applications and data and you've got good backups and snapshots I actually

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:27.080
think the best experience in Linux is a very modern system I wouldn't say cutting edge

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:31.980
because there's some stuff in Nix it isn't super cutting edge but and that that all has

01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:36.840
worked really well without having all of the ansible overhead so yes you put it very well

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:45.480
well our next boost comes from Caspeeland with 3690 sats b-o-o-s-t just a simple message

01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:50.040
but this time I hope the boost in streaming sets will help you podcasters good to see

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:55.840
you again costs mm-hmm thank you very much ah another favorite of ours wait all boosters

01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:08.380
are our favorites but it's rusta casta versa boosted in with 1000 sets and calling out

01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:13.820
something that I think we all noticed and appreciated big mumble room energy on the

01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:19.680
intro last week yeah so hey thanks mumble room it was really painful not to be here

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:25.040
last week and having that strong intro knowing that you were here to support Chris that that

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:29.280
helped a lot I was yeah also a big shout out to Neil in there specifically in the whole

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:32.800
mumble room was just great I think they had my back you know because you guys are both

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:36.940
out Brent on his secret mission to moose hunt and you with the sick and so to have them

01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:40.960
just there with my back was great but the funny thing was is literally everybody internally

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:46.800
on our internal chat like that was the first comment that mumble intro energy yeah totally

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:52.640
killed it it was great so thank you very much I will say we also did get some feedback specifically

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:57.960
saying that Neil was very much enjoyed last episode so thanks Neil for for filling in

01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:05.920
for us well I don't know how to take that I guess thanks I don't know I don't know how

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:14.560
to answer that he's blushing tater boosts in with 2050 sets tater says coming in hot

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:19.240
with the boost we love that one that's my favorite I feel like tater took my advice

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:24.760
I said you don't have to write us something profound to kick off a huge discussion just

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:29.120
send us the boost for support because we love those thank you very much tater well nor

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:35.580
Kyle geek wrote something profound hello nor cocky with 8080 sets you're doing a good job

01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:40.180
hey I know I'm a few weeks behind but I wanted to put in my two cents on the butter fs discussion

01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:44.200
I mean we're always talking about butter fs so I think you're right on time I'm currently

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:50.420
using open Sousa micro OS desktop as my daily driver micro s is an immutable OS which uses

01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:56.020
butter fs snapshots instead of OS tree like silver blue does for me it's been a rock solid

01:25:56.020 --> 01:26:02.380
the updates apply every time and I haven't had to break or roll back yet that's a W for

01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:08.340
butter fs to me I agree and I think open Sousa too and one of the things that they point

01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:12.220
out here is they're using it as the desktop daily driver and to have that kind of rock

01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:18.780
solid performance that is a win that is super nice we spent a period of time between distros

01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:22.740
we spent some time with open Sousa and I played with the immutable version for a little bit

01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:26.620
on a cm4 and we set up a jellyfin server on it and we all kind of added a bunch of different

01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:35.020
stuff to it and I was really impressed I really was again there's a lot of OS there and we're

01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:40.740
more of a minimum viable OS type guys but it's a great OS it is that yeah I think it

01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:45.420
could be you know it seemed very administratable you know designed with that kind of in mind

01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:50.620
which can appreciate when things when things go wrong user 720 also wrote in with a hundred

01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:58.780
cents gif gif let's hold a boost ballot here's a hundred sats on gif wow then gif is winning

01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:06.060
right now we'll find out next yeah that's it right there right I guess okay who are

01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:11.140
we to stand in the way pull over yeah so far gifts the winner maybe it only takes a hundred

01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:21.420
sets maybe it's settled maybe it's not JPC also boosted in with 22,222 sets love the

01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:27.540
show by the way I'm using boost CLI just like that awesome it's the new by the way I use

01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:32.700
arch right they kind of well it is more technical than setting up arch yeah maybe you want to

01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:38.700
set it up by about a mile I am so impressed JPC thank you also for the for the generous

01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:45.460
but yeah but also boost CLI is a serious badge of honor you have mastered multiple layers

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:51.740
of the stack and you are very impressive thank you for the boost I I haven't even got that

01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:55.460
working yet and I've been playing around with Bitcoin for 13 years and I haven't even gotten

01:27:55.460 --> 01:28:00.660
that working yet so give me a break all right maybe maybe 11 years anonymous boosted in

01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:07.060
with a thousand sats just to say regarding caring about if the art is generated from

01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:12.260
AI when I'm looking at it I'm looking at it not because of the artist I'm looking at it

01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:15.500
because it's beautiful much like diamonds even when they're created in the lab they're

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:19.180
still beautiful they're still art you know we got a couple of people that actually wrote

01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:23.060
it and said they would listen to AI generated versions of the show well how do they know

01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:26.340
they're not listening right now to that how do they know we need to generate some more

01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:31.140
stills how do we do this oh yeah we do need to yeah I'm running out of project I'm running

01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:35.020
out of stills but I do we have the GPU power anywhere or do we spin up another one I don't

01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:39.980
know you tell me I do not know we also got a bunch of boosts that either had no message

01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:44.000
or they were streaming sats so we don't cover all of them so that way we can keep this tight

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:50.260
enough but I do just want to do a couple of shout outs 250 sats from tepulus 500 sats

01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:56.100
from code Michael and 100 sats from now science news thank you to them thank you to everyone

01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:59.180
who boosted and even if you didn't make it on the show and of course to all the ones

01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:03.900
who do make it on the show if you'd like to participate in the grand experiment you can

01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:07.780
get a new podcast app at new podcast apps calm we're building a network of people that

01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:11.480
are armed with sats and we're starting to see a couple of open source projects come

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:15.660
on but we're also seeing a lot of podcasters come online and I think this is a critical

01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:19.780
moment in podcasting I think we are witnessing West what was the one you were listening to

01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:24.380
recently where they had just these horrible dynamic inserted ads yeah I think it was the

01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:28.720
Conan O'Brien podcast yep and it was like it was one of those gambling you know platform

01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:33.860
sports betting kind of things and then after the ad it was this supercut and slightly tight

01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:39.900
and and sped up sped up yeah like 1.25x speed without me doing the ad but just of the ad

01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:43.420
and them doing all the disclaimers state by state for the different hotlines if you have

01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:48.740
a gambling problem which that's good people should get help but like it was a solid 30

01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:52.020
seconds and I was like I just was trying to listen to the podcast I don't mind a little

01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:55.140
ad because most of his ads are kind of like you're you know like yeah they're funny and

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:59.700
they're like organic this was just garbage well you know what they do is so when when

01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:03.660
revenue dips and this is going to be happening more and more is you just turn to the dynamic

01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:08.820
ads it's kind of like monetizing on YouTube and I just not the direction to go and there

01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:13.100
is it's there somehow they made them worse than radio ads which is what's remarkable

01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:17.660
is like you would never thought it was going to happen in podcasting and I hate to see

01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:21.940
this happening and I feel like we're building an alternative with podcasting 2.0 and the

01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:26.260
value for value stuff so I'm hoping that this is an idea that spreads and if you'd like

01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:30.540
to participate new podcast apps calm if you're in the States and you want to grab some stats

01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:35.780
really easy the cash app and the strike app make that super easy to do the cash app just

01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:39.980
recently added lightning support so there's a major vendor on lightning now hey yo and

01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:45.500
then if you're outside the states blue wallets and robosats and others are great ways to

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:50.220
go now we're running kind of long so we're going to skip the pics this week so why don't

01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:54.880
we mention that we will be live next week we are doing our fedora 37 review we'd love

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:59.120
to have you join us for that that's at Jupiter dot tube we usually kick off the stream a

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:04.420
little bit before noon pacific 3 p.m. eastern over there so get your browser fired up or

01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:10.300
your VLC client or your MPV head over to Jupiter dot tube and help us peer out the stream see

01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:16.460
you next week same bad time same bad station we need like a phrase for that like when you're

01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:20.340
when you're helping seed the stream is that it because it's all peer-to-peer it is all

01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:24.960
peer-to-peer and so it lets us run our own YouTube basically right we're not paying our

01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:30.940
big CDN bills up and it's part of the federation it's a powerful set of tooling I love it self-hosted

01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:36.820
value for value self-hosted live streaming self-hosted live interaction you know like

01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:42.340
just love it self-hosted Twitter self-hosted and masks on you know I don't know maybe let

01:31:42.340 --> 01:31:45.500
us know what you think thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of the unplug

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:50.820
program links to what we talked about today at Linux unplug comm slash what 484 384 you'll

01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:55.340
figure it out figure it out see you next week

01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:30.900
I have a question and I am very afraid of what the answer is gonna be but I think I

01:32:30.900 --> 01:32:37.100
know what it's gonna be I think my car has a blown head gasket not my not my car but

01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:43.400
my wife's car has a blown head gasket oh typically if you think that it does it probably does

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:48.700
here's the symptoms I'm seeing we're using we've we not always but we've had to refill

01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:53.300
the coolant a couple of times but there's no dripping oh and the catalytic converter

01:32:53.300 --> 01:33:01.500
is clogged up oh oh god I did a ob2 port scan and I noticed that bank one is running rich

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:06.020
and it's adding fuel especially at low idles it's adding like 16% fuel and then on the

01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:13.060
freeway doing like 2% and I'm thinking like okay so coolants gone not rapid coolant but

01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:18.500
a little bit of coolant thinking running rich thinking clogged cat does it report like

01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:22.860
compression on each cylinder as well do you have that kind of detail you know I didn't

01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:27.140
see that look for it I think that's a good that would be a key indicator huh I think

01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:31.100
I'm gonna bring it in and find out I like our impromptu car talk segment here yeah little

01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:37.420
car talk little Linux core talk before cars are computers pop up a pop Prince garage well

01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:42.220
cars are computers yeah they were especially this one let me tell you Chris did you try

01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:48.460
a last-minute upgrade see if that fixes it right
