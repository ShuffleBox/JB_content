WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.640
People don't talk about this, but birds fight all the time.

00:03.840 --> 00:07.400
And if you think about how absurd that is, like humans, at least when we fight,

00:07.400 --> 00:10.200
we're fighting over territory and resources on this rock.

00:10.440 --> 00:14.960
But the birds have the whole frickin sky and they they land on my roof

00:15.200 --> 00:16.800
and they fight on my roof.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.560
They have like battles on my roof and I can hear them charging each other.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.200
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, boom.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.360
And then they collide.

00:22.360 --> 00:24.320
And then it's smack, smack, smack, smack, smack all over the place.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.800
And they take off and they come back and then it's tap, tap, tap, tap.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.960
And they collide and they ram each other on my roof.

00:30.520 --> 00:35.120
I think that it won't be a problem if we just get a live stream of the roof action.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.680
And I can sort of the IRC room that goes out to the tubes.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.760
We'll make it a patron exclusive.

00:40.760 --> 00:41.760
Put that behind the paywall.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.760
And then we'll have to be disappointed when that becomes more popular

00:45.760 --> 00:48.680
than this show itself. Yeah, that's true.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.040
Yeah, crows fight a lot.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.760
I know. I know. It's weird.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.960
It's it's really strange because it's it's like,

00:54.960 --> 00:59.440
um, I think like they don't care at all that I'm down here yelling at them.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.480
Plus, then that also means I'm down here yelling at them like a lunatic.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.800
Right. You look crazy.

01:05.200 --> 01:10.040
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 250 for May 22nd, 2018.

01:21.040 --> 01:24.280
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

01:24.280 --> 01:27.560
that's definitely gotten bitten by the new laptop bug.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.640
My name is Chris. My name is Wes.

01:29.640 --> 01:30.720
Hello, Wes.

01:30.720 --> 01:35.600
This week, we're going to talk about something that's been on our minds for weeks.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.800
The perfect Linux laptop for 2018.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.280
We've got a few suggestions.

01:40.280 --> 01:43.600
We'll take your suggestions and we'll start a little elimination

01:43.600 --> 01:47.400
and decide which one might be the best, at least for a lot of our needs.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.840
Plus, I've really cracked notes on Linux now.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.320
I mentioned this recently, but I'll go over my final setup,

01:52.320 --> 01:58.200
how I'm using Nextcloud 13 QO notes, cloud notes for the iPhone

01:59.000 --> 02:04.960
and notes for Nextcloud to get markdown compliant synchronized notes

02:04.960 --> 02:09.840
across my desktops, my laptops, my phones and the web.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.440
That's the holy grail.

02:11.440 --> 02:16.160
It is. Plus, we've got some great app picks, some really useful tools,

02:16.800 --> 02:20.760
some great community news like Gnome's performance hack fest,

02:20.760 --> 02:26.160
building cute apps with Rust and some robots that are picking up balls

02:26.520 --> 02:29.080
and Tesla's GPL compliance battle,

02:29.720 --> 02:33.920
as well as why Mycroft might be integrating blockchain into future devices.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.600
Yeah, I said that. Mycroft integrating blockchain.

02:36.640 --> 02:38.440
The Mycroft coin could be nigh.

02:38.600 --> 02:41.840
So we have so many things to talk about on today's episode.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.080
So we can't go any further without bringing in the Mumble Room.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.640
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:45.640 --> 02:46.360
Good evening.

02:46.360 --> 02:47.360
Hello.

02:47.720 --> 02:50.360
All right, guys, we have some serious stuff

02:50.360 --> 02:54.440
to get into, so I thought maybe before we got all really serious,

02:54.800 --> 02:58.440
we could start with something light, an automated ball boy.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.920
It's a robot powered by Ubuntu.

03:00.920 --> 03:04.000
And you guessed it, it's a Kickstarter right now.

03:04.640 --> 03:08.200
Players and coaches everywhere know the frustration and tediousness

03:08.200 --> 03:11.040
that goes into collecting balls during the practice session.

03:11.960 --> 03:14.200
And this is why we invented Tenabot.

03:15.240 --> 03:18.240
Tenabot is the world's first robotic ball collector.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.200
Tenabot perfectly integrates computer vision and artificial intelligence

03:22.200 --> 03:25.560
to detect tennis balls on the court and collect them for players.

03:27.280 --> 03:30.160
You can let Tenabot work autonomously using the station

03:30.160 --> 03:32.160
that easily attaches to the net post,

03:32.160 --> 03:35.760
or use Tenabot's app to customize where in the court the device will clear.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.920
Tenabot easily syncs to your phone and even your Apple Watch

03:39.920 --> 03:42.400
to make activation quick and seamless.

03:42.880 --> 03:46.640
The app also keeps track of how many balls are collected during a session

03:46.640 --> 03:48.640
and how often you practice.

03:48.640 --> 03:52.320
So feel free to brag to your friends about how you're stepping up your game

03:52.320 --> 03:54.640
while never having to pick up another tennis ball.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.320
Of course. That's right.

03:56.320 --> 04:00.960
This Ubuntu powered autonomous ball boy is launching here in the US.

04:00.960 --> 04:04.400
And they started as a Raspberry Pi product, then moved it on to an Arduino

04:04.400 --> 04:07.200
and then eventually their own custom SBC.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.760
And they say that Ubuntu was a natural choice

04:09.760 --> 04:12.400
because it was easy to get working with the team,

04:12.400 --> 04:14.240
it provided the stability that needed,

04:14.240 --> 04:17.680
and there was plenty of support, and they crammed it into this robot

04:17.680 --> 04:20.640
that's got all kinds of crazy cameras and sensors.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.680
And Wes, I don't know if you knew this, because I'm not a sports guy.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.000
Don't believe in it. Don't believe it.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.920
Don't believe in sports.

04:27.920 --> 04:32.960
But I'm told by these people that do that they spend sometimes more time

04:32.960 --> 04:34.720
picking up balls than they do hitting balls.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.000
Yeah, right. I mean, everyone hates it.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.360
You want to play the fun part of the game.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.160
You don't want to do all the rest of the maintenance work.

04:40.160 --> 04:42.160
This thing's got an 80 ball capacity.

04:42.160 --> 04:46.080
So I don't know how much time you play, but that's more than enough for me.

04:46.080 --> 04:49.680
Yeah, that's probably going to do me for my whole life, I tell you.

04:50.560 --> 04:54.560
So this thing comes with a companion app that tracks like how many games you play

04:54.560 --> 04:59.040
and lets you like section it off to a certain area of the court,

04:59.040 --> 05:00.720
which is kind of neat.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.600
And it is up on Kickstarter if you want to get in on it, right?

05:03.600 --> 05:05.200
So you can get it for like 600 bucks right now.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.040
Eventually it's going to be like a thousand.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.000
They've already smashed their goal.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.680
They had $35,000 goal.

05:09.680 --> 05:15.920
They've raised $68,243 with 96 backers and they still got 16 days left to go.

05:15.920 --> 05:18.080
Tenobot, we're on Ubuntu.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.080
I mean, I wouldn't buy it for me.

05:20.080 --> 05:25.040
But if you were like a private tennis club, it kind of seemed, you know, $650,000.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.240
That's not that much for a nice piece of equipment if it lasted you a couple of years.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.720
And it looks really handy and it's so cute.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.720
I was asking Popi before the show, I said,

05:32.720 --> 05:36.960
so did you hear anything in the halls of canonical about this robot?

05:36.960 --> 05:40.880
And he said, no, but you did have a good idea for what you could use a robot like this for.

05:40.880 --> 05:41.680
What was that, Popi?

05:41.680 --> 05:42.080
Right.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.360
Well, you know, the whole thing about Ubuntu Core is with Snaps,

05:45.360 --> 05:48.320
you can deliver additional functionality after the thing has been deployed.

05:48.320 --> 05:53.120
So it's not like a router that you install and then it's a fixed set of functionality.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.960
With Snaps, you can add functionality.

05:54.960 --> 05:58.400
So you could add an application and add a bit of extra hardware

05:58.400 --> 06:02.560
and make it shoot out rotating knives instead of picking up balls.

06:02.560 --> 06:03.360
It could do anything.

06:03.360 --> 06:04.160
It's brilliant.

06:04.160 --> 06:04.720
Yeah, it could.

06:04.720 --> 06:05.360
It definitely could.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.400
It could chase some of those.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.360
It could chase some chickens.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.320
It could throw knives.

06:08.320 --> 06:12.320
I mean, you know, yeah, maybe even maybe like an automated barbecue.

06:12.320 --> 06:15.600
Put a little barbecue on that thing and grill some hot dogs while you're playing.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.840
Wait, that's probably not the idea.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.120
This is getting to fantasy land.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.440
Autonomous Linux powered ball boy.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.880
And you can back it right now.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.200
They got an early backer, although those are all gone.

06:25.200 --> 06:25.760
You could get it now.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.280
You can still get it, though, for 600.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.320
Nope, that's all gone.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.840
Wow, this thing's really doing good.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.600
So there you go.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.480
Did that make you feel good?

06:32.480 --> 06:35.520
That was your feel good story to start us out because the next story is a bit heavy.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.640
I feel great.

06:36.640 --> 06:36.880
Good.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.000
I'm glad that worked.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.320
So let's talk about Tesla's GPL compliance.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.440
Oh, yeah, you may have seen this story.

06:43.440 --> 06:47.680
It started out with a blog post from the Software Freedom Conservancy on the status

06:47.680 --> 06:50.000
of Tesla's GPL compliance issues.

06:50.000 --> 06:50.880
So what's happened?

06:50.880 --> 06:53.440
So here's the practical aspect of what's happened.

06:53.440 --> 06:58.000
Tesla has just recently done a big dump of their Linux kernel branch.

06:58.880 --> 07:02.720
They just had like a generic user on GitHub called Tesla Open Source.

07:02.720 --> 07:07.280
And it looks like at some point they branched or forked the Linux kernel.

07:07.280 --> 07:14.800
They have made 676 changes in their code dump with 413,000 additions and 336 deletions.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.160
Also, in Buildroot, there's one commit per release.

07:18.160 --> 07:22.320
So there's like 643 change files in there, a bunch of additions, things like that.

07:22.320 --> 07:23.280
But it's nothing major.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.240
It's just this big, obtuse dump of code.

07:26.240 --> 07:31.680
And you can't really suss much out of it other than maybe there's some things that are missing.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.080
And that's where the Conservancy's blog post comes in.

07:34.560 --> 07:38.880
So the Software Freedom Conservancy wrote on May 18th, Bradley Kuhn did,

07:39.680 --> 07:44.480
that the Conservancy rarely talks about this stuff, that they try to keep the stuff under wraps

07:44.480 --> 07:47.920
as part of their community oriented GPL enforcement policy.

07:47.920 --> 07:51.680
They say they usually keep compliance matters confidential, not for their own sake,

07:51.680 --> 07:57.520
but for the sake of the violators who request discretion and want to fix their mistakes

07:57.520 --> 08:00.000
without fear of public reprisal.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.920
I guess that would be like GPL shaming, Wes?

08:01.920 --> 08:02.640
Yeah, probably.

08:02.640 --> 08:07.120
And I can see that if they're showing goodwill, they're showing that they do want to get this corrected.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.800
Sometimes, much like in security, you can have things go public a little too soon

08:10.800 --> 08:13.440
and they don't have time to get the public face that they want.

08:13.440 --> 08:16.880
Now, that may not seem fair, but I think from a pragmatic angle of,

08:16.880 --> 08:20.800
we just want this code to be released and for the public to benefit, it probably makes sense.

08:20.800 --> 08:21.280
Yeah.

08:21.280 --> 08:24.800
So they write, they being the Conservancy, right, that we're glad that this week,

08:24.800 --> 08:30.000
Tesla has accepted to publicly address its GPL violations,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.320
and they've taken their first steps towards compliance.

08:32.320 --> 08:38.320
The Conservancy has been engaging with Tesla on its GPL compliance issues since June 2013.

08:38.880 --> 08:44.400
That's when the Conservancy advised Tesla that they had received multiple reports of GPL violations

08:44.400 --> 08:46.240
regarding Tesla's Model S.

08:46.800 --> 08:52.800
Customers who had purchased the Tesla Model S received onboard systems that contained BusyBox

08:52.800 --> 08:57.600
and Linux, and did not receive any source code nor an offer for the source.

08:58.160 --> 09:02.960
In parallel, we also asked other entities to advise Tesla about GPL compliance.

09:02.960 --> 09:06.560
We know that Tesla received useful GPL compliance advice from multiple organizations

09:06.560 --> 09:08.080
in addition to the Conservancy.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.600
Let's pause here for a second, though.

09:09.600 --> 09:13.280
So what they're saying in here is that Tesla owners,

09:14.560 --> 09:18.400
and some of them are going to be Linux users, they got their new shiny car,

09:18.400 --> 09:19.920
and they start looking at the UI, and all of a sudden, they're like,

09:19.920 --> 09:21.280
wait a minute, this is BusyBox.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.920
This is Linux. Well, where's the source?

09:23.920 --> 09:29.920
But you also have to wonder if maybe BusyBox didn't raise a red flag,

09:29.920 --> 09:31.360
because they seem to come up a lot.

09:31.360 --> 09:37.440
Like BusyBox seems to bring up GPL compliance issues more than most projects we talk about.

09:37.440 --> 09:41.440
Like I think the VMware case is famously a BusyBox case.

09:42.240 --> 09:46.080
So this is one of those where is what's going on here is BusyBox being aggressive.

09:46.080 --> 09:51.600
I've heard people suggest that perhaps BusyBox is GPL shaming Tesla into doing this.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.040
Bobby, do you have any thoughts on that?

09:53.040 --> 09:54.960
No, I think this is reasonable.

09:54.960 --> 10:00.320
Like BusyBox comes up a lot just because they're not necessarily significantly more

10:00.320 --> 10:05.280
litigious than anyone else, but the significant copyright holder in BusyBox

10:05.280 --> 10:11.840
is quite active in ensuring people are compliant with the law under which they receive the software,

10:11.840 --> 10:13.440
the license under which they receive the software.

10:13.440 --> 10:17.520
So it's perfectly reasonable who someone who has spent some time and effort making a visa software

10:17.520 --> 10:21.920
and has licensed it on a free license should be able to expect the people who use that

10:21.920 --> 10:27.200
should give back in the way that's expected under the license. I think that's reasonable.

10:27.200 --> 10:31.600
Yeah, and BusyBox just seems to be one of the projects that's more active in doing that.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.560
Other projects seem to be a little more relaxed.

10:34.560 --> 10:38.400
And I think both approaches, you could argue, one is probably more corporate friendly,

10:38.400 --> 10:40.160
but one is more defensive.

10:40.160 --> 10:43.920
It seems like in this space too, BusyBox ends up getting shipped in embedded spaces

10:43.920 --> 10:48.240
where you end up with some sort of appliance-like device or somewhere not necessarily directly accessible.

10:48.240 --> 10:54.160
It's not a desktop Linux environment most of the time. So it's a bad situation on both sides.

10:54.160 --> 10:57.840
Yeah, and I bet you there's way more abuses in those embedded spaces

10:57.840 --> 10:59.200
where they think they're getting away with something.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.840
Oh, there's only going to sell a few hundred thousand, nobody will even know.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.040
And they sneak it in there.

11:03.040 --> 11:08.720
I think it's twofold in the sense that they now have also the deniability when something wrong happens

11:08.720 --> 11:13.200
that they have to investigate first if the car was hacked or modified,

11:13.200 --> 11:16.400
because ultimately they release part of their source code.

11:16.400 --> 11:21.840
And that's something that they, of course, can benefit from while also looking good for open source communities.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.240
So it's just like it's win-win-win in all fronts.

11:24.240 --> 11:27.920
Yeah, I see what you're saying. And for the conservancy's part,

11:27.920 --> 11:31.920
they said that when they first contacted Tesla, they started working in different ways

11:31.920 --> 11:38.320
to try to convince upstream providers like Nvidia and Parrot to disclose complete course management.

11:38.320 --> 11:42.720
Corresponding source code. So you're going to see this acronym tossed around a lot in these cases.

11:42.720 --> 11:46.560
CCS. That stands for complete corresponding source code.

11:46.560 --> 11:49.680
And it's like, so you got some GPL code that also touches some other code.

11:49.680 --> 11:53.040
We'd like to have that too. Nvidia.

11:53.040 --> 11:57.280
During that time, Tesla privately provided the conservancy with multiple rounds of

11:57.280 --> 11:58.880
complete corresponding source code.

11:58.880 --> 12:02.320
And then the conservancy spent a considerable amount of time digging through that

12:02.320 --> 12:06.880
and trying to validate if it was complete or not and then sending it back and saying, no, this is missing.

12:06.880 --> 12:10.080
And that is the longest, most grueling part of this process.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.000
And this week, that's when things changed.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.400
This week, Tesla took a new and different approach.

12:14.400 --> 12:20.800
They elected to publish their incomplete, incomplete, complete corresponding source.

12:20.800 --> 12:24.400
So like their candidates for complete source on GitHub.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.040
They're working on it.

12:25.040 --> 12:28.960
Yeah, it's going to be almost there. And this is what we got so far.

12:28.960 --> 12:34.560
Now, of course, it's sort of also going to open up Tesla for people knocking on their door,

12:34.560 --> 12:37.520
just drive bys that are going to look through that and go, hey, I've noticed you're missing this.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.880
And that can be a good thing or a bad thing.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.880
It might help nudge Tesla into compliance.

12:40.880 --> 12:45.680
But you got to wonder, was there some ticking clock behind the scenes that forced them to do

12:45.680 --> 12:47.120
this big code dump all of a sudden?

12:47.840 --> 12:52.320
And when you read through this post, it's clear that the conservancy is trying to position this as,

12:52.320 --> 12:58.480
hey, guys, this is some of the work that we do on a routine basis that we don't get to tell you about.

12:58.480 --> 12:59.440
Would you please donate?

12:59.440 --> 13:00.880
Please donate.

13:00.880 --> 13:01.680
We're over here.

13:01.680 --> 13:05.040
We're doing a lot of good work because they don't normally get to talk about this stuff.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.360
So I think they wanted to take the opportunity.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.600
Karen and Bradley want to take the opportunity to point that out.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.040
Yeah, it's nice to see Tesla.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.480
You know, I think there's oftentimes where where it can be contentious, right?

13:14.480 --> 13:17.920
They don't they want to the company wants to admit the minimal version that they can.

13:17.920 --> 13:19.920
They struggle to go to the licenses, right?

13:19.920 --> 13:20.880
And it's just a big hassle.

13:20.880 --> 13:26.080
So Tesla can feels comfortable doing this in the open, especially as not a traditional automaker,

13:26.080 --> 13:29.440
but something that we see a little bit more as a tech savvy tech first company.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.760
It's nice to see them going in the right direction.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.520
Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.200
OK, let's now let's pick it back up again.

13:35.200 --> 13:35.920
Let's keep moving.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.360
I want to talk about a video game.

13:37.360 --> 13:41.760
Haven't talked about games in a while on this show, so I had to have a good reason to finally do it.

13:41.760 --> 13:42.880
And it's slipstream.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.280
It released yesterday as we record this.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.120
And here's the cool thing about slipstream.

13:47.120 --> 13:53.840
It's a retro inspired arcade racer that was developed exclusively on Linux, Ubuntu and

13:53.840 --> 13:59.600
Arch Linux to be specific, using free software tools such as Corita, Blender and GIMP for the graphics,

13:59.600 --> 14:04.880
IntelliJ for the IDE, and not a single sprite of the game was made using any proprietary or

14:04.880 --> 14:06.720
Windows software such as Photoshop.

14:07.280 --> 14:12.240
And the author of the software says it's not really even a political statement.

14:12.960 --> 14:17.120
It's just feels better when I work on Linux and free software.

14:17.120 --> 14:17.760
So that's what I do.

14:18.960 --> 14:19.760
How do you like that?

14:19.760 --> 14:20.480
That's awesome.

14:20.480 --> 14:21.120
That's kind of perfect.

14:21.120 --> 14:21.680
It's not.

14:21.680 --> 14:22.480
It's not annoying.

14:22.480 --> 14:23.840
It's not nagging.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.680
It's not some sort of Linux centric evangelism.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.600
It's just, hey, guys, this platform works.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.320
I got this done.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.440
Check out the cool shit I made.

14:29.440 --> 14:29.920
Yeah.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.280
And it started as a Kickstarter.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.880
Four hundred and forty three pledges.

14:32.880 --> 14:37.040
They raised seven thousand dollars to get things finished and now it's available on Steam.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.800
And it is really nice.

14:38.800 --> 14:45.200
It's it's very authentic in a way, but at the same time, it's it's got newer features like the

14:45.200 --> 14:49.280
parallax scrolling looks way cooler than it ever did back in the day.

14:49.280 --> 14:54.080
It's still a 2D sort of 3D pursuit of game pseudo game.

14:54.080 --> 14:59.760
Twenty different tracks, three different game modes, a lot like Mario Kart, five car models,

14:59.760 --> 15:04.640
supposedly a pretty good soundtrack, too, and a variety of different options to customize the

15:04.640 --> 15:08.960
game's visuals, including a high flute and 30 frames per second mode.

15:08.960 --> 15:16.160
And if you are a masochist, it also has a CRT mode, which no, just don't.

15:16.160 --> 15:16.800
I just don't.

15:16.800 --> 15:17.440
That's awesome.

15:17.440 --> 15:18.400
I don't know.

15:18.400 --> 15:22.560
Can you use the CRT mode on your CRT if you have one or is that too much?

15:22.560 --> 15:24.560
That's double the that's double the punishment.

15:24.560 --> 15:28.640
I was going to say double the pain, but that you'd probably that's something else.

15:28.640 --> 15:29.200
Yeah.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.320
So that's pretty cool.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.080
It's called Slipstream Retro Inspired Racer.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.720
It's available up on that next cloud right now.

15:34.720 --> 15:38.400
Hey, I want to talk about speaking of hitting the road, my trip to Texas, just a couple of quick

15:38.400 --> 15:39.920
public service announcements.

15:39.920 --> 15:44.160
I'm going to Texas Linux Fest, as I've mentioned, and so we have officially launched the Jupiter

15:44.160 --> 15:50.640
Broadcasting Telegram group, and you can find that at jupitabroadcasting.com slash Texas.

15:50.640 --> 15:54.880
And that's where we're going to be planning all of our meetups, our barbecue events and just

15:54.880 --> 15:58.960
shenanigans around Texas Linux Fest, which is June 8th through the 9th in Austin.

15:59.680 --> 16:05.280
And that's jupitabroadcasting.com slash Texas to join that where we'd love to chat with you.

16:05.280 --> 16:09.840
If you're in the area and you can follow me on my way down there, jupitabroadcasting.com slash

16:09.840 --> 16:10.960
Rover if you want to meet up.

16:10.960 --> 16:14.160
But I want to tell you a little more about why I'm going on this trip to Texas.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.480
It's not just for Texas Linux Fest.

16:16.480 --> 16:21.200
And I mean, it kind of is now, but that wasn't the spark for this Texas fire.

16:21.680 --> 16:24.240
Maybe I should use a different analogy, but that's not what started this thing.

16:24.720 --> 16:30.640
What started this thing was an email that I sent Linux Academy, who is based out of Keller,

16:30.640 --> 16:35.120
Texas a month or so ago, and maybe a little more than that.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.720
And what it basically was, was, hey, I was watching your live stream.

16:38.720 --> 16:40.800
And I noticed a couple of technical issues.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.480
Would you like to chat more?

16:42.480 --> 16:44.800
And maybe I could help consult for free.

16:44.800 --> 16:45.680
I wasn't trying to charge them.

16:45.680 --> 16:48.560
I just wanted to help them out because they've been a great sponsor for years.

16:49.360 --> 16:52.000
And they said, yes, we would love to talk.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.120
In fact, we'd love to talk a little more about that.

16:55.120 --> 17:01.120
And so a long story short, Linux Academy has grown like crazy in the last year and so.

17:01.840 --> 17:02.960
I don't know how much of this.

17:02.960 --> 17:04.800
I think they have talked about this on their live stream.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.000
It's over 100 employees.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.640
I think it might even be over 110 employees.

17:08.640 --> 17:09.120
That's huge.

17:09.120 --> 17:09.680
Yeah.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.800
Can you imagine a small business as adding employees like that?

17:12.800 --> 17:16.560
And it's a lot of instructors and developers.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.200
I mean, it's just they're bringing, they're onboarding people like crazy.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.840
And it's a huge process to scale out like that.

17:21.840 --> 17:26.720
And Anthony, the CEO of Linux Academy, has built a really solid team around him.

17:26.720 --> 17:30.720
I had a good chat, and I was really impressed with that aspect of the company.

17:30.720 --> 17:35.360
But they've had the main challenge is just getting all those people on board, you know,

17:35.360 --> 17:37.200
not wrecking the culture.

17:37.200 --> 17:44.160
And the one thing that sort of slipped was the Linux doctrine, you know, the following.

17:44.160 --> 17:48.320
Everything's Linux because you just at that scale, you really can't mandate that everybody

17:48.320 --> 17:52.720
coming on board be a Linux desktop user and that everything they do be done from the Linux

17:52.720 --> 17:53.200
desktop.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.720
You just that's sort of impractical.

17:55.280 --> 17:58.480
And so they're like, what we want to do, though, is start a Linux Academy.

17:58.480 --> 18:01.360
And so they're like, what we want to do, though, is start addressing that now.

18:01.360 --> 18:02.880
We want to get back to Linux.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.960
You start make start writing that ship.

18:04.960 --> 18:12.880
And what they want to do is take the experience that we have, Noah and I, converting Jupyter

18:12.880 --> 18:19.200
Broadcasting from Mac OS and Wirecast to OBS and Linux and Kubuntu specifically, because

18:19.200 --> 18:20.080
that's their setup now.

18:20.080 --> 18:23.680
Like they've they've really they've really done a good job of integrating live services

18:24.320 --> 18:27.440
into their courseware, into their service offering.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.560
And they've really pulled off some amazing stuff, but they're just doing it all on a

18:30.560 --> 18:31.920
Mac with Wirecast.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.600
And, you know, it's functional.

18:33.600 --> 18:34.320
It works.

18:34.320 --> 18:37.520
But they're Linux Academy, so they want to do it on Linux and they want us to come down

18:37.520 --> 18:41.360
there and help them essentially do what we've done semi recently here in the studio while

18:41.360 --> 18:42.400
it's still fresh.

18:42.400 --> 18:43.440
And we're really enjoying it.

18:43.440 --> 18:44.720
It's working rock solid.

18:44.720 --> 18:48.240
And the great thing about it is like one of those things I'm excited to do because it's

18:48.240 --> 18:54.640
not just, oh, we're replacing a Mac for for because sake, it's a better solution.

18:54.640 --> 18:57.600
You know, it's better performance, better stability.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.520
It's way more sustainable.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.880
The way more hardware options is much more flexible.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.800
It's a better long term solution.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.400
It's Linux and OBS.

19:06.400 --> 19:09.760
Whenever you can build your your infrastructure around open source software just gives you

19:09.760 --> 19:11.680
way better sustainability and flexibility down the road.

19:11.680 --> 19:12.960
That's true for broadcasting as well.

19:14.480 --> 19:18.560
So sensibly, the trip was about going to Linux Academy to convert their broadcast systems

19:18.560 --> 19:19.120
to Linux.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.600
And then the time you worked out, Texas Linux Fest sort of came up and now it's really become

19:23.600 --> 19:25.200
one of the core focuses.

19:25.200 --> 19:30.240
And so along this whole trip, I'm going to try to do the shows.

19:30.240 --> 19:31.760
I'm going to try to keep things going.

19:32.400 --> 19:37.040
And we wanted to put a shirt out there that might help cover some of our expenses while

19:37.040 --> 19:41.920
we do this, while we get down to Texas, while we keep doing shows from the road, while we

19:41.920 --> 19:42.720
do the meetups.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.160
So we've launched a new shirt.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.480
It's teespring.com slash J.B.

19:46.480 --> 19:46.880
Texas.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.000
Check this thing out.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.080
Now this is a couple of things have gone into the shirt.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.120
You may you may have noticed we haven't done any swag for a while.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.880
It's because we've been thinking about this a little bit.

19:55.520 --> 19:59.600
There is something we want to do with our swag that makes it uniquely ours.

20:00.240 --> 20:05.200
Whenever we have tux on our swag, we want tux with a beard because we think our tux

20:05.200 --> 20:06.400
has earned that beard.

20:06.400 --> 20:11.200
After 11 plus years of the Linux action show, we earned that beard.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.160
So our swag is going to have a bearded tux.

20:14.160 --> 20:17.280
That's going to be one of the trademark things about Jupiter broadcasting.

20:17.280 --> 20:20.240
And this is one of the only second times we've done this.

20:20.240 --> 20:23.440
The last time was the final Linux action show shirt.

20:24.400 --> 20:28.800
This is a Jupiter broadcasting, limited edition, Texas 2018 shirt.

20:28.800 --> 20:33.440
It's got the circular logo like last used to have, but a special Texas edition of tux

20:33.440 --> 20:37.520
with a beard holding the rocket, teespring.com slash J.B.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.000
Texas.

20:38.480 --> 20:39.920
It's a great t-shirt.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.840
I love this particular material.

20:41.840 --> 20:46.720
And I really, really like the way the white pops on some of the bolder colors and also

20:46.720 --> 20:50.320
the way it really pops on that blue and on the purple.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.880
It's slick looking teespring.com slash J.B.

20:52.880 --> 20:53.440
Texas.

20:53.440 --> 20:55.120
Yeah, you'll be sure you're looking hot.

20:55.120 --> 20:55.920
Sure.

20:55.920 --> 20:56.960
Yeah, right.

20:56.960 --> 20:57.920
I'm going to get you one, Wes.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.520
So don't you worry about we'll get you one.

20:59.520 --> 21:00.160
Thank you.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.440
Yeah, I am.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.200
I am supremely looking forward to this trip.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.000
I'll wear it with pride.

21:04.000 --> 21:04.560
Yeah, you will.

21:04.560 --> 21:05.280
You know what, Wes?

21:05.280 --> 21:08.800
You'll look dapper in it, too, and put it put like a scarf and I like a hat with it.

21:08.800 --> 21:13.120
I mean, yes, I'm just saying you'd be a lady killer out in the town of Seattle.

21:13.120 --> 21:15.120
So anyways, super excited about the trip.

21:15.120 --> 21:16.080
Really looking forward to it.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.160
You can track me on my way down there if you want to meet up.

21:18.160 --> 21:21.520
And then if you're going to be in the Texas area, join that telegram group,

21:21.520 --> 21:23.760
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Texas.

21:23.760 --> 21:28.640
We'll have a link to all this stuff if you don't want to worry about the URLs.

21:28.640 --> 21:31.360
It'll just be linuxunplug.com slash 250.

21:31.360 --> 21:34.160
So new swag, big trip coming up.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.240
I leave after Linux Action News this week.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.960
We finish up that and then I hit the road.

21:39.520 --> 21:41.280
I'll be on my way to Tejas.

21:41.280 --> 21:43.200
Now you make sure to drive safe, OK?

21:43.200 --> 21:46.240
Because we need you here at the network.

21:46.240 --> 21:46.800
I'm not.

21:46.800 --> 21:51.600
It's going to be an interesting juggling act because doing the shows

21:51.600 --> 21:55.200
while I drive to Texas adds a ton of time to the travel time

21:55.200 --> 21:57.840
because you have the time it takes to record the shows.

21:57.840 --> 22:01.120
Plus, I edit a handful of the shows and the time to prep the shows

22:01.760 --> 22:03.280
and the time to find connectivity.

22:04.160 --> 22:06.000
It's going to be challenging, to say the least.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.240
So if you're not subscribed to a show and you want to make sure you don't miss it

22:08.240 --> 22:10.480
in case there's something that floats, now would be a good time.

22:10.480 --> 22:11.520
But let's change gears.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.120
Let's talk about Mycroft.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.840
It's time to get to the bottom of what are beans.

22:15.840 --> 22:18.320
And Mycroft is introducing blockchain.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.960
And I'm going to give you a challenge, Wes.

22:20.960 --> 22:21.680
Are you ready?

22:21.680 --> 22:22.400
Oh, yeah.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.160
The challenge is I will read this.

22:24.880 --> 22:27.520
I've gone through and I've surmised it into a few choice quotes.

22:27.520 --> 22:28.640
I'll read through them.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.520
And then I want you to describe to me how the blockchain

22:31.520 --> 22:33.920
will be functional on Mycroft, OK?

22:33.920 --> 22:34.420
Yes.

22:35.040 --> 22:38.480
OK, so we'll start with is the blockchain necessary?

22:38.480 --> 22:42.080
One of the biggest themes was determining the necessity of adding blockchain.

22:42.080 --> 22:44.320
After all, we could simply build a distributed system

22:44.320 --> 22:46.960
using peer to peer technology or better yet,

22:46.960 --> 22:51.120
focus on the core technology to build something that's valuable without blockchain.

22:51.120 --> 22:54.240
As we examined blockchain and debated the tough questions,

22:54.240 --> 22:58.800
it felt like technology could be a very it felt like that technology

22:58.800 --> 23:02.240
could be a very good fit for Mycroft and our ideals.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.720
Oh, and that's another thing.

23:04.720 --> 23:08.240
Does it make sense for Mycroft to develop its own chain?

23:08.240 --> 23:10.720
Yes, unequivocally, yes.

23:11.280 --> 23:15.600
We've carefully evaluated solutions from existing blockchain communities

23:15.600 --> 23:18.320
and none have the features we are looking for.

23:18.320 --> 23:22.800
We need to protect user privacy, store large volumes of data

23:22.800 --> 23:25.200
and securely distribute API services.

23:25.680 --> 23:30.960
Finally, we get a lot of questions about what a Mycroft crypto mining community

23:30.960 --> 23:31.920
might look like.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.840
Will it be large enough?

23:33.840 --> 23:39.520
Yes, a Mycroft token would be designed so that the mark one, the mark two

23:39.520 --> 23:42.400
and the mark three, which you don't know about yet,

23:42.400 --> 23:44.320
will be able to mine the coin.

23:44.320 --> 23:47.520
That means we'll instantly have thousands of devices

23:47.520 --> 23:51.760
participating in the network, of course, if they choose to opt in.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.600
OK, Wes, so how is the Mycroft using blockchain?

23:55.600 --> 24:00.640
OK, it's not really clear from this article a little bit a little bit lower down.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.600
They do talk about some things they want to incentivize.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.600
Things like secure storage for the network,

24:05.600 --> 24:07.920
development and maintenance of useful skills.

24:07.920 --> 24:11.440
And in an earlier blog post, they talk about a little bit of the motivations.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.120
I like the motivations.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.440
I like the idea that they want to become more decentralized.

24:15.440 --> 24:19.200
They don't want to have the usefulness of these open source devices

24:19.200 --> 24:22.880
reliant on some centralized incorporated entity.

24:23.360 --> 24:26.800
But there's a lot of hopeful speculation in here.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.920
Yeah, and it seems like a way to kind of grab some attention.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.520
You know, we've seen Kodak and other companies,

24:31.520 --> 24:34.160
you just sort of attach blockchain to a project or product

24:34.160 --> 24:36.560
and all of a sudden you get a lot more interest.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.120
Well, it lowers the cost of the product, for sure.

24:39.120 --> 24:40.160
That's one.

24:40.160 --> 24:42.080
They don't have to host the data

24:42.080 --> 24:45.360
and they don't have to comply necessarily with GBPR and this kind of stuff.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.680
I mean, I don't have anything. It's in the blockchain.

24:47.680 --> 24:50.560
So you think they're going to use it for distributed user data?

24:50.560 --> 24:53.600
Probably. I mean, if it's encrypted and protected, why not?

24:53.600 --> 24:55.200
It's going to serve the same purpose.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.640
But what about the idea of the Mycroft sitting there mining coin?

24:58.640 --> 25:00.800
Like, Popi, you've used one before.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.960
Is it a high-performance device?

25:03.920 --> 25:07.280
The one I had was the first generation, which is based on a Raspberry Pi.

25:07.280 --> 25:10.240
And if any of you have seen the videos that I've made,

25:10.240 --> 25:11.760
it's not super high-performance.

25:13.040 --> 25:16.960
And I guess part of that is because it was like version zero.

25:16.960 --> 25:19.520
You know, it wasn't a production-ready device.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.800
It was a dev. Fair enough.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.000
Which, you know, is fair.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.280
And I would expect consumer-level units.

25:25.280 --> 25:27.600
We're talking 18 months later.

25:27.600 --> 25:32.240
I would expect consumer-level devices to be a lot faster.

25:32.240 --> 25:37.120
I mean, I still have to wait for my Amazon Echo to reply.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.720
It's relatively quick.

25:39.280 --> 25:43.040
But there's a significantly higher delay with Mycroft

25:43.040 --> 25:48.320
than I think if you added in lots of heavy computational overhead on top of that.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.000
It's not going to get any quicker, is it?

25:50.000 --> 25:52.320
I would like to know some of the technical implementations

25:52.320 --> 25:56.400
because there's lots of types of coins that don't necessarily need a CPU or a GPU

25:56.400 --> 25:57.280
to do what they do.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.040
They don't need a CPU or a GPU.

25:59.040 --> 26:01.040
Where do they do their computing?

26:01.040 --> 26:01.680
No, I mean, they do.

26:01.680 --> 26:04.800
But I mean, they don't sit there and run the CPU at full peg.

26:04.800 --> 26:07.120
They're more like storage-based.

26:07.120 --> 26:10.480
I mean, I don't even know if my Amazon Echoes around the house

26:10.480 --> 26:15.120
are mining crypto coin or doing blockchain activities.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.880
I have no idea because it's all closed source.

26:16.880 --> 26:20.080
So the good thing is the stuff that's on Mycroft is,

26:20.080 --> 26:21.760
as I understand it, all going to be open source.

26:21.760 --> 26:23.440
So you could inspect that and see what it's doing

26:23.440 --> 26:26.320
and optimize it if you're so inclined.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.480
Yeah, the more we talk about it, I kind of like the idea.

26:28.480 --> 26:28.960
Right.

26:28.960 --> 26:31.040
I was kind of mocking it at first.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.440
But the more we talk about it, it does kind of make sense.

26:33.440 --> 26:36.240
And if you could do some sort of storage coin-based system,

26:37.440 --> 26:38.880
I'd actually be kind of into that.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.440
And if you think about it, if it could somehow,

26:42.720 --> 26:45.600
they would probably have to combine it with some sort of hosted blockchain

26:45.600 --> 26:47.680
because anything that got relatively large,

26:47.680 --> 26:51.280
you wouldn't want to waste storage or bandwidth

26:51.280 --> 26:52.960
to download and upload that thing.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.880
But you could maybe cache some of it.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.200
And so if you had some of your own information,

26:57.200 --> 26:58.320
it could store in a local chain

26:58.320 --> 27:00.320
and it could do lookups in the blockchain.

27:01.680 --> 27:03.440
That could be pretty compelling.

27:03.440 --> 27:06.800
And then it would be completely divorced from any cloud infrastructure

27:06.800 --> 27:09.440
other than the hosted part of the chain that could be offline.

27:09.440 --> 27:10.240
I don't know.

27:10.240 --> 27:11.760
I'd really like to know more about how they're going to do it.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.400
Depending how it's done potentially could mean that,

27:15.280 --> 27:18.640
let's say if the encryption is to a degree that they,

27:18.640 --> 27:21.760
for example, would have access to mine some of the data

27:21.760 --> 27:24.880
to improve the voice recognition, et cetera.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.160
Now they would still have access to that data.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.400
I'd hope at least to be able to do that.

27:31.840 --> 27:34.640
Having a key that they can access the voice records

27:34.640 --> 27:37.680
to be able to do that to improve voice recognition, for instance.

27:37.680 --> 27:41.600
And nothing says that they couldn't release the mining software

27:41.600 --> 27:44.720
for desktop computers like a Linux binary

27:44.720 --> 27:46.880
that you could run on a pretty powerful Linux desktop

27:46.880 --> 27:49.280
that could help add the value to your contribution

27:49.280 --> 27:50.960
to your Microsoft's contribution to the network.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.800
So, OK, all right.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.320
This is sounding less and less crazy.

27:54.320 --> 27:57.280
You know what this means is we're just going to have a future full of blockchain.

27:57.280 --> 28:00.400
Every blockchain, all the things, and it's going to get really annoying.

28:00.400 --> 28:01.520
That's what that means.

28:01.520 --> 28:05.200
No, it's until the energy bill is too high to people start realizing

28:05.200 --> 28:07.440
that we need something like blockchain,

28:07.440 --> 28:10.000
something decentralized, but not really blockchain.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.080
Yeah, or at least something that doesn't require so much compute power to verify.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.840
And I know there's some different projects that are working on that.

28:17.840 --> 28:19.920
I feel like, Wes and I, you and I looked at some,

28:19.920 --> 28:24.640
at some point, different projects that were using other means to validate the network,

28:24.640 --> 28:27.040
but none of them, I'm drawing a blank on all of them right now.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.440
Yeah, I mean, there's lots of different types of proof of stake

28:29.440 --> 28:32.240
or other schemes of distributed consensus.

28:32.240 --> 28:35.520
I think it's more of a question of how well is it proved out

28:35.520 --> 28:37.280
and will it actually scale?

28:37.280 --> 28:41.040
Will they really be able to transition from a centralized standard API design

28:41.040 --> 28:43.600
to a distributed blockchain that could actually provide

28:43.600 --> 28:46.160
the quick services needed for an interactive device?

28:46.720 --> 28:49.120
I don't know, but it would be really cool.

28:49.120 --> 28:52.400
Yeah, and I'm ready to hook it up to my Linux desktop now.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.680
You guys got me so excited.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.120
All right, let's take a moment and thank Linux Academy,

28:57.120 --> 28:59.120
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

28:59.120 --> 29:03.360
You can go there to support the show and sign up for a free seven-day trial,

29:03.360 --> 29:05.760
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

29:05.760 --> 29:08.160
It's a platform to learn more about Linux,

29:08.160 --> 29:10.080
and they really are a company that's passionate about Linux.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.320
I mean, that's why they want me to come down there,

29:12.320 --> 29:16.160
is to help write that ship and make sure that they're using Linux throughout the company.

29:16.160 --> 29:18.240
And they have professionals that are there full-time

29:18.240 --> 29:20.080
that can help you whenever you have questions.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.600
And they really know their stuff.

29:21.600 --> 29:26.000
They have hands-on labs, scenario-based labs that give you real experience on servers,

29:26.000 --> 29:29.600
self-paced in-depth video courses on every Linux cloud and DevOps topic.

29:29.600 --> 29:35.680
And they have simultaneous servers they spin up for you simultaneously with the courseware.

29:35.680 --> 29:38.000
So as you're going along with the courseware, the servers spin up,

29:38.000 --> 29:41.360
you SSH in, you do work on real servers, that kind of stuff.

29:41.360 --> 29:42.400
It's really slick.

29:42.400 --> 29:44.240
And they have a course scheduler if you're busy,

29:44.240 --> 29:46.640
you got a lot of stuff going on, you can pick a course,

29:46.640 --> 29:50.000
set a time frame to fit your schedule, and set some learning goals.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.680
And if it's time for certifications, they've got courses created specifically

29:53.680 --> 29:55.600
to prepare you for those exams.

29:55.600 --> 29:59.040
And if you have just a little bit of time, maybe an evening here or there,

29:59.040 --> 30:01.840
they have deep dives, single topic deep dives, you can just choose.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.120
I have 15 minutes.

30:03.120 --> 30:03.920
Here's what you can do.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.320
I got five minutes, I got two hours.

30:06.320 --> 30:07.120
It's pretty nice.

30:07.120 --> 30:10.560
And then to combine all that together and really kind of put the sprinkle on top,

30:10.560 --> 30:13.360
they got stuff you can do offline, like study guides and lesson audio,

30:13.360 --> 30:15.600
which is super useful, like if you're on a road trip,

30:15.600 --> 30:19.120
just saying, and they also have iOS and Android apps as well.

30:19.120 --> 30:21.440
So get started by going to linuxacademy.com

30:21.440 --> 30:22.400
slash unplugged.

30:22.400 --> 30:24.720
That's linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

30:24.720 --> 30:28.000
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.480
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.800
Boobaladoop, boobaladoop, boobaladoop, boobaladoop.

30:32.800 --> 30:38.000
So there is some hot canonical rumors on techcrunch.com today.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.320
It always strikes my fancy when I see TechCrunch writing about canonical,

30:42.320 --> 30:45.680
like they're this nebulous company.

30:45.680 --> 30:47.760
I don't know, it's this weird detached form of writing.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.120
It's fascinating.

30:49.120 --> 30:53.680
And they say, don't expect the Ubuntu maker to IPO this year.

30:53.680 --> 30:56.400
And they got some choice quotes with Mark Shuttleworth

30:56.400 --> 30:59.760
when he was at OpenStack Summit in Vancouver,

30:59.760 --> 31:01.840
which sounds like it was a hell of a party.

31:01.840 --> 31:04.720
And they say that, Mark says that we decided as a company,

31:04.720 --> 31:06.640
and it's not just my decision, but we decided

31:06.640 --> 31:09.120
that we want to have a commercial focus.

31:09.120 --> 31:12.480
So we picked cloud and IoT as the areas to develop that.

31:12.480 --> 31:15.200
And being a public company, given that most of our customers

31:15.200 --> 31:17.760
are now global institution, it makes for us also

31:17.760 --> 31:19.040
be a global institution.

31:19.040 --> 31:22.560
I think it would be great for my team to be part of a public company.

31:22.560 --> 31:25.360
It would be a lot of work, but we're not shy of work.

31:25.360 --> 31:26.880
And think about what he's saying there.

31:26.880 --> 31:28.320
We serve global companies.

31:28.320 --> 31:31.040
We should be a global company.

31:31.040 --> 31:33.120
Now, Shuttleworth didn't really necessarily

31:33.120 --> 31:35.680
want to talk about a timeline for the IPO.

31:35.680 --> 31:38.720
He said we will do the right thing at the right time.

31:38.720 --> 31:40.960
But that's likely not this year.

31:40.960 --> 31:44.880
There is a process that you have to go through, and it takes time.

31:44.880 --> 31:48.000
We know what we need to hit in terms of revenue and growth,

31:48.000 --> 31:49.840
and we're on track.

31:49.840 --> 31:52.560
The company's focus is squarely on enterprise,

31:52.560 --> 31:56.000
and they have big offerings now with OpenStack and Kubernetes.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.400
But it doesn't necessarily mean they've forgotten the desktop.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.560
Shuttleworth told TechCrunch the desktop team

32:00.560 --> 32:02.960
has remained the same size as before.

32:02.960 --> 32:05.520
And he noted that the desktop is still a passion for him.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.280
We took some big risks a year ago.

32:07.280 --> 32:09.520
We cut a bunch of stuff that people loved about us,

32:09.520 --> 32:12.320
but we had to see if people were going to respond commercially.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.400
That move is paying off now, though.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.720
During a keynote earlier at OpenStack,

32:16.720 --> 32:18.480
Mark Shuttleworth noted that Canonical

32:18.480 --> 32:21.920
is now in talks for about 200 new deployments for 2018.

32:21.920 --> 32:23.920
And I don't know what kind of deployments they're talking about.

32:23.920 --> 32:27.840
I assume OpenStack deployments up from about 40 in 2017.

32:27.840 --> 32:30.640
They're kind of vague with some of the details there.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.400
But since it's an OpenStack conference,

32:32.400 --> 32:35.600
I would assume that is the context for that quote.

32:35.600 --> 32:38.800
Hmm, so no IPO this year.

32:38.800 --> 32:44.640
I thought an IPO in 2018, when that was sort of bubbling up,

32:44.640 --> 32:47.920
seemed pretty aggressive.

32:47.920 --> 32:51.440
But it doesn't really seem like it changes anything.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.480
It just seems like, OK, this is noteworthy.

32:53.480 --> 32:54.200
Yeah, exactly.

32:54.200 --> 32:56.320
And it makes sense that if you're already well-positioned,

32:56.320 --> 32:57.980
if you're already doing well, that you'd

32:57.980 --> 33:01.080
want to wait until you're at the right stride at the moment,

33:01.080 --> 33:02.880
you have a lot of prospects, and that people

33:02.880 --> 33:05.260
are excited about you because you want your IPO to go well.

33:05.260 --> 33:06.920
Yeah, it really is all about striking

33:06.920 --> 33:08.580
the moment at the right time.

33:08.580 --> 33:12.480
And part of doing this right is knowing when that moment is

33:12.480 --> 33:15.400
and not shooting before it's arrived.

33:15.400 --> 33:18.320
There's a risk also if doing it in the wrong time

33:18.320 --> 33:21.760
to lose control, which is the risk of IPO.

33:21.760 --> 33:23.640
What do you have in mind when you say that?

33:23.640 --> 33:25.640
Sounds like you have something specifically in mind.

33:25.640 --> 33:28.420
No, it's just you're allowing other people

33:28.420 --> 33:30.080
to be part of your company.

33:30.080 --> 33:31.840
That's what an IPO does.

33:31.840 --> 33:36.800
And that comes with other people having a say at times.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.760
So you definitely want to do it in a time

33:38.760 --> 33:41.160
that you have a good vision, strong position,

33:41.160 --> 33:43.720
that it's hard to move away, so you

33:43.720 --> 33:45.740
benefit from having the cash flow,

33:45.740 --> 33:47.760
but not necessarily have the pressure

33:47.760 --> 33:50.200
to conform to new owners.

33:50.200 --> 33:52.280
Yeah, I follow you.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.560
All right, I think that's probably enough on that.

33:54.560 --> 33:56.180
So let's talk about an app pick that you

33:56.180 --> 33:57.640
might find pretty useful.

33:57.640 --> 34:00.960
It will launch commands when you press a combination of keys

34:00.960 --> 34:01.680
on your system.

34:01.680 --> 34:05.000
Like, think of an auto-destruct or maybe just something

34:05.000 --> 34:06.740
more benign, like mounting, unmounting,

34:06.740 --> 34:07.660
or something like that.

34:07.660 --> 34:11.080
But what it is, it's shortcut D. It reads kernel input device

34:11.080 --> 34:12.440
nodes directly, so there's no need

34:12.440 --> 34:13.920
for any graphical environment.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.800
It works on whatever the software stack you're using is,

34:16.800 --> 34:20.760
supports blocking and non-blocking command spawns,

34:20.760 --> 34:23.200
and it's resilient to keyboard hot plugs.

34:23.200 --> 34:26.440
So you can plug your keyboard in only when needed,

34:26.440 --> 34:30.040
execute the combo, and then unplug it.

34:30.040 --> 34:32.240
And it will actually tolerate that.

34:32.240 --> 34:37.240
It's written, though, as your favorite part, in Node.js.

34:37.240 --> 34:39.320
And it's been designed to execute low-level

34:39.320 --> 34:43.040
administrative commands, like so, say, systemctl start

34:43.040 --> 34:44.520
sum.service.

34:44.520 --> 34:47.320
And you just press a combo on your keyboard

34:47.320 --> 34:49.080
or on a headless system.

34:49.080 --> 34:53.400
How useful could this be on a headless server in your house?

34:53.400 --> 34:55.440
Or even a little arm box.

34:55.440 --> 34:58.200
And it'll execute a series of things.

34:58.200 --> 34:59.080
Pretty nice, Wes.

34:59.080 --> 34:59.720
You found this.

34:59.720 --> 35:01.240
I got to say, this is pretty nice.

35:01.240 --> 35:04.360
Did you have anything in mind when you found this shortcut D?

35:04.360 --> 35:07.120
You know, I don't have any actual direct day-to-day use

35:07.120 --> 35:08.660
cases, but I've been playing with it.

35:08.660 --> 35:10.960
And I can see now just sort of small things in my life

35:10.960 --> 35:12.200
that I could make more convenient.

35:12.200 --> 35:13.620
And personally, I was interested.

35:13.620 --> 35:15.120
It seems like kind of a good idea.

35:15.120 --> 35:18.680
For me, I usually end up having Node the runtime installed

35:18.680 --> 35:21.260
anyway, so a Node script is fine.

35:21.260 --> 35:22.640
But I was also kind of wondering,

35:22.640 --> 35:24.620
I wonder if anyone else has seen a similar program,

35:24.620 --> 35:26.040
but maybe something written in Go,

35:26.040 --> 35:29.040
static binary, or just a classic C program

35:29.040 --> 35:30.040
that does the same thing.

35:30.040 --> 35:30.720
I've seen worse.

35:30.720 --> 35:34.120
Node OS still releases and still up there.

35:34.120 --> 35:39.400
I mean, last release was in June 12, 2017, but it is there.

35:39.400 --> 35:42.080
Like, your primary shell is Node.

35:42.080 --> 35:43.920
So that exists.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.080
Animals.

35:45.080 --> 35:46.400
Animals is what that is.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.320
That's just barbaric.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.160
OK.

35:49.160 --> 35:51.160
Well, while we're talking about performance,

35:51.160 --> 35:52.200
let's talk about Gnome.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.880
Gnome is having a performance hack fest.

35:54.880 --> 35:55.680
It had one, I guess.

35:55.680 --> 35:57.160
I think it's actually done now.

35:57.160 --> 36:01.260
And when I grabbed the story, I believe it was going on.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.840
But it's happening in Cambridge, and that always

36:03.840 --> 36:06.840
means good weather and pub evenings, as they say.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.840
And there's a couple of tidbits that I pulled away

36:08.840 --> 36:11.000
from a blog post from Carlos.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.200
Number one that I noticed is that xwayland1.20

36:14.200 --> 36:17.200
seems to have some large improvements for battery life

36:17.200 --> 36:17.940
on a laptop.

36:17.940 --> 36:20.560
They managed to drop it down to a significant,

36:20.560 --> 36:24.720
from a 20-watt draw to eight or nine-watt draw.

36:24.720 --> 36:26.440
That's a good drop right there.

36:26.440 --> 36:28.400
And some other improvements, like work

36:28.400 --> 36:31.280
towards having Mudder dump a detailed per-frame information

36:31.280 --> 36:32.840
so that way they can visualize.

36:32.840 --> 36:34.300
They can actually graph and visualize

36:34.300 --> 36:38.320
where every single little nuance and slowdown is.

36:38.320 --> 36:38.880
Nice.

36:38.880 --> 36:40.040
And it sounds like some other projects

36:40.040 --> 36:41.760
might be doing that, too, yeah.

36:41.760 --> 36:43.160
And there's some other nice progress

36:43.160 --> 36:46.380
towards getting GDM to consume as little resources as possible

36:46.380 --> 36:47.760
when switched away, which has been

36:47.760 --> 36:49.560
one of my complaints about GDMs.

36:49.560 --> 36:51.440
It's like a whole other Gnome session running,

36:51.440 --> 36:54.160
and so they're working on actually tightening that up.

36:54.160 --> 36:57.120
There has been some work to make 2D sessions work better

36:57.120 --> 37:01.000
in Gnome Classic, where you have what they call purely 2D

37:01.000 --> 37:05.040
actors, which is kind of a cool OpenGL term, I think.

37:05.040 --> 37:07.000
And ways to prove no memory usage

37:07.000 --> 37:09.440
when it's just in the background, in general,

37:09.440 --> 37:10.200
were talked about.

37:10.200 --> 37:12.520
Nothing, no work done yet, but they were discussing it.

37:12.520 --> 37:14.520
Overall, it was a nice and productive event,

37:14.520 --> 37:17.600
he writes, with knowledgeable people getting deep

37:17.600 --> 37:19.320
inside the Gnome stack now, trying

37:19.320 --> 37:22.000
to figure out where all the little performance issues are.

37:22.000 --> 37:22.800
That's good.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.360
We had developers from the Ubuntu Desktop team

37:25.360 --> 37:26.880
participating at that event.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.040
Oh, do tell.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.960
Well, that's as much as I know.

37:29.960 --> 37:33.000
The only things I've seen is a photo stream from Marco.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.680
Marco is the same developer that you

37:34.680 --> 37:37.760
saw in Taipei doing the fractional scaling work

37:37.760 --> 37:41.880
last year, and he's been in Cambridge helping

37:41.880 --> 37:44.200
with the Gnome Shell Hackfest.

37:44.200 --> 37:47.640
Going deep, going deep on Gnome performance.

37:47.640 --> 37:51.360
Can I ask, is this work is still valid

37:51.360 --> 37:55.200
if we go Gnome 4 and we retool the way all this stuff works?

37:55.200 --> 37:57.640
Or does this work kind of go out the window?

37:57.640 --> 37:59.920
I shouldn't imagine that any of these developers

37:59.920 --> 38:02.400
are reinvesting time and effort into something that's

38:02.400 --> 38:03.400
disposable.

38:03.400 --> 38:04.680
That's what I would think, too.

38:04.680 --> 38:07.960
It just makes me wonder if it's more of a sign

38:07.960 --> 38:11.120
that we're not fixing Gnome in Gnome 4

38:11.120 --> 38:13.640
and we're keeping things the way they are, or if it

38:13.640 --> 38:15.360
is a sign that this code is going

38:15.360 --> 38:16.960
to be usable in Gnome Shell 4.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.760
I just don't know which one of those two things it is.

38:18.760 --> 38:22.680
Well, didn't they change so that it supports multiple versions?

38:22.680 --> 38:24.960
So it wouldn't matter, as your newer apps

38:24.960 --> 38:27.720
would use the newer version, and the older one

38:27.720 --> 38:28.680
would use the old one.

38:28.680 --> 38:29.680
It's no problem.

38:29.680 --> 38:31.600
I mean, isn't that the reason that they did that effort

38:31.600 --> 38:32.160
before?

38:32.160 --> 38:33.760
I suppose if it's going to be around for a while,

38:33.760 --> 38:35.400
it's good to have it as good as, it's best

38:35.400 --> 38:36.840
to have it as good as possible.

38:36.840 --> 38:39.320
I just like seeing the updates from them, you know?

38:39.320 --> 38:40.840
It's cool to see the insight and see

38:40.840 --> 38:42.080
that they're taking it seriously,

38:42.080 --> 38:43.760
they're concerned about it, and seemingly getting

38:43.760 --> 38:44.800
a lot of good work done.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.760
Yeah, you know, the Gnome project

38:46.760 --> 38:51.280
has gotten a rep for ignoring performance and not listening

38:51.280 --> 38:51.920
to users.

38:51.920 --> 38:54.360
But this week, we've seen this blog post

38:54.360 --> 38:57.000
about a performance hack fest, where

38:57.000 --> 39:00.280
people are making an effort to show up and do work there.

39:00.280 --> 39:03.360
And we saw they rolled back that decision

39:03.360 --> 39:08.320
to remove binary execution from Nautilus, which is a good sign

39:08.320 --> 39:09.280
that they're listening.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.200
People wrote in, they said, here's my use case,

39:11.200 --> 39:13.700
why I need to be able to execute binary files from my file

39:13.700 --> 39:14.480
manager.

39:14.480 --> 39:17.040
And the developers said, OK, all right, well,

39:17.040 --> 39:18.460
we'll punt this decision for now.

39:18.460 --> 39:21.160
We're going to keep talking about it, but we're going to punt.

39:21.160 --> 39:23.440
So that, to me, sort of busts both those myths.

39:23.440 --> 39:26.520
At least it doesn't add a data point to that line.

39:26.520 --> 39:31.080
And on a similar vein, in Joe's new show, Late Night Linux

39:31.080 --> 39:33.280
Extra, that just released its second episode,

39:33.280 --> 39:35.680
he interviewed Jonathan Riddle.

39:35.680 --> 39:40.120
And Jonathan Riddle is a well-spoken member

39:40.120 --> 39:44.400
of the KDE community who I think we should hear more from.

39:44.400 --> 39:46.820
And I'm really glad that he sat down and talked to Joe,

39:46.820 --> 39:49.040
because he busted one of those myths

39:49.040 --> 39:51.800
that KDE is really, really sluggish,

39:51.800 --> 39:53.600
and it's got bad performance.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.880
He busted that myth in that show.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.540
And I think, again, it's one of those things that just

39:57.540 --> 39:59.200
propagates over and over again.

39:59.200 --> 40:03.320
I saw somebody on YouTube installed all of the Ubuntu

40:03.320 --> 40:05.900
1804 flavors, and where possible,

40:05.900 --> 40:09.480
installed the full version and the minimal version,

40:09.480 --> 40:13.040
and then profiled their memory use.

40:13.040 --> 40:17.280
And KDE, or rather, Kubuntu, was among the lowest.

40:17.280 --> 40:19.240
That's quite a bit of work to do, isn't it?

40:19.240 --> 40:20.320
Yeah, and I agree.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.760
In my testing, it was surprisingly fast.

40:22.760 --> 40:24.240
I loaded it on that 10-year machine

40:24.240 --> 40:26.560
for an episode of Last I did a while ago.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.520
And it was the most modern desktop

40:28.520 --> 40:31.680
I could get on there that was really, I guess,

40:31.680 --> 40:34.440
the best way to put it is it just sort of worked.

40:34.440 --> 40:37.440
It just degraded to a point where it was still very usable.

40:37.440 --> 40:38.320
It was very modern.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.480
I didn't really notice that anything wasn't working.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.520
But when you compare it side by side to a brand new machine,

40:42.520 --> 40:44.440
I could see, OK, it's got a little less shiny,

40:44.440 --> 40:45.560
a little less shadows.

40:45.560 --> 40:47.140
But I didn't really have to do much.

40:47.140 --> 40:50.240
It just worked on a 10-year-old system.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.840
And I think the system only had four gigs of RAM,

40:52.840 --> 40:54.080
and it just worked great.

40:54.080 --> 40:54.920
So it gets a bad rap.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.720
Gnome gets a bad rap.

40:56.720 --> 40:57.840
I say, you know what?

40:57.840 --> 41:00.000
Take all of those reputations, all those myths

41:00.000 --> 41:02.720
with a grain of salt, because there's more nuance

41:02.720 --> 41:03.960
to all of these situations.

41:03.960 --> 41:07.400
Still using it three months after the KDE challenge here.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.360
Yeah, good work, sir.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.000
Yeah, yeah, it's going great.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.920
Hey, I'm going to go all the way down to Texas

41:12.920 --> 41:15.720
and put Linux Academy on it for their broadcast system.

41:15.720 --> 41:16.400
I'm so into it.

41:16.400 --> 41:20.280
I really think it's solid, and I've been super happy with it.

41:20.280 --> 41:22.080
And I'm keeping Neon on a couple of systems,

41:22.080 --> 41:24.960
too, because I like the fresh plasma goodness

41:24.960 --> 41:27.840
on a couple of my machines that are really in production.

41:27.840 --> 41:30.440
So one of the machines I'm working today from the RV

41:30.440 --> 41:32.000
is actually a Neon system.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.680
So yeah, I agree.

41:33.680 --> 41:34.480
It's gone really well.

41:34.480 --> 41:37.000
So yeah, I am remote today.

41:37.000 --> 41:37.960
Wes is remote.

41:37.960 --> 41:41.880
Today is like a test episode, where yeah, we're super exciting.

41:41.880 --> 41:44.720
We're getting ready for the big trip.

41:44.720 --> 41:46.600
And so we thought, well, before I actually

41:46.600 --> 41:47.680
am going down the road, we should

41:47.680 --> 41:48.800
make sure everything works, because it's

41:48.800 --> 41:50.840
tricky to route all this audio for the Mumble Room

41:50.840 --> 41:53.240
and Wes and myself and record everything.

41:53.240 --> 41:54.640
So this is a test episode.

41:54.640 --> 41:57.440
That's why it might sound a little different or whatever.

41:57.440 --> 41:59.640
It's not because our editor fell asleep at the wheel.

41:59.640 --> 42:01.680
It's just because we're testing different stuff.

42:01.680 --> 42:03.640
And so far, it's gone pretty well.

42:03.640 --> 42:06.640
And that's why I'm about to talk about Ting,

42:06.640 --> 42:09.560
because this would be the really awkward spot in the show

42:09.560 --> 42:12.600
if I had to say my connectivity was dropping out,

42:12.600 --> 42:14.080
our live stream had been bonkers,

42:14.080 --> 42:15.520
and none of our hosts could hear me.

42:15.520 --> 42:17.760
But fortunately, I don't have to say that.

42:17.760 --> 42:20.800
It's been rock solid, linux.ting.com.

42:20.800 --> 42:23.200
This is how I'm getting down to Texas and staying connected.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.720
And the great part about Ting is they've got two networks.

42:25.720 --> 42:27.200
Right now, I'm on their GSM network.

42:27.200 --> 42:28.500
While I go through the mountains,

42:28.500 --> 42:29.720
I often switch over to CDMA.

42:29.720 --> 42:31.480
Now, I'm not going to lie.

42:31.480 --> 42:33.440
I don't do some sort of fancy switcheroo.

42:33.440 --> 42:34.720
I just have two devices.

42:34.720 --> 42:36.240
It's just the way I prefer to do it.

42:36.240 --> 42:36.880
It's simple.

42:36.880 --> 42:39.200
I just switch Wi-Fi networks on my laptop.

42:39.200 --> 42:41.200
So the GSM device has a Wi-Fi network,

42:41.200 --> 42:44.160
and the CDMA device has a Wi-Fi, because they're little access

42:44.160 --> 42:44.880
points.

42:44.880 --> 42:47.800
And I just, in my desktop or on my laptop,

42:47.800 --> 42:49.800
I just choose whichever one I want to be on that's

42:49.800 --> 42:51.200
going to be stronger in that area.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.120
So a lot of times when I'm in hills and trees,

42:53.120 --> 42:55.320
CDMA is just the better choice.

42:55.320 --> 43:01.320
But if I'm in town or if I'm in a valley, GSM is rock solid.

43:01.320 --> 43:04.240
I'm getting, right now, 9 milliseconds.

43:04.240 --> 43:06.480
Bouncing between 9 and 14 milliseconds on my ping.

43:06.480 --> 43:08.160
I have a little thing in my status bar

43:08.160 --> 43:10.800
that tells me what my ping is, with a 0% packet drop.

43:10.800 --> 43:13.920
And I've got VoIP connections back to the studio, to Wes,

43:13.920 --> 43:14.880
all kinds of things.

43:14.880 --> 43:15.720
And I'm doing it over Ting.

43:15.720 --> 43:17.520
Now, the reason why I tell you all of this

43:17.520 --> 43:20.560
is because this is never how I use Ting, unless I'm traveling.

43:20.560 --> 43:24.480
Otherwise, I just use Ting as like a backup data network.

43:24.480 --> 43:27.720
I use Wi-Fi when I'm at the studio or when I'm at home.

43:27.720 --> 43:30.280
And I download my podcast, and I pin my music there.

43:30.280 --> 43:32.320
And I don't really make any phone calls.

43:32.320 --> 43:33.480
I don't do text messages.

43:33.480 --> 43:34.640
I do telegrams.

43:34.640 --> 43:37.720
And so it's like $23 a month for a phone.

43:37.720 --> 43:39.800
That's usually after your minutes, your messages,

43:39.800 --> 43:40.320
your megabytes.

43:40.320 --> 43:44.240
That's your average, $23 per phone, per month, $6 for the line.

43:44.240 --> 43:46.360
And so for this month, I'm going to use Ting for data.

43:46.360 --> 43:47.560
I'll pay a little more this month.

43:47.560 --> 43:48.480
Next month, I won't.

43:48.480 --> 43:49.440
It's pretty simple.

43:49.440 --> 43:51.400
Also, if you're interested in Ting's fiber internet,

43:51.400 --> 43:52.880
they have a new frequently asked questions

43:52.880 --> 43:53.760
post up on their blog.

43:53.760 --> 43:55.040
Totally worth checking out.

43:55.040 --> 43:57.520
So go check it right now, linux.ting.com.

43:57.520 --> 44:00.840
Take $25 off a device or get $25 in service credit.

44:00.840 --> 44:03.520
That's linux.ting.com.

44:03.520 --> 44:06.640
And thanks to Ting for keeping me on the road.

44:06.640 --> 44:09.240
And see, the nice thing, too, about having those different

44:09.240 --> 44:13.600
Mifis is you can just pay the $6 if you're not really using it.

44:13.600 --> 44:16.080
And I can afford a $6 line.

44:16.080 --> 44:17.200
And it's great.

44:17.200 --> 44:18.200
It's great.

44:18.200 --> 44:19.960
I don't have to fuss with changing things around

44:19.960 --> 44:21.360
or activating or reactivating.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.920
It's always there whenever you need it.

44:22.920 --> 44:23.440
Yeah, right?

44:23.440 --> 44:24.520
$6, that's great.

44:24.520 --> 44:25.960
Exactly.

44:25.960 --> 44:30.560
So Rust is coming to Qt, possibly, to Qt and QML.

44:30.560 --> 44:33.440
There is a new project out there called the Rust Qt Binding

44:33.440 --> 44:34.000
Generator.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.880
That's a pretty clever name.

44:35.880 --> 44:39.360
And it's a generator that helps you quickly use Rust code

44:39.360 --> 44:41.360
in Qt applications.

44:41.360 --> 44:46.720
So you can create a Qt or QML GUI on top of Rust code,

44:46.720 --> 44:51.840
which kind of seems like my peanut butter and my chocolate

44:51.840 --> 44:55.800
are coming together into a delicious technology sandwich.

44:55.800 --> 44:57.400
I love everything about this, Wes.

44:57.400 --> 44:58.160
Yeah, right?

44:58.160 --> 44:59.120
I mean, come on.

44:59.120 --> 45:00.160
Qt, Rust.

45:00.160 --> 45:01.960
Those are your favorite things to hype.

45:01.960 --> 45:04.680
Yeah, exactly.

45:04.680 --> 45:07.880
And they say to combine Qt and Rust,

45:07.880 --> 45:09.720
you write an interface and a JSON file.

45:09.720 --> 45:14.280
From that, the generator creates Qt code from the Rust code.

45:14.280 --> 45:16.080
And then the Qt code can be used directly.

45:16.080 --> 45:17.920
The Rust code has two files, an interface

45:17.920 --> 45:19.440
and an implementation file.

45:19.440 --> 45:20.400
Seems like a mess.

45:20.400 --> 45:22.160
You bastard, I'm excited about this.

45:22.160 --> 45:23.600
See, OK, OK.

45:23.600 --> 45:26.400
There had been plans in the past by Rust community

45:26.400 --> 45:29.360
to make a Rust toolkit.

45:29.360 --> 45:32.920
But they've been talking about it.

45:32.920 --> 45:35.160
It's a lot of work to make a toolkit that is decent,

45:35.160 --> 45:36.320
that people will adopt it.

45:36.320 --> 45:39.440
And it's going to compete with Qt, more fragmentation.

45:39.440 --> 45:41.880
So I find it good that there's efforts

45:41.880 --> 45:45.160
to go and integrate with Qt.

45:45.160 --> 45:48.240
And there's actually already efforts that integrate with GTK.

45:48.240 --> 45:50.480
It actually already worked, was the first one to work,

45:50.480 --> 45:54.080
because Rust works with C and therefore works with GTK.

45:54.080 --> 45:56.000
Everything kind of works with GTK.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.600
That's one thing aside.

45:57.600 --> 46:02.160
But it feels like a mess to have now a process

46:02.160 --> 46:04.680
that you are not really going to be writing Qt,

46:04.680 --> 46:06.960
nor really going to be writing Rust.

46:06.960 --> 46:09.000
So this is like an intermediate step.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.680
And honestly, this is what usually makes

46:12.680 --> 46:14.160
applications kind of crap.

46:14.160 --> 46:15.560
Go to crap directions.

46:15.560 --> 46:18.560
You are going to too many hoops in the between.

46:18.560 --> 46:21.480
And there's no clear, concise way of handling.

46:21.480 --> 46:24.320
They're not doing a proper port of Qt to Rust,

46:24.320 --> 46:28.640
nor making a dynamic system that you bind to Qt objects.

46:28.640 --> 46:31.000
You are now having a generator tool.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.960
How is that any different from what Vala did?

46:32.960 --> 46:34.040
See, I kind of disagree.

46:34.040 --> 46:36.480
Because you're still writing good, genuine Rust.

46:36.480 --> 46:39.800
It's not like it's some sort of weird Qt Rust hybrid.

46:39.800 --> 46:40.520
You'd hope that.

46:40.520 --> 46:43.560
But then if you're really going to be writing genuine Rust,

46:43.560 --> 46:47.480
you will lose the ability to write genuine Qt.

46:47.480 --> 46:48.240
No, no.

46:48.240 --> 46:50.600
See, I think this is cooler than you're giving it credit.

46:50.600 --> 46:53.040
Because this isn't going to be perfect.

46:53.040 --> 46:55.520
But this is an early step to getting

46:55.520 --> 46:57.480
some really solid Qt applications where

46:57.480 --> 47:01.680
you take a core Rust core, their application core of Rust,

47:01.680 --> 47:04.000
and then there is this description JSON file

47:04.000 --> 47:06.960
that the interface, the Qt interface, genuine Qt

47:06.960 --> 47:09.600
is generated from, which isn't really all that different

47:09.600 --> 47:11.840
from how Qt applications are done today.

47:11.840 --> 47:14.160
It's just now making it possible to do it with Rust.

47:14.160 --> 47:16.880
That's how a lot of applications are being done on the Linux

47:16.880 --> 47:17.880
desktop already.

47:17.880 --> 47:19.200
It's just they're not using Rust.

47:19.200 --> 47:20.680
I think that's been proven to work.

47:20.680 --> 47:23.880
I wonder also will that mean, will this build momentum,

47:23.880 --> 47:26.360
even if it's not an ideal interface, will people be like,

47:26.360 --> 47:28.080
oh, yeah, hey, I'm already writing Rust.

47:28.080 --> 47:29.640
I wanted to write a UI.

47:29.640 --> 47:30.920
Turns out Qt's pretty cool.

47:30.920 --> 47:32.280
And maybe that'll be more momentum

47:32.280 --> 47:33.400
to build a better binding.

47:33.400 --> 47:36.360
That's probably more likely what will happen.

47:36.360 --> 47:37.840
Yeah, and Dar, did you want to finish?

47:37.840 --> 47:40.960
Yeah, just the other part that I really see here

47:40.960 --> 47:43.520
is also loses a little bit on the opportunity

47:43.520 --> 47:47.320
to build something that Rust would actually benefit from.

47:47.320 --> 47:48.920
And the principles that we currently

47:48.920 --> 47:51.680
have in Rust, for example, like borrowing.

47:51.680 --> 47:54.240
It's a concept very unique to Rust language,

47:54.240 --> 47:56.120
not quite available in C++.

47:56.120 --> 47:57.720
And you can kind of half-bake it,

47:57.720 --> 47:59.880
but you still have to do the hard work as a developer

47:59.880 --> 48:01.080
yourself.

48:01.080 --> 48:04.040
Those benefits are not going to be necessarily there.

48:04.040 --> 48:06.120
And if the automated tool starts doing it,

48:06.120 --> 48:08.720
it's like code that people can't really inspect very well,

48:08.720 --> 48:10.400
because it's going to be generated code.

48:10.400 --> 48:14.360
And generated code lacks in that transparency aspect.

48:14.360 --> 48:16.800
So I think there is a side effect that

48:16.800 --> 48:20.680
is potentially negative that is often overlooked.

48:20.680 --> 48:21.680
And it doesn't matter.

48:21.680 --> 48:23.560
And yet, Dave, we get good applications, great.

48:23.560 --> 48:24.640
That's awesome.

48:24.640 --> 48:31.040
But I'd prefer to see more genuine attempts

48:31.040 --> 48:33.520
of making Rust Toolkit, even though it's

48:33.520 --> 48:37.080
a harder, longer task, than to just go with that route.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.440
I agree, ultimately, that would be definitely best.

48:39.440 --> 48:41.800
And if you're going to have a really good desktop application

48:41.800 --> 48:43.840
that's really robust, that's probably

48:43.840 --> 48:45.920
the route it would have to go.

48:45.920 --> 48:49.920
So ultimately, I want to get to our thoughts on the best Linux

48:49.920 --> 48:51.520
laptop in 2018.

48:51.520 --> 48:55.040
And I've kind of rounded up the ones that come to my mind.

48:55.040 --> 48:56.280
And they're sort of US-centric.

48:56.280 --> 48:58.880
So I want to eliminate a couple off the list.

48:58.880 --> 49:01.200
I want to get a couple of more on the list,

49:01.200 --> 49:03.160
and also get at least, if nothing else,

49:03.160 --> 49:05.320
honorable mentions of ones outside the US.

49:05.320 --> 49:06.800
So that's where we're going.

49:06.800 --> 49:08.340
We're not quite ready to go there yet,

49:08.340 --> 49:11.560
because I want to close the loop on replacing

49:11.560 --> 49:13.960
Evernote and a Note system.

49:13.960 --> 49:16.400
I've been really, really tempted, because those bastards

49:16.400 --> 49:19.700
over at Canonical just released Tusk as a snap.

49:19.700 --> 49:23.480
I assume it was probably you, Popi, you tempting jerk.

49:23.480 --> 49:24.200
It was upstream.

49:24.200 --> 49:24.800
Oh, really?

49:24.800 --> 49:26.000
We had nothing to do with it.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.320
The upstream developer worked on it, created the snap,

49:28.320 --> 49:29.960
put it in the store, job done.

49:29.960 --> 49:30.920
Yeah, it looks good.

49:30.920 --> 49:34.440
So if you just want to stick with Evernote,

49:34.440 --> 49:38.440
check out Tusk, snap install Tusk, because that looks clean,

49:38.440 --> 49:41.520
and almost made me want to give up on this whole thing I'm

49:41.520 --> 49:42.240
doing.

49:42.240 --> 49:44.000
But I'm trying to get away from Evernote,

49:44.000 --> 49:46.500
because I think that eventually is going to be a dumpster fire.

49:46.500 --> 49:49.800
And I've also just wanted to try to self-host this stuff as much

49:49.800 --> 49:50.600
as I could.

49:50.600 --> 49:52.560
And I mentioned a couple episodes ago

49:52.560 --> 49:56.960
that I've been playing around with Fedora 28 and Nextcloud 13.

49:56.960 --> 50:00.400
And I consolidated my years, and years, and years, and years,

50:00.400 --> 50:03.480
and years of upgrades Fedora box onto this new 28 machine,

50:03.480 --> 50:04.920
moved over the Nextcloud container,

50:04.920 --> 50:06.280
and all that kind of stuff.

50:06.280 --> 50:09.800
And so since I sort of spent the time doing that,

50:09.800 --> 50:11.960
at the same time I installed this app in Nextcloud

50:11.960 --> 50:13.280
called Notes.

50:13.280 --> 50:15.200
And it started just sort of casually.

50:15.200 --> 50:17.600
And then I installed QO Notes on my desktop.

50:17.600 --> 50:20.440
And by last week's episode, I was using QO Notes

50:20.440 --> 50:21.760
and syncing it up to Nextcloud.

50:21.760 --> 50:22.760
And I thought, oh, that's working pretty good.

50:22.760 --> 50:23.120
It's nice.

50:23.120 --> 50:24.400
You know, it just has a little spot in there.

50:24.400 --> 50:26.000
You plug in your server.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.040
It connects, checks to make sure everything is OK.

50:28.040 --> 50:29.480
You're good to go.

50:29.480 --> 50:33.020
And then I started to realize that I'm using this thing

50:33.020 --> 50:34.760
on a daily basis now.

50:34.760 --> 50:36.560
I've completely stopped using Evernote.

50:36.560 --> 50:38.560
And I'm taking lots of notes right now,

50:38.560 --> 50:41.040
because this going down to Linux Academy

50:41.040 --> 50:45.120
to get them to move over to Linux is a hell of a job,

50:45.120 --> 50:45.600
right?

50:45.600 --> 50:48.280
Because it's a project.

50:48.280 --> 50:49.400
It's a full-fledged project.

50:49.400 --> 50:51.880
Because they have all kinds of crazy stuff they do down there.

50:51.880 --> 50:53.020
It's a real production.

50:53.020 --> 50:55.480
And I've got to keep track of the hardware,

50:55.480 --> 50:57.560
all the different hosts, the connections, the types,

50:57.560 --> 50:58.240
like all this stuff.

50:58.240 --> 50:59.840
And I've been using the hell out of QO Notes

50:59.840 --> 51:03.160
to do this, and prepping for the road trip and Texas Linux Fest.

51:03.160 --> 51:05.680
It's been really reliable and handy.

51:05.680 --> 51:07.440
And so I wanted to take it to the next level

51:07.440 --> 51:09.520
and get it across all my devices and see

51:09.520 --> 51:11.920
if that could really do the Evernote replacement.

51:11.920 --> 51:15.280
And I achieved nirvana, note nirvana this week.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.400
And to kind of help maybe get you started,

51:17.400 --> 51:19.880
I'm going to link you in the show notes, linuxunplug.com

51:19.880 --> 51:23.800
slash 250, a guide that was posted by Marco

51:23.800 --> 51:26.480
over on linuxjournal.com.

51:26.480 --> 51:28.240
And it's getting started with Nextcloud,

51:28.240 --> 51:29.200
how and why you should.

51:29.200 --> 51:31.440
And this is the more traditional approach,

51:31.440 --> 51:35.280
actually installing all of the software and the Apache stuff,

51:35.280 --> 51:36.760
configuring my SQL.

51:36.760 --> 51:39.560
I, on my latest go-about, did not do this.

51:39.560 --> 51:40.040
Oh, no?

51:40.040 --> 51:40.880
I'm using a container.

51:40.880 --> 51:41.160
I know.

51:41.160 --> 51:42.080
I thought I looked at you.

51:42.080 --> 51:43.960
I'm, mm-hmm, I did the Docker thing.

51:43.960 --> 51:48.200
But see, Nextcloud makes an official container.

51:48.200 --> 51:50.400
So I kind of feel like that was the way to go.

51:50.400 --> 51:51.480
Yeah, you know that they're updating it.

51:51.480 --> 51:52.160
They're publishing it.

51:52.160 --> 51:52.840
It just works.

51:52.840 --> 51:54.960
You don't have any crazy operational concerns.

51:54.960 --> 51:55.920
Yeah, nice.

51:55.920 --> 51:57.440
Yeah, but I'll link to the guide.

51:57.440 --> 52:00.000
I'll also link to all the stuff I'm about to talk about.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.680
So then I installed the Notes app in Nextcloud 13,

52:02.680 --> 52:04.680
because they have an app marketplace, I guess.

52:04.680 --> 52:05.040
I don't know.

52:05.040 --> 52:05.600
There's nothing.

52:05.600 --> 52:07.080
I don't think there's anything charged in there.

52:07.080 --> 52:08.800
So I installed the Notes app, which is just

52:08.800 --> 52:10.680
a basic markdown notes.

52:10.680 --> 52:12.080
And whatever you create in here, it

52:12.080 --> 52:14.120
saves it to a Notes folder in Nextcloud,

52:14.120 --> 52:16.120
which then, if you install the Nextcloud client,

52:16.120 --> 52:18.680
syncs that folder down to your desktop.

52:18.680 --> 52:21.120
And everything in there is just plain text markdown.

52:21.120 --> 52:24.880
And that's also the same directory

52:24.880 --> 52:26.880
that qownotes looks at.

52:26.880 --> 52:29.080
So then I installed qownotes, which

52:29.080 --> 52:31.600
is a cute note-taking application that, again, uses

52:31.600 --> 52:36.240
markdown and has full support for own cloud and Nextcloud.

52:36.240 --> 52:38.600
And it has a dark theme, which I happen to like.

52:38.600 --> 52:40.520
It previews markdown.

52:40.520 --> 52:43.080
And Wimpy, I know that you are also a qownotes user,

52:43.080 --> 52:44.600
because I think you mentioned that in a recent Ubuntu

52:44.600 --> 52:45.360
podcast.

52:45.360 --> 52:45.760
Yeah.

52:45.760 --> 52:47.960
Yeah, I've been using that since that

52:47.960 --> 52:50.400
was the snap that brought my awareness of the project

52:50.400 --> 52:50.900
around.

52:50.900 --> 52:53.160
And I've been using it ever since.

52:53.160 --> 52:54.120
I really love it.

52:54.120 --> 52:55.640
Are you doing any kind of syncing,

52:55.640 --> 52:58.440
or are you just using it on a local file system?

52:58.440 --> 52:59.480
Kind of both.

52:59.480 --> 53:02.760
So the way I've set it up is to store its data

53:02.760 --> 53:05.280
in a prescribed directory.

53:05.280 --> 53:09.840
But that directory happens to be a directory that I sync.

53:09.840 --> 53:12.360
So I get syncing via other means.

53:12.360 --> 53:16.640
So it hasn't got the native Nextcloud integrated.

53:16.640 --> 53:20.160
But I was just able to place the data in a location

53:20.160 --> 53:22.000
where I already sync the stuff.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.520
Yeah, and that works perfectly fine.

53:23.520 --> 53:26.640
I think off the top of my head, you don't really lose much

53:26.640 --> 53:30.520
other than if I click the Share button in qownotes,

53:30.520 --> 53:34.480
it actually generates a Nextcloud preview URL

53:34.480 --> 53:36.760
that renders the markdown to HTML,

53:36.760 --> 53:38.720
and then it hosts it on the Nextcloud server,

53:38.720 --> 53:39.640
which is kind of cool.

53:39.640 --> 53:40.880
Then you can give somebody a URL,

53:40.880 --> 53:42.040
and they can look at your notes.

53:42.040 --> 53:42.560
Oh, wow.

53:42.560 --> 53:42.920
I didn't realize they did that.

53:42.920 --> 53:44.520
Just by clicking a button in qownotes.

53:44.520 --> 53:44.880
Yeah.

53:44.880 --> 53:45.440
That's pretty cool.

53:45.440 --> 53:47.040
Yeah, it's nice.

53:47.040 --> 53:48.320
So I was playing around with that.

53:48.320 --> 53:51.560
I prepped this whole show in qownotes this week,

53:51.560 --> 53:53.320
and I loved it.

53:53.320 --> 53:55.580
And so the only other piece I wanted,

53:55.580 --> 53:57.160
because the other thing I was using qownotes for

53:57.160 --> 53:59.440
is I'm taking notes for a bunch of stuff with our mixer,

53:59.440 --> 54:01.280
trying to keep track of some different things.

54:01.280 --> 54:02.920
And I wanted to be able to read them off from my phone

54:02.920 --> 54:05.760
while I'm actually standing over the mixer working on it.

54:05.760 --> 54:07.480
So I had to get those notes down on my phone.

54:07.480 --> 54:10.080
And that's where Cloud Notes, now there's plenty of solutions

54:10.080 --> 54:13.560
for Android, including, of course, for both platforms,

54:13.560 --> 54:15.720
just the Nextcloud app would be able to just browse

54:15.720 --> 54:18.560
the directory structure and view the files, right?

54:18.560 --> 54:20.760
But I wanted something that was specifically

54:20.760 --> 54:23.520
designed to take notes, supported markdown,

54:23.520 --> 54:27.320
supported doing lists and things of that nature.

54:27.320 --> 54:29.720
And that's where Cloud Notes, which specifically positions

54:29.720 --> 54:31.920
itself as an own cloud client, but it works just fine

54:31.920 --> 54:35.680
with Nextcloud, it's $1.99 in the iOS app store.

54:35.680 --> 54:39.320
And it's not perfect, but it does native connections

54:39.320 --> 54:42.160
to Nextcloud or own cloud, supports SSL,

54:42.160 --> 54:44.240
and it syncs all of the changes back and forth.

54:44.240 --> 54:47.520
It'll render the markdown, and it lets you share the notes.

54:47.520 --> 54:51.720
It's not a perfect note client, but it does put my notes now

54:51.720 --> 54:53.960
on my desktop, my laptop, my phone,

54:53.960 --> 54:55.600
and on the Nextcloud web, and it's

54:55.600 --> 54:58.320
marked down across all of them if I want to.

54:58.320 --> 55:00.840
And they all support, they all render it,

55:00.840 --> 55:03.320
they all do highlighting, syntax highlighting.

55:03.320 --> 55:05.840
And that happens to just be my preferred way to write notes.

55:05.840 --> 55:08.640
Anyways, I've done that since I was an IT contractor.

55:08.640 --> 55:11.040
It's pretty great.

55:11.040 --> 55:12.560
I'm just closing the loop on this topic.

55:12.560 --> 55:13.960
I won't spend a lot of time on it,

55:13.960 --> 55:18.040
but it really does feel like a solid, self-hosted, secure

55:18.040 --> 55:18.600
solutions.

55:18.600 --> 55:20.960
Everything's SSL.

55:20.960 --> 55:25.280
QownNotes has AES-256 encryption by default,

55:25.280 --> 55:27.360
but this is pretty cool.

55:27.360 --> 55:32.120
It has a plug-in to use Keybase as a key to actually do,

55:32.120 --> 55:35.880
yeah, to do GNU PG encryption of all of your notes

55:35.880 --> 55:37.600
signed to your Keybase profile.

55:37.600 --> 55:38.760
That is slick.

55:38.760 --> 55:39.920
Yeah.

55:39.920 --> 55:41.840
So there's a couple other really cool plug-ins

55:41.840 --> 55:43.920
that it supports in there, including swapping up

55:43.920 --> 55:46.360
the markdown engine and all kinds of stuff.

55:46.360 --> 55:48.800
QownNotes is, I really think it's

55:48.800 --> 55:51.280
an underrated application for the Linux desktop.

55:51.280 --> 55:52.480
It has so many uses.

55:52.480 --> 55:55.640
Even if you don't want to ever use any kind of sync system,

55:55.640 --> 55:58.360
you just want to have files on your local hard disk

55:58.360 --> 56:01.800
or on a thumb drive or whatever, it would do great at that.

56:01.800 --> 56:04.320
Is there anything you haven't been able to get quite right

56:04.320 --> 56:05.320
yet?

56:05.320 --> 56:10.480
Yeah, but Google Photos, I think, could fill in the gap.

56:10.480 --> 56:13.920
But the thing that Evernote is great at and kind of had

56:13.920 --> 56:16.280
kept me around is when I travel, I

56:16.280 --> 56:17.880
could take pictures of business signs,

56:17.880 --> 56:19.600
and it OCRs text in the photos.

56:19.600 --> 56:20.960
That is nice.

56:20.960 --> 56:23.120
Yeah, and it's got support for business cards and stuff

56:23.120 --> 56:24.240
like that.

56:24.240 --> 56:26.360
But I've got other apps on my phone

56:26.360 --> 56:29.760
now, like ScanBot, that can do that kind of stuff.

56:29.760 --> 56:31.200
So it's not as necessary.

56:31.200 --> 56:33.960
When I first had that functionality in Evernote,

56:33.960 --> 56:37.640
it was the only app that really did that.

56:37.640 --> 56:41.400
But now I could use ScanBot to take a photo of a sign

56:41.400 --> 56:43.920
and let Google Photos sync it up, and I could search it.

56:43.920 --> 56:46.120
I haven't actually done that yet because I'm still

56:46.120 --> 56:48.200
on the fence about going back to Google Photos.

56:48.200 --> 56:50.680
But it would be an alternative.

56:50.680 --> 56:52.360
Right, you have some options now.

56:52.360 --> 56:53.520
Yeah, yeah.

56:53.520 --> 56:56.080
I'd love to know if anybody else has any solutions.

56:56.080 --> 56:58.120
I don't know how to replace that functionality.

56:58.120 --> 56:59.800
I do miss that the most.

56:59.800 --> 57:01.520
I don't know if Tusk even supports that,

57:01.520 --> 57:03.440
because it's a search thing, so it might.

57:03.440 --> 57:05.400
And the Evernote client is just really heavy,

57:05.400 --> 57:08.520
so I really kind of liked having a clean, fresh start, too.

57:08.520 --> 57:10.920
And I'd love to know your solutions for how

57:10.920 --> 57:13.720
you're doing all of this and what your thoughts are

57:13.720 --> 57:14.280
on notes.

57:14.280 --> 57:17.160
Like, I'm trying to use this system for notes

57:17.160 --> 57:21.720
on mechanical information about my RV, everything from types

57:21.720 --> 57:24.920
of oil to part numbers.

57:24.920 --> 57:28.040
I'm trying to keep track of how our mixer is configured.

57:28.040 --> 57:29.920
There's a wide range of stuff I'm trying

57:29.920 --> 57:31.480
to use a note system for, so I need

57:31.480 --> 57:32.880
to be able to categorize it a little bit.

57:32.880 --> 57:34.760
I need it to be across all the devices.

57:34.760 --> 57:37.000
I want it to be secure, and I'd rather it not

57:37.000 --> 57:38.800
be on a hosted service.

57:38.800 --> 57:40.340
I mean, I'm paying for the droplet,

57:40.340 --> 57:42.260
but I'd rather it not be on a hosted service.

57:42.260 --> 57:44.080
I'd rather it be on something I control.

57:44.080 --> 57:46.520
And now I'm making backups of that Nextcloud instance,

57:46.520 --> 57:49.040
plus I have it in plain text on all of my hard drives.

57:49.040 --> 57:50.660
It feels like a pretty solid solution,

57:50.660 --> 57:52.960
but I'd like to know what other people are doing.

57:52.960 --> 57:56.000
You can send in a contact note at linuxunplugged.com

57:56.000 --> 57:57.920
slash contact.

57:57.920 --> 57:59.960
All right, well then, let's get to the laptop stuff.

57:59.960 --> 58:01.620
So first, let's talk about DigitalOcean.

58:01.620 --> 58:06.080
Go to do.co slash unplugged to get a $100 credit

58:06.080 --> 58:10.160
at DigitalOcean do.co slash unplugged for 60 days.

58:10.160 --> 58:11.640
If you sign up with a new account,

58:11.640 --> 58:15.240
you'll get $100 in DigitalOcean service credits.

58:15.240 --> 58:17.400
Now, my favorite rig is $0.03 an hour,

58:17.400 --> 58:19.120
so that's going to get you quite a while

58:19.120 --> 58:20.720
on their super fast infrastructure.

58:20.720 --> 58:24.200
Everything is using SSDs, from the $0.03 an hour

58:24.200 --> 58:27.880
to the ones that have huge amounts of memory and CPU

58:27.880 --> 58:29.680
and disk, it's all SSD.

58:29.680 --> 58:31.880
When you attach block storage, it's SSDs.

58:31.880 --> 58:34.200
It's fast, plus 40 gigabit connections

58:34.200 --> 58:35.720
coming into the hypervisor.

58:35.720 --> 58:37.800
And then they've strategically placed data centers

58:37.800 --> 58:40.600
all around the world, so it has great connectivity

58:40.600 --> 58:41.760
to those regions.

58:41.760 --> 58:44.680
Plus, when you combine that with their predictable cost

58:44.680 --> 58:46.960
and billing, the different optimized compute types,

58:46.960 --> 58:48.560
including their new flexible droplets

58:48.560 --> 58:50.560
where you can mix and match resources,

58:50.560 --> 58:52.520
it's really hard to beat DigitalOcean.

58:52.520 --> 58:54.480
And then they have services built in,

58:54.480 --> 58:57.880
like Cloud Firewalls, monitoring and alerting,

58:57.880 --> 59:02.520
easy to manage DNS, and of course, that API.

59:02.520 --> 59:04.840
That API and that dashboard really bring it all together.

59:04.840 --> 59:07.400
They're easy to use, like the API is super clear,

59:07.400 --> 59:09.040
it's easy to read, and there's lots

59:09.040 --> 59:10.920
of open source applications already built

59:10.920 --> 59:12.600
that you can just start using today.

59:12.600 --> 59:14.480
You can just start taking advantage of them.

59:14.480 --> 59:16.080
Plus, they have fantastic uptime.

59:16.080 --> 59:18.920
My next cloud instance that I've been using this whole week,

59:18.920 --> 59:20.720
of course, that's up on DigitalOcean.

59:20.720 --> 59:22.560
I put it in the San Francisco region.

59:22.560 --> 59:25.920
I am predominantly on the West Coast of the United States.

59:25.920 --> 59:29.200
And not always now, but almost always.

59:29.200 --> 59:31.000
And so that made sense for me.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.380
But I could move it around, I could

59:32.380 --> 59:34.240
have set up a separate one somewhere else.

59:34.240 --> 59:35.960
I like that functionality.

59:35.960 --> 59:38.240
And they have such great pricing.

59:38.240 --> 59:39.680
$0.03 an hour for my favorite one.

59:39.680 --> 59:41.160
It's just, it's crazy.

59:41.160 --> 59:42.880
So go take advantage of that $100 credit,

59:42.880 --> 59:44.320
go build something great.

59:44.320 --> 59:47.280
Go play around with an entire stack of open source software,

59:47.280 --> 59:49.280
or build something from the ground up.

59:49.280 --> 59:52.120
dio.co slash unplugged.

59:52.120 --> 59:56.680
Big thank you to DigitalOcean, that's dio.co slash unplugged.

59:56.680 --> 59:59.840
Going to have a straw poll linked in the show notes

59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.760
on the best Linux laptop for 2018.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:04.000
I'm going to drop it in the chat room too right now.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.440
I know not everything's on there,

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.200
so here's the way this is going to work.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.640
I would like you to go vote on this,

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.640
because whatever gets the least amount of votes

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.320
gets eliminated off this list, and we'll

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.480
put something else on there.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.080
But right now, these are the laptops

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.520
that seem the most appealing to me.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.480
And I'll bust through them really quick,

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.600
and then we'll talk about each one of them individually.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.600
Again, I acknowledge there's some missing,

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.800
like all of the Intraware products, for example,

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.240
are not on this list.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.600
But here is the top ones that I have so far.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:36.040
The ThinkPad X270, the Aurex Pro newly updated,

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:40.320
the XPS 13 Developer Edition, ThinkPad X1 Carbon,

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:43.520
and the Librem 15 are sort of my top choices

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:47.000
right now for a 2018 Linux laptop.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.560
And each one has pros and cons, and the ones

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:53.520
I probably know the least about are the Lenovo ThinkPads.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:57.280
But from what I've heard about NOA's 270, which isn't even

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.680
the current model anymore, it seems

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.500
like a pretty compelling device.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.680
You're probably a resident ThinkPad expert,

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:06.120
Popi, do you know the difference between the 280 and the 270

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.960
and why NOA says the 270 is the one you want to get?

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.360
Not really.

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:13.560
My most current laptop is a 250.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.800
I generally go for the one that's a year older,

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.600
just because it's cheaper.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.160
And I can get it second hand.

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.000
You get a half price than the one that's brand new.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.360
Yeah, I know that the one big difference

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.640
is a crazy proprietary ethernet dongle port on the 280.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.760
They've dropped ethernet.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.060
That's a shame, that's been one of their selling points.

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:36.440
But the reason the 270 is high on my list

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:40.400
is having watched the way NOA works with his,

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.280
it has incredible battery life.

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.480
It really is an all day battery.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.880
And it's got a three cell battery integrated into it.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.000
They don't call it a battery, but it's got a three cell

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.880
battery, a power station I think is what they call it,

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:52.680
integrated.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:55.760
And then he's got a nine cell battery hanging off the back.

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.040
And the cool thing about that integrated battery

01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.760
is he can hot swap batteries.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.720
He can just rip the battery off and slap a new one in.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.280
And that three cell internal keeps it going for a while.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.640
Yeah, I do that with my T450.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.800
It's a fantastic feature.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.120
I have three spare batteries for my T450.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.480
So if I want to, I can go all day and beyond

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.860
and just swap out while I'm running.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.520
And it just keeps on running on the internal

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.440
while you swap it out.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.760
It's great.

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:25.280
Like I don't need that all the time.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.400
But when I need it, I super need it.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.600
So on this trip to Texas, I am the whole way down there.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.280
We are running off of batteries.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.680
And when we drive, we charge the batteries.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.800
And when we park, we drain the batteries.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:40.160
And it's going to be 100 degrees in some areas.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:43.320
So the fridge will be sucking batteries down like crazy.

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.620
So if my laptop can avoid being plugged in,

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:47.440
because the double damage with my laptop

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:51.480
is it's converting DC to AC back to DC.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.140
It's just this brutal process where

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:57.380
if I can avoid doing that when I'm running off of batteries

01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:59.120
and I can just go off of the laptop battery,

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.760
that would be very, very beneficial.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.440
And that kind of kicked this whole thing off.

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.280
No, it gets like 12, 14 hours.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.120
What kind of battery life do you get, Popi?

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.640
Probably not as much as that.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:12.280
But then I'm doing quite brutal things, lots of compiling,

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:16.220
lots of VMs, electron apps, all the kind of things

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:19.080
that you probably don't want to run if you want that.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.760
Now, Wes, you have been shopping for a laptop.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.040
You've got the original Sputnik Developer Edition.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.720
And you were just looking at the X1 Carbon,

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.680
which is the second ThinkPad on this list.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.840
Yeah, it is really handsome.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.480
I just happened to be in a store the other day,

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:37.120
and there was the XPS 13 right next to an X1 Carbon.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:37.960
Oh, really?

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:38.880
Boy, they're both handsome.

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.160
I love how light the XPS is.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.200
It's just light and thin and feels super minimal.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.480
The Carbon, though, does have a certain,

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.020
it still has that ThinkPad style feel.

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:50.040
It feels a little more rugged.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.320
It feels sort of like you could really throw it in a bag

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.720
and just not worry about it.

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.320
Yeah, the XPS is a little delicate.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.240
Now, I have the fifth generation.

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.400
I'm actually talking to you through my old XPS right now.

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.480
That's the last laptop I have right now.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.680
And I broke it.

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:08.800
And so the side, it squishes when I pick it up.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:13.080
It's starting to fall apart a little bit on me.

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:16.400
So over the three years I've had it,

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.880
it's maybe not held up quite as well as I wanted.

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.080
But it's still fully functional, and I'm still

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:23.440
using it as a full-fledged production machine.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:27.640
So it's just maybe the build quality

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.440
could have been a little bit better.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:32.640
And I would bet you it has improved since then.

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:35.720
When I was at scale, I saw quite a bit of the X1 Carbon

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:36.680
floating around.

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:37.920
Seemed to be a popular one.

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.160
Seemed like it was fine running Linux.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.120
You do lose that ethernet port again, though,

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.320
which that's a bit of a deal breaker for me.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:45.920
I really want an ethernet port.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:49.280
What's most important to you, the portability of the device

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:52.560
or the size and comfort of the screen?

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:55.200
Do you mind about how heavy it is?

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.480
Not a lot.

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:58.720
The screen is probably slightly more important,

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.640
and a good keyboard is pretty important.

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.640
I don't want it much bigger than the XPS 13,

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.720
so somewhere around 13 inches, I think,

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.120
is kind of what I'm looking at.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.640
So you're not going to be video editing on this thing, then?

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.880
No, no, I don't plan to.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:14.720
No, it's more for web, email, and audio.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.920
Right, OK.

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.200
You have something in mind?

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.280
Well, I was just wanting to clarify.

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.880
There's no point in me going into it

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.840
if you know what your use case is.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:29.720
But as an owner of two XPS 13s and having also

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:33.880
reviewed their current model, they're really solid devices.

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:37.800
Yeah, I am predisposed to be inclined to go with the XPS 13

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:41.640
because it's got a really solid accessory market, too,

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.520
like Docs and USB-C hubs and things

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.080
like that that are really reliable,

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.480
and that's attractive to it.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.880
Another advantage is that it doesn't matter

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:50.480
what Linux you put on it.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:53.960
You'll be able to update the firmware via Linux

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.760
with the XPS 13.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.480
Also, the new Hades Canyon NUC also

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.120
has its firmware in LVFS, so I discovered at the weekend.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.360
Oh, really?

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:08.760
A little side tangent, how is the Hades Canyon NUC going?

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.560
That is going to be many weeks of hard work

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:16.360
to get Linux working well on it is the TLDR there.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:19.920
Yeah, it's all in flight at the moment.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:23.880
So the GPU is not supported in current kernels.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.520
It's scheduled for inclusion in 4.18.

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:30.120
So it's building kernels from Git with DRM next branches

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:30.760
and stuff.

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:34.560
Yeah, I think the XPS 13 is my strongest lead right now.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:37.940
The Lenovo only pulls ahead because of that power station

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:40.000
feature where I could swap batteries.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.280
And the 270 has ethernet, which the XPS does not.

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.040
And it has USB-C charging.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.040
But you raised a good question, like the screen.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.160
Well, what if I wanted to go with a slightly larger screen?

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.880
Because if it's going to be my main system for production

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.520
while I'm on the road.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:58.880
Then the Librem 15 or the Oryx Pro, I think,

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.320
become pretty solid contenders.

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:06.480
I have the Librem 15 and the One Rev behind that they sent to me.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.480
And I think it's a really good system.

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.600
I'm not a huge fan of the screen, but other than that,

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:13.040
I think it's a great system with a good keyboard.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.560
And then System76 just updated the Oryx Pro.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.720
And it looks pretty nice.

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:22.240
It's got 8th Gen i7 CPUs, up to 32 gigs of RAM.

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.480
And it's a lot thinner.

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:27.600
It's way thinner with a GTX 10 in it.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:31.280
The only complaint I have with it is the battery, I think,

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.880
is like around somewhere in the 50 watt range.

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:39.640
And that's not so bad on a XPS 13.

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.480
But on an Oryx Pro slightly larger,

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.400
when I'm trying to optimize for battery life,

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.440
that's sort of not the right use case for me.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.400
If I could be plugged in most of the time,

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.480
I think it would actually be a good system for me.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.360
But the battery life is a killer.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:54.680
And I can't seem to find one that

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:56.320
beats that ThinkPad for battery.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.560
So this is where I kind of punt to the audience a little bit.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.640
I'd like to know what they think, linuxunplug.com

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:01.800
slash contact.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.400
And we also have that poll in the show notes.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.640
I wonder if anybody's voting.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.960
Because what I was thinking was, is obviously,

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.280
this is not an inclusive poll.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.320
So if we can pull a couple of these off the list right now,

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:15.240
the ThinkPad X270 and the Librem 15

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.920
are trailing behind the most.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.240
And the XPS 13 is pulling ahead, which

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:21.560
is the live voting that we have with the live audience.

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.280
So I'll link that in the show notes.

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:25.440
I'd like to have the rest of the download audience

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.160
vote on that a bit, or at least those of you that are willing,

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:30.320
just so we can kind of get a sense of which laptop

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:32.080
we should remove from that list, and then

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.680
let us know on the contact page which laptop we should add.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:36.600
Wes and I are not necessarily either one of us

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.400
buying a laptop today.

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:39.520
But Wes, you've got to be getting close, right?

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.400
Yeah, I think it now is the summer.

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.560
I've got some traveling coming up.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.880
But then after that, I think it will really, really be time.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.120
Striking distance for you.

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.240
Yeah, and that'll be nice.

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:51.320
That way, when you launch Slack, your little fan

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.040
doesn't have to spin up every time.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:52.680
Yeah, exactly.

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:53.800
That'd be good.

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.120
I can run two Electron apps.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:55.600
Oh, my.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.100
Yeah.

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:56.600
Yeah.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.440
Yeah.

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:01.600
I know this Chrome app that we're using to talk right now

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:05.080
really spins my CPUs up pretty bad on this XPS 13.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.440
That's what's pegging it.

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:09.960
Not all the other stuff I'm doing, but that Chrome app.

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.760
Yeah, so check out that poll.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.880
Go vote and let us know what you think.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:16.800
Mumble room, any other thoughts on laptops or hardware

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:19.160
before we wrap this sucker up?

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.480
The Galago Pro gets a mention.

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.400
Yeah, somebody in the chat room is saying,

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:23.040
mention the Galago Pro.

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:26.240
Yeah, I don't think, again, that comes back

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.680
to the battery and the fan stuff with the Galago Pro

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:31.120
are not going to make an optimal for my use case.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.120
The Dell XPS 15 is getting a mention.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:36.040
The Latitude E6440.

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.000
OK, those are good mentions from the chat room, too.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.400
Ones with two 9-cell batteries?

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:40.900
Oh.

01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:41.680
Dang, that is great.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.400
Yeah, I'm kind of curious if there's these sleeper hits

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:44.760
that we've just been missing that turned out

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:47.320
to be a really reliable Linux laptop that no one's ever

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.920
heard of because it's an Acer or something.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:53.360
Speaking of Jonathan Riddle, he did a pretty hard sell

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:54.280
for the Pine Book.

01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:56.400
And it kind of made me really interested.

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.120
You can only get them in limited quantities

01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.300
because they don't build them until there's

01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:00.400
enough of an order.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:04.400
But the Pine Book sounded pretty cool, like $100 somewhere

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.920
around there for a ARM laptop that's

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:09.360
actually decent performance.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.000
I got to be honest, that piqued my interest.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.280
That piqued my interest.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.760
All right, well, go check out more Popeye and Wimpy

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.640
over at the excellent Ubuntu podcast, which

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:22.080
is coming right along and always a great listen.

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.120
Just caught the latest episode the other day

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.580
and thought it was quite enjoyable.

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:27.680
Good work, gentlemen, as always on the podcast.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.080
I recommend people go check it out.

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:31.200
Thank you very much.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:34.880
And Mr. Wes and I do a full breakdown

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:40.280
of the big bad new version, the new variant of, what was it,

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.440
the store bypass variant.

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:42.520
Of course, I'm totally blanking out now

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.040
because I didn't plan to mention this.

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.240
Spectre v4.

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.320
Yeah, Spectre v4.

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.200
We do a full breakdown on this week's episode of Tech Snap.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.000
Wes did an excellent job of digging

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.340
through some of the documentation

01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:56.360
that Red Hat released, which was really good stuff.

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.960
And we have a digest of all of that and more things you need

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:02.320
to know in this week's episode of Tech Snap.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:05.160
So check that out at techsnap.systems.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.760
Now, this show continues on as we go down the road.

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.680
I don't know exactly how or when.

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:11.760
But it will.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.600
But it will.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:13.640
It will.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:17.200
linuxunplug.com slash subscribe.

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:20.080
Just get it every single week whenever it does come out.

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.100
And we will attempt to stream it live.

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:25.720
You can find that at jbliv.tv.

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.120
And you can find the live times at jupyterbroadcasting.com

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.180
slash calendar.

01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:31.400
Links to everything we talked about at linuxunplug.com

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.000
slash 250.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.120
How's about that for a whole bunch of Earls?

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:37.200
How about one more for the Texas shirt?

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.440
teespring.com slash jbtexas.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:40.800
Go get some swag.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:12:06.120
And we'll see you next week.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:09.360
All right, we got a title, jbtitles.com.

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.000
Oh, Hadidah's getting home.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.840
Hadidah has arrived home just as we finished.

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:14.880
Perfect timing.

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:18.880
jbtitles, jbjbtitles.

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.120
All right, we'll see what we get.

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.920
It's nice to have JBot back.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.200
See if it'll load, though.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.000
jbtitles.com.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.840
How did it feel doing it from home, Wes?

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:27.560
Not too bad.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.280
A little bit different.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.160
I miss your smile and face, of course.

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.080
But hey, workable.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.400
Oh, you're such a gentleman.

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.080
You're such a gentleman.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.080
No, I mean, it was kind of nice to be

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.960
able to take a breather between techsnap and live.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.800
That was kind of fun.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.560
Levi enjoyed the sunshine.

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:42.600
So that was good.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.560
My air conditioning kicked on midway through the show

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:48.640
because it started to get really, really hot in here.

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:50.480
How come JB Titles isn't loading, Wes?

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.000
Uh-oh.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:52.520
Yeah.

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:53.120
Yeah.

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:53.840
It's no good.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.160
It's no good.

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.800
How are we ever going to title it?

01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.400
You know, we also didn't title TechSnap.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:00.800
This is a double title jam up.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.120
What's happening with us?

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.080
Oh, man.

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:05.000
Mamba Room, thanks, guys.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.280
You guys were great, as always.

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.360
Hello, darling.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:08.840
Hello.

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:09.400
Welcome home.

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.360
Did you bring home beer?

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:12.440
I brought home beer for me and cider for you.

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:12.960
Thank you.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.160
Cider for me and beer for her.

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.320
I was just thinking, I can't believe we did the show

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.760
and I don't have any booze in the show.

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:20.200
Like, I don't have to drive anywhere.

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.120
I'm at home.

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:38.240
I could have had a brewski.
