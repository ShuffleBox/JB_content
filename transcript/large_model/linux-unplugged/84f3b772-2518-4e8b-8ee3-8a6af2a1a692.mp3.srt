1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
What was that really easy clustering that was originally just on live CD? What was that called? There was a super dead simple

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,680
Clustering software for Linux for a while. There was only like in the two kernel two dot something kernel maybe and

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,240
You know you booted off a Debian live CD

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,120
you have a master controller and then you'd boot up all the other ones and say that they we should look for the master and

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,080
Then you could you could distribute tasks between all of them like the like they had a floating

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,080
Process table, I can't remember

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,840
Wonder what it was called. It was the coolest way to do clustered stuff, and it was so straight called heartbeat. No

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,080
It's not around anymore, so it's gonna be hard to find because it relied on stuff

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,880
That was like I think sunset a long time ago in the kernel

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,760
So it's probably gonna it's probably impossible to find it now. It's I'm so old

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,780
That's that's the problem well the reason I said yes at heartbeats because that articles from 2002

12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,440
That's almost old enough. It's not a bailiff cluster

13
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,720
Nice tech man yeah, that would play rust that would play rust tech man that would definitely play was it mozziex

14
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,660
Was it open mozziex was that it I?

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,520
Think I just I think I just found it

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:26,400
Open mozziex. Yeah, and cluster not picks. That's the live CD thing I was talking about so this was originally for from mozziex in

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:33,060
2002 open mozziex was stable on Linux kernel 2.4.x for the x86 architecture

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,520
But porting it to the 2.6 kernel remained in the alpha stage and support for 64-bit

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,400
architecture only stayed in the 2.6 version on

20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,240
July 15 2007 it was announced the open mozziex project would each it would reach end of life

21
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,880
Due to decreasing need for SSI clustering and low-cost multi-core processors becoming more available

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,480
but so this was particularly useful for running parallel applications, so this is another great way to build or

23
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,080
It would actually worked really well is if I had centralized storage I

24
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,600
had a couple of users that would just slam a samba server and

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,340
I could actually move that process around to a system that wasn't as busy. It was really cool

26
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:18,620
And you could just when you needed a system. You would just add it to the cluster by booting off of clustering optics

27
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,380
It would detect the cluster, and it would just get added as resources and when you were done

28
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,900
You would reboot it so at night. I could go reboot a whole bunch of systems into this

29
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:33,260
Gosh, this is so cool. Oh, man. It was clustering optics. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Well. It is a gen 2 derivative. I

30
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,460
I

31
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,460
Really had fun with that stuff

32
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,980
It'd be really cool to set that up again sometime. Yeah, that does sound fun kernel 2.6

33
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,940
No and 2.4 my time 2.4 if you want the good stuff

34
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,320
That's what an optics in that. This is what the KDE desktop look like back in the day look at that

35
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,420
That KDE one or two. I don't know I don't remember, but I do remember that digital clock

36
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,200
I had all of my KD desktop set to use that digital clock

37
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,360
You know this clock did you the one thing I'll say about this version of KD is this panel was rock-solid

38
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,480
I have my panel crash on plasma sometimes now and this panel never crashed like that

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,320
It's probably all just one process or something but

40
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,080
Boy that was a totally different time. Yeah, right. That's funny to think about last version was September 1st 2004

41
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,320
It is possible that you might be able to do it on modern kernels because apparently

42
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:40,320
OpenMozics was forked in their Linux PMI and is currently developed. Hmm OpenMozics auto-discovery new nodes automatically join the cluster cluster management tools OpenMozics user land and OpenMozics every node has root access to every other node via SSH

43
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,960
Yeah, that was the other thing I loved about is they just talked SSH

44
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,040
MFS DFS a to support every node can have a full-blown X or console only for more memory

45
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
So what is would you say is still in development?

46
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,480
Linux PMI, I think but Linux PMI, huh? Sounds like something else the website might

47
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,840
Yeah, Katie, too. Yeah, I think so a project with a lot of potential 2009. Yeah

48
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,840
a lot of potential

49
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,400
This is Linux unplugged episode 200 and 22 for November 7th

50
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:26,400
2017

51
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,320
Oh, welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that survived Chris's new rust obsession, and I'm that Chris. Hello

52
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,520
My name is Wes, you know, you know beard

53
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,320
I kind of blame you because you kind of got me into rust so the beards here too, but you know

54
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,400
I'm not here next week. You can blame him. Oh, I gotta fill in for me. Okay, I'll be here. Anyway

55
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,880
All right. Yeah, I think he's playing rust over there right now in the corner despite that

56
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,640
We still managed to put together a pretty good show this week

57
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,680
It's it's gonna be packed with a lot of community news and a story too

58
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,160
We got a little anecdote that we that I think resulted in a pretty good app pick this week

59
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,480
Desktop environment. We don't often talk about very much and then Starcraft 2 for Linux

60
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,760
well

61
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,760
Well, we'll explain what's going on there

62
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,880
Dan's here from elementary OS tells what's going on with granite

63
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,680
Which I think is one of the coolest things about elementary OS and maybe you'll find out why and then

64
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:28,120
There's a spat herd around the community right now, and there's a lot of crazy speculation. Everybody's got conspiracy theories

65
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,640
I'm gonna give you a breakdown of

66
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,280
What's going on between the software Freedom Law Center and the software Freedom Law Center?

67
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,440
And the software Freedom Conservancy a hype free conspiracy free

68
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,640
Concise breakdown of what's going on and the projects will be impacted by this dispute

69
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,440
Why we actually care the actual open source projects the code that you and I all use on our day-to-day

70
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,120
Adventures what's actually getting screwed over by all this shenanigans. We'll get into that and then to make everybody feel better

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,720
We're gonna wrap it up with one badass-looking command-line utility that helps you straighten out

72
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:12,760
You stress the heck out of your Linux box and then visualizes the whole thing for you on the terminal so whoa yeah

73
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,720
I really like this tool

74
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,440
So we'll talk about that to kind of pick up the mood before we get out of here

75
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:24,380
But you know if if there was ever morale officers to be had it's those in our virtual lug time appropriate greetings mumble room

76
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,200
Hello

77
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,660
We will do our best to be guiding you through those morals. Oh, thanks morale's not morals

78
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,540
I

79
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:39,340
Thought you said more we'll take both actually no morals. You know what that's true. That's very true. I'll take that

80
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,880
I'll take it you guys can help us with both. That's probably very useful

81
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,540
So let's get into some interesting news

82
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:51,580
Just to sort of loosen us up a little bit because there could be ups and downs in this episode dramatic moments things that no one

83
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,580
saw coming

84
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,060
But in the meantime let's talk about Gladys a

85
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,140
Raspberry Pi powered intelligent open-source home

86
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,940
assistant

87
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,500
Yeah, okay, so Gladys is new

88
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,300
It's designed from the ground up to act as a central hub that interacts with a variety of smart

89
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:18,940
IOT that's Internet of Things devices. I know I'm sorry smart speakers other devices light bulbs

90
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,100
But it has a couple other tricks that a lot of your average assistants don't

91
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,620
and Gladys or Gladys can communicate with low-cost

92
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,220
433 megahertz door magnetic contacts and wireless motion sensors through RF

93
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,220
430

94
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,220
433 megahertz transmitters which and receivers which I was just thinking I believe that's the stuff that Noah really likes to oh

95
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,580
That's the stuff. He likes to install

96
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:50,420
and of course as all the other kind of fancy things and they have a they have a demo video where someone has a Bluetooth a

97
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,500
Bluetooth low-energy switch and they're able to activate a light and music scene by

98
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:00,860
Pressing that switch and then talks to the Raspberry Pi 3 and it implements their commands and you can see they do have a GUI

99
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,860
That's nice. It's definitely

100
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:10,060
For geeks because you put in your for your home for your parameters your home your address your city your postcode your longitude your latitude

101
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:15,780
You know those guys things that all average a home user setting up today's IOT devices have off the top of their head

102
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,700
I keep them just on my tattoo right here. Yeah, of course you do. Of course you do and they've got bots

103
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,380
that's the one thing I do like if you don't want to do anything else, you can just text it like a like a

104
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,100
Text message and Gladys bot will respond to it. I know you're pretty hyped about this, right?

105
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,100
We call you're probably gonna be deploying this. Oh, yeah, totally

106
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,580
100% definitely

107
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,500
Okay, all right, well I wanted to start with something weird but apparently nobody gives a shit about it

108
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,860
That's right. I mean you didn't bring no on the show. He'd love it

109
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,500
Yeah, maybe cuz it's talking his 433 megahertz RF. Well, and it's self-hosted

110
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,460
Yeah, Dan you play with any of these like like I got a couple of echoes you play with any of these kinds of things

111
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,480
I need like smart switches and stuff, but you know, not really just cuz I'm in an apartment

112
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,880
So there's not much modding that I feel comfortable doing here

113
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,060
Yeah, I think I think the smart switches are a good way to sort of dip your toe in there

114
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,160
It's useful for me in the winter when it's cold. I know I'm an old man, but I have my heaters on it

115
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,140
It's nice. It is nice. I think for this we just really have to see you know, duh

116
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,940
Is there any adoption or there are people doing novel things with it that are passionate about it until then?

117
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:26,460
Yeah, one of the the interesting things about this is you can expand it to add additional protocols by adding like the Z wave USB dong

118
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,700
Yeah, yeah

119
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,060
Yeah, this is I sort of put this actually in here a secret

120
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:36,340
I secretly put in here to just sort of test to see what the interest was because I'm thinking people are burning out pretty bad

121
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,540
On these is what my sense is and so I wanted to see how that would play out. I I

122
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,180
Think it is kind of the case. I think it is kind of me

123
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,020
I think it's but I what's interesting is I think it does have some mainstream broader appeal

124
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,060
Yeah, I think so

125
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,620
But also probably comes and goes and waves to you, you know people buy a bunch of it

126
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,700
They have it that you guys do it and then it's like you're done spending your money for a bit

127
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:01,020
You're done spending your money and like only so many new types of interactions come online and you know the certain rate

128
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,480
So at some point you're like, well, I turn all my lights and my heaters off and now the other thing is

129
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,700
Maybe the people that are buying this are doing it to make stuff easier

130
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,940
and so you go with the tools like your echoes and

131
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:17,300
Your home assistants and your hues and stuff like that that are all really easy to use because that's why you got it in the first

132
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,100
place

133
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,700
Right and geeks are like we want full-fledged solutions. And so it's not a real appealing market to us. Yeah

134
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,340
Have that said I find it to be a nice I find it to be and it is actually

135
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:35,660
How did I say that one of the reasons I've stuck with it more than more of the automation is because it's had a high

136
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,740
Degree of family appeal spousal approvals and children like my kids like they all get it

137
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,300
They all know how to use it and it works well with that for them

138
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,940
Which is one of the reasons why it's stuck

139
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:52,820
So, okay, maybe something more toward niche then what do you think about this guy's signal is now available as a standalone desktop app

140
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:59,820
It's an electron app, but but you can get on your your Linux or your your Mac's or your Windows now all of them

141
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,360
Yeah, and the setup process is kind of interesting. So you download it that gets their shipping as a deb right now

142
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,780
And you can't do jack with it until you have it set up on your mobile device, too

143
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,900
And then once you have signal configured on your mobile device

144
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,060
There's a process and signal where you add a new device and you scan a QR code and you just tell this app

145
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,940
Okay, I've set it up on my mobile device. I'm ready now. So it displays the QR code

146
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,220
You scan that with your phone and it links them up. It's pretty similar to telegram then

147
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:32,420
Well, no, no, so well, I mean in that it's useless until you set it up in your mobile device. Yes. Yeah

148
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,220
But what's different than telegram is it syncs all of your messages in your contacts?

149
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,340
From the other device not from the server

150
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,740
So once it's once you've paired them it then does this moment where it says alright, hold on there boss

151
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,460
I got to pull down all your contacts and all your messages and sync it to sync these two things up

152
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,640
Let me ping your device and so instead of having all this stuff sitting on telegram servers

153
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,640
It just blasts down to a new telegram install

154
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:01,740
This stuff has to sync between your your own encrypted device and before they do that they each set up a key

155
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,260
Yeah

156
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,020
They have a little they have a little chitchat back and forth to negotiate and then they and then they do the sync

157
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,300
so that was interesting but

158
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,060
You know, you're not gonna have your I

159
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,940
Ironically, I'd say it's not even nearly as doesn't feel nearly as integrated even as telegram does which is like some QT app that uses

160
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:25,740
Their own thing their own black magic. I'm disappointed that they don't have a snap and only sports distros that use apps. That's what they say

161
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,660
Yeah, Linux distribution supporting app like Ubuntu or Debian. Yeah, I bet you send a you are already actually

162
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,520
What do you guys think don't bother them about it when you install it on arch anybody the moment room a signal user

163
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:43,740
Are we all just a bunch of telegram bitches now? Everybody just all telegram. Yeah, we are we look at the telegram

164
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,380
No, buddy signal you do. Yeah, I do occasionally do

165
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,860
All right import your app MMS messages into it and actually have it as your default

166
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,960
Texting app on your phone so you can use it as your messenger

167
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:03,340
You can only you know, you can enable extra features for signal protocol to work its magic

168
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:10,580
But yeah, it's just a texting app. I just checked there are six different signal a you are Wow

169
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:16,060
Oh, so that's why do you use signal say over telegram is a different contacts you separating them out is a different features

170
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,660
You know, I don't use it a ton. I have a way more people on telegram

171
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,180
So I do use telegram as like day-to-day, but I have a couple people on signal and you know

172
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,500
I do I do have more trust for it and it's I do

173
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:33,080
So when I do have conversations, I'd like to keep private. That's my choice now heavens

174
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,340
Do you also have any other ones that you could compare it to are you just a signal user?

175
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,060
I've used telegram too, but not as much

176
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,680
Telegram is more of an app and signal is more of a replacement text messenger

177
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:52,800
Okay, fair enough. That's how I would compare it really they both have the same encryption features where you can enable

178
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,320
you know one-to-one communication, but

179
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,860
signal actually replaces the MMS app which or where a telegram is just a

180
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,780
third party

181
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,420
Program just another app on the phone. Yeah. Yeah, it really is

182
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,420
So in that context the signal would be more equivalent to hangouts, which you can do the same thing. Mm-hmm

183
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:19,220
I wish I bet you don't get that that integration on on the Apple iOS on that

184
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,780
Stone isn't even it's not even

185
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:27,340
That comparable either because hangouts doesn't exactly replace your MMS app even though it can

186
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,900
but it doesn't have

187
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,740
integrated encryption into it at least with a protocol which is

188
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,740
Vetted

189
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,780
It looks like a pretty nice app and they're steadily adding features

190
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,580
They just recently the beginning of October started beta testing read receipts

191
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:50,260
which is something that can be nice for some folks and then at the end of October you we got the desktop app and

192
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,580
Now they're working on expanding things like doing gif searches to include in text

193
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,980
You know the jiffy kind of stuff that people love all that kind of stuff

194
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:03,380
So they're they're slowly just checking off features that a lot of other systems have but what did impress me about it

195
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:08,000
Was I really felt it felt it felt more secure than telegram

196
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,060
It felt like it didn't feel like Vladimir Putin was reading my messages

197
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,660
Yeah, right when tell it every time I'm using telegram I go

198
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,940
Yeah, yeah Putin could read this one and this doesn't seem that exciting but the you know

199
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,840
The Chrome app version of it

200
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,960
I think that was off-putting to a lot of people and so having like real first-class

201
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,460
As long as you're willing to consider like John real but regardless having first-class desktop support

202
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,740
I think makes it a lot easier for me to make this the case to others that hey you should jump on here

203
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,740
so man speaking of

204
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:41,380
Crossover and Chrome. I mean speaking of Chrome Crossover has a Chrome OS version now Crossover office

205
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,180
Folks that always hacking away at wine and then yeah

206
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:50,480
They make their commercial their commercial version that I've I've almost bought every single version of now because they just think it's it's a nice

207
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,020
Way to manage your wine

208
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:56,220
Installs if nothing else and there's been other things that come along like gaming on Linux and other things

209
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,700
But nothing's nothing's nearly as good as crossover and now they're talking about a version for

210
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,100
Chromebooks

211
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,840
This is gonna be huge potentially if it if it even half works

212
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:11,420
They have a video should we risk it you want to do a little hope how to install

213
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,220
Oh, this is how you install crossover. I do like the music

214
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,820
Stage one had this music. We would be there. Oh

215
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,260
Yeah, we got it. We'll figure that out

216
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,140
You think we'd have do you think we could figure that out by the end of the show no no no if we're gonna do

217
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:30,380
The whole VM thing yeah, okay, but next time yeah, so anyways stay tuned for news on that because it's been announced

218
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,600
It's there. They have a beta right now. That's good. So does that change things for you?

219
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:41,260
No, make a Chromebook anymore if you know it, but it does it does probably make it more appealing for a lot of people

220
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,060
You know how we used to speculate is the Windows subsystem for Linux gonna keep some people on Windows

221
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,140
I know for a fact now it has I've heard from several Windows users who are considering switching

222
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:54,580
Yeah, and they were considering switching to Linux, and they're like I don't need to know I mean it does make sense

223
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,300
Right if you're just a casual. You don't really care you haven't bought into the whole

224
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,940
Open-source free software thing you don't use it you haven't so this realized what if this is that move

225
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,180
What if this is that move on Chrome OS? Yeah?

226
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:11,900
Maybe that means only the true Linux users will remain kind of see the writing on the wall for that like a mile away

227
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,900
You know

228
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,380
You know you I'm saying yeah, yeah, it's probably only gonna

229
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,360
I bet you only works on certain Chromebooks, so so you got it okay here you go

230
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:27,920
Here's the requirements has to be a Chromebook with an Intel processor. Oh you have to have Google Play services available and enabled for it

231
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,040
So that probably means a Chromebook that can run Android apps, right?

232
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,080
That might be how they're doing this

233
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,400
And then 200 megabytes of free disk space and 2 gigs of RAM and if you got if your Chromebook meets those

234
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,560
Requirements then you could potentially run Windows applications on your Chromebook

235
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,080
So speaking of messaging applications does anybody care that Skype has

236
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,360
made

237
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,920
Made that Skype for Linux version that new crazy Skype desktop version

238
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,160
That's now officially the main Skype desktop version

239
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,800
Oh yeah for Mac for Windows 10 real official Windows 8 Windows 7 and Linux are all now switching over to that

240
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,960
Electron version of Skype the one that we've been beta testing in the studio and

241
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,440
Sorry to report guys that the

242
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,920
Feature that I know you all wanted really badly in your Skype. It's been delayed on the desktop version

243
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,680
I hate to break it to you, but snapchat style stories

244
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:28,600
Didn't make it to the desktop version of sky. I know I know I know you wanted to have snapchat like stories in your Skype

245
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,920
I really did

246
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Did they manage to port ads?

247
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,840
They did. I think they did manage. Yeah, they didn't have reliability

248
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,160
They hate that

249
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,120
Microsoft declined to say how many total active Skype users they have today so TechCrunch speculates

250
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,120
That means it's probably still around 300 million

251
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,780
But the company did give some details Microsoft said that Skype now has surpassed a billion downloads on Android

252
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,820
Geez generated 2 trillion minutes of video calls since 2006

253
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:06,860
I think half of those are text naps and today's users make up to 3 billion minutes of calls per day

254
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,640
3 billion you can multiply anything by the number of users you have it sounds pretty good

255
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,960
It's funny how how much more

256
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:24,080
This new version looks like and has the features of discord and slack. Yeah and slack there and they've been doing bots

257
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,580
They're doing bots too. They're really trying to everybody's trying to be so they've got their reactions

258
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,240
Everybody's trying to be slack and it's so annoying

259
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,480
Can't slack just be slack

260
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,780
Like like at least when matrix did it they did something unique there, you know

261
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,080
But like Skype if you go look at this

262
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,640
We'll have a link in the show notes you look at the screenshot in that article. It's what you would almost think

263
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,160
It's slack at first. Maybe someone wrote how to write an electron app. That's like scat slack and then

264
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
Everyone else is just like, all right, this is easy

265
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,280
Everybody's just looking at the source code to the slack app and going, you know, this is great about electron apps

266
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,280
It's all just right here. Let's just take it

267
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,000
I don't like the problem is that a lot of times people look at and they go oh, you know

268
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,080
This is the leading solution. Let's compete with that

269
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,460
And instead of looking at this is the problem that they tried to solve and that's how they came up with a new competitive

270
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,020
Product. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you know what? I'd like here's how I'd like the Skype folks to think about it

271
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:20,580
Why do people want to use Skype over slack for video and audio calls and whatever reasons those are?

272
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,160
let's get really even better at those get even better because

273
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,740
slack is adding pretty decent web RTC video calling and

274
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,120
I if I if I wanted to just use slack with that had video calling I would just use slack and

275
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,960
So Skype needs to ask the questions to themselves

276
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,320
Why would somebody still choose to use Skype over slack now that it has those features and double down on that stuff?

277
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,560
they're just making they're just watering down their feature set and

278
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,520
Unfortunately, and I hate to be this guy so typical of me

279
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,040
Really just so disappointed in myself even but we all are don't worry

280
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,880
And you will you will you you have to back me up on this because you witnessed it firsthand

281
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:02,440
We have legitimately had considerably better audio and video performance under the old Windows version than we have

282
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,880
With the new Skype beta. Yeah, that's true

283
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,360
it pains me to say it but you are right like we tried for weeks to get video working properly in a way that didn't

284
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,320
Suck on tech snap and and then we eventually just for on a whim like well

285
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,240
Let's reboot into Windows 7 use the old version of Skype. See what happens and it was bulletproof

286
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,760
Ever since and it sounds better too. And that's really that that just pisses me off now. I wonder now

287
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,480
I don't I wonder which version Dan was using like I wonder if it's any better if it's the modern electron on both ends

288
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,600
Yeah

289
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,320
Probably I do find you to be better

290
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,060
So on Koda radio if both my Mike and I are on the electron version

291
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,080
It's better and if he's on like a non electron version

292
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,200
I have to reboot into an OS that has that okay version interesting and then it sounds better. It works better

293
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,080
The two do not still I don't think work as well together and I'm just you know

294
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,080
Just listening to with my ears recording these shows

295
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,800
I maybe other people getting different results, but for the my is my broadcaster bad ears of yours

296
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Well, like a kid screaming them a lot. So they're not as good as I used to be

297
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:05,880
All right. Let's talk about a desktop environment that doesn't get as somebody put it enough love on this show recently and that's enlightenment

298
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,160
Enlightenment has a brand new release 22. How about that?

299
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,640
Did you even know did you even know after one year and 1500 patches?

300
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,680
200 tickets on their issue tracker and a whole bunch of new features. We get a little 22 and one of the headline features is

301
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,440
greatly improved Whalen support

302
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:33,320
Adding support for all kinds of stuff including some of the pointer stuff that was really broken and improved support for ex Wayland as well

303
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,720
Which is enlightenment was one of the first desktops to actually implement Wayland protocol support because of their compositor

304
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:49,000
Design they had I imagine that they had to have as well update their protocol support

305
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,720
In order to get up-to-date, but they were one of the first yep

306
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,800
Yep, they they definitely were and they just had they just had to get they had to get caught up essentially

307
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,000
They've made some improvements to how their windows tile and they have per window now pulse

308
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,620
Right there in these so you have your title bar where you have your application icon you have in the middle of the window

309
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:16,160
You have the name of the app and then you have your window controls like your maximize your minimize in your clothes on the far

310
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,420
Right, but on the far left next to like the icon

311
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,220
they put volume control for that specific application if

312
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:29,460
That's not if that's not the most brilliant thing. I've ever seen it brings it to me

313
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,840
I'm saying saying enlightenment 22. That's what's going on the studio machine

314
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,660
Systems reloading all these systems. It does actually make me want to try it next to go

315
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,740
I don't know if it would work an X to go but it if it if it did it would that would be pretty great

316
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,300
They've also worked. I remember their gadgets were really cool

317
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,580
they've been that they've improved the gadget infrastructure as they put it and

318
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:56,380
They've also created a improved GUI for like pseudo prompts and SSH password prompts. That's nice

319
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,740
Obviously, I'm not it. I'm not a daily user. So I can't speak authoritatively on it. But I

320
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,500
Mean, I'm a little enlightenment curious. Yeah, I am as well. Maybe I can install it on gentoo later

321
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,980
Yeah, if you ever get that gentoo working West, I'm sorry

322
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:18,060
Just one job. Just one. You know what West just just know it

323
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:23,940
No, it couldn't have said it better myself. No, okay. The FL is way faster to compile than the no more

324
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,860
Yeah, no kidding that actually be a shortcut when you get to that stage you should do that yeah, why not

325
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,700
Yeah, all right. Well, let's let's keep going here

326
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,580
I got a I got an app pick as it were based off of a little support call

327
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,900
I wound up in before the show so I thought why not share it with the whole class

328
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:48,820
You're so generous speaking of class Linux Academy comm slash unplugged go there and sign up for a free seven-day trial

329
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:54,180
It's a platform to learn all about Linux really any DevOps topic and then any of those huge platforms

330
00:24:54,540 --> 00:25:00,140
Around Linux like like OpenStack or or AWS or Azure. There's just a big OpenStack summit and

331
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,420
Lots of news I almost put some of it in the show

332
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,300
But I figure if people are open stack curious

333
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:14,020
They could just go to Linux Academy Linux Academy comm slash unplugged you support the show you sign up for a free seven-day trial

They have a great system with hands-on scenario based labs. They have instructors real humans that can help you

335
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,060
They have a course scheduler when you're busy

336

learning paths with your series of courses and content planned by instructors and

337
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:33,540
Then they have a community that's full of your fellow Jupiter broadcasting listeners because they've been a sponsor for quite a while Linux Academy

Comm slash unplugged. It's a great platform. That's always getting better. They're always adding new value adding new content

339
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:46,020
Fixing up and improving and going back and rephrasing and based on feedback or addending things based on new commands. It's

340
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:52,100
It's a great system Linux Academy comm slash unplugged go there sign up free seven-day trial

Enjoy the offline content you can download and take some study guides with you and Android and iOS apps to listen and study on-the-go

343
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:05,980
an audio that you can kind of take in like an audiobook it's pretty nice system Linux Academy comm slash

344
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:10,260
Unplugged you might say they paint a great picture in your mind

345
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,120
I do and speaking of painting a great picture the lady

346
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:20,380
My lady my lady friend came to me last night and said I tasked one of my employees

347
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:26,100
Her name is Christina with setting up an image editor on our front front workstation

348
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:32,300
Okay. Now Christina is a lifelong Windows user and the front workstation is an Ubuntu 1604

349
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,900
system with unity 7 on it and

350
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,860
I

351
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,060
Immediately my heart sunk because I'm like, oh god

352
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,020
how could this have possibly gone because what is she gonna do first she's gonna go to Google and

353
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,060
Best case scenario and no disrespect to the game project

354
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:53,900
But best case scenario is she somehow after all of her research online because this guy loves to research. She's very diligent

355
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,500
Mmm, she winds up at GIMP somehow figures out how to get GIMP installed on the Ubuntu box

356
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,660
And then they go to just they want to create some signage because they haven't marked they have a marketing thing coming up and they need

357
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,180
Some digital billboards. They just need to mock together some signs for it to show the artists what they want

358
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:12,340
That's all they're looking for. And so if they can they can paint would do the job, right? And of course as

359
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:18,300
Luck would have it they wound up at GIMP and they got GIMP installed to their credit which good work

360
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,420
I wish I could have had like a camera on that to see how all that went down

361
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:27,740
They got like a Linux badge. They can give them just like a good job. You've installed GIMP. That's a rite of passage

362
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,660
I actually was very impressed. So they got that installed and then they opened it and

363
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,980
That's where it didn't work out. I'm like whoa, and it's funny

364
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,260
You know what?

365
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:43,380
Their first reaction was and it was so classic it couldn't have been more classic because I had no influence on the conversation

366
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
Well, this is nothing like Photoshop

367
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,920
Oh, oh my god, damn it. Damn it. I'm like, come on. Come on. Okay

368
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
Well, have you heard of GIMP shop?

369
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,620
So I yeah skin. Yeah. Yeah, I I thought about it

370
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,720
I did but you know

371
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,600
there's another app I've mentioned it once before on the air and I think was years ago and

372
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,600
Linux action show and it's just such a great basic app and it's it's it's pinta

373
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,560
P I N T a and it's painting made simple and they have a PPA available for Ubuntu

374
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,280
So at first I had to try to install it through the software center

375
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,000
But it wasn't working for so, you know, you know what?

376
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,040
You know what is always the easiest is just give people commands have them open the terminal

377
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,840
It's just it's it's it's binary they type it in and it either works or it doesn't work and there's no like

378
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,840
What are you seeing on your screen?

379
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,200
Where is that button that like it's just describe where the menu and right did the prompt come back or did the prompt not come?

380
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,720
Back, that's all I have to know and so I I was able to with three commands

381
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,840
She got the PPA set up

382
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,520
We got a repos update and then she got it installed and they're up and working with with Pinta P I N T a

383
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:54,360
It's a free open source program for drawing and image editing and it's it's just powerful enough

384
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,280
It's more powerful. It's more like a paint net if you ever use paint on windows

385
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:04,880
I used to use that and it's more like paint net. It's got layer support. It's got histories. It's got tabs

386
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,120
It's got lots of basic image editing

387
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,680
and

388
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,640
It's just it's just really doesn't come with the cute dog picture because I don't think so

389
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:19,640
If you're looking for something simple as well, I'd also give a shout out to my paint. Yeah. Yes

390
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:24,520
My paints also really good, right? That was the other one that I had. I knew there was another one

391
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,080
I was forgetting my paint is also what I like

392
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,280
So my paint org is where you can find that one

393
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,240
And then yeah gimp shop as heaven mentioned is if you just want to use gimp

394
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,120
But just have the arranged in a way that makes it look more like Photoshop, which is something I've enjoyed

395
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,960
Because I had used Photoshop previously because my mom was a graphic artist

396
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,720
And so she's been using Photoshop literally since version 1 and so it was always in our household

397
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,280
Yeah, so I grew up with from version 1 and then I stopped using Photoshop

398
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,240
heavily around

399
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,440
7

400
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,040
But I still use it on and off frequently

401
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,520
With our JB has a creative cloud subscription and I still find it to be a better layout than GIMP

402
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,120
I probably you know, I'm probably equal in my usage there

403
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,200
And so if I could just make gimp look more like Photoshop, I think I'm gonna do it again

404
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,440
I think I'm gonna try to gimp shop it up again. I used to do it

405
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,560
I think I'm gonna do it again and I'm on unity. I'm gonna gimp shop it up. I'm going all in

406
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Because a lot of people that know Photoshop know that Photoshop has plenty of obscure features that but they would probably never know

407
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:29,360
For years unless they were an expert and so they expect new features to pop up and gimp shop does give them that

408
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,360
experience of

409
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,200
discovery

410
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,200
And if you want something else that's advanced, that's not the GIMP then

411
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,400
There's also Krita. Yeah, which I think is maybe more for drawing but yeah

412
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,600
Yeah, I know that Albert likes create a lot

413
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:52,080
So there there's a lot of there's a lot of hubbub today about this Starcraft that came out for Linux Starcraft 2

414
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,040
Give me started on it. Yeah, it's just a headless thing

415
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,280
it's a headless thing, but it kind of it might be a cool way to run like

416
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:07,680
The Starcraft server remotely on a Linux box somewhere. Is that what I'm getting here? Well, that's I'm aware of it's the protocols

417
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,840
so as long as the protocols are

418
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,360
Network capable. Yeah, and not just

419
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:20,200
Local network capable then you should be able to run a Starcraft client on a remote server and have it

420
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:28,320
Relay all of the commands back and just play locally. He's so yeah, I'm pretty excited digital open digital

421
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Yeah, right, right

422
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:36,040
Now we just need somebody to write an open source front end right to talk to that. I know

423
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:41,740
Yeah, can you play Starcraft 2 on Linux? I've never tried so don't know and under whiny. Oh you can

424
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,780
You can hashtag rust life. I

425
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,020
Don't know. All's I know is rust. I've been every free minute. I log into rest

426
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,860
There's a Starcraft 2 arch wiki entry. So that says something I'll save it for user

427
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:58,940
We're gonna have to talk about rust on user this week because I had such a hoot with wimpy and poppy last week

428
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:04,020
They got me they sucked me in and I came in at the right time and it's been a blast

429
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:09,740
So check out this the checkout user later this week for the I gotta I gotta start also poppy if you're listening to this

430
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,740
I think you might be a psychopath. Sorry

431
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,180
All right, moving on. We got a question that came

432
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,180
Oh

433
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:24,860
We go back for just a second sure sure I'm looking at the the downloads for the Starcraft 2. Yeah. Yeah, it's password

434
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,980
It's in a password protected file and the password is I agree to the EULA. Yeah

435
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:37,260
Yeah, I looked around too for licensing stuff and it was pretty I don't know people are pretty jacked up about it

436
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:42,540
I look down again. Okay, looks like under wine. It's platinum though. It is a parody good. Oh, it's the game is yeah

437
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,140
Oh, it is apparently under the AI and machine learning license

438
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:53,420
Well, I know where all my hard work hard-earned money is going which is a blizzard specific license

439
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,340
I tell you okay

440
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,980
I'll tell you if you boy if you want to if you want to try out a few life theories like

441
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,380
Should I have been a member of the collective should I've gone out on my own?

442
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,340
Could I live after the collapse? You should play rust Eric. It's a it's a good

443
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,840
It's just a good mental exercise and just try out a few different life scenarios

444
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,840
All right, so we got a question that came into the show and maybe Dan might help us with this one because I bet he

445
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:20,200
Has thoughts and I bet so he says guys what distro should I be using to get high DPI support on my laptop?

446
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:25,880
I recently bought a Dell XPS 15 and I've been having a hard time finding a distribution

447
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,280
That doesn't look like crap on my high DPI display

448
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,960
anything running XFC

449
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,600
Not that

450
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
What do you think though Dan because I know

451
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:41,440
High DPI is something that the elementary project has some opinions on and I

452
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:48,000
Recall one of my first out-of-the-box high DPI just working by default distros was elementary OS

453
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,280
So I'm gonna put that down for you as a recommendation

454
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,400
But high DPI thoughts in general is there things to look out for or things he can look for

455
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,080
yeah, I mean high DPI is pretty complicated right now actually and

456
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,640
I think the first big question to ask is are you gonna be using this with an external display is

457
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,040
If you are then you definitely want a distro that's running Wayland

458
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,120
Is mixing DPI's is not something that X does well

459
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:20,760
Definitely that is you'll get the weakest link in the chain basically on that external monitor and it's a bummer

460
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,920
Yeah, yeah, then the next question after that is

461
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,360
What scaling does your display attempt to do normally because Windows does?

462
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:37,880
of non integer scaling and so a lot of these manufacturers are putting out displays that are built for non integer scaling whereas

463
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,500
Most high DPI ready desktop environments in the Linux space right now only handle integer scaling

464
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,320
Wow, I barely even understand is that right the fractional scaling. Yeah, that's yeah

465
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,200
Yeah

466
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,700
So so if your display is looking for like a 1.25 or 1.5 scale

467
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,720
Like you're gonna have a pretty pretty bad time, right?

468
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,520
And unless like unity has some stuff for that like the latest gnome added some stuff for that

469
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:10,240
But that's still like you still probably want to be on Wayland for that and you're talking like the really latest version of gnome

470
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,880
Yeah, so if you get past those two things and you're like, oh

471
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,160
I'm only gonna do integer scaling on my laptop and I'm not gonna attach to an external display

472
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,720
Then you can pretty much go with anything. That's ggk3. Yeah

473
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:29,160
I have I will say I have pretty good success with elementary OS and I have great success with unity 7

474
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,320
You have to go manually do it in unity 7 like an animal

475
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,140
I have to squinted my screen and I that's where you have the magnifying glass in your in your desk drawer

476
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,360
Right for that

477
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:43,480
But the nice thing is you just hit the super key you type in display enter and then it's to the only slider on that

478
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,340
window is the one you need to move and you just slide it up to like a 2 in my case and

479
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:52,100
Mm-hmm looking good and I bet that's the case for the XPS 15 too. I bet it just be a 2

480
00:35:53,060 --> 00:36:00,880
Remember for them they have to remember that it's the disc or desktop environment that does the DPI scaling not the distro, right?

481
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,080
Right. Yeah, that's important. Yes. Yes. Yeah, the question to what did say distro didn't it?

482
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:10,700
So you could yeah you yeah, you really need to focus more on the desktop environment. So the latest gnomes

483
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,460
plasma can do this to

484
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,460
an elementary

485
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,660
And and you know, I'm gonna be that guy miss a unity 7-2. Mm-hmm

486
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,940
Yeah, definitely unity 7 you got to kind of stick to that stuff for right now

487
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:27,060
And if anybody has any other tips, please leave a comment. Let us know

488
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:33,660
So Dan the real the really tough stuff about that though is you're gonna run into like apps like Steam that don't scale

489
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:39,820
Oh, you're like OBS or like a lot of the really important apps that you're gonna want don't support. I'd be I yet

490
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,300
Yeah, you know surprisingly my daily driver at home

491
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:48,540
I've wound up on a high DPI display and not didn't even really just that's the laptop I ended up taking home for a bit

492
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,500
and

493
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,960
That's really where it stands out the most is Steam

494
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:57,380
otherwise, it's pretty good like my day-to-day apps that I use Chrome and Firefox and the terminal and

495
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,800
My editors they all look really good now

496
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:07,180
so it's it's those things like Steam or it's old X applications that

497
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:13,660
Like an old Java app or something that just look like real hell. Yeah, or sometimes like some proprietary stuff

498
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,500
Like that the Dropbox UI doesn't look quite right

499
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,580
But it essentially looks right and telegram has support

500
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:24,700
You can go in there and you can tell telegram to zoom its UI up a little bit and then it looks then telegram looks

501
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,740
fine, too

502
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:30,900
So good luck. So Dan why we're chatting. Why don't we talk a little bit about the new release of granite and

503
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:37,460
And what's new there and and maybe I know we've talked before maybe even on this show about it

504
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,460
Maybe not but kind of like a quick recap of what the heck granite even is

505
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,380
Yeah, so if you're not familiar with what granite is

506
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:52,300
basically, we we had this problem when we started out where we're making a lot of apps with not a lot of people and

507
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,100
Realizing that we had a lot of common design patterns that we were spending a lot of time

508
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:05,300
Rewriting over and over and over again, so we made this library on granite and it's a companion library for GTK plus and GLI and

509
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:11,620
Granite basically is just a way for us to not repeat ourselves. It contains like common

510
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
utilities and widgets and

511
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:19,260
Design patterns that we've used all in our different apps that you can use in your apps, too

512
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,260
And it makes it really easy to write nice

513
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:29,900
elementary HIG compliant apps very quickly and so this has got a I got to imagine helped with the app store

514
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:36,020
Adoption that we talked app centered adoption. We talked about last week over 50 native applications

515
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,240
I mean a lot of them are maybe all of them using granite to get set up. I

516
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,360
Don't know if all of them are but but I'm sure like a fair number more

517
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,720
I don't have that stat actually handy, but I can tell you that we're over 60 apps now

518
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,720
Hey

519
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,400
Thanks, I think this is I think the reason why I've always praised this is because it's a

520
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,600
It's the easy button for developers. Yeah, it's it just it does a lot of the hard work that they don't really want to do

521
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,360
Yeah, okay

522
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,920
Maybe I could learn how to do this right and the thing is is like it takes care of UI

523
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:12,920
Elements that you don't have to worry about and by using these it looks consistent and well integrated with the rest of the entire

524
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,840
Operating system and so it looks like it's part of an ecosystem

525
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:22,100
So I really I really think that every distribution should have this I think

526
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,580
Canonical would have had this with unity 8 once they were done

527
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I think Gnome

528
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,500
Started to go in this direction with gnome builder. They started down this path, but there's all there's there's so much work to be done

529
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,720
here and

530
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:41,800
Now we have an iterate another it of release. It's a 0.5 release of granite. What's what's new?

531
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,740
What's what do you what lessons have you guys learned recently? That's been sort of integrated into this release

532
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:49,560
So there's a there's a couple big things in this release. One of them was

533
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,880
Not only what's new but what we got rid of

534
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:57,580
There's a ton of stuff that we built out in granite that is now

535
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:05,300
Available in GTK or has become features of GTK. So we're able to pull out a bunch of stuff and make it way leaner code base

536
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,360
But we also went in and we redid the whole demo app

537
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:15,840
so it's way easier to find out like hey what utilities and widgets are actually supplied by granite and

538
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:22,660
Then with some new utilities for a date time though. We have a new relative date time utility

539
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:28,200
So you can give this utility a time and then it'll say oh that time

540
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,520
It'll give you a natural language string back like oh that's in five minutes. That's in three hours. That was yesterday

541
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,120
That was last week, you know

542
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:40,600
It'll give you like a natural language response. You can use in like your messaging app or scheduling or things like that

543
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:47,200
Nice. Yeah, I'm going through the post right now. It just looks looks so clean

544
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,560
I really like this demo app because as a as

545
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,620
As somebody who's maybe not familiar with what what all granite does bring you can just sit down here and basically tab through this

546
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,520
Application and see all the different stuff that it brings and it's the range is is pretty big

547
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,480
Actually, it's quite a bit quite a quite a lot of stuff

548
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:09,440
Do you I guess so this is 0.5 and I'm sure you're not gonna want to speculate about the future

549
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,840
But am I gonna someday see things on here?

550
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,800
like maybe like some sort of cloud related service on this tab or some kind of

551
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,400
Something that's unique to elementary OS like a like what other things?

552
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,080
Do you think down the road could be added to the sidebar of options that granite lets you integrate with your application?

553
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,240
Um, I mean, I guess the scope of granite is pretty big

554
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,840
Because it is just like whatever common widgets and utilities are in there

555
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,840
one of the one of the next widgets that I want to get in there is we built this sharing menu for

556
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,520
App Center so you can share links to apps and App Center

557
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:50,080
And so I really want to build that into a proper granite widget with a great API so that you can just say

558
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,300
like hey

559
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:56,880
I've got a string that's this many characters and it has a link and it's an image and then the popover will figure out like

560
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,920
Oh, like these are the social networks that accept all those parameters and then you know, like that's one widget

561
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,680
I really want to get in there. Very cool. I like that

562
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:04,880
Yeah

563
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,960
this is this is a nice write-up with with great pretty pictures too and I have it linked in the show notes if you guys

564
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,960
want to check it out and

565
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:19,080
I I would think it's got a it's got to help lead to the success of those 60 apps the fact that they're actually there

566
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,960
I mean if you stop and think about

567
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,400
The the hard work a lot of times on Linux is getting the UI right for developers

568
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,340
A lot of times we have a lot of really great applications and the UI is just a little rough

569
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,380
Well, I like it seems like that's kind of sometimes the barrier to like, okay

570
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,880
Well, I know how to make all the back end work

571
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,800
But to make it usable to you, I need to have like it doesn't have to be beautiful

572
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:45,200
But I just need a usable UI. So if this can make that trivial, that's awesome. Yeah, and it's not it's not electron, right?

573
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,480
See, that's the thing like that's that that would mean like, okay

574
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,080
Well, if I can just integrate this whatever else I was doing I don't have to jump to the electron band

575
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:56,440
Yeah, the other day. These are I mean correct down at the end. These are essentially GTK applications that are being produced

576
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,840
Yeah, it's all it's all GTK 3 and and yeah granite uses GTK behind the scenes

577
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,780
So it's they're all just GTK widgets that are kind of prefab

578
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,960
And one of the things that's super awesome

579
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,200
I think is that we've been able to get a developer ecosystem that's excited about

580
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,340
GTK CSS and providing like easy style classes for them to use

581
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,240
You'll see like a ton of the apps and App Center have nice brand colors

582
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:24,280
And they do interesting things with GTK CSS to look really nice. Mm-hmm

583
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,360
Well great work and nice post to good job on the write-up. It was a good read. So thank you very much

584
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,880
Thank you. Come on explain Matt. It's nice to pick your brain on that. Go ahead. Oh

585
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:42,000
Granite is built upon Fala, isn't it? Yeah, it is. Okay, and Valor is built upon GTK

586
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,200
So it might be an indirect, but that's why it's built upon GTK

587
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,960
But Valor really gives you a lot of power when it comes to scripting and it's ease of use

588
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:58,900
Doesn't it? Yeah, it's built. It's built purpose-built 4g object though. It feels really native to write

589
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,800
GTK with Vala

590
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,200
Hmm, that's what I've heard and I have looked into it before but I haven't bothered with it

591
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,400
You should give it another chance if you're familiar with C sharp

592
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,400
Then you'll be able to jump into it super easy. Like the syntax is buttery smooth

593
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:21,080
It's way easier than trying to write GTK with like C. Oh, yes G object all raw G object is

594
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,600
Brutal makes my eyes bleed. I

595
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,360
Every time we talk Vala, there's always some hater that comes along and talks bad about it

596
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:36,280
But every time I hear about it, it sounds like it sounds like a great way to go and it is a good intermediary

597
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,400
Yeah, exactly. And it's I mean the proof seems to be in the pudding more and more

598
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,680
There's some great apps and we've been talking about apps in the App Center

599
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,200
but of course elementary OS ships just with a bunch of great apps that are built around this and

600
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,880
Vala already installed out of the out of the ISO

601
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,680
So it's not just the things in the App Center

602
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,320
It's also the apps that have been getting shipped on and revved on now for years

603
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,880
Yeah, and the whole de to our desktop environment is all GTK 3 and Vala

604
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,840
I think I think we use more GTK in our desktop environment than gnome does these days. I

605
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,600
I

606
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:14,640
Now that I'm back on the 1604 bandwagon like never before I should I should give it another go, Dan

607
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,320
I should really take another look cuz damn if it doesn't all just look super appealing all the time

608
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:24,120
I like it and I'm liking 1604 a lot. It can't am I allowed to talk about that? Is that okay?

609
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:28,960
Okay, can I talk about well, so last week I I admitted that

610
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,600
after the whole 1710 excitement was over I ended up going back to

611
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:40,400
Ubuntu 1604 and then realizing that unity 7 was actually pretty great for my particular use case and

612
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,880
Then like a madman

613
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,360
Proceeded to just wipe all my systems and put up into and unity 7 with the exception of the OBS machine just because the capture

614
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,240
cards

615
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,080
and I'm all in and it's um

616
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,400
I'm loving it and I I think it's the new XFCE and

617
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,420
I

618
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,920
Thought I would get a truckload of shit for saying that last week

619
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:10,240
I was really expecting people to harp on me and I got a ton of people saying they were doing the same

620
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:18,560
Thing and they agreed really? Yeah way more than I expected. Yeah on all the all the feedback mechanisms. It was really

621
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,520
Surprising to me. It was like when I admitted that I like nano more than vim

622
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,040
I you know vim and I keep my vim skills active

623
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,640
But if I'm if I'm choosing I just prefer I prefer nano

624
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,120
I like the bottom area of nano where it just lays out the commands for me gotta hit them

625
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,480
I know that it prints. I just don't know how to use it. Oh, yeah. Yeah, and then of course and me

626
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,880
I'm a nanotech w that's I'm a nanotech w guy and I've been rocking that now for you know

627
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,600
Everybody always says here's the bullshit

628
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:57,280
Here's the bullshit emacs vim propaganda that you get fed as a sysadmin is every server you log into is always gonna have VI

629
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:02,880
So you just learn VI. Well, you know what? That's not true. Every server has vim first of all second of all

630
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:09,560
second of all it I have yet to meet a system that doesn't have like nano or pico or or

631
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:16,000
Joe or some other non vim editor. I just I don't I don't work on those systems

632
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I know there's systems out there. I understand that I don't work on those systems. Sure. And so I've always had nano

633
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,400
I've always enjoyed it. I've always thought it's been pretty great

634
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,000
and so one day on the show I finally came out and I said I

635
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,400
Like nano and I'm a nano user and I got a ton of people that said I also like nano

636
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,440
and I'm not saying Vim's bad or emacs and

637
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,280
Now I'm saying this with unity

638
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,520
I like unity and I think it's pretty good and I'm gonna use it for a while

639
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,120
And I thought I thought it'd be the same thing

640
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:48,560
I get flamed ton of people came back ton of telling people came Joe Collins made a YouTube video about it on his YouTube channel

641
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:55,620
About how he's going to you know, he's sticking with 1604 in unity. There's something about the LTS releases is when you when you

642
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:03,960
When you become an LTS user West you realize that all the other releases are just beta tests for the LTS

643
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:13,240
And they can call it 1710, but it really should be called 1804 beta. Yeah, where's that ding soundboard effect? Oh, oh

644
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,080
Man, I don't know what's happened to me

645
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,960
I feel like I feel like I've had some sort of like a

646
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:23,080
Psychedelic Linux experience and I've come out on the other side of it as a changed man is what happened to me

647
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,080
You'll be back large drug in six months

648
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,160
Unity there's one gripe that I cannot accept that there's a lot of its desktop

649
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:38,520
Functionality is implemented in Python and that's against my morals

650
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,120
Yeah, I can you know, I can see it

651
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:45,960
I can see switching for moral reasons and I tell you what if if I felt like that ever caused it to be slow

652
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:52,760
Or pokey or crashy I'd probably bail but so far. Yeah, you wouldn't care what was making it slower crashy. You just get out

653
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,360
Oh, yeah, the old XFC menu. It was based on

654
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:03,120
Python no, it wasn't the XFC menu. It was that desktop that was recently implemented in C

655
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,160
But it wasn't Python before

656
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,720
Goodness gracious does anyone remember? No

657
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,960
Okay. Anyway, I might have been a budgie. It might have been the budgie men. Oh, yeah

658
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,760
It used to be a mint menu. Okay mint menu is based on Python

659
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:24,000
They re-implemented it in C and it was way faster. Sure. I think but he's bitten written in every language

660
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Yeah, that's

661
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,120
Minimum and then you I can only hope unity goes down in flames, but I like nano

662
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:39,240
You know it as long as it's all small batch organically sourced 100% locally produced code

663
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:46,340
I'm okay with that. I would like to try unity and the new gnome with the Ubuntu shell. Yeah on the same system

664
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,800
I haven't done. Yeah, like do a little a B skis. Yes, that's I

665
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,520
Used unity at work all the time. I'm kind of like, okay. I wonder maybe I should try that

666
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:00,520
Try the new version out. See what that looks like. I feel like unity's faster having ran it on some of the same systems, but

667
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,240
Then again, what do I know? What do you what the hell do I know?

668
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,920
There's something about the fact that my doc isn't some extension

669
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:15,140
QML JavaScript, you know the quick like that doc here in unity. I don't know. It just feels really solid

670
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,160
It doesn't ever flicker. It doesn't ever

671
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,480
You saying you want to flicker in unity plug-in?

672
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,360
So I've just been on the gnome desktop long enough where my doc's just totally taking a shit. It's gone away and then I'm like

673
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,600
oh, so

674
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,480
Right. Okay, so I don't have that anymore

675
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,320
and then and then what it was is of course it was well gnome updated and the

676
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:39,400
Doc I had installed was from the repo but the repo package for the doc extension hadn't been updated yet

677
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:44,360
so I updated the gnome desktop the extension so then I had to uninstall the

678
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:51,480
Distros version of the extent of the extension then go to then then go then go to the gnome extensions website and

679
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:56,840
Install the extension separately see if you just don't install the doc extension then that's all right

680
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,840
But I take your point. I find it particularly useful just to have my sets of icons right there

681
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,400
I don't you know, I'm not a big doc guy. I doesn't have to be a bar. It doesn't have to be a doc

682
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,360
I don't care what you call it. Just call whatever you want

683
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,360
I can't don't have to get bigger when you hover on them

684
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,140
Microsoft got it right in Windows 7 when they added the quick launch down there. Yeah, they got it, right

685
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,140
and I

686
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:23,040
Ever since that I essentially try to get that and I just want I want my launcher and my searcher and I want my quick

687
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,720
launch icons and

688
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,720
That's what I go for and unity 7 does a pretty good job with that in a way that doesn't make me feel like I'm using

689
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,920
Windows at all, but still gives me that same kind of functionality. So it doesn't really make me think about it

690
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:39,100
That's what I like because that's the problem with mate and both with XFCE is like I'm like using Windows over here

691
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,600
I'm using Windows again

692
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:45,240
Digital ocean comm go over there and create an account and then use our promo code do

693
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:50,200
Unplugged you get a $10 credit and and with that $10 credit you could try their

694
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:55,560
object storage for two months for free so you can stack them and I don't know what maybe build some sort of

695
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,680
Media empire in like two months because with digital ocean you got their fast connection

696
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,280
You got their dashboard for days. You can deploy in seconds

697
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:07,200
everything's SSDs and you can choose the distro that best suits you or

698
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:15,040
Or even Alan Jude's free BSD and for me besides the object storage the block storage is it's just great

699
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,160
It's been around for a while and what I love about it

700
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,160
Is it shows up to the operating system as if it was just a block device?

701
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:26,960
So you can look in d-message you'll see it show up there and then you can go in FS tab and you can actually just

702
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,160
Mount it to a folder on your file system and it's just like dev

703
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,200
So can we install Gentoo on that thing? Is that our solution?

704
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,880
Boom boom, you know, I am thinking maybe you're not up for this challenge anymore

705
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,520
We'll see maybe you're the one that's supposed to be looking into that right now, that's true

706
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:50,260
Google that for us. Okay back to digital ocean digital ocean's also got monitoring and alerting and they have team support

707
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,160
Which is really great and then they got private networking

708
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,080
Which is fantastic because it doesn't count against your transfer when you use that private network

709
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:02,320
And that's great for like proxies or if you got a database or a backup server

710
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,800
Which I should probably do that. I should probably do that

711
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,520
I've got a new digital ocean droplet that has some pretty important data on there

712
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,560
So I even put that out on the public net just put put on the private one and then just let my droplets talk to

713
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,120
Each other digital ocean comm use our promo code do unplugged

714
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:25,480
Create the account apply that get the $10 credit and then you're off to the races digital ocean comm promo code do unplug

715
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:31,200
Hugged yeah, I wonder if you could do you think you could do you think you get that?

716
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,680
You think you get that gentoo working on a droplet. I'm right. I'll give it a shot

717
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:39,160
That's me. You could do that. Yeah, that would be pretty interesting. I would say it'd be interesting to try it

718
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,560
I was thinking of EM, but a triplet would be pretty dang cool

719
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,300
It'd be pretty cool. Okay, so

720
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,960
There is a story

721
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,080
That we're going there

722
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:54,160
We're gonna go to and I want to be really careful because this thing is gonna have big ramifications

723
00:53:54,160 --> 00:54:00,280
and it's one of these stories that is very easily turned into clickbait and it's very easily gonna

724
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,840
It's gonna be it's be it'd be simple to set the tone of the conversation in the wrong direction

725
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:09,960
On this particular story and I think it's too important of a story for that, but I also I

726
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:15,800
Don't want to ignore important things that are going on just because I'm afraid of screwing up the discussion

727
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,440
so we're gonna start with

728
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,280
what's going on between the Software Freedom Law Center and

729
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:28,680
The Software Freedom Conservancy two separate projects. I'm gonna refer to them as Law Center and Conservancy just to try to get yeah

730
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:33,800
That's that's a good idea. Yeah, the background between these two organizations is the

731
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:40,160
They well by all public appearances seemed to be two cooperative organizations

732
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:46,680
In fact, the Law Center helped establish the Conservancy early on was involved with that process and provided counsel

733
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:51,480
So they've been working they had a publicly appeared to be working in tandem

734
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,440
for quite some time

735
00:54:54,440 --> 00:55:01,360
I don't know exactly about the people running the two different organizations if they were working in tandem necessarily, but we'll get to that perhaps

736
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,600
on September 21st

737
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,800
2017

738
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:13,020
Eben Moglen on the Software Freedom Law Center's blog posted a rather long post that addressed IRS

739
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:20,360
Service changes now under the Trump administration versus the Obama administration and it restructured

740
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,700
how

741
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:28,540
the Software Freedom Law Center could move around essentially provide services for open source projects and

742
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:34,060
in this they they say this is game-changing for them and that the

743
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:41,220
they have they've been waiting for these developments and that the gives them and their clients the best of both worlds that

744
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,940
essentially, there's a new market that's going to be opening up for the

745
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:47,780
Freedom Law Center, they don't really kind of give any more detail than that

746
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:52,340
But shortly after that, I think it was on the 27th of September

747
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:56,620
We have more details concise and accurate details in this week's Linux action news

748
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,460
The Law Center sent a trademark

749
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:09,100
Notice to not not to not to the Conservancy

750
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:15,620
but like the patent office saying or whatever the trademark office saying we're concerned that there's confusion between the Software Freedom Law Center and

751
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:21,540
The Software Freedom Conservancy and I agree there is there is some confusion between the names

752
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:25,180
It is hard to to keep them straight. That's why I'm trying to say Law Center and Conservancy

753
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,020
and

754
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:31,340
It appeared that perhaps the Law Center was sort of gearing itself up to become more competitive

755
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:38,620
Then on Friday, November 3rd fast forward to Friday, November 3rd the Software Freedom Conservancy the

756
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:44,820
Which I believe is probably Karen Sandler and Bradley Coon. I think is his last name probably co-wrote this

757
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:48,700
I'm not sure but it's the staff they have they have assigned the staff and

758
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:55,060
They write a month ago the Software Freedom Law Center the non the not-for-profit law firm which launched the Conservancy in

759
00:56:55,060 --> 00:57:01,260
2006 took the step of filing a legal action in the United States Patent and Trademark Office seeking

760
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:05,460
cancellation of the Conservancy's trademark for our name the Software Freedom Conservancy

761
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:11,660
And they say in here that this is this is really weird because you know

762
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:19,380
We're all where the community has recently all come together and decided that we're all about taking every other approach first before legal action

763
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:22,620
that's what the Linux kernel enforcement statement was recently about and

764
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:27,940
They say yes, we sometimes disagree publicly about policy issues

765
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:32,740
But we're both sort of working for the same interests. So they were disappointed that

766
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:40,500
essentially public resources or community resources were being wasted on this action and it didn't really sound like there was any attempt to work with

767
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:46,180
Them it sounded like on September. Oh September 22nd that when when the petition was filed

768
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:52,660
That the process just started there was no communication before that is what is what the impression you would get by reading this

769
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:58,780
They say yesterday we provided an answer that defends the of the list of defenses that we plan to use

770
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:04,260
Now the element of this is this really something is this post was made

771
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:12,220
During an event that was being held by the law center that the the the people that are filing the petition

772
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:15,140
That's when this post went live was during this event and

773
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:20,140
My understanding is Karen was at that event. She she was there when this went public

774
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,420
Now the Conservancy is

775
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,660
home to about

776
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:31,340
46 member projects and you have to understand that this is

777
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:38,380
This isn't just membership. This is sort of like a governance a financial financial governance and

778
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:44,100
Copyright governance the copyright can be transferred in some cases and maybe all cases to the Conservancy

779
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,940
So this is an umbrella

780
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:53,700
Organization that is essentially home to some of the intellectual assets for these open source projects

781
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,700
And there's a bunch on their list core boots on the list

782
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,860
Debbie and copyright aggression project ether pad is on the list

783
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:04,740
That's where a bunch of closure projects are hosted get is on the list

784
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:08,900
The GPL compliance project for linux developers is on the list homebrew inkscape

785
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:17,300
There's a lot on this list. There's you know, it's a php my admin is on here outreach eqm you Samba

786
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:26,380
Some pretty important projects that this is essentially the home for this is the this is the legal structure for the copyright holder

787
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:28,820
Wine is also on that list

788
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,620
And so it's surprising that

789
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:37,260
That even Mowgli's organization who used to be part of the Free Software Foundation that ended about a year ago

790
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:42,620
Rather quietly that his organization who's funded by the linux foundation

791
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:49,300
Would be aggressively going after the Conservancy for trademark violation

792
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:53,420
When they helped them set up the organization in the first place

793
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:57,140
The law center helped launch the conservancy

794
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:07,140
in 2006 and they served as the Conservancy's law firm until 2011 and never had any trademark issue during this time

795
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:14,140
That seems pretty bizarre that seems pretty bizarre doesn't it

796
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:21,700
And people are raising all kinds of conspiracy theories because the law centers one of the law centers funders

797
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:29,460
Is the linux foundation and one of the linux foundation's biggest members is VMware and one of the companies that the Conservancy is actively going after

798
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,460
For GPL violation is VMware

799
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:40,500
So some people have drawn conspiracies there, although I wouldn't necessarily put any stock in any of that and I would say we should all definitely

800
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:46,020
Wait until way more information comes out because this really could come down to personality nuances

801
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:56,020
Between the people that run these different organizations because on Monday our rather bizarre post was made by the software freedom law center

802
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:58,020
By even Moglen's organization

803
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:03,020
And it's hostile. It's it's aggressive and it's

804
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:09,020
It feels like unnecessary like they would have been better saying nothing. I'll read a few highlights

805
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:17,020
So the law center responds to the blog post made by the Conservancy on Friday

806
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:27,020
And they write on Friday we were while we were putting on our annual conference at Columbia Law School a puff of near apocalyptic rhetoric about us was published

807
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:33,020
By the software freedom law center's former employees Karen Sandler

808
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:41,020
And Bradley Coon who now manage the Conservancy which was originally established and wholly funded by the law center and still bears our name

809
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:45,020
We were busy with our conference when this happened which seems to have been the point

810
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:53,020
We were glad to have the chance now after a little much needed rest to help everyone avoid unnecessary hyperventilation

811
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:57,020
And then they go into several different things

812
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:05,020
They claim that they attempted to make some contact they say we've asked intermediaries friends business associates comrades in the free software movement

813
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:12,020
Other alumni of the law center to stress to Bradley and Karen the importance of opening negotiations

814
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:18,020
One would think that this unless one would think this was unnecessary with people who talk so frequently about the importance of communication

815
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:21,020
And opening connections with respect to compliance

816
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:31,020
And enforcement but there when the shoe is on the other foot no efforts on our part have gotten us the slightest progress and bringing about discussions to resolve these differences

817
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:41,020
Friday's response to the Conservancy's management is grossly disproportionate and in view of their long maintained refusal to communicate with us irresponsible

818
01:02:41,020 --> 01:03:01,020
The entire piece and all of the outrage hangs on one thing and that is supposedly Karen and Bradley always said they were too busy or always too busy these are direct quotes to have time to talk

819
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:06,020
Sometimes we were not with sometimes we have not even been offered so much as the courtesy of refusal

820
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:20,020
But when wouldn't a law center know that they should probably be talking to the lawyers of the Conservancy shouldn't be lawyer to lawyer shouldn't they be reaching out to the representation of the Conservancy not to Karen and Bradley directly

821
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:28,020
Well I'm not so sure because if they filed the trademark action I imagine that would involve the lawyers right like you don't have to call the other law firm if you file a petition in court court delivers

822
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:44,020
But if you're so hell-bent on establishing communication before this action wouldn't you have tried to reach out to the representation you would think so yeah yeah I don't know what do I know it's really you know me all right but this is

823
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:57,020
This is one of these messes that on the surface looks like the law center wants to be in a new market and essentially take over the Conservancy's gig which it felt like it wasn't capable of doing because of rules

824
01:03:57,020 --> 01:04:10,020
That they as they put the Obama administration put into place that tied their hands and so it was necessary for them to create these umbrella organizations like the Conservancy out of out of these restrictive IRS rules

825
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:19,020
And now now that Trump's in and all these guys are out new guys are in these rules are gone and so we don't need the Conservancy anymore we don't need them

826
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:31,020
So let's just have everybody come back over here to law center and we'll be your representation will be your copyright holder will be your umbrella organization will be a one-stop shop everybody's happy the only problem is people don't understand it because the name differences

827
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:42,020
So let's just get them to change their name so we can compete it's what it seems like on surface to some people and that is dirty because the reality is the Conservancy the software freedom Conservancy

828
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:56,020
Should be something that is not subject to the political whims of the United States when when the when the political what they call it pendulum swings to the other side and different people come in running the IRS then what are we going to do

829
01:04:56,020 --> 01:05:09,020
Then the Conservancy will matter and when you have projects like wine that have been around for decades they're going to they don't want to be swung around by the different politics of the US and and moved around all the time the Conservancy offers a stability

830
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:34,020
And a home that is safe and from that political turmoil it's part of the whole spirit of the open source projects that we want to support in this thing and the you know the thing is like the Conservancy and I'm I you know I really don't have a dog in this hunt but just going off recent news the Conservancy seems to have been working with Colonel developers to come up with this enforcement statement statement that everybody seems to like and the thrust of it was legal action as a last resort

831
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:46,020
Which having talked to people who write Colonel code that's what they want that's what the people who write the Colonel want is they want legal action as a last resort only to be initiated when other community efforts have failed.

832
01:05:46,020 --> 01:06:01,020
That's what people making stuff want and if that and if that's what the Conservancy is also agreeing to then they seem to be representing the wishes of the Colonel developers and that seems to be a good thing in my estimation seems to be like the Conservancy had recently just made a good move and then.

833
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:05,020
Now this whole thing's breaking.

834
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:18,020
It's really it's really it's really interesting and I I don't want to speculate much because I think I feel like we've done plenty I've tried to represent what everybody's different theories are on this while still giving you the base fundamentals of when these things all went down.

835
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:37,020
I wouldn't I if I could give anybody any advice on this story don't participate in speculation online don't don't stoke these conspiracy fires because this stuff is all going to be an a long suit so super boring legal process that will eventually all be played out for us.

836
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:55,020
And it'll all be documented what exactly happened and we don't need to speculate if we're just patient the information of it'll eventually just tell the story the terror the story will tell itself and so I encourage all of us to try to tone down the speculation tone down the rhetoric or the clickbait.

837
01:06:55,020 --> 01:07:12,020
What do you call it you know if you people are going to be incentivized to tweet and blog post and make YouTube videos about this story and I encourage people not to do it because it's it's a nothing story so far it could literally come down to personality conflicts at the end of the day and it could represent tearing up tons of open source projects.

838
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:14,020
So there's a lot of better stuff to talk about.

839
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:28,020
Yeah. But the thing is we can talk about it but we can also just wait it'll all play out in the courts and everything will be right there in public record for us to review and we don't have to speculate if we're just patient. So that would be my be my advice said my piece.

840
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:30,020
I think it's a fascinating story.

841
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:45,020
Yeah right. I mean it's certainly important but like there's going to be enough bad and maybe good coverage of it there's going to be plenty of drama and other things that come out of it for better or worse probably worse. And so we pay attention but we don't have to create a whole hype machine.

842
01:07:45,020 --> 01:08:01,020
In the meantime I just hope the open source projects of these different organizations represent aren't screwed up with this I hope you know they're like their money isn't taking from from protecting or financing them or running them I hope that those funds don't have to be like redirected to fight this kind of thing like I hope nothing like that happens.

843
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:04,020
That's what I hope for. And then we just sit back and wait.

844
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:16,020
But if anybody in the number wanted to chime in you or have any questions because I know that was a lot to kind of unpack again I'll just make another plug for Linux action news because we did a much better job just breaking it down concisely and accurately.

845
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:30,020
But the development the response post wasn't out when we recorded Linux action news the software the law center the software freedom law centers post was wasn't posted until Monday.

846
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:38,020
Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. OK. Yeah. You good. You good. Yeah I'm good. You good. I'm good.

847
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:49,020
It's it's rough stuff. That's rough stuff. That's why I said we're going to have this really cool app pick at the end of the episode because this thing's not only is it look beautiful runs on the terminal but it helps you kick your Linux box.

848
01:08:49,020 --> 01:09:02,020
Box boxes but there somewhere I can speak I swear we're kicking but that's what matters. But it's gonna be kicked. It's a way to stress test your system. I know we have someone in our discord room who has a new oryx on the way.

849
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:07,020
And so this will be a great pick for him because he can throw this on his new oryx and kick the tires.

850
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:23,020
And then I'll just show you. I'll show you anyways. So let's let's take a moment and thank Ting for sponsoring the unplugged program go to Linux.Ting.com Linux.Ting.com $25 off a device or if you bring a device they'll give you $25 in service credit.

851
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:27,020
Nice. CDMA and GSM networks. So you can probably bring a device.

852
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:31,020
I'm a GSM guy myself. I have been for a long time now.

853
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:34,020
But I started out on CDMA and there's nothing wrong with that.

854
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:40,020
See people when they listen like CDMA what does it matter with you guys. Guys in the Pacific Northwest we got a lot of trees.

855
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:41,020
So many trees.

856
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:48,020
CDMA can punch through those trees in a way that GSM just does not seem to. I can't I can't explain it. I'm not a I'm not Neil deGrasse Tyson.

857
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:53,020
I can't explain it. But I can tell you this. You can play around. You just go to Linux.Ting.com to try it out.

858
01:09:53,020 --> 01:10:00,020
You pay for what you use six dollars a month for the line and then your usage and Uncle Sam's cut.

859
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:06,020
Whatever that might be in your area. He's got to always get his piece Wes.

860
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:09,020
But that's why he's going to pay his Ting bill.

861
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:12,020
You know what I'm saying though. That's why you got to start with the six dollar a month line.

862
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:19,020
Because that's just like that is at that price level where if I get that on a MiFi and I don't use it much one month I'm not feeling too guilty about that.

863
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:22,020
And the fact that I don't have to worry about how many minutes I may or may not use.

864
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:27,020
I love that. And they've got a great dashboard to manage it all. Tons of nice devices you can buy directly.

865
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:33,020
And then the best customer service in the whole industry. Check it out. Linux.Ting.com.

866
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:37,020
Big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the unplugged program.

867
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:42,020
All right. So it's stress terminal UI. It's kind of a it's kind of a complicated name.

868
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:48,020
So just shorten that to s t u i s dash t u i and it's nice looking.

869
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:53,020
Now I don't want to trigger I don't want to trigger heaven because it may be written in Python.

870
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:58,020
I didn't double check before I put it in. You install via pip. I'm sorry heaven.

871
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:02,020
I didn't mean to trigger you but I didn't realize that but it is a Python app.

872
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:07,020
But it's a command line Python app not a gooey Python app. So is that. Are you cooler with that.

873
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:13,020
Are we good. He's not talking to me now. You see that. That's how many he's cursing in the background.

874
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:15,020
It's funny so many won't talk to me now. Unbelievable.

875
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:19,020
So the stress terminal UI for your CPU is a great little way to.

876
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:28,020
Not only do you get CPU information but you get temperature and power usage information all visually graphed and represented for you.

877
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:32,020
You display the performance dips that are caused by thermal modeling monitoring.

878
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:41,020
Like you can actually see like when thermal when thermal like limits get hit you can really see it on this graph which is really cool for testing laptops.

879
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:44,020
That's why I mentioned the or interesting. Yeah that's not something a lot of other tools really highlight.

880
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:50,020
No you might see it like something like the XPS 13 or maybe the Gallego but you're I don't think you're going to see that on the Oryx at all.

881
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:53,020
You may not see it on other systems too but you can always try and find out.

882
01:11:53,020 --> 01:12:06,020
And then they have a stress operation mode for really just running the CPU into the ground for as long as possible which I kind of like that too when I'm trying to get a laptop really hot to feel like get a sense of what the fan noise is like for a review.

883
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:09,020
It's pretty cool. And you can also turn off different areas that you don't want to see.

884
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:17,020
So if you just want a nice simple display and you have this is the thing that really I think makes it look the best is it has this fancy graph smoothing option.

885
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:23,020
And I just something about really smooth fancy graphs on the command on the command line dude.

886
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:25,020
You know what I'm all about it. I just can't help it.

887
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:32,020
You start putting pretty graphs like that on a command line all of a sudden it like it's like the future meets my childhood and I can't help but love it.

888
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:40,020
So S-TUI and it's available via PIP and it could be a fun way to kick tires on a VPS too. It doesn't have to be like a laptop.

889
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,020
Oh yeah. Super easy to get going. Here we go.

890
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:44,020
Oh dude it looks really good on there.

891
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:45,020
It does look really nice.

892
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:48,020
That's with the window all maximized like that it looks even better.

893
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:50,020
Purple bars.

894
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:54,020
I got to say this is probably one of the slickest looking end curses I've ever seen.

895
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:57,020
I'm going to have to take a look at the look at the source there.

896
01:12:57,020 --> 01:13:02,020
They've done a really impressive job. That was actually what originally drew it to me and then I was like gosh I always am looking for ways.

897
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:09,020
I have like a I have like a little toolbox now of ways that I abuse review systems that are just like torture chamber tools.

898
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:12,020
Well you want to know. You know you only have a short time with the system.

899
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:18,020
I do. And I should give a I should give a plug to the open benchmark site and the Ferronix test suite because isn't that just the funniest thing.

900
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:25,020
You open that up and you go to the game section and sure enough if he's not keeping that thing pretty update to like most recent games.

901
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:34,020
As whole automated scripts will download it from steam and install it on your system and then play the game for a little bit and benchmark the whole damn thing like geez Louise.

902
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:38,020
If there isn't just an incredible incredible amount of work into that Ferronix test suite.

903
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:42,020
That's true. That's another way to bang on your system a little bit but this is just a nice quick way.

904
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:47,020
You could just load this if you got Python already on your system and it'd be easy to do on a VPS too.

905
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:50,020
Oh which I like that so and it just looks so good.

906
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:53,020
I should kind of a weird name.

907
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:55,020
Stewie?

908
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:59,020
I should put it on my yeah I should put it on my X to go system and just keep it going for a while and see how that does.

909
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:01,020
See how it see how it performs.

910
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:05,020
Boy that does seem like a nice way to like maybe benchmark some different VPS things.

911
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:12,020
Maybe it's just like a backwards Family Guy reference and it's just Stewie.

912
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:14,020
Terminal user interface.

913
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:16,020
Yeah let's do I do like Stewie. That's it. That's a good way.

914
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:19,020
Sounds like a user interface designed to stress the user.

915
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:21,020
Yeah we should that we already have that perfected.

916
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:25,020
So I think we're looking at the recording right now.

917
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,020
Yeah.

918
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:31,020
We're definitely so we're trying to come up with a way to do the Gentoo challenge.

919
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:33,020
We're going to we're going to really try to get it in the show.

920
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:36,020
We are going to try to get to this. We're going to try to get this in the show.

921
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:38,020
It's going to take forever man.

922
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:40,020
So but we have we have an approach we're working on.

923
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:42,020
I don't think we've totally nailed it down yet.

924
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:44,020
We were discussing the pre show.

925
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:47,020
So if you joined us live you kind of heard what our current thoughts are.

926
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:53,020
And so after the show Wes and I are going to compare notes and see which way we think would be the best to pull it off.

927
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:57,020
And then we have hopefully by next week's episode we'll have our game plan for the Gentoo.

928
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:58,020
I'm excited.

929
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:03,020
But I think what we should plan for for the focus of next week.

930
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:07,020
So it's not going to be the Gentoo review but we're going to tell you our plan for the Gentoo review next week.

931
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:08,020
See what we're doing here.

932
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:09,020
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

933
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:10,020
I don't.

934
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:11,020
You know what what happened was.

935
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:14,020
Listen we'll call this a stage zero install.

936
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:15,020
Yeah that's right.

937
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:26,020
So here's the thing is this like New York thing happened and then like this Ubuntu 1710 thing happened and then next Tuesday the Fedora 27 lands.

938
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:28,020
So I feel like we're going to have to talk about Fedora.

939
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:29,020
That's next week.

940
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:31,020
Next week's episode we got to talk Fedora 27.

941
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:34,020
So I'm going to be installing that to give that a go.

942
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:35,020
Back on to Gnome for one week.

943
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:38,020
I don't know what system I want to take off of Unity though.

944
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:40,020
I've got to go through that whole thing now.

945
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:41,020
It's going to be rough.

946
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:43,020
It's going to be so rough.

947
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:44,020
You're going to hate it.

948
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:47,020
So if you get a chance Wes install Fedora 27 the next few days.

949
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:48,020
Yeah. All right.

950
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:49,020
Kick the tires a little bit.

951
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:50,020
We'll talk about it on next week's episode.

952
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:51,020
I always love installing a new Fedora release.

953
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:56,020
And that invite extends to the virtual lug and those of you listening on your own.

954
01:15:56,020 --> 01:16:05,020
If you want to check out Fedora 27 before episode 223 kick the tires with us and then we'll all come back and compare notes and talk about it or listen along.

955
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:06,020
It'll be like a co-review.

956
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,020
You like that?

957
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:08,020
I like that a lot.

958
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:11,020
So we have a Discord room dedicated to this show now.

959
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:16,020
Go to Discord.me slash Jupiter Colony for the main link to the server.

960
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:18,020
And then once you get in there look for the Linux Unplugged channel.

961
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:22,020
And I'll mention in this because we're using this during our live shows.

962
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:28,020
So even if you can't make it live you can still go back after the show and see some of the stuff people talked about.

963
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,020
Some of the links people shared.

964
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:32,020
And you know maybe beat new community members too that might still be there.

965
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,020
It's like a live archive.

966
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:34,020
Yeah.

967
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:35,020
Yeah.

968
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:39,020
So it's kind of a cool way if you see something go by the video that you want or if you just want to check it in.

969
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:43,020
If you listen to the audio version you're like I want to just go see what the Discord room is talking about.

970
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:44,020
You can go over there.

971
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:45,020
We do still have that mumble room.

972
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:47,020
We're still doing mumble for the audio.

973
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:50,020
That's where our virtual lug still at is on our mumble server.

974
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:53,020
So still totally looking for people to join us there every single week.

975
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:54,020
Please. Yeah.

976
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:55,020
All right.

977
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:58,020
Guys is there anything else we want to include in this week's episode?

978
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:59,020
I don't think so.

979
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:00,020
Well very good.

980
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:02,020
Where should people find you throughout the week Mr. YS?

981
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:03,020
At Westpane.

982
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:04,020
You crazy SOB.

983
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:05,020
That's me.

984
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:06,020
Also check him out on the TechSnap program.

985
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:07,020
Oh please do.

986
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:08,020
What about you Beardsley?

987
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:09,020
Wrecked and done it.

988
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:10,020
There you go.

989
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:11,020
Nice and simple.

990
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:12,020
Easy peasy.

991
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:14,020
Find me tomorrow on the Unfilter Show.

992
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:17,020
Going to be a huge show.

993
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:18,020
Huge huge show.

994
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:19,020
You better be preparing right now.

995
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:21,020
And then I'm going to share a little rust shenanigans.

996
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:24,020
A little rust shenanigans in User Air.

997
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:27,020
So check out User Air this week if you're curious about that and it's a lot of fun.

998
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:32,020
Otherwise just grab our live time over on our calendar page and then join us next week if you can.

999
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:39,020
Otherwise grab the feed and we'll see you then.

1000
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:16,020
I think it's wasted effort.

1001
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:18,020
Who snuck him in there?

1002
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:19,020
Let's figure out this, Todd.

1003
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:20,020
We've got to get this thing figured out.

1004
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:21,020
Oh gosh we do.

1005
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:22,020
Come on now.

1006
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:23,020
We've got to get this.

1007
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:24,020
Let's get this thing printed out.

1008
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:25,020
Let's get it out of here.

1009
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:26,020
It's going to be dark here in just any minute.

1010
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:27,020
Come on now.

1011
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:28,020
Come on now.

1012
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:29,020
Let's go.

1013
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:30,020
Let's go.

1014
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:31,020
JBtitles.com.

1015
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:32,020
Perfect.

1016
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:33,020
Fine.

1017
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:36,020
I didn't get a hit of America compiling Gentoo.

1018
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:37,020
Winner winner chicken dinner.

1019
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:39,020
Winner winner chicken dinner.

1020
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:40,020
Ed is all you need.

1021
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:41,020
Nice.

1022
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,020
Nice.

1023
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:43,020
Dude where's my C?

1024
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:46,020
The division inside open source.

1025
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:48,020
A community divided.

1026
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:51,020
Token Ring has been killing it with the titles today.

1027
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:52,020
He's getting deep is what he's doing.

1028
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:56,020
He's reaching deep into his emotions and he's coming out with these real winners.

1029
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:59,020
I do want to do a Windows unplugged.

1030
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:00,020
I'm not going to lie.

1031
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:02,020
We could do it.

1032
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:03,020
Conservient rust.

1033
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:08,020
I was hoping we could just bang this out real quick.

1034
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:09,020
I know.

1035
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,020
I thought this would be a quick one.

1036
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:11,020
I thought okay this is the week.

1037
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:12,020
We're just going to be.

1038
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:13,020
We came in with a lot of energy.

1039
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:14,020
We get it.

1040
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:15,020
But that didn't work.

1041
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:16,020
That has already backfired I can tell.

1042
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:17,020
I can already tell.

1043
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:18,020
I'm burned out.

1044
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,020
Yeah.

1045
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,020
Yeah.

1046
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:21,020
We're tapped out.

1047
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:22,020
We're tapped out.

1048
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:27,020
Well you and I need to go on a sabbatical for five years and then come back and do one

1049
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:30,020
episode doing just one really good episode and then retire.

1050
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:31,020
Right?

1051
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:32,020
I'm in.

1052
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:33,020
I'm in.

1053
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:34,020
Yeah.

1054
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,020
Done.

1055
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,020
I don't think so.

1056
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:37,020
I don't think it works.

1057
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,020
Maybe I'll buy my own lady jubes.

1058
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:39,020
Yeah.

1059
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:40,020
There you go.

1060
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:41,020
We'll go caravanning.

1061
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:42,020
Yeah.

1062
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:43,020
Caravan.

1063
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,020
Actually the dream would be to caravan and still podcast.

1064
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:48,020
That would be a lot of fun.

1065
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:50,020
We'll just do road shows the whole time.

1066
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:51,020
That sounds great.

1067
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:52,020
Go around and do Linux meetups.

1068
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,020
Either great or entirely exhausting.

1069
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:54,020
Yeah.

1070
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:57,020
We'd be both of those things.
