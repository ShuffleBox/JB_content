WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.940
All right, well this has forced my hand.

00:01.940 --> 00:03.180
I have no option at this point.

00:03.180 --> 00:05.640
I'm going with the emergency pre-show topic.

00:06.900 --> 00:09.160
Initiating emergency pre-show topic sequence.

00:09.160 --> 00:12.340
Ladies and gentlemen, Microsoft is delighted to announce

00:12.340 --> 00:16.660
Windows Server 2019 is going into full preview mode

00:16.660 --> 00:20.580
and one of its headlining features is more Linux.

00:20.580 --> 00:21.500
What?

00:21.500 --> 00:24.600
Yeah, the improved and ready to go Windows subsystem

00:24.600 --> 00:27.500
for Linux will be moved up to the server series

00:27.500 --> 00:30.280
and they're introducing a new type of virtual machine

00:30.280 --> 00:33.680
designed specifically to run Linux instances.

00:33.680 --> 00:36.920
They'll also be shipping it with OpenSSH, Curl, TAR

00:36.920 --> 00:40.140
and other common Unix and Linux commands

00:40.140 --> 00:44.800
all pre-built into the shiny new Windows Server 2019.

00:44.800 --> 00:45.640
Wow.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.240
There you go, Wes.

00:47.240 --> 00:48.520
I don't know how I feel about that.

00:48.520 --> 00:49.920
So how long do you have to wait

00:49.920 --> 00:51.940
before you can spin one of these bad boys up, Chris?

00:51.940 --> 00:53.600
We'll just go grab the latest Ubuntu ISO

00:53.600 --> 00:54.720
and get started now, Wes.

00:54.720 --> 00:55.560
Oh!

00:55.560 --> 00:59.520
Hmm, this is Linux Unplugged, episode 241.

01:01.600 --> 01:02.800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged,

01:02.800 --> 01:05.340
Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly Linux talk show

01:05.340 --> 01:09.720
that's now recording in four individual stereo tracks.

01:09.720 --> 01:10.560
My name is Chris.

01:10.560 --> 01:11.380
My name is Wes.

01:11.380 --> 01:12.580
Hello, Wes.

01:12.580 --> 01:14.640
Boy, do we have a heck of a show coming up today.

01:14.640 --> 01:19.640
So not only do I have a couple of select moments from scale,

01:20.480 --> 01:25.180
I went down and got 170 individual clips

01:25.180 --> 01:27.880
and I'm playing one interview.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.400
That is choice.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.760
Hand-selected, hand-crafted,

01:31.760 --> 01:33.600
my favorite moment from my trip to scale,

01:33.600 --> 01:34.840
it's my first episode back.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.440
But before we get there,

01:36.440 --> 01:39.520
we have a huge batch of community news,

01:39.520 --> 01:42.020
open source projects that are coming back,

01:42.020 --> 01:43.880
big desktop releases,

01:43.880 --> 01:46.680
some plumbing that's getting some major updates

01:46.680 --> 01:49.440
and a cool trick to make Firefox, Firefox?

01:49.440 --> 01:50.280
Firefox!

01:50.280 --> 01:51.100
Do you have Firefox?

01:51.100 --> 01:51.940
Yeah, I sure do.

01:51.940 --> 01:52.780
It's all my facts.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.960
I'm checking the service that checks Firefox facts.

01:55.960 --> 01:57.840
I don't, everything is ruined.

01:57.840 --> 01:58.680
I don't know.

01:58.680 --> 02:00.560
Actually, no, it's a trick to get more performance

02:00.560 --> 02:01.760
out of Firefox.

02:01.760 --> 02:02.600
That's all.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.420
I'm sorry.

02:03.420 --> 02:04.260
It's nothing more than that.

02:04.260 --> 02:06.440
Also, a pretty well-known company

02:06.440 --> 02:08.560
is open sourcing all of the things.

02:08.560 --> 02:11.000
They just announced it today and they're rolling it out.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.080
A handy firewall utility for the Linux desktop,

02:14.080 --> 02:17.000
a better way to stream Spotify on Linux,

02:17.000 --> 02:18.520
and then we'll wrap it all up

02:18.520 --> 02:22.200
with a couple of choice choice app picks.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.040
That's solid, right?

02:23.040 --> 02:23.880
Wow, I'm excited.

02:23.880 --> 02:24.700
That's a lot of show.

02:24.700 --> 02:25.540
Stop wasting our time.

02:25.540 --> 02:27.800
Let's get to it, Chris, but there's a couple of things.

02:27.800 --> 02:28.640
You're right.

02:28.640 --> 02:29.720
First of all, we gotta say

02:29.720 --> 02:31.440
time-appropriate greetings to that mumble room.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.920
Hello, mumble!

02:32.920 --> 02:33.760
What's up?

02:33.760 --> 02:34.600
Hello.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.420
Good afternoon.

02:35.420 --> 02:36.880
Hello, it's good to be with you guys.

02:36.880 --> 02:38.320
I missed you last week,

02:38.320 --> 02:42.160
so thank you for hanging out with Noah and Wes

02:42.160 --> 02:42.980
while they did the show

02:42.980 --> 02:44.480
and thank you to Noah for hosting.

02:44.480 --> 02:45.320
No kidding.

02:45.320 --> 02:47.660
Of course, Ask Noah is coming up in just a little bit.

02:47.660 --> 02:49.600
But did you see this story

02:49.600 --> 02:51.460
that we're gonna start with this week?

02:51.460 --> 02:53.300
I mean, it just had to start with this story.

02:53.300 --> 02:57.360
LG has announced that they're re-open sourcing webOS.

02:58.480 --> 02:59.880
Let's go back in time a little bit.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.920
You remember this HP acquired Palm in 2010,

03:02.920 --> 03:05.480
and then there was this whole webOS

03:05.480 --> 03:07.760
on the touchpad thing that was short-lived,

03:07.760 --> 03:10.320
and then around 2012 is when HP announced

03:10.320 --> 03:12.760
that they would publish the webOS source code

03:12.760 --> 03:15.120
as open webOS.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.240
webOS was then acquired a little bit later on

03:17.240 --> 03:18.840
by LG Electronics,

03:18.840 --> 03:20.100
where they've actually been using it

03:20.100 --> 03:22.400
for at least a few years now

03:22.400 --> 03:25.680
on smartphone TVs, IoT devices,

03:25.680 --> 03:28.240
and other LG devices.

03:28.240 --> 03:32.040
I actually saw it, I think, on like a CES fridge.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.720
And LG has announced that they're gonna work

03:34.720 --> 03:37.560
in cooperation with South Korean's government agency

03:37.560 --> 03:40.880
that's involved with technology

03:40.880 --> 03:44.480
to make webOS a sustainable open platform

03:44.480 --> 03:48.080
that is available for an open connectivity architecture.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.320
They're looking to commercialize it as an open source

03:50.320 --> 03:51.160
platform.

03:51.160 --> 03:53.480
This is part of LG's announcement this morning.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.080
And it's up, it's up on GitHub,

03:55.080 --> 04:00.080
and I think it's sort of a semi-quasi-Android competitor.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.880
It's part of this play to just have a company

04:03.880 --> 04:05.920
offering a solution that isn't US-based,

04:05.920 --> 04:07.080
that isn't Google.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.320
Right, that seems like the main thing.

04:08.320 --> 04:12.520
Otherwise, it's all still very veiled and enterprise-y.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.380
It doesn't seem really like,

04:14.380 --> 04:16.120
it's good that they're open sourced,

04:16.120 --> 04:17.600
that part is great, but it doesn't feel like

04:17.600 --> 04:19.640
it's really, you know, there's not a great README,

04:19.640 --> 04:21.320
there's a whole bunch of components.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.680
Really, it's not something we would use,

04:22.680 --> 04:24.360
but maybe you're right, like there'll be some vendors

04:24.360 --> 04:25.940
that think, okay.

04:25.940 --> 04:28.360
Yeah, it just won't die.

04:28.360 --> 04:31.320
It just won't go, and great, you know what?

04:31.320 --> 04:33.080
God bless it, I think that's wonderful.

04:33.080 --> 04:33.920
Good on them.

04:33.920 --> 04:34.740
Can't kill Linux.

04:34.740 --> 04:35.840
Just keep going.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.200
And you know, we all have said,

04:37.200 --> 04:38.080
I mean, it's cliche to say,

04:38.080 --> 04:39.560
ah, webOS is one of the good ones.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.760
But it's, maybe this bears that out,

04:41.760 --> 04:44.960
because it just simply won't go away.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.680
And I tried to get one of those touchpads.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.040
I tried to do this whole thing.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.480
It was a total waste of money.

04:51.480 --> 04:55.640
But I have heard that their implementation on LG TVs

04:55.640 --> 04:57.640
is one of the better smart TV OSes out there.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.080
It is interesting going and looking through here,

04:59.080 --> 05:00.640
like PulseAudio integrations,

05:00.640 --> 05:02.440
Wayland extensions for webOS.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.080
Yeah, yeah, isn't that something?

05:04.080 --> 05:06.940
WebOS won't die, Wes.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.760
It just won't die.

05:08.760 --> 05:13.160
GNOME 3.28, also another big news item this week,

05:13.160 --> 05:15.720
incorporating 25,000 changes.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.200
Don't know how many of those are translations,

05:17.200 --> 05:18.400
but a lot of changes.

05:18.400 --> 05:22.280
And 838 contributions, or individual contributors,

05:22.280 --> 05:25.720
make up the 3.28 release.

05:25.720 --> 05:28.560
And it's got a couple of features that I'm a huge fan of.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.440
First feature, it seems simple,

05:30.440 --> 05:31.280
but if you think about it,

05:31.280 --> 05:33.740
it's actually gonna make working day-to-day really fast.

05:33.740 --> 05:35.960
The version of files in GNOME 3.28

05:35.960 --> 05:39.400
now has a starred feature, where you can star files.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.720
And then on the left-hand places area, you go to starred,

05:41.720 --> 05:44.160
and it's just the files that you've starred.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.280
This is great, because they've taken away desktop icons,

05:46.280 --> 05:48.040
so it sort of comes at just the right time,

05:48.040 --> 05:49.680
where you still have a kind of a workflow

05:49.680 --> 05:51.120
for quick access to files,

05:51.120 --> 05:52.080
and then when you're done with them,

05:52.080 --> 05:54.200
you just pop that star off.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.260
But that's not the big feature.

05:55.260 --> 05:56.780
The one that I really like to see,

05:56.780 --> 05:58.960
and I can't wait to see where they're gonna go next,

05:58.960 --> 06:02.560
is Boxes, the VM front-end

06:02.560 --> 06:04.800
that is one of my favorites on Linux,

06:04.800 --> 06:08.440
now has the ability, using the new Box Assistant,

06:08.440 --> 06:11.720
to download ISOs that you want right off the web.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.960
So you wanna try out Tumbleweed to try out GNOME 3.28,

06:14.960 --> 06:17.120
you just click the thing, it'll pull it down right there.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.320
Wow, that's slick.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.000
Yeah, Debian testing's in there,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.400
NetBSD's in there, it's awesome.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.360
Kind of makes it, changes the feel of it

06:24.360 --> 06:27.400
from somewhat of a, not quite power tool,

06:27.400 --> 06:29.080
but helper tool when you already understand

06:29.080 --> 06:30.220
how the virtualization works

06:30.220 --> 06:32.080
to something a little more user-friendly.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.240
Totally, totally.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.400
So that's the new Boxes feature,

06:35.400 --> 06:37.800
and the Photos app has gotten some updates.

06:37.800 --> 06:42.080
So new version of GNOME, I'm not running it,

06:42.080 --> 06:44.000
I did try it for a bit.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.200
You are, what are you running,

06:45.200 --> 06:48.080
some sort of quasi-hybrid Plasma GNOME setup over there?

06:48.080 --> 06:49.480
I do have both on here, yes I do.

06:49.480 --> 06:50.440
Which one are you in right now?

06:50.440 --> 06:53.000
Right now it's GNOME, I needed to test out on this side,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
but normally it's been Plasma for the past couple weeks.

06:55.000 --> 06:55.960
The reason why I even knew that

06:55.960 --> 06:58.080
is because your machine's been running crazy hot all day

06:58.080 --> 07:00.920
as the Evolution Data Server's been losing its crap, so.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.000
Yes it has.

07:02.000 --> 07:02.840
Woo!

07:04.120 --> 07:06.760
Yeah, yeah, there's only a really, at this point in time,

07:06.760 --> 07:08.560
that we're recording a couple of choice ways

07:08.560 --> 07:10.840
to get GNOME 3.2.8.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.240
Anybody in the Mumble Room by any chance

07:12.240 --> 07:15.680
actually on the new version of GNOME, GNOME 3.2.8?

07:15.680 --> 07:18.040
Like a Tumbleweed user in there by chance?

07:18.040 --> 07:19.640
I didn't think so.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.880
I bet you if Gabriel was in there, he'd say yes.

07:22.880 --> 07:24.400
But I've been pretty happy with Plasma,

07:24.400 --> 07:26.480
just got a whole batch of updates installed today.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.600
So the Plasma adventure for me continues on

07:28.600 --> 07:30.220
and I'm pretty happy with it.

07:30.220 --> 07:32.400
Levi too, Levi the dog is pretty happy with it.

07:32.400 --> 07:36.200
There's also a feature in GNOME 3.2.8 that Levi really likes.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.880
It's support for Thunderbolt 3 security models.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.760
And this is the accumulation of work

07:40.760 --> 07:44.980
that's been done by Red Hat now for quite a while.

07:44.980 --> 07:47.700
I first saw Joey over at OMG Ubuntu report about it

07:47.700 --> 07:50.120
on December 14th, 2017.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.880
And it was a project called Bolt.

07:52.880 --> 07:56.780
And what it does is it adds some security protections

07:56.780 --> 07:58.840
around Thunderbolt devices.

07:58.840 --> 08:03.040
So unlike USB, Thunderbolt 3 allows a wide access

08:03.040 --> 08:07.160
to devices on your memory bus, on your PCI bus,

08:07.160 --> 08:08.760
just like Firewire did.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.480
So it's speculated that you could hook up

08:10.480 --> 08:11.920
a malicious Thunderbolt device.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.160
It actually, I don't know if it's been proven

08:14.160 --> 08:15.200
with Thunderbolt.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.240
I know it has with Firewire.

08:17.240 --> 08:20.400
But in theory, because it's the same essential technologies

08:20.400 --> 08:22.600
the way it's on the PCI bus, you, as you know,

08:22.600 --> 08:24.920
probably could hook up a device to Thunderbolt

08:24.920 --> 08:27.760
and you could read what's on the PCI bus lane,

08:27.760 --> 08:31.700
the PCI lanes, which is contents of memory,

08:31.700 --> 08:33.440
the things that are being sent to the CPU.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.800
It's like you're an IO port right on the PCI bus.

08:36.800 --> 08:39.960
And so to mitigate against malicious uses of this,

08:39.960 --> 08:42.480
there are Thunderbolt 3 security levels,

08:42.480 --> 08:45.360
which has been supported at the kernel level

08:45.360 --> 08:46.200
for quite a while.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.180
But as you're probably guessing right now,

08:48.180 --> 08:50.440
hasn't been implemented in user space.

08:50.440 --> 08:53.480
This is where Red Hat's project Bolt stepped up.

08:53.480 --> 08:56.480
Their developers were working on this project Bolt

08:56.480 --> 08:58.980
to clearly handle Thunderbolt security levels

08:58.980 --> 09:01.880
at the Linux desktop while keeping it user-friendly.

09:01.880 --> 09:03.920
So what they've essentially done here

09:03.920 --> 09:06.840
is they've provided a D-Bus API to list

09:06.840 --> 09:09.400
all of the Thunderbolt devices, enroll them,

09:09.400 --> 09:11.140
which means authorize and then store

09:11.140 --> 09:13.160
which ones have been authorized in a local database,

09:13.160 --> 09:17.000
and then forget them when they've been removed,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.440
so that way there's not like an error message all the time,

09:20.440 --> 09:23.400
and emit an alert to the user if a new device

09:23.400 --> 09:24.960
has been connected or when that device

09:24.960 --> 09:25.920
has been removed as well.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.760
And during the enrollment, devices can be set

09:27.760 --> 09:30.720
to automatically be authorized as soon as they're connected.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.500
And so there needed to be a way to communicate this

09:33.500 --> 09:36.800
that was at least somewhat agnostic, so they used D-Bus.

09:36.800 --> 09:40.960
And now with GNOME 3.2.8, they've built in the front end

09:40.960 --> 09:43.820
to display all this information to the end user.

09:43.820 --> 09:46.880
So in GNOME 3.2.8, you'll click down on your status menu

09:46.880 --> 09:51.200
and you'll actually see a Bolt message.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.920
It'll say something like scanning peripheral,

09:53.920 --> 09:55.880
and you'll see peripheral secure.

09:55.880 --> 09:58.240
You'll see messages now in the status menu

09:58.240 --> 10:00.920
when you hook up Thunderbolt 3 devices,

10:00.920 --> 10:04.480
and that's because of this work to create this D-Bus API.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.960
And this is more and more important now,

10:05.960 --> 10:08.860
the devices like laptops have these USB-C ports,

10:08.860 --> 10:10.340
which are also Thunderbolt devices,

10:10.340 --> 10:12.740
so it's a little gray now to the end user

10:12.740 --> 10:14.000
what they're actually plugging in.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.780
Yeah, this seems like a surprising case

10:15.780 --> 10:18.280
where a Linux desktop is actually

10:18.280 --> 10:19.600
kind of ahead of the curve.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.480
These devices are only now sort of picking up steam,

10:22.480 --> 10:25.280
so it's great that we'll have this at least in one desktop

10:25.280 --> 10:26.180
integrated right away.

10:26.180 --> 10:27.760
Yep, yep, yep, I agree.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.160
And that means it's gonna land in the next version

10:30.160 --> 10:33.320
of Fedora, and it's already in Tumbleweed,

10:33.320 --> 10:36.420
and it means it's gonna be in Ubuntu 18.04.

10:36.420 --> 10:37.260
Wow.

10:37.260 --> 10:39.600
So that takes care of a large,

10:39.600 --> 10:41.560
low-hanging amount of GNOME fruit.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.160
So pretty happy to see that.

10:43.160 --> 10:46.960
And it's an example of kind of a behind-the-scenes project

10:46.960 --> 10:48.880
that Red Hat sort of is famously known

10:48.880 --> 10:50.180
for working on on the desktop,

10:50.180 --> 10:54.560
even though they don't make a ton of money on the desktop.

10:54.560 --> 10:55.600
You know what I mean?

10:55.600 --> 10:58.680
This Bolt stuff and baking into GNOME

10:58.680 --> 11:01.080
is specifically to benefit the desktop.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.480
Right, I wonder, I mean, is that just enough?

11:02.480 --> 11:04.280
There's enough people at Red Hat

11:04.280 --> 11:05.560
who use GNOME on the desktop?

11:05.560 --> 11:08.260
And I mean, if you're using USB

11:08.260 --> 11:10.920
or Thunderbolt 3 peripherals on your work laptop,

11:10.920 --> 11:12.360
you probably want them to be secure.

11:12.360 --> 11:15.880
Or it's possible that multibillion-dollar corporations

11:15.880 --> 11:18.000
play super long games,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.640
and maybe they are seeding a garden

11:21.640 --> 11:23.840
that they hope in another five years or so

11:23.840 --> 11:24.980
is gonna bear a kind of fruit

11:24.980 --> 11:27.080
that they can package up and start selling.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.160
I like that idea. Possibly, who knows?

11:29.160 --> 11:32.440
I mean, you just look at some of the stuff like Bolt,

11:32.440 --> 11:34.040
which is a significant development,

11:34.040 --> 11:37.000
and PipeWire, which you guys talked about again last week,

11:37.000 --> 11:38.820
which is a significant amount of development,

11:38.820 --> 11:41.400
and again, specifically for the desktop.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.260
Perhaps all these people at Red Hat,

11:44.260 --> 11:46.160
and maybe this is the case, actually,

11:46.160 --> 11:47.560
perhaps they're all doing it on their free time.

11:47.560 --> 11:50.040
Perhaps it's not Red Hat-financed.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.960
I don't know, maybe somebody involved could let me know.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.440
But it leaves us on the outside scratching our heads,

11:55.440 --> 11:58.040
going, well, why is this company

11:58.040 --> 12:00.480
that doesn't generate revenue from the desktop

12:00.480 --> 12:02.920
expending quite a bit of development time?

12:02.920 --> 12:04.640
Right, I mean, obviously we're happy

12:04.640 --> 12:05.480
about a lot of these things,

12:05.480 --> 12:07.600
but it does make you wonder, how sustainable is it?

12:07.600 --> 12:09.320
Will it keep happening? I hope so.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.740
It must be sustainable because they're doing more of it.

12:11.740 --> 12:14.420
It feels like it's not declining, it's increasing.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.760
So I would really like, where is it all going?

12:19.760 --> 12:22.860
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

12:22.860 --> 12:25.280
Geek Dad signing off right there in the chat room.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.400
So we're back on the IRC for this show.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.240
Yes, we are.

12:28.240 --> 12:31.040
And I met Geek Dad, I hope he doesn't mind

12:31.040 --> 12:32.120
me sharing his story a little bit,

12:32.120 --> 12:35.460
but he gets to come to scale, he's a full-time dad,

12:35.460 --> 12:38.040
and he's one of those dads that works really hard at it,

12:38.040 --> 12:41.240
and he gets to come out to go to scale once a year,

12:41.240 --> 12:43.200
and he's been going for quite a while.

12:43.200 --> 12:46.660
And he was pretty fired up, he tracked me on the way down.

12:46.660 --> 12:47.640
We were gonna try to meet up,

12:47.640 --> 12:49.840
but I was driving like a maniac, so it didn't work out.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.600
But when we got to scale, he created the Telegram group,

12:52.600 --> 12:54.960
got everybody organized, he went over

12:54.960 --> 12:58.240
and made the reservations at the Brazilian Meat restaurant

12:58.240 --> 13:00.480
for our nice evening meetup.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.320
I mean, just a super great guy.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.720
And so, yeah, that's Geek Dad going on there.

13:04.720 --> 13:05.920
He's gotta go pick up the kiddos.

13:05.920 --> 13:08.600
So if you wanna join us live, we do this show on Tuesdays,

13:08.600 --> 13:11.160
go to jblive.tv on a Tuesday, and you can get

13:11.160 --> 13:13.240
the specific time at jupitabroadcasting.com

13:13.240 --> 13:16.000
slash calendar, whoop, whoop.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.600
I got my squeaky.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.840
We gotta name the chair.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.000
Chat room, name, bank suggest titles,

13:21.000 --> 13:22.600
because I don't think you've given us a single title yet,

13:22.600 --> 13:23.660
and name my chair.

13:24.840 --> 13:26.000
What do we call it, the squeaky chair?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.400
Yeah, this is where you really make the difference

13:27.400 --> 13:28.240
in the show.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.060
Because it really does, you know,

13:29.060 --> 13:30.420
it makes a guest appearance in all the shows.

13:30.420 --> 13:32.520
It's the third host, it is the third host.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.960
And it's the best of them all, too.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.520
I know, and it knows it.

13:36.520 --> 13:37.360
So eloquent.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.320
It knows it, too.

13:38.320 --> 13:41.520
It makes us do things, but we'll leave it at that.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.940
Let's take a moment and thank Ting

13:42.940 --> 13:44.760
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.600
Go to linux.ting.com, that's what my chair did,

13:47.600 --> 13:50.720
and that's how my chair pays just what it uses

13:50.720 --> 13:51.560
for mobile.

13:51.560 --> 13:54.280
It's $6 a month for your individual line,

13:54.280 --> 13:56.040
and then your usage on top of that.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.760
So for example, if you're on Telegram

13:57.760 --> 13:59.360
or another messaging platform,

13:59.360 --> 14:03.080
you may not ever use or hardly use any text messages.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.920
I think legitimately now.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.920
The last text message I used was when Twitter

14:07.920 --> 14:10.000
wanted to give me one of their crappy two-factors

14:10.000 --> 14:13.080
and made me sign in and they sent me a text message first.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.060
One text message last month.

14:15.060 --> 14:17.880
Totally not worth paying for hundreds of text messages.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.680
I didn't make a phone call last month.

14:20.680 --> 14:23.120
I mean, I did make a couple of FaceTime calls,

14:23.120 --> 14:25.040
and I did use Telegram and Slack calling,

14:25.040 --> 14:26.000
but that's what I love about Ting,

14:26.000 --> 14:27.700
is that's how I prefer to communicate,

14:27.700 --> 14:29.560
so I pay for that stuff.

14:29.560 --> 14:30.400
Now why?

14:30.400 --> 14:32.520
That's how I can have three phones and pay 40 bucks a month.

14:32.520 --> 14:34.680
It's $6 for the line, and then you just pay

14:34.680 --> 14:36.600
for what you use, however many minutes,

14:36.600 --> 14:38.120
messages, and megabytes.

14:38.120 --> 14:41.760
Nationwide coverage, no contracts, Ting's got you covered.

14:41.760 --> 14:44.680
They have CDMA and GSM, and if you wanna just pick up

14:44.680 --> 14:46.560
a Ting SIM, it's $9.

14:46.560 --> 14:50.280
If you go to linux.ting.com, they'll take $25 off a device,

14:50.280 --> 14:53.480
and if you have a CDMA device or a GSM device

14:53.480 --> 14:56.760
that is compatible, just check their BYOD page,

14:56.760 --> 14:59.280
they'll give you $25 in service credit.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.240
It's so nice, it's so nice.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.360
My favorite combo when I'm running Android

15:04.620 --> 15:08.720
is a Nexus or Pixel phone on the Ting network.

15:08.720 --> 15:11.920
It's this completely clean, nobody in between me

15:11.920 --> 15:14.960
and my phone, I get stock updates from Android,

15:14.960 --> 15:17.580
Ting has zero incentive to get involved

15:17.580 --> 15:20.400
in reflashing my phone with a Ting experience

15:20.400 --> 15:22.600
so they have no reason to slow down the updates.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.580
Yeah, but how will I get all my custom music

15:24.580 --> 15:26.080
from the Ting music store, Chris?

15:26.080 --> 15:28.640
Right, and of course, the Ting video streaming service

15:28.640 --> 15:30.480
that has exclusive Ting content.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.960
Oh man, I hate that stuff.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.840
It's like you get to live in a parallel world

15:34.840 --> 15:37.280
where it all just makes sense and you don't hate yourself.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.840
Yeah, where they had to do it right.

15:38.840 --> 15:39.840
That's what I love about it.

15:39.840 --> 15:43.320
Linux.ting.com, support the show and get $25 in credit.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.480
Linux.ting.com.

15:45.480 --> 15:47.760
What do you guys say we take a moment

15:47.760 --> 15:50.040
and my chair really wants to share a story

15:50.040 --> 15:52.280
about the plumbing of our desktops.

15:52.280 --> 15:55.160
GStreamer is the framework that really

15:55.160 --> 15:57.020
just kept on chugging.

15:57.020 --> 15:59.940
I don't know, I mean, I first started talking

15:59.940 --> 16:03.680
about GStreamer back in the Lunduke days

16:03.680 --> 16:04.800
of Linux Action Show.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.680
I mean, it's been a really, really long time

16:07.680 --> 16:11.440
that it came about and I have not seen

16:11.440 --> 16:15.680
many multimedia frameworks that have stayed relevant

16:15.680 --> 16:17.320
and continue to get additional usage.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.100
So we just were talking about PipeWire.

16:19.100 --> 16:21.620
PipeWire is plugging into GStreamer.

16:21.620 --> 16:23.520
Like it's something that they're actively developing

16:23.520 --> 16:27.200
for our Wayland future and GStreamer is a big part of that.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.940
And so I thought, well, it's obviously

16:28.940 --> 16:30.400
still a relevant technology.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.860
Even as plasma users use it, what's coming up?

16:33.860 --> 16:37.080
So the new version, a new major release came out this week

16:37.080 --> 16:39.620
and it adds some pretty fundamental features

16:39.620 --> 16:42.100
that, holy crap, is gonna make live streaming

16:42.100 --> 16:43.720
JB shows a lot easier.

16:43.720 --> 16:46.440
But first of all is WebRTC support.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.280
Nice.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.880
Uh-huh, baked in to fricking GStreamer

16:49.880 --> 16:52.640
will be real time audio and video streaming

16:52.640 --> 16:55.400
in and to and from web browsers.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.200
The whole pipeline now, from your browser

16:57.200 --> 16:59.000
down to your multimedia framework

16:59.000 --> 17:00.520
is gonna be WebRTC aware.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.340
I think that's a big deal.

17:01.340 --> 17:02.440
That's huge.

17:02.440 --> 17:06.780
Video for Linux support, including encoding support,

17:06.780 --> 17:09.360
stable element names and faster device probing,

17:09.360 --> 17:11.720
which means things like OBS may be able to bring

17:11.720 --> 17:13.840
certain GStreamer devices in now.

17:13.840 --> 17:15.320
I think that's gonna be really nice.

17:15.320 --> 17:19.720
I'm skipping a few other ones, RTSP 2.0 support,

17:19.720 --> 17:23.520
QuickTime Muxer support, a new pre-fill recording mode

17:23.520 --> 17:27.520
that allows editors to import into Adobe Premiere

17:27.520 --> 17:29.680
and Final Cut Pro QuickTime files

17:29.680 --> 17:31.280
while they're still being written to,

17:31.280 --> 17:32.220
which think about that.

17:32.220 --> 17:34.500
Think about how fast those editors have to work

17:34.500 --> 17:36.920
if they're editing files that are still being written to.

17:36.920 --> 17:39.920
And then for you binary NVIDIA users,

17:39.920 --> 17:42.800
a new plugin for hardware accelerated video decoding

17:42.800 --> 17:45.240
using the NVIDIA API.

17:45.240 --> 17:47.200
And back to live streaming,

17:47.200 --> 17:50.960
Adaptive Dash Trick Play support,

17:50.960 --> 17:51.920
which is also a big deal.

17:51.920 --> 17:54.040
There's also some GStreamer C sharp bindings

17:54.040 --> 17:55.800
that have made their way in there

17:55.800 --> 18:00.680
and some Rust bindings that are now being baked in.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.040
The chair approves.

18:03.040 --> 18:03.880
It sure does.

18:03.880 --> 18:06.840
This is fancy and I mean, there's like a lot,

18:06.840 --> 18:08.080
I feel like a lot of people don't necessarily

18:08.080 --> 18:10.440
use GStreamer directly unless they are doing

18:10.440 --> 18:12.120
some of this plumbing or maybe involved

18:12.120 --> 18:14.000
in video production, audio production work.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.160
Yeah, you're watching a video or listening to an MP3,

18:16.160 --> 18:17.680
you don't have any thought about the backend

18:17.680 --> 18:20.000
of decoding that audio that's happening in GStreamer.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.440
But it really is, it's got its fingers everywhere.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.520
So these improvements can just be benefited,

18:24.520 --> 18:27.360
anything that uses it and then uses the new release, boom.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.840
And having a common API like this makes developing

18:29.840 --> 18:32.440
good multimedia applications on the Linux desktop possible

18:32.440 --> 18:34.560
because you have an API to develop against

18:34.560 --> 18:37.400
and they're also releasing binaries for Android,

18:37.400 --> 18:40.360
iOS, Mac 10 and Windows in the next few days.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.200
Wow.

18:41.200 --> 18:44.520
Yeah, it makes it an actual viable API to write against.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.520
iOS binaries, fancy.

18:46.520 --> 18:47.920
I wonder what that means.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.720
I wonder if that means you bundle it in

18:49.720 --> 18:50.560
with your application.

18:50.560 --> 18:51.720
I would assume so, yeah.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.320
So in the backend you're using GStreamer

18:53.320 --> 18:55.860
and the user is none the wiser on an iPhone.

18:56.840 --> 18:57.760
That's awesome.

18:57.760 --> 19:01.080
We talked about Firefox 59 on Linux Action News this week.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.840
There's a few things that I really like about it.

19:02.840 --> 19:05.400
Their screenshot tool is actually getting pretty useful.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.200
Let's you like mark it up now

19:07.200 --> 19:08.320
and copy it right to the clipboard,

19:08.320 --> 19:10.620
which is great for when you just wanna drop it in Telegram.

19:10.620 --> 19:14.480
And they have some new blocking features,

19:14.480 --> 19:15.800
but none of that matters, none of that matters

19:15.800 --> 19:17.560
because it's not about making it much faster.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.400
Windows and Mac users got something

19:19.400 --> 19:21.360
that us Linux users didn't get this time around.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.440
And I can't have that.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.280
What?

19:24.280 --> 19:25.280
So we gotta write that wrong.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.920
We have got to write that wrong, right?

19:26.920 --> 19:30.600
There is this cool new feature called

19:30.600 --> 19:32.280
off main thread painting.

19:33.140 --> 19:34.680
You can just tell by the name you want that.

19:34.680 --> 19:35.520
I want it right now.

19:35.520 --> 19:38.000
It's not on the main thread and it involves painting,

19:38.000 --> 19:39.440
which probably means drawing my thing.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.320
Slow.

19:40.320 --> 19:41.360
Yeah.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.120
And on Linux, unfortunately,

19:43.120 --> 19:45.600
it has to be turned on manually.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.320
You go to, what is it?

19:47.320 --> 19:48.840
It's about colon config

19:48.840 --> 19:52.920
and then search for layers.omtp.enabled

19:52.920 --> 19:53.920
and set that to true,

19:53.920 --> 19:57.040
which I did that about a day ago

19:57.040 --> 19:58.580
and haven't really had any problems.

19:58.580 --> 20:00.800
I don't know if I noticed any massive performance changes

20:00.800 --> 20:01.640
either.

20:01.640 --> 20:05.080
So you're not getting the Linux unplugged certified.

20:05.080 --> 20:07.460
This is your hack to make kind of thing.

20:07.460 --> 20:10.220
This is just, you've been warned.

20:10.220 --> 20:11.360
You may or may not want to turn it on,

20:11.360 --> 20:13.760
but I seem to feel like it is worth it

20:13.760 --> 20:16.240
because so far I haven't had any noticeable downsides

20:16.240 --> 20:20.280
and there is documented benchmarks that show

20:20.280 --> 20:22.000
it is significantly faster

20:22.000 --> 20:25.240
when you draw the webpage off the main thread.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.600
It leaves the UI more responsive and other things like that.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.440
So it seems like a no-brainer.

20:29.440 --> 20:30.360
My chair approves.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.200
I think Levi approves.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.400
I think he approves, yeah.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.480
We have a special in guest dog this week

20:34.480 --> 20:37.400
who has made Wes his friend.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.120
Levi just decided this week that this was the episode

20:40.120 --> 20:41.800
he wants to sit in Wes's lap.

20:41.800 --> 20:45.080
And Wes thought he had a choice in the matter.

20:45.080 --> 20:47.080
I assumed I did, but nope.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.960
Nope, I am just a chair today.

20:48.960 --> 20:49.800
Studio dog.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.240
Levi is actually the co-host.

20:51.240 --> 20:52.080
Yeah.

20:53.080 --> 20:54.220
You know, he missed you.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.060
Oh, I missed him too.

20:55.060 --> 20:56.840
You know, we were in California and he missed you.

20:56.840 --> 21:00.040
So there's a company that I've bumped into a few times

21:00.040 --> 21:01.720
and you hear about them every now and then

21:01.720 --> 21:03.420
when it comes to funding.

21:03.420 --> 21:05.500
It's Private Internet Access.

21:05.500 --> 21:09.440
And they've been sponsoring several open source projects.

21:09.440 --> 21:12.960
And of course they run Linux for their VPN infrastructure.

21:12.960 --> 21:15.440
And they're self-labeled longtime supporters

21:15.440 --> 21:17.240
of free and open source software.

21:17.240 --> 21:20.120
Well today, they've started the process

21:20.120 --> 21:22.280
of open sourcing their software.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.840
And over the next six months,

21:23.840 --> 21:25.660
they're gonna release all of the code

21:25.660 --> 21:27.600
for their client-side applications,

21:27.600 --> 21:31.560
as well as libraries and extensions as open source.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.300
They go on to say they're extremely grateful

21:33.300 --> 21:35.240
to the free and open source software community

21:35.240 --> 21:38.160
for creating the foundations of the internet as we know it.

21:38.160 --> 21:40.640
And while we may be late to the party,

21:40.640 --> 21:43.060
we are looking forward to furthering our work

21:43.060 --> 21:45.840
with a movement that aligns with our own passions

21:45.840 --> 21:48.260
on our own personal and professional levels.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.040
That resonates with me, actually.

21:51.040 --> 21:51.880
Absolutely.

21:52.940 --> 21:55.480
I feel a lot of the same feels there.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.640
They say we believe that the shift to open source

21:57.640 --> 22:01.240
is a right move for a privacy-focused business.

22:01.240 --> 22:02.240
Completely agree with that.

22:02.240 --> 22:05.320
And recognize that code transparency is key.

22:05.320 --> 22:08.400
We appreciate that our code may not be perfect,

22:08.400 --> 22:10.520
coming at it with a little bit of a humble attitude.

22:10.520 --> 22:12.720
And we hope that the wider FOSS community

22:12.720 --> 22:14.840
will get involved, provide feedback,

22:14.840 --> 22:17.120
feature requests, bug fixes,

22:17.120 --> 22:19.340
and generally help provide a greater service

22:19.340 --> 22:22.260
to the wider privacy movement.

22:22.260 --> 22:25.120
Today, we're opening up the first of many repositories,

22:25.120 --> 22:27.320
the Chrome extension that allows our users

22:27.320 --> 22:30.600
to access our network of proxies from their web browser.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.120
The Chrome extension also boasts

22:32.120 --> 22:34.240
additional privacy and security features,

22:34.240 --> 22:36.680
such as disabling your microphone and camera,

22:36.680 --> 22:39.920
blocking flash and IP discovery through WebRTC,

22:39.920 --> 22:43.240
and it also can automatically block ads.

22:43.240 --> 22:44.080
Fancy.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.040
So they're opening that up.

22:45.040 --> 22:48.720
They also have a private internet access chat room

22:48.720 --> 22:52.000
on Freenode, if you want to go to chat.freenode.net

22:52.000 --> 22:54.520
and go into private internet access for there.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.400
And they say, yeah, our long-term goal

22:56.400 --> 22:59.600
is to release all of our code into the open.

22:59.600 --> 23:00.440
That's fantastic.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.920
I mean, especially as a company that sells a service

23:02.920 --> 23:06.280
that's really just backend infrastructure to run VPNs,

23:06.280 --> 23:08.640
it makes complete sense to be able to do this.

23:08.640 --> 23:11.640
And so, of course their code's not perfect.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.940
It's always just been proprietary before.

23:14.940 --> 23:15.780
This is fantastic.

23:15.780 --> 23:18.280
And I'm sure it will get them more open source

23:18.280 --> 23:19.560
advocates and users.

23:19.560 --> 23:20.760
I'm definitely gonna take another look.

23:20.760 --> 23:25.040
JJ, you've looked at private internet access before.

23:25.040 --> 23:28.320
I've heard about it on various podcasts and stuff.

23:28.320 --> 23:34.120
My question would be, how would this spec up

23:34.120 --> 23:38.000
versus ProtonVPN?

23:38.000 --> 23:38.600
I don't know.

23:38.600 --> 23:42.920
I was thinking about, I wonder how it compares to AirVPN,

23:42.920 --> 23:46.200
which has been my VPN provider of choice for quite a while

23:46.200 --> 23:50.640
now, for a couple of years, which I was able to sign up

23:50.640 --> 23:52.280
anonymously using Bitcoin.

23:52.280 --> 23:55.560
And I've never provided them with a username or location.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.560
And they have a ton of servers to choose from.

23:57.560 --> 24:00.680
And they will generate open VPN profiles and all those things

24:00.680 --> 24:01.440
that I really like.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.000
But they're not open source.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.880
And I kind of think that that really

24:05.880 --> 24:07.680
is sort of a nice differentiator.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.000
And they're smart to identify that.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.680
It's very savvy to identify that as a differentiator

24:12.680 --> 24:14.400
for their market.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.360
And Duck Who in the chat room says

24:16.360 --> 24:18.080
he just subscribed yesterday.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.480
Either way, it's a good move.

24:19.480 --> 24:20.960
It's smart of them.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.520
Wes and I in the, well, before the hire,

24:23.520 --> 24:26.160
it's our pre-pre-pre-show, I guess, technically,

24:26.160 --> 24:27.720
because we weren't on the air yet.

24:27.720 --> 24:30.960
But Wes and I were just recently kind of discussing WireGuard,

24:30.960 --> 24:33.480
going back to Tink VPNs.

24:33.480 --> 24:34.480
What do we want to do?

24:34.480 --> 24:38.060
We both kind of have a need for a VPN service.

24:38.060 --> 24:41.120
But we more like want to bridge lands together.

24:41.120 --> 24:43.520
So we're both kind of on the fence.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.640
I've been leaning more towards Tink myself.

24:45.640 --> 24:46.520
What about you?

24:46.520 --> 24:49.040
Where did you fall down on that?

24:49.040 --> 24:52.520
I've actually still have Tink deployed pretty successfully,

24:52.520 --> 24:54.400
bridging some lands and that.

24:54.400 --> 24:55.640
Oh, you are still using it.

24:55.640 --> 24:56.140
I am.

24:56.140 --> 24:58.720
It's not as pervasive on my network as it once was.

24:58.720 --> 25:00.480
So now it's kind of just using that and not

25:00.480 --> 25:02.480
as much for the mesh functionality, which

25:02.480 --> 25:04.920
is why, really, I was thinking about replacing it.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.840
I've been thinking about giving WireGuard a more real try.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.640
I've used it for some point-to-point stuff.

25:09.640 --> 25:13.240
But I thought it'd be fun to try to get a larger installation.

25:13.240 --> 25:13.960
Yeah.

25:13.960 --> 25:16.560
Anybody in the Mumba room got an active VPN account

25:16.560 --> 25:18.280
that they're pretty happy with, a service

25:18.280 --> 25:21.120
that they like that works well with Linux?

25:21.120 --> 25:23.120
And there's different needs, right?

25:23.120 --> 25:24.240
Very much so.

25:24.240 --> 25:27.480
There's rerouting to get around, say, region blocks.

25:27.480 --> 25:29.920
And then there is just trying to bridge land.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.840
So there's different uses, which I kind of have the former.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.120
That's what mine is.

25:34.120 --> 25:34.620
Right.

25:34.620 --> 25:37.120
Yeah, sometimes you need to go on.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.920
But you have the most experience with OpenVPN,

25:38.920 --> 25:41.440
which is still working for me.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.200
I have it set up on a VPS.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.120
Yeah.

25:44.120 --> 25:47.280
Yeah, I know a lot of people in the audience do that, too.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.400
Levi prefers that.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.800
Levi likes to just set it up on a DigitalOcean droplet

25:50.800 --> 25:52.280
in the London data center.

25:52.280 --> 25:53.440
And then he VPNs into that.

25:53.440 --> 25:56.360
That's Levi the dog's trick.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.240
Isn't that, Levi?

25:57.240 --> 25:58.640
Yeah, that's a good point.

25:58.640 --> 25:59.240
All right, Wes.

25:59.240 --> 26:02.160
Well, speaking of VPSs, let's talk about this really quick.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.400
DigitalOcean.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.000
Oh.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.640
Well, how perfect was that?

26:05.640 --> 26:08.360
It's almost like I didn't actually plan that.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.840
I wish we were that savvy.

26:09.840 --> 26:12.680
I wish we planned the show to that level of a fine detail.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.760
First, we'll talk about VPSs.

26:14.760 --> 26:17.640
And then we'll get Mitt Free to say that he runs his own VPS.

26:17.640 --> 26:18.600
And then we'll segue.

26:18.600 --> 26:19.680
Nope.

26:19.680 --> 26:22.520
It's just because these things are very useful.

26:22.520 --> 26:23.720
That's why it comes up.

26:23.720 --> 26:24.600
DigitalOcean.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.120
It's simplicity at scale.

26:26.120 --> 26:29.560
And they have a very special offer for limited time,

26:29.560 --> 26:30.720
hot off the presses.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.720
That's the presses when people make those noises.

26:32.720 --> 26:32.960
Don't worry.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.000
They're open source presses.

26:34.000 --> 26:34.520
That's right.

26:34.520 --> 26:35.360
Absolutely.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.560
do.co slash unplugged.

26:37.560 --> 26:39.760
If you have a new account and you go to that URL,

26:39.760 --> 26:41.720
if you sign up for a new account and go to that URL,

26:41.720 --> 26:44.480
you can get a limited time $100 credit for 60 days.

26:44.480 --> 26:47.280
Oh, this is a great way to play around with DigitalOcean

26:47.280 --> 26:49.640
because everything on DigitalOcean is wicked fast.

26:49.640 --> 26:52.360
So you can go build a crazy, super powerful system

26:52.360 --> 26:55.680
or build something and just get that $100

26:55.680 --> 26:57.320
like for the full 60 days.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.120
I mean, you could really just fine tune it.

26:59.120 --> 27:01.400
They also have new flexible droplets, mix and match,

27:01.400 --> 27:02.960
depending on what your application needs.

27:02.960 --> 27:05.360
So yeah, you could also play around with that.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.680
And I go to this all the time.

27:06.680 --> 27:08.600
Like when I want to experiment with something,

27:08.600 --> 27:10.520
what I love about DigitalOcean is

27:10.520 --> 27:13.040
I'm able to think about who is the audience?

27:13.040 --> 27:13.720
Is it me?

27:13.720 --> 27:15.200
Is it the audience themselves?

27:15.200 --> 27:17.280
Is it somebody in an area where I could spin up

27:17.280 --> 27:19.320
the server in their location?

27:19.320 --> 27:20.320
That's what I love.

27:20.320 --> 27:23.040
Then there's this ability to transfer ownership.

27:23.040 --> 27:25.560
So after I've created it, I can give it off to somebody.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.520
We use that between Noah and I all the freaking time.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.800
It's really useful, especially when we just

27:30.800 --> 27:34.000
spin up infrastructure for an on-location gig.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.480
We use it for one weekend.

27:35.480 --> 27:36.480
And he has the image.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.880
You can send it over here.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.080
It's a super powerful system.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.520
And they have team accounts.

27:40.520 --> 27:42.360
So you have all of this great functionality.

27:42.360 --> 27:44.920
And they manage to deliver it all in a really easy

27:44.920 --> 27:46.200
to use dashboard.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.960
It's super straightforward for pros or beginners.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.560
A documented API.

27:50.560 --> 27:52.440
And then SSDs for everything.

27:52.440 --> 27:54.840
40 gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.720
Eight data centers all over the world.

27:56.720 --> 27:59.360
And for a limited time, a $100 credit

27:59.360 --> 28:04.400
when you go to dio.co slash unplugged.

28:04.400 --> 28:07.440
I just waved the paper around, basically saying,

28:07.440 --> 28:08.840
enough said right there.

28:08.840 --> 28:09.840
Enough said right there.

28:09.840 --> 28:12.840
I'll mention this, because this is boss level stuff.

28:12.840 --> 28:14.920
You may have heard of Cloudflare.

28:14.920 --> 28:16.440
You may have heard of NGINX.

28:16.440 --> 28:18.320
And there's a possibility, a remote chance

28:18.320 --> 28:19.480
you've heard of Ubuntu.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.400
What about putting all those things together?

28:21.400 --> 28:24.520
They have a guide on how to host a website using Cloudflare

28:24.520 --> 28:26.640
and NGINX on Ubuntu 16.04.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.080
So Cloudflare is a service that sits

28:28.080 --> 28:29.800
between the visitor and the website.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.480
And it's a CDN, as well as DDoS mitigation.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.560
It's also a great way to do SSL acceleration

28:34.560 --> 28:36.160
if you have a whole bunch of domains

28:36.160 --> 28:38.320
and you want to put an SSL cert in front of all of it.

28:38.320 --> 28:39.840
It's a really handy service.

28:39.840 --> 28:42.400
NGINX is a very popular web server

28:42.400 --> 28:43.680
for a lot of good reasons.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.140
You combine all that stuff together,

28:45.140 --> 28:47.680
and they've got an awesome guide on how to do it.

28:47.680 --> 28:50.280
They've got really good stuff over there, dio.co slash

28:50.280 --> 28:51.360
unplugged.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.640
They also do a great job of supporting open source projects.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.280
Yeah, they do.

28:54.280 --> 28:54.980
Boom.

28:54.980 --> 28:57.240
In fact, if I could give them any recommendations,

28:57.240 --> 28:59.040
it would be maybe promote that a little more.

28:59.040 --> 29:01.280
I know they do it just because they want to give back.

29:01.280 --> 29:03.200
But there is some entire projects

29:03.200 --> 29:05.540
where their entire infrastructure runs on D.O.

29:05.540 --> 29:08.280
And they don't pay a cent, and it's pretty cool.

29:08.280 --> 29:13.680
So are you familiar with the application for Mac OS

29:13.680 --> 29:15.440
called Little Snitch?

29:15.440 --> 29:16.200
Oh, yeah.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.700
I think I've seen some people using that.

29:17.700 --> 29:18.200
Yeah.

29:18.200 --> 29:21.780
It's a handy little application that runs in the background,

29:21.780 --> 29:24.560
and it creates an outbound firewall.

29:24.560 --> 29:30.380
And it then gives the user some kind of notification,

29:30.380 --> 29:32.320
either through the native notification system

29:32.320 --> 29:34.800
or a custom notification dialogue,

29:34.800 --> 29:38.640
that X, Y, Z application, Chrome,

29:38.640 --> 29:42.200
is trying to connect outbound on this port to this address.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.640
Do you want to allow it?

29:43.640 --> 29:45.440
And one of the things that's interesting

29:45.440 --> 29:48.840
is, say, you have software that checks

29:48.840 --> 29:51.960
into some sort of remote server every time you launch it.

29:51.960 --> 29:54.160
You will discover it very quickly with applications

29:54.160 --> 29:56.200
like Little Snitch, and you'll discover, oh,

29:56.200 --> 29:58.760
every time I run Lightworks, it's checking in

29:58.760 --> 30:02.240
with edit share servers, for better or for worse.

30:02.240 --> 30:03.740
But it's nice to know it's happening.

30:03.740 --> 30:05.320
And you can also make the decision

30:05.320 --> 30:09.960
to allow it or block it with Little Snitch.

30:09.960 --> 30:12.000
And I've probably gotten, over the years,

30:12.000 --> 30:13.320
a handful of questions.

30:13.320 --> 30:16.360
Hey, is there anything like that for GNU slash Linux?

30:16.360 --> 30:17.660
Anybody got something like that?

30:17.660 --> 30:19.840
Because I would love to have something

30:19.840 --> 30:21.380
like that for GNU slash Linux.

30:21.380 --> 30:23.240
And I always say, get it out of here.

30:23.240 --> 30:23.840
Get it out of here.

30:23.840 --> 30:24.320
Right.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.740
You'll have to roll it yourself, get some IP tables,

30:26.740 --> 30:28.520
commands, and a whole bunch of scripting.

30:28.520 --> 30:29.160
Yeah, yeah.

30:29.160 --> 30:29.760
But you know what?

30:29.760 --> 30:31.140
We have an app pick for you this week.

30:31.140 --> 30:33.560
People have been saying, Chris, more app picks.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.160
Missed the app picks from Linux Action Show.

30:35.160 --> 30:35.920
Well, guess what?

30:35.920 --> 30:36.800
We've been slipping them in here.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.280
We just haven't been calling them app picks.

30:38.280 --> 30:40.360
But this week, we got two of them for you.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.960
And the first one is called OpenSnitch.

30:42.960 --> 30:47.520
OpenSnitch is a GNU slash Linux port of the Little Snitch

30:47.520 --> 30:49.160
application firewall.

30:49.160 --> 30:52.680
And just like its Mac cousin, it gives you

30:52.680 --> 30:55.960
a graphical notification saying, hey,

30:55.960 --> 30:59.280
Telnet is trying to connect out on ports blah, blah, blah

30:59.280 --> 31:01.880
to destination IP blah, blah, blah.

31:01.880 --> 31:03.840
Would you like to block this temporarily?

31:03.840 --> 31:05.440
Would you like to block this forever?

31:05.440 --> 31:06.960
Would you like to allow it?

31:06.960 --> 31:09.200
And the thing that's wonderful about this

31:09.200 --> 31:12.760
is you can just run it for short periods of time

31:12.760 --> 31:15.120
and get an idea of what your system is doing.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.880
And it's incredibly insightful.

31:16.880 --> 31:19.600
It, in my personal opinion, gets really obnoxious

31:19.600 --> 31:22.480
after a while because everything is going outbound these days.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.100
When Little Snitch was first conceived,

31:24.100 --> 31:26.400
not nearly as many things connected out to the internet.

31:26.400 --> 31:27.960
But it's still very useful.

31:27.960 --> 31:31.160
It's called OpenSnitch, OpenSnitch.io.

31:31.160 --> 31:32.760
And you're going to have to build it

31:32.760 --> 31:35.760
if you're on one of the more common distros except for Arch.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.640
Arch, there is an AUR entry.

31:37.640 --> 31:38.640
Surprise, surprise.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.400
But we're not talking anything major.

31:40.400 --> 31:46.040
They have the commands you can run to sudo apt install or DNF

31:46.040 --> 31:48.320
install the dependencies.

31:48.320 --> 31:51.160
And then it's really just a Python setup install.

31:51.160 --> 31:52.600
It's really not a big deal.

31:52.600 --> 31:55.600
So it's not like you're going to be spending all day getting

31:55.600 --> 31:57.600
the software built. And it is in the AUR

31:57.600 --> 32:00.400
if you want to just install OpenSnitch dash git.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.640
Anyways, OpenSnitch.d gets installed.

32:02.640 --> 32:05.760
And then there's a cute front end that talks to OpenSnitch.d.

32:05.760 --> 32:08.720
And then there's like a rule process.

32:08.720 --> 32:10.780
And it's kind of a nice system.

32:10.780 --> 32:12.240
It's an application level firewall,

32:12.240 --> 32:14.120
meaning it works while it's running.

32:14.120 --> 32:17.440
And it will detect and alert the user for every single outgoing

32:17.440 --> 32:19.800
connection that gets created, which is very nice.

32:19.800 --> 32:22.200
It can be extremely effective to detect and block

32:22.200 --> 32:25.960
unwanted connections, which is also really helpful when you're

32:25.960 --> 32:27.920
just in certain situations and scenarios.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.280
Maybe you're on a certain unknown network.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.480
Right, not trusted. Or you're just trying

32:30.480 --> 32:32.160
to evaluate some new software.

32:32.160 --> 32:37.840
And it's using underlying good standard Linux firewall stuff,

32:37.840 --> 32:40.620
like AP tables extensions or NFs or whatever

32:40.620 --> 32:41.960
you have on your system.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.680
It's not like it's some crazy homebrew firewall.

32:44.680 --> 32:45.680
Right, yeah, exactly.

32:45.680 --> 32:47.600
It's just using the stuff in the Linux kernel.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.180
And once a connection is detected,

32:49.180 --> 32:52.760
the software relies on ftrace kernel extensions

32:52.760 --> 32:55.640
to track which PID is causing the connection.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.800
So it can actually tell you which particular process

32:58.800 --> 33:01.360
on your Linux box is trying to make that outbound connection.

33:01.360 --> 33:01.860
Nice.

33:01.860 --> 33:03.680
Which is really great when something comes like,

33:03.680 --> 33:06.040
I didn't even know that was running in the background.

33:06.040 --> 33:07.680
So that's open snitch.

33:07.680 --> 33:10.200
And we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.780
And then, Wes, you found this one.

33:12.780 --> 33:14.780
And I figured, why would you want this?

33:14.780 --> 33:16.920
But then I remembered that Spotify actually

33:16.920 --> 33:21.160
has this feature where any Spotify client can control

33:21.160 --> 33:22.880
any other Spotify client on your account.

33:22.880 --> 33:26.200
And that's when this next app pick really clicked for me.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.720
It's Spotify D.

33:28.720 --> 33:33.640
An open source Spotify client that runs as a Unix demon.

33:33.640 --> 33:36.760
So just like regular Spotify, it's headless freaking Spotify.

33:36.760 --> 33:39.560
It streams music, just like the official client.

33:39.560 --> 33:40.640
But it's lightweight.

33:40.640 --> 33:44.240
Doesn't have that whole web UI wrapper around it.

33:44.240 --> 33:45.960
It supports the Spotify Connect protocol,

33:45.960 --> 33:48.120
which makes it just show up as any other Spotify

33:48.120 --> 33:50.400
device that you can control.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.960
The only downside is it does require a Spotify premium

33:52.960 --> 33:55.840
account, which I happen to have because we use it

33:55.840 --> 33:57.640
in the family quite a bit.

33:57.640 --> 34:00.000
I'm not a proud Spotify user.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.360
I actually hem and haw a little bit about putting this here

34:02.360 --> 34:04.720
because I know a lot of people are like, Spotify?

34:04.720 --> 34:05.920
You know what I like about Spotify, though?

34:05.920 --> 34:07.600
I always tell myself, they're streaming

34:07.600 --> 34:09.840
the music using Augworbus.

34:09.840 --> 34:14.440
So at least you can play it on Linux.

34:14.440 --> 34:16.440
And we're in kind of an awkward situation, right?

34:16.440 --> 34:17.360
We talk about Slack.

34:17.360 --> 34:18.760
We talk about other things.

34:18.760 --> 34:23.320
As much as we love and want to support open source software,

34:23.320 --> 34:24.600
we all get in our lives done.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.200
And sometimes that means running whatever

34:26.200 --> 34:27.120
you happen to already have.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.720
Or maybe you're sharing an account with your spouse

34:28.720 --> 34:29.800
or whatever else.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.320
I mean, the thing is not only do we

34:31.320 --> 34:34.440
have shared playlists, which is great,

34:34.440 --> 34:39.880
but I just don't care enough about music.

34:39.880 --> 34:45.120
Like when I first got a computer and CDs were still a thing,

34:45.120 --> 34:46.800
I curated a collection.

34:46.800 --> 34:50.160
And I was really OCD about all of my tag information.

34:50.160 --> 34:53.540
And I would rip complete albums and make sure all of the stuff

34:53.540 --> 34:55.920
and I'd run it through like, Music Brains Picard

34:55.920 --> 34:57.920
and all that kind of stuff to try to make it.

34:57.920 --> 35:01.340
Yeah, and then a couple of machine migrations,

35:01.340 --> 35:02.440
everything gets ruined.

35:02.440 --> 35:06.920
Or I'd try out, I'd install the new version of Rhythmbox,

35:06.920 --> 35:10.160
and it blanked out all of my ID3 tags one time.

35:10.160 --> 35:13.520
And I'm like, well, I'm never going to do that again.

35:13.520 --> 35:16.120
And I just sort of had to just divorce myself

35:16.120 --> 35:18.040
from caring about my music collection.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.920
And now I just embrace the streaming service.

35:19.920 --> 35:22.320
And honestly, if Spotify went out of business tomorrow,

35:22.320 --> 35:23.840
I would give zero shits.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.320
I would just sign up for something else.

35:25.320 --> 35:27.320
A different one.

35:27.320 --> 35:31.540
So it's with that kind of pragmatist mindset

35:31.540 --> 35:32.780
that I use Spotify.

35:32.780 --> 35:35.580
And so when you come at me with an open source Spotify

35:35.580 --> 35:37.240
headless client that I could potentially

35:37.240 --> 35:39.040
run here in the studio, I'm all about it.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.000
I think this is great.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.680
Yeah, especially if you already have like a media center

35:41.680 --> 35:44.080
machine that's hooked up to a sound system or otherwise,

35:44.080 --> 35:45.040
this would be perfect.

35:45.040 --> 35:46.280
Totally.

35:46.280 --> 35:47.040
Yeah, that's great.

35:47.040 --> 35:49.320
It does require the also packages get installed,

35:49.320 --> 35:50.440
which then talks to Pulse.

35:50.440 --> 35:53.240
But that's the typical shit show of Linux audio,

35:53.240 --> 35:54.680
not too surprising there.

35:54.680 --> 35:56.240
It also supports D-Bus, which means

35:56.240 --> 35:58.440
it can be controlled by some generic media playback

35:58.440 --> 36:03.000
controllers like Player CTL or your desktop environments

36:03.000 --> 36:06.640
that have like the playback controls in the volume slider,

36:06.640 --> 36:10.080
like modern desktops, still can control this sucker too.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.620
So you don't really need the Spotify.

36:11.620 --> 36:12.280
Wow.

36:12.280 --> 36:13.440
See, this is awesome.

36:13.440 --> 36:15.880
So this might be just the way I get Spotify from now on.

36:15.880 --> 36:18.080
And you may want to as well.

36:18.080 --> 36:20.440
You can find a link to that in the show notes.

36:20.440 --> 36:21.280
Yeah, that's true.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.720
Vera Tundis says in the chat room,

36:22.720 --> 36:25.400
she says, but Chris, that's what media servers are for, like MB.

36:25.400 --> 36:29.840
So I got an excuse for that too.

36:29.840 --> 36:34.160
I got all in on Sub Zero, I think it was, or Subsonic.

36:34.160 --> 36:35.200
Subsonic, yeah.

36:35.200 --> 36:37.600
And there was a whole bunch of shenanigans

36:37.600 --> 36:39.840
about them going commercial.

36:39.840 --> 36:42.480
And the project had a bunch of bad blood.

36:42.480 --> 36:45.040
And I paid for it on two separate occasions

36:45.040 --> 36:46.000
and got screwed.

36:46.000 --> 36:50.280
And so it's not a good enough reason, but I just gave up.

36:50.280 --> 36:53.120
I still manage my video collection

36:53.120 --> 36:57.000
like I used to manage my TV, or my music collection.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.600
I still manage my TV and my movies like that.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.840
I gave up on the music a long time ago.

37:01.840 --> 37:02.960
It's just a shame.

37:02.960 --> 37:05.280
It's especially hard with discovery and other things too.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.960
And the streaming services just make it so simple.

37:07.960 --> 37:08.840
Yeah, yeah.

37:08.840 --> 37:11.160
That's just, you sit down, especially with Android TV

37:11.160 --> 37:12.240
and stuff like that.

37:12.240 --> 37:12.760
I know.

37:12.760 --> 37:15.400
Anybody in the Mumble Room, the exact opposite,

37:15.400 --> 37:18.680
where you're super meticulous about your music library,

37:18.680 --> 37:21.520
you only listen to local audio.

37:21.520 --> 37:23.000
Angela's like that.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.560
Angela only listens to local.

37:24.560 --> 37:25.080
Is that right?

37:25.080 --> 37:25.560
No streaming.

37:25.560 --> 37:26.760
She's just local audio.

37:26.760 --> 37:29.960
She still sings it via the wire to her phone.

37:29.960 --> 37:32.000
Yeah, it's impressive, normally.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.680
What's that, Mini?

37:33.680 --> 37:36.720
I started to back up my whole CD collection, which

37:36.720 --> 37:39.280
is about 400 or 500 CDs.

37:39.280 --> 37:46.520
I have to flag a copy and then normally have 192 OGD copies

37:46.520 --> 37:49.080
for my phone and for my router.

37:49.080 --> 37:52.080
So when I'm at home, I stream via router.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.600
So that works great.

37:53.600 --> 37:58.520
What client are you using on Android to play Hogs?

37:58.520 --> 38:00.440
On Android, I don't have an Android phone.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.200
I use the Yola Sailfish phone.

38:02.200 --> 38:03.120
So there is no problem.

38:03.120 --> 38:04.680
OK, OK, all right.

38:04.680 --> 38:05.480
Nice.

38:05.480 --> 38:06.560
Nice answer, dude.

38:06.560 --> 38:07.760
Yeah.

38:07.760 --> 38:08.800
Shut Chris up right there.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.160
And I knew that too, when I think about it.

38:10.160 --> 38:10.640
I knew it.

38:10.640 --> 38:12.240
I never had that question.

38:12.240 --> 38:13.240
Is that true?

38:13.240 --> 38:15.840
Does Android don't have Android in OGD?

38:15.840 --> 38:17.640
No, I mean, there's like VLC and whatnot.

38:17.640 --> 38:18.880
That should be default now.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.200
I don't know.

38:20.200 --> 38:22.240
The open source music media player, I don't think,

38:22.240 --> 38:24.680
is even the default anymore.

38:24.680 --> 38:27.560
But I have a dozen different apps that will play Hogs.

38:27.560 --> 38:29.080
But I don't like any of them enough

38:29.080 --> 38:32.040
to listen to all my music that way.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.240
Isn't it interesting that it's hard to find

38:34.240 --> 38:36.160
a really good music player?

38:36.160 --> 38:38.700
I mean, there are thousands for Linux boxes,

38:38.700 --> 38:40.040
but a really good one?

38:40.040 --> 38:43.520
I found Lollipop for GDK Gno, which is cool.

38:43.520 --> 38:46.080
CMOS on the terminal is great.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.280
But otherwise, it's really hard to find

38:48.280 --> 38:51.360
really cool, good music players.

38:51.360 --> 38:54.360
I mean, most of us are satisfied with the results of VLC,

38:54.360 --> 38:55.080
I guess.

38:55.080 --> 38:56.760
But what if you have a large collection?

38:56.760 --> 38:59.320
See, that's one of the other reasons I end up using Spotify,

38:59.320 --> 39:05.360
is because it's also a jukebox, like of the old style jukebox.

39:05.360 --> 39:07.760
You know, you guys all know Arm Rock.

39:07.760 --> 39:11.160
Just like after years, just after years,

39:11.160 --> 39:13.160
just released a new version recently.

39:13.160 --> 39:14.200
I didn't, I missed that.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.320
Yeah, I don't know if it's a beta or what, but yeah.

39:16.320 --> 39:17.680
So it's still a thing.

39:17.680 --> 39:21.880
But I think with SSDs too, and a lot of my main machines

39:21.880 --> 39:23.640
are laptops these days, I just don't

39:23.640 --> 39:27.200
have a lot of room for gigabytes and gigabytes of music.

39:27.200 --> 39:31.640
If I had unlimited budget, unlimited time,

39:31.640 --> 39:33.680
I would prefer to have everything in Flax.

39:33.680 --> 39:35.200
And I would prefer to have it all local.

39:35.200 --> 39:38.200
Anyway, Spotify D, we'll have a link up on the show notes.

39:38.200 --> 39:41.540
You know, if you want to give us an app, or a story,

39:41.540 --> 39:43.600
or a project that you think we should know about,

39:43.600 --> 39:44.720
hit us up on the subreddit.

39:44.720 --> 39:47.800
It's still going, linuxunplugged.reddit.com,

39:47.800 --> 39:49.640
linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

39:49.640 --> 39:53.160
And in the next, I'm not sure what the scheduling is,

39:53.160 --> 39:55.480
but it's very soon there's going to be back end

39:55.480 --> 39:57.880
changes for the RSS feeds and stuff like that

39:57.880 --> 40:00.760
coming to this show, because we're doing a whole project.

40:00.760 --> 40:02.840
We've got a whole project coming up.

40:02.840 --> 40:07.880
And this show is going to be rolled up into all of that.

40:07.880 --> 40:09.800
I don't think you'll have to do anything.

40:09.800 --> 40:12.880
I guess the one thing I would say is if, by accident,

40:12.880 --> 40:15.440
when we forward the RSS feed, if we trigger an extra download

40:15.440 --> 40:17.120
or something like that, I apologize.

40:17.120 --> 40:17.880
We're sorry.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.120
Here's what I do expect to have happen.

40:20.120 --> 40:23.520
This is why I'm giving you the heads up.

40:23.520 --> 40:26.760
There will be a cleaning of the feeds

40:26.760 --> 40:29.000
simply because we're switching feed services.

40:29.000 --> 40:29.960
That's one of the things we're doing,

40:29.960 --> 40:31.760
is we're migrating off a feed burner, which

40:31.760 --> 40:34.280
is sort of like this zombie Google service.

40:34.280 --> 40:37.360
And we're moving to a small shop that

40:37.360 --> 40:42.040
is dedicated to hosting podcast RSS feeds called FeedPress.

40:42.040 --> 40:46.560
And we're going to have a cool new URLs, too.

40:46.560 --> 40:47.560
So check this out.

40:47.560 --> 40:49.360
If you go to, they're not all set up,

40:49.360 --> 40:54.200
but this one is feed.jupiter.zone

40:54.200 --> 40:56.560
slash allshows.

40:56.560 --> 40:59.000
That is the allshows RSS feed.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.400
So we're going to have a new domain for all of our feeds,

41:01.400 --> 41:04.400
feed.jupiter.zone and then slash feed name.

41:04.400 --> 41:10.320
So it'll be like allshows, lup, super easy stuff.

41:10.320 --> 41:15.120
And the issue with that is that migration process

41:15.120 --> 41:16.840
is not super clean.

41:16.840 --> 41:19.860
I can forward, I can do like a redirect.

41:19.860 --> 41:21.520
I can redirect people to the new feed,

41:21.520 --> 41:25.080
but I can't import the old items.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.920
Incompatible.

41:26.920 --> 41:33.400
So if you are an archivist, you got a few days, maybe,

41:33.400 --> 41:35.120
to try to pull everything down in the feed.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.880
That's your warning, because it'll be a reset clean feed,

41:37.880 --> 41:39.340
then they'll be updated from there,

41:39.340 --> 41:41.760
but there's going to be a clean break when

41:41.760 --> 41:43.080
we move to the new feed service.

41:43.080 --> 41:46.440
You won't have to resub, because I'll do a redirect at the URL

41:46.440 --> 41:51.880
level, but the actual items in the RSS feed will be reset.

41:51.880 --> 41:55.280
And that also will prevent triggering redownloads, too.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.240
So it's also a good thing.

41:57.240 --> 41:58.480
So yeah, that's your public.

41:58.480 --> 42:00.240
But be prepared for changes.

42:00.240 --> 42:01.880
Yeah, be prepared.

42:01.880 --> 42:04.000
Also, just keep an eye out for that kind of stuff.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.640
Just a general Linux Unplugged service

42:06.640 --> 42:11.560
announcement for your better podcast experience.

42:11.560 --> 42:14.240
Now, I did just get back from scale.

42:14.240 --> 42:20.160
And like I said in the intro, I got a lot of clips, over 170,

42:20.160 --> 42:22.440
and talked to a lot of people.

42:22.440 --> 42:24.960
But I knew when I came back from scale this year

42:24.960 --> 42:29.760
that I really wanted to just do the best job possible,

42:29.760 --> 42:32.080
just giving you what you need to know about the event,

42:32.080 --> 42:34.880
and not overdoing it with 15 interviews,

42:34.880 --> 42:36.600
and multiple episodes, and all of that,

42:36.600 --> 42:37.920
like not bogging down the show with it.

42:37.920 --> 42:39.120
It's harder to do than it sounds like,

42:39.120 --> 42:41.080
because there's so much going on at scale.

42:41.080 --> 42:44.280
And so I got there on Thursday.

42:44.280 --> 42:46.600
I got there Wednesday, but the scale starts Thursday,

42:46.600 --> 42:48.520
and it goes till Sunday.

42:48.520 --> 42:50.920
And there's stuff going on all day, every day.

42:50.920 --> 42:53.440
And you're learning and meeting people every single day.

42:53.440 --> 42:56.280
Plus, it's a multi-thousand dollar investment for us,

42:56.280 --> 42:58.400
cost-wise, as a company, to go down there.

42:58.400 --> 43:01.240
Noah's down there, and he's taking time off of AltaSpeed,

43:01.240 --> 43:03.400
so it's a personal investment for him, too.

43:03.400 --> 43:09.880
And so you have this drive to come back and just make

43:09.880 --> 43:10.960
it all scale all the time.

43:10.960 --> 43:15.040
Because we've spent a lot of energy and time in this.

43:15.040 --> 43:17.980
But this trip was really the trip

43:17.980 --> 43:23.120
where I internalized why I go to these things.

43:23.120 --> 43:26.360
And it wasn't about the pressure of making a show out of it.

43:26.360 --> 43:29.720
It was about going there, talking to people,

43:29.720 --> 43:32.640
learning, getting insights from the audience,

43:32.640 --> 43:36.720
figuring out new things to look into, meeting new companies.

43:36.720 --> 43:38.800
That's why I went, not to come back

43:38.800 --> 43:41.040
with all of these interviews about the latest, craziest

43:41.040 --> 43:42.800
things that I saw on the expo floor.

43:42.800 --> 43:45.920
But I did pick one.

43:45.920 --> 43:49.480
I did pick one interview that I wanted to play for you guys,

43:49.480 --> 43:55.880
because it's from someone who has been doing this

43:55.880 --> 43:57.040
for quite a while.

43:57.040 --> 43:58.960
He is one of the co-founders.

43:58.960 --> 44:01.040
He's the Scale Conference chair.

44:01.040 --> 44:06.480
Elon is a longtime member of this community.

44:06.480 --> 44:08.320
And he works at Datadog.

44:08.320 --> 44:11.780
He is, as he puts it, a recovering sys admin.

44:11.780 --> 44:14.200
And he had some interesting things to say.

44:14.200 --> 44:16.160
So I did pull that interview.

44:16.160 --> 44:18.320
I sat down with him at the expo floor

44:18.320 --> 44:19.840
while he was in the thick of things

44:19.840 --> 44:21.520
and just did a brain dump with him.

44:21.520 --> 44:23.320
And I wanted to play a little bit of that, a little bit

44:23.320 --> 44:25.480
of the expo floor for you, just to sort of cap off

44:25.480 --> 44:26.480
my trip to scale.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.720
So before we get there, I want to thank Linux Academy

44:28.720 --> 44:31.920
for sponsoring the show and making what we do possible

44:31.920 --> 44:34.920
and for creating a platform to help Linux users learn more

44:34.920 --> 44:36.440
about Linux.

44:36.440 --> 44:38.800
It's a way to get access to advanced training tools

44:38.800 --> 44:42.200
that increase your skills and encourage critical thinking

44:42.200 --> 44:45.440
around everything related to Linux, a full-featured training

44:45.440 --> 44:47.680
library with everything you need to know,

44:47.680 --> 44:50.240
with full-time human beings that are available to help.

44:50.240 --> 44:53.880
And one of my favorite features is real, hands-on labs

44:53.880 --> 44:55.800
and exercises.

44:55.800 --> 44:57.920
They deploy real environments, and then you

44:57.920 --> 45:01.160
take scenario-based labs on them, hands-ons,

45:01.160 --> 45:03.560
from anywheres at any times.

45:03.560 --> 45:05.160
Hands-on scenario-based labs give you

45:05.160 --> 45:07.480
experience on real environments that Linux Academy has

45:07.480 --> 45:08.760
curated for you.

45:08.760 --> 45:13.280
And that is huge for me because I genuinely learn by doing.

45:13.280 --> 45:15.600
Yeah, sometimes you can't supplant that.

45:15.600 --> 45:17.760
You can answer all the multiple choice questions you want,

45:17.760 --> 45:19.360
but if you haven't been on that server.

45:19.360 --> 45:20.760
And I can't test.

45:20.760 --> 45:23.160
I can't test unless I've done it and I've seen it.

45:23.160 --> 45:24.240
I cannot test.

45:24.240 --> 45:26.200
There's no exam I'm passing.

45:26.200 --> 45:29.840
And I say that having learned that the really hard and

45:29.840 --> 45:31.160
expensive way a couple of times.

45:31.160 --> 45:33.160
And that was just something I learned about myself.

45:33.160 --> 45:34.040
And that's one of the things I really

45:34.040 --> 45:36.400
appreciate about Linux Academy is it's built around that.

45:36.400 --> 45:39.440
But even more importantly, it's built for your busy, busy life.

45:39.440 --> 45:41.560
You can pick a course and set a time frame,

45:41.560 --> 45:44.120
and it'll fit your schedule and your learning goals.

45:44.120 --> 45:45.600
They have practice exams and quizzes

45:45.600 --> 45:48.080
to help you prep for when you're going to go take that test.

45:48.080 --> 45:50.600
And they have a community that's full of Jupyter broadcasting

45:50.600 --> 45:53.800
that are forking, customizing, and randomizing study flash

45:53.800 --> 45:55.760
cards to help you up your game.

45:55.760 --> 45:58.240
And then they have study tools that you can download offline

45:58.240 --> 45:58.760
and listen to.

45:58.760 --> 46:00.480
So if you're like Eric and I and you're

46:00.480 --> 46:02.240
in a bandwidth limited environment,

46:02.240 --> 46:03.640
they can accommodate that too.

46:03.640 --> 46:05.560
And if you're on the go, maybe you're in the tube

46:05.560 --> 46:07.640
and you got some downtime while you're commuting,

46:07.640 --> 46:09.480
they got iOS and Android apps as well.

46:09.480 --> 46:10.680
It's pretty great.

46:10.680 --> 46:12.680
In fact, you might say it's the best.

46:12.680 --> 46:15.440
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

46:15.440 --> 46:17.000
Go there, support the show, and sign up

46:17.000 --> 46:18.760
for a free seven day trial.

46:18.760 --> 46:21.680
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

46:21.680 --> 46:23.600
Dooblaloo, dooblaloo, dooblaloo.

46:23.600 --> 46:25.560
So yeah, let's go to scale.

46:25.560 --> 46:28.800
You want to go back to California about a week ago?

46:28.800 --> 46:30.320
Let's teleport, get right there.

46:30.320 --> 46:32.560
Much faster than going by RV, right?

46:32.560 --> 46:34.960
Can we still take Levi?

46:34.960 --> 46:36.200
We're definitely taking Levi.

46:36.200 --> 46:37.200
You have to take Levi.

46:37.200 --> 46:38.840
He's the tour guide.

46:38.840 --> 46:40.880
There was something that Scale has done,

46:40.880 --> 46:42.420
and they really refined it this year.

46:42.420 --> 46:44.760
It's not their first crack at it.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.320
But if you're going to scale, I think

46:46.320 --> 46:48.520
it's one of the things you might really like

46:48.520 --> 46:50.000
is they have these track sessions.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.960
So Ubicon, for example, was a track.

46:51.960 --> 46:53.680
It's all Ubuntu all the time.

46:53.680 --> 46:55.360
And then there was several other tracks.

46:55.360 --> 46:59.600
Like one of the more popular ones was the Postgres track

46:59.600 --> 47:02.280
for people that just wanted to implement and deploy Postgres

47:02.280 --> 47:05.520
in their day-to-day work lives.

47:05.520 --> 47:07.120
And so the goal here with partitioning

47:07.120 --> 47:10.440
is sort of without having to do a lot of changes,

47:10.440 --> 47:13.600
you can implement this within Postgres on the same system,

47:13.600 --> 47:14.960
and then get a lot of benefits.

47:14.960 --> 47:17.120
One of the tracks that was going on all day yesterday

47:17.120 --> 47:18.840
and appears to be going on all day today

47:18.840 --> 47:21.720
is people that are trying to get work done with PostSQL,

47:21.720 --> 47:22.800
Postgres.

47:22.800 --> 47:25.600
And so this one is like a performance track.

47:25.600 --> 47:29.160
And this room, room 106, will be about Postgres all day long.

47:29.160 --> 47:31.040
The other one that really blew my mind,

47:31.040 --> 47:33.240
Noah and I specifically wanted to go out and see

47:33.240 --> 47:37.480
how deep can we go into the under-workings of Linux.

47:37.480 --> 47:41.920
And so we set out to find the USB subsystems track.

47:41.920 --> 47:44.440
So the question is, is there a one-to-one core session?

47:44.440 --> 47:46.360
That's like a hardcore session in there.

47:46.360 --> 47:49.200
People are following along on their laptops with the slides.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.320
It's like down to details.

47:50.320 --> 47:52.880
Yeah, it's, yeah.

47:52.880 --> 47:54.840
Like, I started to get a little overwhelmed

47:54.840 --> 47:56.000
within a couple of minutes.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.760
But it's fascinating, too, like the kind of stuff

47:57.760 --> 47:58.880
they have to worry about.

47:58.880 --> 48:00.000
It's a room full of people trying

48:00.000 --> 48:02.200
to figure out how to make accessories on Linux.

48:02.200 --> 48:04.360
And I'm glad there's people doing that so that people

48:04.360 --> 48:05.600
like you and me don't have to.

48:05.600 --> 48:06.120
No kidding.

48:06.120 --> 48:08.160
And you heard in the background, there's babies there.

48:08.160 --> 48:09.160
There's families there.

48:09.160 --> 48:10.480
There's even dogs there.

48:10.480 --> 48:12.640
They said, you know, we could probably get Levi a pass.

48:12.640 --> 48:13.440
That's amazing.

48:13.440 --> 48:15.360
It really was pretty great.

48:15.360 --> 48:17.720
But Levi had other things to do that day.

48:17.720 --> 48:20.800
And you get the sense that you could go there and really

48:20.800 --> 48:24.480
sort of walk away with knowledge to ship something.

48:24.480 --> 48:27.240
Like, that USB subsystem one really went deep into like,

48:27.240 --> 48:28.780
here's how you troubleshoot when you're

48:28.780 --> 48:30.960
trying to build a product and you need it to identify itself

48:30.960 --> 48:31.920
to the Linux subsystem.

48:31.920 --> 48:33.760
Like, here's some of the things you can look into

48:33.760 --> 48:34.920
if this isn't working for you.

48:34.920 --> 48:37.080
Like, really like stuff you walk away with.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.160
Actual practical tips that you're going to need.

48:39.160 --> 48:41.480
Quote unquote, actionable items, if you will.

48:41.480 --> 48:43.760
But of course, one of my favorite things

48:43.760 --> 48:46.320
of any conference we ever go to, because the energy's always

48:46.320 --> 48:48.680
high and people always have their best foot forward,

48:48.680 --> 48:50.480
is the Expo Hall.

48:50.480 --> 48:52.960
And Noah and I are walking around with our media badges.

48:52.960 --> 48:54.880
So we got to go in a little early.

48:57.560 --> 48:59.520
You can hear them vacuuming the carpet now.

48:59.520 --> 49:02.400
They're still getting everything ready.

49:02.400 --> 49:04.360
We were able to sneak in as media a little early

49:04.360 --> 49:06.640
before the crowds in here.

49:06.640 --> 49:07.920
And it's still this noisy in here.

49:07.920 --> 49:09.800
Yeah.

49:09.800 --> 49:12.760
Yeah, there's the Ubuntu booth next to Chef.

49:12.760 --> 49:14.040
Howdy, howdy.

49:14.040 --> 49:15.640
Now, this is more my speed.

49:15.640 --> 49:17.640
We got a Videoland booth, Datadog.

49:17.640 --> 49:20.000
I've been wanting to talk to Datadog.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.680
This is nice.

49:21.680 --> 49:23.800
The Expo Hall at scale is always really fantastic.

49:23.800 --> 49:25.560
And it looks like they've spread it back out again a little bit

49:25.560 --> 49:26.720
from what it was last year.

49:26.720 --> 49:27.280
There's Fedora.

49:27.280 --> 49:28.240
Hey, Fedora.

49:28.240 --> 49:29.760
Fedora's looking good.

49:29.760 --> 49:30.880
Fedora has a booth.

49:30.880 --> 49:32.160
Adobe has a booth.

49:32.160 --> 49:33.640
Ubuntu has a booth.

49:33.640 --> 49:34.640
Yeah, really nice.

49:34.640 --> 49:38.200
Microsoft had a hell of a booth with Surface tablets there

49:38.200 --> 49:41.120
and lights everywhere and nice chairs.

49:41.120 --> 49:44.560
Git had a booth, like lots of folks have booths.

49:44.560 --> 49:49.400
And then lots of companies that I didn't even recognize

49:49.400 --> 49:50.280
had booths.

49:50.280 --> 49:52.120
It's interesting how many of these company names

49:52.120 --> 49:54.120
I don't even recognize.

49:54.120 --> 49:56.680
I think a handful of these companies

49:56.680 --> 49:59.960
did not exist two years ago at scale.

49:59.960 --> 50:00.680
Oh, yeah?

50:00.680 --> 50:06.320
I mean, do you recognize some of these, like TwitSlock,

50:06.320 --> 50:09.080
Skilly Dab, Tindy?

50:09.080 --> 50:11.040
I recognize GumGum.

50:11.040 --> 50:13.080
GoBot, Uncoded.

50:13.080 --> 50:14.720
I don't recognize these companies.

50:14.720 --> 50:16.120
I cover this stuff every day and I don't recognize

50:16.120 --> 50:16.560
these companies.

50:16.560 --> 50:18.520
It's like they've just come up out of nowhere

50:18.520 --> 50:20.640
based on some of the technology that's in Linux now.

50:20.640 --> 50:23.440
Yeah, I think there's a lot of startup companies

50:23.440 --> 50:26.680
and a lot of venture capitalist money that's coming around,

50:26.680 --> 50:28.160
people trying to get off the ground.

50:28.160 --> 50:29.720
Well, you just put it in a container

50:29.720 --> 50:31.200
and you can get funded.

50:31.200 --> 50:33.760
You know, we're joking about it, but that's kind of the reality

50:33.760 --> 50:35.600
is that some of the recent advancements

50:35.600 --> 50:39.080
that we've covered just as just topics of conversation

50:39.080 --> 50:42.400
in this show are now fundamental building blocks

50:42.400 --> 50:45.200
for entire businesses that are like getting VC funding

50:45.200 --> 50:46.600
and have a business model.

50:46.600 --> 50:50.280
And they're using namespaces in the Linux kernel, right?

50:50.280 --> 50:51.960
And it's not to say they're not legitimate

50:51.960 --> 50:53.760
because they are solving, in some cases,

50:53.760 --> 50:55.480
real business needs.

50:55.480 --> 50:57.280
It's just crazy walking around and seeing

50:57.280 --> 50:58.920
all these companies that don't even recognize the name

50:58.920 --> 51:01.360
because traditionally, going to these conferences

51:01.360 --> 51:04.160
for many years now, I've been going to these things

51:04.160 --> 51:07.720
even before JB when I was in high school, I started going.

51:07.720 --> 51:10.640
And that was an unfortunate long time ago.

51:10.640 --> 51:12.200
That was a while ago.

51:12.200 --> 51:15.200
And back in the day, it was a much more limited spread.

51:15.200 --> 51:16.240
You had some big names.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.840
You had the people you expected to see.

51:17.840 --> 51:19.320
Well, that's just it.

51:19.320 --> 51:21.360
So that was 18, 19 years ago.

51:21.360 --> 51:26.360
And through that time, really until just the last few years,

51:26.680 --> 51:27.920
it was company names you already knew.

51:27.920 --> 51:29.720
Every single company name you already knew.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.360
Now it's a whole bunch of new companies

51:31.360 --> 51:32.600
that are even possible.

51:32.600 --> 51:34.920
They're like micro companies because of the technology

51:34.920 --> 51:36.120
that they're based on.

51:36.120 --> 51:38.200
So we were walking around the floor

51:38.200 --> 51:40.360
and we bumped into Elon,

51:40.360 --> 51:43.760
who is one of the co-chairs of Scale.

51:43.760 --> 51:45.080
Elon Rubinovich.

51:45.080 --> 51:46.680
So I'm the conference chair for Scale

51:46.680 --> 51:48.600
and one of the co-founders.

51:48.600 --> 51:50.680
And I had a lot of things to talk to him about.

51:50.680 --> 51:52.440
We had a long-ranging conversation

51:52.440 --> 51:55.920
from where he thinks Linux is going in 2018.

51:55.920 --> 51:58.720
And I got the sense, he said something to me that struck me

51:58.720 --> 52:00.320
and that's what led to my next question.

52:00.320 --> 52:03.600
And he said, the core team of us here at Scale,

52:03.600 --> 52:08.240
we take vacation at work so that way we can go to work

52:08.240 --> 52:10.320
and work harder than we even work.

52:10.320 --> 52:11.160
Right.

52:11.160 --> 52:13.440
And I'm watching him run around

52:13.440 --> 52:14.680
and I'm looking at his schedule

52:14.680 --> 52:16.800
and in one hour from our conversation,

52:16.800 --> 52:18.240
the Expo Hall opens up.

52:18.240 --> 52:19.640
One hour immediately after that,

52:19.640 --> 52:21.680
they need to be out there taking the wrap off of the food

52:21.680 --> 52:23.020
that's in the middle of the Expo Hall.

52:23.020 --> 52:24.720
One hour after that, he needs to make sure

52:24.720 --> 52:27.240
that the event in the D room is so,

52:27.240 --> 52:30.120
like he just has like all of this stuff he's doing.

52:30.120 --> 52:31.840
Plus he was emailing back and forth

52:31.840 --> 52:34.200
with all of these companies, including Jupiter Broadcasting

52:34.200 --> 52:36.300
months before the event even kicks off,

52:36.300 --> 52:39.200
which he's doing on his own personal time.

52:39.200 --> 52:41.360
And he doesn't take a profit from any of this.

52:41.360 --> 52:42.920
He doesn't make a buck off this thing.

52:42.920 --> 52:44.520
I mean, he gets community stature

52:44.520 --> 52:46.440
and he gets connections and networking.

52:46.440 --> 52:47.880
But at the end of the day, he's doing it

52:47.880 --> 52:49.360
because he wants to and he loves it.

52:49.360 --> 52:50.280
Like that's very impressive.

52:50.280 --> 52:51.120
I'm like, is it that?

52:51.120 --> 52:51.960
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

52:51.960 --> 52:52.780
Like, so what is it?

52:52.780 --> 52:53.620
What drives you?

52:53.620 --> 52:57.040
Is this your contribution to open source instead of code?

52:57.040 --> 53:01.200
So yeah, a lot of us are where we are in our careers

53:01.200 --> 53:04.160
because of where open source,

53:04.160 --> 53:05.640
because of how we were involved in open source

53:05.640 --> 53:06.480
in the early days.

53:06.480 --> 53:08.560
You know, my first time I needed Linux,

53:08.560 --> 53:10.120
we needed to share a home internet connection.

53:10.120 --> 53:11.400
And I was like, oh, somebody told me

53:11.400 --> 53:13.960
about this IP tables thing and IP chains, sorry,

53:13.960 --> 53:16.820
at the time and went to a local lug

53:16.820 --> 53:19.320
and got help from some, made a bunch of friends

53:19.320 --> 53:20.640
and they helped me at an install fest

53:20.640 --> 53:23.200
to like getting started in open source and Linux, right?

53:23.200 --> 53:25.000
And that was amazing.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.180
And then over the years I thought, well, how do I,

53:27.180 --> 53:28.120
you know, how do I give back?

53:28.120 --> 53:30.240
That like really kicked off my career

53:30.240 --> 53:32.280
and the career of a lot of folks here.

53:32.280 --> 53:34.620
And so being involved in community activities like this

53:34.620 --> 53:35.960
is one way of giving back.

53:35.960 --> 53:39.740
So whether it's the kids track that we run on Saturdays

53:39.740 --> 53:42.680
where we have folks from six all the way up to 18

53:42.680 --> 53:44.640
giving talks about how they use Linux at open source

53:44.640 --> 53:47.800
and start to get the next generation excited about STEM.

53:47.800 --> 53:52.120
Or it's the install, like we have a Linux new user,

53:52.120 --> 53:54.160
Linux training that's a full day session

53:54.160 --> 53:56.120
where you come in at the start of the day with a,

53:56.120 --> 54:00.320
basically it's a more organized install fest

54:00.320 --> 54:02.960
and we take you through, get your systems installed,

54:02.960 --> 54:03.940
train you all the way up,

54:03.940 --> 54:05.560
or even just the regular talks that we have.

54:05.560 --> 54:07.880
Like all of these are ways that people can get

54:07.880 --> 54:09.400
trained up on Linux and open source

54:09.400 --> 54:10.900
and further their own career.

54:10.900 --> 54:13.240
We have a very popular jobs board and jobs bop

54:13.240 --> 54:15.580
and you look around the room and most of the companies

54:15.580 --> 54:17.240
are recruiting in some way or another.

54:17.240 --> 54:20.040
So yeah, I think this is definitely a way to give back.

54:21.500 --> 54:23.680
I would say, I would also say that participation

54:23.680 --> 54:25.880
in open source is done, whether it's with scale

54:25.880 --> 54:28.840
or with other things has been very, very kind to me.

54:28.840 --> 54:31.240
Maybe I don't, you know, I don't take a salary

54:31.240 --> 54:33.400
from anything we do around scale or Texas Linux Fest

54:33.400 --> 54:34.980
or the other groups I'm involved with.

54:34.980 --> 54:36.500
But I would say, I don't think I would have,

54:36.500 --> 54:40.600
I've had any of my last two jobs if it wasn't for,

54:40.600 --> 54:43.040
you know, having done, having built the skills

54:43.040 --> 54:45.820
and the connections that I get to make

54:45.820 --> 54:48.120
as part of running something like this, so.

54:48.120 --> 54:49.880
And they really do hustle.

54:49.880 --> 54:51.820
That he mentioned in there really briefly,

54:51.820 --> 54:53.260
the birds of a feather session.

54:53.260 --> 54:57.440
These boffs are also something that has become

54:57.440 --> 55:00.800
a more and more common element of these events.

55:00.800 --> 55:03.840
I really started seeing them become a common element

55:03.840 --> 55:05.500
in the BSD meetups.

55:05.500 --> 55:07.340
The BSD community started doing these

55:07.340 --> 55:10.300
and I saw it kind of quickly spread from there

55:10.300 --> 55:12.200
to the Linux community and one of the places I saw it

55:12.200 --> 55:14.240
actually come from BSD to the Linux community

55:14.240 --> 55:16.720
was at Linux Fest Northwest, surprisingly enough.

55:16.720 --> 55:18.520
And now almost all of these events

55:18.520 --> 55:19.680
are doing these boff sessions.

55:19.680 --> 55:21.920
And it's, the idea is, I'll give you an example.

55:21.920 --> 55:24.960
So you might know Randall Schwartz from Floss Weekly

55:24.960 --> 55:25.860
on the Twit network.

55:25.860 --> 55:28.000
He's there and he and I were chatting

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
and we were talking about what else but Perl and Dart.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.720
And so we started going back and forth about Perl and Dart

55:33.720 --> 55:34.800
and he started saying, yeah, you know what I'm doing

55:34.800 --> 55:37.040
is I'm doing a birds of feather session on Dart.

55:37.040 --> 55:38.440
So if you want to learn more, just come here

55:38.440 --> 55:39.920
and we're just other people that are working on Dart.

55:39.920 --> 55:41.360
We're just getting together and we're just hanging out

55:41.360 --> 55:42.200
and talking about Dart.

55:42.200 --> 55:44.440
And they sit around for two hours and they build stuff

55:44.440 --> 55:46.420
and they fix stuff and they debate stuff

55:46.420 --> 55:49.040
and these are becoming more and more common.

55:49.040 --> 55:52.160
And they're kind of a cool unplanned aspect

55:52.160 --> 55:54.320
that's sort of organically grown up in these conferences

55:54.320 --> 55:56.320
that don't require like somebody to put together

55:56.320 --> 55:59.820
a whole stack of presentations and propose a letter

55:59.820 --> 56:01.380
where they recommend what they want to talk,

56:01.380 --> 56:02.800
where they suggest what they want to talk about

56:02.800 --> 56:03.800
and get accepted.

56:03.800 --> 56:04.640
It's just simple.

56:04.640 --> 56:05.720
Low maintenance, easy going.

56:05.720 --> 56:07.640
And you probably find people who are actually

56:07.640 --> 56:08.480
just as passionate.

56:08.480 --> 56:10.040
There's so much to like at these conferences.

56:10.040 --> 56:11.620
You can find zero in on some people

56:11.620 --> 56:13.680
who are excited about what you are.

56:13.680 --> 56:15.680
Yeah, so it was nice to go.

56:15.680 --> 56:16.520
I'm glad we went.

56:16.520 --> 56:19.000
It also makes me look forward to Linux Fest Northwest

56:19.000 --> 56:19.840
where we'll be there.

56:19.840 --> 56:21.620
We're thinking about maybe trying to do a live show

56:21.620 --> 56:22.460
from there.

56:22.460 --> 56:26.020
We're kind of getting all that kind of worked out still.

56:26.020 --> 56:28.380
But yeah, I really had a great time

56:28.380 --> 56:30.480
and it did seem like they were definitely

56:30.480 --> 56:32.440
trying to make a contribution back to open source

56:32.440 --> 56:33.600
doing that.

56:33.600 --> 56:35.880
So many things, so many events to go to every year.

56:35.880 --> 56:37.360
And I understand not everybody can go

56:37.360 --> 56:40.080
and not everybody has an excuse to go like I do.

56:40.080 --> 56:42.920
But if you can make it, it will sort of change,

56:42.920 --> 56:43.760
it'll change you a little bit.

56:43.760 --> 56:46.280
It really reifies what the community is.

56:46.280 --> 56:48.880
We spend so much time on all these open source apps

56:48.880 --> 56:50.640
around IRC and all of that's awesome.

56:50.640 --> 56:52.320
But seeing people face to face

56:52.320 --> 56:53.920
and getting the sense of just how excited they are

56:53.920 --> 56:56.880
and how nice everyone is, it's totally different.

56:56.880 --> 56:57.720
Yeah, yeah.

56:57.720 --> 56:59.660
Putting a face to the disembodied voice.

56:59.660 --> 57:00.500
There we go.

57:00.500 --> 57:01.320
Yeah, it is.

57:01.320 --> 57:04.420
You know, it is like you get to check in with people.

57:04.420 --> 57:06.380
Like, you know, William's often in the mumble room

57:06.380 --> 57:07.220
and William was there.

57:07.220 --> 57:08.300
So we got to hang out with William.

57:08.300 --> 57:09.920
He got to hang out with Levi.

57:09.920 --> 57:11.080
William got to hang out with Levi as well.

57:11.080 --> 57:11.920
That's awesome.

57:11.920 --> 57:14.160
Yeah, he was Levi approved as a matter of fact.

57:14.160 --> 57:15.320
So that's always pretty good, you know,

57:15.320 --> 57:17.960
put names to faces like Geek Dad in the chat room.

57:17.960 --> 57:20.720
And yeah, and it just is, it's a rare chance

57:20.720 --> 57:22.320
to get to talk to a bunch of like-minded folks

57:22.320 --> 57:24.400
about stuff that everybody's really excited about.

57:24.400 --> 57:27.440
And you get to do it without the internet drama

57:27.440 --> 57:30.600
or the internet angst that all conversations

57:30.600 --> 57:32.520
seem to have now online.

57:32.520 --> 57:35.040
Now all of that's gone when you meet somebody in person.

57:35.040 --> 57:37.400
You know, like my favorite story I've shared it before

57:37.400 --> 57:41.600
is Ryan who, tech helper, he's known as tech helper.

57:41.600 --> 57:46.600
And he was not my biggest fan initially.

57:46.600 --> 57:50.840
And we met up in person and we became friends.

57:50.840 --> 57:54.040
And two years ago, he let me borrow his Cadillac

57:54.040 --> 57:55.240
when we went to scale.

57:55.240 --> 57:56.520
So that way I had transportation

57:56.520 --> 57:58.760
because I brought Lady Joops

57:58.760 --> 58:01.080
and I had to park it away from the conference.

58:01.080 --> 58:03.760
And this year, just without even asking him,

58:03.760 --> 58:05.280
because I was just crazy busy.

58:05.280 --> 58:08.120
I was doing all this stuff without even saying a word.

58:08.120 --> 58:09.800
The guy sends me a telegram out of the blue and says,

58:09.800 --> 58:12.400
hey, would you like to borrow my car again?

58:12.400 --> 58:13.240
That's wild.

58:13.240 --> 58:15.120
And it's like, you know, go from somebody who's like,

58:15.120 --> 58:16.680
yeah, kind of a troll to now like,

58:16.680 --> 58:17.760
hey, would you like to borrow my car?

58:17.760 --> 58:18.920
Because we meet in person.

58:18.920 --> 58:21.800
And I guess I just, I can't put enough emphasis

58:21.800 --> 58:24.280
on this one really kind of cliche point.

58:24.280 --> 58:27.680
And that is meeting people in person

58:27.680 --> 58:31.080
is completely, totally different than meeting them online.

58:31.080 --> 58:34.880
Online, we have these two-dimensional personas

58:34.880 --> 58:35.960
that we put out there.

58:35.960 --> 58:39.000
And then we interact with these two-dimensional personas.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.200
When I first started getting on the internet

58:42.200 --> 58:44.940
and you had to dial up and connect to it,

58:44.940 --> 58:48.800
you connected with a handle, a name,

58:48.800 --> 58:51.680
a screen name or a nickname.

58:51.680 --> 58:54.280
And so nothing had my name attached to it

58:54.280 --> 58:55.760
and nothing had your name attached to it.

58:55.760 --> 58:58.300
And so things just weren't quite as serious

58:58.300 --> 59:01.200
because it wasn't coming from a real person

59:01.200 --> 59:03.480
with their name and identity attached to it.

59:03.480 --> 59:05.760
It was from some anonymous douchebag on the internet.

59:05.760 --> 59:08.360
And so it didn't quite matter as much.

59:08.360 --> 59:10.400
But now with social networking

59:10.400 --> 59:12.640
and all these other platforms,

59:12.640 --> 59:14.440
we're all using our real names.

59:14.440 --> 59:16.200
We all have our real faces on there.

59:16.200 --> 59:19.760
And so now it's Chris Fisher and Donald Trump.

59:19.760 --> 59:20.900
It's like these real people

59:20.900 --> 59:22.360
that are making these statements on these.

59:22.360 --> 59:25.280
And so we take these statements so much more seriously.

59:25.280 --> 59:28.320
But there's still these two-dimensional, low context,

59:28.320 --> 59:33.320
low information statements that we interpret so much

59:33.560 --> 59:35.020
and trigger our own emotional baggage.

59:35.020 --> 59:37.880
And it creates this total hostile dialogue online.

59:37.880 --> 59:41.280
And then you add in the total dumpster fuel fire

59:41.280 --> 59:46.160
that is clickbait journalism and ad-based clicks

59:46.160 --> 59:47.000
that just really make

59:47.000 --> 59:50.040
for a horrible, horrible hostile discussion online.

59:50.040 --> 59:52.600
And you just bypass all of that

59:52.600 --> 59:54.600
when you meet up with people in person.

59:56.280 --> 59:58.000
All that baggage is gone.

59:58.000 --> 59:58.840
And it's just-

59:58.840 --> 59:59.660
Wait, are you saying

59:59.660 --> 01:00:02.280
you don't take seriously Captain Snorlax?

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:05.160
That's one person you always take seriously.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.300
Okay, cool.

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.400
Says the guy with the handle called Rotten.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:11.120
Or my nickname?

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.320
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.580
Although one person I always take quite seriously is Popey.

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:16.420
Hello, Popey.

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:17.240
Hello.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.080
It's good to see you.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:18.900
How are you?

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:19.740
Good, good.

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:20.560
We've missed you.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.400
We've missed you.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.520
I missed you at scale, but I'm glad you're here.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.760
Yeah, sorry I couldn't make that.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.800
I may be hanging out with your better half soon though.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:28.640
So that'll be good.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.460
That'll be fun.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.560
Yeah, I'm tracking his flight.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.400
He's nearly landed.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.320
He's gonna be there soon.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.320
So that's not confidential.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.640
We can say that he's-

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.480
Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.080
Yeah, Wimpy's landing in Seattle

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.120
probably in the next few minutes, actually.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:41.960
That's so exciting.

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:42.780
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:44.840
I don't think, he's gonna be too busy to come on the show,

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:45.960
but I'm gonna try to run down there

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.440
and buy him a beer at least, or 10,

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:51.680
because how often does Popey or Wimpy

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.760
actually make it to our area?

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:55.600
Well, it turns out more often than you'd expect.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.280
Twice in the last month, weirdly.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.120
Wow.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:03.680
But, and that's probably just a limited time thing,

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.800
so I gotta take advantage of it while we can.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.200
Yeah, well, Popey, you have anything to share

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.360
at the class before we get out of here today?

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.200
I was just about to wrap this thing up.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.700
Michael Sunnell Rotten is a lovely person.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:15.880
That's all I've got to share.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:16.960
Okay, I agree.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.000
Yeah. I agree.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.600
Oh, hey, actually, Ubuntu Podcast is back.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.360
Could share that, do a little plug skis.

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.480
Ubuntu Podcast returned and just had Will Cook on the show.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.320
Yes, we did.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.280
That's something.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:32.280
We discussed the things that are happening for 1804,

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.360
some of the decisions that were made,

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.760
and some of the controversial things

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.600
that people have been talking about on the internet.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.800
We would discuss that in episode two,

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.640
and turns out, episode three and four,

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.240
we just had Michael Sunnell on.

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.080
Oh.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:44.920
Whoa.

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.040
See, it's a circle of plugs there.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.760
A circle of podcasts.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.600
Yeah, right?

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:51.420
Yeah.

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.320
Well, good, that's awesome.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.520
I look forward to hearing that.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.520
And the nice thing is, you know,

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.880
there's a pretty good chance then

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.000
when producer Michael goes on,

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:58.920
he's gonna have good audio.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.080
So that's nice too.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:00.920
I always appreciate that.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.240
I typically do, yes.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.080
Yeah, you do.

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.320
You do.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.520
I don't have a soundboard with a ding in it,

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.360
but I would, if I did, I would.

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.200
There we go.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.040
You just gotta get a bell.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:10.860
There it is.

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:11.700
I'll just get you a bell.

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:12.540
I should just get you a bell.

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:13.360
Nothing beats the hard copy.

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.200
Yeah.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.960
I do like having the physical bell right here,

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:16.960
and so do the kids.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.840
It's a hit with the kids when they come into the studio.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.020
They always gotta play with dad's bell.

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:21.860
Wait a minute.

01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:23.760
All right, well, let's get out of here while we still can,

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.600
because I just think that just went in a bad direction.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.080
You guys, thank you very much for being here.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.680
We'd love to have you join us in the Mamba Room.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.920
Go over to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.140
for when we do this here show live,

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:36.800
because it's true, it's a live production.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.640
It's one of the few, so why not get in while it's still live?

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:39.480
Yeah, savor it.

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.960
Yeah.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:43.000
And you can get more Mumble information

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.240
if you go on irc.geekshed.net.

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.720
Do bang Mumble, and it'll give you the server information

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:50.720
so you can hang out in our virtual lug.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.880
You can submit content ideas to linuxunplug.reddit.com,

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:58.640
and of course, go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact,

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:02.320
and keep an eye out for those feed changes.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.920
Maybe new things coming.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.280
Lots happening.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.160
And just a few more episodes of Tech Talk Today

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.920
for season one, techtalk.today,

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.220
and go get more Wes and Chris, techsnap.systems.

01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:15.200
See you next week.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.040
Bye.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:45.960
And we'll see you next week.

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:50.080
Wimpy is currently traveling 536 miles per hour

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.560
with a Wi-Fi connection.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.200
Isn't that amazing?

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.600
He's had a decent-ish connection this whole flight,

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.440
because I've seen him in Telegram the whole time.

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:02.160
So I know he's got at least some Wi-Fi.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.600
What a time to live.

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.800
Yeah, it really is.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.640
This is pretty great.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:06.440
Look at this.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.760
And I wonder how expensive that Wi-Fi is, too.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:13.600
Look at this, you can retrace the whole flight.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.480
Oh, that is neat.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:15.160
This is great.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.080
That is really cool.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.080
There's a little bit where they estimated where the flight was,

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.280
where apparently Wimpy went offline for a bit.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:24.200
And then he reconnects as he comes in over Canada.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:25.400
Hey, how's my audio now?

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:25.840
Much better.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.640
So what were you trying to tell us earlier?

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.640
Well, I was trying to tell you what I ended up doing,

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:33.400
because I have bookshelves full of CDs.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.200
When I downsized to the trailer, I

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.280
had to put all of that in storage.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:41.600
So I put it all in a tub, basically a tote.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:45.760
But before I did, I ripped everything onto a one terabyte

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:49.080
hard drive, which is being straight from Plex.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.520
Yeah, I was thinking about Plex.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:54.480
So that's the direction I went, but I hardly ever use it

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.360
because I use Spotify all the time.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:56.840
Sure.

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:59.440
Oh, that old story.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:02.720
Oh, no, if there's a reason to repair all of your CDs

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.120
and stuff, it's legitimately to try

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:08.920
to get software to do gender recognition

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:12.520
and actually try to make some choices for you.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:16.920
There's actually a piece of open source software,

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:20.800
which I've been using for you, and trying

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.000
to make it so that it can become a recommendation

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.320
system for new music.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.240
So I'll let the bot go to YouTube.

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.880
Yeah, you know, I won't lie.

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.800
You've honed in on one of the things

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.680
that I do kind of use these services for

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.680
is to find me new music, because I don't really

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.400
put a very high priority on music.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.960
I also am not actively discovering new music

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.400
like I used to.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.400
And so the fact that these things have some kind

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.200
of algorithm to try to surface music is nice.

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.840
JBtitles.com.

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.520
Last FM does that pretty well.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.360
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.520
So does Pandora.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:57.920
If you start to put your music list on Last FM,

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.840
you normally get good recommendations.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.680
You just have to squabble your music.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:03.800
I wish it was back in a few.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.080
Import a list or something.

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.520
That would be great, because I don't

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.320
like listening to the streaming services.

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.160
I'd rather have it on.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.760
I'd rather have local media.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:14.160
And then give me some suggestions off of this list

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.000
of artists.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.080
Wouldn't it be great?

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.200
And here's the thing.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:21.000
If you really enjoy listening to music

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.920
and really hate when you get interrupted,

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:25.280
at least keep some of them locally,

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:28.960
because there's always going to be that one moment where

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:32.400
you're going to be absolutely bored of not having local stuff.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.840
If you'd like to have 30 minutes of no ads,

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.080
just watch this video.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.600
Seriously.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:41.520
It's a 30-second ad to get you to watch another ad.

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:43.520
The other thing about the streaming services

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:48.000
that's sort of like a sucky, secondary, first-world problem

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.680
is it's kind of like a shit show,

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:53.080
like how they all integrate with different devices

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:57.480
and like TV set-top boxes, lady tubes,

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.960
all these different things.

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.480
Some of them work with Spotify if you

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.160
use this particular incantation.

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.640
Some of them work with Google Music.

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:05.880
Some of them work with Pandora.

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.320
Some of them work with Amazon streaming music

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.520
if you use a different incantation.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.360
It's really kind of all over the place.

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:12.840
It really is.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:13.520
Yeah, right.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:16.280
By the way, Chris, I'm not sure if you'll want this.

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:19.000
I can link it to the project I was talking

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.480
about, the general recognition project.

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.320
Sure, yeah.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.320
Yeah, if that's a thing, I'd like to see it.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.360
Put it in there if you don't mind, toss it in the IRC

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:27.120
so that other guys can see it, too.

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:30.600
By the way, related topic in regards to Linux,

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.840
well, Linux on mobile being Android at the moment,

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.360
what do you think Android P is going to be?

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:39.640
Well, it sounds like it's so far a UI overhaul, a lot

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.680
of small UI overhauls.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:41.640
No, I mean the name.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.000
Did you guys notice that all the UI elements

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.480
are basically Fuchsia OS?

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:46.160
Yes.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.000
Yeah.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:47.960
Yeah.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:51.080
I thought that I had that same thought.

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:51.960
Oh, name?

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:53.960
Stratum.

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:55.040
What's something that P?

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.660
I bet it's going to be not a sweetie.

01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:58.120
I think it's going to be like a healthy thing.

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.480
I think they're going to be the laziest thing ever.

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:00.960
Pancreas.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:06.720
Because all of their stuff has been desserts or pastries.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.160
It's just going to be pastry.

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:11.680
Oh, they're just going to call it Android pastry?

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.400
No, no, that's too generic.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:16.080
That wouldn't be Google.

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:19.000
I think they're going to drop the sweets parfait.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.280
Parfait is also really good.

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:21.200
I like parfait.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.160
That's good.

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.240
That's good.

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:28.480
I'm going to say pudding because I hope it's Android pudding.

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.640
I hope it's Android pudding.
