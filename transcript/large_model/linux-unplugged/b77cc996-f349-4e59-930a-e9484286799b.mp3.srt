00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 20 for December 24th, 2013.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,380
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's making

3
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,520
our list and checking it twice.

4
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,700
My name is Chris.

5
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,700
My name is Matt.

6
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,700
Hey Matt.

7
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,360
Episode 20, buddy, and it's a happy holiday around here.

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,680
I've got the Christmas tree up, but I'm going to be honest.

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,660
That top star, I tried to put it on the top of the tree.

10
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,840
I was foiled, Matt.

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,760
The hole is too small.

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,680
And you know, I've had that problem with more things than just the tree, but I've also yet

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,440
to put decorations up, so I won't talk.

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,120
It's been a reoccurring, boy, you better get on it, Matt.

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
It is.

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
I know.

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
Well, we got the tree up, but we have no decorations.

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,400
We've got to look at it like, eh, do I really care?

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
It's a staged approach.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
No.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
You've got to think about this.

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,900
So first, it's a lot like software deployment.

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,640
You deploy your base package, make sure everything's stable.

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,060
You got to run that for a little bit.

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,320
Make sure your change control committee has signed off on the deployment.

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,840
And then once the tree is up, you deploy the lights.

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,120
And then once the committee signed off on that, you deploy the decorations.

28
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
Yeah.

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
Now I understand.

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,120
That's good.

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,480
See, here, we just do a shotgun at the Fisher residence.

32
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,080
We just throw things on there.

33
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,080
I like that idea.

34
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
I like that idea.

35
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,360
Personally, I say lights and tinsel, you're done, right?

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
Right.

37
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
It's all you really need.

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
Yeah.

39
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,680
I'm one of those people who would actually like to keep the tree up all year round, because

40
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,320
I just like the ambient light it gives off.

41
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,960
But we have also now, because we're parents, we have used the tree as a motivator to make

42
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,680
our children behave when we have a babysitter.

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,880
So I went out and did some Christmas shopping, and my wife was going out and doing some scrap

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
booking.

45
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,120
And we're parents, we're leaving the house, it never happens, probably only time it's

46
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,400
ever happened this year alone.

47
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,200
And so we thought, well, we'll reserve some of the decorations, and that way the babysitter

48
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,960
can leverage the decorations to solicit the cooperation of the children.

49
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:19,480
And I'm not saying you should leverage the holiday spirit when possible, but personal

50
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,120
experience does show it does seem to work.

51
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
Mm-hmm.

52
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
All right, Matt.

53
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,240
Well, our first one is something we've been getting a lot of emails about.

54
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,440
And to be honest with you, I haven't seen a big controversy with it, so I haven't covered

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,800
it on any of our shows yet, but we've gotten a lot of emails, and Mark just had a really

56
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,840
good concise email about it.

57
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,280
He writes in, he says, I just saw an article about Canonical asking the Linux Mint project

58
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,960
and maybe other Ubuntu-based distros to license the Ubuntu binary files in their software

59
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
repo.

60
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,220
Whatever happened to open source and the GPL?

61
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,220
So here's the...

62
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,240
And I'll cut through what everybody in the Linux, I'm going to say 99% of the Linux community

63
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,280
misunderstands about how the GPL license works.

64
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,240
Free is in freedom, not free is in beer.

65
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,840
And so when something is done a certain way and if it's allowable, if you're not actually

66
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,080
working with the code, you're working with those particular packages, and however they

67
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,480
determine to the act of compiling them or whatever it is, whatever they've got going

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,640
on, honestly, at the end of the day, I'm not really a fan of the idea.

69
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,200
I think it's a huge mistake, but can they do it?

70
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
Can they do it?

71
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
Yeah, they can.

72
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Well, sure, they sure they can.

73
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Yeah, absolutely they can.

74
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
They can totally do.

75
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
That's what people don't...

76
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Do you remember when the Firefox...

77
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,880
Do you remember that when Firefox and Debian had their hold falling out and they renamed

78
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
it to Iceweasel?

79
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
Oh, yes, over the trademark logos, yeah.

80
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
And everybody got all sensitive about it.

81
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
Yeah.

82
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,360
So the Distro Watch ran this report based on a comment that Clem made on his blog post.

83
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,560
Now I want to give you guys a sense of actually how old this is.

84
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,360
So Clem made this post, remember back a few weeks ago when a couple of Ubuntu developers

85
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,480
and actually one that's not even...I don't think he's in the Ubuntu project anymore,

86
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,040
Ben, made some comments as sometimes Mint is behind the ball on security updates.

87
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,720
At that time, Clem did a very good, very rational follow-up post that said, here's what's really

88
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
going on.

89
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,720
And in that, towards the end of that post, he made reference that, oh, by the way, I've

90
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,240
been speaking with Canonical Legal about licensing their binary files.

91
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,960
In fact, this is the Slashdart post on it.

92
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
It's pretty brief.

93
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,480
It says, Clem claims he has been asked by Canonical's legal department to license the

94
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,480
binary packages used by Ubuntu.

95
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,600
He says, to me, this is a scary thought.

96
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,840
Ubuntu-based distributions for many projects out there, some of them such as Mint and Kubuntu,

97
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,080
are quite successful.

98
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,360
Clem's statement makes it clear that Canonical's approach other open source projects about

99
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,220
licensing the right across Ubuntu's repos.

100
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,640
They go on to ask, would derivative distributions need to pay to use Canonical's packages?

101
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,640
How would Canonical enforce such a policy with lawyers by blocking access to repositories

102
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,720
if they isn't using genuine Ubuntu?

103
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,440
Now I thought it would be negligent here on our part to pick our resident Ubuntu expert.

104
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,440
Now he, Popey, will be speaking on behalf of himself, not the Canonical company.

105
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,980
But I wonder, Popey, do you kind of agree with me?

106
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,160
Is this kind of a non-story?

107
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,040
I mean, we've seen this before with upstream vendors, right?

108
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,120
And Firefox comes to mind.

109
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:16,360
Firefox has contacted distributions in the past and said, hey, could you not use our

110
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,920
branding and our slogan?

111
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,440
If you're going to follow these rules, you either need a license from us or you need

112
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
to come up with something else.

113
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,280
Is, Popey, in your opinion, is this what we're seeing here?

114
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
It's tricky, yeah.

115
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
I'm not speaking for Canonical.

116
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,000
This is my personal opinion.

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,520
And I can see why there's some uproar.

118
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,880
I can see why there's backlash because we give everything away for free, right?

119
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,600
You get the Ubuntu software for nothing and then, hang on, this guy is trying to make

120
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:51,080
a derivative of Ubuntu and it's seen by many as competition for us.

121
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,360
And maybe some people see us as, you know, butthurt that some guy is getting a lot of

122
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,760
attention and maybe we're trying to get some money out of him, you know, to compensate

123
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,760
us for that.

124
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,880
But my perspective, I don't think that's the case.

125
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,920
I think what you've got to remember is that there's the Ubuntu project itself, there's

126
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,280
the derivatives, which, you know, your listener mentioned Kubuntu, but he mentioned Kubuntu

127
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,160
and Mint in the same breath and they're not really the same.

128
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:24,560
Kubuntu, Edubuntu, Mythbuntu and all the other flavors have been brought into the Ubuntu

129
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,680
project and they have some level of responsibility for the packages that they deliver.

130
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,440
So the Kubuntu project actually work on their KDE packages and we have a level of responsibility

131
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,800
to ensure that the rest of the archive works with what they make.

132
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
It's kind of under the same umbrella.

133
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
And the same goes for all the others.

134
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Okay.

135
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Yeah.

136
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
And so we work together.

137
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,520
We work collaboratively on the same set of packages.

138
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,120
So we don't, you know, ask the Kubuntu developers to have some kind of, you know, payment licensing

139
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,560
thing because they're working on the same set of packages that we are.

140
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,880
Whereas derivatives, some derivatives will take our source packages and rebuild them.

141
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,280
I can't for the life of me think of anyone who does that, but that's possible in the

142
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,200
way that SteamOS have rebuilt the Debian packages, so Valve have rebuilt the Debian packages

143
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
for SteamOS.

144
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,920
They built their own binaries based on the Debian source packages.

145
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,520
So that's seen as okay.

146
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,120
Whereas Linux Mint are not doing that.

147
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,340
What Linux Mint are doing is delivering an ISO image, which points to our archive and

148
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:32,800
our mirrors, which are maintained by people that we pay and our community work on our

149
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,600
project and they're getting the benefit from that.

150
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,720
So I can see how, I can see both sides of it, but I can, I can certainly see why Canonica

151
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
will be not.

152
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
So have you heard of any, is there a financial terms here?

153
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Have you heard of anything like that?

154
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Is there a, is there a...

155
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
I have no idea.

156
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Okay.

157
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,440
Because I can, in a way, I suppose you can make the same argument with somebody like

158
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,680
Integros, right?

159
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,720
Where they're building a product, but they're using the hosting of Ubuntu.

160
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,800
So Mint is building their desktop, but if you turned off one night, if boom, all of

161
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,400
the Ubuntu repos were turned off, Mint would become unfunctional.

162
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
It would be dysfunctional.

163
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Right.

164
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,520
And I don't, I don't actually think Mint accounts for a huge proportion of the traffic to our

165
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,680
mirrors.

166
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:21,480
I know people might think that Mint actually, given its ranking on DistroWatch, think that

167
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,960
it's got twice the number of users Ubuntu has, that's flat out isn't the case.

168
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
No, I know.

169
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,960
Anyone following DistroWatch needs to know.

170
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
Yeah.

171
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,840
So, so I'm not sure it makes a significant dent in the archive, in the, in the, in the

172
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,640
mirrors, the traffic, but it's, it's just, to me, it's irresponsible for them to put

173
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:48,360
out an ISO image, which depends on what is, in effect, their competitor's product.

174
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,160
You know, you wouldn't, you wouldn't have...

175
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,400
But can't you make that same exact argument?

176
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,880
I mean, you can't make the repo argument, but you can make the derivative argument between

177
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,760
Ubuntu and Debian itself.

178
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
We rebuild every package.

179
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,760
Right.

180
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
No, I understand.

181
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
You host it.

182
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,400
We have, we have developers who are paid to do the patching and, and maintain those packages

183
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
in Ubuntu.

184
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Yeah, sure.

185
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,960
There are some that are just straight out rebuilds.

186
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Yeah.

187
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:19,320
We've imported them from Debian and we rebuild them on our vast array of servers and we host

188
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,560
them on our servers and then our mirrors, you know, mirror them.

189
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,880
So I don't think it's, it's very, it's, it's the same.

190
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
No, you're right.

191
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,920
Cause it's more akin to more like Red Hat and CentOS is a relationship in a sense.

192
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
Yeah.

193
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
And SteamOS and Debian.

194
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Yeah.

195
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
Where they're, where, exactly.

196
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,760
SteamOS is also taking on the burden of the infrastructure and re and the rebuilding of

197
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,040
many of the packages, just like CentOS rebuilds all the packages, takes on the burden of hosting

198
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,000
those packages and those repos.

199
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,160
So imagine, imagine for example, if Linux Mint said, you know, whatever desktop they're

200
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,800
using Marte, Cinnamon, whatever it is, and they said, okay, here are all the packages

201
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,720
that for where we are different from Ubuntu, let's try and get those in the archive, in

202
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
the Ubuntu archive.

203
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Yeah.

204
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,640
And then once they're in the Ubuntu archive, Linux Mint is for want of a better word, a

205
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
flavor of Ubuntu.

206
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,960
It can still be called Linux Mint.

207
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,160
I'm sure, you know, you can, you can still have your default desktop that isn't Unity

208
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,960
if you don't like that isn't known three, if you don't like that, you can still have

209
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,680
whatever, you know, bits and bobs you want, but they're in the archive, they're well maintained.

210
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,680
You know, they get security updates, timely fashion that I know Ollie and Ben alluded

211
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,200
to in that in that blog post, but there isn't this our competitor building on the stuff

212
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,000
that we've we've already built for them, if that makes sense.

213
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,200
And the other thing I personally think is a bit is a bit rude, is taking the Ubuntu

214
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,480
archive, and not only reusing it, but then going

215
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Go ahead.

216
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
What happened?

217
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
Did we lose him?

218
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,480
I guess.

219
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,400
I think he's about to make his best point yet.

220
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,960
We'll come back to that point.

221
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,120
I think that, you know, from my perspective, and I think he brought up some really good

222
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
points.

223
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,080
I have concerns over the, you know, the political capital that actually is played into it and

224
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,440
that, you know, regardless of what company it may be, any public facing company that's

225
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,640
put into that really tough position has to make a, you know, it's about to make that

226
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
play.

227
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,760
Are they in a position to actually back that up?

228
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,440
Are they in a position to potentially deal with, even if it's unfair fallout, to deal

229
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,280
with what's going to be fallout over that?

230
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,160
We've seen this with other stuff, other challenges that they've faced.

231
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,560
So I have some concerns there.

232
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,040
And it is interesting to look in there in the

233
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
Oh, there we go.

234
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
We got him back.

235
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
I think you're back.

236
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
I think you're back.

237
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Hi there.

238
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
We were here the whole time.

239
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
I know.

240
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
I don't know what happened.

241
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,080
Well, I don't know if you guys have seen Thor, but the five realms are aligning and sometimes

242
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,160
there are phases between the realities.

243
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
I think I'm Thor.

244
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Isn't it?

245
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,080
So did I drop out partway through what I was saying?

246
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:52,800
You were just about to, you were wrapping up your thought on the sort of the use of

247
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
the repos, I think.

248
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Yes.

249
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Yeah.

250
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,080
The last thing that I think is just a little bit rude is if you're going to use someone

251
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,760
else's archive, don't go through replacing all the affiliate links, which I know Mint

252
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
do.

253
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Oh, interesting.

254
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Yeah.

255
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,760
Yeah.

256
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
No, that definitely wins the douche award.

257
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,760
Absolutely.

258
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,560
You know, I don't mean to harsh on Mint, but there is, there is some sort of, um, there

259
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,760
is a like, boy, it's almost like the mob a little bit.

260
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,100
Like you got the Ubuntu boss and then you got the guy working under the Ubuntu boss

261
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,580
who maybe should be kicking up a little bit to the boss, right?

262
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,440
Because he's the boss, letting him work in his district.

263
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,360
I've lost track of who's the boss now.

264
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Well, yeah.

265
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,280
That was a very popular show at one time.

266
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,720
I don't necessarily think I'm ready to take sides on this argument, but I think, I think

267
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,180
the canonical argument is one to be considered because, uh, yeah, there you're, you're basing

268
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,120
a lot of Mint success on Ubuntu.

269
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:44,160
In fact, I, I was having a discussion in our chat room early this morning, um, that, uh,

270
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,720
somebody was in the chat room who was having some troubles with Linux Mint Debian edition.

271
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,920
And I, I love the Linux Mint Debian edition exists.

272
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,080
And I think that's, I think that's a really good thing, but, uh, what I don't see the,

273
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,800
I don't see the purpose of it compared to straight up Linux Mint because straight up

274
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,240
Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu.

275
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,640
And the primary advantage I see there is Ubuntu compatibility, i.e. if you want to install

276
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,080
something for Ubuntu, it installs perfectly on Linux Mint.

277
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,760
Well, that's not entirely true either.

278
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,720
I mean, they claim binary compatibility with Ubuntu, but that's not entirely true.

279
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
No.

280
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
It's no.

281
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,800
And, and we get, we get, um, yeah, I know we get people asking us for support on Mint

282
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,160
and sometimes there's things that don't work on Mint that work on Ubuntu.

283
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
Really?

284
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
Yeah.

285
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
I've experienced it.

286
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,000
It's not terribly common, but when you hit it, you hit it like a brick wall.

287
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Well, I suppose so.

288
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah.

289
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah.

290
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,640
Also, y'all forget, um, the whole, uh, browser search engine thing.

291
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:45,800
They get, uh, Yahoo pays them to not use Google in the, uh, the web browser for Firefox.

292
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
They replace the searches.

293
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,120
So what would be really nice is if we worked together and had a set of, a set of packages,

294
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,640
which, you know, were robust, well-tested, secure for our users and Mint users.

295
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:05,400
I think, Poppy, what you're saying there is a great idea if things were started today,

296
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,820
but you have to, you know, when I look back, I look at, I, I look at Clem as a crazy son

297
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,440
of a bitch who has taken on way more than he can.

298
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,080
And I, and by my estimation, should have burned out like two or three years ago, right?

299
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,440
But the man just keeps moving on.

300
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,640
And really, I believe at the end of the day, it is because he focuses on creating a desktop

301
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,920
that he believes should truly represent what the Linux desktop is capable of.

302
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,520
And what he's primarily focuses on is creating that thing.

303
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,560
And like for me, for example, there are many things in my life and my professional career

304
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,640
and my personal career that fall to the side because I am so focused on making that next

305
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
show.

306
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
And that's all I think about.

307
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,100
And I think he's the same way about Linux Mint.

308
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,680
He is so zeroed in on that, the idea of collaborating and working with a company where you got to

309
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,600
go through three or four levels of management, maybe through the PR person, it is definitely

310
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,080
an absolute appropriate proposition.

311
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,000
But if you told me that, I'd basically tell you to go fuck yourself.

312
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,360
I got better stuff to do, right?

313
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,720
I have, I got to focus on my work.

314
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,500
I don't have time to play politics or politics.

315
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,640
And I think that's where he's coming from appropriate or not.

316
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,920
And I would maybe suggest that Mint has reached the size where that is no longer appropriate.

317
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,520
Yeah, I think he does feel, you know, from the way I've read his blog post, that a lot

318
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,400
of this kind of politicking is a massive waste of his time, right?

319
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Resources.

320
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Right.

321
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
And he has a lot better things to do.

322
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,360
And I can see that, you know, given as a small developer team, you know, don't get me wrong,

323
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,120
I have no problem with Mint existing.

324
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,080
I have no problem with them using personally using the Ubuntu archive.

325
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,120
I just want it all to be above board and for people to stop slinging mud at each other.

326
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,400
And it also seems like I can see the perspective, too.

327
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,280
It's like, well, look, if you, you know, if your success is going to be kind of based

328
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,160
on our labors, if you're going to stand on our shoulders, maybe we can work together

329
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,020
as much as possible to make it an equitable position for everybody.

330
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,000
And I think that's actually completely reasonable, too.

331
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,520
So anyway, so that's our thoughts.

332
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,800
If you guys have been wondering where our stance is on this whole thing, I know we've

333
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
had a few threads in the Linux Action Show subreddit.

334
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,600
We've also had plenty of emails about it.

335
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,440
So Mark, thanks for emailing in and kicking that topic off.

336
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,400
I think that was a good discussion to be had.

337
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,200
And I'd love to hear your guys' thoughts on it, too.

338
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,040
So go over to jupyterbroadcasting.com and pop that contact link, choose Linux Unplugged

339
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,840
from the drop down and send us in your thoughts and we'll read them up as follow up in next

340
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
week's episode.

341
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,960
But before we go on, I want to thank our first sponsor this week and that, my friends, is

342
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
DigitalOcean.

343
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,760
DigitalOcean has opened my eyes that cloud hosting can be one part awesome, two parts

344
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,920
simple, straightforward and also under your control.

345
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,600
And that last little bit there, that where I had a comma and I said, oh, by the way,

346
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,680
it's also under your control, let's put an underline and italicize that because I think

347
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,680
that's the biggest point.

348
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,800
You get root access to the devices you create.

349
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,720
DigitalOcean is simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

350
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,400
to spin up a cloud server.

351
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,520
Users can create a server in 55 seconds.

352
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,160
You know, I did it in 45 seconds.

353
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,160
You can do it.

354
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
Time it.

355
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
Time it and let me know.

356
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,480
55 seconds though, that's the average.

357
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,480
And their pricing plans start at $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM.

358
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,720
And I want to remind you, Linux has amazing memory management, 512 megs of RAM on a server

359
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,880
that doesn't run a GUI can get you so far.

360
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,680
A 20 gigabyte SSD, again, everything I just said applies to SSD and yes, it's a 20 gigabyte

361
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,240
SSD when you pair that with the DigitalOcean internet speeds.

362
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Woo!

363
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
Love that.

364
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,680
When I'm updating Arch, yes, I have an Arch server, everybody get off my sack, I have

365
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
an Arch server.

366
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,060
When I'm updating Arch, watching those packages fly down and update, it's as fast as that

367
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,840
SSH session can send me the updates.

368
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
It is a beautiful thing.

369
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,280
Plus, you also get a terabyte of transfer.

370
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,280
I like that.

371
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,680
I mean, it's just so stupid, stupidly reasonably as far as price is predictable.

372
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,320
It's so simple to follow too.

373
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Not only is it $5.

374
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,320
Can you click a button?

375
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,320
I mean.

376
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Yeah, right.

377
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
Yeah, the droplet deployment is super easy.

378
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,320
It's $5 to start with the base server.

379
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,320
That's what I've got.

380
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,360
If you use the promo code Linux Unplugged December, you'll get a $10 credit, which will

381
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,560
get you two months.

382
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,360
And check this out.

383
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,320
The next box up, $10 a month.

384
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,020
The box up after that, $20 a month.

385
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,480
The next one, $40.

386
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
You get it, right?

387
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,480
It's very simple.

388
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,480
Very straightforward.

389
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,400
DigitalOcean also offers hourly pricing.

390
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,160
Now, why would you want hourly pricing?

391
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,400
Well, think about this.

392
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,000
Maybe you've got a project that you want to have a few folks bang on.

393
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,700
Maybe you've got a client you want to spin something up that they can test on because

394
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,400
one of the things DigitalOcean offers you is the ability to clone your droplet.

395
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,440
So if you have a really nice setup with maybe Ubuntu 12.04 and LAMP stack, or maybe you

396
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,560
got Arch in the LAMP stack and you have a project on there you want to deliver to a

397
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,820
client, you can spin up an hourly server.

398
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,080
The client bangs on it for a few hours, gives you their feedback, and then you turn it back

399
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,080
down.

400
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,640
That's where the hourly pricing comes in.

401
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,920
But if you're like me and you want to have some infrastructure support, I have a distribution

402
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,080
system over BitTorrent Sync for the unfiltered supporters, and I use DigitalOcean to supplement

403
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,280
that to make it better.

404
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,600
So that way my customers, aka our supporters, have an amazing experience that saturates

405
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,360
their download capacity, and DigitalOcean provides that.

406
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,080
So go over to DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code LINUXUNPLUGDECEMBER.

407
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,640
You'll get a $10 credit, which if you use the $5 box like I'm using, that's going to

408
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,640
be two months.

409
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,960
By the way, DigitalOcean also offers a vast collection of tutorials in their community

410
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,600
section on their site.

411
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,480
Furthermore, users can submit an article to the community and get paid $50 per published

412
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
piece.

413
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,720
We'll have a link to that in the show notes right underneath the banner.

414
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,320
So go over to DigitalOcean and use the promo code LINUXUNPLUGDECEMBER.

415
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,280
It is almost the end of December, so you better use it while you can.

416
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,280
That's all I'm saying.

417
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,440
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

418
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
Love those guys.

419
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Woohoo!

420
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
Good stuff.

421
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,760
Another thing that Matt wrote in, I don't even think I'm screwing that up, I actually

422
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,680
think that's straight up how you say it.

423
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,160
And he has a follow up on our Tiling Window Manager challenge that we're going to be taking

424
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
in early 2014.

425
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:42,120
He says, a fan of the show, and I heard about the potential tiling challenge and figured

426
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,880
I'd shoot you guys a message.

427
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:50,280
Which is good, Matt, because I feel like you and I, we have vacationed in Tiling Window

428
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,120
Managers, but we have never stayed there.

429
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,120
Right?

430
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,120
Is that true for you?

431
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,120
This is true.

432
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,600
This is the high pressure sales pitch.

433
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Right.

434
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
And that would be coming from the chat room.

435
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,560
I spent like a week, I think, once in Awesome for the Linux Action Show, it was like forever

436
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
ago.

437
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,600
He says, I posted in the subreddit, but I thought maybe I'd send this in just to make

438
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,080
sure you guys saw it.

439
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,600
He wants to, this Matt, also by the way, I think this might be the way to go.

440
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,580
He says, if you're interested in different Window Managers, I would suggest you check

441
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,280
out Linux BBQ.

442
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,920
It has a distro called Gangbang.

443
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,920
Alright?

444
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Okay, so.

445
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
Okay, you got my attention.

446
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
I'm interested.

447
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,760
In the Window Manager.

448
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,760
I mean, I'm just saying, Matt.

449
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
I'm just.

450
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Choo choo.

451
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,720
So, maybe this would be the way you'd like dip your toe and figure out what you're comfortable

452
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,720
with.

453
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,720
You know, you could swing from desktop to desktop just to see what you like.

454
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,880
He says it has dozens of Window Managers to check out in a live distro.

455
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,480
He says a crazy group that has developed through CrunchBrain, if I'm not mistaken.

456
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,480
In fact, there's a link in CrunchBag's forums where someone tested out 30 Window Managers

457
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
in 30 days.

458
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,300
I got to be honest, I've been wanting to try that 30 things out in 30, anyways, a lot

459
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,960
of that info is experiment in Linux BBQ's wiki.

460
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,440
We've mentioned Linux BBQ in the past.

461
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,160
He said, I also want to say I completely agree that what was posted before, I think mentioned

462
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,880
last week's show, which would be better to make your own complete desktop environment.

463
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,600
You're kind of rolling your own distro in a sense.

464
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,640
He says, this is how I do it.

465
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,620
For example, I have Debian testing net install, which brings me to a console.

466
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,920
Then I upgrade to SID, I install SystemD, and I just start configuring.

467
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,280
I use I3 Window Manager or FB term with Tmux, depending on my mood.

468
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,280
I set my background VFF and or Nitrogen.

469
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,240
Lately, I've used XFE or Midnight Commander as a file manager.

470
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,280
I bring in the tools that I think are best, borrowing from other Window Managers and desktop

471
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,440
environments as I see fit.

472
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,620
And I piece it together into my ultimate desktop environment.

473
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,720
But I'm a little crazy with things like Linux BBQ group.

474
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,880
I use terminal programs like RSI and UmC Pop and Piano Bar, etc. when I can.

475
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,080
And I've been known to throw some heavy gooey apps on the screen when I need or want to.

476
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,440
So I want to say, give it a little time, have some fun with it, get inspired, and follow

477
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,920
other people and their configs, like unixporn.reddit.com, which is, by the way, unixporn.reddit.com is

478
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,560
a great place to be inspired by your desktop config.

479
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,840
And I love to hear how you guys fared after some much-deserved vacation time.

480
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,720
I wish both of you and your families a Merry Christmas, phyllo, polio, math.

481
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,800
Well, you know, I never thought at 40 years old I'd be saying, hey, Chris, let's go check

482
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
out this gangbang.

483
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,600
But apparently that's what we're going to be doing.

484
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,560
I like that it's got barbecue in the name too, Matt.

485
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,840
It's like totally right up my alley.

486
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
Well, and it's got barbecue.

487
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,440
And if it has the barbecue sauce, then we've made the connection.

488
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:36,240
So one of the things, this is just a big go figure.

489
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,920
I haven't been using my Bonobo for the last couple episodes of the Linux Action Show,

490
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,640
but I have on my Bonobo.

491
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:49,020
I think zeroed in on the most amazing KDE configuration that has ever been conceived

492
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,120
on the planet Earth.

493
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,200
I mean, I look at it, I'm looking at it right now because you're Skyping in on it.

494
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,400
I mean, Matt, I'm telling you, I look at the screen and it is like a freaking piece of

495
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
art.

496
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,240
So now I got this pressure from the Linux Action Show audience to try out these tiling

497
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,240
window managers.

498
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
I mean, here I am.

499
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,560
I got KDE just the way I like it.

500
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,560
Yeah.

501
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,360
I mean, it's apples and oranges as far as what you're gaining from each.

502
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,240
I mean, the tiling windows manager, I guess is, I still don't really understand the appeal.

503
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,000
I guess it's for, if you have limited screen real estate, you want a lot of stuff up at

504
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
once.

505
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
No, I think I got it.

506
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I think I got it.

507
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So what I discovered when I did the Arch challenge and which ended up appealing to me is I kind

508
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,680
of was, I was taking all of my experience from every other distro that I've used and

509
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,320
bringing it together in one configuration that I really liked.

510
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,240
And what I mean by that is because you pick at each layer in Arch what you want to use

511
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,440
from your sound system to your font rendering, right?

512
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,440
And so I knew I liked this from this distro.

513
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,220
I like this from this distro.

514
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:56,200
And at the end, even though it's labeled Arch Linux, it's basically Chris's OS.

515
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,600
It is exactly like my custom built system.

516
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
And so what?

517
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,760
Two things.

518
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,200
On a rolling release, the more complex your GUI is, you know, Gnome and KDE, the more

519
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,200
complex it is, I got to believe the more higher likelihood it's going to break on a rolling

520
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
release.

521
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:18,200
So there could be motivation when you're using a rolling release to stick with a more simple

522
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,880
streamlined window manager that something like i3 or Awesome because it's less likely

523
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,880
to break.

524
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,100
So I think that could be one motivating factor.

525
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:32,880
But second of all, like Polymath is saying here, he's pulling in the terminal programs

526
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
he likes.

527
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,640
He's pulling in the file manager he likes.

528
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,000
He brings in the compositor that he thinks has the fanciest or whatever effects he likes.

529
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And he is essentially taking that philosophy of building your core Linux system and he's

530
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,300
bringing it all the way up to building the whole entire desktop environment, right?

531
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,180
It's like the ultimate customized system.

532
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:58,000
It's like you custom build your car and you even custom build the dashboard display, right?

533
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And I guess that's what it is.

534
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,800
I think the dashboard display is really what people are into, I guess, with this.

535
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
That's tough.

536
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Yeah.

537
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
I get it.

538
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
Because I get it.

539
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,320
Because like with Arch, it's like I totally get that because it's like you're customizing

540
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
your experience.

541
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,600
With this, you must be customizing your user experience, but it just seems so minimalist.

542
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,360
I guess that's kind of what you're going for.

543
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
I don't know.

544
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,720
KZ 50 Cents in the chat room is that TWM can really look cool, but dang, Chris Ellis needs

545
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,000
his KDE Connect.

546
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You know what?

547
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
He jokes.

548
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
But I like my KDE Connect.

549
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,200
I like my widgets and I like my photo slideshow on my desktop, right?

550
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,880
I like having my CPU meters on the desktop and in my menu bar.

551
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,320
So I mean, because for a lower end machine or an older computer, I can totally see going

552
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,480
minimalist as much as possible, but for a higher end machine, it's just kind of like

553
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,640
I would have to understand the psychology behind the reasoning behind it more.

554
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,680
From a financially sensible standpoint, from a practical standpoint, from a system resources

555
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,160
standpoint, I can totally understand it.

556
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,080
But from a...

557
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,080
I want Shiny.

558
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,080
Yeah.

559
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
And here's why.

560
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:08,880
I'm not qualified in wanting Shiny because I have lived through all of it, okay?

561
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,600
So you're not...

562
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,680
It's not quaint for me.

563
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,080
It's not quaint for me to have the computer that can't figure something out, where I have

564
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,680
to tell it to do something.

565
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,520
That's not fun.

566
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,160
That's something computers should be good at by now.

567
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,880
And I sit in the camp where I want my goddamn window to wiggle because damn it, I lived

568
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:33,400
through a time when we didn't even have separated GPU cards, and then we had Matrox video cards,

569
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,680
had to have special video games, and you had to have all of these special drivers.

570
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,600
I lived through all of it, and now I want to reap the rewards of being there on the

571
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,720
front lines, trying everything out, pushing things forward, talking about them, experiencing

572
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,360
them, blowing my money on crap that never worked out, but the few things that did succeed.

573
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,760
I have worked so damn hard over the last 15, 20 years.

574
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,960
Why would I forfeit all of that now to just give it all up?

575
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,460
And it's not that I don't...

576
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,160
I just don't disparage anybody who chooses to do so because there are completely legitimate

577
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:12,720
reasons that I just laid out, but for me personally, I feel like kind of like going back to Thor,

578
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,480
I have defended the realms, I have earned my right to party now, and I want to party

579
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,520
like it's 2013.

580
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,640
Is that so crazy?

581
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,300
Is that really so ridiculous?

582
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,600
Just because I run Linux doesn't mean I shouldn't party like it's 2013.

583
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
I don't think it's crazy.

584
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
I think it's pretty reasonable, actually.

585
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,840
It's interesting that there's a collective mindset for that.

586
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,560
And there's certainly, again, I'm still trying to understand the desire to go with that whole

587
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,000
minimalist point of view, but for me, yeah.

588
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,180
Why do we feel like we have to make do unless there is actually an advantage to that that

589
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,180
we're not aware of?

590
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,180
Right.

591
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,180
No.

592
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,180
My desktop should be as absolutely freaking badass as possible.

593
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:56,000
That's why I am personally willing to spend a $500 premium or whatever it is to buy a

594
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,120
machine that is resource capable of delivering that, and when I cannot afford to do so, I

595
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120
just don't buy.

596
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
Right.

597
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
Right.

598
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,180
And then I, you know, anyways, I just, so, but here's what I'm willing to, I was very

599
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,000
opinionated about the whole Arch thing to begin with.

600
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,160
I think if you look back at 2013, that was obviously a big lesson for Chris and Matt

601
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,000
was this whole, yeah, right?

602
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,160
So I'm totally willing to give the tiling window managers a go because I do grok the

603
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,760
benefit of like extending that custom built feeling all the way off to the very top to

604
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,400
layer seven right there with me.

605
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
I get it.

606
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,440
I'm willing to give it a go because at the end I might walk away and say, oh my God,

607
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,720
everybody, the real light is totally tuning in the perfect desktop that makes you the

608
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,720
ultimate product, productive son of a bitch, right?

609
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Oh yeah.

610
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
And then I'll be all on board.

611
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,400
But until that point, right now I'm just saying from somebody who hasn't jumped into the tiling

612
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,000
window manager challenge yet, I think you guys are a bunch of crazy son of a bitches,

613
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,400
but I'm willing to jump in with you.

614
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,600
Well, so it's like, okay, imagine Tron re-imagined with the awesome window manager.

615
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,200
Are you going to want to see that on the big screen?

616
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,200
Wow.

617
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,960
That, that, that literally looks like flash Gordon from the forties or thirties or whatever

618
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
the hell it was.

619
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,160
It's just kind of like why, you know?

620
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,880
But again, there may be something to these windows managers that are besides performance

621
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,400
increase that I'm not aware of.

622
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,560
Maybe it's, it does something for me that I'm just not cluing in on.

623
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,560
You know, I'll tell you one of the things when I sit down in front of a Mac that drives

624
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:24,480
me totally wonky crazy is like the totally mixed keyboard support.

625
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,600
I do totally grok.

626
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,560
Like, and honestly, when I sit down in windows, like I love back when I was a consultant,

627
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,560
I loved the problems when the mouse wasn't working because I was like, F yeah.

628
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
What's up?

629
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
It's all keyboard time.

630
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
Cause everything was just right at the keyboard.

631
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,120
And I can totally see how that's great on a tiling window manager.

632
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,360
I love the F out of that on KDE.

633
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,480
So maybe I'll, you know, I'll throw away my mouse, I'll become one with the keyboard and

634
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,120
it's tiling managers from here on out.

635
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,260
But we won't find out until early into 2014.

636
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,240
Let those gray hairs start coming into the beard there.

637
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Yeah.

638
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,560
I mean, total graveyard on it.

639
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,560
You know, I don't know that that's, that's a toughie, but I definitely think that it's

640
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,460
going to be interesting to see how that pans out.

641
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,460
But I don't know, man.

642
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,460
We'll try it.

643
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,460
We'll find out skeptical.

644
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:08,000
It'll be a, I don't know when, cause we got like, we got a lot of things coming up, but

645
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,200
I want to tell you about something else I'm passionate about and that is Ting.com now

646
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,520
Ting are sponsors right here of Linux Unplugged.

647
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,880
Ting is mobile that makes sense because there's no contracts, there's no early termination

648
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
fee.

649
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
And here's the part that makes the most sense.

650
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
You only pay for what you use.

651
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,740
It's a $6 flat line and then it's just, they just take your messages, your minutes and

652
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,900
your megabytes and they add it up at the end of the month.

653
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,960
You buy your phone, you own it outright.

654
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,800
And what's brilliant about Ting is not only do they have a support staff of Canadians

655
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,800
ready to answer your call as it comes up, Ting is from the guys that made two cows.

656
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,640
They've been changing this stuff for a long time.

657
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,840
Everything Ting gets into or everything two cows gets into, they really want to make a

658
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,840
difference.

659
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,400
Ting is very passionate about this because they feel there is big changes to be made

660
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,040
in the mobile industry and let's be honest, there are.

661
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,360
Because all of these mobile plans you buy into adds a ton of waste to your monthly budget.

662
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,400
You pay into some sort of minutes or megabytes you don't end up using or you go over where

663
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,680
Ting will just take your messages, your minutes and your megabytes, add them all up at the

664
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,680
end of the month.

665
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,880
Whatever bucket you fall into, that's what you pay for.

666
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,320
Unlimited devices on your account for just $6 per month.

667
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,560
So if you're a small business, if you're a family, if you're a team of folks, you can

668
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,560
make it super easy.

669
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,880
If you're a developer or if you're IT support and you need to have multiple iterations of

670
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,600
Android devices or Blackberry devices or Windows to phones or even the iPhone 4 or 4S which

671
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,640
now work on Ting and you want to have them on one account so that way you can test things

672
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,840
for your clients, for your apps, whoever it is, Ting makes that super easy because you

673
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,040
only pay for what you use on those devices.

674
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,560
Add a whole bunch on your account.

675
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,720
You just pay that flat $6 and then what you use on top of that.

676
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,480
That makes testing super straightforward plus when you combine that with the Ting dashboard,

677
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,320
you're really cooking with gas because it's a super simple interface that also gives you

678
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,880
tons of controls from activating, deactivating devices, setting up call forwarding, voicemail

679
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,880
rules.

680
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,480
Matt, when you signed up for Ting, did you call or did you use the online dashboard completely?

681
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,100
I used the online dashboard completely and that was what was awesome because even when

682
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:02,680
I had to basically deattach you from it and then reattach myself from it, I was able to

683
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,360
figure out how to do that completely from their help file or their help section which

684
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,320
is super easy to use and literally did that, boom, done, completed, refreshed my dashboard.

685
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
I was good to go.

686
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,080
I couldn't believe how stupid simple it was.

687
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,080
It was great.

688
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,400
You know, when I got my Nexus 5 from the Google Play Store, it came in the Ting portfolio

689
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,280
and in there they had just a little business card.

690
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,280
You pull out the business card.

691
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,240
It says go to Ting.com like slash activate or something like that and it's just step

692
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,560
by step by step all through the web interface.

693
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,420
I never had to call but I always know if I get a position where I need to call, a real

694
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,920
support representative, if you call between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern will answer that

695
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,160
phone and they really are empowered not only to solve the problem but they're actually

696
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,740
enthusiasts of Android and all the other mobile devices that Ting carries.

697
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,760
That's something they specialize in which is really kind of peace of mind.

698
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,680
You recommend to family, you know, that kind of thing.

699
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:54,120
Well and totally the one takeaway if I could like institute one thing to everybody and

700
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,000
just really push this forward, they don't live on scripts and having dealt with the

701
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,240
various companies recently that are script based, you're going to love that.

702
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,240
Alone.

703
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,680
I mean that by itself just makes my day.

704
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,440
Yeah Ting hires their support representatives are folks who are champions of mobile and

705
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,280
Android in their peer groups and so Ting says why don't you come work for us and help out

706
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
our customers.

707
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,280
So here's how you get started.

708
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
Go over to linux.ting.com.

709
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:23,000
That'll take $25 off your first month of service or it'll take $25 off your first device if

710
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
you don't have one yet.

711
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,200
They are an MMO of the Sprint Network so if you have good Sprint service in your area,

712
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,920
you're going to get amazing Ting service.

713
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:35,880
Go to linux.ting.com and a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

714
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,040
Alright so brace yourself for this one guys.

715
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:47,480
I've got the Times, the Time Magazine top 10 tech gadgets of the year.

716
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,320
Number 10, I won't go through all of these, don't worry, it's not going to be that boring.

717
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,160
Number 10, the Nokia Lumia 1020, okay, it's got a good camera, I mean it does, it has

718
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
a good camera.

719
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,360
Well that's like saying a cinder block has a great camera.

720
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,360
I mean okay, you take a cinder block and I tape a really great camera to it, but really?

721
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,600
Xbox One made number 6, Apple iPhone 5S made number 5, Pebble Smartwatch number 4, Oculus

722
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:20,200
Rift number 3, Apple's new iPad number 2, but the number one Time Magazine gadget of

723
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:27,160
the year is the Google Chromecast, a Linux based device.

724
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,160
Can you hear that?

725
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,880
Honestly, can you hear the sound of the residual checks being cached?

726
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,240
I can.

727
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,560
So I have a Google Chromecast and Matt, I've got to be honest, I have not really had an

728
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,560
opportunity to try it out.

729
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,920
I just don't understand why, I genuinely don't get why anyone, I don't understand.

730
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,600
How about this, Sunday, remind me, why don't you take my Chromecast home and try it out?

731
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,440
I'll try it out because maybe I'll hate on it, because for me it's just kind of like,

732
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,440
if you don't have an existing option, okay cool, that's awesome.

733
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:59,880
So here's the advantage, okay, so it's a little device, you plug into your HDMI port, you

734
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,520
also need to have USB power nearby or they include an adapter.

735
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,040
It runs Gen 2 Linux with a Chrome OS binary that runs in the background, and from your

736
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,840
Android device you can come across a Netflix video, a YouTube video, Plex now has support

737
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
for Chromecast.

738
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,600
Oh, okay, well now I'm starting to care.

739
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
Right?

740
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,520
Okay, so picture this, you take the Plex app, you put it on your Note 2, okay, because first

741
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,000
of all, Note 2 has an amazing screen for watching Plex videos.

742
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,920
So but $35 for the Chromecast, okay, so you could put a Chromecast on every TV in the

743
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,520
house that has an HDMI port for $35, you start Plex on the phone, you select your video,

744
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:47,800
you hit play, you say send to Plex, or you say send to Chromecast, it sends the commands

745
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,560
and it creates the connection between your Plex server and the Chromecast directly, and

746
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,520
then you can turn your phone off, and now you don't have to have a Roku, you don't have

747
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,000
to have anything else, you just have to have a $35 Chromecast connected to your TV, and

748
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,480
you can send your Plex media to it, you can send your Netflix, your music, those kinds

749
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,480
of things.

750
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,600
So the differentiator as far as like why you and I would care, for example, is that for

751
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,400
us right now to run Plex, we're actually using a computer.

752
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
I'm using or a Roku.

753
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Or a Roku, yeah, well, I mean, for the computer to stream.

754
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,920
You still have to have a Plex server, you still have to have a Plex server with the

755
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
Chromecast.

756
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,920
Right, exactly.

757
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,720
Okay, so even with the Chromecast you still have to have a Plex server then, because that

758
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,280
was really my big thing, is that it sounds like, because I know there's actually AirPlay

759
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,560
options for Roku, be it they're not awesome, I mean, they definitely have a long way to

760
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,040
go, but yeah, I'm going to have to play with it and really wrap my head around it.

761
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,040
There's another limit, though.

762
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,040
What?

763
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,160
The Chromecast Plex support requires the Plex subscription to send anything at all through

764
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,160
Plex.

765
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,160
Yeah, you've got to have the Plex Pass.

766
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,160
Yeah.

767
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,160
That's fine.

768
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,160
I mean, Plex is so awesome, it's just usual.

769
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,640
I have a Plex Pass because it is so awesome, but here's what Time Magazine says.

770
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,040
They said, instead of trying to do everything, like Google's famously ambitious and unsuccessful

771
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:59,480
Google TV, this thumb-sized gizmo does one thing and does it simply as possible and does

772
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,720
it for the impulse purchasing price of $35.

773
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,200
Plug it into one of your TV's HDMI ports and you can fling videos and other content from

774
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,040
your laptop, your tablet, or your phone to the big screen with no wires involved.

775
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,360
Lots of companies have built devices to do this, but Chromecast is the first one to get

776
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,360
it right.

777
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:24,320
But another important point to point out, wow, is you can get an extension for Chrome

778
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,040
and you can send individual tabs to Chromecast.

779
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,640
Now that I care about.

780
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,920
So you're saying that I could go to like abc.com and actually send that to my account.

781
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,920
Now I care.

782
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
Right.

783
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,920
Now I care.

784
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,920
That doesn't work very well, though.

785
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,920
I would expect not to work too well, but...

786
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,920
Question, though.

787
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,440
Why couldn't you just get a $5, 10-gig USB stick and put XB and C on there?

788
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:50,240
Like XB and C would do or something like that on there and it would be way better.

789
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,440
Well, I mean, for us, yes, but for the average user, what we have is we have a really big

790
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,920
problem in the living room and Chromecast is, first of all, it's solving the price point,

791
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:09,800
but the beauty is, is everybody's got a smartphone now and all you need is the $35 Chromecast

792
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,960
and a smartphone.

793
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,240
They see each other like some kind of internet magic and you just push a button on your smart

794
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,520
device and it just sends it to your TV and it is very simple and I'll be honest, until

795
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,120
you've tried it, it doesn't sound like it's that amazing, but we've got an iPad and an

796
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,120
Apple TV.

797
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,160
Well, not anymore, but we used to have an Apple TV in the house that my dad got me for

798
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,840
Christmas a couple of years ago, which I don't have anymore, but...

799
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,840
Oh, yeah.

800
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,840
We got a jailbroken one.

801
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Yeah, totally.

802
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,240
That whole like you're on the iPad and you push one button and all of a sudden everything

803
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,320
you're watching on the iPad, on the TV, and it is so effing seamless and then you can

804
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,520
like continue to use the device for other things.

805
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,840
It honestly feels like the effing future.

806
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,720
It feels like what 2013 should feel like and Chromecast brings that down to $35 and anybody

807
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,320
that wants to build that into their Android app.

808
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,480
It's interesting because like a lot of people probably don't know this, the Roku, I think

809
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,600
it's the Roku LT, oddly enough, experienced a recent price drop to I think $35, oddly

810
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
again.

811
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,560
Obviously, the timing is just perfect for that.

812
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,360
So it's going to be interesting to see how they stack up because I think I have one of

813
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,760
the XT or whatever the hell it is.

814
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,060
And just to kind of get an idea on performance, what its capabilities are, does it really

815
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,060
woo me?

816
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,040
Because I'm a rabid Roku fan.

817
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,880
The problem is all of these things are not, in my opinion, good enough.

818
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,640
So first of all, the number one problem with the Chromecast is tied to Google.

819
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,280
I don't like that.

820
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,860
Second problem with the Chromecast is it's tied to Android.

821
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,200
Not a huge fan of that.

822
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,640
XBMC is great, but doesn't solve the AirPlay-like functionality, and I think that's a big gap.

823
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,640
It is.

824
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,840
I run XBMC on my old jailbroken Apple TV, and honestly, ever since moving to Plex, I

825
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,960
just don't really use it anymore.

826
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:55,400
It does actually solve the XBMC thing, or XBMC solves it because I'm building a project

827
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
to solve it.

828
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Tell me about it.

829
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,400
What do you mean?

830
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,120
I'm calling it XBeamMC.

831
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:06,760
So you beam the stuff from your laptop or your desktop to XBMC and play it however

832
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,760
you want.

833
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,320
It's going to support everything that you're talking about, like YouTube.

834
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,360
For Chromecast, you require Plex to do local files, so you require a subscription to do

835
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,360
local.

836
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,220
Otherwise, Chromecast can't do local files.

837
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:28,300
For XBMC, it supports everything that XBMC can support, so MKVs, MP4s, whatever.

838
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,240
Local files, internet files, streaming.

839
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,960
So it's just like an app you install in XBMC?

840
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,320
No, it's an app for Linux.

841
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:40,800
So you load XBMC on top of Linux, and then on the Linux system, you install the XBMC

842
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
beam, the XBeam...

843
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:47,200
Right, but it also works with any kind of XBMC, regardless of what you put it on.

844
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,680
So it works on Raspbmc, like the Raspberry Pi and things like that.

845
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,120
So you can just right click on YouTube, send to XBMC, it'll send it to it and start playing

846
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,120
immediately.

847
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,120
Very cool.

848
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,400
Sounds rather cool.

849
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,760
What is the ETA?

850
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,320
Probably like a week or two weeks.

851
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
Nice.

852
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
Cool.

853
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,320
Keep us posted, Dennis.

854
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,720
And it plays from where you're at on your local...

855
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,440
It'll pick up from wherever you're at?

856
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,080
Doesn't start the video over?

857
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,560
It depends.

858
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,560
If you're...

859
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,380
It can kind of do that, but it's really...

860
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:22,800
If the plugin for XBMC supports that, it can do it.

861
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,440
If that plugin does not, it will not.

862
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,400
See, that's important for me, and what I really dig about the Chromecast is podcasts and videos

863
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,760
that I'm watching on my way home, I walk inside and I put them on my TV.

864
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,200
So it like picks up where you left off.

865
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,320
What app are you using to do that?

866
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,320
That's just Chromecast.

867
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,200
So it's a YouTube thing.

868
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,800
But oh, so you're watching like...

869
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,040
So say you'd watch Linux unplugged on YouTube and then...

870
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,240
Yeah, it's usually you guys.

871
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:51,720
So it's whatever podcast, BeyondPod on my Android or whatever through Chrome I'm doing.

872
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,480
Does BeyondPod support Chromecast?

873
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,480
It does if you pay for it.

874
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,640
Well, I'm interested in the plugin myself.

875
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,680
I'm interested in seeing how that works with XBMC, because that appeals to me.

876
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,440
I like the fact it's not Google.

877
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,680
Mine will also support the time thing for YouTube, so that you can play it, but it might

878
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,040
not for other ones.

879
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,080
But I'm going to try to support it as much as I can.

880
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,920
But the main thing is like the first version might not have all the features that Chromecast

881
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,000
does because I'm not Google.

882
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,480
Exactly right.

883
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,960
You kind of lack the billions of dollars and endless resources, totally.

884
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,720
It feels like though, here we are, like Google is getting closer to cracking this problem

885
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,360
than Myth TV has, than XBMC.

886
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:39,440
Well, I don't know if that's appropriate, but like for the masses, right?

887
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,440
This whole...

888
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,420
The whole like the smarts and intelligence and the picking and the content selection

889
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,760
is all done from the mobile device.

890
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,200
And then the Chromecast is really like this totally stripped down little arm device that

891
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,680
just plays the stream.

892
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,500
Okay, well here's my thing about the casting of tabs.

893
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,200
It's experimental right now and buggy, but as much apps as Google isn't trying to move

894
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,240
to inside the browser, so eventually your apps will just move with you onto whatever

895
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,800
device you've got your Chromecast plugged into.

896
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,020
Well, that's one of the cool things about it and maybe even Netflix at some point can

897
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,020
do that.

898
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:21,720
But for right now, like for example, Amazon is a horrible experience because it does not

899
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,720
work.

900
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,880
So you can kind of like give it some work around and like wiggle it around and it sometimes

901
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,360
will work, but for most time it doesn't.

902
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:36,360
Well, I do SSH sessions in my browser on people's computers that I don't want to install anything

903
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,360
on.

904
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,200
I can just within Chrome do an SSH session and it's really interesting to be able to

905
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,400
see what else I'm going to be able to Chromecast.

906
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,320
Well, to me, I mean the thing is like the Chromecast in a sense almost solves the front

907
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,200
end problem.

908
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:57,460
To me, the Plex solution seems like the superior solution because I take one of these $35 dongles

909
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:02,140
and I plug them into my HDMI TV and then I have a central Plex server that has one centralized

910
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:07,160
library of all of my media, one index, everything's, if it's marked watched once on TV, it's marked

911
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,040
watched everywhere else.

912
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,880
It's all one place plus it has the mobile aspect where I can watch videos out on the

913
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,520
go on my mobile device.

914
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:20,920
It seems like to me, Chromecast is going to usher in, I don't want to say this, but I

915
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,720
think it begins to – I think it's the first nail in the coffin of things like XBMC

916
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,720
and Myth TV.

917
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:35,320
Well, the XBMC thing is that what Chromecast brings to the same – like XBMC does all

918
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:40,940
this stuff but the problem is that it requires you to install the piece by piece to make

919
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,040
it all work.

920
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:46,200
Like there's for saying something has been watched, you can do that but it requires a

921
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:53,760
plug-in for that and for like mine, it requires – my app is going to require certain types

922
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,760
of plug-ins.

923
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,480
For example, XBMC does not come with YouTube by default.

924
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,480
You have to install the YouTube plug-in and it all works just fine.

925
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:06,640
It's just there's a kind of an introduction kind of thing you need to know how to install

926
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,120
the plug-ins and things like that.

927
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,840
Well, I also think they're two totally different audiences too because if you think about it,

928
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,880
I mean Chromecast is essentially, like it or not, it's a hardware appliance.

929
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,560
I mean it really at its core really is.

930
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,200
It's something you physically plug into your TV.

931
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,200
Right.

932
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,200
Isn't that perfect though because it's not a whole computer.

933
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,200
It's not a PC.

934
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,200
Yeah, it is.

935
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,200
No, that's good.

936
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,200
It's $35.

937
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,360
Yeah, but XBMC, it's like Plex didn't kill XBMC and they're related, I mean they're

938
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,360
cousins to each other.

939
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,000
They're based on some of the same code and all that or a lot of the same code but the

940
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
point is –

941
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,760
I don't know if it will kill it.

942
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:41,920
But how much of the price of the Google device is offset by Google's plans to make money

943
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,120
off it from advertising or selling media and other things?

944
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,120
Right.

945
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,120
Oh, yeah.

946
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,120
Let's Google track.

947
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,120
Yeah.

948
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,120
Tracking your TV habits.

949
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,120
But the average user doesn't know that though.

950
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,120
Right.

951
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,320
I'm just saying that it will be hard for someone else to build a competing device to

952
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,680
the Google one because they can't afford to lose money on it by Google again.

953
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,680
Right.

954
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,680
Exactly.

955
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,680
That's true.

956
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,680
Well, XBMC also works on Raspberry Pi.

957
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,480
And you can't kill XBMC because it's open source.

958
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,520
So like naturally, there's always going to be somebody that's going to want to continue

959
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,520
it.

960
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,520
It's kind of a different approach.

961
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,720
It's kind of a different approach to the same problem but one thing I've been waiting

962
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,840
for for a long time now is Wi-Fi direct on Linux because, I mean, you get a wireless

963
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:24,400
display straight from your laptop but Intel refuses to support it under Linux.

964
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,440
But if they did, I could just hit a button on my laptop and have everything on my laptop

965
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,440
on my TV.

966
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,760
And for that, that would solve it for me.

967
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,760
Yeah.

968
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,760
Not everybody has embraced Wi-Di.

969
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:38,440
And I feel like the Chromecast is still – like it's just at $35, it really is that impulse

970
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,960
purchase price on Amazon.

971
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,800
Like I add it to my cart, I just buy it and it doesn't matter if my TV has Wi-Di support

972
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,800
or DLNA.

973
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,640
All they need is an HDMI port and I know my Android device can support it.

974
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,880
And I feel like now that Plex has supported it, it is now incumbent upon XBMC to support

975
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:59,640
transmitting to the Chromecast or they're going to get left behind because it is – let's

976
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:07,280
be honest, I love XBMC but if I can get almost the same exact results and actually, in some

977
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,580
cases with my kids, it's easier for them to use a tablet, it would actually be easier

978
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:15,760
for them to start a video on a tablet and send it to a Chromecast than to use XBMC.

979
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,040
I'm going to just buy a bunch of Chromecast.

980
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,040
There's actually a way to do that with XBMC and Android.

981
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:29,320
It's a replacement app instead of using the official remote control app which is terrible.

982
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,320
Use something called Yahtzee.

983
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,320
Oh, I've got that.

984
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,320
Yeah.

985
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,320
Yeah.

986
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,320
Yeah.

987
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,680
So it has the same kind of features and it has a bunch of other things that are just

988
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,600
awesome but it does have the ability to send like YouTube stuff from your Android device

989
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,480
to XBMC, no matter what your XBMC is built on.

990
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:55,480
I just hook up my laptop to my TV and use my phone to control the XBMC.

991
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,880
The thing I kind of see this as all is one is software solutions and the other one is

992
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,380
a hardware solution.

993
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:05,840
The Chromecast is a hardware solution and it has its bonuses in that right but it also

994
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:10,720
has the downside in the fact that, once again, this is something that people are going to

995
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:16,120
buy and think, oh, my Chromecast is outdated because I don't have the V2 Chromecast.

996
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,120
Whatever.

997
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,920
Well, things like XBMC, things like that are going to be around, are going to be installable

998
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,920
on new devices.

999
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,080
Is that an issue when it's $35 and it seems like it's pretty much just a streaming recipient

1000
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,680
so as long as it can handle a 720p or 1080p stream, it doesn't have to be that complex.

1001
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:33,720
It'll probably last quite a while.

1002
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:38,920
Well, it's like you're at the point with XBMC and you still, you get updates, you get everything

1003
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,080
and it's essentially the same price point.

1004
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,080
Right.

1005
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,080
You don't have to go through Google.

1006
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,080
I agree.

1007
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,440
Someone should package that up and sell it as an appliance.

1008
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,440
This is what I'm saying.

1009
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,560
Well, someone in the chat room actually put up something called Airtame.com and essentially

1010
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,360
this is the Google dongle.

1011
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,640
I mean, I'm reading this over and it's like, this is the same freaking thing.

1012
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,640
Yeah.

1013
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,720
They essentially bill it as wireless HDMI for everyone.

1014
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,720
This is cool.

1015
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,720
I'm looking this over.

1016
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,240
With Airtame HDMI dongle, you can display your computer screen for Mac, Windows or Linux

1017
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,440
on your TV or projector wirelessly.

1018
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,440
Now this is...

1019
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,440
An Indiegogo thing.

1020
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,440
Yeah.

1021
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,440
Yeah.

1022
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,280
It's in crowdfunding mode, but it kind of does solve the problem, doesn't it?

1023
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,280
Yeah.

1024
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,280
And apparently they got their funding.

1025
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,280
So that's cool.

1026
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,280
Oh yeah, they did.

1027
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,280
Didn't they?

1028
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,280
They got over 186% of their funding.

1029
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,560
And they still have 31 days left.

1030
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,400
The issue is that this doesn't exist yet.

1031
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,920
It does not exist yet, but it's an interesting alternative.

1032
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,960
And it also kind of speaks to the fact that there will always be an alternative.

1033
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,480
But at the end of the day, between like XBMC and going with the Google dongle as well,

1034
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,080
totally different audiences of people.

1035
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,560
Really at the end of the day, Chris's wife, my wife, they don't give a rat's behind about

1036
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,560
XBMC.

1037
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,560
They don't care.

1038
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,560
They just want to watch TV.

1039
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,560
Just make it happen.

1040
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:57,920
And however we can as end users make that happen for the others in our house, great.

1041
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,280
Otherwise if they're just doing it on their own, they're going to go with the complete

1042
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,240
solution, whatever that happens to be, I think.

1043
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,240
Yeah.

1044
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:10,000
Well, the benefit of mine is that, of XBMC and the way it's built is that with my project,

1045
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,080
people can look at the code of my project and then see how you can send something XBMC

1046
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,080
and put it on whatever they want.

1047
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,080
Right.

1048
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,080
That is cool.

1049
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,080
Totally.

1050
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,400
What we need somebody to do is proctize the XBMC platform so that applications like yours

1051
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,120
have an opportunity to shine.

1052
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,240
Like Chromecast has productized streaming for Android devices.

1053
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,080
And let's be honest, really Chromecast is a response to the Apple TV because Airplay

1054
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,200
has been in iOS since like what, iOS 4 or 5?

1055
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,200
Yeah, something like that.

1056
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,560
So I mean, they're actually behind the ball on this, but they've really nailed on something.

1057
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,840
I mean, they got Time Magazine's number one gadget of the year, for whatever that's worth.

1058
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,200
The PR they get is so...

1059
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,200
It tells you something though.

1060
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,200
It tells you there's a demand.

1061
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,040
Oh no, there's definitely a demand.

1062
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,120
But it's comical because I say the Roku should have been more.

1063
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,120
So I don't know.

1064
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,120
I'll review it.

1065
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,120
It also runs Linux.

1066
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,120
Yeah.

1067
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,120
Yeah.

1068
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,800
It also runs Linux and it's quite frankly, back when it was the Netflix box generation

1069
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:06,120
one Roku, which I still have by the way, my rather now gone stepfather used to run this

1070
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,040
and he didn't know anything about any computers or anything else and he was able to run it

1071
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,040
with no problem.

1072
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,360
Even as it evolved, it was always usable for all generations of people.

1073
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,880
So yeah, I don't know.

1074
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,000
I think this is just a me too product based on my early impressions, but maybe not.

1075
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Question.

1076
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:27,240
Can you root or unlock the Chromecast and install a straight up XBMC on it?

1077
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,200
I guess there was like a way to do that, but then an update got pushed out, sort of nuked

1078
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,200
it.

1079
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,200
It'll be like that.

1080
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,200
It'll be like that.

1081
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,200
It'll be like that.

1082
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,200
There was a crack to it.

1083
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,200
I still have the original OS.

1084
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,200
That's evil though, isn't it?

1085
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,200
No.

1086
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,200
That's not evil.

1087
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,200
Not evil.

1088
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,200
Not evil.

1089
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,200
I still have the original OS on my Chromecast that I'll lend to Matt.

1090
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,200
Matt can kick it around.

1091
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,280
Yeah, because I'll definitely be brutal on it.

1092
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:50,240
I mean, I'll be very honest about my experience with it because I'm the rabid Roku person.

1093
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,360
I have a feeling it is one of those things that you are skeptical of until you get it

1094
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,640
and then you're like, wait a minute, this is really easy.

1095
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,640
Right.

1096
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:02,160
Well, it's just like, because it is very easy to be like, I'm going to go down to the living

1097
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,600
room and I'm going to watch something.

1098
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,360
So as I walk into the living room, I take my Note 2 out, I start the Netflix app, I

1099
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,640
find the movie I want to watch, I tap play, I send to Chromecast and by the time my TV

1100
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,280
is turning on, the Chromecast is already streaming it.

1101
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,600
Let me ask you this because this will decide it for me right here because this is what

1102
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,720
is going to come down to my wife.

1103
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,120
How does Ange compare it to the Roku?

1104
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,120
What's her impression?

1105
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,760
Well, no, she hasn't tried it yet, but she's totally comfortable with selecting media on

1106
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,760
her mobile device.

1107
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,760
Sure.

1108
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,400
So as long as you're comfortable doing that, when you have a Chromecast on your network,

1109
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,920
a new button shows up that you just tap and then you say, send to Chromecast.

1110
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,920
Interesting.

1111
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:36,920
Okay.

1112
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:42,240
I don't want to be annoying about it, but is it okay if I shield my website for the

1113
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,240
project?

1114
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,240
Yeah, totally.

1115
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,240
Absolutely.

1116
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,240
Definitely.

1117
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,240
It's xbeamc.com.

1118
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:53,720
The site right now is not ready, but by the time this is aired, it will be.

1119
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,720
X-B-E-A-M-C.

1120
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,720
Okay.

1121
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:01,240
Is there an email alert or RSS or something just to kind of keep people up to date?

1122
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,240
You know what?

1123
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,240
You should put a link in the subreddit too.

1124
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,240
There will be tomorrow.

1125
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,240
Yeah, okay.

1126
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,240
When your site is live.

1127
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,240
I'm posting the subreddit every time.

1128
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,120
Yeah, put it in the subreddit when your site is live and people can upvote it and check

1129
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,120
it out.

1130
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:15,320
Isn't all of this just attempts at trying to do what we want is that our application

1131
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,040
should go from device to device seamlessly?

1132
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,040
Convergence?

1133
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,040
Basically, yeah.

1134
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,040
Hello.

1135
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,040
Basically.

1136
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,040
I don't know.

1137
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,400
I don't know if it's that.

1138
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:33,640
I really don't need my gedit document or my kate document to go between devices, but

1139
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:37,800
I do need my blu-ray rip of bolt to move between devices.

1140
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,920
Are you sure you don't want your document between devices?

1141
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,600
Well, I probably do, but I never really can see.

1142
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,680
All of a sudden you're going to want to, if you're writing your show notes on your desktop,

1143
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,680
then you want them to show up on your tablet so you can use it as a teleprompter.

1144
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,680
Sure, sure.

1145
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,680
Only cloud.

1146
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,680
But I never need it on my TV.

1147
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,680
No.

1148
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,680
Are you sure?

1149
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,680
No.

1150
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,680
Yeah.

1151
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,680
I'll never, you never know.

1152
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,560
Maybe I'll be in the studio one day and I'll want notes up on a big TV screen, so actually

1153
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,560
I shouldn't say that.

1154
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,560
I could see that happening actually.

1155
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,240
Well, with Docs you could do like a presentation method.

1156
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,080
Are you talking about Google Docs?

1157
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,520
No, I'm talking about.

1158
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,440
If you wanted to send a doc to a TV, you could do it for like presentation, so like you could

1159
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,720
do like PowerPoint or something.

1160
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:14,720
Yeah.

1161
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,720
That's true.

1162
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,840
Well, I was thinking actually for Chromecast, I tried, so where my Chromecast is right now,

1163
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:22,560
it's plugged into the back of my broadcast machine because I thought it would be a cool

1164
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:27,880
way to send the tab that I'm currently looking at during Linux Unplugged to the Wirecast

1165
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:36,280
machine because right now I have no way of, Wirecast supplies an add-on product called

1166
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:41,000
Desktop Presenter which allows you to capture your screen and transmit it over the network

1167
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,840
and it comes into Wirecast as a camera device.

1168
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,520
Extremely handy, very nice feature.

1169
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:50,680
Obviously it's Windows and Mac only, doesn't work under Linux, but the Chromecast, if I

1170
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:55,000
had a physical HDMI device plugged into the back of my Wirecast computer and then I had

1171
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,240
the Chrome extension installed on my Chrome browser and I could transmit my tab to the

1172
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:05,640
Chromecast, I would then have a way to over the network send the contents of my Linux

1173
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:10,660
Desktop browser session to my Wirecast machine and I thought that would be great, but I couldn't

1174
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:11,660
get it to work.

1175
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,320
I don't know why.

1176
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,740
So there's potential there, but I think actually a lot of internet producers could find use

1177
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,880
for that and we'll see what happens.

1178
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,880
All right.

1179
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:27,160
Well, I got an email I wanted to get into before we wrap up for this week's episode

1180
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,480
and maybe the Mumble Room will have a few, I don't really have anything for this one,

1181
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,560
so I'm going to pitch this to the Mumble Room.

1182
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,520
It came in from Jonathan and he says, I really need some help.

1183
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:44,680
I got a comic book collection of around 2,000 issues and I used Comic Collector Live over

1184
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:51,920
at ComicCollectorLive.com or ComicCollectors at ComicCollectors.com software for cataloging

1185
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,680
my collection, but I've recently switched full time to Linux.

1186
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,720
Of course, good man, as he should, morally so.

1187
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:04,360
I had thought about redoing my database until recently, I found nothing useful for my needs.

1188
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:08,240
I'm willing to spend money if I can get a good program, but I can't find anything.

1189
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:13,320
Please, help a geek out and let me know, is there something in the Linux community for

1190
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,520
cataloging comic book or graphic novel collections?

1191
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,160
These are not physical books, they're downloaded comics.

1192
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,160
Thanks.

1193
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:24,600
So Mumble Room, anybody in here have an app they use to organize their comic collection

1194
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,600
on Linux?

1195
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,800
I use comics, it's a C-L-A-M-I-X.

1196
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,800
Yep.

1197
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,800
Yeah, that's a good one.

1198
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,840
You can also use Calibra.

1199
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,840
Calibra Office?

1200
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,840
No, no, no.

1201
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,840
It's a collections office.

1202
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1203
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,840
Calibra.

1204
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,840
Okay.

1205
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,840
All right.

1206
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,240
So, C-O-M-I-X is the one I'm the most familiar with.

1207
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,240
I'm not familiar with Calibra.

1208
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:48,840
If I'm not mistaken, there's an X-D-N-C plug-in to actually view comics, too.

1209
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,840
Seriously?

1210
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,840
That's awesome.

1211
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,840
That is really good.

1212
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,840
All right.

1213
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,840
What's the other one?

1214
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,840
He does it in a slideshow manner.

1215
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,840
Somebody link me the other comic, the Calibra one, and I'll put that in the show notes.

1216
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,840
It's supposed to be pronounced Calibra, apparently.

1217
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,840
Calibra.

1218
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,840
Okay.

1219
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:03,840
My bad.

1220
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,840
My bad.

1221
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,840
It's an e-book.

1222
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,840
It's the e-book reader.

1223
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:14,520
The guy who wrote it was an engineer, I think Stanford, and he wrote this as an e-book management

1224
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,560
app.

1225
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:21,320
He just happened to get it at the right time when nobody else had written one.

1226
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,600
It's the only e-book app that everybody uses.

1227
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:29,340
Many of the e-book reader manufacturers like Kobo and Sony and all that, they recommend

1228
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:37,720
you use that application, and he only takes donations via a link in the app, and people

1229
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,720
send him money.

1230
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,720
It's extremely good.

1231
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,720
It's really, really good.

1232
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,720
It's really, really good.

1233
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,720
Okay.

1234
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,720
It supports comic books.

1235
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,720
There's CBZ files and things like that.

1236
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,720
CBR files.

1237
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,720
I think it supports everything.

1238
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,720
Everything you can imagine.

1239
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,120
I think it even supports barcode readers, if I'm not mistaken.

1240
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,120
It's been a while since I've looked at it.

1241
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,120
It does.

1242
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,120
Really?

1243
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,120
The add-ons are amazing.

1244
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:59,320
Yeah, I have one of those little Wildcats or whatever the hell the little... It's shaped

1245
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,320
like a cat.

1246
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,320
I can't remember what the hell it was called.

1247
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,320
You get them unlocked from eBay.

1248
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,320
It's totally spot on.

1249
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,320
It's still in interactive development, too.

1250
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,320
They just had a release on the 13th.

1251
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,320
Yeah.

1252
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,320
It's good software.

1253
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,320
Well, that's good.

1254
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,320
QCat?

1255
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,320
Yeah, QCat.

1256
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,320
Thank you.

1257
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,320
Yes, that's exactly it.

1258
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,320
Yeah, I've got one of them around here somewhere.

1259
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,320
Got an unlocked one.

1260
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,320
I've got like 150 of them.

1261
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,320
Yeah, that doesn't everybody.

1262
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,320
That's awesome.

1263
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:24,080
Sorry, I also use the Wiki generator.

1264
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:28,080
There's a plug-in available for it where you can quite literally specify an e-book page,

1265
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:32,920
and it will auto-generate you a PDF on that exact page, including references and all links

1266
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,920
available.

1267
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,920
Very nice.

1268
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:41,200
Peacemaker in the chat room says, also, there is an Android app that works with Cleebray

1269
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,960
called Beam, which will kind of look like a Chromecast effect.

1270
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,320
It'll beam books from your Android device.

1271
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,320
That's pretty cool.

1272
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,320
That's interesting.

1273
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:53,560
Now, back in my day, we used cardboard boxes and plastic bags and index cards, and that's

1274
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,560
how we actually kept that.

1275
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:57,640
I mean, this is back before computers were a thing, but yeah.

1276
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:02,760
You know, I am more inclined, personally, I would be, actually I am, without question,

1277
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:09,880
I have a much larger digital comic collection than I have, I have like, probably total,

1278
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,880
I have a dozen comics, maybe, and they're all Star Trek, I'm going to be honest, they're

1279
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:14,880
all Star Trek.

1280
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,080
I sold all my stuff off when I was like 17, 18 for gas money, so.

1281
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,080
Right.

1282
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:22,360
Just a quick clarification, that thing for Android that Peacemaker is talking about,

1283
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,920
it's called Calibre Companion.

1284
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:24,920
Oh, okay.

1285
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,920
Calibre Companion.

1286
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,920
And it lets you beam them.

1287
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,680
He was using the term beam to kind of talk about what I was called, mine is called.

1288
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,680
That's cool.

1289
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,680
That's cool.

1290
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:33,680
So, all right.

1291
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,680
And that's in the Play Store, I would assume.

1292
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,680
Cool.

1293
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:43,560
So, I have amassed a small collection of digital comics myself, and I just kind of go, I just

1294
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,400
do it all by the directory structure, which is not very interesting.

1295
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,400
Not very.

1296
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,400
Yeah.

1297
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,400
That works for you, right?

1298
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,040
It does work, because I don't have a huge collection, but I could see if you had thousands,

1299
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,760
I could see how that could get a little unmanageable.

1300
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,720
Oh, yeah.

1301
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,720
And they can.

1302
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,560
My collection was, it filled a room, let's put it that way, but again, I pissed it away

1303
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,600
on girls and gas back in the day.

1304
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:07,560
See, what I do right now is I store it in Dropbox, and then I have an app on my Android

1305
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,960
device that, or on the iPad too, I suppose.

1306
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,600
I've never tried on the iPad, but it probably works just the same.

1307
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:17,920
There's devices that will connect in a Dropbox, and then import all of the CBR files, and

1308
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,200
then do them that way too.

1309
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,800
So that's how I've always managed it.

1310
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:21,800
Right.

1311
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,920
I've never really been all that motivated to sit on my computer and read something on

1312
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,640
the screen for an extended period of time.

1313
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,640
Yeah, I can either.

1314
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,640
Like that.

1315
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:32,440
I know, we have a Kindle proper, like the old school Kindles.

1316
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,280
That's definitely, I'll do that any day over the week for overbooks, no question.

1317
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:40,820
But not like on an Android device or something like that, not so much.

1318
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:45,960
One thing I do is I manage all my books in Caliber, and then it lets you beam your books

1319
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:50,640
from Caliber to your Kindle over the internet, because you can set up a Kindle email address.

1320
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,240
Well you get one just for having a Kindle.

1321
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,360
And once you set it up in Caliber, you just select the book in your library that you want

1322
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,680
to read, and it sends it directly to your Kindle.

1323
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:02,280
If you have 3G, then it doesn't even matter if you're connected to the Wi-Fi, it just

1324
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,280
works all the time.

1325
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,280
Nice.

1326
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,280
That's kind of cool.

1327
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,280
That is kind of cool.

1328
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:11,120
Okay, thank you for letting me know, because then I could put it on the Kindle, I could

1329
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,800
go sit down on the couch and read it on that e-ink display, which would actually be pretty

1330
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:15,800
cool.

1331
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:16,800
All right, Matt.

1332
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,120
Well, I think that'll kind of wrap us up.

1333
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:22,000
I just finished a book last night.

1334
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,600
I was driving home from watching Thor.

1335
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,560
I don't know if you've noticed the Thor references.

1336
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,460
Thor 1 or 2?

1337
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:29,880
It's Thor Dark World.

1338
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:30,880
It just came out.

1339
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:31,880
It's in the theater right now.

1340
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,440
I went and saw it with my buddy John last night.

1341
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,680
And it was a good movie.

1342
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,280
And on the way home, I finished an audio book, and I just want to make a pick, because I

1343
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,840
know the holidays are coming up, and sometimes people have a little extra time on their hands.

1344
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:47,200
A lot of shows you might listen to are wussing out, and they're taking the holiday off, and

1345
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,240
so you need that content.

1346
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,320
There's a book I want to recommend for you.

1347
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,560
It is an Audible book, and I'll put the affiliate link in our show notes.

1348
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:55,800
If you get this, you do support the show.

1349
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:02,080
It's called Star Trek X The Lost Years, and it is a story of what...sort of a side story

1350
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:07,480
of McCoy, Spock, and Kirk, and what happens between the end of Star Trek, the original

1351
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,760
series, and Star Trek, the motion picture, the movie.

1352
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,760
Oh, nice.

1353
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:15,320
Yeah, a little background, and why Spock decides to take the Kulinar, and if you don't know

1354
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,200
what I'm talking about, then go screw yourself.

1355
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,400
But if you know what the Kulinar is, then this is a book you should go listen to.

1356
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,520
I follow you completely.

1357
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,180
Here's what's awesome.

1358
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:26,880
Narrated by James Duhon, Scotty, and Leonard Nimoy.

1359
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:33,680
James Duhon is actually...one of the secret talents that James had is he was really a

1360
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:38,240
lot of the voiceover talent for the motion...I'm sorry, for the animated series.

1361
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,560
Of course, Scotty was an accent.

1362
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,440
He was sort of an expert at doing different voices.

1363
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:50,920
He reads this book, and it is so engrossing because he assigns each character their own

1364
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:56,980
dialect, their own...I mean, he just owns every single character, and then whenever

1365
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:59,840
Spock comes into the story, it's voiced by Leonard Nimoy.

1366
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,840
So I'll play a sample.

1367
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,840
That's cool.

1368
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:15,440
That's fantastic and let me know if the next book, that you want me to find some remixes

1369
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:26,440
And the healer who had nursed him for several days left him both signs that he would be dead before sunrise.

1370
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:34,440
The relief on the healer's drawn face was evident. She had attended her patient with loathing and terror.

1371
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:52,440
For this was Zakhle the Terrible, the greatest of all the Kolonar masters, with a mind so powerful he had twice used it to incinerate his enemies into ashes at his feet.

1372
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,440
So that's James Duhon right there doing the reading on that.

1373
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,440
That's incredible. He was so awesome.

1374
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,440
He's really giving it all he's got. It was so good.

1375
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:06,440
And the sample mixer has the music background audio a little higher than it actually is in the book.

1376
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:15,440
And what's cool about what Audible lets you do is you buy the book and if you use our trial and you sign up, if you decide to cancel when you click our link, you still get to keep that book.

1377
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,440
And the Android app and the iOS device app are really nice.

1378
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:24,440
And if you have multiple Android devices or if you have like an Android device and a Kindle, it will sync position among them.

1379
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,440
Oh wow, that's awesome.

1380
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,440
Yeah, so you can pick up where you left off between devices.

1381
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,440
It's an abridged version. It's only two hours and 56 minutes.

1382
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:42,440
So I wanted to toss this out there because if you have a little extra time over the holiday season and you want essentially something that's like a podcast or something that's the length of Unfilter and the Supporters Show, you could go grab this.

1383
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:47,440
It's Star Trek X, the Lost Year Star Trek, I guess the 10, I don't know why they call it that.

1384
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,440
Star Trek the Lost Years. I'll have a link in the show notes.

1385
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,440
I just finished it last night.

1386
01:04:51,440 --> 01:05:00,440
And it really kind of bridges the gap between what happened from the end of the original series and Star Trek the motion picture and as a fan of Star Trek, obviously, that was pretty cool for me.

1387
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:04,440
I know it doesn't apply to all Linux users, but that's your mistake, not mine.

1388
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,440
All right, Matt.

1389
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,440
Well, that just about wraps up this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1390
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:11,440
Of course, we'll be back here next Tuesday live over at jblive.tv at 2pm Pacific.

1391
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:16,440
Go over to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that in your local time.

1392
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,440
And don't forget, we want to hear from you.

1393
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:24,440
Go over to jupitabroadcasting.com and pop that contact link, choose Linux Unplugged from the dropdown and give us your feedback.

1394
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,440
You know, Matt?

1395
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,440
Yes?

1396
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:31,440
I was thinking on Sunday, it's the end of the year, it's the last Linux action show of 2013.

1397
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,440
It's time to look back at our 2013 predictions and make our 2014 predictions.

1398
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,440
So I think that's what we'll be doing on the big show.

1399
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,440
So I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

1400
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,440
See you Sunday.

1401
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,440
All right, everyone.

1402
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,440
Well, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1403
01:05:43,440 --> 01:06:00,440
See you right back here next week.
