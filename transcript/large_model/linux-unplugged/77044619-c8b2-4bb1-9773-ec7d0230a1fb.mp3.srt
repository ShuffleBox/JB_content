1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Dang it, my Rona hair is getting ridiculous.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,080
God, it's just in my face constantly.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,000
You just need to glue it down.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,320
But then it gets all gnarly,

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,160
and it gets all hard and greasy.

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,120
Chris, last dreads, I think, is what's about to happen.

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,480
So then I go for the nothing in the hair thing,

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,080
so that way it doesn't get greasy,

9
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,840
but then it's just all over the place.

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,040
And when it's like poking me in my eyes and my forehead,

11
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,120
I can't focus.

12
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,080
And everybody says, you'll get used to it.

13
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,900
Well, guess what?

14
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,760
It's been like a solid month, and I'm not used to it,

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,160
so I don't think I'm ever gonna get used to it.

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,960
My damn hair needs to get cut,

17
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,220
but I just, I haven't got it.

18
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,800
You know, there's like,

19
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,900
there's better reasons to go out during a pandemic,

20
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,160
and my own vanity doesn't seem like a good enough reason,

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,000
so I just haven't done it,

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,200
but now it is driving me crazy.

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,240
Well, if it starts to affect your productivity.

24
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,120
That's usually the way I talk myself into everything.

25
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,480
Right, that's why you need ice cream tonight.

26
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,480
Hello, friends, and welcome into episode 364

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,320
of your weekly Linux talk show.

28
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,160
My name is Chris.

29
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,000
My name is Wes.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,820
Hey, Wes.

31
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,660
Hello.

32
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,600
Nice to see you there.

33
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,580
Nice to see you there.

34
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,420
Hello, cheese.

35
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,240
Hello, Drew.

36
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,300
Hello, internet.

37
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,140
Hello.

38
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,240
Nice to see you there.

39
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,460
Everybody really dressed down from last week.

40
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,460
Like last week, everybody was excited and they dressed up.

41
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,800
Biologist in your shorts.

42
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,000
It's hot this week.

43
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,180
That's true, that's true.

44
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,500
Well, we have a big episode.

45
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,200
We're gonna get into some community news,

46
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,060
and then we're gonna discuss the past, present,

47
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,640
and future of Linux on the ARM platform,

48
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,200
which has become of a little more interest recently

49
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,240
with Apple's news, but additionally,

50
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,920
there's just some significant things that are in the works,

51
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,540
even within the last couple of days

52
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,240
as we record this episode,

53
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,080
that we thought the timing was right to do that.

54
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,760
So we'll get to that in just a moment,

55
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,120
but before we do that, time-appropriate greetings,

56
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,960
Mumble Room.

57
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,800
Hello.

58
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,240
Happy Linux Tuesday.

59
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,080
Hello.

60
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,600
31 people hanging out in that Mumble today.

61
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,440
Beautiful.

62
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,260
That is pretty great.

63
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,100
Hello, everybody.

64
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,200
Good to have you there,

65
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,240
and say hello to the new terminal on Chrome OS,

66
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,500
which is shipping in Chrome OS 84.

67
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,120
It's been completely revamped as a system web app,

68
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,660
and it adds a new settings menu

69
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,240
and a bunch of customization.

70
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,920
I think Chrome OS just got really serious

71
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,900
about the Linux terminal.

72
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,240
Yeah, right, it's even got tabs built right in.

73
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,360
Well, now you know they're serious, Wes.

74
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,800
Tabs, you say?

75
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,640
That's how power users get work done, Chris.

76
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,960
Oh, man, could you imagine the meeting

77
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,680
where they're discussing the new power users

78
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,800
they're gonna add to Chrome OS,

79
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,720
and you know, like, tabs was on the whiteboard.

80
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,360
I will say, you know, this continues to make me

81
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,120
more and more curious about Chrome OS,

82
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,160
in that having a usable, configurable terminal

83
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,480
is probably one of the things I would want

84
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,660
if I was gonna actually be using it day to day.

85
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,040
Yeah, and they invested pretty heavily

86
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,560
in the Crostini environment,

87
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,580
and have added significant functionality to it over time,

88
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,760
and now they're improving the user interface to that.

89
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,020
It seems to be a fairly significant through line

90
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,880
of continued investment in the Linux environment

91
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,120
for Chrome OS, and I think the message here is,

92
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,160
this could be your simple, no-hassle,

93
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,880
plug right into your corporate environment

94
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,640
development machine, and that sounds ludicrous,

95
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,040
unless your corporation uses Google Apps,

96
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,320
and all of a sudden, this thing's plugging right in.

97
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,280
It's got your calendar, it's got your inbox,

98
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,360
it's got your cloud storage, it does your Google meetings,

99
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,360
and it's got a terminal.

100
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,040
Right, you can go, you know, hop onto your Google Cloud VPS

101
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,680
and start getting work done.

102
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,240
Oh, what a Google Cloud future it is, Wes.

103
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,040
And it's just, I think, remarkable,

104
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,400
because it's a clear strategy

105
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,960
that has been adopted by Microsoft.

106
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,360
Their manifestation of it is WSL,

107
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,960
which is a much more sophisticated implementation,

108
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,200
but Google is able to take a few shortcuts here

109
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,520
since they're using the Linux kernel,

110
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,280
and so they're able to sort of respond

111
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,800
competitively very quickly.

112
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,840
It's interesting to see them converge

113
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,540
on similar ideas, though.

114
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,360
Yeah, and I wonder, just because we are gonna be talking

115
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,480
about ARM today, I wonder how this impacts the Mac platform.

116
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,980
They seem to be getting further away

117
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,840
from making it possible to run Linux applications

118
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,160
outside of virtualization.

119
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,000
Right.

120
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,180
And there does seem to be, in the latest builds of Big Sur,

121
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,240
there does seem to be specific OS improvements

122
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,880
to enable Linux virtualization.

123
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,720
Did you see that?

124
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,560
Yeah, isn't that interesting?

125
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,240
But, I mean, it does make sense.

126
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,880
You gotta have Docker, you gotta have things like,

127
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,400
you know, developer productivity tools

128
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,720
if you're gonna have developers use your platform.

129
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,400
How much do you think it's about Docker?

130
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,040
Right, right, yeah, yeah.

131
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,400
It's probably mostly about being able

132
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,280
to run Docker containers really easily.

133
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,040
But then you may see other lightweight virtualization suites

134
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,440
that sit on top of a set of APIs that Apple's creating

135
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,080
to make Linux virtualization easier.

136
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,960
If it works smooth enough, I suppose,

137
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,920
you might not even notice.

138
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah, yeah.

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,360
All right, well, let's shift gears to Manjaro.

140
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,160
This week, there was an announcement

141
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,920
in the change of the team composition,

142
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,100
and it happened in a fairly public way,

143
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,880
and it appears to involve the use of finances

144
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,560
and community-contributed funds.

145
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,080
And so that always gets everybody's attention.

146
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,940
And Philip is joining us from the Manjaro project

147
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,640
to walk us through his side of what happened

148
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,440
and kind of get a better understanding

149
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,480
of the greater context here.

150
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,240
So Phil, I don't know if my characterization is correct,

151
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,840
but it seems to me that there was a disagreement in the use

152
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,040
of funds to buy a fairly high-end laptop

153
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,640
for a maintainer on the project, not yourself.

154
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,160
And it seems that there was a process that was followed.

155
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,200
That process didn't work out, and so then the decision

156
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,020
was made by yourself to proceed anyways

157
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,960
with the purchase of the laptop, which

158
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,200
led to a disagreement that fairly rapidly went public,

159
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,000
maybe before the conversation was even complete.

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,320
And now people don't really know what to believe.

161
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,840
Well, the laptop is for a community developer who

162
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,800
is mostly based in Germany, and he is presenting Manjaro

163
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,360
at several trade shows.

164
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,280
So everybody in Germany at least know him,

165
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,040
and the laptop was actually about 1K.

166
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,620
And we added two hard drives because he

167
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,680
has a special backup system.

168
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,200
And he extended the RAMs because he is simply

169
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,020
doing all the testing and installs several Manjaros

170
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,280
on his machine, and he needs that.

171
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,160
And it looked like you guys took a look

172
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,780
at doing an 18-month contract with a cloud provider

173
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,920
to do the builds.

174
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,840
And you look at the cost, and it sort of just

175
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,000
works out to just end up buying the laptop, plus then

176
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the developer has a machine to actually use as well.

177
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,200
So I think that totally makes sense

178
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,240
and seems like a pretty reasonable laptop

179
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,520
for a development workstation, especially one that's

180
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,320
showcasing the distribution at events once they resume.

181
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,200
I guess what a lot of people seem

182
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,840
to be thinking something foul happened

183
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,400
is with the stepping outside the process for the purchase.

184
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,860
So I'll tell you my interpretation

185
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,680
of it from an outsider, and then you tell me where I land.

186
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,960
But I looked at this situation, and I said, well, it

187
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,520
seems maybe there's some personal things going on

188
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,720
between some team members, so that could

189
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,840
have some influence here.

190
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,480
But is it possible that the project created

191
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,520
a very rather convoluted process to handle expenses,

192
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,400
and then that process failed?

193
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,200
And then as a project leader, you

194
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,680
decided, well, this is a necessary expense

195
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,020
for the good of the project.

196
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,040
Is that essentially the events that happened?

197
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,680
Essentially, kind of.

198
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,320
But Matthew's also here.

199
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,560
He is one of the community developers,

200
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,200
and he can also show you his side.

201
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,360
It was accepted by the whole team.

202
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,240
We talked about it, and even the guy who didn't approve it

203
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,380
also agreed on the laptop itself,

204
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,200
but slightly disagreed with the additional configuration.

205
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:50,160
So there was a process, but not like everybody on the team

206
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,880
can discuss with him.

207
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,080
So we said, it doesn't work like that.

208
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,040
And since I started the project, it's

209
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,480
really important also to me to have the developers give

210
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,240
their goods so they can develop.

211
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,720
Matthew, for example, has a laptop not working,

212
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,160
and he's still in the team.

213
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,400
And we are now currently looking for a working laptop also

214
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,920
for him.

215
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,720
So a lot of purges will happen, and the process

216
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,080
is currently due.

217
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,680
And Matthew can tell you about what the community board will

218
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,040
do for the next thing.

219
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,400
I mean, that actually tracks pretty closely

220
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
with what I would think would happen,

221
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,800
is sometimes a process is created for the project,

222
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,520
and that process doesn't necessarily

223
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,880
serve the project's end goals.

224
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,360
And so it needs to be modified.

225
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,520
Tell me if I'm wrong here, but I think maybe where

226
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,440
the breakdown was is instead of modifying the process to make

227
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,320
it possible for the purchase to happen via process,

228
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,680
the process was just sort of bypassed,

229
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,880
which is sometimes necessary when

230
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,560
you don't have a lot of time and a lot of energy to mess around.

231
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,560
But that seems to be sort of like the core problem there

232
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,800
is the process wasn't really serving the project

233
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,720
as you saw it.

234
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,920
And it sounds like what you're sort of saying there,

235
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,040
and maybe I'm misunderstanding, but it

236
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,560
sounds like you're saying there's maybe a new process that's

237
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,880
being developed now.

238
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,040
Yes.

239
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,480
Since I'm more part of the company,

240
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,080
I give Matthew more or less the freedom

241
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,560
to decide what he thinks for the community project.

242
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,720
And yes, we will see how that works out.

243
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,280
The funds are secured now.

244
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,560
Everything is safe and sound.

245
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,160
And we can only move forward from now on.

246
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,960
And it seems like this probably means long term you'll

247
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,240
have a better representation of what it actually costs

248
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,600
to run a team of developers.

249
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,120
Exactly.

250
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,600
We will be more visible.

251
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,120
And also the team members who are not known yet

252
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,560
might appear in podcasts, shows, YouTube channels, whatever.

253
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,760
It depends also what to do.

254
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,160
Mati is joining us as well.

255
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,120
Yes, I'm here.

256
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,640
Hello, sir.

257
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,280
So do you want to chat at all about what you kind of have

258
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:57,760
in mind?

259
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,360
I know it's super early days and still,

260
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,320
but it sounds like maybe a new process will be put in place.

261
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,040
Any insights you can share?

262
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,680
One thing I would like to say about what happened,

263
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,040
I think it's a bit misleading or a misconception

264
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,720
to say that the process was bypassed

265
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,560
or that the process was convoluted.

266
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,400
Because I think the problem with the previous way

267
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,640
that things were processed wasn't so much

268
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,560
that it was convoluted, but it was kind of unclear

269
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,640
for the team.

270
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:36,680
And it was mostly run by the developer who left our team.

271
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:42,080
And now we're coming together as a team to make a new process.

272
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,840
So we're making sure that everybody is on board

273
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,320
with how the things work.

274
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,280
And everybody knows what to do.

275
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,840
Which should be a lot more sustainable, I would imagine.

276
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,720
I think this, in long term, or actually not very long,

277
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,960
it's going to lead to a better process about this.

278
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,360
I think that's probably what Jonathan wanted anyway.

279
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,160
Fair point.

280
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,520
Is there a plan to communicate the expectations

281
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,840
to the Manjaro user base?

282
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,160
Because I have to imagine part of this

283
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,000
is people are getting a snapshot of a conversation,

284
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,080
essentially one side of a conversation,

285
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,480
that is being responded to.

286
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,560
And I wonder now you must be thinking

287
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,720
it'd be good to get ahead of this for the next time.

288
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,640
Yeah, it's going to be better when

289
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,320
we have finalized the process and decided

290
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,840
how we're going to do it.

291
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,160
Then we can make it public and show that how

292
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,320
the process actually works.

293
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,960
I think there's going to be much more transparency

294
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,440
with the project and the use of the donation funds.

295
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,240
Yeah, I'm glad to see that.

296
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,840
Whatever we can get to a sustainable place

297
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
so the project is healthy, continues, and can actually

298
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,320
use the resources that it has.

299
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,440
That's what I think everyone in the community wants to see.

300
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,920
So we'll have links in the show notes

301
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,320
to the announcement and both sides of the discussion.

302
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,960
Also, the item itself, you talk about transparency,

303
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,760
to your credit, is on Open Collective.

304
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,080
The expenses documented there.

305
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,440
The process has been, I would say, somewhat transparent

306
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,960
just in that regard.

307
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:19,760
It seems like these situations, I've been on the side of,

308
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,480
so somebody comes out and starts talking

309
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,160
before something's supposed to be public,

310
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,600
and they end up setting the narrative.

311
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,880
And the language that they use sets

312
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,760
the tone of the conversation that happens on Reddit

313
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,240
and in Telegram groups and on IRC rooms and wherever else.

314
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,320
And it then becomes the onus of the other party

315
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,600
to either defend themselves or just remain silent,

316
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,440
which is usually my trick.

317
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,440
And that's a difficult position to respond from.

318
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,040
So I really appreciate you guys willing to just come

319
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,200
on the show and just answer any question I throw in your face

320
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,680
and respond to it genuinely because I

321
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,120
know you've probably been getting

322
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,240
a lot of negative criticism.

323
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,840
And I appreciate your transparency

324
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,480
in just doing this part of this process.

325
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,680
And when I said convoluted, I didn't mean it as an insult.

326
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,360
I just meant when you're beginning

327
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,040
and you're starting up as a project,

328
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,840
you have an idea of how things will work,

329
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,520
and you create a process and chains of command and whatnot

330
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,720
that maybe a year or two into it or whatever it might be,

331
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,600
you realize with hindsight, well, that structure

332
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
doesn't really make sense.

333
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,080
That's not really how this works.

334
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,160
And so at some point, there has to be a change.

335
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,960
And generally, it's some kind of event like this

336
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,560
that forces that change.

337
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,520
And sometimes people do get their feelings hurt.

338
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,120
And it really sucks to be on that side of it.

339
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,280
So I appreciate that position.

340
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,040
And I appreciate you coming on the show, guys.

341
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,120
And we'll keep an eye on the situation.

342
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,360
And best of luck, Philipp.

343
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,760
Is there anything else you want to chat,

344
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,640
like any teases of future developments

345
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,400
that you want to get out there or hardware sneak peeks?

346
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,560
Well, we're working on several projects.

347
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,880
So currently on the PinePhone, in winter,

348
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,840
we might have our own community edition.

349
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,400
Then a new mini PC with an Ryzen CPU will come.

350
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,360
And of course, more Ryzen CPUs based laptops from Tuxedo

351
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
and under and other partners.

352
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,480
So how much is known about this mini PC?

353
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,120
How much can we share that you and I've

354
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,240
talked about this mini PC?

355
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,400
Because that seems pretty exciting, is it?

356
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,240
Is it pretty locked in as likely to happen?

357
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,000
Well, we have a new partner in China

358
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,720
and is one of the biggest manufacturers of mini PCs.

359
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,720
We will sell it in Amazon, US, and EU

360
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,400
and have it there when it's ready.

361
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,280
So we will see.

362
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,000
To recap, I'm really excited because this

363
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,120
is a Ryzen-based system that's smaller

364
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,480
than a Mac mini that has some really nice performance

365
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,360
characteristics.

366
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,520
And it's going to be available to buy on Amazon preloaded

367
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,280
with Manjaro.

368
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,520
That's so cool.

369
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,480
That's a pretty big deal.

370
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
Wow.

371
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,680
I mean, here in the States, that's like, well, OK.

372
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,560
That's a possibility.

373
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,920
All of a sudden, it's like, hmm.

374
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,360
I mean, I look at, we have a couple of machines

375
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,800
in the studio here that are getting seriously old.

376
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Like, the recording machine actually

377
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,600
had a hard drive problem over the weekend

378
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,220
that I was able to recover and mark the blocks bad.

379
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,520
But that's the beginning of the end.

380
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,640
And I think, OK, it's time to replace this machine.

381
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,420
Something like that that I could order on Amazon when

382
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,400
the computer dies and I can have in a couple of days?

383
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,320
Game changer.

384
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,520
And it would fit nicely in the studio.

385
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,060
We don't need a giant tower in here.

386
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,560
No.

387
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,080
It's something low profile we could have under the table.

388
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,360
Anyways, again, thank you guys for joining us.

389
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,240
And keep us posted on future developments,

390
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,440
because it seems like there's a lot going on

391
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,520
and some cool hardware in the works.

392
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,680
So thank you very much.

393
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,640
And I just, by the way, recently reloaded my workstation

394
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,560
upstairs with Manjaro Gnome Edition.

395
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,320
It had started as Manjaro XFCE.

396
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,120
Then I switched over to Plasma.

397
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,920
Of course you did.

398
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,960
And then I switched over to Gnome Shell.

399
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,280
And then over the weekend, because I was in here just

400
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,600
like doing computer stuff, I was doing an update

401
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,840
on my workstation.

402
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,560
And I was doing it in retro CRT, because it's awesome.

403
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,960
You just feel like a badass admin.

404
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,840
And watching your packages go by on a cool retro CRT screen

405
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,760
is great.

406
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,080
During the actual installation of the packages,

407
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,240
Gnome Shell crashed on me, dropped back

408
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,640
to the login screen, killed my terminal session

409
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,320
that was running the update.

410
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,480
So I see I'm not even going to mess with it.

411
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,920
I drop to the shell, do like the Control-Alt-F2 or whatever.

412
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,800
I get on just the full screen shell.

413
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,160
I log in, Pacman SYU, all packages up to date.

414
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,160
No, they're not, because I was watching them install, right?

415
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,840
So I do a Pacman clean cache, thinking like,

416
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,320
just clean everything out, redownload all the packages.

417
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,760
Let's just start over again.

418
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,240
We're just going to hit Go again.

419
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,480
Does the whole operation.

420
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,120
Takes a minute cleaning stuff up.

421
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,480
Do the Pacman SYU.

422
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,120
No updates available.

423
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,920
So now what do I do, right?

424
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,960
Because I know it's not done.

425
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,680
But Pacman's pretty convinced it's done.

426
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,600
Switch to Fedora and DNF.

427
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,320
It's funny you say that, because that legit,

428
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,960
when I reached for the thumb drive,

429
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,460
and I had the thumb drive in my hand,

430
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,800
I'm like, what do I flash this with?

431
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,360
And I thought, you know, DNF, this wouldn't have happened.

432
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,920
But this is what I get for doing updates

433
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,200
in a cool retro GPU accelerated terminal.

434
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,560
Let's be honest, I should know better.

435
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,440
So I can't 100% blame Pacman in this case.

436
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,200
So I decided I got no other option.

437
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,800
I've got to reboot.

438
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,120
And sure enough, the system just does not come up.

439
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,760
And I'm thinking, do I try to recover here?

440
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,520
Do I just switch to Fedora?

441
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,360
And I just decided, I don't want to do upgrades of distros.

442
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,240
I just want to keep my packages up to date.

443
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,880
I just want fresh packages.

444
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,000
So I decided to stick with Manjaro again for a bit.

445
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,400
Oh, and then honestly, this sounds really lazy of me,

446
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,280
because flat packs and snaps are not hard.

447
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,200
But I just kind of like having one package

448
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,440
manager for everything.

449
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,000
It is nice.

450
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,560
I mean, it's just slightly simpler

451
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,200
when you have such wide support in your package management.

452
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,800
And there's a bunch of crap I got

453
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,640
to install that's like Slack and Telegram.

454
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,880
And now I even have a reason why I have to have Teams and Outlook.

455
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,920
Well, I use the web app.

456
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,200
But it's bad.

457
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,660
It's getting to the point now where

458
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,920
I have so many weird apps.

459
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,280
Big old mess of software.

460
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,200
I think it's more stuff that's outside the repo that's

461
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,720
in the repo these days that I use on a regular basis.

462
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,420
And so it's just nice to have one package.

463
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,880
So I just went to GNOME Shell, Manjaro edition,

464
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,800
and loaded it up there.

465
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,440
And it's great.

466
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,160
It's nice.

467
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,720
Isn't that nice?

468
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,280
I mean, if you had a traditional Archbox,

469
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,400
you'd have to reinstall, which might take you a bit.

470
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,320
But with Manjaro.

471
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,120
Yeah, I still have to load a bunch of stuff.

472
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,960
But I really don't mind the default configuration.

473
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,640
I, of course, turn it into dark mode.

474
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,680
Naturally.

475
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,000
Although I'm starting to get a little done with dark mode.

476
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That's a topic for a future show.

477
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,500
I know.

478
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,000
I know.

479
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,680
But when you go all in on dark mode for so long, it starts to.

480
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,600
That's like your personal brand.

481
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Well, I'm still using it.

482
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,360
As you can clearly see, everything in front of us

483
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,120
is currently in dark mode.

484
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,320
I thought that was going to be a new handle, dark mode Chris.

485
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,360
The dark tipper.

486
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,320
Anyways, so yeah, it's back up.

487
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,200
It's a fresh install.

488
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,360
It feels good.

489
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,520
I do like doing that from time to time anyways.

490
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,880
But it was funny to sit there with literally the thumb drive

491
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,840
in my hand and go, hmm.

492
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,240
It's a big moment of decision.

493
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,280
All the power right there.

494
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,480
And then I run through this.

495
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,960
I would totally go to Fedora for DNF.

496
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,360
And then I'm like, but then I have

497
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,200
to install a dozen flat packs and all that kind of stuff.

498
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,440
And it's just not that it's impossible.

499
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,040
It's a lot.

500
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,960
Sounds like you need a better FS underneath there

501
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,920
for your snapshots.

502
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,080
I did actually choose better FS this time

503
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,320
through for my main partitions.

504
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,320
I've never really done that with an arch install.

505
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,280
So yeah, it's all better FS.

506
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,760
It's all of the disks.

507
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
And there's a lot of disks in that box.

508
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,720
It's got like six attached disks.

509
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,120
I'm looking forward to whatever updates we get down the road

510
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,320
here in a couple of months.

511
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,960
It's pretty great so far.

512
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,080
I actually like it a lot.

513
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,780
I like that you've built this strange machine that

514
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,880
seems to just constantly be stress testing Linux.

515
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,000
I know.

516
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,240
It's a weird configuration, and you keep finding these fun

517
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,720
little bugs.

518
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,040
And then like a jerk, I just insist

519
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,480
on having two vertical monitors, which

520
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,800
I don't think any developer of Linux desktop

521
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,880
has because it is always so wonky.

522
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,280
Anyways, that's my update.

523
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,240
It was one of those Sundays where

524
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,640
I came in for the LUP lug predominantly

525
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,520
because it happens every Sunday.

526
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,440
Hey-o.

527
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,360
So I came in a couple hours early and was like, well,

528
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,640
I'll just bang out a couple of things real quick.

529
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,040
And literally up until like two minutes after the LUP lug

530
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,240
started, I was still fixing the various computer

531
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,000
stuff around the studio.

532
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,400
And then I hung out in the LUP lug for like, I don't know,

533
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,200
two hours, hour 45.

534
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,800
Once you start, it's hard to stop.

535
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,300
It is.

536
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,920
You get sucked in.

537
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,640
All right.

538
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,000
Well, let's do a little housekeeping real quick,

539
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,880
and then we'll get the show back in gear

540
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,360
because we do have a lot to get to still, big show.

541
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,460
So really, really quick, I do just

542
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,080
want to mention the LUP lug is on Sundays at noon Pacific.

543
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,360
It's on our calendar at jupiterbroadcasting.com

544
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,560
slash calendar.

545
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,640
So you can just kind of get our live times.

546
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,400
And you never know.

547
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,000
There may be new live shows popping up

548
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
on that calendar soon.

549
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,440
So do check it from time to time.

550
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,320
Also, you are welcome to join this show live.

551
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,040
Please do.

552
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,400
We do it Tuesdays at noon Pacific,

553
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,520
which is 3 PM Eastern.

554
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,000
You got any other time zones you just

555
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,440
want to randomly throw out there?

556
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,120
We should just pick.

557
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,600
3 AM if you're in China.

558
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,320
I don't know how you knew that.

559
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,520
It's just so funny.

560
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,440
And we'd love to have you join us if you can.

561
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,040
And then you can participate in the mumble as well,

562
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,400
or the chat room, or just watch however you like.

563
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,960
And you can get all of that at jblive.tv.

564
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,040
And we also have that full screen IRC.

565
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,800
If you just want to jump in our chat room really easy,

566
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,800
lazy style, go to bit.ly slash Jupiter chat.

567
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,880
And that is all the housekeeping I have.

568
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,080
Nice and tidy today.

569
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,520
Quick and easy.

570
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,600
All right, well, let's talk about ARM.

571
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,880
Let's specifically talk about the past, the present,

572
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,400
and the future of Linux on ARM.

573
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,080
I think this is a little more convoluted than I expected.

574
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,320
As we record this episode, convoluted is my word today.

575
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,120
Did you notice that?

576
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,620
Yeah, it is.

577
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,800
As we record this episode, Intel has

578
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,680
announced a major restructuring of the corporation.

579
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,200
And they've also announced that they

580
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,960
will be delaying, again, their 7 nanometer process, which

581
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,020
is kind of embarrassing because they couldn't really

582
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,440
get 10 nanometer down for more than a couple of lines.

583
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,600
And so they were essentially punting that problem

584
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,640
by going straight to 7.

585
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,280
We'll have 7.

586
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,320
We'll have 7.

587
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,640
And now they can't hit 7.

588
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,240
Meanwhile, TMC is ramping up for 5 nanometer production

589
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,400
for the new Apple chips and some other ARM CPUs.

590
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,940
Right, and of course, there's all the intricacies

591
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,520
around what do those sizes really mean

592
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,020
and the differences in the processes.

593
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,480
But just continued failure on the Intel side

594
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,440
is just a trend that they don't want to see

595
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,080
and a lot of people aren't happy with.

596
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,320
And the massive restructuring they've announced

597
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,920
has people leaving the company.

598
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,120
It has new people in charge of different operations.

599
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,840
Intel is in a vulnerable position right now

600
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,400
because while we won't talk about it a lot,

601
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,480
there's also the AMD platform now

602
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,960
and how competitive that has become.

603
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,560
And we will talk about RISC-V in a little bit,

604
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,440
but there's also that in the background

605
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,640
as well as the open-power PC architecture which

606
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,560
has actually picked up.

607
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,120
So there's a lot of downward pressure

608
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,200
on Intel combined with their own failures.

609
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,840
And of course, this is all in the shadow

610
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,920
of Apple announcing the switch of their entire Mac line

611
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,480
over to ARM CPUs, which early benchmarks would

612
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,980
seem to indicate are actually fairly impressive.

613
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,560
And that's just their early dev kit stuff.

614
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,260
So where does this leave Linux?

615
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,480
And I think to appreciate it, you

616
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,720
have to understand the history of ARM, which

617
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,400
was founded in Cambridge, UK and was sold to SoftBank

618
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,920
many years later, but we'll get to all that in a moment.

619
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:19,800
The early days of ARM are actually kind of quaint.

620
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,580
It started as the official Acorn RISC machine

621
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,880
in October of 1983.

622
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,960
That is a long time ago, especially in computer time.

623
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,240
You think of the x86 platform as the old legacy platform

624
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,560
because it's from the 80s.

625
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,560
But yeah, it started as the Acorn RISC machine in 83.

626
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,440
But the first samples of ARM silicon

627
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,080
that worked properly when received by a customer.

628
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,840
Who wants that?

629
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,920
I know.

630
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,380
April 26, 1985.

631
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,800
And there's a post from 1988 where

632
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,240
some people are talking about getting the machine working.

633
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,560
It's such a trip to go back to 1988

634
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,240
and read what I think was probably an old Usenet post

635
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,080
that has been saved by Google Groups.

636
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,040
The first ARM application was really

637
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,000
like a second tier processor inside a BBC Micro, where

638
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,880
it helped with simulation software

639
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,600
to finish development of other chips

640
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,040
and also sped up CAD designs.

641
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,880
That's a trend you see to this day,

642
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,840
just little helpful ARM CPUs on board.

643
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,880
And an interesting little historical anecdote here

644
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,880
is in the late 80s, Apple and VLSI technology

645
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,560
started working with Acorn on a newer version of what

646
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,000
became the ARM Core.

647
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,680
And in 1990, Acorn spun off that design team

648
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,760
into a company named Advanced RISC Machines Limited,

649
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,840
which became obviously the ARM Holdings parent company

650
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,760
eventually, which then eventually sold to SoftBank.

651
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,900
The new Apple ARM work eventually

652
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,800
evolved into the ARM6 platform, which was released in 1992.

653
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,560
And Apple used the ARM6-based ARM610 CPU

654
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,880
and system on a chip as a basis for the Newton.

655
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,480
Wow.

656
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,640
It's like a weird parallel history here.

657
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,480
Yeah.

658
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,560
The first time around.

659
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,940
If the Newton had been successful,

660
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,280
they may have stuck with it.

661
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,160
But what I think most people probably are aware of,

662
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,000
but maybe don't fully appreciate about ARM,

663
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,840
is it's really a set of specs and licenses

664
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,120
that ARM Holdings and now SoftBank,

665
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,000
and potentially maybe one day Nvidia,

666
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,120
who's looking to buy them now, sell.

667
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,600
And that really became the business for them in 1994,

668
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,400
when they had that proven CPU that worked in the Newton

669
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,320
at 233 megahertz.

670
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,960
They could sell a slightly faster one

671
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,440
to customers as a license.

672
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,080
They do actually sell chips, too.

673
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,720
That actually is something that they do.

674
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,100
But licensing is really what picked up for them

675
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,120
as a business in 1994.

676
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,220
And now you see all these different vendors out there

677
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,640
that have an implementation of ARM.

678
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,480
As far as Linux is concerned, really,

679
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,920
ARM came to the masses via Debian 2.2, which was released

680
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,160
on August 15, 2000.

681
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,680
ARM for Arch, or Arch Linux on ARM,

682
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,000
came out in March 11, 2002.

683
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,600
Wow, that is way earlier than I would have expected.

684
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,880
Yeah, and then you see just a lot of development

685
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,840
across a lot of different Linux distros from there.

686
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,800
That isn't necessarily the first time Linux developers

687
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,680
had their hands on ARM boxes.

688
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,560
I can find interviews with Linux developers going back

689
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,000
to 1994, where they had custom builds of early Linux kernels

690
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,720
that were working on ARM.

691
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,040
But as far as a mainstream distro,

692
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,500
it appears to be Debian 2.2, which is pretty cool.

693
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,520
That is really neat.

694
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,640
It's been a long time now since 2000.

695
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,840
Here we are, and we're still kind of working it out.

696
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,000
20 years later.

697
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,200
We've covered three decades.

698
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,800
Now there's two more since.

699
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,320
Wow.

700
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,500
Yeah, yeah, how about that?

701
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,120
By 2005, 98% of all mobile phones

702
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,480
had at least one type of ARM processor in them, 98%.

703
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,760
By 2010, producers of chips based on ARM architectures

704
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,320
reported shipments of 6.1 billion ARM-based processors,

705
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,280
which is 95% of all smartphones, 35%

706
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:09,480
of all digital televisions, and 10% of all mobile computers.

707
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,540
How about that?

708
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,000
Yeah, and since then, they've kind of gone everywhere, right?

709
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,720
What device sitting around you doesn't have an ARM chip in it?

710
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,880
And of course, one of our favorite little projects,

711
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,400
the Raspberry Pi Model B, was released in February 2012,

712
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,640
followed by a simpler and cheaper Model A later on.

713
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,960
So that's when the Raspberry Pi came to the masses.

714
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,960
And then things kind of took a whole new development track.

715
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,560
At this point, 2020, we've had so many different vendors

716
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,080
of ARM systems that you can't just say ARM

717
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,160
and mean you could just take this image

718
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,220
and run it on anything.

719
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,880
Right, that's been one of the big problems.

720
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,720
But the Pi really did sort of pave the way

721
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,280
for the concept of a super cheap board that students,

722
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,560
enthusiasts, integrators could buy.

723
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,640
Right, it was actually an end-user platform

724
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,520
instead of something that you would take as an integrator

725
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,160
to build into your own product.

726
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,680
Here I am now running it as even a server for home use.

727
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,180
That was it.

728
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,720
It's a general-use platform, or almost.

729
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,260
A lot like Linux.

730
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,600
And it really just took things to the next level.

731
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,720
And Cheesy and I were chatting about this last night

732
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,820
and about just sort of how now we've

733
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,280
sort of set the stage for a whole new generation

734
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,560
of devices that really span the range

735
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,840
of different capabilities.

736
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,440
My only other forte really into Linux and ARM,

737
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,040
aside from the Raspberry Pi, were the WRT-54G routers

738
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,960
back in the day, flashing those with DDWRT, or Tomato,

739
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,120
or Letty, or one of those others.

740
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,760
But one thing that I find really cool,

741
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,480
specifically about the Raspberry Pi

742
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,960
and how it enabled a lot of us Linux users

743
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,600
to get something, an inexpensive board

744
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,720
that we could tinker with, I think what that's doing now

745
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,920
is it's opening doors for a lot of us

746
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,080
to really become more maker-oriented as well.

747
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,840
Because along with the Raspberry Pi,

748
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:02,160
you've got GPIO, DSI now, SPI, I2C.

749
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,520
So you've got a way to really attach

750
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,160
a bunch of different elements onto this machine

751
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,800
and really do something, I think,

752
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:14,160
that we haven't been able to do with Linux

753
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,260
and our general desktops for quite a while.

754
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,640
There's just a ton of boards out there now, right?

755
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,140
So I mean, since the Raspberry Pi,

756
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,000
you've had everybody kind of come on board.

757
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,600
Obviously, one of my favorites is Pine64.

758
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,600
They tend to be mainly RockChip.

759
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,600
They were founded by TL Lim, the same guy

760
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,800
that did the Popcorn Hour series of media players,

761
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,720
which back in the day, again, like Chris had mentioned,

762
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,600
a lot of your set-top boxes and stuff like that

763
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,280
have ARM chips in them, and still to this day, they do.

764
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,800
BeagleBone, I think, needs a mention.

765
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,160
The Asus Tinker Board, the Onion Omega 2,

766
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,760
the Libre Computer, I mean, there's just tons.

767
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,420
Like, the market has really exploded.

768
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,040
So there's no reason that you can't get

769
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,720
into one of these ARM boards and work on it,

770
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,240
develop for it, tinker with it.

771
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,080
And I suspect that now we're going to, we already have,

772
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,560
but even more so, we're going to venture into ARM CPUs

773
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:18,560
in data centers, like AWS's new Graviton.

774
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,660
I think you're gonna see more complete products, too.

775
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,640
Like, look at the PineBook Pro.

776
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,480
That is sort of bringing together so much stuff

777
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,520
that we have been seeing develop over the last 20, 30 years.

778
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,120
And it's a genuine product that by version two or three,

779
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,080
I'm gonna be recommending to just about everybody I know.

780
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,920
It's great because I think, in a way,

781
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,020
it showed me that this really,

782
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,580
there really is something to it.

783
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,280
I don't know if it's for all tasks,

784
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,760
but there really is something to Linux on ARM.

785
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,400
And I know you've had a chance to kind of like,

786
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,760
actually open the thing up and take a look at it

787
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,880
from more of like, modifying the hardware standpoint.

788
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,040
Did it hold up to that process?

789
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,320
I purchased the original PineBook

790
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,840
that had the ISO keyboard.

791
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,000
So I switched it over to ANC.

792
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,240
I bought the top case, which was super inexpensive.

793
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,940
I think it was like 15 bucks or something.

794
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,800
But doing so meant that essentially,

795
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,560
you had to disassemble the entire laptop

796
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,640
aside from the screen.

797
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,980
Oh, go figure.

798
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,360
So once I disassembled the laptop,

799
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,160
you know, it was super easy getting into it.

800
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:25,160
I would say maybe 25 screws, maybe 25 screws completely.

801
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,240
And as you open it up, I mean, really the largest portion

802
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,280
of the inside of that laptop is the battery,

803
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,060
like a lot of laptops these days.

804
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:39,500
But the motherboard, for lack of better terms,

805
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,600
is a quarter or a third the size.

806
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,640
Is there room for more battery in there, do you think?

807
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,760
I would say no.

808
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,520
I would say there's no room for an extra battery.

809
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,100
I did add the NVMe adapter.

810
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,040
I haven't popped in an NVMe drive yet,

811
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,640
because I still think there's some issues

812
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,520
with U-Boot and booting directly to the NVMe drive.

813
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,800
You could leave the eMMC in there to boot off of, right?

814
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,680
Right, and so that's the idea, right,

815
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,400
is you could boot off of that and then throw it to the NVMe.

816
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,600
And that's totally worth it, dude.

817
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,640
That would haul, that'd be awesome.

818
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,280
Yeah, I mean, I think that's when you would start

819
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,840
to see the limitations of the hardware itself, right,

820
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,480
as compared to the current eMMC that it uses.

821
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,620
Yeah.

822
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,200
Why don't we talk about the future a little bit?

823
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,880
Stay awhile and listen.

824
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,200
And Dalton from the Ubiports Project

825
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,200
is joining us to chat a little bit about,

826
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,520
I wanted to really kind of get a handle, Dalton,

827
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,140
on what some of the challenges are for the ARM platform,

828
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,120
kind of going forward,

829
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,640
what some of the significant barriers still are.

830
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,980
I alluded to like all of the different hardware versions

831
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,560
and whatnot, but I know you've kind of probably

832
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,060
gotten a pretty close look at this

833
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,520
being part of the Ubiports Project.

834
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,900
I would imagine a bit.

835
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,320
Yeah, for sure.

836
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,040
So one of the things about ARM

837
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,920
and what makes it complicated to develop on

838
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,520
is that ARM products are designed to be this vertically

839
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,080
integrated full stack thing.

840
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,920
You know, most phones that are out today,

841
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,840
you have Samsung who buys their chips from Qualcomm.

842
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,880
Qualcomm gives them this blessed version of Linux

843
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,800
that works on that Qualcomm chip,

844
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,760
and then Samsung takes it and makes their product out of it.

845
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,840
And it's not like the mainline Linux,

846
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,320
and it's not like any Linux distribution,

847
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,880
it's Samsung's, well in most cases, Android

848
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,320
that's going to run on that hardware device eventually.

849
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,560
And that makes things more difficult

850
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,240
when we are a third-party software vendor.

851
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,080
Sure.

852
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,040
What we expect and what a lot of our users expect

853
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,160
is the horizontal platform that x86 has become,

854
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,040
where you take Ubuntu, period,

855
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,240
and you boot that on whatever computer you want to.

856
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,440
You can boot it on my Dell XPS,

857
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,800
my Ryzen 7 workstation downstairs,

858
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,640
all the way back to some Core 2 Duo machine from 2008.

859
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,680
Where we're going now is people are seeing,

860
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,120
especially server vendors,

861
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,440
don't want to be that vertical integrator.

862
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,880
Dell doesn't want to make, well, maybe they do,

863
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,440
but Dell probably doesn't want to make Dell Linux

864
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,600
for the Dell EMC server platform, right?

865
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,800
Right, and they're selling to customers

866
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,160
who sort of expect this plug and play, just,

867
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,600
they're going to put on their own operating system

868
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,040
and configure it afterwards.

869
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,800
They're going to want to put Ubuntu on the server

870
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,480
for lack of a better option.

871
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,000
And I think that's kind of where we come

872
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,120
into ARM Server Ready,

873
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,800
which is a set of technologies,

874
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,400
a specification and a certification by ARM Holdings.

875
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,360
So this is really cool.

876
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,520
I didn't know about this Dalton

877
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,680
until you educated me on it.

878
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,840
And as luck would have it on July 20th of this year,

879
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,560
a VMware developer who works in the bootloader area

880
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,240
for the ARM platform held a video stream

881
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,640
about Server Ready.

882
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,960
We'll have a link to that in the show notes,

883
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,120
but you guys know me.

884
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,840
I grabbed you a couple of essential clips

885
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,720
and here's his definition of Server Ready.

886
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,560
Server Ready is about making boring infrastructure.

887
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,600
Boring in a sense where I can buy an HPE

888
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,560
or Dell server today,

889
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,320
and I don't have to ask myself

890
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,080
whether it will run an operating system

891
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,040
that can also run on my laptop.

892
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,200
So that's kind of the definition of boring.

893
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,880
Boring means that I don't have to retrain my IT staff.

894
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,640
Boring means that you don't need any new skill sets

895
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:30,640
in OEMs or ODMs to design platform solutions around chips.

896
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,960
Boring means that software developers

897
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,240
can continue doing what it is they do best,

898
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,480
and they don't have to completely

899
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,800
kind of change the worldview.

900
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,320
So Server Ready seems like it could have some potential

901
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,440
if it's implemented correctly.

902
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Neil, I wanted to give you a chance to jump in

903
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,760
on that particular topic,

904
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,960
because I know you have thoughts.

905
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,720
This isn't worth the paper it was printed on.

906
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,440
Server Ready certification boils down into two parts.

907
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,240
The first part is implementing a ARM-based system

908
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,200
that follows the Server-based system architecture, or SBSA.

909
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,080
And this essentially mandates that it should behave

910
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,680
somewhat similarly to how modern x86 machines do

911
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,880
with UEFI exposing an ACPI-like interface,

912
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,520
all these sorts of things like that,

913
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,080
like PCIe support is actually like specified in there.

914
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,200
That is fine and dandy.

915
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,880
You're not really going to see

916
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,160
anything that's in an approachable price range

917
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,880
supporting SBSA.

918
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,560
So where you're typically gonna see this is

919
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,560
in rack mount servers and stuff like that.

920
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,680
So the developer from VMware,

921
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,560
he addresses, because he agrees,

922
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,000
the issue right now is that it's for very high cost systems,

923
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,520
server grade systems,

924
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,000
but he makes the case, and I'll play his clip,

925
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,320
that for the developers that are gonna be

926
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,040
writing applications for these future high-end ARM servers,

927
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,440
they need something within their comfort level

928
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,320
to develop on.

929
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,720
But I'll play it and then, Neil, I'll let you respond.

930
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,360
There are folks in the audience who don't care about IoT,

931
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,200
don't care about small board computers,

932
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,720
and might actually not really like the Raspberry Pi.

933
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,720
Why would any of you care?

934
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,520
Well, because there are no good client platforms today

935
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,280
to build a good mass of developers.

936
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,240
If I want folks to build from my Xeon E7,

937
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,240
they can do it on a $200 laptop.

938
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,280
If I want something to build for a Thunder X3,

939
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,480
whenever that comes out,

940
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,480
what am I gonna use?

941
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,560
And I think some of the pressure here will be that

942
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,040
cloud providers will offer a discounted rate,

943
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,720
well, like Amazon already does,

944
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,480
if you run on their ARM system.

945
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,600
The problem with this is, quite frankly,

946
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,040
you're not gonna see anything

947
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,160
that isn't vertically integrated for this space either.

948
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,400
So let's talk about, for example, Apple,

949
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,800
which is the silver elephant in the room.

950
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,640
They will follow SBSA

951
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,160
because that is how they're going to design it.

952
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,400
However, it doesn't matter.

953
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,160
You are not gonna be able to take advantage of it.

954
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,440
They do SBSA not because it makes things easier for you

955
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,160
as a developer or consumer,

956
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,880
but it makes it easier for them

957
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,880
to transition the macOS platform from X86 to ARM

958
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,320
without having to retool the plumbing layers

959
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,720
because the plumbing layers will behave the same.

960
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,040
For some context, Jeremy from System76 is here,

961
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,240
and I also emailed Carl, the CEO of System76,

962
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,480
and I said, just your personal thoughts,

963
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,760
not like a company position, but your personal thoughts

964
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,320
on ARM because Carl thinks a lot about this stuff.

965
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,320
And by the way, great brunch with Brent.

966
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,280
So go check out brunch with Brent.

967
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,680
That's well worth listening.

968
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,560
Carl got me thinking about how I view choice in Linux

969
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,360
and how it's the true competitive strength.

970
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,200
It's a good chat.

971
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,640
But I asked him about ARM,

972
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,680
and he said that he doesn't really find it very exciting.

973
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,880
He said device-specific OS images are pain,

974
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,680
hard, and limit hackability,

975
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,360
especially without good documentation.

976
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,440
The architecture he thinks makes sense

977
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,960
for a lock-in device maker like Apple.

978
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,880
I like that term, lock-in device maker.

979
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,640
Remember that one for me, okay, Wes?

980
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,640
I know it's sourcing my memory to you on that.

981
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,040
He says, so for like a company like Apple

982
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,720
or perhaps an entry-level performance machine,

983
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,160
but System76 cares about performance hackability

984
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,920
and users easily running whatever they want.

985
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,440
So that's kind of how I think about it.

986
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,920
Now, of course, that's a great position for him to take,

987
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,360
but that's, as an end user, how I think about it.

988
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,200
I mean, it's your device.

989
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,040
You want to do stuff with it.

990
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,880
That's it.

991
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,440
He says, I am excited to see where RISC-V goes, though.

992
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,520
We'll talk about that in a moment,

993
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,840
but Jeremy, I saw you tweeting recently

994
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,120
about moving some fancy stuff over to ARM machines possibly,

995
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,320
and I'm just curious about your thoughts on this.

996
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,080
Yeah, so I agree with Carl,

997
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,800
and I think what Neil has said is completely correct.

998
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,840
What we want to see as Linux users and Linux developers,

999
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,200
we really want to see the high-performance chips

1000
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,960
run mainline Linux.

1001
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,360
We want to see something like the Huawei trips

1002
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,200
or the Qualcomm chips that are being used

1003
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,200
in top-of-the-line mobile phones

1004
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,640
that are able to do 4K video from YouTube,

1005
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,680
which the Pinebook Pro can't right now,

1006
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,920
and we're simply not seeing that.

1007
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,640
Apple and what they're going to have,

1008
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,480
that is not going to run desktop Linux.

1009
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,720
So for us who are outside of the server space

1010
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,200
and the developers who really want to have a platform

1011
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,400
like you get from an x86 laptop,

1012
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,800
there was some hope.

1013
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,920
There was some hope when Windows was pushing Windows on ARM

1014
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,400
because things would have been more like PC

1015
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,840
on those ARM platforms.

1016
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,520
Now, unfortunately, they had mandatory secure boot,

1017
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,120
but that's something that can be worked around.

1018
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,360
Microsoft does sign other distributions,

1019
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,640
but I think we're kind of doomed

1020
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,280
with the way ARM is right now

1021
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,280
because ARM Holdings prefers

1022
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,360
that they have value add being done

1023
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,680
by every single SOC vendor.

1024
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,880
So they will produce the minimal,

1025
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,520
absolute minimal instruction set,

1026
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,640
and then the SOC vendor will add a whole bunch

1027
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,600
of memory addresses and memory map devices

1028
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,120
to do things like acceleration.

1029
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,680
And those accelerations are, in many cases,

1030
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,600
important to running a desktop operating system.

1031
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,400
So having support for that means,

1032
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,520
often you have to run a specific kernel

1033
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,440
for that specific device,

1034
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,880
which is what we see in the Android space.

1035
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,880
So my hope is that RISC-V doesn't run down the same path.

1036
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,760
And I'm really hoping that there is a general purpose,

1037
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,800
very well-defined thing,

1038
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,440
such as what we have in the x86 world,

1039
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,440
which is we have ACPI, we have UEFI, we have PCI,

1040
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,640
and these standards allow you to do hardware discovery

1041
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,400
in a very generic way.

1042
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,720
Yeah, that really speaks true to me.

1043
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,240
The fundamental just nature of the way

1044
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,120
these CPUs are designed and the value add

1045
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,920
that's created by the parties involved,

1046
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,760
it fundamentally means they're always gonna have

1047
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,160
unique properties.

1048
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,640
So I kind of look at this, though,

1049
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,720
acknowledging all of that in a perspective of

1050
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,800
things do change, and imagine a world, Dalton,

1051
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,120
where Nvidia buys the ARM holdings from SoftBank,

1052
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,000
which is the current rumor that's being reported on,

1053
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,480
and structures change a little bit.

1054
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,360
Apple releases extremely successful ARM-based MacBooks,

1055
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,760
at least from a performance standpoint,

1056
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,600
and Windows OEMs, like they have historically now

1057
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,600
for 30 years, follow suit and release high-end HP

1058
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:54,600
and Dell laptops that are based on ARM running Windows.

1059
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,160
In this scenario, with Server Ready,

1060
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,480
you could see just that market pressure

1061
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,040
creating more adoption, combined with the fact

1062
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,300
that it's kind of close on the Raspberry Pi 4 right now.

1063
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,340
What are your thoughts?

1064
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,920
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.

1065
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,380
And as the talk that you'll link to kind of goes into,

1066
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,400
there have been Qualcomm ARM laptops

1067
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,400
and mobile processors, or mobile devices,

1068
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,240
that use a variation of ACPI or something similar to it.

1069
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,360
But at the moment, they only run custom

1070
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,440
Windows on Snapdragon images.

1071
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,440
But I see that going in the direction that we want,

1072
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,440
where devices that ship with Windows on ARM

1073
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,080
can boot enough, just out of the box,

1074
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,600
to say, I have all of this hardware,

1075
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,880
Linux, please look for your drivers

1076
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,360
for all of this hardware.

1077
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,720
I mean, we want the ARM vendors to be putting

1078
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,280
all those drivers in the kernel too,

1079
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,640
but it'd also just be nice if we could know

1080
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,320
that we need those drivers to be available

1081
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,720
in order to use the hardware

1082
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,840
that we're currently booting Linux on.

1083
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,920
No kidding.

1084
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,440
So I see a future where these fundamental problems

1085
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,800
that Neil and Jeremy have touched on are not solved,

1086
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,600
because it's sort of now, 30 years in,

1087
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,960
it's what the platform is.

1088
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,360
Right, and someone has to pay for it.

1089
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,360
Yeah, exactly.

1090
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,200
As Neil said.

1091
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,960
And I think, ultimately, you could see a moderation of it

1092
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,520
if there is enough competitive pressure brought by RISC

1093
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,060
or PowerPC, you know, I mean, a man can dream.

1094
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,480
But I don't think it's ever gonna be fully solved

1095
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,440
in the ARM ecosystem, which is why I kind of fall down

1096
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,520
with Jeremy and Carl and Neil and sort of saying,

1097
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,860
we really kind of need a different solution.

1098
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,480
But what I like about what Dalton is touching on here

1099
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,040
is that doesn't mean the ARM ecosystem goes away.

1100
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,120
That's never gonna happen now at this point.

1101
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,560
And so if there is something we can do

1102
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,000
to apply some kind of pressure,

1103
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,560
some sort of at least standards that we can expect,

1104
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,360
it would make life so much easier

1105
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,680
for Linux on the ARM platform and for Windows

1106
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,200
and for server vendors and for developers.

1107
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,680
I'm just tired of downloading the wrong ARM build

1108
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,720
or something.

1109
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,360
Yeah, I think that's really kind of,

1110
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,560
really kind of has gotten all of us a little bitter about it

1111
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,120
is like, let's just solve this now.

1112
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,800
And, you know, like I would love to be able to just,

1113
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,360
when the Raspberry Pi 5 comes out,

1114
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,680
I'd love to be able to just assume

1115
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,240
I can put the current build of CentOS on it.

1116
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,680
Like I don't have to wait for somebody in the community

1117
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,680
to create some special fancy boot system.

1118
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,760
It'll just work.

1119
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,600
Same with Ubuntu and Fedora.

1120
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,480
And I mentioned CentOS because that's really

1121
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,200
what I tried last go around.

1122
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,400
And we're just not there,

1123
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,040
but maybe in a future we could.

1124
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,000
I'll play the last clip from that presentation

1125
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,480
that touches on this,

1126
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,840
and then we'll link for the rest in the show notes.

1127
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,000
Far as OS support for those, you know,

1128
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
for example, in Linux, it's non-existent.

1129
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,280
Nobody has done that work.

1130
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,840
Within NetBSD and OpenBSD today are probably

1131
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,280
the best operating systems in terms of support

1132
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,000
for the platform using ACPI bindings.

1133
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,520
So some of the biggest challenges

1134
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,480
is in the way how USB is wired up.

1135
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,880
Due to the Silicon bug,

1136
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,320
the PCI Express root complex can only address three gigabytes.

1137
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,120
Well, the Raspberry Pi comes in a four gigabyte flavor.

1138
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,240
Because of that, there needs to be a way

1139
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,120
by which the firmware can communicate

1140
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,960
to the operating system that it shouldn't use

1141
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,240
the full four gigabytes for DMA.

1142
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,000
In other words, it's still a ways off

1143
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,120
before it's gonna be there

1144
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,320
is really what's the reality of it.

1145
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,040
It's a fascinating talk to watch though.

1146
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,320
I mean, just some of the technology

1147
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,760
and the clever things going on

1148
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,560
to make this work as much as it is so far.

1149
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,640
And I think maybe ultimately,

1150
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,920
the other thing that's really nice about it

1151
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,440
is just to see people addressing this

1152
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,040
and starting this conversation.

1153
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
It really will kind of,

1154
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,560
we'll kind of see the results will be driven by

1155
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:09,040
what the predominant uses for Linux on ARM end up being,

1156
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,440
which is probably gonna be data center and IoT.

1157
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,960
Something tells me if I were just to guess.

1158
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,960
Thank you, guys.

1159
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,880
It doesn't seem like the silver bolt we were hoping,

1160
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,840
but you could see a Raspberry Pi four or five one day

1161
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,680
getting support for it

1162
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,840
because it's just small things,

1163
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,240
just small things now at this point,

1164
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,360
but small things that persist.

1165
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,240
Hey, Wes Payne.

1166
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,840
What do you say we do an app picker too

1167
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,680
before we get out of here?

1168
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,240
Oh, an app picker you say?

1169
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,320
I do say, Wes.

1170
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,240
I do say.

1171
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,880
I do say it, Wes.

1172
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,720
I do.

1173
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,840
I want to talk about TU uptime,

1174
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,360
T uptime, top time.

1175
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,440
I like top time.

1176
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,320
No, it's gotta be T uptime, right?

1177
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,160
It's gotta be.

1178
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,000
I think cheese decides he found.

1179
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,240
It doesn't matter, Wes.

1180
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,200
Who cares?

1181
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,600
It's a cool utility.

1182
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,800
I'm going with top time.

1183
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,880
Top time?

1184
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,120
You guys are crazy.

1185
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:58,960
Just sounds good.

1186
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,800
Top time.

1187
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,640
It just don't matter.

1188
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,800
It don't matter.

1189
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,680
It's a tool to report the historical

1190
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,480
and statistical real time of your system

1191
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,080
between restarts.

1192
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,720
Yeah, you know, we're all familiar with uptime.

1193
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,360
You just find out how long the system's been online,

1194
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,920
but what if you're interested in a longer term behavior?

1195
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,920
How long was it online?

1196
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,920
When was it last restarted?

1197
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,560
And history about previous runs.

1198
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,880
And what was the load during that time?

1199
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,240
It looks like as well, which is great.

1200
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,600
Want that.

1201
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,320
Reminds me of a classic command

1202
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,880
that doesn't give you nearly as much information,

1203
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:29,080
but this is great because you get all the load info too.

1204
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,040
And it's a super easy command

1205
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,080
because once you get it installed,

1206
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,680
it's just T uptime, which has got to be,

1207
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,280
I can't believe I'm the one advocating for that.

1208
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,120
You guys are trolling me right now, aren't you?

1209
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:39,960
That's what's happening.

1210
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,000
You all know how to say it.

1211
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,080
Well, don't worry, Chris.

1212
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,000
Top time is available in the AUR.

1213
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,840
Top time.

1214
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,640
Even with you right now.

1215
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,360
And then we have one more bonus pick,

1216
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,800
which I think we've mentioned before,

1217
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,960
but recently came handy.

1218
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,560
So I want to mention it again is SETUI.

1219
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:02,440
S-T-U-I, which is a terminal based CPU stress

1220
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,240
and monitoring utility,

1221
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,440
or as Wes Payne calls it, SETUI.

1222
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,120
Well, now you're just putting words in my mouth.

1223
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,560
I'm pretty sure I've heard you call it that though.

1224
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,360
I thought that one was SETUI.

1225
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,600
Yeah, that's how I would do it, I think.

1226
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,840
No, I'm pretty sure you said SETUI, so.

1227
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,680
Stewie?

1228
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,360
Stop time and SETUI.

1229
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,600
All right, well that brings us

1230
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,040
to the end of this week's broadcast.

1231
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,120
Thank you so much for tuning in.

He's at Wes Payne, I'm at Chris Ellis.

1239
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,640
The show is at Linux Unplugged.

1240
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,560
And that's probably all I have to relay to you.

1241
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,640
When are we going to be back here?

1242
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,720
Oh, you want me to say when we're going to be back?

1243
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,560
You want me to say it?

1244
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,400
All right, we'll see you right back here next Tuesday!

1245
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:28,200
We love you quads!

1246
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:39,920
Dalton, we didn't get a chance to talk about it in the main show, but I'm just curious

1247
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,120
if you have any project updates while you're here.

1248
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,160
Oh, well, everything's going pretty decently on the PinePhone.

1249
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:52,160
We got all the, fingers crossed, all of the PinePhone UbiPorts Edition devices have shipped

1250
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,720
out and are arriving in people's houses now.

1251
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,340
Hey, hey, congratulations.

1252
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,640
That's a big moment.

1253
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,600
That's a bit of a wait off.

1254
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,760
Big thanks to Pine64 for that.

1255
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,920
On the device, there's still some of the basics to get going and it's been pretty exciting

1256
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:16,240
and it's made me learn a lot about what most integrators do on the ARM platform and really

1257
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,320
let me bring the perspective that I had today.

1258
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:25,080
Because before this, I only knew the Android perspective of the world, which simplifies

1259
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,620
a lot of that out for you.

1260
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,840
That's an interesting insight and I can totally see that.

1261
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,400
That's a pretty solved problem at this point on the Android side.

1262
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,400
To a point, yeah.

1263
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,400
Oh yeah?

1264
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,400
Only to a point, huh?

1265
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,400
Yeah, okay.

1266
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:57,920
Why am I not surprised?
