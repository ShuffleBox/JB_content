WEBVTT

00:00.880 --> 00:06.160
This is great that the WikiLeaks just sent out that one the this one tweet from the OSB projects

00:06.160 --> 00:12.800
Oh, yeah, OSB projects y'all. This is from the CIA's own documents. You know we got all the dankest Trojans

00:13.200 --> 00:19.180
No, I didn't see that. That's amazing. Oh there it is. Yeah, I've ever read the dankest Trojans Wow

00:20.340 --> 00:22.340
You know we got all the dankest Trojans

00:22.340 --> 00:24.340
Oh

00:27.020 --> 00:32.100
My god, I'm gonna work for the CIA now. Yeah, well, maybe maybe that's why they got some good hackers

00:32.100 --> 00:37.340
They're actually fun on the inside. I mean sure on the outside. They're all about killing and droning but on the inside

00:37.340 --> 00:39.340
They got the dankest Trojans

00:39.340 --> 00:49.820
You got the dankest Trojans. This is Linux Unplugged episode 187 for March 7th, 2017

01:00.820 --> 01:07.540
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's very well traveled this week with stories from all about my name is Chris

01:07.540 --> 01:13.060
My name is Wes. Hello there Wes. You look very dapper today, sir. Thank you. It is a big show

01:13.060 --> 01:14.460
Oh, yeah, so much stuff

01:14.460 --> 01:20.780
We of course as has been tradition for now three weeks in a row are gonna start with some wolf blitzer style breaking news

01:20.780 --> 01:24.300
We're gonna get all blitzer up in here cover some big news and how it applies to Linux

01:24.780 --> 01:31.940
Everybody's talking about it this week. Then. Mr. Brian Lunduke will stop by the show. He's actually secret spoiler already here

01:31.940 --> 01:34.980
I'm gonna talk a little bit about the last the final

01:35.580 --> 01:37.420
Linux sucks

01:37.420 --> 01:42.380
It's an end of an era. We'll get the inside scoop on what's going on. I suspect

01:42.980 --> 01:48.460
It's all about his hairdo now later on in the show. We're gonna hear from mr. Wimpy and mr

01:48.460 --> 01:53.700
Popey about their trip to mobile world Congress and then if that's not enough if that's not enough like, you know

01:53.700 --> 01:59.020
We got a little scale in there a little mobile world Congress. We're gonna get you amped up about odd camp 17 what?

01:59.940 --> 02:01.820
Then we're gonna work back to scale

02:01.820 --> 02:04.940
We're gonna go to the gnome booth and talk to the gnome guys about some of the stuff

02:04.940 --> 02:11.060
They've been working on why they like endless OS the new endless OS PC. I think it's called the mission

02:11.060 --> 02:14.420
Yeah, so Noah got to see it. He got to talk to the guys at the booth

02:14.420 --> 02:18.900
We're gonna play an interview from that and then at the end of the show

02:19.740 --> 02:26.040
New piece of hardware touting elementary OS by default. However, the elementary OS project

02:26.460 --> 02:31.100
Super silent on the issue kind of like they don't want any attention on it and the hardware

02:31.100 --> 02:35.780
It looks like it might be a bit of a scam not sure exactly what's going on

02:36.300 --> 02:39.160
But producer Michaels been following the story from the very beginning

02:39.780 --> 02:47.360
Asking questions getting the inside scoop. So we'll dig into that and talk about the light or I'm sorry the little light

02:47.360 --> 02:52.300
I think it's called the light book which is a $250 Linux laptop. Is it too good to be true a

02:52.940 --> 02:58.500
$250 Linux laptop preloaded with elementary OS but before we can get into any of that

02:58.500 --> 03:02.760
We must say hello to our virtual log time appropriate greetings mumble room

03:07.820 --> 03:14.540
So everyone it is a big news day today and it's if you've been following any of the news have any of news outlets

03:14.540 --> 03:19.380
I mean, they're all just I'm sure just talking about in great detail. Well, maybe a little bit of detail

03:19.740 --> 03:23.860
Maybe maybe not as much detail. Yeah, so it's up to us then it's up to us

03:23.860 --> 03:26.420
It is it is our duty to go wolf blitzer on this

03:26.420 --> 03:28.720
We're gonna do a little breaking news right here on the show

03:30.940 --> 03:35.500
So this morning a little earlier than expected Richard Stallman was once again proven, correct

03:36.180 --> 03:42.780
In fact, this isn't even I don't have to point this out WikiLeaks tweeted this DNU founder Richard Stallman its famous quote

03:43.380 --> 03:45.640
resonates today at WikiLeaks publication

03:46.460 --> 03:47.540
with software

03:47.540 --> 03:55.100
There are only two possibilities either the users control the program or the program controls the users if the program controls the users

03:55.100 --> 04:00.540
And the developer controls the program then the program is an instrument of unjust power

04:01.200 --> 04:05.580
Now I this is this is sort of a pungent. Is that the right word a pungent smells a little bad

04:06.060 --> 04:08.180
It's really no you never like to hear this because you know

04:08.420 --> 04:13.020
Everybody has well except for I I want to be able to play games or well except for I want to be able to record

04:13.020 --> 04:17.060
Video and ProRes or except I want to be able to make phone calls on my iPhone

04:17.540 --> 04:23.800
Everybody has these these little accepts where they don't want to give on this particular quote and then something happens

04:23.800 --> 04:27.900
It seems like every cup every couple of months and this quote comes back up

04:27.900 --> 04:31.740
And it's more right and more true and more correct than ever and it just stings

04:31.860 --> 04:36.080
It just tastes bad a little bit cuz like damn it. Damn it. He's right

04:36.140 --> 04:41.380
He might eat toe jam, but he is right today WikiLeaks revealed vault 7 a

04:42.100 --> 04:47.620
Whole batch of CIA crap. Yeah, like almost 8,000. Yeah. Yeah over 8,000 over

04:47.900 --> 04:49.900
8,000 documents Wes and

04:49.900 --> 04:53.520
And it has it has been dubbed the year of zero

04:53.980 --> 04:59.160
Yeah, you're zero which is I probably in reference to all of the zero-day exploits that are contained in this

04:59.220 --> 05:04.860
So there is actually something in here. That's a little applicable to Linux. I'm gonna save the most you know most of this for

05:05.740 --> 05:09.100
Unfilter or tech snapper wherever wherever it may lie as we go through it

05:09.260 --> 05:15.860
but one thing I thought was interesting and it just came out today is the CIA has malware that

05:15.860 --> 05:19.840
It's pretty sweet because it can target Windows OS 10

05:20.660 --> 05:22.720
Linux or some hardware routers

05:23.380 --> 05:26.700
It's called hive and it's a multi-platform

05:27.700 --> 05:33.300
Automated malware attack and control system. Oh also Solaire's shouldn't I shouldn't forget Solaire's and

05:34.260 --> 05:36.940
It it's also related to the cutthroat and swindle tools

05:38.980 --> 05:43.980
Wow first of all I love the names cutthroat swindle hive totally love the name

05:43.980 --> 05:48.460
I think all of this is great, and it goes into more detail in fact

05:49.300 --> 05:51.620
They have and I have these linked in the show notes

05:52.300 --> 05:54.300
Guides on how to use this

05:54.300 --> 06:00.020
Developer guides end-user guy nice documentation really good information about how I see MP

06:00.300 --> 06:06.180
Pings and air ICMP errors work, and which ISPs might reject them quite fascinating actually they've done some good work here

06:06.660 --> 06:12.120
It's it's remarkable to read through this and go okay, so everything you kind of suspected is

06:12.120 --> 06:16.600
Probably true that conspiracy that you thought was totally out there and crazy now

06:16.600 --> 06:19.160
It looks like it's more and more true every day there was software there

06:19.160 --> 06:24.080
They have supposedly tools in here that help them target computer systems in cars. Oh, yeah, totally

06:24.560 --> 06:26.560
That's something a lot of people have suspected before

06:27.200 --> 06:34.260
Mr.. Lundic you and I were talking about this before the show anything about anything in the vault 7 leaks Brian jump out at you

06:34.260 --> 06:36.200
is either preposterous or

06:36.200 --> 06:39.280
Fascinating in the context of Linux or just worth noting

06:39.280 --> 06:45.720
There's only really one thing that's worth noting in all of this and that is that the CIA has the dankest Trojan yes

06:45.720 --> 06:47.320
Yeah, I

06:47.320 --> 06:50.940
Love that that is that is true, and you can't deny it now

06:50.940 --> 06:55.680
I mean if they didn't they would they be doing their job they make the NSA look like a bunch of middle schoolers

06:55.800 --> 06:59.520
Right they do come on CIA is like we want our own exploits

06:59.520 --> 07:02.080
We're not going through those guys giving them our operational deets

07:02.080 --> 07:05.960
This is how the CIA talks because they're soups hip they're soups hip so they go out there

07:05.960 --> 07:09.880
Go what a totes get our own zero days, and they're gonna be the dankest zero days

07:09.920 --> 07:13.800
They're kind of talking like Trump a little bit. It's a little Trump Ian in the way. There's down

07:15.320 --> 07:17.840
This is all all new relevant stuff to

07:18.760 --> 07:20.160
from

07:20.160 --> 07:21.600
2013 to

07:21.600 --> 07:25.280
2016 is wait a minute wait a minute Chris Christopher Fisher

07:25.280 --> 07:27.880
I got to call you out for a second here go for it now

07:28.000 --> 07:30.120
I'm not the biggest Trump fan in the world

07:30.120 --> 07:35.440
But I don't believe I've ever heard Donald Trump get up on stage and say damn that is dank all

07:35.440 --> 07:41.600
I would like that, but I don't believe he's done that so I'm gonna call Shanann can we wait and hope I mean

07:41.640 --> 07:46.980
Maybe it's only just started. We totally it's the first hundred days man. It's the first hundred days, so you never know

07:50.440 --> 07:56.480
That's the new distraction so yeah 2013 to 2016 is where this documents are from

07:57.640 --> 07:59.360
It sounds like they got it

07:59.360 --> 08:05.320
essentially because people were passing this stuff loosey-goosey around the government at this point and so people inside the government got it over to

08:05.320 --> 08:06.280
WikiLeaks

08:06.280 --> 08:12.200
They've been sitting on it for a little bit. There was some discussion in the last few weeks. I think it was even just

08:13.280 --> 08:16.760
Last week Julian Assange, so they would get it really sometime this year

08:16.920 --> 08:24.100
But they were going through it they were redacting not just names and some dates now, but they're also redacting portions of code

08:24.760 --> 08:26.760
Which is an interesting thing they have to do

08:28.000 --> 08:33.320
Avoid easily weaponizing the information at least this is part one of this was obtained recently in covers through

08:33.320 --> 08:38.080
2016 details on the other parts will be available later on and then in there

08:38.160 --> 08:42.080
This is amazing, so they're not just creating malware for Linux

08:42.280 --> 08:49.360
But they're also using Linux to hack Macs and they have a guide on how you can use Ubuntu or mint

08:49.360 --> 08:50.760
Whichever you prefer

08:50.760 --> 08:56.320
Users choice CIA hackers choice you meant or Ubuntu, but at least let's be honest at least

08:56.320 --> 09:01.800
It's gonna something that supports snap packages like a gentleman and they say in here. You can configure

09:01.800 --> 09:06.560
If the Linux or Ubuntu mint install to hack the UEFI

09:07.760 --> 09:09.560
firmware on a Mac

09:09.560 --> 09:14.440
That's actually pretty neat. Yeah, and they have they have apparently they have their own internal repos

09:14.440 --> 09:18.560
And they even look they even have instructions on using hit this covers using GCC

09:18.560 --> 09:22.880
This is this is the CIA's documentation on using GCC to build hacking tools on Linux

09:23.760 --> 09:28.320
Or the UEFI driver wizard. Yeah, yeah, this is this is what it is here

09:28.320 --> 09:33.760
Huh, it's a long page like this is pretty legit documentation

09:33.960 --> 09:38.480
That's really kind of a mess look at this. They even have a little gooey like a look at that

09:38.480 --> 09:41.920
It's with the with the screenshots with the default Ubuntu theme there

09:43.560 --> 09:46.000
Ubuntu is everywhere now. Oh yeah, yeah, it's really popular

09:48.520 --> 09:52.040
Well when you're hacking at home when you're hacking at the office you want to be on the same platform

09:52.040 --> 09:57.120
Yeah, that's true right it makes it much easier when you're building in and also they talk about using

09:57.120 --> 10:03.840
Public VPS's for the command and control servers to make it even more confusing they talk about tools that intentionally leave quote-unquote

10:04.040 --> 10:06.360
Fingerprints that look Russian or whatever else they want

10:06.760 --> 10:09.120
This is really it's a really big treasure trove of stuff

10:09.120 --> 10:13.280
But the one thing that I thought was interesting was this hive thing just in context of this show

10:13.840 --> 10:21.440
It's a multi-platform malware suite and control software the project provides customizable implants for Windows Solaris micro tech routers and

10:21.440 --> 10:27.960
And Linux platforms. Yeah, yeah, it also has a listening post which is what they call the command and control infrastructure to communicate with these

10:28.400 --> 10:33.520
Implants is what they call the the Trojan is an implant the implants are configured to communicate via HTTPS

10:34.360 --> 10:40.160
With a web server on the domain that they've chosen which is usually like a cover domain of some kind and each operating

10:40.440 --> 10:46.720
Each each operation utilizing these implants has separate cover domains and infrastructure can handle any number of cover domains

10:46.720 --> 10:52.200
So you can have one server for the command and control but appear to be hundreds of domains on one VPS

10:52.200 --> 10:56.240
If you want it to be each cover domain resolves to an IP address that is associated with a commercial

10:56.600 --> 11:03.000
Commercial VPS provider and the public facing server forwards all incoming traffic via a VPN to a blot not a bot

11:03.000 --> 11:06.560
But a blot server that handles actual connection requests from its clients

11:06.560 --> 11:08.040
I don't know why it's blot not bot

11:08.040 --> 11:11.340
But apparently it's this little server that sits there and handles the incoming connections

11:11.340 --> 11:17.580
Manages it it's set up for optional SSL if you want if the client has a valid cert it can do that

11:18.220 --> 11:22.500
And it says it's forwarded to a honeycomb tool server that communicates with the implant

11:22.540 --> 11:24.540
How about these words here, huh?

11:24.620 --> 11:32.700
If a valid certificate is missing the traffic is forwarded to a cover server then delivers it via an unsuspicious looking website

11:34.660 --> 11:37.100
The honeycomb tool server receives

11:37.100 --> 11:45.100
Exfiltrated information from the implant and an operator can also also task an implant to execute jobs on the target computer

11:45.340 --> 11:49.360
So the tool server acts as a command and control server for the implant as well

11:50.140 --> 11:56.060
Now there is a bit of a downside if you manage to infect a Windows box at the time of this

11:56.220 --> 11:59.780
Writeup didn't support automatic client update on Windows

11:59.780 --> 12:08.220
Yeah, however Linux rig can totally remotely update the implant totally good to go. Haha. It's got a cron job updates in the background

12:09.180 --> 12:11.180
Yeah, it is

12:11.580 --> 12:15.940
Yeah, that is Poby. Did you have I saw I saw you go by did you have something you wanted to jump in with?

12:16.480 --> 12:22.380
No, I just thought you know the fact that using like Ubuntu or whatever Linux distribution is interesting

12:22.380 --> 12:24.380
But I wondered if they'd used

12:24.380 --> 12:30.820
Anything that uses the JSON license given that their license explicitly says the software should we use for good not evil

12:30.820 --> 12:36.100
Hmm whether that would be a a way in which we could legally go after them for using the software

12:36.100 --> 12:36.660
Well, you know

12:36.660 --> 12:42.740
I was also reminded of the VMware lawsuit because there is some use of busy box in here

12:42.740 --> 12:47.860
They you they bundle busy box with some of their tools which made me wonder if maybe they're violating the busy box license

12:48.980 --> 12:53.900
And she's gone with VMware in trouble before wouldn't that be hilarious? It'd be like the Al Capone of the CIA

12:53.900 --> 12:55.740
Yeah, it really would be the busy box like yeah

12:55.740 --> 13:01.140
I saw some discussion of how like they couldn't some of the stuff isn't classified because because of the command and control nature for instance

13:01.140 --> 13:04.780
If it was transmitted or put on a machine that wasn't couldn't have classified information

13:04.780 --> 13:10.060
Oh Wow analysts could be fired or disciplined because it would be breaching the protocol for classified information

13:10.060 --> 13:16.740
What a what an interesting catch-22 can't like you you know leaked classified. It wasn't classified Wow

13:16.740 --> 13:19.740
I did not catch that part that is that is particularly interesting

13:19.740 --> 13:27.060
It's been it's been really interesting also speaking of things that guess what are interesting reading Edward Snowden's Twitter feed today

13:27.580 --> 13:29.180
I

13:29.180 --> 13:30.140
Think he's right

13:30.140 --> 13:36.460
And he says the big story is this is the first public evidence that the US government is secretly paying to keep US software unsafe

13:36.640 --> 13:44.540
So they they discover they they even they have teams that discover these vulnerabilities or they buy the known vulnerability off of

13:45.260 --> 13:47.260
Someone or some trading site

13:47.260 --> 13:53.380
They discover these things that are critical to devices that the American public has in use every day that they're doing

13:53.700 --> 13:56.580
God knows what with and they're not disclosing it

13:57.540 --> 13:59.540
They're leaving these flaws open

14:00.060 --> 14:04.860
nothing preventing another foreign government from discovering or buying the same flaw and

14:06.180 --> 14:08.180
Taking advantage of it instead of working

14:08.860 --> 14:12.780
The sort of the story that came out after the NSA leaks was well

14:12.780 --> 14:20.380
We yeah, we hold on to those zero days for a while, and then we inform the Microsoft's and the Apple of the world about them

14:20.380 --> 14:22.960
Oh except for these really important ones, okay?

14:22.960 --> 14:24.500
We don't tell them about those either

14:24.500 --> 14:30.300
But otherwise we totally work with them and then Microsoft even came out with a statement saying we do have a program that works

14:30.300 --> 14:33.220
With the NSA where they discover vulnerabilities, and we have included

14:33.940 --> 14:38.700
Vulnerabilities they've informed us about in previous patch sets like they just talked about like it was the standard operating procedure

14:38.700 --> 14:42.880
You're like okay. Well. This is just something that the private sector and the government have set up working together

14:42.880 --> 14:45.860
Nothing wrong with that sure what could go wrong right probably no problem sure

14:46.340 --> 14:51.600
Then you see this and you discover. Oh no no no they have a huge treasure trove of zero days

14:52.540 --> 14:54.540
hundreds of them actually and

14:54.740 --> 14:59.520
They just don't tell anyone and they just use them for their own benefit and just I guessed hope

14:59.520 --> 15:04.580
They just kind of hope that nobody else figures out these vulnerabilities exist. They just kind of hope it's all gonna work out

15:04.580 --> 15:12.500
it seems that way I mean I guess we were supposed to assume or trust that they are weighing that risk versus the

15:13.380 --> 15:14.420
intelligence

15:14.420 --> 15:18.300
Advantage of having these zero days, but is that really the case?

15:18.300 --> 15:22.060
I don't know and that I guess that's something maybe we can analyze now that we have these documents

15:23.460 --> 15:27.980
Is it also mean that people are more likely to start digging into what these are now that they know they're out there

15:27.980 --> 15:34.460
Yeah, hopefully all right anyone in the mumble room have any closing thoughts on this story before we move on probably not it's not very interesting

15:34.460 --> 15:38.060
No, no, okay. No all right well speaking of things that are interesting

15:41.060 --> 15:47.020
Whoa whoa did you hear that voice right there? That was the that was the up-the-nose shot of one mr. Brian Lundu

15:47.020 --> 15:50.940
It's a nice nose, and he is holding his final

15:51.660 --> 15:54.300
The last there will be no other

15:54.300 --> 15:58.540
Linux sucks talk. It's scale 15x this year and Brian

15:59.220 --> 16:03.500
Yeah, I just want to say as somebody who's you know been around when these started

16:03.500 --> 16:05.420
I think this was a long time ago

16:05.420 --> 16:09.940
This was your best hairstyle out of any Linux sucks talks you've ever given I think you really nailed it this year

16:09.940 --> 16:11.940
Why thank you. I did a full and complete

16:12.460 --> 16:18.660
retrospective of all of the various hairstyles because I felt like that was probably the most important thing to talk about that's why people would

16:18.660 --> 16:22.500
Be tuning in sure yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah most definitely yeah most definitely

16:22.500 --> 16:26.860
Yeah, most definitely yeah most definitely it was pretty fun. It was good. It was the last one

16:26.860 --> 16:29.660
I'm ever gonna do we did it on Thursday night at scale

16:30.420 --> 16:33.660
Rad yeah, yeah, I was able to watch some of it

16:33.660 --> 16:38.540
I was watching live because I didn't get to go to scale this year, and man was that live stream rough

16:38.540 --> 16:41.540
That was that was rough. Yeah, that was pretty brutal

16:41.540 --> 16:48.220
But you know it's it's conferences got the conference live streams and recordings always they always kind of suck like even the big ones

16:48.220 --> 16:53.220
I'm like the big festivals with like a tons of corporate backing. They're always pretty right to get right

16:53.220 --> 16:57.860
So the number one question everybody asks now is so what's the deal does Linux no longer suck, or do you just get tired?

16:57.860 --> 17:00.180
Of doing it. Oh, no, it still sucks

17:00.180 --> 17:05.340
It's just the same thing every time you remember Chris remember remember when we first started doing those back in

17:05.740 --> 17:11.100
What year was that 2000 2008 2009? Yeah, we started doing those remember the first three years

17:11.100 --> 17:15.500
I did it it was like the same slides every friggin year

17:15.500 --> 17:20.460
Yeah, like like it was the exact same slides and part of it is because I'm the laziest bastard on the planet

17:20.460 --> 17:24.140
But part of it was that it was like the same stuff to complain about every year

17:24.140 --> 17:30.060
I you know after after almost a decade of complaining about essentially the same things at one point

17:30.060 --> 17:33.260
You got to just like wrap it all up put a bow on that and say there

17:33.540 --> 17:37.820
Everyone just go reference that video until it's all fixed and then we can revisit

17:38.780 --> 17:43.060
Yeah, it's all it's now enshrined here. It is. This is the final version fix these things

17:43.060 --> 17:48.940
It's just that go do that right because that's worked so well since 2009. It's obviously

17:49.540 --> 17:53.140
It's played out perfectly winning damn strategy my friend now

17:53.140 --> 17:58.180
Did you find that it was there was trepidation early on trepidation?

17:58.180 --> 18:00.180
I guess early on do people little

18:00.500 --> 18:06.180
Larry of having somebody come out to their Linux event and talk about how Linux sucks because I could see some people not getting

18:06.180 --> 18:10.800
The right, you know not getting the inside joke. Remember we when we did the first one

18:10.800 --> 18:13.940
We did it up at Linux fest Northwest and we didn't call it Linux sucks

18:13.940 --> 18:16.860
We called it Linux sucks and what we can do to fix it

18:16.860 --> 18:20.820
Yeah, I made a very big deal about how this was a positive thing

18:20.820 --> 18:26.300
It wasn't just about complaining and whining and then once once that kind of was successful

18:26.300 --> 18:28.300
We were able to drop that whole

18:28.780 --> 18:33.180
Charade off and just focus on the sucky stuff. No more couching. Yeah. Yeah

18:33.180 --> 18:38.860
Yeah, I mean, I mean after I mean after the video start getting a million views. I mean people are like, oh, okay

18:38.860 --> 18:43.220
Yeah, you can you can come here and give my conference a ridiculous amount of press. Yes, that's fine

18:43.220 --> 18:46.460
Yeah, and it seems to always it always seems people see that, you know

18:46.460 --> 18:50.580
And even if they haven't seen the video before you see it on the program. You're like what? What is this?

18:50.940 --> 18:56.460
Who is this guy and what could he say? It's a you know, it's either you know about it or you're upset

18:56.460 --> 18:59.660
You're like, yeah, the only thing I so there I feel like there's probably two possibilities

19:00.300 --> 19:04.700
either you've thought of another way to get attention that's gonna be even better than saying Linux sucks or

19:04.700 --> 19:09.540
You're rolling the dice and assuming you're just gonna figure one out. Which one is it a

19:10.180 --> 19:12.180
little bit of both

19:12.180 --> 19:18.940
There could be something in the works there might be and if there were I would choose to be very sneaky about it and not

19:18.940 --> 19:23.180
Say anything until at least Linux fest Northwest rolls around. There you go. Yeah Linux. There's a good

19:23.180 --> 19:27.500
There's a good plug too for Linux fest Northwest. So I will be there you'll be up there this year, right?

19:27.500 --> 19:31.420
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Nice. Hey, I'm gonna live there for a couple days, you know, you know

19:31.420 --> 19:36.220
I've heard that you're good at using your words and talking perhaps you're gonna give it you're gonna give a speech

19:36.220 --> 19:39.100
You're gonna give a session you're gonna get up in front of crowd this time at Linux fest maybe

19:39.620 --> 19:43.260
You know, you know how much I hate crowds, you know me and you know me and

19:44.140 --> 19:48.620
It would depend maybe if Wes could fill in for me at the booth for a bit. I'll tell you what I'll tell you what

19:48.620 --> 19:53.060
What Chris I will do one with you. What would we do a talk about? What would we talk about?

19:53.060 --> 19:56.260
I don't even fucking care we can get up there and talk about shoes for all I care

19:56.260 --> 19:58.740
We'll get up you give me something good to talk about I'd do it

19:58.740 --> 20:04.540
I mean, I just you know, I got nothing to talk about because I talk shoes. I talk way too much during the week

20:04.540 --> 20:06.780
So what do I what else do I have to say, right?

20:06.780 --> 20:08.060
So I feel like it's all in the shows

20:08.060 --> 20:11.940
But if you gave me something new to riff on I could do it man. People would love it dude, right?

20:11.940 --> 20:14.460
People would get a serious kick. I don't even care what it is

20:15.020 --> 20:20.280
People in the mumble room and the audience of this show, whatever tell Chris what you would like me and Chris to riff on

20:20.500 --> 20:25.380
Yeah, or one hour and we'll do it. Yeah, although I

20:25.380 --> 20:31.060
There I think I think I think with this audience it could be kind of random. Yeah say potatoes good

20:31.060 --> 20:35.020
Yeah, no, I see I did I did potatoes for like half an hour at the oh, yeah

20:35.740 --> 20:42.500
So I gotta come up with something more esoteric than potatoes. Okay. Well, maybe we'll see we'll see what people say

20:42.500 --> 20:44.500
Let us know maybe something

20:44.620 --> 20:50.020
Something great. Yeah gripping. We got it. We should do something technically the the call for papers is already closed

20:50.020 --> 20:53.980
But I'm sure we could squeeze something in man. They'd get a kick out. We'll just go take over a room

20:53.980 --> 20:58.300
Yeah, I mean if we walk in there with cameras and microphones and lights people are probably gonna get out of our way

20:58.500 --> 21:01.180
So right they'll move either way. It's content

21:01.700 --> 21:04.380
You could almost do the history of Linux fest Northwest

21:04.980 --> 21:08.020
Could almost do that. I just don't really think that would be I

21:08.620 --> 21:14.540
Don't know. You'd have to have I don't know. It's either nothing like years of no, that's boring. Yeah, come on, man

21:14.540 --> 21:18.780
We gotta do something rad something gripping something that really grabs you by your cockles and just gives it a good yank

21:18.780 --> 21:22.540
I think we can do it. We could how about let's do stop using Ubuntu

21:22.540 --> 21:28.140
Well that that actually could get some attention stop using Ubuntu. It's a really not that much different than the Linux sucks

21:28.500 --> 21:35.540
Honestly, that's pretty much the gist of it. So we'll have the the final Linux sucks talk. It's up. Yeah

21:35.540 --> 21:37.540
Yeah, the fight the final one was out

21:38.180 --> 21:43.140
Just got a couple days ago yesterday. Yeah yesterday. Yeah, yeah less less than 24 hours ago

21:43.300 --> 21:43.940
All right

21:43.940 --> 21:49.780
So we'll we'll see how that one does find that on Brian's channel also have that linked in the show notes if you guys want to

21:49.780 --> 21:51.780
Check it out. It's also in the subreddit

21:51.780 --> 21:54.940
And and there is I don't know if you saw this Chris

21:54.940 --> 22:00.140
But one of my favorite shots from any of the Linux action shows or any of the videos the one with the flag

22:00.340 --> 22:02.340
The flag I saw that I did

22:03.940 --> 22:05.540
God about that

22:05.540 --> 22:09.100
Too I told was that from coding with Brian though. That was from coding with Brian

22:09.100 --> 22:14.540
Oh, no, that was just that was just the Linux action show remember we recorded it and you remember the year

22:14.540 --> 22:19.340
We went up to Linux fest and we had like a classroom. Yeah, we were gonna stream live from the whole time

22:19.340 --> 22:22.260
Yeah, the Internet sucked. Yeah, the audio it was terrible

22:22.260 --> 22:22.660
Yeah

22:22.660 --> 22:28.460
And so we recorded a little intro with the American flag behind me where I was telling oh, no bad the audio

22:28.460 --> 22:30.460
That wasn't even green screen

22:30.540 --> 22:35.300
That was legit flag. No, no, no, that was green screen. Oh, okay. We green screen. Oh, we did green screen

22:35.300 --> 22:38.620
Okay, right after we got that green screen. That's hilarious

22:38.620 --> 22:42.020
We and we were like we were just like farting around with like try to like do stuff

22:42.020 --> 22:47.300
So we also it's gaudiest American flag like, you know, how much better is that picture with that stash?

22:47.300 --> 22:50.540
I don't think it would have the same. I don't think it would have the same landing if you didn't have that

22:51.860 --> 22:52.820
I

22:52.820 --> 22:57.940
Am just eating beef in that picture and I don't even have beef in that picture. It's amazing. I

22:59.420 --> 23:05.340
Think it's the same jacket to no scarf anymore, but it's the same jacket. It was it was I realized that when I was up there

23:05.340 --> 23:08.780
I grabbed the same blazer the same brown corduroy blazer

23:08.780 --> 23:14.380
I had on and that was I don't know that was 2010 2011 something like that was forever ago, dude

23:14.380 --> 23:16.100
Yeah, but you just now breaking it in

23:16.100 --> 23:18.900
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, it's just starting to get soft. Fine. Yeah

23:19.780 --> 23:23.580
Yeah, you know, this is a 40 year blazer here. You got it. It's just getting warmed up

23:24.220 --> 23:26.300
particular category the 40 year blade

23:27.380 --> 23:29.940
Alright, mr. Lundu. Well, I know you had to go around this time

23:29.940 --> 23:36.300
So I do I I hate to jump in here be fantastical and Jared when I know my good friends

23:36.300 --> 23:41.040
Popey and wimpy are in the crowd, but guys you're gonna you're gonna have to do something rad without me

23:41.300 --> 23:45.420
You guys carry on do something somehow they will manage you'll manage I bet well

23:45.420 --> 23:51.220
Thank you for stopping by and congrats on a long run of the Linux sucks talks the Linux sucks

23:51.220 --> 23:57.060
Yeah, not not too damn shabby. Also. I was looking at it and if anyone wants to see early camera work from Chris fish

23:57.060 --> 23:59.060
No, you don't. Oh my god

23:59.820 --> 24:05.820
Don't do it the first year or two. We had a tripod and then like the third year we did it

24:05.820 --> 24:07.820
We were just like

24:08.020 --> 24:13.460
Yeah, you know what? I don't understand is like how come we never got that dialed in like I mean even now you're still shooting

24:13.460 --> 24:15.460
Up your face right here. Oh

24:16.180 --> 24:22.120
It's crazy. So this year right this year we had a sponsor for it. We had really good cameras set up for it

24:22.460 --> 24:29.380
So we had four cameras set up. Whoa, two of them came out awful like it was nice DSLRs

24:29.380 --> 24:32.980
They recorded it the image quality was good, but like the shots were just bad

24:33.740 --> 24:40.400
Like it was just terrible the one great like good-looking one. It's just like this like webcam. That's like up my nose. Yeah

24:40.400 --> 24:43.320
Yeah, we it's always always something. It's always something

24:43.320 --> 24:45.680
I feel like that's the style of Linux sucks though

24:45.680 --> 24:51.640
Like that's it's big like we had we recorded two completely separate years on those old and 900 camera phones

24:51.640 --> 24:55.200
Oh, yeah, and I know her phones. Yeah, just with some guy sitting in the audience really nice

24:55.200 --> 24:58.160
I just think they're holding it or freaking out

24:58.880 --> 25:02.420
And the and the battery didn't last very long on it

25:02.420 --> 25:05.760
So we had to have an extension cable run so we could hold it there

25:05.760 --> 25:11.420
So it was charging over USB while he was holding this cheap cheap little camera phone and then that

25:11.600 --> 25:17.000
Particular show goes on to get out like a million. Yeah, go figure right go figure. That's see that's how you do it

25:17.000 --> 25:21.340
Chris you got it. You got to go cheap cameras. Yeah cheap microphone, right? Make sure it's as bad as possible

25:21.520 --> 25:24.440
Okay, and then you get like a million views. Okay, I'm taking notes. I'm taking no

25:24.440 --> 25:28.040
Yeah, I'm just you know a little bit schooling little bit schooling help you out a little thank you

25:28.040 --> 25:33.920
I appreciate that I got it all I'm gonna get rid of this microphone. All right. All right. Hey guys. Hey guys look behind you what?

25:33.920 --> 25:35.920
Where'd he go?

25:36.160 --> 25:39.840
Well, there you go. We'll have that all linked up in the show notes. And hey Brian, you're still here

25:39.840 --> 25:42.000
What are you doing? Don't you know how to work mumble close that thing?

25:42.440 --> 25:45.600
Get out of here. Come on. All right. So before we go on

25:46.480 --> 25:53.660
Let's stop and thank Linux Academy for sponsoring this week's episode of the unplugged program so much more to get into Linux Academy

25:54.560 --> 25:57.080
Unplugged that's where you go to sign up support the show and

25:57.840 --> 25:59.840

That's amazing that is me and my mind literally exploding at the awesomeness of this key get into the platform

26:08.400 --> 26:12.360
You can dig around and really figure out how Linux Academy might work for you

26:12.360 --> 26:18.880
They have labs to give you hands-on scenario based learning instructor mentoring when you need videos with self-paced in-depth courses

26:19.080 --> 26:24.080
Whether you're an experienced sysadmin or new to the world of Linux Azure and AWS

26:24.360 --> 26:29.140
OpenStack and DevOps a sharp skill set is an absolute necessity to succeed

26:29.140 --> 26:31.140
meet Linux Academy

26:31.140 --> 26:38.740

sysadmins of every experience level use Linux Academy to stay on the bleeding edge of the Linux ecosystem. You should too

27:14.940 --> 27:16.620
Linux Academy comm slash

27:16.620 --> 27:23.280
Unplugged one of the things that I love about Linux Academy is they have a little breathing room now to engage with the community

27:23.280 --> 27:29.140
And it's really exploding. I mean they have a great community on their own, but they're now engaging with the wider Linux community

27:29.140 --> 27:31.420
They're going to a lot of these events. They were like scale. They're at scale

27:31.420 --> 27:34.620
I'm hoping they go to Linux fest that way we can get a chance to hang out with them

27:34.620 --> 27:37.700
It's a company in a really sweet spot of growth right now

27:37.700 --> 27:43.040
They're not only they're doubling down investing on their content and their staff and making your subscription more valuable all the time

27:43.100 --> 27:47.380
But they're doubling down on their engagement with the community Linux Academy comm slash

27:47.380 --> 27:54.660
Unplugged in a big. Thank you the Linux Academy for sponsoring this here Linux unplugged program this one this one right here

27:54.660 --> 27:58.220
I want to give a I want to move on I want to talk about Mobile World Congress and

27:58.880 --> 28:03.820
Odd camp, but maybe to slide us into that to prepare us to get our bodies ready

28:04.060 --> 28:07.020
Let's talk a little bit about the story of Firefox OS

28:07.020 --> 28:11.040
I thought this was an interesting piece and just this shot of the booth

28:11.420 --> 28:16.140
It's really something it really is look at that look at that look at that investment

28:16.140 --> 28:18.980
Just right there now. You know canonical is just at Mobile World Congress

28:19.660 --> 28:25.780
Massive booth really a housebooger that crazy bigger this booth bigger than bigger than my house

28:26.060 --> 28:28.980
Bigger than maybe as big as the studio. It was a big-ass

28:29.540 --> 28:36.060
Big-ass big-ass booth, so I'd like to tell you this is the guy writing this from Firefox from boot to gecko all the way

28:36.060 --> 28:38.060
up to the software project

28:38.660 --> 28:43.740
Dying in 2016 and he writes out where they went wrong. It's an interesting write-up about Firefox OS

28:43.740 --> 28:46.260
I don't know if we need to spend a lot of time going into it

28:46.260 --> 28:50.100
But I thought I would point it out to the audience who's curious about these these free software

28:50.620 --> 28:56.420
Operating systems for mobile devices and maybe where they've gone wrong now that these folks involved like this guy

28:56.420 --> 29:00.920
Who was a product developer have a little hindsight? Yeah perspective you can look back at it and go well

29:00.920 --> 29:05.380
Where did we go wrong? So that's it's interesting from that perspective now. I

29:06.660 --> 29:10.580
Want to segue not so brilliantly into Mobile World Congress

29:10.580 --> 29:17.340
Where popi and wimpy have just returned from this is this is a comparison that people will often make we'll look at canonical

29:17.340 --> 29:19.800
They're investing so heavily in mobile

29:21.140 --> 29:25.300
Which is kind of like how do you how do you know where they invest their money? How do you know?

29:25.300 --> 29:28.620
What are you basing that on? What are you basing that? How do you know what returns they get from that?

29:28.620 --> 29:31.860
But anyways, it's a common criticism that you hear lobbied at them quite a bit

29:31.860 --> 29:33.700
And they did indeed have a big presence

29:33.700 --> 29:36.780
So I kind of wanted to get a little perspective from a couple of the booth babes

29:36.780 --> 29:41.540
I mean a couple of the guys that were there popi and wimpy what they thought of it all and and sort of walking away

29:41.540 --> 29:47.100
From it. What is the reason canonicals there? And I don't know maybe if I was gonna go what should I expect?

29:47.100 --> 29:51.780
So popi, I'd love to start with you. I know that I think following your Twitter feed

29:51.780 --> 29:57.940
I saw I saw several different tweets about about the event about having fun. I'm guessing you must have had a great time

29:58.860 --> 30:00.940
Yeah, it's my first time at MWC

30:00.940 --> 30:06.020
I've never been there before and I kind of had to ask around in the company to find out what to expect but

30:06.020 --> 30:10.180
overall it was an overwhelming experience and I

30:10.940 --> 30:14.980
Like the size of the place I couldn't get over it. It was just humongous

30:15.420 --> 30:21.620
So many halls that are the whole building buildings were built specifically for MWC

30:21.620 --> 30:25.780
Wow, it's it's just gigantic and we had a sizable booth

30:25.780 --> 30:31.020
I mean you look at other people's booths like the giant companies like Huawei and Nokia and and

30:31.020 --> 30:35.860
Companies like that. They had really gigantic booths that were like the size of a town

30:36.300 --> 30:40.360
Whereas ours was you know, pretty big for a free software development company

30:42.060 --> 30:43.780
Part of the town

30:43.780 --> 30:49.520
Yeah, it was comparable in size to LG who were opposite us on the on the strip

30:51.100 --> 30:52.620
Keeping up with the Joneses

30:52.620 --> 30:57.580
It wasn't it wasn't like we had a tiny little postage stamp size one compared to all the others

30:57.580 --> 31:01.820
But what was really nice was like the diversity of stuff that was on the stand

31:01.820 --> 31:07.560
It wasn't just here come and get an Ubuntu CD or here's a Ubuntu phone that you can't buy

31:07.660 --> 31:12.100
You know, there was there's a there was a whole load of stuff and it wasn't just canonical

31:12.100 --> 31:12.900
It wasn't just Ubuntu

31:12.900 --> 31:17.460
There was a whole lot of their demoing stuff and I I know while we were standing there

31:17.860 --> 31:21.100
Demoing our stuff that me and Martin were talking about there

31:21.100 --> 31:26.180
there were just so many other things to see and do which was great because people spent ages on the stand and

31:26.180 --> 31:28.740
Spent ages talking to us now

31:29.580 --> 31:31.580
Limpy I was curious from your perspective

31:31.740 --> 31:36.520
This is a pretty big event where you're going and showing off some of the hard work of either yourself or teammates

31:37.180 --> 31:41.260
Was it did you feel a bit on display? Was it was it like here's our hard work?

31:41.260 --> 31:43.860
What do you think or was it was it a different vibe?

31:46.540 --> 31:51.300
Yeah, it was to some extent it was here's what we've been working on

31:51.300 --> 31:56.940
So specifically what Popey and I and our team with Eve and Jamie

31:56.940 --> 32:01.980
We're we're showing was all our stuff to do with Ubuntu core and snaps

32:01.980 --> 32:06.780
And we were introducing that to developers who are at MWC

32:07.260 --> 32:13.820
hmm, and it was interesting because those conversations went very differently from the conversations that you have with

32:14.900 --> 32:17.000
traditional open source projects so

32:17.000 --> 32:23.920
Software developers who just want their software out there and they want to get it on as many devices as possible as easily as possible

32:24.600 --> 32:29.040
the whole snaps and Ubuntu core story really resonated with them and

32:29.720 --> 32:31.720
the feedback was

32:31.920 --> 32:33.520
overwhelmingly positive

32:33.520 --> 32:36.480
But then you're saying, you know Ubuntu has

32:37.120 --> 32:39.960
From our you know from the discussions we've had here

32:40.080 --> 32:44.520
The Ubuntu mobile story has been about the phone and the tablet in the past

32:44.520 --> 32:51.760
But going into this what I've learned is just like the rest of the IT industry has embraced

32:53.040 --> 32:54.720
virtualization and

32:54.720 --> 32:56.560
containerization in order to

32:56.560 --> 33:03.600
Get more value out of their servers and pack the most amount of functionality into the equipment that they've got deployed in places

33:03.840 --> 33:07.640
The telecommunications sector are doing exactly the same thing

33:07.640 --> 33:15.280
So they have been buying great big devices that have single purpose and single function and these are very expensive

33:15.880 --> 33:17.280
bits of kit

33:17.280 --> 33:23.880
but they are now moving to a software defined platform where they are rolling out their new era of

33:24.160 --> 33:27.000
networks based on open stack and

33:27.920 --> 33:32.040
software to define software defined radios software defined networks

33:32.040 --> 33:40.400
virtual network function infrastructure, so it turns out that because Ubuntu is the dominant platform in the cloud and

33:41.160 --> 33:42.480
supports

33:42.480 --> 33:45.200
open stack Kubernetes and LexD

33:46.120 --> 33:53.440
Transparently throughout the you know, the stack of offerings that Ubuntu has the telcos are queuing up to

33:54.680 --> 33:59.920
rework their internal infrastructure on Ubuntu using those cloud technologies

33:59.920 --> 34:04.200
You know Wes and I went to the open daylight summit that was put on by the Linux Foundation

34:04.200 --> 34:08.200
I bet you were yeah, because it was a lot of this was really was yeah exactly that a lot of

34:08.640 --> 34:14.640
Data centers that look like they're there multiple data centers that look like one flat network

34:14.720 --> 34:20.320
That is all both spun up on-demand different connections are created by software defined networking

34:20.320 --> 34:26.400
Now they were hoping people would be using open daylight to manage it all or to I guess it's back to network. Yeah

34:26.400 --> 34:32.380
Yeah, anyway, but hmm. This is you know, it's it's big. It's a big and it's a big

34:33.000 --> 34:36.240
Infrastructure reorganization on the back end. That's totally transparent to consumers

34:36.240 --> 34:41.680
Yeah, exactly and we don't exactly you don't even realize it's happened. I mean we hardly know and we're we wait

34:42.240 --> 34:44.360
Yeah, we went to an event about it

34:44.360 --> 34:46.680
We can hardly tell and it's you know

34:46.680 --> 34:50.080
It's interesting to hear you echo that wimpy because it's that's that's exactly what we observed too

34:50.080 --> 34:56.920
And the and the driver for the telcos is that they're they're losing sort of they're losing the fight against the big cloud

34:57.200 --> 34:59.360
Providers and the data centers of the world

34:59.960 --> 35:01.560
And they need to compete there

35:01.560 --> 35:06.380
They need to be in that space and that's why they're going to be using many of the same

35:06.600 --> 35:09.360
Technologies to offer much of the same capability

35:10.240 --> 35:12.600
Interesting probably you were gonna say something

35:13.120 --> 35:18.480
No, I was just it was interesting to me that the people who were coming by the booth

35:18.480 --> 35:23.700
the way the MWC works on the first day you get these scouts come by the

35:24.000 --> 35:28.360
By the booth and these are scouts from some of the like biggest companies you've heard of

35:29.720 --> 35:35.160
Checking out what's on the booth and checking out the demos and they go away and then the next day on the Tuesday

35:35.240 --> 35:40.880
they come back with their CEOs and CTOs and the execs to actually see the thing for themselves and

35:41.400 --> 35:47.360
It was it was interesting to me to see these scouts going around and asking loads of questions and then coming back the very next

35:47.360 --> 35:50.280
Day with different people alongside them to demo

35:51.000 --> 35:55.080
You know, whatever it is software-defined radio or Ubuntu core or OpenStack or whatever

35:55.560 --> 36:01.040
And and seeing our salespeople talking to their people was was quite entertaining

36:01.760 --> 36:09.000
Yeah, a boy wouldn't that be wouldn't that just be one more perfect industry for Linux to completely take over?

36:09.680 --> 36:15.640
Just and and not because not because the bunch not because they're like big Linux enthusiasts

36:15.640 --> 36:18.400
But simply because it's solving a problem for the whole problem

36:18.400 --> 36:25.000
and the reason why I like that is it it forces these companies to get involved in a way that is beneficial to their

36:25.360 --> 36:27.360
long-term viability and

36:27.840 --> 36:29.840
Once they get all in on something like this

36:30.160 --> 36:33.080
Linux and all of this technology stack becomes part of that

36:33.080 --> 36:38.760
Well, we have to we have to get involved from a long-term viability standpoint and Wes and I talked from I think it was two

36:38.760 --> 36:40.760
different people from AT&T

36:40.760 --> 36:42.760
somebody from Ericsson

36:42.760 --> 36:49.280
Where else I know we talked to we talked to a wide range of companies that were getting involved in open source simply because they're

36:49.280 --> 36:51.280
now moving into this field

36:51.280 --> 36:53.600
It becomes the toolset that they use and

36:53.760 --> 36:58.800
the way to get the easiest way and the best way for them to get the things that they need changed or fixed or improved is

36:59.040 --> 37:02.440
Contribute to upstream and the Linux Foundation is trying to figure out a way to you know

37:02.440 --> 37:05.640
Kind of get in on this a little bit because they feel like well

37:05.640 --> 37:08.120
We should be there setting the standard setting this, you know

37:08.120 --> 37:11.760
so I and I don't know if they're getting I can't I don't have a good sense if they've

37:11.760 --> 37:17.440
If they've got a lot of traction, did you guys see a lot about anything about open daylight or the Linux Foundation at mobile?

37:17.440 --> 37:18.360
world congress

37:18.360 --> 37:20.360
Nope, no. Oh

37:21.080 --> 37:23.080
Yeah, that seems like the event should be at though

37:23.320 --> 37:29.840
One thing that I did see like conversely the flip side of the the big wigs and the execs and the scouts on the Monday

37:29.840 --> 37:36.040
Tuesday Thursday, they open the conference to local students who all come in. So it's a very different crowd

37:36.040 --> 37:41.320
Wow, yeah, and we got rid of them lanyards and stickers that

37:42.760 --> 37:48.240
Number of people who came by and told it like before we'd even talk to them about anything before we'd ask them any questions

37:48.240 --> 37:50.320
They were like, yeah, I already use a bun to it's on my

37:51.400 --> 37:57.920
It's like so many people every single day telling us how yeah, they they use a bun to they love it people telling us

37:57.920 --> 38:01.580
They've got their Dell XPS in their bag and they carry it with them everywhere and stuff like that

38:01.580 --> 38:09.080
That really made it worthwhile going and seeing like the real people and not and not just not just the students coming in

38:09.080 --> 38:12.240
who are studying computer science, but at the

38:12.680 --> 38:18.360
The food stands because obviously we were all in a bun to orange, you know

38:19.120 --> 38:26.320
Full full brand regalia, huh? So we got we got four urban two shirts at the start of this event one clean shirt for every day

38:26.960 --> 38:31.280
And when when you're at the food stands buying your food the number of people that were serving me said

38:31.280 --> 38:34.200
I love a bun to or going into the conference, you know

38:34.200 --> 38:40.680
The security guards and the people on the gate saying I use a bun to and people smiling at you from a distance as you're walking

38:40.680 --> 38:43.680
along and then when you get there like ha, you know

38:43.680 --> 38:49.060
I use a bun to or that is me walking around in your lunch break and people running up to you and tapping you on the

38:49.160 --> 38:54.040
Shoulder you have a bun. Yeah, it was it was really great. Really great. That was particularly enjoyable

38:54.640 --> 38:56.360
Wow

38:56.360 --> 39:03.480
Yeah, really now rumor has it that there may be a new episode of the Ubuntu podcast

39:04.040 --> 39:09.880
Soon to be released that may go into more details. Are these true rumors? Is this can you guys confirm this rumor?

39:11.840 --> 39:14.800
No, we can confirm those rumors I was scared there

39:17.560 --> 39:22.980
Yeah, okay, I tell you what I tell you what mark do you do you wanna do you want to explain what we've been doing this

39:22.980 --> 39:24.120
evening

39:24.120 --> 39:29.400
Well, we've been recording the Ubuntu podcast. Of course, very good. Probably talking a little bit about things that

39:30.320 --> 39:36.340
You can hear it on on Thursday. Very nice. In fact mark you're here with a little more breaking news

39:37.760 --> 39:39.280
in the

39:39.280 --> 39:45.300
Unplugged program. I believe another rumor came out on the 26th of February. This is a breaking

39:45.300 --> 39:51.620
It's just really late breaking news here that on cam 17 is on and a location has been chosen. Are these rumors true?

39:51.620 --> 39:55.180
These rumors are extremely true not fake news

39:56.020 --> 40:02.620
No, no, we don't do fake news over here or old facts. Yeah. Okay good one. Yeah, sure. So what's the details?

40:02.620 --> 40:05.860
What do I what are the dirty details that I need to know if I might want to go to our camp?

40:06.140 --> 40:11.780
So if you if you've not heard of our camp before our camp is what we call a free culture on conference

40:12.220 --> 40:14.980
so it's a conference with

40:14.980 --> 40:21.540
Not a lot of schedule but a lot of room for things if you want to come along and talk about your favorite thing

40:22.060 --> 40:27.100
and it's happening this year after taking a year off on the 19th and

40:27.460 --> 40:32.340
20th of August and it's happening in Canterbury in the UK. Okay

40:33.180 --> 40:35.180
so we've got a

40:35.420 --> 40:43.180
Building at the Canterbury Christ Church University and we've also got some accommodation at their student accommodation

40:43.180 --> 40:47.220
We've got a deal with them. The details of that are on the website

40:47.220 --> 40:51.860
I'll come to org and if you go to our camp to all you can also sign up for your ticket

40:52.300 --> 40:55.920
And as we've have done in previous years, we're doing pay what you want tickets

40:55.920 --> 41:01.180
So you can you can come for free or you can give us a bit of money if you want to nice

41:01.180 --> 41:06.620
I think that's really cool on camp 17 glad to hear it's back and I've always heard it's a good event

41:06.620 --> 41:13.140
Oh, yeah, definitely. Yeah. Oh one nice thing about the location actually this year is if you're in Europe

41:13.940 --> 41:15.860
You can actually get the train

41:15.860 --> 41:20.140
quite easily to Canterbury because you just get the Eurostar under the channel and

41:20.300 --> 41:24.580
Then you either change in Ashford or London and then you can get straight to Canterbury from there

41:24.620 --> 41:29.300
So it might be a bit more accessible than it has been when it's been up in the other end of the country

41:29.300 --> 41:35.500
Yeah, that is really nice. Especially for oh, I'd love to go. Oh, I got a good ticket. I got a I got it

41:35.500 --> 41:41.340
Well, hmm problem number one is I can't believe I'm in my mid-30s and I still don't have my passport

41:41.340 --> 41:43.700
So that's a that's something is problem

41:43.700 --> 41:46.540
It simply comes down to who has the time to do that

41:46.740 --> 41:49.660
Who has the time to drive around to three different places or whatever?

41:49.660 --> 41:52.740
It is get some stupid little picture and then get it put on another stool

41:52.740 --> 41:57.300
I don't have that wait around or to come my daughter's had a passport since she was four years old

41:57.300 --> 42:03.340
It should be ashamed. I am I literally only have the one really close neighbor and you don't need a pass, right?

42:03.340 --> 42:07.660
That's the thing that is the thing that is I just go up to Canada with it

42:07.660 --> 42:09.740
And in fact, if you take the boat, you don't even need the enhanced

42:09.740 --> 42:12.900
Oh, I can't I don't know what that's true anymore, but you didn't use a long time. Yeah. Yeah

42:13.460 --> 42:18.180
Just drop some inflatables to the RV. You'll be over in no time. I would oh if I could that'd be so great

42:18.180 --> 42:19.860
I really got to do it. I got to do it

42:19.860 --> 42:23.020
I just need a way I just this is why I need an assistant to have it

42:23.020 --> 42:25.420
You know take a picture of me go go do these things now

42:25.420 --> 42:28.980
If you want to hear more of these fine gentlemen, check out Ubuntu podcast org

42:28.980 --> 42:35.380
So this is gonna be season 11. Is that what's starting off 10? Oh, so it's already up then

42:35.820 --> 42:38.300
No, this is episode zero zero. Oh, it is

42:41.100 --> 42:45.860
Oh you guys are so confusing with the zero zero, so I like it though. It looks good

42:45.860 --> 42:50.100
It looks like just from a title that looks that looks good. Yeah

42:50.100 --> 42:55.540
This is the one thing to regenerate the guy who the guy who emailed in season one saying that we were

42:55.540 --> 43:01.980
We were sort of had ideas above our station for using a leading zero. This is the season that proves him wrong

43:02.860 --> 43:03.860
awesome

43:03.860 --> 43:05.860
Not that you guys hold a grudge

43:08.740 --> 43:12.940
We're gonna churn out 42 episodes just to prove him right

43:14.140 --> 43:16.740
Well, that might have been in his best interest in the long term

43:16.740 --> 43:20.780
I am boy I'm excited about our camp and even if I if I can't make it

43:20.780 --> 43:25.500
I'd love to hear a report back here on the show about it because that does look like it's gonna be a lot of fun

43:26.260 --> 43:28.780
You guys gonna record a live Ubuntu podcast there?

43:29.820 --> 43:34.400
Quite possibly. Yeah, that might happen. Yeah, that doesn't surprise me. Okay

43:34.400 --> 43:40.900
Well, although we should we should also mention we are going to be recording a live podcast later in the year on June the 24th

43:40.900 --> 43:42.100
in London

43:42.100 --> 43:48.280
So fostalk live that happened last August organized by Joe Ressington from late night Linux

43:48.280 --> 43:52.600
He's organizing another fostalk live this year and we are on the bill

43:53.120 --> 43:54.000
To do that

43:54.000 --> 43:58.360
So if you head to fostalklive.com when tickets get announced

43:58.360 --> 44:03.440
You'll be able to find the details there and get a ticket for the event. They'll be in very short supply small venue

44:03.440 --> 44:06.760
It's worth going for the laminated show notes alone. Oh, yes

44:06.760 --> 44:12.320
Well, yes, and if you're lucky if you if you make friends with poppy and buy him a beer, he might sign them for you

44:13.240 --> 44:16.520
Nice producing in Gobi in gobs as we used to call it

44:16.520 --> 44:19.960
So, you know guys I'm just putting this out there

44:19.960 --> 44:25.060
But if you actually stream the recording of the shows live some of us would tune in

44:26.000 --> 44:30.300
Just saying there might be an audience out there for that. It's not hard. Maybe you can do it

44:31.180 --> 44:34.480
You can do it. You don't even have to show your faces. You could just do an audio stream

44:35.240 --> 44:40.300
It'd be really fun. I know I think one day this whole live stream thing is gonna take off

44:40.300 --> 44:44.620
John I don't know. I've live streamed before. Yeah, okay

44:44.620 --> 44:48.860
I think maybe now that we've got a big telegram channel we can we can pimp it to them

44:48.860 --> 44:53.540
But before it was it was more effort than it was worth. Yeah. Yeah, I you know doing lie

44:53.540 --> 44:56.500
I remember doing live streams before Twitter and the only real reason I was

44:56.940 --> 45:00.440
Thankful Twitter kind of came along in some sense was because I had a way to let people know we were live

45:01.260 --> 45:02.380
Really?

45:02.380 --> 45:07.340
There was really no other mechanism and that makes me feel like an old man. All right, so we got to talk about scale

45:07.340 --> 45:09.700
We got a warp back to scale. I got a great interview by Noah

45:09.700 --> 45:11.180
With the gnome booth

45:11.180 --> 45:12.060
But before we do that

45:12.060 --> 45:17.940
I want to thank our good friends at ting for sponsoring this show linux dot ting calm linux dot ting calm you go there

45:18.540 --> 45:25.260
Support the show and get $25 credit now this $25 credit can be applied to a device you buy from ting like a maniac

45:25.300 --> 45:27.300
Direct from ting why not makes it nice and easy

45:27.460 --> 45:32.940
They can even find a device for you or if you bring in device, they'll give you $25 in service credits

45:32.940 --> 45:34.940
They like oh $25

45:35.740 --> 45:37.620
Pay for the line

45:37.620 --> 45:40.380
What are you stuck in some sort of duopoly quote-unquote agreement?

45:41.140 --> 45:47.220
Ting ting is mobile. It's different. You only pay for what you use. It's a flat rate boom six dollars for the line

45:47.220 --> 45:53.700
That's it. Six dollars six dollars six dollars guys for the line. Are you hearing that?

45:53.700 --> 45:57.820
I mean I could say it one more time, but it's just crazy at that point and then you just pay for usage on top

45:57.820 --> 45:59.260
of that

45:59.260 --> 46:01.260
What it's that straightforward?

46:01.700 --> 46:06.880
You got six dollars for the line. Oh, I did it again. Then you pay for what you use minutes messages megabytes

46:06.880 --> 46:10.540
So if you don't use many messages, you don't pay for them. You don't make a lot of phone calls

46:10.540 --> 46:12.540
You don't pay for it. You see how that works. It's simple

46:12.540 --> 46:16.660
And then it's uncle Sam's touch right off the top. That's gonna depend on where you live, bro

46:16.660 --> 46:21.000
I don't know. I can't put that don't put that on me. I don't know. That's what depends on you

46:21.340 --> 46:26.580
Anyways, you find out you go to linux.com you click on what would you save you get a little chart?

46:26.580 --> 46:30.980
It starts telling you about numbers you do the math you start realizing holy crap in two years

46:30.980 --> 46:34.500
I could have bought an entirely new laptop. I'm like three and a half years into this

46:34.500 --> 46:37.620
I got multiple lines a ton of laptops to I'm

46:40.620 --> 46:42.700
I'm all up in the tank. I got it for myself

46:42.700 --> 46:46.180
I got it for the business. It really makes a lot of sense and if I ever get stuck

46:46.180 --> 46:48.180
Which is really nice when I'm on the road

46:50.020 --> 46:53.380
Really good support really good really good so good

46:53.380 --> 46:59.300
They they stayed on the phone longer than they should have I didn't need I did not I did not expect that to get fixed

46:59.300 --> 47:04.180
I thought I was I legit was done like a half hour 40 minutes before they were I was like

47:04.180 --> 47:08.260
This is unsolvable. This is unsolvable. I don't even I you know I've been in IT for 15 years

47:08.260 --> 47:10.260
I can tell you this is unsolvable. You don't need to bother

47:10.460 --> 47:14.900
They stuck with and got it fixed which was super thankful and through it

47:14.900 --> 47:18.980
We was we were I was in Montana and through it was stopping by I was about to do

47:18.980 --> 47:21.620
I can't remember what show I think it might have been code or it might have been this show

47:21.620 --> 47:24.540
I was about to go live on the air my my fire died

47:24.540 --> 47:26.300
I didn't know what was going on

47:26.300 --> 47:31.140
I was parked in a gravel parking lot and ting save the day linux.com you go there

47:31.140 --> 47:36.260
You get the best mobile company in the biz you bring a device. They don't honey badger. They just go crazy

47:36.260 --> 47:43.340
They don't care. They're honey badger about it. You just use it however you want minutes messages megabytes, and you pay for it. It's simple also I

47:44.140 --> 47:45.620
Really like this blog series

47:45.620 --> 47:49.860
They've been doing if you go to linux.com and this is sort of applicable to any carrier

47:49.860 --> 47:52.780
I suppose but the five capable smartphones under $100

47:53.540 --> 47:56.300
Like we always talk about like you get like Wes over here with the pixel

47:56.300 --> 48:02.220
That's right, although you did rock the Nexus 5 for like ever ages. Yeah, so you totally earned that pixel

48:02.700 --> 48:05.220
Kind of you know you know if you're not ready to buy

48:05.420 --> 48:09.900
You're not ready to blow seven hundred dollars on a smartphone or even a thousand dollars in some cases way

48:09.900 --> 48:14.900
It's great about ting right whatever phone. You want whatever phone makes sense totally linux.com and a big

48:14.900 --> 48:18.300
Thank you to ting for sponsoring the unblocked program

48:18.660 --> 48:24.300
So let's talk to and well let's talk let's talk no let's talk endless

48:24.300 --> 48:31.540
Let's talk endless PC, and let's talk a little fedora. Oh, yes, that's right my friends. It's Noah at scale

48:38.980 --> 48:41.980
Walking around the scale floor we have to stop at Gnome anytime

48:41.980 --> 48:48.540
We see him obviously one of the favorite desktop environments of anyone that uses Linux. How are we doing today pretty good?

48:48.540 --> 48:54.780
How are you excellent so tell me a little bit about what the Gnome team is up to these days and also

48:54.780 --> 48:56.300
I know that you work for endless

48:56.300 --> 49:02.180
I would like to hear about endless the endless PC and the operating system that you've designed around no

49:02.420 --> 49:08.740
Yeah, for sure, so this is actually good timing because Gnome 324 the new version of Gnome is gonna be out

49:09.100 --> 49:15.740
In a couple of weeks. I think March 17th March 20th something like that and there are some pretty cool features

49:15.740 --> 49:22.260
In a new version of Gnome including a night shift filter like you have for instance on your phone

49:22.300 --> 49:28.900
That will tend to your screen with a natural light at night so that it doesn't strain your eyes as much

49:29.660 --> 49:32.320
There's a lot of features also for developers

49:33.300 --> 49:38.060
Gnome builder and flat back are two big pieces of our ecosystem

49:38.060 --> 49:41.940
and they're receiving a lot of new features for 324 and

49:41.940 --> 49:46.260
Christian is right here behind me busy writing code on ground builder right now

49:49.980 --> 49:57.060
Excellent so I know that you work for endless PC and you guys have designed it a very interesting operating system

49:57.420 --> 50:03.800
Around no might one might even say that it's like the anti cloud operating system it runs so offline, right? Yeah

50:03.800 --> 50:07.620
Yeah, so that's that's actually one of our core tenants at endless we

50:07.620 --> 50:15.340
we were the company was born a few years ago with the mission of bringing computers really to the whole world population to as

50:15.340 --> 50:17.340
many people as possible and

50:17.540 --> 50:22.140
There's really two barriers to doing that and one is the price of the hardware

50:22.260 --> 50:27.500
And that's why you know you see here some of the computers that we've made. They're pretty affordable. They're nice

50:27.500 --> 50:34.420
They're very compatible with Linux. They run very very well you turn them on and you know everything is ready for you the other

50:34.420 --> 50:42.380
Barrier typical barrier is the access to internet so the cost of connectivity or the access to connectivity at all

50:42.780 --> 50:46.140
So we bundled inside the OS a lot of features

50:46.940 --> 50:49.660
for consumption of content offline

50:49.660 --> 50:55.740
So we want to almost bring a lot of the value of internet into the box itself so when you buy it

50:55.740 --> 50:57.740
You will come preloaded with

50:57.820 --> 50:59.820
something like a hundred and fifty

50:59.820 --> 51:06.980
Offline applications on a variety of topics that you normally would Google things for life such as farming

51:07.980 --> 51:09.340
encyclopedia or

51:09.340 --> 51:12.020
Math or physics or biology or all these things?

51:12.860 --> 51:17.860
So it's a it's a really good value for for people that don't otherwise have access to that information

51:18.540 --> 51:20.540
The same way that we do here

51:20.780 --> 51:25.900
Excellent if people were interested in in endless. What is the what is the what is the?

51:25.900 --> 51:32.100
compelling use for the operating system if I didn't have an endless PC can I just can I go get the operating system and

51:32.100 --> 51:36.100
What kind of people here in the US where we do have an abundant internet? Where are those?

51:36.420 --> 51:38.620
What is that? What is your target audience here if any?

51:39.220 --> 51:46.940
Yeah, so that's a that's a that's a good question. We launched actually this hardware line specifically for the US market this year

51:47.580 --> 51:53.340
You can buy this from our website endless OS comm and also you can download a free

51:53.340 --> 51:59.900
The free operating system from there so you can download the exact OS that you would find inside the box

52:00.220 --> 52:03.640
For free from our website here in the United States. You're right

52:04.320 --> 52:06.580
Internet connection is much better

52:08.060 --> 52:15.180
But it's not that's not true everywhere so even inside the United States. There's a lot of places where that is useful

52:15.900 --> 52:17.780
And you know even in California

52:17.780 --> 52:22.140
There's a lot of remote areas where internet just doesn't get there because there's not enough people

52:22.140 --> 52:25.620
So if you live in one of those areas this could be useful for you another

52:26.020 --> 52:32.500
Interesting use case that we really had not thought about before when when we when we designed this but it turns out

52:32.500 --> 52:34.500
It's it's a pretty good match. It's actually

52:35.340 --> 52:37.340
prisons so they

52:37.700 --> 52:41.300
you know, there's there's a lot of people there to have time and they

52:42.020 --> 52:48.420
Want to study they want to learn new things, but they cannot access internet as a matter of policy, of course, so

52:48.420 --> 52:54.020
We're doing some pilots with prison systems in a few states in the u.s

52:54.020 --> 52:58.100
To see if this is a good match for them outstanding and how is that working so far?

52:58.620 --> 53:03.740
It's been working pretty well. Yeah, the feedback that we've that we've received is pretty good. There were some

53:04.700 --> 53:09.740
Things like we were shipping for instance open arena, which is a slightly violent game. We had to remove it

53:09.740 --> 53:16.380
So there's you know, you have to adjust things for specific for the use case, but it's been working well so far outstanding

53:16.380 --> 53:19.100
And so and you're providing the machines the hardware the software

53:19.100 --> 53:23.940
I mean, that's a story right in of itself that you guys are reaching out to these people that are you know

53:23.940 --> 53:31.940
That are in some ways underprivileged and and and providing them with with with skills and abilities that they can use if and when

53:31.940 --> 53:34.620
They ever leave the prison system

53:34.620 --> 53:40.300
They can become functioning adults back into society and they will know how to use a computer system exactly exactly

53:40.300 --> 53:44.200
Yeah, so yeah in some cases we've donated hardware in other cases

53:44.200 --> 53:47.700
we've partnered with associations that were already working in the prison and

53:48.260 --> 53:54.700
We installed it on the computers that they already had so endless is at the end of the day like another

53:55.260 --> 54:02.420
Linux based OS is compatible with the whole variety of a hardware that you know other districts like Ubuntu or Fedora are compatible with

54:02.420 --> 54:09.020
So you can run it on anywhere take a given that you also have a Fedora laptop is have you found that Fedora is a

54:09.540 --> 54:12.580
Is a good operating system for exemplifying. No

54:12.580 --> 54:18.820
Absolutely, I think Fedora is one of the distros that always strives to give the

54:19.540 --> 54:26.460
Vanilla gnome user experience to the user and actually in Fedora 25, which is what we have on the laptop there

54:26.460 --> 54:30.660
It's the first distro that I know of that ships with Wayland by default. So

54:31.340 --> 54:38.620
You know, we've been waiting for this moment kind of for many many years the point where we stopped using X and it's it's there

54:38.620 --> 54:45.540
And I have to be honest. I didn't even notice that I was using Wayland until maybe you know two weeks later

54:45.540 --> 54:51.420
I saw some like minor bugs, but it is really really polished. It's a really great distro. That's fantastic

54:51.420 --> 54:53.420
So you personally use Fedora on your computer?

54:54.220 --> 54:57.980
Yeah, I have on my work computer. I use Endless, but my personal computer is Fedora

54:57.980 --> 55:05.620
Nice, that's outstanding. And so is Endless a rolling release or is it a static build?

55:05.620 --> 55:07.900
Are they static build? Endless is

55:08.860 --> 55:12.900
It has a about a three-month release cycle. So we have

55:13.740 --> 55:16.480
major quote-unquote updates every three cycles

55:16.480 --> 55:20.160
So we go from version 3.1 to 3.2 to 3.3

55:20.340 --> 55:27.580
And then we have point releases about every three weeks to a month depending on exactly why we need to make a point release

55:27.580 --> 55:30.860
Sometimes there are critical bugs to be fixed though. We have to you know, make it quicker

55:30.860 --> 55:37.060
But no, new features only get out every two or three months. It's not a rolling release

55:37.060 --> 55:41.400
Now tell me what was the design thought behind this idea of on the screen here

55:41.400 --> 55:44.140
We have you can see where like these icons are in the center

55:44.140 --> 55:48.020
And if I if I click down, you know here there's like a traditional menu structure

55:48.020 --> 55:53.300
But we have occupied the majority of the desktop space with application shortcuts and interestingly enough

55:53.300 --> 55:53.860
You know

55:53.860 --> 55:58.340
We started back in the 90s where we had a bunch of things cluttering the desktop and then we kind of went away from that

55:58.340 --> 56:02.980
But the reality is now like a mino machine. It's just I just have a pretty picture

56:02.980 --> 56:07.100
It's really wasted a desktop real estate and you've you've actually taken that up with useful shortcuts

56:07.300 --> 56:13.780
Almost kind of like in between a dock. Tell me about that. Yeah, so the idea for the icon grid specifically

56:14.220 --> 56:19.240
Is to be familiar for users that are used to smartphones and tablets

56:19.240 --> 56:24.060
So that's actually how you know your Android launcher or your iOS

56:24.060 --> 56:29.580
application list works so endless the desktop works

56:30.100 --> 56:33.060
Similarly, you cannot put your files on the desktop

56:33.700 --> 56:40.040
It's really the launching page for all of your apps. So we try to start with a minimal

56:41.060 --> 56:43.740
number of apps on the desktop so that the user is

56:44.580 --> 56:47.140
Invited to explore the App Center

56:47.340 --> 56:52.700
Which is based on GNOME software where you can you know add more apps to your desktop or download more things

56:52.700 --> 56:56.300
from the internet download more bundles and expand your

56:57.100 --> 57:02.700
list of available apps basically outstanding if people were interested in more

57:03.260 --> 57:10.020
Information about GNOME or endless. Where could they go? So endless OS comm is the endless website from there?

57:10.020 --> 57:12.020
You can find everything. There's also

57:12.500 --> 57:15.820
Forums and a slack community if you're interested in participating

57:15.820 --> 57:24.060
for GNOME a GNOME org is our main website and you can also find us on IRC IRC.GNOME.org and

57:24.900 --> 57:29.660
The GNOME Wiki has a lot of information about the release and you know

57:29.660 --> 57:33.180
The whole release process if you are interested in contributing back

57:33.180 --> 57:39.540
So wiki.GNOME.org but GNOME.org is the main homepage outstanding cosmo GNOME.org. Thank you so much for your time

57:39.540 --> 57:49.540
We really appreciate having you. Thank you. Thank you

57:49.540 --> 57:53.260
That endless PC is actually pretty interesting because they got this mission now

57:54.020 --> 57:58.820
The mission one is a gorgeous Linux powered desktop. Yeah, it's like on a bamboo case

57:58.820 --> 58:03.140
Which has always kind of pushed my buttons the wood PC cases have always kind of done it for me

58:03.740 --> 58:06.300
And I haven't really tried out endless OS yet

58:06.300 --> 58:11.860
But after that interview, I was a little more tempted to maybe go give the ISO a download. So the mission one is

58:13.860 --> 58:20.060
$250 and you can either get it with 320 gigabytes of storage or 500 gigabytes of storage and

58:20.540 --> 58:22.540
I don't remember

58:22.940 --> 58:24.740
Oh, yeah, here it is

58:24.740 --> 58:31.780
Yeah, it's an Intel Celeron N2807 in it. It's got two gigabytes of DDR3 RAM

58:31.780 --> 58:38.620
So that's kind of your base performance metrics. Then it's got two USB 2.0 ports one USB 2.0 port

58:39.420 --> 58:41.020
Hopefully one of those three

58:41.020 --> 58:47.620
So three USB ports maybe or maybe one of those actually it's a typo and I meant to write USB 3.0 VGA HDMI out

58:48.340 --> 58:50.340
headphone jack Ethernet

58:50.860 --> 58:53.340
Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth I guess

58:54.940 --> 59:00.720
You know for 250 bucks, that's that's not too bad that's not too bad and they really are

59:00.720 --> 59:03.900
you know, you listen to that guy they really got an idea of philosophy behind this and

59:04.780 --> 59:08.340
I kind of thought I'm not always a big fan of yet another derivative

59:08.340 --> 59:13.740
No, but I don't know what I don't know how much they've I don't know how extended of nomad is I from what I did

59:13.740 --> 59:15.580
I did a little reading a little research for the show

59:15.580 --> 59:19.220
It looks like it's based on a slightly newer or I'm sorry slightly older version of gnome

59:19.220 --> 59:24.060
I want to say 320, but I'm not positive. It was somewhere in that range interesting

59:24.060 --> 59:28.560
So it's it's it's a fork or at least as a layer of extensions on top of gnome 3. I'm not quite sure

59:28.560 --> 59:31.840
but it didn't look very usable so I

59:33.000 --> 59:39.320
Might be I might be giving the endless the endless ISO download trying to think of like who in my life would would or could use

59:39.320 --> 59:40.320
that

59:40.320 --> 59:44.200
But I suppose if you're just really using web apps and you know

59:44.200 --> 59:51.120
You don't want a big ugly weird box in your nicely decorated living room or computer room that it sits nicely on the desk

59:51.120 --> 59:53.240
I guess I could see that. Yeah, I think yeah

59:53.240 --> 59:55.920
I think if you had yeah, I could see a lot of family members that yeah

59:55.920 --> 01:00:01.040
I could see a lot of people why we're talking about gnome see I'm give a little gnome love because are you still using plasma?

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.520
By the way, yep, I wish to talk about that

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:07.200
But there's also a write-up at fedora magazine org on getting more out of gnome notifications

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:12.600
Which is a thing no notifications, which are not bad not bad at all my friend and with a few tweaks

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.680
Maybe a few extensions or things like that you can get even more

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.240
Include including creating your own

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.300
Notifications like things on the command line so that's also linked in the show notes so Wes

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:29.300
Did you end up playing around with like controlling where the screens will go or your where your windows go on your screen based on?

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:31.180
Keyboard commands, I know that was something a little bit

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:35.020
I have a list of things to try that I have not gotten to so I started playing with that

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:37.420
I got a couple things set up, but there's a couple

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:42.340
Plugins and settings that have been recommended to me that I have not got around to trying yet

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:46.480
There's some stuff. That's a little more replicate replicate some of the stuff that I three or similar does

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:52.420
So I'm looking forward to extend it more or see if it can meet my needs because I'm really liking a lot of the other

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:54.740
Stuff the one thing that I keep messing up though

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:57.600
I'm used to like when I have the lock screen on gnome

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:01.060
I have to hit enter and then I type you don't have to but I'm just used to doing it

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:04.640
But if you do that on the plasma lock screen boom now. I have the time out

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:09.700
Yeah, I have to learn something so but I'm trying to I want to stick with it long enough that those things have all gone

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.940
Away, and I can give it really a better understanding of if it works for me

01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:17.060
So I had two things this week with the with my adventures with plasma

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:19.860
And I thought they were both noteworthy for mentioning here on the show

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:25.060
I finally got a chance to getting around to play with KD connect because I'm back on

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:29.180
Android and back on my Nexus 6p, and so I just took advantage of I was like well

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:34.360
This is one more way. I can use the plasma desktop now. I really like that. I really do like it

01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:39.000
I'm not so sure if I want notifications that are showing up on my Android device show up in my desktop yet

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.940
I'm still like feeling that out, but just some of the basic functionality. It's it really feels like

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:51.760
2017 I mean it's nice and it's so much more practical than what I seemed to grok with the like that the iOS

01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:58.460
Functionality, I guess maybe iOS I don't know if there's a way to like share your clipboard with the Mac desktop with where with their

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:01.660
Handoff stuff, but I know you can like open up like links and web pages

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:05.820
But it's it's not nearly as nice as like it is with Katie connect can a kitty connectors

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:09.820
It seems very thoughtfully made it's one of those things that would make me want to stay on Android mm-hmm

01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:15.860
I'm also working on iOS support. Oh really well there you go. I wonder if it'll be nearly as functional

01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:19.300
Yeah, that's something to watch yeah, because it's it's always running on the phone, right?

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:21.300
It's you can get it from the Play Store and

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.980
Then the other thing the other just sort of noteworthy

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:29.440
Adventures with plasma this week would be I decided to set up the Macbook Pro that we set up

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:34.300
Months ago on the show running arch I've switched that over to the plasma desktop from no hey

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:39.980
Yeah, and this was my first time setting up plasma desktop on a high DPI display where?

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:45.500
Everything was high DPI by default. How did that go? I'm curious. I I it was great

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:52.840
I think I tweaked the mouse cursor a bit, but on all my previous installations of plasma on a high DPI display. I've always

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:56.840
My first instead right after install. It's everything's tiny

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.680
It's all really tiny and you got to go into the settings

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:04.580
And you got out you guys turn up the scale and turn up the font DPI and you got to change you know

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:06.140
Some of your window sizes

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:11.040
I did still have strange windows that like rendered way too small like it like the size of a 640 by 480

01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:14.780
Resolution just tiny little window they have to resize to see the entire UI

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:19.900
but out of the box after I installed plasma desktop just

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:25.820
Logged out and logged into the plasma desktop and everything was high DPI. I didn't have to change a damn thing. That's awesome

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:27.820
It is it is really nice to see him going that direction

01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:35.180
So I still so I guess my my take is I'm getting deeper into the plasma ecosystem now with KDE Kinect and

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:41.740
I've put plasma desktop on my main driver at home the the Macbook run an arch with now plasma

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:48.140
Yeah, I haven't really I haven't really felt the need to reinstall and go to like KD neon or yeah

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:54.820
Same thing yeah, yeah, and plasma 510 is just around the corner sure

01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:58.660
Never hey, that's sure yeah sure all right. Let's talk about the light book

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:01.740
I think producer Michael's been following this one pretty closely

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:06.660
I'd like to get his his thoughts on it because it seems like a pretty good deal, but is it too good to be true

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:09.980
I'll tell you about something. That's great, and it is true

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:15.940

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:32.980
They're lightning fast networking with 40 gigabit connections coming right into them hypervisors. Oh those hypervisors. Yeah, they run Linux

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:35.580
They use KVM for the virtualizer pal

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:43.180
You got Linux for the base operating system SSDs for all the disk i.o. 40 gigabit connections data centers all over the world in choice

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:49.660
Locations highly available block storage which you can attach up to 16 terabytes love it and an interface

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:54.340
The interface is beautiful. It's the best interface. It's huge. It's great

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:55.840
It is so well done

01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:02.140
And it doesn't matter if you're a total noob like you barely even understand that web servers are a thing and you need a website

01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:07.820
You could manage to use this to somebody who's been setting up virtual servers for literally their entire

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:11.380
Career will find this to be a great interface. How do they do it?

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:16.940
I think they're from the future. Yeah, I can't really I can't square it. Otherwise

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:21.100
Either that or they had this great API and they're like damn

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:27.060
This API is so dank that we need an interface that comes close to being as dank as our as our API

01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:32.940
That's the only two things I can figure I can only it's either they're from the future or that dank API is so dank

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:36.900
They had to have a dank interface. That's the only thing I can figure so you got to check it out yourself

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:42.020

This on here this here right now

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:01.820
upload program

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:07.900
So the light book is it a scam is it a total scam is it from?

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.620
2014 for two hundred and forty nine dollars

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:17.460
they say you can get a 32 gigabyte msata drive or you can pay a little more and get up to 512 gigabytes of

01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:25.100
Storage they say it's got Linux by default elementary OS at that a 1080p display 4 gigabytes of RAM and

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:27.620
an Intel Celeron quad-core

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.600
processor

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:32.400
Hmm

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:36.560
250 bucks it seems to be the new sweet spot right everybody's trying to hit 250 bucks and

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.880
The only the only thing that's weird about this outside from just things

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:44.720
I've noticed just looking at this all of the product images are totally gimped

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.960
There's no there's no real shots of the computer

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:52.560
But it looks like you can also find this exact image with like a video game

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:55.920
Gimped into it or you're probably in this case. It was photoshopped

01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:02.400
Just probably I would assume running Windows just the exact same product shot just a different complete

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.920
Operating environment on the screen

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.560
Going back for years now. It's so that's a little weird

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:13.400
That's a little concerning, but but maybe but maybe but maybe what they're doing is they're taking something that's been around since 2014

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:19.820
They're rebranding it and because it's fairly old the margins are super low so they can sell for 250 bones

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
that's the reasonable take but

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.080
Producer Michael you've been sniffing around. What's your take you think it's a scam

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:30.040
Do you think there's something else going on here, or is this a legit rig?

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:35.580
I've no idea. It's it's more the thing of it looks really promising

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.760
But it feels a little sketchy with the photos with the fact that

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:45.640
There is no name associated to the company that there's no person's name when you go to their forum

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:51.040
It just says director as the person replying like there's absolutely no name. There's no photos

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:57.360
There's one video on YouTube where it shows a person's face because he's recording the lap the light book

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:04.160
With his phone and then the reflection of the of him is in the in the screen

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.320
so

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:10.520
It's just which is kind of feels weird, but like the photos thing

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:15.280
Every photo that's on their website except for the the software photos

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.780
But all the product photos are also on like Alibaba and stuff like that

01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:22.780
I I it just seems odd that they're not being more

01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:28.300
Transparent about the company structure, but I mean I found out they are supposedly

01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:33.860
Located in Tampa, Florida, and that's where they ship from so there's no international shipping

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.700
for US people and

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:44.580
The price like I found out what the processor is it's a 3050 Celeron, which is a pretty good Celeron

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:51.820
It's better than a Chromebooks normal typical processor 31 50 right 31 50 I

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:56.540
Yeah, I think 31 50. I don't remember exactly number, but I'm pretty sure it's 31 50 and so it's a decent

01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:59.940
Yeah, it's it's better than the average Chromebook

01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:04.860
There's a couple things I tell you that and I think this came out via reddit posts

01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:08.140
And they were applying to people's questions a couple of things that are odd

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:14.020
So they asked well is elementary OS getting a cut of the sales a pretty reasonable question for a laptop featuring elementary OS

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:16.400
And the quite the response at first was well

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:16.540
Yeah

01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:22.260
About two to four dollars and then and then when people ask a little bit further it turns out well it kind of depends on

01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:27.180
Bugs and we run into because we're actually doing this via the body source. Yeah

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:31.260
They're gonna do it via bug bounty the bounty source like okay, so I'm not getting a cut of each laptop

01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:35.020
You're you're just gonna use their bug bounty system if you make some profits okay, all right, okay?

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:41.700
So then it turns out well is this really elementary OS or are you modifying this no no no we're not modifying it except for

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:44.220
Well, we have updated the kernel to kernel 48

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:50.540
We've pre-installed play on Linux also King soft office and Firefox is now the default web browser, but otherwise

01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:52.260
It's stock elementary OS honestly

01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:56.420
I didn't see them saying that they didn't modify it every time I someone asked someone asked a question about

01:09:56.580 --> 01:10:01.460
Modifying it they say they give a list of everything. They've done. Oh, I was told they denied it at first, but okay

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:07.300
Yeah, there's also there's there's articles out that are reviewing it. They're acting like he deliberately ignored

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:11.300
No, he didn't it's in it's in another thread. Yeah, so you go through

01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:15.280
There's a couple of them you go through and it's you know a lot of it is just odd stuff

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:16.700
Nothing that jumps out of you

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:20.420
it's just odd stuff and you the thing is that happens with something like this is is

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:24.900
You you really have to kind of I just think of all experienced like

01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:29.340
The Kickstarter that's gone wrong or the gofundme or IndieGoGo that's gone wrong

01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:33.020
It's everybody has to goes everybody has to go total skeptical mode when they see this stuff

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:36.240
So I'm not actually I don't I don't actually want to put them down too much

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:40.660
But it does seem to me like there if anything where we are okay, though

01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:44.380
Like the stuff they keep saying like if you go to their forums though

01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:47.580
The way they're doing it is sketchy their responses

01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:52.980
They give a kind of promise and back get a best case what we what we have here is a 2014 laptop

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:57.540
That's been rebranded right and then they're they're just selling that with some support. I think it's probably

01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.980
It was probably what's happening

01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:06.300
I don't know if the laptop is like manufactured in 2014 or is it like that model was first released in 2015

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.340
I couldn't find information about that or not

01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:12.120
That's just what one of the articles said was that 2014 is from there like well, yeah

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.120
But they could have just you know reiterated it

01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:17.680
But I don't know that it's hard to tell on those will and all like Alibaba's

01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:20.180
subscriptions because they're all like

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:21.700
buzzword heavy

01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:24.060
So what was it that set off red lights for you then?

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:30.460
It wasn't it wasn't like it wasn't like a red light thing. It was just like all of this stuff together is sketchy

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.020
Like if it was one of these things I went out

01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:34.640
It's like if it was just at the Alibaba thing

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:39.140
But they're like presenting it and marketing it very well and they have a lot of information about who's running it and all this other

01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:41.260
Stuff I wouldn't care because you know

01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:44.540
Rebranding things like people do that with clevo all the time

01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:48.580
So it's not that big of a deal. So if if that's all they were doing

01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:51.460
It's just like all of these things combined feel weird

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:56.300
so like they could have just said we don't have product photos that are really genuine yet because we don't have a

01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:01.660
Photographer and we're not good all we have a camera phone and that's probably not a good way to present your products

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:03.860
You know that kind they could have done that

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:08.260
There's there's plenty of options. They could have done to make me feel

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:11.140
Not so iffy about the issue

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:15.820
But it's just like if you go to their YouTube channel, they have like weird videos that are weird

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:18.740
One of the videos is like vertical

01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:22.340
Recording with the phone vertically and

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:29.940
Then also horizontally so like they started a video vertical realized it was vertical and then turned it horizontal yet

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:34.340
The video is still vertical. So it's really awkward. Love it. I love that. Yeah

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:37.100
It's just that kind of weirdness that makes me feel weird

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:39.100
But like if I could play with a laptop

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:42.420
I would definitely do that because if they had like, you know

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:45.500
Yeah review units or something they could send that would be cool

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:49.020
But that would probably be that would be the real way to tell well, you know what?

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:52.160
I guess the other thing I would say Michael is it sort of

01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:59.220
Sort of was an indication to me the total lack of enthusiasm or plugging or hype coming from

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:02.940
Elementary OS which would seem to suggest that they're not on board with this

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:07.300
Well, I mean they definitely aren't like involved in the situation

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:11.460
so I mean, I wouldn't try to promote it if they if I didn't know about it as much either but

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:16.000
They were aware that it was happening before it was announced. So

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:20.940
They weren't like they were just denying involvement. They're not denying what they're not

01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:24.580
They don't have any assessment whether it's good or not. They're just basically staying out of the situation

01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:27.660
And I understand yeah, I understand why they're doing it

01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:32.740
But I also don't think it's a big deal that they are like it like a lot of companies aren't you know?

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:36.460
Ubuntu is not, you know advocating for specific

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:41.940
Products and stuff like that. They'll say they'll give you a list about what works and what what doesn't

01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:47.980
You're right and from a licensing standpoint you're correct

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:53.820
I would think though that if any distribution out there is going to be hypersensitive to their product being

01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:59.820
It's because look think about who's who really loses here is the customer and that sucks for elementary OS because

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:04.920
Who's gonna want something like this is gonna be an elementary OS enthusiast, but they're not actually getting elementary OS

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:09.700
They're getting something that ships a different kernel a different browser and other things that have been modified to it

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:12.500
So it's not something actually supported by the elementary OS project

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:17.780
So if they're if it's an elementary OS fan, they're actually they're getting it's a disservice and that's got to piss off

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:21.820
I would think Daniel I would think that well, I wouldn't be happy about that. It's a bit unusual

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:23.820
So there's been a few

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.520
Vendors that have shipped Ubuntu Marte on their laptops

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:29.920
most notably

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:36.240
Entroware, but a few others around Europe as well, and they've all had the courtesy to get in touch and

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:43.200
Express their intent to do this and just make sure it's okay now our

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Preferred Ubuntu Marte's preferred vendor is Entroware, but there are others. There's slimbooks and

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.680
Tuck something or other in Germany. I forget the name

01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:00.700
and they're all selling Ubuntu Marte and they're adhering to the terms of the

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:08.960
Ubuntu trademark requirements, which is they ship the vanilla image. So I could understand why

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:14.480
Elementary would feel a bit put out by having a device

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:20.040
Probably piggybacking off of elementary's brand to ship a product

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:28.360
Without actually involving them. Is this a Chinese vendor by any chance this white thing that I'm looking at on your YouTube?

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:31.320
It sounds like it sounds like yeah, you saw there

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.640
I'm sure is a Chinese company is okay. Yeah the builder

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:41.880
But the the company who is selling it as the light book and they're also rebranding it because so I'm they must have a deal

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:46.640
Because there is like, you know label like branding etched onto the laptop

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:49.640
That's in one of the videos. You can see him says alpha on the back of it

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:53.880
And that's the name of their company alpha light, but where are they based? They're in Tampa

01:15:54.680 --> 01:16:00.320
Huh, Tampa, Florida, but they haven't like that's all I could find out because it says they ship from there

01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:04.520
but I haven't found like, you know a business address or anything like that, so it's

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:08.320
It's weird. They have the elementary logo on the site, too

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:15.480
Yeah, this just feels like the same the same kind of thing that you get from any like Alibaba a Chinese vendor who

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:21.800
Just picks up a piece of software sticks it on a device and ships it out the door at the lowest possible

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:27.120
Price, so this seems this is a lot different because in the reddit AMA they did

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:33.240
people have asked a lot of different questions and every question they you know responded to was

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:38.880
You know that the responses were very promising. For example, they asked about what processor was they gave the details

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:43.920
They asked about if it's possible to get bigger RAM like pull notes. It's a you know, SD RAM type

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:50.120
They were asking like is the battery replaceable as a hard drive placeable and like they were listing about how to replace the things

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.720
Like it wasn't like they even get to the point where someone said well

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:58.600
What if I want to have a different icon set like mocha and they said put it in your order and we'll add it before

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.600
You so it's it they are

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:05.800
Very attentive in the sense of the questions that are asked and if you go to the forum, they're also very attentive to that

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:07.800
Yeah, in fact, they say here in one of the in the AMA

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:15.720
Somebody says did you make this laptop as the post claims or are you just reselling somebody else's machine with elementary OS pre-installed and

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:20.440
Lightbook team who's been answering all the questions from lightbook says we are buying it at business to business

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:26.280
Prices and then selling it with our logo engraved higher specs and on a modified version of elementary OS

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:31.480
The majority of laptops made by smaller companies are just straight-up resales just like ours

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:35.720
It's part of an OEM and then they talk about the Windows keyboard key. It's part of the OEM keyboard

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:38.840
They'd have to order a certain amount from their supplier in order not to have the Windows key on there

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:41.880
So it's yeah, it's kind of like exactly which I think they're speculating

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.320
Yeah, and they also said that someone was like well, that's unfortunate

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:49.400
You can't really code the key, but they said every laptop comes with a sticker of elementary OS on it

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:53.640
So and in a way there is a

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:58.520
So in a way there there they are addressing stuff

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.320
It's just like their marketing needs work

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:04.040
I would say that what would jump out at me?

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.600
what jumps out at me as a

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.440
Systemic problem would be

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:13.240
if your product

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:15.960
Depends on elementary OS to sell

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:21.800
It is in your best interest and longevity to work with elementary OS just like entryware works

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:26.920
With wimpy because it's in their best interest for the project to know about you and like you

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:30.760
Because they want to sell more products theoretically and so if you don't care

01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:35.240
We don't know if they contacted elementary and the elementary said no or not because yeah, you're right

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:37.320
Although i'm pretty i'm pretty much

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.880
I would be willing to make a bet that

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:43.640
Yeah, I I mean I agree with I agree with your bet

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:47.400
I'm just saying like we don't know for sure and it does feel sketchy

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:52.200
But like the responses they keep making on reddit, they still continue to respond to reddit questions

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:58.120
And on their forum you can go and leave a question and they'll you know, that's good. So that's a good answer really quickly

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:00.280
like it's it's

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:01.640
as far as like

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:07.720
You know sales uh in customer service type approach. They're very good at responding and they're very

01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:12.520
Uh open and they're not trying to pretend about like different things. They're not trying to be like, you know

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:19.480
A uh, a fake company like a fake chinese company using chinese products and just you know, pretending that it's a new thing

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:21.880
They are admitting what they're doing

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:28.360
It's just their mark the way their marketing feels really sketchy because there's like no one associated to it. There's no

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:35.880
Like there's no original photos, but they do actually show the video in gray that the laptop engraved. So it is

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:41.800
Like their claims are legitimate. They have proof of that, but it's just feels I don't know it still feels sketchy

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:45.000
I if I had a spare 250, I totally would try it

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.080
I think I also agree with the beard in the chat room

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:50.040
He says, you know, the thing is is how much of a discount could they really be getting?

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:55.640
With the expected amount of sales numbers they're going to get these are probably going to be under a thousand easily I would say

01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:59.640
But who knows but even let's just say it was five thousand. They're not going to get some sort of massive discount

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:02.280
So where is the room for profit?

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:07.160
So what that seems like they have like if you can get 150 with uh,

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:12.920
You can get a laptop those laptops at a buying a quantity of 300 you can get them for 150

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:18.680
So that's all there's another problem then because that's that's too easy. That's that's that's too easily accessible, too

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:22.200
There's this is this is not a we don't know if that's actually what they're doing

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:25.880
I just know I just saw that myself. They might actually be better for them. I don't know if they do it

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:28.760
Yeah, they say, you know, they're saying they're buying they're saying they're you know

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:32.360
They are buying business to business and getting some sort of bulk discount. That's all they've said

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:36.760
Uh, I would be wager. I'd be willing to wager if I was going to be looking at this and it's something I'd be

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:40.920
You know, this would be part of my calculus would be they're probably not going to sell tens of thousands of these things

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:46.440
So they're probably not getting some astronomical discount and they don't seem to be directly working with elementary OS

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:52.040
So they don't seem to have a clear path to profit and they don't seem to have a good relationship with the distribution

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.040
They're shipping. They're also not

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:59.160
As michael's talking about they're not really presenting a human face, right that you can become excited about yeah

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:01.480
Understand the motivation, you know, we're left to speculate

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:05.960
But here's something that I have learned over the years and this is where I kind of give them some room is

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:11.000
When you are just setting up like I go back to the purism folks when you're just getting set up with this

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:18.440
It is there is so many little things that you have to get just right for a product like this that it can take a company

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:22.520
A few times of trying this before you can actually get it

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:25.960
A few times of trying this before they really start to fire on all cylinders

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:32.920
And this could be their first foray into this area. I I know lightbook is uh, I mean, I I guess it's available now

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.400
Isn't it actually I think you can I think they say order now at least so I I guess they are shipping it

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:39.480
So it is it's a it's a product. It's gonna get out there

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:45.720
They'll have customer feedback and we'll see if they iterate on it. I I it's enough to pique my interest

01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:50.440
250 to 270 depending on your amount of storage

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:55.720
That's it. You know, that's that's enough. That's enough to kind of pique my interest and go there might be something here

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.440
that's worth to worth discussing but

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.040
It oh you can get it in black. There you go. Wes. I know how you like everything

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:06.120
Oh, really you got to get one of each got to get I mean if you're real patient

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.440
there's a there's a white there's a black and there's a

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:15.080
One that's got white base and black. I mean a red back of the led led screen

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:15.960
This is pretty great

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:24.120
You mean you could in theory you walk away with a laptop with 540 gig 40 gigabyte 544 gigs of quote-unquote hybrid storage

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:29.000
Which I assume is spinning with a on a solid little bit of solid state. No, no, no

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:35.160
It's it's two different drives one at one ms m.2 say to uh, in a ray gig ssd

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:40.520
And they're set. They're set as the they're set at dil boot. I'm, not sure how they've structured it

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:45.720
But one is they're basically they're saying hybrid approach, but it's not a hybrid drive

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:50.920
It's two different drives one ssd. That's 32 and one that's the hard drive. That's 500. Yeah, they call it hybrid storage

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.320
Okay, so that's where you get the 544 gigs

01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:58.360
Um, and so for all of that, so whatever like raid or whatever they're using to pull that off

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.440
for that

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:05.260
And a black one that's you know got a decent seller on quad core in it. Um, 283

01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:13.640
That's a pretty amazing deal and when i'm looking actually yeah, you know specs wise especially that it's a 1080

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:19.400
It's a full 1080p. Yeah, I like that. Yeah. Yeah, 1366. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And you know, it's better than a chromebook

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:25.160
Yeah as much ram as a chromebook did hey and they take bitcoin damn it

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.520
Let's just put it in danger territory

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:30.840
damn it

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.840
It's interesting, huh?

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.360
yeah, it's uh

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:39.160
Something to watch was there was someone on reddit that said that they were going to buy it to do a block a review

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:41.240
on their blog, so uh

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:46.920
Yeah, i'll i'll try to like, you know bookmark that yeah, okay do it. Yeah, maybe follow

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:48.200
I keep following it for us

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:52.120
Maybe you know because it'd be interesting to see if they actually turn this into something, you know

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:54.120
Maybe you don't actually turn this thing into a real product

01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:58.440
Maybe they'll get to the point where they'll their elementary OS project is comfortable working with them

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:03.880
And maybe they have to get to a point where they're substantial and demand the attention of elementary OS before and maybe it's who knows

01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:08.360
I don't know. They should just give me a call and i'll help them with the marketing too. There you go. There you go

01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:10.120
Find him

01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.800
He's in the mumble room

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.920
He did a fight

01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:18.200
Uh, i'm gonna give a real quick plug before we run for linux fest northwest coming up soon may 6th and 7th

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:23.960
I'll be there. Wes will be there. It's gonna be a hell of a show. I think I think right now, uh,

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.520
after after reviewing our

01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:31.320
Adventures at scale this year and kind of looking at the news that came out from scale

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:36.120
I think it's safe to say there may be a new contender for the number one linux event

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.600
in the united states

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:40.280
run by the community

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:43.880
i'm not saying it's gonna be necessarily as big as something maybe the linux foundation could put on right

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:46.280
but as far as

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:48.040
run by the community

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.040
free to freaking attend

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:54.440
With a great venue and great talks. I think we may have a new pack leader stepping up

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:59.320
This is this so I mean I am so happy i'm so happy. I mean i've scaled

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:04.120
I i'm sure they'll pull things around too. They'll they're gonna they're gonna get that live stream taken care of and that whole

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.680
Attendance thing figured out they're gonna get it pulled around

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:10.280
I believe in them, but I think this might be this might be linux fest year right here

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:17.400
2017 is the year to go. I am really looking forward to it. Noah and I are already rubbing our hands together making plans

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.480

Awesome. Thank you everybody in the Mumba Room. It was great to have both Popey and

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:21.560
Wimpy back. Nice to hear from Mr. Lunduke. Now we gotta go pick our titles. Go get your

01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:26.560
titles. And then Mr. West has got to get his business up in here. You know what I'm saying?

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:37.720
That's right. Turn on JB1. So JBtitles.com. That is bright. That reminds me of the Kodi

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:44.920
Android situation in a way. It's not exactly similar but it reminds me of that. Yes Mr.

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:49.160
Popey. Hey Chris. So a couple of things I didn't want to mention on the show but I thought

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:56.540
I'd tell you now. There was a Red Hat booth at MWC as well and loads of our guys went

01:27:56.540 --> 01:28:03.360
over there because they had some of the best coffee at MWC. That's awesome. Good on you.
