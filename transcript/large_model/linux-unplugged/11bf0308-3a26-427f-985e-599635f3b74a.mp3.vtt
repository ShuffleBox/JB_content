WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.360
Before we hit record, we were talking about Stadia,

00:02.360 --> 00:05.220
and what a disappointment it has turned into.

00:05.220 --> 00:07.300
And I already regret buying my,

00:07.300 --> 00:09.100
I think they called it Founder's Bundle

00:09.100 --> 00:10.100
or something like that.

00:10.100 --> 00:11.340
Yeah, they got you suckered in.

00:11.340 --> 00:14.020
I mean, I had fun playing it here at the studio,

00:14.020 --> 00:16.860
but I haven't heard you mention it since then.

00:16.860 --> 00:18.900
No, I pretty much stopped using it a couple of weeks

00:18.900 --> 00:19.740
after I got it.

00:19.740 --> 00:20.980
So I logged back in this morning,

00:20.980 --> 00:24.340
and I now am the proud owner of one pay game.

00:24.340 --> 00:26.300
I bought that early on, Red Dead Redemption,

00:26.300 --> 00:28.700
for like $100.

00:28.700 --> 00:29.900
But you gotta play something.

00:29.900 --> 00:33.740
And then I got Metro Exodus now for free.

00:33.740 --> 00:35.380
I don't know, where do they go wrong, guys?

00:35.380 --> 00:36.580
Is it the price of the games?

00:36.580 --> 00:37.460
Is it a lack of games?

00:37.460 --> 00:38.620
Is it all of the above?

00:38.620 --> 00:40.500
I think it's the fact that you don't get a refund

00:40.500 --> 00:43.020
whenever they close the system down.

00:43.020 --> 00:45.940
Ha ha ha ha, when they inevitably shut it down.

00:45.940 --> 00:48.060
People are just too familiar with Google.

00:48.060 --> 00:50.840
Google got the track record, so yeah.

00:50.840 --> 00:52.420
I think it's a bit late as well.

00:52.420 --> 00:56.620
I mean, I appreciate that the whole streaming services,

00:56.620 --> 00:58.660
now is the time for streaming services.

00:58.660 --> 01:01.980
Like, we've got Netflix, we've got Spotify.

01:01.980 --> 01:04.880
We understand the whole streaming technology.

01:04.880 --> 01:09.500
But everyone's already got their game system set up,

01:09.500 --> 01:11.780
and they've got their Steam account,

01:11.780 --> 01:15.060
and they've got their itch.io for indie games,

01:15.060 --> 01:19.480
and all those other stores that nobody cares about.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.900
I think it feels too late.

01:21.900 --> 01:24.460
It feels like people already bought

01:24.460 --> 01:26.180
into all the other platforms.

01:26.180 --> 01:27.300
Yeah, there's that.

01:27.300 --> 01:29.220
And but, to what Cheese was saying,

01:29.220 --> 01:31.820
I just read an article where the journalist went around

01:31.820 --> 01:35.860
and interviewed Stadia players, and he did not prompt them.

01:35.860 --> 01:38.180
But almost all of them said they were concerned Google

01:38.180 --> 01:39.620
would shut it down eventually.

01:39.620 --> 01:41.100
That's become Google's brand.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.820
And then, of course, you combine the fact

01:42.820 --> 01:44.520
that you need a pretty decent connection.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.940
When I want to play video games, I'm at home,

01:46.940 --> 01:48.980
and I don't have a great connection at home.

01:48.980 --> 01:50.360
I have a good connection at work,

01:50.360 --> 01:52.420
but I'm not playing video games at work.

01:52.420 --> 01:54.640
So you combine all these things, the game prices,

01:54.640 --> 01:58.620
the fear of them shutting it down, internet connections.

01:58.620 --> 02:01.060
It just doesn't seem like Google's going to pull it off.

02:01.060 --> 02:03.540
We'll see if the next thing happens.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.500
I mean, who knows?

02:04.500 --> 02:05.200
Maybe they'll keep it going.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.500
People are putting a lot of money into this.

02:06.500 --> 02:07.960
They kind of have to stick with it.

02:07.960 --> 02:16.100
Hello, friends.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.100
Welcome into your weekly Linux talk show

02:18.100 --> 02:19.900
that makes its own Super Tuesday.

02:19.900 --> 02:20.580
My name is Chris.

02:20.580 --> 02:21.340
My name is Wes.

02:21.340 --> 02:22.460
Hello, Wes.

02:22.460 --> 02:25.220
Nice to be podcasting with you for 3.43.

02:25.220 --> 02:27.420
Yes, I'm casting my vote for Linux Unplugged.

02:27.420 --> 02:29.560
We have a lot to cover this week.

02:29.560 --> 02:32.940
We have a big one to get into, a little real talk

02:32.940 --> 02:34.520
for the community this week, something

02:34.520 --> 02:36.880
that has been brewing behind the scenes

02:36.880 --> 02:39.300
in various different conversations for a while.

02:39.300 --> 02:44.340
And it starts when I tried using a MacBook at home

02:44.340 --> 02:45.340
for about a month.

02:45.340 --> 02:46.340
What?

02:46.340 --> 02:48.860
And I came away with a couple of interesting notes

02:48.860 --> 02:51.060
that I want to share with the audience, observations,

02:51.060 --> 02:54.300
and where I think the Mac gets it right, where they get it

02:54.300 --> 02:58.380
wrong, and why, ultimately, Linux is the long game.

02:58.380 --> 02:59.180
I still think that.

02:59.180 --> 03:03.100
But in this endeavor, I had to give the Mac a real fair shake.

03:03.100 --> 03:07.260
I challenged myself to try to treat this as intellectually

03:07.260 --> 03:08.220
honest as I could.

03:08.220 --> 03:10.420
At first, whenever I've used the Mac, I've always

03:10.420 --> 03:13.420
kind of had this visceral kind of don't like using it.

03:13.420 --> 03:15.420
It's just like all these rough edges response.

03:15.420 --> 03:16.780
And it's a different paradigm.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.500
Yeah, so this time I said to myself, all right, all right.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.620
But what if you gave it a day like you give plasma?

03:22.620 --> 03:23.900
You give plasma a whole day.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.900
What if you gave this a whole day?

03:25.900 --> 03:27.860
Would it be so bad then if you took a day?

03:27.860 --> 03:29.400
So I'll tell you a little bit about that

03:29.400 --> 03:31.020
and what I realized in that process.

03:31.020 --> 03:32.180
But we have a bunch of community news

03:32.180 --> 03:33.260
to get to as well as some pics.

03:33.260 --> 03:34.820
But before we go any further, I've

03:34.820 --> 03:36.980
got to say in the morning to Cheese, hello, Cheese.

03:36.980 --> 03:37.940
Hey, guys.

03:37.940 --> 03:38.740
How's it going?

03:38.740 --> 03:39.180
Hey, buddy.

03:39.180 --> 03:41.000
And then, of course, time appropriate greetings,

03:41.000 --> 03:41.700
Mumble Room.

03:41.700 --> 03:42.200
Hello.

03:42.200 --> 03:42.700
Hello.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.540
Good evening.

03:43.540 --> 03:44.040
Howdy.

03:44.040 --> 03:44.660
Hello.

03:44.660 --> 03:45.260
Hi.

03:45.260 --> 03:46.060
Hi.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.420
Well, I hear a poppy in there.

03:47.420 --> 03:48.340
Hello, poppy.

03:48.340 --> 03:49.100
Well, hello there.

03:49.100 --> 03:49.780
How are you?

03:49.780 --> 03:50.380
Well, hello.

03:50.380 --> 03:51.380
I'm good.

03:51.380 --> 03:52.100
I'm quite well.

03:52.100 --> 03:53.740
It's nice to see everybody in there.

03:53.740 --> 03:55.060
A great turnout again.

03:55.060 --> 03:57.580
I see Ace Nomad, Brent, and Byte, and Carl, and Colonel,

03:57.580 --> 03:58.620
and Mini Mac, and Poppy.

03:58.620 --> 04:01.580
And is it Stewn?

04:01.580 --> 04:02.540
How do you say that?

04:02.540 --> 04:03.460
Is it Stun?

04:03.460 --> 04:04.300
Stewin?

04:04.300 --> 04:05.660
Stewin, yeah.

04:05.660 --> 04:06.700
That's about it.

04:06.700 --> 04:07.780
Oh, welcome, Stewin.

04:07.780 --> 04:10.860
I like that you're kind of iffy on that.

04:10.860 --> 04:12.380
In Dutch, it's Stun.

04:12.380 --> 04:13.380
Ah, OK.

04:13.380 --> 04:13.860
All right.

04:13.860 --> 04:14.380
OK.

04:14.380 --> 04:15.780
I see what you're rolling with.

04:15.780 --> 04:19.060
Well, let's talk about some things that are coming down.

04:19.060 --> 04:21.340
The distribution pipeline, very soon.

04:21.340 --> 04:24.100
If you're going to grab Ubuntu 20.04 when it comes out,

04:24.100 --> 04:26.940
or one of the modern distros that ships Gnome Shell,

04:26.940 --> 04:29.700
then you're likely going to end up with Gnome 3.36.

04:29.700 --> 04:30.300
Right?

04:30.300 --> 04:33.340
That's what comes in the focal.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.660
Poppy's been getting me kind of tempted to actually start

04:35.660 --> 04:36.920
running it as my daily driver.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.260
You're not already?

04:38.260 --> 04:39.900
I downloaded it last night.

04:39.900 --> 04:40.900
So I might.

04:40.900 --> 04:41.940
I just, I don't know.

04:41.940 --> 04:43.420
I've been really happy with Manjaro.

04:43.420 --> 04:46.660
But I think I want to wipe it and go with 20.04

04:46.660 --> 04:48.740
just to use it for a bit before the release

04:48.740 --> 04:50.620
and have some hands-on.

04:50.620 --> 04:54.260
But there's some nice things landing in 3.36 of Gnome Shell.

04:54.260 --> 04:58.300
A bunch of fixes, a bunch of performance improvements.

04:58.300 --> 05:00.300
And these changes are landing just kind of in time

05:00.300 --> 05:01.860
because it's going into code freeze.

05:01.860 --> 05:03.260
It's going to be all done.

05:03.260 --> 05:06.780
So whenever it does land, in whatever distribution you use,

05:06.780 --> 05:08.500
there'll be some things to look out for.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.420
There are improvements to the CSS engine.

05:10.420 --> 05:12.300
But there's also a batch of cleanups

05:12.300 --> 05:14.580
and refactoring to how it handles files

05:14.580 --> 05:16.980
in general for the SCSS.

05:16.980 --> 05:19.540
And Gnome Shell also now is avoiding certain I.O.

05:19.540 --> 05:23.580
operations in the main thread, which saves on disk I.O.

05:23.580 --> 05:27.100
And this is a cute one, but it's a nice fix.

05:27.100 --> 05:29.160
The local time zone is now cached,

05:29.160 --> 05:32.220
which will avoid reading the contents of Etsy local time

05:32.220 --> 05:33.460
more than necessary.

05:33.460 --> 05:36.620
But as a consequence of that, Gnome Shell

05:36.620 --> 05:39.900
actually behaves a lot better under heavy I.O. loads.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.860
Animations also are now disabled under various circumstances,

05:42.860 --> 05:46.060
such as if Gnome Shell is using a software render,

05:46.060 --> 05:48.620
or if you're sharing your screen with VNC,

05:48.620 --> 05:50.260
it turns off the animations.

05:50.260 --> 05:51.220
That's so smart.

05:51.220 --> 05:52.420
It's nice, huh?

05:52.420 --> 05:55.860
And also, it officially is now shipping that extensions

05:55.860 --> 05:58.060
management app that we talked about once before that allows

05:58.060 --> 06:00.140
you to globally disable extensions,

06:00.140 --> 06:02.860
sort of takes that functionality out of Gnome Tweak

06:02.860 --> 06:06.940
and puts it in an actual Gnome Shell official application

06:06.940 --> 06:08.860
where users can look at their extension status,

06:08.860 --> 06:10.980
toggle them on or off, and things like that.

06:10.980 --> 06:13.300
Might be small, but it feels pretty big there.

06:13.300 --> 06:15.700
Yeah, I will use the crap out of that.

06:15.700 --> 06:18.060
Now, of course, Mudder hasn't been left out.

06:18.060 --> 06:19.700
Lots of good improvements there,

06:19.700 --> 06:22.260
including improved screencasting support.

06:22.260 --> 06:24.060
And this part caught my eye.

06:24.060 --> 06:28.020
The screencast engine is now implemented on top of PipeWire

06:28.020 --> 06:30.100
and exports a PipeWire node that can be read and consumed

06:30.100 --> 06:31.300
by other applications.

06:31.300 --> 06:33.740
So now you've got that nice jack-like ability

06:33.740 --> 06:36.180
in the PipeWire graph to go connect things up.

06:36.180 --> 06:39.260
Intel now also, this API would download the contents

06:39.260 --> 06:41.220
of the monitor frame buffers from the GPU

06:41.220 --> 06:43.820
to the system memory, and then pass it to PipeWire.

06:43.820 --> 06:47.060
After that, but that was obviously highly inefficient,

06:47.060 --> 06:48.060
and that's been improved.

06:48.060 --> 06:48.980
That's cool.

06:48.980 --> 06:51.260
So that means doing screencast and stuff like that,

06:51.260 --> 06:54.420
but less of a load on your GPU and on your CPU.

06:54.420 --> 06:55.260
Exactly.

06:55.260 --> 06:56.140
That's a great improvement.

06:56.140 --> 06:58.860
And using PipeWire behind the scenes to do that.

06:58.860 --> 07:01.980
And also, back in February, a major change came in

07:01.980 --> 07:04.620
on how Mudder handles drawing monitors.

07:04.620 --> 07:06.180
This is the first step towards achieving a goal

07:06.180 --> 07:09.260
of one frame clock per monitor.

07:09.260 --> 07:10.940
And that's a nice architectural change

07:10.940 --> 07:13.780
that should eventually translate to real usability wins.

07:13.780 --> 07:16.100
Yeah, a lot of rendering improvements in general,

07:16.100 --> 07:18.180
cutting down on just unnecessary rendering

07:18.180 --> 07:19.460
in different scenarios.

07:19.460 --> 07:22.060
And even improvements in how the wallpaper is handled,

07:22.060 --> 07:23.740
which allows Mudder to save resources

07:23.740 --> 07:25.700
when scaling is applied to a monitor.

07:25.700 --> 07:28.020
And then of course, various fixes

07:28.020 --> 07:29.860
for Wayland support have landed.

07:29.860 --> 07:31.780
Small memory leaks were plugged.

07:31.780 --> 07:34.380
And Mudder now avoids flickering on X11

07:34.380 --> 07:36.300
when you're using an, when windows are switching

07:36.300 --> 07:37.780
between undirected or not.

07:37.780 --> 07:42.780
GNOME 3.36, looking really, really good.

07:43.820 --> 07:45.820
Plasma, looking really, really good.

07:45.820 --> 07:47.580
Like things are getting in shape.

07:47.580 --> 07:49.020
I can't help when we talk about GNOME

07:49.020 --> 07:50.620
to think back a little bit to,

07:50.620 --> 07:52.420
you know, when we express some of our concerns

07:52.420 --> 07:53.940
about the underlying architecture

07:53.940 --> 07:55.940
and just the amount of work it would take

07:55.940 --> 07:57.900
to sort of get on really solid footing.

07:57.900 --> 08:00.060
But I think we're past that.

08:00.060 --> 08:02.940
I mean, the pace of development, the changes,

08:02.940 --> 08:07.340
the improvements deep down in how Mudder works,

08:07.340 --> 08:08.540
those are all coming in.

08:08.540 --> 08:12.340
This to me seems like a clear long-term knock-on effect

08:12.340 --> 08:15.140
of Canonical putting Ubuntu behind GNOME Shell.

08:16.300 --> 08:17.980
And they've done a big portion of a lot of this work,

08:17.980 --> 08:20.500
but even just that, it's inspired others

08:20.500 --> 08:22.180
to pick up the work there.

08:23.380 --> 08:27.820
It really has gotten to a much, much, much better place.

08:27.820 --> 08:28.980
It's just about time to throw it all out

08:28.980 --> 08:30.460
and start over, isn't it, Popey?

08:30.460 --> 08:32.020
Oh, I don't know about that.

08:32.020 --> 08:34.180
2004 is gonna be around for a long time.

08:34.180 --> 08:37.260
So, you know, you can install 2004 in April

08:37.260 --> 08:39.260
and be confident that you're gonna keep getting updates

08:39.260 --> 08:41.260
for five, maybe 10 years.

08:41.260 --> 08:42.300
Yeah, good answer.

08:42.300 --> 08:43.700
Dang it, dang it.

08:44.660 --> 08:47.620
Also, just bringing the slow, eventual,

08:47.620 --> 08:52.140
no big deal, low-key arrival of Wayland's Firefox 75,

08:52.140 --> 08:55.140
which is due to be released next month,

08:55.140 --> 08:57.260
should have its native Wayland support

08:57.260 --> 08:58.860
in really good order now.

08:58.860 --> 09:03.100
Yeah, merged yesterday as we record this

09:03.100 --> 09:04.780
with the Firefox Wayland patches

09:04.780 --> 09:08.380
for VA API video acceleration support in conjunction

09:08.380 --> 09:10.100
with FFmpeg.

09:10.100 --> 09:12.700
Support does require enabling OpenGL

09:12.700 --> 09:14.780
or web render within Firefox,

09:14.780 --> 09:19.220
as well as setting the Wayland DMA buff VA API control knobs.

09:19.220 --> 09:21.300
And if you don't know what that is,

09:21.300 --> 09:22.140
I didn't really either,

09:22.140 --> 09:23.500
but we'll have links in the show notes.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.060
A control knob, huh?

09:25.060 --> 09:27.580
I imagine that's just in the Firefox about config settings,

09:27.580 --> 09:28.740
but I could be wrong.

09:28.740 --> 09:29.780
I like it.

09:29.780 --> 09:31.980
I like the terminology there for some reason.

09:31.980 --> 09:33.340
I think it's kind of funny.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.060
Cool to see it.

09:35.060 --> 09:36.380
And like I say, it's sort of this,

09:36.380 --> 09:39.140
just this low-key, slow arrival of Wayland.

09:39.140 --> 09:40.380
Right. It would be no big deal.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.220
More fundamentals.

09:41.220 --> 09:43.460
And I think too, maybe what we'll talk a little bit more

09:43.460 --> 09:45.180
with your experiences on the Mac,

09:45.180 --> 09:47.660
it is these sorts of video acceleration niceties

09:47.660 --> 09:50.460
that you just sort of expect on the modern desktop.

09:50.460 --> 09:51.940
Yeah, fair enough.

09:51.940 --> 09:53.660
You're, look at you teasing.

09:53.660 --> 09:54.500
Well, before we get there,

09:54.500 --> 09:57.020
how about a little housekeeping?

09:57.020 --> 09:59.260
Don't forget about the daylight savings monster.

09:59.260 --> 10:01.100
It arrives this Sunday here in the States.

10:01.100 --> 10:01.940
Oh no, again?

10:01.940 --> 10:03.060
I know.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.860
Imagine the time math we do with working with folks

10:05.860 --> 10:09.500
in both London, but also in Australia.

10:09.500 --> 10:13.380
And then of course, all the time zones in the United States.

10:13.380 --> 10:17.900
So, can we please just knock this crap off?

10:17.900 --> 10:19.780
Right, UTC, let's be done with it.

10:19.780 --> 10:21.100
I'm good.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.260
I can do it. Let's go.

10:22.260 --> 10:24.540
I'm fine with that, being on UTC,

10:24.540 --> 10:26.020
given that's what we're on right now.

10:26.020 --> 10:26.860
I know.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.620
Even with that, making Popey and Joe happy, I'll tolerate.

10:29.620 --> 10:32.060
Yeah, I mean, that's a compromise we all have to make.

10:32.060 --> 10:34.020
Absolutely, it's worth it.

10:34.020 --> 10:36.180
I wanna give a plug while we're talking about Joe.

10:36.180 --> 10:39.500
Fosthawk Live, June 20th at the Harrison,

10:39.500 --> 10:41.620
which as you know, is near King's Cross in London.

10:41.620 --> 10:42.740
Of course.

10:42.740 --> 10:47.340
I believe tickets are $1,000 each.

10:47.340 --> 10:49.580
And your first, what's that?

10:49.580 --> 10:50.700
No, that's not true.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.100
Oh, okay, all right.

10:52.100 --> 10:54.780
Well, you can get the details at fosthawk.com.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.260
We'll have a link in the show notes.

10:56.260 --> 10:57.940
Tickets are free.

10:57.940 --> 10:59.860
Donations are welcome though.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.140
So maybe put like $1,000 in that donation box.

11:02.140 --> 11:03.140
That's probably one of those events

11:03.140 --> 11:05.060
I would just love to make it to.

11:05.060 --> 11:05.900
I know.

11:05.900 --> 11:06.740
Someday.

11:06.740 --> 11:07.860
Oh my God, it's so good.

11:07.860 --> 11:08.700
It's so good.

11:08.700 --> 11:09.980
It's so cozy.

11:09.980 --> 11:13.420
You're in the basement of a pub, a proper pub,

11:13.420 --> 11:16.740
and it's really dark and dingy down there.

11:16.740 --> 11:19.940
And you've got uncomfortable small chairs

11:19.940 --> 11:21.540
and that's what makes it awesome

11:21.540 --> 11:26.020
because you're all a bunch of nerds, super cozy.

11:26.020 --> 11:27.700
Joe pointed out the other day

11:27.700 --> 11:31.220
that most of the people who bought a ticket,

11:31.220 --> 11:33.620
or I say buy, have obtained a ticket,

11:34.780 --> 11:36.020
have bought one ticket.

11:36.020 --> 11:37.740
So most people go on their own

11:37.740 --> 11:40.340
and people do worry about whether they're gonna fit in

11:40.340 --> 11:42.340
and whether they're gonna have people to talk to.

11:42.340 --> 11:43.220
Everyone will fit in.

11:43.220 --> 11:44.580
Everyone will have someone to talk to.

11:44.580 --> 11:45.620
It's a fantastic event.

11:45.620 --> 11:47.900
I highly recommend people go if they can.

11:47.900 --> 11:51.780
And there's social lubrication to go all around.

11:51.780 --> 11:52.620
I would love to go.

11:52.620 --> 11:53.780
I was gonna totally go,

11:53.780 --> 11:54.980
but then Wes wouldn't let me go

11:54.980 --> 11:56.500
because of the whole COVID-19 thing.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.220
Just worry about you in the show.

11:58.220 --> 12:01.020
Well, all right, so that's plenty.

12:01.020 --> 12:03.060
We've probably gone a little too long there.

12:03.060 --> 12:04.020
So more links.

12:04.020 --> 12:05.460
There's additional things in the show notes,

12:05.460 --> 12:10.300
but I wanna talk about Linux being a general purpose OS

12:10.300 --> 12:14.100
for very specific things.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.020
Think about that statement for a second.

12:16.020 --> 12:17.140
A general purpose OS

12:17.140 --> 12:19.380
that can be used for very specific things.

12:19.380 --> 12:21.900
And while we're talking again about Joe,

12:21.900 --> 12:24.140
go check out episode 84,

12:24.140 --> 12:28.660
where they covered this in a slightly different track.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.460
This has been a wider conversation

12:30.460 --> 12:34.700
that we've been having privately amongst ourselves

12:34.700 --> 12:37.820
and with friends and other people.

12:37.820 --> 12:39.740
And they really kind of encapsulated the conversation

12:39.740 --> 12:42.580
really good in episode 84 of Late Night Linux.

12:42.580 --> 12:44.780
And really the idea there was,

12:44.780 --> 12:47.220
is it time to focus on open source applications

12:47.220 --> 12:49.740
and not so much on the desktop?

12:50.620 --> 12:52.460
I don't buy that argument.

12:52.460 --> 12:55.140
I think the desktop has a very bright future.

12:55.140 --> 12:57.900
And in fact, I think Linux is better positioned

12:57.900 --> 13:00.500
for that long-term for certain use cases

13:00.500 --> 13:02.020
than any other platform.

13:02.020 --> 13:03.380
And I think we'll get there.

13:04.780 --> 13:08.940
But with that statement also, there's a flip side to it.

13:08.940 --> 13:12.900
And that is, there are legitimately use cases

13:12.900 --> 13:14.660
that it is not well-suited for.

13:14.660 --> 13:16.620
We gotta be honest about that.

13:16.620 --> 13:19.100
Based on just market dynamics and realities

13:19.100 --> 13:20.660
and the way economics work,

13:20.660 --> 13:23.260
the way it all just has shaken out, it's just the truth.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.100
It's just-

13:24.100 --> 13:26.860
And the expectations of regular users.

13:26.860 --> 13:28.060
Yeah.

13:28.060 --> 13:33.060
When I look at Linux, I look at it as a platform really

13:33.260 --> 13:34.900
that is used on servers,

13:34.900 --> 13:38.820
but also is almost a runtime these days

13:38.820 --> 13:41.900
with WSL on Windows

13:41.900 --> 13:46.020
and really kind of a universal kind of,

13:46.020 --> 13:47.820
just everybody's writing applications

13:47.820 --> 13:49.260
to run it on Linux in these containers.

13:49.260 --> 13:51.180
And if they do that, it'll run on any platform.

13:51.180 --> 13:53.300
You can run Docker containers on Windows 10

13:53.300 --> 13:55.100
through WSL2 now.

13:55.100 --> 13:55.940
This is something that,

13:55.940 --> 13:59.020
and they've got Docker desktop that they're working on,

13:59.020 --> 14:02.260
including, I watched a YouTube video this morning

14:02.260 --> 14:07.260
of a YouTuber who is using XFCE from inside WSL2.

14:08.740 --> 14:09.820
That's fantastic.

14:09.820 --> 14:10.820
It's pretty crazy.

14:11.660 --> 14:13.940
Of course, Docker's available for the Mac.

14:13.940 --> 14:17.900
You can run Docker on a free NAS server, which is BSD.

14:17.900 --> 14:21.460
So there's the runtime Linux, there's the server Linux,

14:21.460 --> 14:25.860
there's the embedded OS Linux, there's desktop Linux.

14:27.740 --> 14:30.180
Now, open source has clearly been successful.

14:30.180 --> 14:32.620
There's a lot of really massive applications out there

14:32.620 --> 14:34.740
like VLC and Firefox and Blender

14:34.740 --> 14:39.260
and lots of desktop applications that are very successful.

14:40.700 --> 14:42.580
But there's not many distributions of Linux

14:42.580 --> 14:44.700
or desktop environments that are as successful

14:44.700 --> 14:46.380
as some of those applications are.

14:46.380 --> 14:51.380
And I think as time goes on, this will shift.

14:51.380 --> 14:54.780
But today in 2020, there's still a very valid case

14:54.780 --> 14:57.060
for a specialist OS.

14:57.060 --> 15:00.220
Remember, I said Linux is a generalist OS

15:00.220 --> 15:02.860
that can be used for specific purposes,

15:02.860 --> 15:04.940
like embedded devices is always a go-to.

15:06.260 --> 15:09.820
But then you have specialist OS

15:09.820 --> 15:11.860
that are made by commercial vendors

15:11.860 --> 15:15.260
that really serve one master purpose.

15:15.260 --> 15:17.660
And this is the train of thinking I started to get down

15:17.660 --> 15:19.860
when I started using this MacBook at home.

15:19.860 --> 15:22.700
I had this 2017 TouchBar MacBook,

15:23.860 --> 15:26.260
and it's not getting used for anything.

15:26.260 --> 15:29.540
Ultimately, I just enjoy technology, whatever it might be.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.900
That's a nice piece of hardware.

15:31.900 --> 15:35.460
And so I thought, all right, well, let's try.

15:35.460 --> 15:36.660
Let's try, I was kind of inspired

15:36.660 --> 15:38.540
by something Alex and I have been talking about.

15:38.540 --> 15:39.860
Let's try when I go home

15:39.860 --> 15:42.340
using a totally different computing paradigm

15:42.340 --> 15:46.260
to get a broader sense of at work and at home,

15:46.260 --> 15:48.340
because then I could have all of my work stuff

15:48.340 --> 15:51.940
on the ThinkPad, and when I'm at work, I'm on the ThinkPad,

15:51.940 --> 15:54.420
and when I'm at home, I'm on the MacBook.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.340
It's a totally just like jarring different-

15:56.340 --> 15:57.980
Very clear indication of your switch.

15:57.980 --> 15:59.220
Immediately hated it,

15:59.220 --> 16:01.460
as every time I sit down to use Mac OS,

16:01.460 --> 16:02.300
I just can't stand it.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.620
It's a pretty fun environment at this point.

16:04.620 --> 16:07.100
It's like a hundred small little things.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.260
Like the trackpad's great,

16:08.260 --> 16:10.740
but natural scrolling is turned on by default.

16:10.740 --> 16:12.700
Like there's just, everything has a little bit

16:12.700 --> 16:16.100
of a rough edge for me that I have to go finesse.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.060
And I always would get sort of frustrated

16:18.060 --> 16:20.060
and be like, I'm not doing this.

16:20.060 --> 16:21.980
This is a $2,000 computer.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.860
I shouldn't have to bother with this, right?

16:23.860 --> 16:27.100
But yet I have no problem setting up a brand new laptop

16:27.100 --> 16:30.220
or a Dell XPS or a custom-built PC

16:30.220 --> 16:31.740
with plasma or GNOME Shell

16:31.740 --> 16:34.540
and spending a day or two tinkering

16:34.540 --> 16:36.020
to get it to just the way I want.

16:36.020 --> 16:38.380
And I can cut that down, especially on GNOME Shell,

16:38.380 --> 16:39.620
but like with plasma,

16:39.620 --> 16:40.900
it usually takes me a couple of days

16:40.900 --> 16:42.900
because I kind of fix it as I go along.

16:42.900 --> 16:43.900
Right, you realize, oh yeah,

16:43.900 --> 16:45.900
I do wanna tweak this setting.

16:45.900 --> 16:48.380
So I said, okay, well, if I'm gonna be honest here,

16:48.380 --> 16:50.420
I have to afford the same allowance for the Mac.

16:50.420 --> 16:52.860
I can't judge it because I don't judge plasma

16:52.860 --> 16:54.220
without modifying those things.

16:54.220 --> 16:56.060
I don't judge GNOME Shell.

16:56.060 --> 16:58.220
So I need to give the same allowances for the Mac.

16:58.220 --> 17:00.740
And you gotta reach that everyday use steady state

17:00.740 --> 17:03.620
that is really what it would be like to use it.

17:03.620 --> 17:04.660
I will make just a side note.

17:04.660 --> 17:06.460
The keyboard is atrocious.

17:07.580 --> 17:08.620
It's really bad.

17:08.620 --> 17:10.420
This is one of the butterfly?

17:10.420 --> 17:12.340
Yeah, it's really, really bad.

17:12.340 --> 17:13.540
And that's one of the reasons I quit using it.

17:13.540 --> 17:15.460
Plus we just didn't really have,

17:15.460 --> 17:17.100
we didn't need a Mac in production anymore.

17:17.100 --> 17:20.260
So it's like when the company sale came,

17:20.260 --> 17:21.500
I was like, ah, we don't use this.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.820
I'll just keep this.

17:22.820 --> 17:24.420
We don't use it for anything with production stuff.

17:24.420 --> 17:26.300
Like I had to make a hard decision there.

17:26.300 --> 17:29.740
And so it just sat being unused with the battery dying.

17:29.740 --> 17:30.900
And that like just kills me.

17:30.900 --> 17:31.980
Just sit there looking at it, you know,

17:31.980 --> 17:32.820
and I feel guilty.

17:32.820 --> 17:33.660
Money slowly wasting away.

17:33.660 --> 17:36.140
So every now and then I plug it in with a USB-C cord

17:36.140 --> 17:36.980
and then like unplug it.

17:36.980 --> 17:38.900
And then like a month later, plug it back.

17:38.900 --> 17:40.860
Like I just, I was neglecting it.

17:40.860 --> 17:44.580
And so I thought, okay, well, I'll set up a $50 budget

17:44.580 --> 17:46.460
because on the Mac, you gotta pay for everything.

17:46.460 --> 17:48.460
Everything costs money.

17:48.460 --> 17:50.380
You want window snapping, it costs money.

17:50.380 --> 17:52.740
You wanna fancy something up, it costs money.

17:52.740 --> 17:55.860
You want system meters in your menu bar, it costs money.

17:55.860 --> 17:57.900
You wanna manage what icons are in your menu bar,

17:57.900 --> 17:58.860
it costs money.

17:58.860 --> 18:02.100
So I set up myself a $50 budget

18:02.100 --> 18:04.020
and I have not spent all $50.

18:04.020 --> 18:05.420
And within a day or two,

18:05.420 --> 18:09.220
I think I had it as usable as I would probably say,

18:09.220 --> 18:10.060
Gnome Shell.

18:10.060 --> 18:11.100
That's really interesting too,

18:11.100 --> 18:13.460
because I think at least on, you know,

18:13.460 --> 18:14.700
when I'm used to the Linux desktop,

18:14.700 --> 18:17.100
that seems like a really big philosophical period

18:17.100 --> 18:19.460
that just that I couldn't expect those features

18:19.460 --> 18:20.700
without having to pay for it.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.500
But when you frame it with a very reasonable,

18:22.500 --> 18:24.940
I mean, $50, especially if you're gonna invest in tools,

18:24.940 --> 18:28.620
maybe one time or yearly, that's so reasonable.

18:28.620 --> 18:30.340
It feels dumb to pay for something

18:30.340 --> 18:33.380
to help me tile a window or snap a window.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.420
But if I just say, all right,

18:34.420 --> 18:35.500
I'm not gonna spend more than 50 bucks.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.020
It was, they are good apps.

18:38.020 --> 18:40.540
They are probably the best apps at doing that.

18:40.540 --> 18:43.500
Like the one that is really fricking impressive

18:43.500 --> 18:45.460
that I got is called iStat Menus.

18:45.460 --> 18:46.620
This is one of the more expensive ones.

18:46.620 --> 18:49.460
And some of these now want subscriptions, which is cute,

18:50.340 --> 18:53.300
which is really cute, but it's menus,

18:53.300 --> 18:55.060
it's menu meters up in the menu bar.

18:55.060 --> 18:57.580
And it is, I mean, it's really good.

18:57.580 --> 18:59.780
Like it's worth 30 bucks or it was 19 bucks.

18:59.780 --> 19:01.340
It was worth it.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.620
Really, I would buy it again.

19:02.620 --> 19:04.500
I would buy it for Linux in a heartbeat.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.460
And you have some insurance that, you know,

19:05.460 --> 19:06.580
that's money going to the developer

19:06.580 --> 19:07.780
to continue to develop it.

19:07.780 --> 19:11.260
And of course on the Mac, you have the one platform.

19:11.260 --> 19:12.900
So you're never gonna switch away

19:12.900 --> 19:14.180
from the Mac OS environment

19:14.180 --> 19:16.100
and not be able to use this anymore.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.300
Just gonna keep working.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.140
That is true.

19:18.140 --> 19:19.220
Yeah, because if I'd bought something

19:19.220 --> 19:20.620
that only worked with GNOME Shell,

19:20.620 --> 19:21.460
wouldn't necessarily-

19:21.460 --> 19:23.460
Maybe they have a Plasma, but maybe not.

19:23.460 --> 19:25.980
Hmm, yeah, I hadn't thought of that.

19:25.980 --> 19:27.780
I generally don't need to do it on those desktops.

19:27.780 --> 19:29.780
Like Plasma has everything built in I need.

19:29.780 --> 19:32.420
I just have to turn it on and learn how to configure it.

19:32.420 --> 19:34.620
So once I got past this hurdle though,

19:34.620 --> 19:36.780
I could appreciate a few things

19:36.780 --> 19:40.380
that I think the Mac gets right.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.980
In part, I started to notice things

19:42.980 --> 19:45.260
that Linux can't really do,

19:45.260 --> 19:47.340
that they can do on the Mac.

19:47.340 --> 19:50.460
And that is they build Mac OS

19:50.460 --> 19:53.020
with the intention of their pro apps being used

19:53.020 --> 19:55.980
on the platform, like Logic and Final Cut.

19:55.980 --> 19:59.140
What that means is the systems work together

19:59.140 --> 20:01.460
in unique moments of stress,

20:01.460 --> 20:03.140
probably in a way Linux never can.

20:03.140 --> 20:05.460
Like the kernel team is working

20:05.460 --> 20:07.500
with the audio subsystem team,

20:07.500 --> 20:09.780
who's working with the video subsystem team

20:09.780 --> 20:12.380
to make sure that things remain responsive

20:12.380 --> 20:15.140
when the system's under serious pressure.

20:15.140 --> 20:18.740
And really what got me started on this whole journey

20:18.740 --> 20:20.140
was I wanted to see what would happen

20:20.140 --> 20:22.140
if I hooked up my eGPU to the MacBook.

20:22.140 --> 20:24.820
Like what does Mac OS catalyze do?

20:24.820 --> 20:26.540
I mean, you've been pretty into eGPU,

20:26.540 --> 20:27.380
so that makes sense.

20:27.380 --> 20:29.060
And my first experiences with this

20:29.060 --> 20:30.860
were documented in the Chris Lastcast,

20:30.860 --> 20:33.700
where it was called like the Max Vista moment,

20:33.700 --> 20:36.460
because Catalina is a rough turd.

20:36.460 --> 20:39.260
Let me tell you, it is a rough rider,

20:39.260 --> 20:43.620
and it is UAC all up in your face constantly.

20:43.620 --> 20:45.100
It's worse than Vista.

20:45.100 --> 20:47.300
And so you gotta get past that.

20:47.300 --> 20:48.900
That takes like a solid two weeks

20:48.900 --> 20:51.820
to get through all those damn dialogue boxes.

20:51.820 --> 20:56.580
And once you do that, you hook up the eGPU,

20:56.580 --> 20:57.660
it was remarkable.

20:57.660 --> 21:01.220
So I would work on a project in Final Cut,

21:01.220 --> 21:03.820
and the entire system would become aware

21:03.820 --> 21:05.620
of the presence of an eGPU,

21:05.620 --> 21:08.980
and applications could elect to use that eGPU,

21:08.980 --> 21:11.380
or I could go in and tell them to prefer it even.

21:11.380 --> 21:13.380
And what would happen is I could render something,

21:13.380 --> 21:16.580
and Final Cut would dispatch work to the eGPU,

21:16.580 --> 21:19.780
it would dispatch work to the AMD GPU

21:19.780 --> 21:21.620
that's built into the laptop,

21:21.620 --> 21:24.300
and it would dispatch work to the Intel CPU.

21:24.300 --> 21:25.140
Wow.

21:25.140 --> 21:27.780
You would manage all of that in the background,

21:27.780 --> 21:30.220
effectively utilizing all of those cores.

21:30.220 --> 21:35.220
And on this 2017 MacBook, I am crushing out video

21:35.660 --> 21:38.220
that you wouldn't think should be possible on this thing.

21:38.220 --> 21:39.620
And then the thermal throttling kicks in,

21:39.620 --> 21:41.460
and then it slows down a little bit,

21:41.460 --> 21:43.060
because it's a Mac after all.

21:43.060 --> 21:45.420
But fundamentally, they have something wrong.

21:45.420 --> 21:47.460
There's a sickness in this platform

21:47.460 --> 21:50.260
that is not competitive with Linux,

21:50.260 --> 21:53.180
but it doesn't mean it is not competitive.

21:53.180 --> 21:55.620
What is hard for us to understand and appreciate

21:55.620 --> 22:00.220
is Apple's style here has been really easy

22:00.220 --> 22:03.020
for third-party manufacturers, hardware makers,

22:03.020 --> 22:05.540
people that are making interfaces,

22:05.540 --> 22:08.660
people that are high-end audio interfaces like Apollo

22:08.660 --> 22:10.820
that are several thousands of dollars

22:10.820 --> 22:12.700
and only work with Macs,

22:12.700 --> 22:16.140
or audio or video editing surfaces that work with the Mac,

22:16.140 --> 22:19.420
or software that comes out on Mac OS.

22:19.420 --> 22:22.180
There is a limited scope of problems

22:22.180 --> 22:23.020
that they have to solve.

22:23.020 --> 22:24.380
There's a known set of hardware,

22:24.380 --> 22:25.940
and there's a known set of OSes.

22:25.940 --> 22:28.900
And Apple only supports a few OS releases at a time,

22:28.900 --> 22:30.860
so it's a very narrow spectrum you have to support.

22:30.860 --> 22:32.460
And the flip side of that support

22:32.460 --> 22:34.820
means you can optimize better for what you are supporting.

22:34.820 --> 22:37.220
And if you're writing something for a pro user,

22:37.220 --> 22:39.260
you can almost guarantee they're on the latest OS.

22:39.260 --> 22:40.740
In fact, if you buy a Mac Pro today,

22:40.740 --> 22:42.380
you can only run Catalina.

22:42.380 --> 22:44.420
You can't run an older version of Mac OS.

22:44.420 --> 22:46.820
So you can guarantee that your customer

22:46.820 --> 22:49.660
is on a certain set of hardware and software,

22:49.660 --> 22:52.180
and that that software gets revved every year

22:52.180 --> 22:53.380
on a yearly cadence,

22:53.380 --> 22:55.660
which is a built-in reason to then prompt your users

22:55.660 --> 22:56.780
to buy the next version,

22:56.780 --> 22:58.580
which adds support for the new OS,

22:58.580 --> 23:01.700
so you have a guaranteed revenue bump every year.

23:01.700 --> 23:04.700
So there's a real healthy third-party ecosystem

23:04.700 --> 23:05.540
around them.

23:05.540 --> 23:06.380
That's a whole lifecycle you can just sort of

23:06.380 --> 23:07.200
latch right onto.

23:07.200 --> 23:08.580
Hardware and software.

23:08.580 --> 23:12.580
Well, I'm not so sure you can be that confident

23:12.580 --> 23:13.620
that people are on Catalina

23:13.620 --> 23:15.460
or whatever the latest Mac OS is,

23:15.460 --> 23:19.900
because the second-hand market for Macs is so strong

23:19.900 --> 23:22.420
that people will buy older Macs.

23:22.420 --> 23:24.900
There's a whole series of YouTube channels

23:24.900 --> 23:28.240
of people reviving old Macs and keeping them running

23:28.240 --> 23:30.680
with whatever the latest version of Mac OS is

23:30.680 --> 23:31.520
that they'll run.

23:31.520 --> 23:35.540
And for some of them, it's older than Catalina.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.900
And people have these Macs kicking around.

23:37.900 --> 23:39.980
Like, I've got a MacBook Air kicking around here,

23:39.980 --> 23:41.540
and that's not running Catalina.

23:41.540 --> 23:43.540
So I don't think you can be super confident.

23:43.540 --> 23:45.940
Like, sure, if you're following the gravy train

23:45.940 --> 23:48.860
of people who are always buying and revving

23:48.860 --> 23:50.500
to the next device every year,

23:50.500 --> 23:52.820
if they're doing that annual update.

23:52.820 --> 23:55.540
But I think your average Joe buys a Mac and keeps it

23:55.540 --> 23:59.000
until they run it into the ground and then buy another one.

23:59.000 --> 23:59.840
I agree.

23:59.840 --> 24:01.620
You're an average Mac user, absolutely.

24:01.620 --> 24:05.360
But where Apple gets you is certain hardware

24:05.360 --> 24:09.300
requires Catalina, and certain software like Final Cut

24:09.300 --> 24:12.020
to have eGPU support also requires Catalina.

24:12.020 --> 24:14.780
So if you're a certain class, or Xcode, for example,

24:14.780 --> 24:18.320
if you're an Xcode developer and you want live Swift previews

24:18.320 --> 24:21.420
when you're writing an iOS app, you have to be on Catalina.

24:21.420 --> 24:22.420
That's true.

24:22.420 --> 24:25.940
And I also, while I'm here, I wanna mention,

24:25.940 --> 24:29.020
I think it's interesting you set aside a budget

24:29.020 --> 24:31.460
of like 50 bucks to get yourself

24:31.460 --> 24:33.300
what you might call a working desktop.

24:33.300 --> 24:34.300
Right.

24:34.300 --> 24:38.980
And I think it's interesting because that's the kind of model

24:38.980 --> 24:41.420
that I think the elementary guys are going for,

24:41.420 --> 24:44.740
which is, you know, give you your basic desktop

24:44.740 --> 24:47.560
that has nice features, it's beautiful,

24:47.560 --> 24:51.180
but expect you to pay for the little applications

24:51.180 --> 24:52.460
that you need here and there.

24:52.460 --> 24:53.900
Now, their model is slightly different.

24:53.900 --> 24:56.020
It's not 30 bucks per application.

24:56.020 --> 24:57.600
It's pay what you want.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.660
But they're certainly striving to ensure

24:59.660 --> 25:01.540
that developers are being paid

25:01.540 --> 25:02.860
for the software that they develop.

25:02.860 --> 25:04.940
And I don't think that's unreasonable.

25:04.940 --> 25:08.000
I think it's a good thing that on Linux,

25:08.000 --> 25:10.860
we're starting to see more of that prevalence

25:10.860 --> 25:14.300
of people being paid for work they do,

25:14.300 --> 25:16.300
which is really super common on the Mac.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.820
And it's just second nature on the Mac.

25:18.820 --> 25:20.780
You need a thing, you pay for it, right?

25:20.780 --> 25:23.380
But on Linux, there's that resistance.

25:23.380 --> 25:25.700
And I think it's slowly coming.

25:25.700 --> 25:30.700
I think with elementary improving their software store story

25:31.340 --> 25:34.620
and Flatpak improving their software store story,

25:34.620 --> 25:37.620
I think it will only improve on Linux as well.

25:37.620 --> 25:39.140
People will up the game.

25:39.140 --> 25:39.980
I agree.

25:39.980 --> 25:42.540
In fact, that's a bit where I was gonna go with this is,

25:42.540 --> 25:45.660
what's great about Linux is you can have these standups

25:45.660 --> 25:47.700
where something is tried like exactly that,

25:47.700 --> 25:48.900
like what elementary OS is doing,

25:48.900 --> 25:50.940
which you don't get with the Mac platform.

25:50.940 --> 25:53.940
But I thought I should give at least a fair crack

25:53.940 --> 25:55.620
at what you do get with the Mac platform.

25:55.620 --> 25:57.900
And I think it's that third party ecosystem,

25:57.900 --> 26:00.700
hardware, software, that they've really nailed.

26:00.700 --> 26:02.720
And it's a real tight experience.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.220
Right, I mean, we've talked about some of the advantages

26:04.220 --> 26:06.340
of the SDK supports that are out there.

26:06.340 --> 26:08.700
That's a very consistent platform and internal services

26:08.700 --> 26:09.760
that are all unified.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.220
Yeah, but you remember at the start of this,

26:11.220 --> 26:13.420
I said Mac OS is a specialist OS

26:13.420 --> 26:15.420
and Linux is a general platform that can be-

26:15.420 --> 26:17.060
Yeah. Built into something.

26:17.060 --> 26:19.180
I think it's easier to go from a general platform

26:19.180 --> 26:22.040
into a specific thing than from a specialist platform

26:22.040 --> 26:23.020
into a general thing.

26:23.020 --> 26:26.280
And what Mac OS specializes in,

26:26.280 --> 26:28.780
and I think you need to be really clear about this,

26:29.820 --> 26:32.980
is it fundamentally lives and dies by Apple's interests.

26:32.980 --> 26:35.540
When they're focused on other things like the iPhone

26:35.540 --> 26:37.520
or maybe AR glasses one day,

26:38.500 --> 26:42.540
the hardware and the software at the same time

26:42.540 --> 26:44.340
suffer substantially.

26:44.340 --> 26:46.620
You can still see the knock-on effect of this

26:46.620 --> 26:48.260
evident on the platform today.

26:48.260 --> 26:52.620
This 2017 MacBook Pro is a living example

26:52.620 --> 26:54.820
of when they took their eye off the ball for a while.

26:54.820 --> 26:59.100
And that I think betrays the biggest weakness long-term

26:59.100 --> 27:01.160
of the platform is it will always live and die

27:01.160 --> 27:02.500
by Apple's interests.

27:02.500 --> 27:07.380
What it specializes in is being a strategic product

27:07.380 --> 27:10.820
for Apple, which has complimentary benefits

27:10.820 --> 27:14.260
for third party ecosystems because of the dynamics of that.

27:14.260 --> 27:16.420
But it doesn't mean it shall always remain that way.

27:16.420 --> 27:21.160
In fact, the transition to ARM could be a great opportunity

27:21.160 --> 27:23.020
to lock things down even further.

27:23.020 --> 27:26.200
Maybe every app now has to be signed by Apple.

27:26.200 --> 27:29.120
Maybe that's enforced at a hardware level in the Macs.

27:29.120 --> 27:31.020
So now Hackintoshes aren't as viable.

27:31.020 --> 27:33.500
And just somebody writing software, building it,

27:33.500 --> 27:37.460
and running it on a Mac becomes no longer tenable.

27:37.460 --> 27:40.380
That's possible as long as Apple's customers don't mind.

27:40.380 --> 27:42.060
They have to walk a line there,

27:42.060 --> 27:44.900
but you can guarantee they're gonna walk the side

27:44.900 --> 27:47.900
of the line that we're not gonna like very much.

27:47.900 --> 27:52.020
It's a very quantifiable, predictable ecosystem,

27:52.020 --> 27:53.940
and it has a premium customer base,

27:53.940 --> 27:57.980
but it will always suffer that fundamental flaw.

27:57.980 --> 28:00.700
Its master is not the owner.

28:00.700 --> 28:02.380
Its master will always be Apple

28:02.380 --> 28:06.100
because their whole platform affects your Mac.

28:06.100 --> 28:09.500
So whatever their long-term version of the market is

28:09.500 --> 28:10.960
will affect your Mac.

28:10.960 --> 28:13.700
Over time, the ecosystem will get locked down,

28:13.700 --> 28:15.900
and general operating systems like Linux

28:15.900 --> 28:18.180
that have been built up into specialists

28:18.180 --> 28:20.100
like elementary OS or Ubuntu

28:21.260 --> 28:23.140
will really be our last refuge.

28:23.140 --> 28:25.380
They really will, and so that's why,

28:25.380 --> 28:28.420
even if we can never quite nail integrating

28:28.420 --> 28:30.980
with all the eGPU manufacturers

28:30.980 --> 28:33.660
or the people that are making cool editing hardware,

28:33.660 --> 28:35.920
even if we can never really nail that,

28:36.860 --> 28:40.100
the Linux desktop is going to be more important than ever

28:40.100 --> 28:42.140
as these platforms continue to evolve,

28:42.140 --> 28:46.140
but it might only appeal to certain types of users.

28:46.140 --> 28:48.540
Different distros will appeal to different types,

28:49.580 --> 28:52.820
but I think when we're thinking about the future of Linux

28:52.820 --> 28:54.700
and trying to advocate for the platform

28:54.700 --> 28:56.340
or trying to market for the platform

28:56.340 --> 28:58.500
or trying to make it the best platform for gamers,

28:58.500 --> 29:01.260
we need to be realistic about what it can accomplish

29:01.260 --> 29:02.820
and what it can do really well,

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
and I think you just look at the success

29:06.000 --> 29:07.580
of things like open-source software,

29:07.580 --> 29:10.180
like VLC and Blender and Firefox, et cetera, et cetera,

29:10.180 --> 29:13.540
et cetera, or Docker, to prove how successful free

29:13.540 --> 29:15.780
and open-source software can be,

29:15.780 --> 29:20.140
and then ask why Linux is still continuing to shrink

29:20.140 --> 29:22.480
in a lot of areas of the market on the desktop.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.860
Like the Steam stats, I know everybody hates these,

29:24.860 --> 29:28.900
but they just came out again, and we're down again.

29:28.900 --> 29:30.200
Meanwhile, the Mac's up.

29:30.200 --> 29:39.200
The Mac went from 0.14% to 3.15% in February.

29:39.200 --> 29:40.340
Is that possible?

29:42.080 --> 29:45.780
And Windows dropped slightly to 96%.

29:45.780 --> 29:48.360
Linux is hanging in at 0.83%.

29:48.360 --> 29:49.980
It was at 0.9 in January.

29:49.980 --> 29:53.020
It's gone down, but what's even more frustrating

29:53.020 --> 29:56.060
is it's been years now.

29:56.060 --> 29:57.940
Protons have been around for a year and a half.

29:57.940 --> 30:00.020
Like it's been a while,

30:00.020 --> 30:01.740
and we're still struggling to even crack

30:01.740 --> 30:05.100
these basic numbers that computers that barely ship

30:05.100 --> 30:07.440
with functional GPUs can kick our butts on.

30:07.440 --> 30:08.660
Like we just have to be honest.

30:08.660 --> 30:11.540
There's just certain use cases we're not the strongest at.

30:11.540 --> 30:13.620
There's others we dominate, we're awesome at.

30:13.620 --> 30:15.460
And I mean, I think they touched on this very well

30:15.460 --> 30:16.940
in late night Linux.

30:16.940 --> 30:17.860
Computing moves on, right?

30:17.860 --> 30:20.460
We add new paradigms, and most people just don't care

30:20.460 --> 30:21.740
that much about the desktop.

30:21.740 --> 30:23.100
I mean, if you do, then Linux is there,

30:23.100 --> 30:24.860
and it's a great option that you can specialize

30:24.860 --> 30:27.020
and tweak and make your own.

30:27.020 --> 30:28.600
But for the most part, since you can get

30:28.600 --> 30:31.580
all these open source apps on pretty much every platform,

30:31.580 --> 30:34.160
or you're using web-based apps anyway,

30:34.160 --> 30:35.620
why switch what you have now at works?

30:35.620 --> 30:38.580
And I mean, most normal users don't care that much

30:38.580 --> 30:41.420
about the specifics of the tool that they have to use.

30:41.420 --> 30:43.820
Yesterday, you and I were kind of making

30:43.820 --> 30:47.140
a really bad comparison to like a Tesla,

30:47.140 --> 30:49.420
which you could say like maybe the Mac is a Tesla.

30:49.420 --> 30:54.340
It's got self-driving, it's very, very expensive.

30:54.340 --> 30:56.020
Any maintenance you do on it, or like, you know,

30:56.020 --> 30:56.860
wheel replacement, anything.

30:56.860 --> 30:58.780
Gotta go back to that specific vendor.

30:58.780 --> 31:02.780
Very expensive, versus a, what would be like,

31:02.780 --> 31:03.780
what would Linux be, a Jeep?

31:03.780 --> 31:04.740
What would it be, a truck?

31:04.740 --> 31:07.020
It's a versatile vehicle that you've kind of

31:07.020 --> 31:08.740
built up yourself over time.

31:08.740 --> 31:10.140
You have easy access to the engine,

31:10.140 --> 31:12.140
you can swap things out, no problem.

31:12.140 --> 31:14.660
But if you want things like self-driving,

31:14.660 --> 31:16.500
well, there's maybe not a standard solution for that,

31:16.500 --> 31:17.880
and you're gonna have to assemble it yourself.

31:17.880 --> 31:19.260
Right, exactly.

31:19.260 --> 31:23.400
And there's different products for different types of people,

31:23.400 --> 31:26.060
or some jobs require something that you can customize,

31:26.060 --> 31:28.340
or some people prefer to work in an environment

31:28.340 --> 31:29.900
that's more tailored to them.

31:29.900 --> 31:33.240
The Mac users are happy to set aside a budget of 50 bucks

31:33.240 --> 31:34.460
to solve their problems.

31:34.460 --> 31:37.080
The Linux users are like, well, that's just built in.

31:37.080 --> 31:38.860
Or if it's not built in, it's an extension away.

31:38.860 --> 31:42.180
I wanna chime in here a little bit on the Mac conversation

31:42.180 --> 31:44.420
and the Steam survey conversation.

31:44.420 --> 31:48.540
First off, I've never used a Mac to play Steam games on,

31:48.540 --> 31:50.940
but I have used Linux and Windows.

31:50.940 --> 31:55.940
I have a 2015 MacBook Pro that actually runs

31:56.380 --> 32:00.980
elementary Pop OS Ubuntu pretty good.

32:00.980 --> 32:02.620
So you don't have to,

32:02.620 --> 32:05.400
I think they still make decent hardware.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.960
I think you could debate that with their latest

32:07.960 --> 32:11.100
butterfly keyboard and touch bar and all that.

32:11.100 --> 32:14.880
But that 2015 that I have is still a great little machine,

32:14.880 --> 32:16.440
and it runs Linux great.

32:16.440 --> 32:21.260
And me personally, for my workflow, which is daily on a Mac,

32:21.260 --> 32:23.860
I haven't spent any money on the store

32:23.860 --> 32:26.780
to get any of these little personalization apps.

32:26.780 --> 32:30.300
I literally have the Adobe Creative Suite,

32:30.300 --> 32:32.340
Mumble, what we're recording on now,

32:32.340 --> 32:35.460
Audacity, Quossel, and VS Code.

32:35.460 --> 32:37.900
I wanted to have it like my workstation,

32:37.900 --> 32:39.700
like where I have menu meters,

32:39.700 --> 32:42.620
and it's something where if I was gonna live here,

32:42.620 --> 32:44.140
how would I really wanna customize it?

32:44.140 --> 32:46.940
Like I can customize an OS that I prefer to use.

32:46.940 --> 32:49.180
That was my philosophy there.

32:49.180 --> 32:51.500
And it's clear that it's doable,

32:51.500 --> 32:54.700
but my home for that kind of mindset is better on Linux.

32:54.700 --> 32:57.580
And I kind of like the idea of embracing Linux

32:57.580 --> 33:01.180
as a professional power workstation.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.660
That's why I find where Gnome Shell's going

33:03.660 --> 33:05.020
and what it's fixing.

33:05.020 --> 33:05.940
In the back of my mind,

33:05.940 --> 33:08.300
when I read that news story we did today,

33:08.300 --> 33:10.060
I hear this is going to make it

33:10.060 --> 33:12.460
a more professional grade workstation.

33:12.460 --> 33:14.820
Something that's faster, cleaner, leaner,

33:14.820 --> 33:16.320
better put together.

33:16.320 --> 33:19.940
And I'm surprised, but kind of pleased to see

33:19.940 --> 33:24.200
that I think System76 is on a similar line of thinking.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.780
We sat down with two individuals, Maria and Michael.

33:27.780 --> 33:29.220
Maria is a UX architect,

33:29.220 --> 33:31.940
and Michael is the product engineer

33:31.940 --> 33:34.620
and one of the maintainers of Pop! OS.

33:34.620 --> 33:36.660
And I think they're seeing some demand from power users

33:36.660 --> 33:38.940
to add features to the Pop! OS experience,

33:38.940 --> 33:43.140
and they're starting with tiling in their 2004 release.

33:43.140 --> 33:45.580
So both Maria and Michael from System76

33:45.580 --> 33:47.420
are joining us today to tell us a little bit

33:47.420 --> 33:50.780
about the advances they're making in Pop! Shell.

33:50.780 --> 33:52.740
Michael, could you describe it to us?

33:52.740 --> 33:55.620
Pop! Shell is advanced tiling window management

33:55.620 --> 33:58.260
for the Gnome desktop in Pop! OS.

33:58.260 --> 34:00.200
That is a nice, concise elevator pitch.

34:00.200 --> 34:04.220
So we're bringing with 2004 version of Pop! OS,

34:04.220 --> 34:06.380
it's tiling inside of Gnome Shell.

34:06.380 --> 34:07.880
It's not replacing Gnome Shell?

34:07.880 --> 34:09.780
Yes, inside as an extension.

34:09.780 --> 34:11.880
This is going to be something that will really appeal,

34:11.880 --> 34:13.380
I think, to power users.

34:13.380 --> 34:14.460
I'm kind of curious about that,

34:14.460 --> 34:16.060
because normally when I think tiling,

34:16.060 --> 34:17.580
I do think sort of advanced users,

34:17.580 --> 34:20.820
maybe people who are using a more niche distro than Pop! OS

34:20.820 --> 34:23.580
or who really like customizing their desktop,

34:23.580 --> 34:25.660
but this seems, I played with it a little bit,

34:25.660 --> 34:27.980
this seems way more accessible, and I'm curious,

34:27.980 --> 34:29.540
what are the motivations for adding these

34:29.540 --> 34:31.100
quote unquote advanced features

34:31.100 --> 34:33.300
to an otherwise very friendly shell?

34:33.300 --> 34:36.300
Everyone at System, or at least most people at System76

34:36.300 --> 34:39.100
are using tiling window management,

34:39.100 --> 34:40.900
and many of the members in our community

34:40.900 --> 34:43.480
have also been using i3.

34:43.480 --> 34:45.300
So it's popular inside the team, huh?

34:45.300 --> 34:46.140
Yes.

34:47.380 --> 34:52.140
Maria, I thought Pop! OS was, this is my bias,

34:52.140 --> 34:54.740
but I thought it was a distro for new customers

34:54.740 --> 34:56.780
that were buying their first Linux laptop.

34:56.780 --> 35:00.180
I don't think we necessarily defined it that way,

35:00.180 --> 35:04.360
but there is certainly a large subset of our users

35:04.360 --> 35:05.980
who are very new to Linux.

35:05.980 --> 35:08.060
Apparently Pop! OS is also, we found out,

35:08.060 --> 35:12.700
very popular among those newcomers, if I can say so.

35:12.700 --> 35:15.140
So part of the motivation, I think,

35:15.140 --> 35:18.100
behind trying to make tiling more accessible

35:18.100 --> 35:22.360
and create maybe a better, more easily approachable system

35:22.360 --> 35:25.760
to actually enable not just power users,

35:25.760 --> 35:30.000
because power users obviously is our largest concern,

35:30.000 --> 35:32.020
but we also make it easy for anyone

35:32.020 --> 35:35.180
who wants to try using the tiling manager,

35:35.180 --> 35:37.420
because we see a lot of value in it.

35:37.420 --> 35:40.660
Sure, and so is it fairly easily invoked?

35:40.660 --> 35:42.540
Michael, if I'm a regular Gnome Shell user,

35:42.540 --> 35:43.980
can I just start experimenting with this

35:43.980 --> 35:45.340
and then turn it off if I don't like it?

35:45.340 --> 35:47.140
How is that process gonna work for users?

35:47.140 --> 35:48.980
Yeah, there's a pop-up menu

35:48.980 --> 35:51.300
that you can toggle the features on and off.

35:51.300 --> 35:52.340
Nice and easy.

35:52.340 --> 35:55.580
I noticed that you've also added a launcher sort of facility,

35:55.580 --> 35:58.000
and I'm wondering, what was the motivation there?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.140
The motivation is simply that

36:00.140 --> 36:02.260
if we're already doing searching for Windows,

36:02.260 --> 36:05.380
you may as well just throw in applications launching as well.

36:05.380 --> 36:06.860
Sure.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.580
Okay, yeah, no, that makes sense.

36:08.580 --> 36:10.780
I have kind of a technical nitty-gritty question

36:10.780 --> 36:13.340
that surprised me when I noticed it.

36:13.340 --> 36:14.840
And totally correct me if I'm wrong here,

36:14.840 --> 36:17.060
but is TypeScript the primary language

36:17.060 --> 36:18.780
being used to design this and write it?

36:18.780 --> 36:20.100
Yes, it's the only.

36:20.100 --> 36:22.940
Now, that is an interesting choice.

36:22.940 --> 36:24.620
I've heard a little bit about TypeScript,

36:24.620 --> 36:26.540
and what I've heard has impressed me,

36:26.540 --> 36:29.420
but it wasn't probably what I assumed going into it.

36:29.420 --> 36:31.700
I thought it'd be something super crazy,

36:31.700 --> 36:34.140
like Rust, or really kind of high-level like that.

36:34.140 --> 36:35.980
Can you talk a little bit about using TypeScript

36:35.980 --> 36:37.340
and why it works for this?

36:37.340 --> 36:39.540
Well, ideally, we would like to use Rust,

36:39.540 --> 36:42.500
but you can't for GNOME extensions.

36:42.500 --> 36:46.220
And using JavaScript is very painful if you're used to Rust.

36:46.220 --> 36:47.060
I bet.

36:47.060 --> 36:49.100
TypeScript is the best choice.

36:49.100 --> 36:51.540
Have you run into any issues getting that all to work nicely?

36:51.540 --> 36:54.180
I mean, I know TypeScript can compile down to JavaScript,

36:54.180 --> 36:56.100
but any issues making that play nicely

36:56.100 --> 36:58.660
with GNOME's implementation of JavaScript?

36:58.660 --> 37:00.460
I have a sed script, which fixes

37:00.460 --> 37:02.020
the little discrepancies.

37:02.020 --> 37:03.340
Oh, that's perfect.

37:03.340 --> 37:05.420
Yeah, that'll solve it.

37:05.420 --> 37:08.020
So what's the long-term play here?

37:08.020 --> 37:12.220
Is this going to develop into a full-fledged tiling extension?

37:12.220 --> 37:14.580
Yeah, it's planning to do that.

37:14.580 --> 37:20.100
What should our expectations be going into the 2004 release?

37:20.100 --> 37:23.180
Much of what you would expect from I3,

37:23.180 --> 37:25.740
it should work in here with this extension.

37:25.740 --> 37:26.540
Wow.

37:26.540 --> 37:28.660
And is it portable outside of POP?

37:28.660 --> 37:29.220
Yeah.

37:29.220 --> 37:30.020
Well, there you go.

37:30.020 --> 37:30.580
Good to know.

37:30.580 --> 37:32.860
You just have to be on a more recent version of GNOME Shell.

37:32.860 --> 37:33.620
Definitely.

37:33.620 --> 37:34.740
Yeah.

37:34.740 --> 37:36.580
Well, that is the essential trick right there.

37:36.580 --> 37:39.180
If people can try it out, it might draw more people in.

37:39.180 --> 37:40.340
Maria, did you want to add something?

37:40.340 --> 37:40.980
Go ahead.

37:40.980 --> 37:44.900
Yeah, I wanted to add to the question of what to expect,

37:44.900 --> 37:47.580
because I think one of the relatively big things we

37:47.580 --> 37:51.380
are trying to achieve is to make it easy to switch

37:51.380 --> 37:54.740
between floating mode and the outer tiling.

37:54.740 --> 37:58.540
So I think we see that as somewhat of a big difference

37:58.540 --> 38:00.940
compared to how most of the other tiling we know

38:00.940 --> 38:01.900
managers work.

38:01.900 --> 38:03.300
So you're saying it's kind of nice

38:03.300 --> 38:05.900
because you can just easily switch in and out of the mode,

38:05.900 --> 38:07.780
so whichever one works better for that moment.

38:07.780 --> 38:08.580
Exactly.

38:08.580 --> 38:09.780
Yeah, I can see that, right?

38:09.780 --> 38:11.340
You're in work, you got a lot of terminals up.

38:11.340 --> 38:13.220
Maybe you want that to be nicely laid out.

38:13.220 --> 38:14.340
And then you're at home on the couch,

38:14.340 --> 38:15.580
and you just got a couple, and it's

38:15.580 --> 38:16.900
easy to just operate normally.

38:16.900 --> 38:18.620
Can I apply it per workspace?

38:18.620 --> 38:19.820
Currently, you can.

38:19.820 --> 38:24.620
Oh, now that I would use the crap out of, for sure.

38:24.620 --> 38:27.580
Because I'm essentially doing it now manually on GNOME Shell

38:27.580 --> 38:31.740
on workspace two and three, dedicated to email and chat.

38:31.740 --> 38:32.780
That's great, guys.

38:32.780 --> 38:34.100
Yeah, that's the plan.

38:34.100 --> 38:35.860
Well, thank you for coming on and just telling us

38:35.860 --> 38:36.380
a little bit about it.

38:36.380 --> 38:38.140
We just wanted to kind of get some of these questions

38:38.140 --> 38:40.060
answered so that way we could talk about it intelligently

38:40.060 --> 38:41.460
and inform the audience.

38:41.460 --> 38:43.700
I appreciate you taking a few minutes to share it with us.

38:43.700 --> 38:44.700
Oh, of course.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.060
Thank you for inviting us.

38:46.060 --> 38:47.100
Oh, yeah, guys, for sure.

38:47.100 --> 38:48.420
Maybe we'll chat when it's all done, too.

38:48.420 --> 38:49.780
Is there anything else you want to add?

38:49.780 --> 38:51.220
No, it's just only that we are very

38:51.220 --> 38:54.020
excited about this extension coming up,

38:54.020 --> 38:56.500
and we keep working on it to make it the best user

38:56.500 --> 38:57.700
experience possible.

38:57.700 --> 38:58.620
We're excited about it, too.

38:58.620 --> 38:59.020
It's nice.

38:59.020 --> 38:59.700
Definitely.

38:59.700 --> 39:02.740
And I think it's going to be a nice differentiator for Pop OS

39:02.740 --> 39:05.020
as well, which is pretty cool to see these things developing

39:05.020 --> 39:07.620
over time, which I suspected would start happening.

39:07.620 --> 39:09.740
Yeah, that was one of our main motivations.

39:09.740 --> 39:10.500
Yeah.

39:10.500 --> 39:11.380
Well, very cool.

39:11.380 --> 39:13.020
Well, I look forward to trying it out.

39:13.020 --> 39:13.980
Thank you.

39:13.980 --> 39:15.180
I'm feeling the hype.

39:15.180 --> 39:16.180
I want to try out that.

39:16.180 --> 39:18.220
I want to try out 20.04.

39:18.220 --> 39:19.300
It's pretty nice.

39:19.300 --> 39:23.780
And just having this as a little extension on top of GNOME,

39:23.780 --> 39:25.580
if you want some tiling, the auto tiling,

39:25.580 --> 39:26.540
it's kind of impressed.

39:26.540 --> 39:28.020
It just popped up a couple of windows,

39:28.020 --> 39:31.780
has the nice little edges, the gaps between windows.

39:31.780 --> 39:34.940
Even for being pretty new, not really released yet

39:34.940 --> 39:38.140
or ready for anyone to use it, they've come a long way,

39:38.140 --> 39:40.180
and I think it shows a lot of promise.

39:40.180 --> 39:42.500
So are we all cool with extensions now?

39:42.500 --> 39:42.980
Is that?

39:42.980 --> 39:43.940
Is that?

39:43.940 --> 39:44.620
I'm never sure.

39:44.620 --> 39:45.220
I'm never sure.

39:45.220 --> 39:46.220
There's an official tool, Chris.

39:46.220 --> 39:47.420
I'm always behind.

39:47.420 --> 39:49.640
I'm always the guy that's not for extensions,

39:49.640 --> 39:50.820
and everybody's using extensions,

39:50.820 --> 39:52.220
and I use all the extensions, and people don't

39:52.220 --> 39:52.820
use extensions.

39:52.820 --> 39:54.520
I mean, it might depend a little bit, too.

39:54.520 --> 39:57.380
GNOME 26 is throwing some resources behind this

39:57.380 --> 39:59.260
rather than a random one-off extension

39:59.260 --> 40:00.380
someone wrote two years ago.

40:00.380 --> 40:01.140
Is that it?

40:01.140 --> 40:01.580
That's it.

40:01.580 --> 40:02.180
That's the difference.

40:02.180 --> 40:03.500
I mean, that's a part of it.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.800
There are seemingly some fundamental issues,

40:05.800 --> 40:08.620
but I guess it does come down to does it work for you,

40:08.620 --> 40:10.140
and do you have issues with it?

40:10.140 --> 40:12.140
Kind of feels like things are shifting, though,

40:12.140 --> 40:16.460
with GNOME Shell shipping that official app and whatnot.

40:16.460 --> 40:17.500
I'd try it.

40:17.500 --> 40:20.820
I think I'd try it, especially if I could just go to GNOME

40:20.820 --> 40:23.100
extensions and just turn on, turn it off.

40:23.100 --> 40:25.700
And if anyone does want to play with it, it's really easy.

40:25.700 --> 40:26.860
You just need TypeScript installed.

40:26.860 --> 40:29.940
There's a makefile that'll build it and install it for you,

40:29.940 --> 40:31.220
so that's really easy.

40:31.220 --> 40:33.460
And you need to be on Pop OS 2004.

40:33.460 --> 40:34.860
Well, aren't you already?

40:34.860 --> 40:35.780
I just assume.

40:35.780 --> 40:37.380
There's that little detail as well.

40:37.380 --> 40:39.980
I did get a sneak peek at the Superfan event,

40:39.980 --> 40:43.260
and I was really blown away by what I had seen there,

40:43.260 --> 40:44.780
just even in that early development.

40:44.780 --> 40:48.540
So I think this is interesting, especially with extensions

40:48.540 --> 40:53.060
and the thought for me, anyway, that KDE, for me,

40:53.060 --> 40:54.580
kind of comes with everything baked in.

40:54.580 --> 40:57.260
You have to dig and hunt and find it and apply it

40:57.260 --> 40:58.180
and get it all set up.

40:58.180 --> 40:59.900
And that's cool, no problems with that.

40:59.900 --> 41:03.640
Whereas, to me, GNOME kind of takes a different angle,

41:03.640 --> 41:08.740
and here are extensions that you can add on to your system

41:08.740 --> 41:10.580
to add this additional functionality.

41:10.580 --> 41:13.140
So I think it's just two different ways

41:13.140 --> 41:15.140
to look at the same problem, personally.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.420
Yeah, I mean, I'm glad they're developing it.

41:17.420 --> 41:18.700
I'm glad they're putting the resources behind it.

41:18.700 --> 41:20.060
It's open source.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.900
It's going to be cross-distro.

41:21.900 --> 41:24.500
I think that's a net win overall.

41:24.500 --> 41:26.780
But I think it kind of makes our overall point

41:26.780 --> 41:30.340
that this is an OS that is really

41:30.340 --> 41:35.380
well-suited for advanced users, much like of previous eras

41:35.380 --> 41:37.980
where there were people who loved to build radios,

41:37.980 --> 41:41.380
or there were people who loved to tinker on cars.

41:41.380 --> 41:45.740
There's another generation now that is of a similar wiring

41:45.740 --> 41:47.620
and has found Linux, I think.

41:47.620 --> 41:49.300
That's so interesting.

41:49.300 --> 41:51.340
How else could System76 do this, right?

41:51.340 --> 41:53.900
I mean, they're not going to build their whole own operating

41:53.900 --> 41:54.420
system.

41:54.420 --> 41:57.580
That's probably too much to ask to secure and implement

41:57.580 --> 41:59.140
all these features.

41:59.140 --> 42:01.900
You can't really rebadge Windows or Mac.

42:01.900 --> 42:03.460
But Linux, have at it.

42:03.460 --> 42:05.460
I'm dying to hear what you think of it, Bopi.

42:05.460 --> 42:07.300
I think it's great that they're innovating

42:07.300 --> 42:10.500
on top of all the work that others are doing

42:10.500 --> 42:13.340
and being able to deliver what their customers ask for.

42:13.340 --> 42:15.440
So their customers clearly ask them

42:15.440 --> 42:20.700
for bespoke, beautiful computers that are high-performing

42:20.700 --> 42:24.260
and have open-source internals.

42:24.260 --> 42:25.180
And they've delivered.

42:25.180 --> 42:26.760
And now their customers are clearly

42:26.760 --> 42:30.220
asking them for features in the desktop that

42:30.220 --> 42:34.420
don't ship by default in either Ubuntu or upstream GNOME.

42:34.420 --> 42:36.900
So they're delivering them to their users.

42:36.900 --> 42:39.180
It's exactly what Linux is all about.

42:39.180 --> 42:42.660
You build a solution for the problem you have.

42:42.660 --> 42:45.140
They do have a pretty tight loop there,

42:45.140 --> 42:48.060
because they're the support for the hardware as well.

42:48.060 --> 42:49.700
So in theory, you're probably getting

42:49.700 --> 42:52.100
a decent amount of direct customer feedback,

42:52.100 --> 42:55.940
maybe in a channel that's more unique to traditional distros.

42:55.940 --> 43:00.860
They have a really active Mattermost chat room,

43:00.860 --> 43:06.340
chat client thing, where customers and users who

43:06.340 --> 43:09.460
are clearly running Pop OS on something that's not a System

43:09.460 --> 43:12.780
76 hardware, and they're asking technical questions,

43:12.780 --> 43:14.760
and the developers are there.

43:14.760 --> 43:16.880
All the familiar names you know from System 76

43:16.880 --> 43:18.940
are in there answering their questions.

43:18.940 --> 43:23.060
So yeah, they have a direct line from their developers to users.

43:23.060 --> 43:24.940
Yeah, interesting.

43:24.940 --> 43:26.300
Would you give it a try?

43:26.300 --> 43:26.900
Yeah, sure.

43:26.900 --> 43:27.900
I'll give it a try.

43:27.900 --> 43:29.780
I didn't really get on super well

43:29.780 --> 43:31.500
with tiling window managers.

43:31.500 --> 43:35.200
And right now, I'm in a mode of trying

43:35.200 --> 43:39.340
to stay as close to upstream stock Ubuntu as possible,

43:39.340 --> 43:42.140
because we've got this little LTS release around the corner.

43:42.140 --> 43:44.420
So I kind of need to test that, yeah.

43:44.420 --> 43:46.900
Yeah, maybe an after-release kind of thing.

43:46.900 --> 43:48.460
Yeah, or on another machine.

43:48.460 --> 43:51.900
One of my other many, many, many thing pads, yes.

43:51.900 --> 43:53.900
Do you think it's daily driver for somebody

43:53.900 --> 43:56.180
who's willing to risk it?

43:56.180 --> 43:57.460
Well, what, 2004 or?

43:57.460 --> 43:58.380
Yeah, yeah.

43:58.380 --> 43:59.780
Yeah, totally.

43:59.780 --> 44:02.340
I mean, the standard caveat is don't,

44:02.340 --> 44:03.920
because it's not production ready yet,

44:03.920 --> 44:05.220
and it's not supported.

44:05.220 --> 44:09.420
But if you're an adventurous kind of gung-ho Linux

44:09.420 --> 44:12.180
enthusiast, then yeah, totally do it, totally.

44:12.180 --> 44:15.780
Feels like things are shaping up pretty good.

44:15.780 --> 44:17.540
Obviously, the last couple of releases

44:17.540 --> 44:18.780
have been really solid.

44:18.780 --> 44:21.300
But the ZFS support's getting to a special state.

44:21.300 --> 44:23.380
You've got this new release of Gnome Shell

44:23.380 --> 44:28.100
that's looking like it's going to be really good.

44:28.100 --> 44:30.340
Could be another one of those.

44:30.340 --> 44:31.920
I mean, you guys got to knock this off.

44:31.920 --> 44:34.060
You got to ship it late or something.

44:34.060 --> 44:35.580
This is a good one.

44:35.580 --> 44:37.540
I've been using it for a while, and since I've

44:37.540 --> 44:41.780
formatted my drive, I've got a clean install.

44:41.780 --> 44:45.100
And by crikey, this is faster than it was before.

44:45.100 --> 44:46.260
It really is.

44:46.260 --> 44:47.220
It's much better.

44:47.220 --> 44:49.300
So I'm really happy with this.

44:49.300 --> 44:49.800
Yeah.

44:49.800 --> 44:51.380
Wimpy tweeted recently, I think there's

44:51.380 --> 44:55.140
a lot to be optimistic about for the desktop, for Linux desktop.

44:55.140 --> 44:57.300
The other evening, I watched a live stream

44:57.300 --> 45:01.940
using Ubuntu Focal with Gnome 3.35 and Firefox.

45:01.940 --> 45:05.380
The streamer was using OBS on Ubuntu,

45:05.380 --> 45:08.660
and I was having a video call with a friend at the same time.

45:08.660 --> 45:09.460
And that's just it.

45:09.460 --> 45:14.060
It's like there are areas where Mac and Windows are going

45:14.060 --> 45:17.020
to have us beat for a bit, especially when it's working

45:17.020 --> 45:20.100
with an ecosystem of software developers and hardware.

45:20.100 --> 45:21.820
The industry that's already bought in.

45:21.820 --> 45:26.380
Maybe the elementary OS guys can help change some of that.

45:26.380 --> 45:32.020
But over time, we managed to check off another use case

45:32.020 --> 45:35.220
box, and then another one, and then another one.

45:35.220 --> 45:38.460
And then pretty soon, we're sitting here in the future

45:38.460 --> 45:41.300
using our Linux boxes to basically do everything

45:41.300 --> 45:43.700
all day long, every single day without issue.

45:43.700 --> 45:46.220
I mean, OK, maybe more people aren't flocking to use Proton,

45:46.220 --> 45:47.580
but that doesn't mean I can't use it.

45:47.580 --> 45:48.460
It works great for me.

45:48.460 --> 45:49.980
Yeah, and the truth of the matter

45:49.980 --> 45:53.220
is you and I are able to do our jobs full time in Linux,

45:53.220 --> 45:54.340
and it's not a compromise.

45:54.340 --> 45:56.720
It's not like bending over backwards like it used to be.

45:56.720 --> 45:58.420
I don't have any non-Linux devices,

45:58.420 --> 46:00.540
I mean, as long as you're including Android in there.

46:00.540 --> 46:02.940
Yeah, and whatever it is on your router.

46:02.940 --> 46:04.020
I mean, who knows?

46:04.020 --> 46:07.060
It's probably some net VSD.

46:07.060 --> 46:11.020
Yeah, and so for a lot of us, those boxes

46:11.020 --> 46:13.340
were checked a while ago, or for some of us,

46:13.340 --> 46:14.820
just checked recently.

46:14.820 --> 46:17.460
Thanks for listening, glad you just found us.

46:17.460 --> 46:20.580
Every year, it's like we check another one or just a few more.

46:20.580 --> 46:24.060
Sometimes it happens so subtly we don't even notice.

46:24.060 --> 46:28.220
So if you take a really, really long-term look at it,

46:28.220 --> 46:30.980
it's the best it's ever been right now,

46:30.980 --> 46:31.980
and it's pretty great.

46:31.980 --> 46:34.460
But if the momentum even continues at the pace

46:34.460 --> 46:37.340
it's been, eventually a few more boxes will get checked off.

46:37.340 --> 46:40.420
Another thing, I mean, you look at these improvements

46:40.420 --> 46:44.220
with like PipeWire and GNOME, who knows what's possible.

46:44.220 --> 46:48.260
Mr. Payne, before we go, what do you say we do some pics?

46:48.260 --> 46:50.260
Oh, yes, pics.

46:50.260 --> 46:52.580
I like this first one, Cat.

46:52.580 --> 46:55.860
Cast all the things allows you to send videos

46:55.860 --> 47:00.340
from many, many online resources to your Chromecast,

47:00.340 --> 47:02.180
or local files, it turns out, too.

47:02.180 --> 47:03.980
Yes, I mean, so there's some tools

47:03.980 --> 47:05.700
that are great for sending local files.

47:05.700 --> 47:07.260
There are other tools or websites

47:07.260 --> 47:09.780
that work well if you want to stream from some URL

47:09.780 --> 47:13.260
that you've got, like maybe a HLS stream to the JV feed.

47:13.260 --> 47:14.900
Yeah, that works great.

47:14.900 --> 47:16.060
So that'd be a really super easy way

47:16.060 --> 47:17.500
to just take that URL and just get

47:17.500 --> 47:18.620
a blast of your Chromecast.

47:18.620 --> 47:21.700
Yes, without, you don't have to futz with Twitch or YouTube

47:21.700 --> 47:23.300
or any sort of thing that might show you ads

47:23.300 --> 47:24.980
or take over your display.

47:24.980 --> 47:26.700
Chromecast can just play links.

47:26.700 --> 47:29.420
And much like YouTube DL supports

47:29.420 --> 47:31.620
a lot more than YouTube, Cat seems

47:31.620 --> 47:33.380
to support all kinds of online services.

47:33.380 --> 47:35.660
So it has like integrated support for YouTube DL,

47:35.660 --> 47:36.980
so you can paste a YouTube link.

47:36.980 --> 47:38.500
Oh, it's literally using YouTube DL.

47:38.500 --> 47:42.420
Yes, and then YouTube DL will go grab the actual URL

47:42.420 --> 47:44.900
to that video, and then the Chromecast plays it directly,

47:44.900 --> 47:47.900
which again means you don't have to fuss about using YouTube.

47:47.900 --> 47:50.820
Yeah, or no browser with an extension, no Chrome required.

47:50.820 --> 47:53.580
Yes, oh, and if you have an MP4 file that you'd like to play,

47:53.580 --> 47:55.460
including subtitle support, let's say

47:55.460 --> 47:58.220
you've got those subtitle files already sitting on your disk,

47:58.220 --> 47:59.420
Cat can do that too.

47:59.420 --> 48:00.700
And that's just over the land then.

48:00.700 --> 48:01.380
Yes.

48:01.380 --> 48:02.380
Hmm.

48:02.380 --> 48:04.260
I wonder if that even goes through the Google servers

48:04.260 --> 48:06.020
when you do an MP4 file like that.

48:06.020 --> 48:08.700
No, I think it just talks over the Chromecast advertise itself

48:08.700 --> 48:10.460
as over with MDNS.

48:10.460 --> 48:12.140
And the syntax is super simple, right?

48:12.140 --> 48:14.300
It's like cat command, and then what?

48:14.300 --> 48:16.580
Yeah, you can install it with pip because it's Python.

48:16.580 --> 48:19.580
And then cat, it's got a helpful little help doc to tell you,

48:19.580 --> 48:23.780
but cat cast, and then either your URL or a path

48:23.780 --> 48:25.100
to the file on your file system.

48:25.100 --> 48:27.340
How does it know which Chromecast to send it to?

48:27.340 --> 48:28.300
It will pick one.

48:28.300 --> 48:30.180
I don't know how it picks the device.

48:30.180 --> 48:33.180
It might be like a Google Home type setting involved,

48:33.180 --> 48:35.620
but it does have support for specifying the Chromecast.

48:35.620 --> 48:38.500
OK, so you could just give it a name of a Chromecast,

48:38.500 --> 48:41.180
and then it's all using probably MDNS, right?

48:41.180 --> 48:42.140
Cool, nice one.

48:42.140 --> 48:42.700
That's cat.

48:42.700 --> 48:44.440
We'll have a link to that in the show notes

48:44.440 --> 48:47.340
at linuxunplug.com slash 343.

48:47.340 --> 48:48.940
You can also tell it to just display.

48:48.940 --> 48:51.340
If you want to display a web page on your Chromecast

48:51.340 --> 48:54.180
without having to cast from your laptop, say, it can do that.

48:54.180 --> 48:56.380
And there's a config file, so you can make aliases

48:56.380 --> 48:58.720
for your Chromecast if it's got a long name or something

48:58.720 --> 48:59.060
like that.

48:59.060 --> 49:00.600
You just want to use that all the time.

49:00.600 --> 49:03.080
So yeah, this is my new favorite Chromecast tool,

49:03.080 --> 49:06.420
and I strongly suspect it will be a part of my daily life.

49:06.420 --> 49:07.380
That's pretty cool.

49:07.380 --> 49:08.620
I'm going to get that too.

49:08.620 --> 49:09.740
Thanks for finding that.

49:09.740 --> 49:13.300
And then Mr. Bacon rolls in with the Silver Searcher this week.

49:13.300 --> 49:15.940
It's a code searching tool similar to ACK,

49:15.940 --> 49:18.880
but it says it has a focus on speed.

49:18.880 --> 49:19.540
I like that.

49:19.540 --> 49:20.580
I like it fast.

49:20.580 --> 49:25.780
Yeah, so buddy of mine recently reached out to me,

49:25.780 --> 49:28.660
and he was like, hey, have you ever used Silver Searcher

49:28.660 --> 49:30.480
or covered it in a pic?

49:30.480 --> 49:33.340
And I was like, I don't believe that we have.

49:33.340 --> 49:36.020
But essentially, it started off as a clone of ACK,

49:36.020 --> 49:40.500
and they claim that it's five to 10 times faster.

49:40.500 --> 49:42.460
So get on it.

49:42.460 --> 49:45.660
Get your code searching done quickly.

49:45.660 --> 49:46.780
What do you think, Wes?

49:46.780 --> 49:47.220
What do you think?

49:47.220 --> 49:48.540
You're going to do some code searching?

49:48.540 --> 49:49.940
You have something else you like.

49:49.940 --> 49:51.020
You want to do a third bony pic?

49:51.020 --> 49:53.280
Yeah, no, I definitely like the Silver Searcher.

49:53.280 --> 49:55.300
It's a fantastic program.

49:55.300 --> 49:57.780
But I mean, Chris, you've just got this rule now.

49:57.780 --> 50:00.060
Silver Searcher has a bunch of C involved.

50:00.060 --> 50:00.780
Oh, yeah, no C.

50:00.780 --> 50:01.860
You don't allow that.

50:01.860 --> 50:03.220
You're Rust only, as you make clear.

50:03.220 --> 50:04.940
Right, only Rust is what everybody knows.

50:04.940 --> 50:05.500
I say that.

50:05.500 --> 50:08.540
There's no C code allowed in the studio.

50:08.540 --> 50:11.060
So for that, I have RIPGRAP, which

50:11.060 --> 50:15.300
is in exactly the same sort of vein, but is made in Rust.

50:15.300 --> 50:16.480
And it's so fast.

50:16.480 --> 50:17.480
It's really just great.

50:17.480 --> 50:18.980
And because it's Rust, it's really easy.

50:18.980 --> 50:21.260
The release page, you can just go download a binary,

50:21.260 --> 50:23.380
stick it on your path somewhere, and away you go.

50:23.380 --> 50:25.220
I can't believe you managed to bring it.

50:25.220 --> 50:27.140
You know, we almost went the whole episode

50:27.140 --> 50:28.740
without our epic Rust watch.

50:28.740 --> 50:32.260
Technically, you've got to warn me.

50:32.260 --> 50:36.260
Epic Rust watch on Linux Unplugged.

50:36.260 --> 50:39.500
An update from Wes Payne on something else that uses Rust.

50:39.500 --> 50:40.100
There we go.

50:40.100 --> 50:40.860
See?

50:40.860 --> 50:42.500
I just, it's obligated.

50:42.500 --> 50:44.500
Yeah, ever since we hired that new soundboard guy,

50:44.500 --> 50:46.180
it's in the contract.

50:46.180 --> 50:48.740
Well, that brings us to the end of this week's program.

50:48.740 --> 50:50.100
Thank you so much for listening.

50:50.100 --> 50:52.540
Thank you to the Mumble Room for stopping by and hanging out

50:52.540 --> 50:54.460
with us here on a Tuesday.

50:54.460 --> 50:57.860
Next week is WSLConf, which has just

50:57.860 --> 51:00.700
been converted to an online-only conference,

51:00.700 --> 51:03.860
but come virtually say hi to us.

51:03.860 --> 51:04.900
We'll be there.

51:04.900 --> 51:06.340
Yeah, we'll be there.

51:06.340 --> 51:07.500
We're still going to be live.

51:07.500 --> 51:10.380
We've decided we'll still do the show at the regular time.

51:10.380 --> 51:11.100
So Tuesday.

51:11.100 --> 51:11.660
No excuse.

51:11.660 --> 51:13.060
Show up.

51:13.060 --> 51:17.340
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for the lifetimes.

51:17.340 --> 51:18.260
I'm at Chris Lass.

51:18.260 --> 51:19.060
He's at Wes Payne.

51:19.060 --> 51:21.020
The show's at Linux Unplugged.

51:21.020 --> 51:23.480
Go check out the Ubuntu podcast, and we'll see you right back

51:23.480 --> 51:25.940
here next Tuesday.

51:25.940 --> 51:30.940
I'm Chris Lass.

51:56.940 --> 51:57.940
The Unplugged program.

51:57.940 --> 51:59.940
Ba-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba.

51:59.940 --> 52:02.260
All right, well, so JBot was down for a bit.

52:02.260 --> 52:03.660
It's back up now, JBtitles.com.

52:03.660 --> 52:05.740
Yeah, we didn't lose anything, so go vote.

52:05.740 --> 52:06.620
Oh, really?

52:06.620 --> 52:07.300
Keep suggesting.

52:07.300 --> 52:10.020
We've only got, it looks like, six of them right now.

52:10.020 --> 52:12.060
OK, OK.

52:12.060 --> 52:13.420
So we were talking about this earlier.

52:13.420 --> 52:15.660
I want to kind of go around and see if maybe people

52:15.660 --> 52:18.180
in the Mumble Room remember.

52:18.180 --> 52:21.180
Poppy, what was the first expansion slot standard

52:21.180 --> 52:24.500
that you recall when you started working on computers?

52:24.500 --> 52:27.220
Or working on computers that you dealt with?

52:27.220 --> 52:30.140
A standard, or just a slot that I would plug things into.

52:30.140 --> 52:32.380
The slot type.

52:32.380 --> 52:33.980
Mine was like when New Bus.

52:33.980 --> 52:37.300
And then I remember I had lots of ISA cards.

52:37.300 --> 52:38.840
That was sort of when I got into it.

52:38.840 --> 52:39.700
Yeah.

52:39.700 --> 52:44.740
Every time I watch retro gamers building 486 machines,

52:44.740 --> 52:48.700
and every time I see them with a Visa local bus

52:48.700 --> 52:52.420
on the end of the ISA slot, it makes me sad,

52:52.420 --> 52:53.700
because I backed that.

52:53.700 --> 52:58.220
And I bought loads of Visa local bus cards, super long ones.

52:58.220 --> 52:59.460
And that was a dumb idea.

52:59.460 --> 53:01.820
I should have waited and got PCI, because that

53:01.820 --> 53:03.380
was obviously the winner.

53:03.380 --> 53:05.020
But yeah, ISA was probably.

53:05.020 --> 53:10.420
I remember my first PC was an Epson 8086 with a turbo button.

53:10.420 --> 53:11.460
And it had ISA slots.

53:11.460 --> 53:13.340
And what were you putting, a modem in there,

53:13.340 --> 53:15.300
or a sound card or something, a Sound Blaster?

53:15.300 --> 53:17.740
I actually put an external floppy drive,

53:17.740 --> 53:20.140
because the internal floppy drive was 5 and 1 quarter inch.

53:20.140 --> 53:22.980
So I had to get an external 3 and 1 half inch,

53:22.980 --> 53:25.100
and had to put a card in for that.

53:25.100 --> 53:25.580
Right.

53:25.580 --> 53:27.660
Sure, you got to put a controller card in there

53:27.660 --> 53:29.980
with a big old cable to connect to the external drive.

53:29.980 --> 53:31.220
Oh yeah, it was beautiful.

53:31.220 --> 53:33.540
Beautiful white, pure white floppy drive.

53:33.540 --> 53:35.320
You need that full bus speed when

53:35.320 --> 53:38.260
you're reading those 3 and 1 half inch floppy disks.

53:38.260 --> 53:44.860
In fact, that first PC I had came with an MDA graphics card,

53:44.860 --> 53:47.280
monochrome display adapter, which did no graphics.

53:47.280 --> 53:48.820
It was text only.

53:48.820 --> 53:50.980
And I managed to acquire from where

53:50.980 --> 53:54.060
I worked, my very first job out of college,

53:54.060 --> 53:56.300
there was a Hercules graphics card kicking around.

53:56.300 --> 53:59.180
It was just kicking around in a cupboard, and I got that.

53:59.180 --> 54:01.340
And the upgrade from text only to graphics

54:01.340 --> 54:05.180
was just like chef kiss, so good.

54:05.180 --> 54:09.940
Oh, my first big video card I invested in was a Matrox AGP.

54:09.940 --> 54:11.340
Oh yeah, an AGP.

54:11.340 --> 54:14.500
It had an expansion RAM module as well.

54:14.500 --> 54:17.500
And it came with the first Tomb Raider PC game,

54:17.500 --> 54:20.700
as like a see what you can do with your upgrade.

54:20.700 --> 54:21.580
I was so dumb.

54:21.580 --> 54:23.980
I made the mistake of choosing a motherboard that

54:23.980 --> 54:25.340
had Visa local bus.

54:25.340 --> 54:28.900
But I also made the mistake of buying an IBM PS2 that

54:28.900 --> 54:30.700
had the microchannel architecture.

54:30.700 --> 54:32.460
So I couldn't buy any cards for that thing.

54:32.460 --> 54:35.060
That was just like, came with what it came with,

54:35.060 --> 54:37.020
you're never going to upgrade this thing.

54:37.020 --> 54:39.500
MCA, buddy, MCA, which they thought

54:39.500 --> 54:41.740
was going to be the big thing.

54:41.740 --> 54:46.940
I think my first graphics card was the Riva TNT2,

54:46.940 --> 54:51.220
or I think it was the Rage TNT2 for AGP.

54:51.220 --> 54:57.660
And then shortly after that, it was a PCI Trident 8 megabyte

54:57.660 --> 55:00.100
card so I could run Linux, because it

55:00.100 --> 55:01.220
wouldn't run into the AGP.

55:01.220 --> 55:02.660
Trident Video Cards.

55:02.660 --> 55:06.620
Oh, that name I've seen a million times.

55:06.620 --> 55:12.100
You know, the IBM PS2 was released April 1987,

55:12.100 --> 55:13.060
32 years ago.

55:13.060 --> 55:14.300
Wow.

55:14.300 --> 55:15.300
Yeah.

55:15.300 --> 55:19.140
Which, as the name suggests, is where the PS2 port came from.

55:19.140 --> 55:24.500
And it was a rocking way to run Windows 2.0.

55:24.500 --> 55:29.260
They also had a port of AIX to the PS2 back then,

55:29.260 --> 55:31.260
which sounds horrible.

55:31.260 --> 55:34.060
Could you imagine AIX on a 386 processor?

55:34.060 --> 55:35.100
I know, I don't want to.

55:35.100 --> 55:40.020
Oh, DOS was bad enough.

55:40.020 --> 55:41.020
It's a better world now.

55:41.020 --> 55:41.900
Yeah, it is.

55:41.900 --> 55:42.660
It is.

55:42.660 --> 55:43.300
What about you?

55:43.300 --> 55:45.180
Do you remember what your first interface was?

55:45.180 --> 55:48.580
I remember the thing about AGP, the thing that dawned on me

55:48.580 --> 55:51.460
was, oh, they're going to be changing this all the time.

55:51.460 --> 55:52.620
Like, they just kept getting, like.

55:52.620 --> 55:52.940
Yeah.

55:52.940 --> 55:55.460
I think AGP was the first time I was really sort of bought in

55:55.460 --> 55:59.180
and had got, like, an expensive card to attach to my machine

55:59.180 --> 56:01.340
before I just sort of stuck with the defaults.

56:01.340 --> 56:03.340
What about Mumble Room Carl or Brent?

56:03.340 --> 56:06.700
Either of you have old PC memories or byte?

56:06.700 --> 56:08.620
I stepped into the computer world

56:08.620 --> 56:12.540
when Windows 95 was around with the AGP.

56:12.540 --> 56:16.100
And I still have an AGP video card around.

56:16.100 --> 56:18.340
Yeah, that's coming in handy one day.

56:18.340 --> 56:19.100
You might need it.

56:19.100 --> 56:19.740
You never know.

56:19.740 --> 56:23.100
Surely there's, like, a Thunderbolt AGP adapter.

56:23.100 --> 56:26.260
It still has the VGA and the S-video out on it.

56:26.260 --> 56:27.740
Oh, yeah, of course.

56:27.740 --> 56:30.220
Man, VGA is still around.

56:30.220 --> 56:34.900
I think I had an S-video out was my AGP card at the time.

56:34.900 --> 56:37.820
And I had an old TV I was using with a second monitor.

56:37.820 --> 56:38.500
It was gross.

56:38.500 --> 56:39.900
Yeah, yeah.

56:39.900 --> 56:43.020
I remember when I finally got my hands on a Sony Trinitron

56:43.020 --> 56:45.100
CRT, which was the flat CRT.

56:45.100 --> 56:47.220
Yeah, really nice.

56:47.220 --> 56:48.180
Really nice screens.

56:48.180 --> 56:49.460
Yeah, I remember those.

56:49.460 --> 56:51.860
I still have a Trinitron at my mom's house.

56:51.860 --> 56:56.140
My very first TV I bought with my own money was in 1988.

56:56.140 --> 56:58.380
And it was a 14-inch Sony Trinitron.

56:58.380 --> 57:02.220
And I watched The Matrix on DVD when that first came out

57:02.220 --> 57:05.500
on that 14-inch in widescreen letterbox format.

57:05.500 --> 57:06.620
Oh, happy days.

57:06.620 --> 57:09.980
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
