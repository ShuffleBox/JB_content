1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,900
This round of applause is dedicated to one and only Carl George right there. Mr. Carl,

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:13,480
I have to thank you. I don't think I've eaten better this year. I ate so well while I was

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,880
visiting Texas Cyber Summit.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,880
Incredible.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,880
Right?

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,880
Yeah.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,880
You were very welcome, sir.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,880
Highlight of the trip.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,920
Yeah. Thank you very much, Carl. Also, thank you for driving us around.

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,720
You created a lasting good impression of San Antonio, I've got to say. I mean, I want

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,720
to go back.

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,720
I agree.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,520
I like food a lot, and driving is just kind of a way of life in Texas. Everything's so

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,520
spread out.

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,920
We are so, so thankful, though, because we travel to these places that we have never

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,360
been before. That was my first time in San Antonio.

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,360
Same.

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,200
Jesus, I'm sure you've been in San Antonio plenty of times.

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,920
Yeah, as a kid, but not as of recent, so.

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,000
So you wouldn't necessarily know all the great spots.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
No.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,480
Yeah. And you go there, you don't know where you're at, you have no way of getting around.

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,680
Especially in a big place like Texas, right?

24
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,640
And thankfully we do these shows, and so we have listeners in those areas, and they sort

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:10,000
of are our tour guides in a way. It's so awesome. And the great thing about Carl is if he suggests

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,680
we go to a place, we don't even debate.

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
No, no question.

28
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,400
Which, in a group of people, Carl, you've seen this, in a large group of people, right?

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,560
You could spend like a half hour trying to figure out where to go eat.

30
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,520
And you end up with something not so great.

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,840
Oh man, we ate so good.

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,840
My main concern was, I just didn't want y'all to come to town, and then just go, you know,

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,240
walk around the Riverwalk, and then get back home and say, yeah, well, San Antonio was

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,360
fine. I wanted y'all to have a better experience than that.

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,960
No, and you have that local experience, so you know that hole in the wall. Well, except

36
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,200
for in San Antonio, it's more like that hole outside that has outside seating, but great

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
food.

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,320
Right, like the carnitas place that had one menu item.

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,840
Yeah, when the guy asked if what else was on the menu, and the lady just looked at him

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:05,320
like, uh, there is no other item on the menu.

41
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,080
Hello friends, and welcome into Linux Unplugged, episode 323. I'm Chris.

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
I'm Wes.

43
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,080
323?

44
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Nicely done.

45
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
Is that even a thing anymore?

46
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
It is now.

47
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,120
You've been here since episode 100, so nicely done to you too.

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,000
Well, Mr. Payne, we have a great show. We're going to have our first look at Ubuntu 19.10,

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,920
which is likely releasing just as a, well, maybe when you listen, it kind of depends

50
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,600
on your schedule, but just about as you listen to this, Ubuntu 19.10 is releasing. We've

51
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,720
got some big community news, including a new KDE Plasma, and even more changes for Gnome

52
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:47,820
Shell, which, oh boy, it just got a new Gnome Shell, yeah, it's wild. Plus, not just myself,

53
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,480
not just Wes, but Mr. Cheese and Mr. Drew are here to give you their takes on 19.10.

54
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,480
Hello gentlemen.

55
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,480
Hello.

56
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,080
Hi. Nice to have you here. We all ended up trying out 19.10 for various reasons and all

57
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,680
walked away with different notes, so I think this is going to be a really good one. And

58
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,200
of course, we've got our virtual lug. Hello there, Mumble Room.

59
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,200
Hello.

60
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Hello.

61
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Hello.

62
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Oh, hi.

63
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Oh, hi.

64
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
Howdy.

65
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Hey there.

66
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Look at that, a healthy showing.

67
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,800
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room. Good to have you here. So let's start

68
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,000
out with the community news this week, because we're going to be talking a lot in Gnome Shell

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,360
and MatÃ© later today, so I thought we'd kick things off with some Plasma news. Version

70
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:33,440
5.17 is out today as we record. The big thing here for me is I'm all about, I like that

71
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,400
color grading, and Night Color is built in. It's a color grading system that helps your

72
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,800
eyes relax as the sun sets, as they put it, and it is now in X11. It also recognizes when

73
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,160
you're giving a presentation.

74
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,320
I love that.

75
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,680
It turns on D&D on that screen. That is straight up brilliant. That's next level D&D.

76
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,000
I mean, if you're like me, you have friends who send you embarrassing messages right when

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,720
they know you're giving a presentation.

78
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,200
That's actually a great prank. That is really great. But also, just sort of as a meta feature

79
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,400
for 5.17, things are thriftier than ever with Plasma.

80
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,760
Oh, yeah. It starts so fast. I'm actually running 5.17 right now. I updated it before

81
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,360
doing the show. Pleased to say my Neon install is doing just great, honestly. They finally

82
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,840
ditched Bash for some of the scripts that run as you're starting up Plasma, right? So

83
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,120
you get past the login screen, you've entered your password, you have work to get done.

84
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,360
Before it was totally synchronous. It runs Bash, it waits for the script to complete,

85
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
and then you get a desktop.

86
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,080
I mean, I love Bash, but it's not the fastest thing on the planet.

87
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,880
So now they've rewritten it in C++, and it's totally asynchronous. So login can just start

88
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,000
right once you're authenticated.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,160
That's nice. That is very nice. As well as many, many, many, many other features that

90
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:55,440
are in Plasma, including some system settings, improvements for Thunderbolt support. In fact,

91
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,720
overall, there's just been general improvements to system settings.

92
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh, yeah. Tons of improvements to system settings. And there's more stuff for like ksysguard,

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,040
which can talk about cgroup limits, which you probably have if you're running a whole

94
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,800
bunch of containers or doing fancy system D stuff.

95
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,600
Yeah, I also like that they put some stuff in there for visualization of the NVIDIA GPU

96
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
stats.

97
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Sexy.

98
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,600
That's really nice for Ubuntu users, since the NVIDIA binary driver is now on the ISO.

99
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:29,000
But one of the main new features of Plasma 5.17 display manager kwin is fractional scaling

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
on Wayland.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,040
That's a fancy term. What does it mean? Well, it means you can scale your desktop to suit

102
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,840
your high DPI monitor perfectly, right? You might not need like, a two time scaling that

103
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,400
might be too much. You can dial it down now with fractional support. So you won't have

104
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,300
tiny or gigantic fonts and icons on those 4k screens.

105
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,000
I like it on a 4k screen because I can get a little more real estate without having to

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,480
be too tiny.

107
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,040
And also, I mean, kwin's Wayland support has come a long way, right? I mean, we've been

108
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,320
covering it on this show for years. This was one feature that it's kind of it's kind of

109
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,120
been missing. It's been a standout missing feature that's finally corrected.

110
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,120
Yeah. Also, something that's coming back. If you're an old desktop KDE user and you

111
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,760
miss the ability to close windows with the middle click, it's back, baby. It's back.

112
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,560
Is that just going to confuse some people?

113
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,600
Here's why it's nice. It's a great way when you've got a couple of windows up, you can

114
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,840
close a window without changing focus.

115
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,560
I will say three mouse buttons strictly better than two.

116
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,520
Way better, right? Who doesn't want three mouse buttons? What am I in the 80s? Also,

117
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:40,340
here's a funny one. You can now on X 11, which wasn't really super easy before, properly

118
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,820
map the super key, you know, the little windows can. Yeah, that must have taken some work

119
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,720
in the back end, you know, deep engineering, I think on that one.

120
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,640
It did take some work in the back end. Having done that in Marte over like 18 months. It's

121
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
hard work that

122
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,520
What is it? What is it that's so dang hard? Because it has been a very top requested feature

123
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
of plasma desktop.

124
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,720
I mean, is it just that X is old and broken?

125
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,840
No, it's it's the fact that anything could have a key bound to super. So when that gets

126
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,920
picked up, you need to pass that event along all through the chain of windows so that any

127
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,680
window that's got that in their key bindings can respond when they have focus and it has

128
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,880
to touch lots and lots of parts of the system.

129
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:32,760
Yeah. All right. So I've waffled on this last item here. But let's talk about it. Discover

130
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,560
plasma software manager lets you install, remove and update applications. It's been

131
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,320
improved in this release. It includes better progress bars for the first time. And different

132
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:47,000
like UI feedback indicators that tell you it's working. And they've added icons to properly

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
demonstrate snap applications to help to help you get just some more information. And they've

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,800
helped with better feedback on connection issues. However, maybe we'll get to this in

135
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,680
a little bit. But having gone through a few different desktop environments in the last

136
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,680
couple of days to try out 1910 boy does discover feel like the absolute least favorite part

137
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,400
of the worst. And I hate to say that about free software that people are working really

138
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
hard on.

139
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,000
It's not that it's necessarily terrible. It is usable. I do use it from time to time.

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,720
It's just that the competition has gotten a lot better, frankly. Yeah, I don't I don't

141
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,640
know what the solution here is, because they have diligently worked to make this better

142
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:35,000
for a while. And it still seems like it's behind everything else. And I don't know what

143
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,520
would be better. And I obviously couldn't write something better myself. But boy, does

144
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,080
it feel like the weaker spot of the desktop right now. But it is nice to see some of these

145
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,520
improvements, some of these informational feedback things will go a long way and at

146
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,560
least making it much, much, much more usable than it has in the past. So they do seem to

147
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,480
be taking in the right direction. Yeah, I mean, continue to work is always appreciated.

148
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,520
You do wonder though, it's like, well, when you just start over, yeah, need to figure

149
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,720
out quite what's wrong with the core there. Well, speaking of core core boot is coming

150
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,540
to Comet Lake chips on system 76 laptops, at least two of them, the new 14 inch galgo

151
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:17,120
pro and the new 15.6 inch starter pro laptops will ship with core boot firmware, rather

152
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,560
than a proprietary BIOS. Now, as you probably know, and has been pointed out by Mr. Michael

153
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,040
liable over at for Onyx, these laptops still have Intel proprietary blobs because of course

154
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,960
they do. So it's probably best to think of them as more open than most laptops rather

155
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,760
than being completely open. Yeah, yeah. But still, system 76 is just one of a handful

156
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,680
of PC vendors shipping computers with core boot. purism comes to mind as another but

157
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,360
frankly, system 76 has more compelling and more options for laptops. Yeah, honestly,

158
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,200
this is great to see. I mean, I've I've played with core boot a little and for me the biggest

159
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,200
the biggest blockers, but I just didn't have hardware that was, you know, supported by

160
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,680
it. I think it's a great option. And we need people in this space working on it keeping

161
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:06,160
it modern. I think it lost a lot of momentum after you know, EFI support sort of went mainstream.

162
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,680
If system 76 can keep things working nicely on modern hardware, that should help everyone.

163
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,640
I just thought of this now. I should have thought of it before the show. If anyone at

164
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,800
system 76 wants to let me know, is this guaranteed to now be a thing for all future galgos and

165
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,480
darters? Like will all future darters and galgos just guaranteed have this or is this

166
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,880
just this current line? What do you think of this wimpy? Well, I think it's a great

167
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,000
step towards you know, freeing firmware in computers from proprietary bits and pieces

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,200
that we can't really know what they're poking around at. And coincidentally, while I was

169
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,320
at ubu con last week, I was reacquainted with an organization that I've worked with in the

170
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:59,560
past who are also doing some interesting things with core boot. That's a tease. All right.

171
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:08,600
There's this outfit in Portugal called LibreTrend. Wimpy. You're such a tease sometimes. I know.

172
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,860
And we did some work with them having Ubuntu Mate pre-installed on one of their devices

173
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:22,720
few years ago, which was a core boot device. And it was like a NUC equivalent type device.

174
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,640
Anyway, they sort of went dark for a couple of years and they went away back to the drawing

175
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:35,720
board and they've come back last year with a new desktop machine, which kind of looks

176
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:42,820
like a Mac Mini. And that is a fully core boot enabled device. And they're very proud

177
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:49,080
of that. But more importantly, they're doing work with the LVFS project to deliver core

178
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:58,160
boot firmware updates via LVFS. So that is coming soon. And they also have two laptops,

179
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,840
the Wildebeest and the Wildebeest Pro, neither of which are core boot at the moment. But

180
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,720
what they're doing is they're gauging interest in those two devices to see which of the strongest

181
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:16,780
sellers in order to determine which device they invest the time and effort into getting

182
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:23,800
core boot on. And again, this LVFS work. So they spent about two years doing the engineering

183
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:30,560
upfront for this LibreTrend LibreBox, they call it, which was fully engineered from the

184
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:38,040
very beginning to be core boot. And it's also got TPM2 modules for full disk encryption

185
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,760
and stuff like that, all in hardware. But for the laptops, they've decided they can't

186
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,680
afford that kind of investment each time they do a device. So they're testing the waters

187
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,960
as to which is the more popular unit in order to determine where they put the engineering

188
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
effort in.

189
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,400
What do you suppose the long term benefit for the user is?

190
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:03,240
There's a growing trend, isn't there, to sort of create these devices that do have unencumbered

191
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:11,280
firmware. And there's clearly a large enough niche of users that desire that to support

192
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,560
the, well, first of all, the R&D and the expense of working on this. But there's several companies

193
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,520
around the world doing this now. So I think they're really looking out for that niche

194
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,880
of users that really cares about their privacy.

195
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,760
What a thing. We're becoming a market that actually needs to be addressed. What a hell

196
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,760
of a thing.

197
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,760
That's a nice feeling.

198
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,360
It really is. Gnome Shell's getting better. And we're going to talk a lot about Gnome

199
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,600
Shell, or Gnome Shell as I call it, in a little bit. But what you're about to get on your

200
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,600
latest version of your favorite distro is already out of date. But don't worry, it's

201
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
mostly fixes.

202
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,980
Yeah, Gnome Shell 3.34.1 is heavy on those fixes. I mean, you've got stuff like allowing

203
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,840
the editing of app folder names, making menu animations more consistent, improving performance

204
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,880
when enabling and disabling extensions, which, hey, I sometimes have to do that, fixing screen

205
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,360
dimming on idle, crash fixes, and a variety of animation fixes, which all that doesn't

206
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,880
sound like a lot, but I think it adds up to something noticeable.

207
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,520
Yeah. Plus, there's also code for Wayland full screen compositing bypass, which is a

208
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:24,040
big deal for full screen video and games. But the other thing to watch with these future

209
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,880
gnome developments, sorry, Gnome developments is what happens with Mutter.

210
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,940
Oh, yeah. Okay, so they've got some fixes for Java applications, which I know, I know,

211
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:40,720
but it's still nice to have. Plus fixing the startup of X11 session services on Wayland,

212
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,000
better screenshot and window animation support when scaled, optimizing the booting of untransformed

213
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,700
off screen stage views, various other scaling fixes, and fixing the num lock state for the

214
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,940
native backend. Plus a whole bunch of crash fixes, which, hey, as someone who's complained

215
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,960
about that before, it's really nice to see.

216
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,760
Yeah. It does feel like each release is a big deal.

217
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,440
Yeah. And I think that's what matters here is this is a point release with a lot of usability

218
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,840
and just like, day of, you know, everyday use improvements. And you don't have to wait

219
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,440
for something like gnome 3.36 coming in March.

220
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,400
Yeah, right. Or four or whatever. It really feels like a remarkably different time than

221
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,360
when canonical announced that they were ditching unity seven, doesn't it wimpy?

222
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,480
Yeah, I suppose so. I mean, it's sort of really growing with momentum now. I mean, it's, you

223
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,520
know, it's got all of the mainstream distros shipping it as the default desktop experience

224
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
now.

225
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,080
Right. I mean, hearken back to that era. I was one of the individuals that was pretty

226
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:49,080
outspokenly concerned about performance and stability issues. I don't know if you noticed.

227
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,480
And we switched out our whole studio off of gnome shell because of it. I don't feel like

228
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,640
that would be an issue today.

229
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,920
Yeah, well, hopefully not. I mean, you know, there's a lot of people that have put a considerable

230
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:05,440
amount of effort into improving that situation. And in fact, as we talk, there is a gnome

231
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,360
hack fest taking place in the Netherlands this week. And there are two members of the

232
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:18,080
Ubuntu desktop team, Marco and Seb, who are both present there working on, you know, crushing

233
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:24,620
precisely these kinds of issues. I know that closing the gap between x11 and Wayland is

234
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,920
one of the objectives of this week's hack fest.

235
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,060
Oh, that's great. It really seems like there's been enough back end work done in the past

236
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,040
few years that now some momentum can actually happen. Right. And some of the user facing

237
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,680
features things that we notice, well, those are improving.

238
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:44,600
I think very much so. We'll get to it here in the review in a moment. But I was really

239
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,280
worried we weren't going to be able to even begin to solve the gnome shell problems that

240
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
we had.

241
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,280
We had an episode here where we debated, like, is this whole thing junk? Should we even continue

242
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
to building on it?

243
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,280
Well, I had a real crisis of faith because here's all these top distributions shipping

244
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:07,020
it as the default shell, and it just didn't meet my my muster. Like, too slow, too many

245
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,600
different issues, crashes all the time.

246
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,640
Takes down my whole environment.

247
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,080
Right. And I was extremely worried that so many of the problems were fundamentally at

248
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,460
the core of gnome shell that they were not solvable. But really smart people have looked

249
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:30,480
at this and they've been solving a lot of problems. And it really has become a example

250
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,680
of how different companies with different goals and different priorities can come together

251
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,120
and improve a common piece of free software. It's a pretty good example. It's not perfect

252
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,440
yet. It's not all solved yet. But it has it has become

253
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,240
we have a fantastic desktop environment as a result, right? Much more, much more better,

254
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,480
much more improved, much more usable, much, much faster. All of the bunches you can really

255
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,680
give it. So I think it's really kind of time we kind of get into some of that because he

256
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,720
can't really keep talking about some of these without getting into the review itself. Before

257
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:07,320
we do that, we should probably do a little housekeeping because there's recently been

258
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,240
a batch of brunches. Oh, my. So many. A batch of brunches, Wes.

259
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,840
A batch. Maybe batches. I don't know. So for those of you that are not familiar

260
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,480
with this phenomenon, Brent here, who joins us on the mumble. Hello, Brent.

261
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,860
Oh, hey. Hey, there. Turns out great interviewer. And he really

262
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,600
gets down. You know, I think he does this thing called listening. It's it's new. You've

263
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:34,160
never tried it. Wow. Wow. Cuts deep. See, I listen to that. And Brent just is. He's

264
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,480
a great conversationalist. And so we created this concept Brunch with Brent with Brent

265
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,000
because he also, by the way, makes great brunch. He sits down with somebody and he has a conversation

266
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:52,080
and it just is great podcasting. And so recently, a batch of brunches has been released, including

267
00:18:52,080 --> 00:19:01,160
a chat with Angela Fisher and Alan Jude. Both. You got to go check out extras dot show.

268
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,920
You know, I guess one really neat thing to say about the chat with Alan is that you were

269
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,880
able to visit him in person. Did you go to his house? Yeah, I happened to be about an

270
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:17,160
hour away. Alan lives in the same province as I do. So he's near Toronto. And I got to

271
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,080
I basically said, Hey, Alan, I'm I'm near you. Is there any way I can come crash your

272
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,560
place? And he said, Yeah, yeah, come by. It happened to work out perfectly. It was his

273
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,160
normal podcasting day, but they had recorded some in advance. So he had the whole day off.

274
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,480
So he and I just kind of hung out for a long time and had a great conversation. And I think

275
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,760
that just got released today. So it's a great chat. I listen back and it was a lot of fun

276
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,680
listening back. So I think everybody's gonna enjoy it. What I've just learned is be careful

277
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,920
letting Brent stay at your house. He will interview you as someone who has been interviewed.

278
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,040
You end up telling Brent things you didn't expect. That's right. There's a brunch with

279
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,360
Wes, a brunch with cheese. I believe you're on the docket sometime, huh? Perhaps I'm coming

280
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,000
for you. Yeah, I wanted our brunch to be in person, though. You know, you're just hungry.

281
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,660
I felt like first of all, I did want to eat. And second of all, I felt like if I'm going

282
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:12,640
to expose all, it needs to be in person. So extras dot shows where you catch that we also

283
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:19,780
just released a reverse proxy basics, and we have a container basics coming out. Alex

284
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:25,960
and I sit down with Wes on the reverse proxy basics, talk about nginx traffic, or traffic

285
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,240
as they like to call it. And then in the next one, we get down into the dirties of containers.

286
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, there's a lot of good detail there. And I talked a little bit more about my setup

287
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,960
and my kind of realization that it's more than just hype. There's a practical like even

288
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,920
if you're an old school sys admin, there's a real practical angle to using this technology.

289
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,520
Yeah, right. I mean, Alex is working with containers every day. So good advice. There's

290
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,840
other shows we haven't even talked about yet that are on extras dot show like office hours

291
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:00,560
with Chris operation safe escape with Wes L and a guest production meetings chats with

292
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,380
people from Linux Academy. And we're going to also do a summary of our visit to Texas

293
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,480
cyber summit extras dot show slash subscribe. Just grab that. Yeah, you know, it's a place

294
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,840
where can do a little experimentation. Yeah, if you like what we're doing, you want to

295
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:20,780
see things we're trying follow extras, a batch of brunches and more at extras dot show. Also

296
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:25,560
now up on the Linux Academy community section. That's a free section of the Linux Academy

297
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:31,400
platform where you can sign up without subscribing. We've released a new batch of courses L's

298
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,120
in charge of this and she has some great ones cloud formation, deep dive, database administration

299
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,960
and SQL language basics. And that's never getting old. I mean, you gotta you gotta learn

300
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:48,920
to Google Cloud functions, helm deep dive, and the one that I'm going to be taking the

301
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:56,840
ansible playbook deep dive. Finally. Wow. It's a little aggressive, Wes. I'm right here.

302
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,540
Check those out. We'll have a link in the show notes. You can sign up without having

303
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,560
to pay and get access to all that stuff. And L's always curating that releasing new stuff

304
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,600
over there. So check that out. And extras dot show. Wow. That's a lot of stuff. Are

305
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,280
we good? You good, Wes? You go with? Oh, yeah. Can I? Can I move up? Please do. Okay. All

306
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,520
right. Again, kind of aggressive. You know, I don't think we mentioned to the chat room

307
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,920
that they should be bang suggesting as we go along. Yeah, well, it sounds like J. Bob

308
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,000
might be having some issues. Oh, really? Well, that's what chat room. Thanks. Thanks. I don't

309
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,560
know. I haven't. I did some just suggesting earlier. We got to move that J. But so that

310
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:38,400
J. But is Yeah, no, it's down. Yeah. Well, yeah, we're getting a bad gateway. Oh, start

311
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,920
up the West bot. What do you think? memory? It does do that. Yeah. I mean, how much memories

312
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:48,760
on that box? Yeah, like eight gigs. So you know, it's on the RAM for that for that J.

313
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,680
But Dang it. It happens. I think what we're gonna do is we're gonna I mean, not to be

314
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,040
that guy, but I think we're gonna containerize it. And then we're just gonna put it on a

315
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:04,600
supported system. Because that's on an arch box from like 2013. So it's insane. We really

316
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,120
should probably move on. And it kind of works sometimes. Yeah, I mean, you just got to go

317
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,360
in there and then restart it and then get in the console and then get the TCP IP stack

318
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,460
back online and then get the thing all running again and then get its custom web server up

319
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,560
and go. And then once you've done all of that, and you've forwarded the DNS, you're good

320
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:28,080
to go. So I don't know, you know, we're probably gonna have to make some changes. That's I

321
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,920
mean, it's only perfect that we talk about this though, because 1910 is it's kind of

322
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,280
like one of those releases that you're not going to want to install on a system like

323
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,000
JBOD because you want that running for years. This is this is not the long term support

324
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,640
version of Ubuntu. Right? It's a it's a place to try out new things and maybe preview some

325
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,440
of the features you will enjoy in a long term support in the future. Right. So how do you

326
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,160
say the name the code name? Eon? I don't know. Eon? Yeah, let's go with that. How we doing

327
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:01,680
wimpy? Is it Eon? You pronounce it 1910. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Actually, yes. Confirmed.

328
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,440
We did try to look it up. Right? I mean, you wouldn't try to define what it is. Did you

329
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,280
Yeah, I thought maybe we should have some definitions. I'd like to know. Yeah. Yeah,

330
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,600
I know. I've been really appreciating. It's just it's a silly thing. But Popeye's been

331
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:20,040
doing these live streams. Oh, they're great. And so I learned a little insights recently.

332
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:26,160
You see, the they canonical referred to it as the code name during the development cycle

333
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,560
West, but as it nears release, one of the final changes is switching over to 19.10.

334
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,080
That sounds small, but it's probably a big deal. And then once it's released, it's referred

335
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,920
to as 1910. So get it right. Well, it's not out yet. No. Although if you think by the

336
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,880
time people listen to this, it probably is so don't screw him up. Right. But we I mean,

337
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,520
this is kind of our first look, right? Because it hasn't been officially released. We've

338
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,860
been playing with it though. And really, the whole crew has I think our intention is to

339
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:57,840
continue to run it for the rest of this week, and then give you a report on some extended

340
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,920
experience with some specific things next week. But we did want to give it a first look

341
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,200
this week because we have been running it. Even on our trip to Texas Cyber Summit, West

342
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:14,280
got Ubuntu Monte installed on his ThinkPad T480. And I have been running the main line

343
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,680
Ubuntu with GNOME Shell on my system. Mr. Bacon, what have you been running?

344
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,720
I was running the beta for a couple of days and then switched over to the latest daily

345
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
of Monte.

346
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,800
Ah, okay. And then Mr. Drew, are you on GNOME Shell? Are you on what? What desktop?

347
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:36,120
I started on the official Ubuntu desktop, which is, you know, they're rebranded GNOME

348
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:43,280
Shell. But then I switched over to the more bland GNOME session, just because, you know,

349
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
more comfortable there.

350
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,220
You're a Fedora guy. I know. Okay. But all right. So mainline. All right, very good.

351
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:55,340
So these are a collection of experiences. I'm going to try to sneak in some other flavors

352
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,580
over the next week and give you a more comprehensive review in the following episode, as well as

353
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:06,320
some performance testing and other things with the whole ZFS stack. But as far as our

354
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,520
first looks go, I thought, let's talk about some of the headline features. So we'll get

355
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:16,000
to GNOME Shell here in a moment, because it's really, it really, really shines in this release.

356
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,120
But I think the one that's going to get a lot of news attention is the ZFS support.

357
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:29,120
In this version of Ubuntu 19.10, ZFS version 0.8.1 is shipping with features like native

358
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,480
encryption, trimming support, checkpoints, raw encrypted ZFS transmissions, project accounting

359
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:42,060
and quota, and some back ports from 8.2 that did rocks, and I assume others determined

360
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:51,640
were appropriate. So we have a pretty solid ZFS implementation. But on top of that, there's

361
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:57,200
a lot of work that went into making the rest of the stack ZFS ready. What I'm thinking

362
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,280
of Wes is things like grub.

363
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,920
Oh, yeah, right. So there's this project called ZSYS. And the goal really is to make a lot

364
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:11,520
of the ZFS advanced in basic concepts easily accessible and transparent to anyone because

365
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,040
maybe you're a sys admin, and you're familiar with ZFS, you're like, Oh, yeah, I mean, it

366
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,360
makes sense for my big, my big pool of information, but you have the time and need to go study

367
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,860
up, review, understand how the system works. ZFS still has a number of great features.

368
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:29,200
If the software between the user and the system can help the user take advantage of those

369
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:35,320
right stuff like automated snapshots, rollbacks, offline instant updates, easy backup support

370
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:41,880
with ZFS replication, right? I mean, come on, those are all amazing features. Unfortunately,

371
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,160
desktop Linux hasn't really integrated those. Yeah, I mean, because this is an awkward spot,

372
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:51,420
right? Unless you're running the latest Ubuntu, they're all there, but nothing's really fully

373
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:56,920
incorporating them. Yeah. So that's why Canonical has been developing a new user space demon

374
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,320
called ZSYS. And it's going to cooperate with things like grub and it's got some patches

375
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,680
and better support for grub. And it's also going to interact with the standard ZFS tooling

376
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,840
to sort of smooth all the little gaps and make sure all those advanced features can

377
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,400
actually be enabled. And it's not necessarily grub dependent. However, this does mean that

378
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,740
they're shipping now a patched version of grub that lets you boot right on ZFS on root,

379
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,960
as well as support other functions. Yeah, I mean, well, as long as the installer gets

380
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,860
the system ready, you've been playing with it, Chris. Yeah. So this obviously was the

381
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:32,600
thing we wanted to really try because this is a bigger commitment than just including

382
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:38,680
ZFS in the main installation. There is software that's being patched. There's this ZSYS layer

383
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:46,040
here. And there is a lot of thought being put into pre configured data sets, if you

384
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,360
understand what ZFS is a bit. So I thought, well, let's give it a go. Because you've got

385
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:57,900
two things here. You've got the core ZFS support of Ubuntu 1910. And then you've got the installer

386
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:05,120
support. These are two separate things. And what's really brand new in 1910 is the installer

387
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,680
support in Ubiquiti. And that's what I really wanted to give that a go. And there's a couple

388
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:14,100
of limitations you need to be aware about right here right now. Number one, it's automatic

389
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:19,480
mode only. Number two, it's going to take over the entire disk. So everything on that

390
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,980
disk is going to be rewritten. Yeah, you can't install with ZFS on an existing installer

391
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,800
next to existing installs. And if you need to make customizations, well, you're going

392
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,740
to have to do that after the install is finished. The custom partitioner does not support ZFS.

393
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:37,760
So that is an after install thing. So be aware of that. Number three, and it's not a big

394
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,040
deal. But the installer is going to make it look like it's doing extended for so you just

395
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:48,240
need to be aware of that too. And that's actually because under the hood, it is using extended

396
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,680
for for some stuff and then moving it over to ZFS later. And so it just requires a lot

397
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,880
of patchwork to Ubiquiti to display it. And it just didn't make it in time for 1910. So

398
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,080
these are the caveats you need to be aware about if you want to use it. I was comfortable

399
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,600
with all of these things. My workstation here at the studio, we talked about this recently,

400
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,160
it's a pretty old install. It started life as neon 1604 ran really great, which was then

401
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:22,040
upgraded to neon 1804, which is kind of around the point I decided to try out X F C E. And

402
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:27,280
then I converted it to as Ubuntu 1804 install that also had no show installed. So I could

403
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,500
check things out on Whalen a little bit here and there. And this is gross kind of kind

404
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:37,980
of began to fall apart. But it was a it was a solid install from like 2016. So I wrote

405
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,940
it as long as I could. I thought it's at a point now where I need to reinstall. I don't

406
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:47,720
have to, but I need to. And 1910 is here. Let's do this shit. So I wipe out the whole

407
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:53,520
system after backing everything up. ZFS on route using the big, bold, all caps, experimental

408
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:59,120
option in the Ubiquiti installer. Hit that next button, rock that install option. And

409
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:06,960
I get everything installed and my goodness, it is glorious. I mean, it's fast. It's beautiful.

410
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,280
It is the fastest my computer has ever felt. And the software centers packed full of snaps

411
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:17,360
and other apps ready to go. Slack, Telegram, Chrome, slam it on my system. And I've got

412
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:24,160
an AMD GPU. So not a single proprietary driver is loaded. I am rocking this thing. Three

413
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,100
screens, two of them vertical. It's good to go. I love this. Oh, what's this, Gary? Oh,

414
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,160
this has really gotten pretty great. Look at this. It picked up my GNOME online account

415
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,440
stuff automatically. Wow, this is such an amazing experience. Well, time to go home.

416
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,720
Shut the computer down, go home, spend the night with the wife and kids, come back to

417
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:51,020
work in the morning, hit the power button, system fails to boot. Dead. This is when I

418
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,960
realized I was in a bit of a situation. So if I go into grub and I reload the previous

419
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:01,600
kernel, the one that came on the daily ISO, I could boot pretty good. Couldn't get a home

420
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,600
directory, couldn't get a VAR, but I could get the system up. If I boot on the new kernel,

421
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,360
I could get to a busy box shell and that was it. And that's when I realized that I had

422
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,400
hit a bit of a situation. You really didn't take the experimental thing seriously, did

423
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:22,400
you? I mean, I was on fire, Wes. I was on fire. And this was a hard, hard right turn

424
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,520
and I was not expecting it. And I sat with it. I thought about, you know, troubleshooting

425
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:34,440
here and there. But what I realized is I'm going to take advantage of the super solid

426
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:40,240
ZFS support that is in 1910. And I'm going to go ahead and bypass the installer support.

427
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:47,520
Root on ZFS, for me, has a lot of potential in a little while, but not a lot of potential

428
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,640
today. Do you know what I mean? Like, you could kind of visualize how that would be

429
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,560
handy. Right. I mean, we've seen other systems, things like FreeBSD, other other systems with

430
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,480
with longer ZFS support, or maybe things like OpenSUSE, right? With with ButterFS, like

431
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,080
you can get a lot of benefits with ZFS on Root, with snapshots, rollback, integration,

432
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,320
perhaps with the package manager to make sure the system stays in a consistent state. Right.

433
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,320
Could you see like a grub entry, last snapshot. So when my system fails, I just load that

434
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,200
and boom, I'm right back to where I was right before I did that update. Right. But you don't

435
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,540
really get that right now. Yeah. And you're risking a little bit of complexity. Right.

436
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:28,800
So the ZFS support in Ubuntu 1910 is top notch. The Ubiquiti installer is limited today.

437
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:34,480
So what I did on my next reload after I gave it a thought is I went get ready for this

438
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:42,680
extended for for my root XFS for my home and ZFS from my data partitions, which I just

439
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,160
set up later after the install was done with G parted and you know, just put them just

440
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,480
toss them an SFS tab and a big deal. Right. So basically, you've decided that on 1910,

441
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,500
at least, maybe just skip that setup, unless you specifically want to play with it and

442
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,640
enjoy the, you know, the consistent ZFS support we've enjoyed for a while on Ubuntu. I'm going

443
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:06,080
to give it I'm going to give the ZFS on Root a go again. But I really do he did rocks warning,

444
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,980
you know, he says this is this is legitimately an experimental thing we're doing in so much

445
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:16,600
that the format of the way we lay out the disk may change and it it may not be compatible

446
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:22,120
with what we decide to go with in the end. This is what I loved back in the day about

447
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:28,320
these interim releases of Ubuntu. They were really the try something out, try something

448
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,000
new, deploy the new desktop environment, deploy the new compositing back end, deploy the new

449
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,760
frickin file system, right? I mean, that's the only way to get some of this stuff ironed

450
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,600
out, right? I mean, you can test all you want behind closed doors, you can play with a limited

451
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,720
number of systems you have available. But until the people who are actually going to

452
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,840
use it use it, you can't fix all those books, you've got to put it in production. And that's,

453
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,520
that's what these interim releases have been about in the past. But it really feels like

454
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,080
the good old days. If you love living on the edge a little 1910 really makes you feel right

455
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,940
at home in that regard. So that's, that's where I stand with the ZFS support for my

456
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,840
production systems. For systems that I'm going to depend on from a day to day basis. I will

457
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,240
not use the ZFS on route experimental installer feature, but I am going to use the hell out

458
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,000
of the ZFS support that is there. I'm just going to use it a more traditional manner.

459
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,320
Yeah, I mean, that's still fantastic. And I expect by 2020, it'll probably be a different

460
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
story.

461
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,880
Yeah. Wimpy sounds like you perhaps had some feedback here.

462
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:35,320
Yeah, the the way that the ZFS on route is implemented changed quite a bit literally

463
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:41,000
in the last few days. And it sounds like some of you early adopters there with the daily

464
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,800
images got bitten.

465
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,500
I suspected as much.

466
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:50,420
As of yesterday, it's all fine again. It's still carrying an experimental flag for the,

467
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,520
for the reasons that you highlight, Chris, which is the implementation may change slightly

468
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,880
between 1910 and 2004 based on, you know, feedback and such and how people get on with

469
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:08,120
things. But if you know, when the final release is out, if you want to test ZFS, you shouldn't

470
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,040
run into the issues that you've just described.

471
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,440
Yeah, I would expect so. I still think maybe for my day to day production systems, I would

472
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:20,720
avoid it on route. But unlike my, my computers that are not like the end of the world, if

473
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,080
I do an update, and there's an issue, I think I'm going to give it a go again. And I obviously

474
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,600
am using it on the data partitions.

475
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,520
It's just making me excited. I'm looking forward to when this improves.

476
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,920
Yeah, I mean, this is how you get there, right? So let's talk about desktop environments for

477
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:42,720
a moment. So you spent most of your time with Matei. I spent most of my time in GNOME Shell.

478
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:52,160
From the GNOME Shell side, I would say it feels like a supercar now. Man, I am so hooked

479
00:36:52,160 --> 00:37:00,200
on the GNOME Shell setup. I mean, I've been riding pretty happily with Fedora recently.

480
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:09,600
But whoa, I mean, I got to see what Fedora's setup is. But I mean, everything is so smooth.

481
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,920
It's so fast. But more than that, and this is something that Ubuntu has always done really

482
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:20,760
well with, but good God, the fonts look great. I've been I've been working with XFCE for

483
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:29,400
quite a while. And to sit down on this computer, I get a sense of peace when I look at the

484
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,560
fonts on my screen. I know that sounds so stupid, but there's something about when they

485
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:43,280
nail it, and my mind isn't distracted by what's wrong with it. It's just perfect. That's how

486
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,240
looking at the screen feels with Ubuntu 19.10. I can't go back. And I don't know what I'm

487
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,560
going to do now about my laptop. I don't know what I'm going to do because I actually hate

488
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,200
being in this position because I don't want to base all my setup on a frickin 19.10 because

489
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,600
I got LTSs everywhere and I'm pretty happy with Fedora on the laptop. But I can't remember

490
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:09,840
the last time I've come on the air and been this enthusiastic about how something performs

491
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:19,220
and looks on my screen. The fonts are so perfect. The performance is so butter smooth. The Yaru

492
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:30,140
theme is perfect now. It just looks like a professional grade desktop theme. I like both

493
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:36,660
the light version and the dark version of it. I'm not going to change it. I'm not changing

494
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:45,960
the defaults. And that doesn't happen. I always mess with the defaults. So for me, this is

495
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:54,560
the release that brings me back to GNOME. After two years of jumping from Plasma and

496
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:02,780
then XFCE, I can't go back. I really like it. So for me, and maybe it's the time I've

497
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:07,640
spent in XFCE that makes it such a strong contrast for me, but the animations are no

498
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:13,340
longer a detraction. They are an improvement to the experience where as before I found

499
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:20,080
them distracting and aggravating. They now give the desktop a sense of direction. Things

500
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:25,220
are smooth. It's just, what about stability? Because that's been one of your problems in

501
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:30,520
the past. Yeah, I can't fully speak to that because I had to kind of nuke and pave halfway

502
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:36,960
through this for the ZFS stuff. So I will have to give you maybe more on that next week.

503
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,360
Initially pretty good. However, I do have this issue that plagues I think just DisplayPort

504
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:47,440
on Linux, because it's been an issue on Plasma. It's been an issue on XFCE. And now it's an

505
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,360
issue on GNOME Shell, where when my screens go to sleep, they just completely get crazy

506
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:57,000
because I've got two verticals and then one horizontal in the middle. Windows move around.

507
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,480
Sometimes one screen doesn't even turn on. Orientations just go crazy. And that's still

508
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,480
an issue.

509
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,480
See, the problem is you're getting up from your computer. And if you just didn't do that,

510
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,480
then you wouldn't hit this button.

511
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,200
Well, I do have a workaround. And I thought this was because I had this dirty Nvidia graphics

512
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,560
card. So then I switched over to an AMD graphics card. And I was hoping that because it was

513
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:23,960
a fresh install with no other previous drivers, just always the free AMD driver, maybe it

514
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:31,340
would... No, no, no. So my workaround is I have Caffeine installed as the extension.

515
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:35,280
So I use that during the day. So the screens just stay on during the day. And then when

516
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:42,680
the computer goes to sleep at night, I have a XRender script that I run because I'm back

517
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:49,800
on X with Ubuntu, which has been fine. So yeah, I'd love to hear your impressions of

518
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,680
Amate. And then we'll go around the horn. And I know Drew ran into a few issues, so

519
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,400
I definitely want to cover those. But I'd love to get your Amate experiences.

520
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,120
I feel like I've been on the opposite journey in some ways because I've been sticking with

521
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:07,240
KDE neon and plasma for the for the past year or so. And it's been great. It's making me

522
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,440
think about some of those animations because playing with Monte for the past week or so,

523
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,840
it's been nice. And I will say I frequently just feel like it's so snappy and quick. There's

524
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:22,080
a few areas where it's almost too quick. And, you know, it feels like there could be a little

525
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,240
animation there. So I'm not sure exactly what I want out of a desktop. It's making me question

526
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,680
a lot of things. I'm not sure I get the most benefits from all of the fixes in in Monte

527
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,000
because there's a ton of work going on for for better support of high DPI in particular,

528
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,100
and better support for Nvidia graphics and gamers. And of course, you're on Intel with

529
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:44,340
low DPI. Yeah, and I haven't tried gaming on it yet either. Right. So life pretty decent,

530
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:48,600
but battery life has been great. And even then, as someone who's deployed Monte mostly

531
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,120
for family members, you know, people with either like a need an appliance type application

532
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:58,400
or just are used to a more traditional desktop. It's the best Monte experience I've had in

533
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,440
a long time. And kind of the first time in a while I might consider using it every day.

534
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,080
When we recently talked a lot about the improvements in this 1910 release this paper cut release,

535
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:14,640
but kind of what kind of now getting to this point. When you look back at this 1910 release,

536
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,400
what's the feature for you that I think will stick with you the most? Well, there's not

537
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:31,120
one, but so I think the notification center is a big deal for me personally. And I actually

538
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:37,360
made use of it at UbuCon last week with great success. I was able to put it into do not

539
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:43,000
disturb mode. And I gave my presentation and nobody saw the telegram messages from my wife.

540
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,760
So that was a massive win. You know, it's that's a simple thing. And I've I've been

541
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:54,120
wanting that for ages. So Jason, who implemented all of that stuff, I can't thank you enough.

542
00:42:54,120 --> 00:43:01,000
You know, I really like that notification center. I think the I've got a laptop that

543
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:09,680
does well two laptops that support high DPI. So the high DPI improvements are hugely obvious

544
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,440
to me. And anyone that's got a high DPI machine and has used Marte in the past, you will immediately

545
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,780
see the improvements. And we've not finished all of those yet. We're very, very close.

546
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:23,800
We've got some more visual quality improvements to come in the next release, which will land

547
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:29,360
in time for 2004. I particularly like the fact that now we've got invisible window corners.

548
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:36,280
So you don't have to have pixel perfect, you know, grabbing on the window corners to you

549
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,320
know, seems like a simple thing turns out to be actually incredibly difficult to implement

550
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:48,680
properly. Yeah. And then the Ubuntu Marte has adopted indicators, you know, app indicators

551
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:56,280
from Ubuntu for several releases now. And this release is the first time it's really

552
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:04,120
all nailed, you know, they don't scale weirdly, they all work, the date time indicator and,

553
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:10,880
you know, interacting with evolution and everything, you know, it's just it's just lots of those

554
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,360
improvements. And then there's a ton of fixes, you know, it's just it's just, it's not perfect,

555
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,680
but we're really getting close to where we want to be now. So I'm very, very happy with

556
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:25,680
this release. Looking over Wes's shoulder, it does seem like it's been it's been really

557
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:32,400
solid. And I noticed that when we install Chromium, if you do like a pseudo apt install

558
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,840
Chromium, what is it? What's the package Chromium desktop or I can't remember the exact

559
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:43,560
package name. It kicks off a script that then installs the snap version of the package.

560
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:50,840
And seamlessly, very seamlessly. And I'm, I'm pretty impressed because that makes Chrome

561
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:55,920
and Chromium probably make some of the most sense for an application. But I did a little

562
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:02,760
digging. And I, I think this now makes it possible to install Chromium on versions of

563
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:09,080
Ubuntu that basically would no longer be able to run Chromium. And that must be applicable

564
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:15,160
to other districts to like 1404, for example. Yeah, the tricky thing here is he's not so

565
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:23,600
much running Chromium on 1404. It's actually getting the tool chain required to build Chromium

566
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:30,160
for 1404. Yeah, there's a chicken in the egg. Yeah, yeah. So you know, when, you know, if

567
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,920
you if you say 1404 is now in its extended security maintenance, and we've got 1604 and

568
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:42,600
1804 and 2004 just around the corner. So let's take 1910. For each of those four versions.

569
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:48,720
That's a separate build of Chromium that we have to build one on 1404 one on 1604 one

570
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:54,320
on 1804 one on 1910. And of course, it's 1904 as well. So there's actually five different

571
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:00,080
builds. And because the tool chains have changed tool chain has changed significantly between

572
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,480
1404 and where we are today, there's several different build configurations that you have

573
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:11,120
to manage along the way there. So by just building the snap, which runs a single build,

574
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:17,960
runs on all five of those versions of Ubuntu, plus 50 other Linux distributions, we cut

575
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:26,160
our investment in time to maintain Chromium considerably, you know, four or five times.

576
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,880
So that's the motivation for doing this with Chromium, because there's a new release every

577
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,280
six weeks, it's fast moving. And now we have a mechanism to continue to deliver it across

578
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,860
the entire family of supported Ubuntu.

579
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,400
And the the shim had been done before, right? Like things like LexD already, if you installed

580
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:49,440
the package just gave you the snap? Yes. So LexD, I think was probably the first first

581
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,720
package where we did the same thing. And for similar reasons, you know, it means you can

582
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:58,840
maintain one version of the thing rather than, you know, half a dozen. You know, when you

583
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:03,000
do something like this, which to Wes and I makes a lot of sense, especially with something

584
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,400
like Chromium, you're going to get people that react in the extreme, they're going to

585
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,880
extrapolate this to mean everything's going to snaps. And the the really sinister thing

586
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:18,200
about it is when I pseudo apt install, it's still installing a goshdarn snap. I didn't

587
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:22,640
do a snap install. I didn't apt install. Why didn't I get a DEP? And they're going to construe

588
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,960
that to mean everything's going to snaps.

589
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:32,400
Yeah. You know, obviously, there are people who will react in that way. I pasted a link

590
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:38,320
in IRC you can include in the show notes, a blog post on the Ubuntu blog that Popey

591
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:48,840
wrote that details this in some detail to explain what I've said and a few other things

592
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:58,400
in much more detail. But the plan is not to replace everything in Ubuntu with snaps. We've

593
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:05,440
done this with Chromium because we have to choose wisely how we invest our time and for

594
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:11,440
the desktop team, which is relatively small, this represents a big labor saving. And it

595
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:17,680
means we can invest our time in other improvements in in the desktop, such as you know, improving

596
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,400
the fluidity and performance of you know, gnome shell and other things.

597
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:27,080
Sure. Well, we tried it out on the Ubuntu mate install here. And I was happy to report

598
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:34,440
that we had native open and save dialog boxes. We had access to the webcam, we had WebGL.

599
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:39,840
So I mean, it was a perfectly usable, perfectly functional show from it right now. Yeah, you

600
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,880
really wouldn't know. And I think that's the type of application where they have a custom

601
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,880
toolkit like that, that is also kind of funky that sometimes you can't guarantee will look

602
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:54,240
right. And whereas this snap actually gets the right GTK theme and everything. It was

603
00:48:54,240 --> 00:49:01,520
a great experience. I'm impressed. So I think it's not bad. And I wanted to now move over

604
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:06,120
to cheese and drew because I know they both had very different experiences. So cheese,

605
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,840
why don't we start with yours? I know you spent some time with both of them. So start

606
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,720
wherever you think is probably best.

607
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:18,000
Well, let me start with saying the bare metal that I was testing it on is a potato. So it's

608
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,000
a Dell and spirit on 3147. Not much better than some of the older atom chips. So it's

609
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,600
not a very good machine. It's one of these two in ones. Initially, I tried pulling down

610
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:36,800
the GNOME version, the stock version. And for whatever reason, GNOME likes to default

611
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:42,920
with the hid gyro and hit accelerometer kernel modules and stuff like that. So again, I was

612
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:51,720
faced with a rotated 180 degrees and flipped 90 degrees login screen. So quickly ditch

613
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:57,800
that, jumped over to the mate beta, found a couple of little bugs in the installer,

614
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:03,320
which were just like VLC and Google+, which have since been fixed in the daily. They were

615
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:09,600
fixed, I think, well before I'd noticed them. Another little bug that I noticed when switching

616
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:16,600
to the Redmond theme in mate was that some of the mounted icons were pretty large. I

617
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,360
don't know why anyone would necessarily want to switch to the Redmond theme, but it's there

618
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:25,880
if you do. But that was really the only kind of graphical glitch that I saw. I did also

619
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:32,960
have, whenever I tried to use the experimental ZFS install from the installer, the installer

620
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:39,100
did crash on me, which I wasn't expecting much. And it's on this little laptop.

621
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:44,200
And it's also still in the development cycle. So when we do this phase of the first look,

622
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:49,040
like that kind of stuff is expected. We'll do our follow up thoughts next week.

623
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:54,440
We went through several days with the ZFS install not functioning on the dailies. So

624
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,280
we know that's fixed now.

625
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,800
Yeah. And when you do like a regular like extended four or whatever, it's totally fine.

626
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:08,680
But my overall experience was really great. And mate works great on that older hardware.

627
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:13,840
You know, I haven't had any real issues with it. I love that I'm given the choice now between

628
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:18,760
the full install and the minimal installs. So immediately, you know, I picked up on that.

629
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:24,400
I love how mate gives me a welcome screen. Just a nerd like that, because I think anyone

630
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,880
that's going to be new to a system coming from Windows or Mac or something like that,

631
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,000
that's going to give them kind of that little extra help.

632
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Nothing beats the boutique.

633
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,840
Yeah, dude, it's great. So I've had overall a really good experience with it. You know,

634
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,680
I will likely keep running it. And then once the final version comes out, I'll switch to

635
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:50,960
the final, played some installed steam, played some steam games, ran great. I have also heard

636
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:58,920
issues with people that have had their audio inputs or output switch from HDMI to their

637
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:04,200
USB headset. And I'm guessing that's just something on enumerating. I loved watching

638
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,800
Popeys live stream the other day where he installed to live. I noticed what was really

639
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,880
cool about that. And thanks, Popey, because now I'm in the land of looking for ThinkPads.

640
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:20,200
Oh, my God, you got him going on ThinkPads for like a solid few minutes. It was I never

641
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,720
I mean, you see you want to see Popey light up asking about things.

642
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,560
I know I'm waiting on him to like one day just lay them all out around him and just

643
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,800
go through each one and talk about it. That'd be a great video.

644
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,440
I know. I know. I actually think it's a problem.

645
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:39,920
I think the Linux and ThinkPads, it's like hand in hand. I mean, it's not a problem.

646
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:45,040
Cheesha, not alone. The number of people that are in the Ubuntu podcast telegram channel

647
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:50,920
exchanging notes about ThinkPads, they're buying on eBay. You know, Popey needs to be

648
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:56,200
on commission. I think there's going to be no ThinkPads left on eBay as a result of these

649
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,200
live streams.

650
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:02,360
Absolutely. All the off lease ThinkPads have been bought up now in the last two weeks.

651
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,840
But I did notice I think he was on the 220, the X220 or the X240. I don't remember which

652
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,840
one he was using.

653
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,840
It was the 220.

654
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,440
Okay, the fingerprint scanner works out of the box now.

655
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:18,040
Oh, yeah. I've got news about fingerprint scanners. Yeah. Go on. Go on. Yes. Yeah. So

656
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:25,880
that was something that happened in the 1904 cycle and has been improved in the 1910 cycle.

657
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:34,360
And it's still the case that the more modern biometric chips used in fingerprint scanners

658
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:44,520
are not supported by fprintd because they have, you know, a proprietary driver effectively.

659
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:52,600
And fprintd will only talk to an open driver. So I don't know when we're going to conclude

660
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:58,360
this work. But I was talking to my colleague Marco about this over the weekend. And he

661
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:05,360
was saying that he's got the fingerprint reader working on I think it's the T480 or something

662
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:12,720
like that. And he's written a shim that wraps around the proprietary driver. So fprintd

663
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:18,720
can talk to it. And he was showing me this because I was saying, oh, yeah, problem isn't

664
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:26,320
none of the new ones work. And then he unlocked his laptop with his fingerprint reader. So

665
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,560
I'm not quite sure what the scheduling is around that. But I know it's something we're

666
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:35,600
working towards. Is there a you don't have to say who, but is there a is there an enterprise

667
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:41,360
client that's driving this need? Because this seems this seems like, ah, yes, it seems like

668
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,440
that's one of those things. Well, good. That's what I love about open source. One particular

669
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,080
really important enterprise client can drive something that the rest of us benefit from.

670
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:55,280
And my final note would be, you know, big congrats to the whole team over there, what

671
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:01,480
they've managed to do, especially with 15 year anniversary. You know, right, right here

672
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:08,180
on us last week, makes me feel super old. But I know I'm proud to be, you know, a user

673
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:11,560
of Ubuntu and have been for a long time. And I really appreciate all the hard work you

674
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:16,080
guys do. Yeah, I think you're you're really nailing it with the 15 years like this is

675
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:23,840
this is amazing. And here we are back on GNOME two. All right, so Drew had had a go. And

676
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:27,680
what I love about Drew's perspective on this is he had a chance to really kind of look

677
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,440
at it from a production grade workstation desktop. And some things were great, and some

678
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:37,240
things weren't so great. So what did you run into? And what was good? And what wasn't good,

679
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:46,080
right? So the standard desktop experience was phenomenal. As you saw, the speed improvements

680
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:51,580
and all of the animation improvements and everything that's gone into both the GNOME

681
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:57,960
version and the Ubuntu desktop, you know, skin of the GNOME version are great. They

682
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:06,320
are doing wonderful work there. Everything is smooth and just buttery and really, really

683
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:12,980
a joy to use. And as far as stability, you know, I've been using it a little longer than

684
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:20,520
you have. I've been running it for about a week on the beta. And I haven't had any crashes

685
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:28,320
or really any issues under normal workstation use cases. The only time that I've had issues

686
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:35,880
is when I start to go into pro audio land. And there I did have some problems on my laptop

687
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:43,440
specifically when I would load up Jack and start using my audio interface, which is connected

688
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:51,040
via USB. Every now and then, and I never figured out what triggered it, it would just drop

689
00:56:51,040 --> 00:57:00,480
the USB connection and switch over to the internal sound card. So not great. And I did,

690
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,000
just because this is a production machine for me, go back to Fedora on this one, and

691
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,800
I haven't had it happen again. So I don't think it's a hardware issue. I don't think

692
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:13,920
it's an issue with the interface, but something either in Ubuntu studio controls or something

693
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:22,120
in the USB subsystem is causing some interrupt on that. Other than that, that's really, I

694
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:28,760
mean, that's the only issue that I've really had. I will say that I tried a bunch of snaps

695
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:34,660
as well, just to see how that's coming along. And I do think that snap support is getting

696
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:40,760
a lot better every time I look at it. They are still launching a little slower than I'd

697
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:48,720
like, but I know that's still being worked on. And realistically for application support,

698
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:56,620
I think snaps and Flatpak are both really great ways to deliver standard desktop applications.

699
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:01,200
I'm not sold on it for low-level stuff yet, but I'm getting there.

700
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:07,760
Yeah. I completely agree with your assessment. They're really solid now, including the open

701
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,340
and save dialog boxes, looking right, getting access to your individual devices without

702
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:17,620
making it a battle. But it's really down to the launch time. It's still not quite where

703
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:22,120
I'd like it to be. Now, the nice thing with something like Chromium is I launch it pretty

704
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:29,760
much once a day, and then it's open all day long. But I can kind of see the groundwork

705
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,960
for 2004, you know what I mean?

706
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:40,420
Yeah, absolutely. And this looks so much like an interim release between 1904 and 2004.

707
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:46,640
It's just crazy. You see all of the work that went into 1904, polished up, made better,

708
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:54,120
and some other iterative improvements on top of that. Going into the 2004 stretch, it really

709
00:58:54,120 --> 00:59:00,440
looks like it's shaping up to make just a real killer LTS when that comes around. I'm

710
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,880
really excited about that.

711
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:07,160
Yeah, that's my take too. And I look at it, I mean, this is a stupid, bad, horrible analogy

712
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:13,440
that I shouldn't make, but I kind of look at 1910 as a bit of, you know, it's a fun

713
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:18,380
mod car. It's a race car, it's super fast, but sometimes the turbo's a little too powerful

714
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:23,360
and you blow a bolt. And the LTS is like, it's your commuter car. It's your safe, predictable,

715
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,400
it's going to turn every time you...

716
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,400
It's your Volvo.

717
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,760
Yeah, it really is just like a really predictable, reliable car. And that's where the LTS is.

718
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:37,320
And it depends on which type of driver you are. Do you like to have a little fun? And

719
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:42,400
maybe sometimes drive a little too fast? Then maybe 1910s for you. Do you want to know that

720
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,880
every single day you're going to get to your destination? Then the LTS is for you. That's

721
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:52,160
kind of standard advice, but it is more applicable with the 1910 release than I think it's been

722
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:57,920
for a few years. And it's really something to see where we're at now with Gnome Shell

723
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,480
and where we're at now with Snaps. These have all been these concepts that we've been building

724
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:08,960
to and we've been seeing get implemented over time. And 1910 is a representation of what

725
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:15,240
I think Canonical had as a long-term vision. It's really close in 1910. We're not a hundred

726
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:21,520
percent yet, but we're really close. And so if you're interested in that at all, it's

727
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:28,600
worth checking out. Now, which flavors for you? Is ZFS slower? Is there other kind of

728
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:36,040
overhead costs with ZFS like memory usage compared to XFS and extended for? That I can't

729
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:40,800
tell you fully yet. That's something we're going to spend the next week investigating,

730
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:46,640
benchmarking, and we'll follow up. Now that 1910 is going to be officially released, we'll

731
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,720
follow up with some of that stuff. Give some of those things a try.

732
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,000
I'm thinking I might give Kubuntu a try.

733
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:01,240
Yeah. Kubuntu 1910 looks particularly good as well. I think I'm tempted to also try that.

734
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,920
And then before you know it, the new Fedora is going to be out. It's too much, Wes.

735
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,260
And then you're looking at like when 2024 makes it, it's going to be a nice supported

736
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:11,680
release too. So it's just a great time to be a desktop Linux user.

737
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,520
It's true. Oh, hold on. A production note here from the back office. They're telling

738
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,280
us to move on. It's time to mention the picks. Should we do that?

739
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,760
Let's do it. We got some great picks today.

740
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:25,760
Well, I moved over to a Gnome shell and I realized there wasn't a great menu editor

741
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,080
built in. Like basically all of the other desktops, you just right click on the menu

742
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:34,840
and you can edit it. Gnome's like, no, no, we don't got that for you. So I have two different

743
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:41,280
picks for you. I have this problem with my monitors that I gripe about on occasion. And

744
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,240
you can install an application called, what is it, A-Rander, which just gives you like

745
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,240
these really...

746
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:48,240
X-Rander.

747
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,560
Well, A-Rander uses X-Rander to create scripts for X-Rander.

748
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:56,040
Just like a nice little desktop. You lay out the screens how you want. It gives you the

749
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,040
script.

750
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,400
But then you have this problem where like you want to be able to launch super easy because

751
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,920
your screens are all screwed up and you'd like a single click or a command you can execute.

752
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:08,120
Well, that's where making a desktop file comes in and adding it to your menu. And my friends,

753
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:11,800
if you have ever wanted to add something to your menu, to your launcher, this is where

754
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:18,680
menu Libre comes in from Sean M. Davis. It's a menu editor, straightforward basic menu

755
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:24,040
editor that works on anything that follows the standard. Also a shout out to app editor.

756
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:31,680
If you are on elementary OS, this is a nice looking menu editor that I'd love to have

757
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,560
on every other desktop, but that's in the App Center. And either one of these two applications

758
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:40,200
depending on what fits your needs, allow you to add things that you can then search by

759
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:46,600
hitting the super key either on Plasma or Mate or Gnome Shell or Xfce, anything that

760
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,800
follows this free desktop standard for the.desktop file.

761
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,560
That's great because otherwise it's kind of like black magic to me and I don't want to

762
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,560
go messing with those files.

763
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:54,560
Yeah.

764
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,560
I can just...

765
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,320
How do you get stuff in that launcher? How do you make it searchable? How does this work?

766
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:02,840
I got a shell script, I want to be able to search for it and execute it. This pick will

767
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:09,280
help you do that. So check the show notes for that, linuxunplug.com slash 323. But then

768
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,240
Mr. Bacon coming in with the last minute sneaky pick.

769
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,240
He did sneak in there.

770
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,480
He's got a sneaky pick. So tell us about Wavemon.

771
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:24,120
So Wavemon is one of those curses apps that I previously used to use all the time. I found

772
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:29,920
myself using it at Texas Linux Fest just to kind of check it out. But basically it'll

773
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:35,960
allow you to monitor your wireless networking via Inker. This gives you a nice little output,

774
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:42,280
letting you know what your signal is, letting you know your throughput, what your rate is,

775
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:47,480
what your drop rate is, letting you know what channels you're on, all those sorts of things,

776
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:51,960
all those little details that you might need to know, especially if you're doing any other

777
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:58,760
sort of wireless work. So I would highly recommend checking out Wavemon. Beemon is also another,

778
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:02,880
which is a bandwidth monitor, another tool that I quite frequently used to use all the

779
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,600
time. But Wavemon's a great one.

780
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:10,440
Are we throwing in Kismet too? Who just literally threw in Kismet here in the last second?

781
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,440
Did somebody throw in Kismet?

782
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,440
Drew, did you do that?

783
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,440
Yes.

784
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,440
Nice.

785
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,440
All right, let's do Kismet.

786
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:22,480
I just wanted to point out that there's Kismet as well. Kismet is also for monitoring wireless

787
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:28,280
interfaces, but it's more along the lines of long-term monitoring. So you can set up

788
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:35,520
like little nodes in various spots. I used to use them for businesses where we'd have

789
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:41,920
to make sure that Wi-Fi was solid every single square inch of the place. So throw little

790
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:48,080
sensors around and then monitor them with Kismet and make sure that everything was up

791
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:52,840
and running properly. So if you need something with a little more power and a little more

792
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:56,000
long-term monitoring in mind, Kismet's a good choice too.

793
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,560
Sounds like my house could use that.

794
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:03,920
Yeah. Four picks, the quad picks. How about that? Also, I got to take a moment. I got

795
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,560
to take a minute. Well, not really, but I got to take a moment and I got to say...

796
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,600
Maybe like 40 seconds? I don't know.

797
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:15,360
How great has Drew done on Choose Linux? We hired Drew as an editor and then when the

798
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:23,720
situation arrived, he stepped up to Choose Linux and between him, Elle, and Joe, it has

799
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,360
turned out so great. Drew, you have done so well.

800
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,360
I love it.

801
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,640
I just want to take a moment here because I don't know how many people listen to this

802
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:35,600
show have checked you out on Choose Linux, but if you enjoy Drew on this show, he's really

803
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,600
at home on the Choose Linux show now. So go check out Choose Linux as well.

804
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:44,680
It often brings the much-needed voice of reason, I would say. I mean, Joe's sat in his ways

805
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:50,800
sometimes and Elle's a very passionate person. Drew, you just get it right. That's my personal

806
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,800
take.

807
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:57,660
I'll take it and I appreciate it. Yeah. Anybody who has any interest in Linux, I highly encourage

808
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:02,080
you to take a listen. We've got a new episode coming out soon.

809
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:08,560
I always do. Also, go check out Wimpy over at the Ubuntu podcast, the ubuntupodcast.org.

810
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:13,320
That is a staple of my week. I love every single episode. It's like hanging out with

811
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,320
friends, Wimpy.

812
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,320
Aw, thank you very much.

813
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:18,600
Thank you. Thank you for doing it. It's really nice to have you all back together now for

814
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,000
a few episodes. It feels like we're back at home now. Everything's good.

815
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

816
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,080
It's nice and solid. Yeah. Something's going to change now, I know it. I just know it.

817
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,080
It is.

818
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:33,600
Dang it. I totally call it. All right. Well, I think that wraps us up, though. We'll move

819
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:39,880
on to getting to testing, benchmarking, and just living with Ubuntu 19.10 on a day-to-day

820
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:46,880
basis. We'd love to hear your experiences as we conclude our review next week. So tweet

821
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,440
me. I'm at chrisles. The show is at Linux Unplugged?

822
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:54,040
I don't know. The network is at Jupyter Signal.

823
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:58,180
You can also tweet Wes. He's at Wes Payne. And Cheese, what are you at? Cheese Bacon,

824
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,180
for God's sake?

825
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:00,180
At Cheese Bacon.

826
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:04,000
That's like a contact page, right? LinuxUnplugged.com slash contact.

827
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
You're kidding me.

828
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Yeah, for real.

829
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,400
No. No. And then that would be a way to have a long-form response?

830
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,360
Oh, yeah. If you want to ramble in an email, don't go on too long, just for our sake, because

831
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,360
Chris isn't going to read it.

832
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:24,080
Wow. You hostile Wes. Are you noticing this? All right. Well, that's true. You're right

833
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,080
about that.

834
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:28,120
All right. One more thing before we get out of here. A little news flash.

835
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,920
Oh, wait, wait. Do you want? Hold on.

836
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,960
Do you have a news flash soundboard clip?

837
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:34,960
Of course you do.

838
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,800
Yeah. I mean, if you're coming at me with that, we're going to do it properly. Are you

839
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,800
ready?

840
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,800
I'm ready.

841
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,360
This is CNN breaking news.

842
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,360
It's cheese breaking news.

843
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:47,660
So, at the beginning of the show, we were talking about Core Boot, and I reached out

844
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:53,280
to Emma and I asked her about the plans for Core Boot on future machines. And she has

845
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:58,360
sent back to me that there are no plans to go backwards on their open hardware software

846
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:05,680
mission. So, it's safe to assume that they will be building 100% Core Boot, Daughters,

847
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:10,280
and Galagos in the foreseeable future.

848
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,440
That is great news.

849
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,440
Wow.

850
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:15,840
That is great news. Thank you for the real time follow up right there. I appreciate that.

851
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:19,560
That is so, so cool to hear. Let's end it right there on that good news. We can't top

852
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:23,400
it. Join us live, won't you? We'd love to hear your thoughts. You can always get right

853
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:28,120
in our ear holes by getting in the mumble room. All the details are in our IRC room

854
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:35,080
at IRC.geekshed.net pound hashtag Jupiter broadcasting. And then once you're in there,

855
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:40,760
you can just do bang, that's exclamation mark, mumble and it will give you all of the

856
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,720
info you need to jump in our mumble room and share your thoughts or you can share them

857
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,640
in the IRC room. Don't worry.

858
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,400
Every Tuesday. So, just set that aside.

859
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:51,880
If you can't make it next Tuesday, don't worry. We'll be back every single Tuesday

860
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:57,480
over at jblive.tv and then your RSS feed at linuxunplug.com slash subscribe. We'll see

861
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:24,760
you back here next Tuesday.

862
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:45,080
Well, there you have it. JBtitles.com. Let's go title. You guys remember that archive.org

863
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:51,320
has them emulators? They added a whole bunch of more games, eh Cheesy?

864
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,560
Yeah, so they added 2500 more games.

865
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,560
What?

866
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,560
What?

867
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,560
That's too many.

868
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:01,080
That's too many games in your browser. So super cool. I thought, you know, poppy and

869
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:05,960
wimpy also might appreciate that since they're retro gamers. And then doing a little more

870
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,960
digging.

871
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,960
Wait, did you just call them old?

872
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:12,360
Old school gamers. Old school gamers.

873
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,320
It doesn't matter which way you dice it, it's kind of accurate, right?

874
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:23,960
It is. Well, and this is coming from a dude who's old too, so. But I also ran across Exodos,

875
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:30,440
which you can pull down their torrent and they're 7000 DOS games. I'm assuming a lot

876
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:35,480
of these 2500 that were pushed up to archive.org are there if you wanted to play them in your

877
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:41,960
own DOS box. But they've already been configured to work under DOS box. So they're freeware

878
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:47,520
shareware games that I've guessed just have eventually gone free. So take a look at those

879
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,760
if you want to get your old school gaming on for sure.

880
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,560
You guys are good for the rest of the show, right? Because I know what I'm doing with

881
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:54,560
the rest of my day.

882
01:10:54,560 --> 01:11:02,040
Can I admit something? I have gotten into something that is shameful. And it's I blame

883
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:08,640
the algorithm. I blame YouTube. So back in the day, I back in the early I don't know

884
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,360
whatever it was 90s or whatever I played this game. It was my it was the it was the game

885
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:18,760
that really drew me in. And it was called Star Trek the 25th anniversary. It's one of

886
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:21,640
those games I started playing at 8pm. And then I looked up at the clock the next time

887
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:26,760
and it was 3am. And I'd been playing all night. And I found this dude who has been playing

888
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:35,640
them online in 35 minute increments. And I'm like on part 12 of his journey of playing

889
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,400
this game at 35 minutes at a time.

890
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,800
Do the multiplication there.

891
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:46,000
It's so bad was so I maybe I'll take a break and I'll go check out archive.org. Cuz I think

892
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,900
I think I don't know it feels like after a while it's like what am I doing with myself?

893
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:55,000
But what I do is I put it up while I'm working. You know, so I'm working away. Got myself

894
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,760
a little extension for Firefox so I can do video picture and picture for YouTube and

895
01:11:58,760 --> 01:11:59,760
I just go to work.

896
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,680
I will admit I'm browsing the list right now.

897
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:06,360
What I like to that they all fire up within the browser. So it's all emulated within the

898
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:12,160
browser. I'm not sure what they're doing there to do that. But this might also be the moment

899
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:19,160
you want to set up an emergency hotkey. So when your boss walks in, my boss, my boss

900
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,760
Yeah, I think you gotta worry about your boss.
