1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
It's been a while since we've done a Kickstarter

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,800
on the show here.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,640
This is AI War 2, it has 696 backers.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,960
They're going for quite a bit of money.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah, they're only 10%.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,840
Yeah, they're going for like $300,000

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,200
and they've only got 29K,

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,080
but they still have 29 days to go.

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,440
I wasn't so sure about this one.

10
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,860
And then I watched the video and I think I'm all in.

11
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,160
Plus also day one Linux support, they claim,

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,600
which I'm a big fan of, so check this out.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,080
Okay, when did you last feel proud of winning a game?

14
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,120
AI War can be that game.

15
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,240
Your fleets are surrounded deep in enemy territory.

16
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,980
Come out of nowhere, strike,

17
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,360
and then disappear back to your own planet.

18
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,680
But do not get cocky.

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,240
Look, you're trying not to be noticed

20
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,080
and an easy target isn't always a smart target.

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,260
The AI essentially plays a board game like RISC.

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,440
You're playing a grand strategic RTS.

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,280
I love it.

24
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,120
If the AI ever decides you're a big enough threat,

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,080
you're dead.

26
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,600
So you basically lay low.

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,440
You lay low.

28
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,840
Wait, the first AI War?

29
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,720
Well, you already know all that.

30
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,880
So what's new?

31
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,560
Well, there's better performance,

32
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,760
better networking, better multi-threading.

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,360
We're adding modability.

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,920
The graphics are better and they're in 3D.

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,000
And they actually perform better.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,720
We're cleaning up the UI

37
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,440
and making sure that you can tweak or mod it.

38
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,000
We've even added technologies

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,240
that let you customize your ships.

40
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,740
The sense of scale is much larger.

41
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,920
Isolated planets, well, they've now become solar systems.

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,320
Lonely units, well, they're now squads.

43
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,280
This thing is pretty neat.

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,040
They just took everything up to 11.

45
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,640
And something tells me that crowdfunding

46
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,240
may be a bigger topic in today's episode

47
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,720
of The Unplugged Show.

48
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,440
So with that, let's get started.

49
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,200
This is Linux Unplugged episode 166

50
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,520
for October 11th, 2016.

51
00:01:48,520 --> 00:02:00,760
Welcome to Linux Unplugged,

52
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,440
your weekly Linux talk show

53
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,320
that's feeling a little negative

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,680
in the freedom dimension.

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,640
My name is Chris.

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,480
My name is Wes.

57
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,320
Hello, Mr. Wes.

58
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,160
Hello.

59
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,120
This is negative.

60
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,360
We have a great show today.

61
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,360
There's gonna be a theme that you might notice

62
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,400
that'll just sort of pop up

63
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,840
as we roll through. Look what we did.

64
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,360
And of course, we've got our open source project update,

65
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,300
some big news.

66
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,480
I'm really excited to talk to some of our old friends

67
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,320
to cover a few big accomplishments.

68
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,880
There is a Whalen story tucked in here

69
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,840
that I'm excited about.

70
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,360
But also, let's get real.

71
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,640
Will you get real with me for a moment?

72
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,480
Can we get real? I'll try.

73
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,320
Let's do it.

74
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,840
We're gonna have to talk about Mate.

75
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,920
Things are changing here.

76
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,820
Things are going big.

77
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,720
Big league.

78
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,540
Momentum.

79
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,380
Huge.

80
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,080
I think there's actually a legitimate transition,

81
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,240
not to just joke around about it,

82
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,320
but I think there's actually

83
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,520
something massive happening here.

84
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,920
I wanna talk about it today.

85
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,120
Also, later on in the show,

86
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,520
we're gonna run some interviews

87
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,400
with an individual named Andy.

88
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,720
And Andy will talk about how his company

89
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,400
generates new leads by fixing bugs in open source.

90
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,980
So they submit bug patches,

91
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,360
they see their names on that bug patch,

92
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,480
and oh, I gotta work with that company,

93
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,920
and they end up getting consulting business.

94
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,200
It's a new way to make money with open source

95
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,480
that's a lot like the old way,

96
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,360
with a few tweaks, using large-scale projects.

97
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,600
We'll talk about it in today's Unplugged.

98
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,320
So there will be a lot to cover.

99
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,080
But before we go any further,

100
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,180
it is our duty to bring in that virtual log,

101
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,300
time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

102
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,140
Happy Christmas.

103
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,960
Greetings, Mumble Room.

104
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,800
Hey, Mumble Room.

105
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,640
Hello.

106
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,480
Happy Christmas.

107
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,300
Hey!

108
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,140
Yes, hello, everybody.

109
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,400
And some of them are joining us in a beer,

110
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,800
and we are drinking today vanilla cream.

111
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,260
Lights out.

112
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,760
An extra stout.

113
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,600
This is a hell of a beer, Wes.

114
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,140
It is a little bit extra.

115
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,980
It is a little extra.

116
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,200
I have these 7.7%.

117
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,280
And you know, that vanilla cream makes it nice and smooth.

118
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,800
So it's really a very drinkable beer.

119
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,440
Mr. Pope, you'll be drinking a Christmas beer,

120
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,440
and we'll be drinking a vanilla cream.

121
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,640
Let me just have another one.

122
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,320
From Bend, Oregon, too.

123
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,160
So it's another.

124
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,000
Just our neighbors in the South.

125
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,480
You have yet to bring,

126
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,520
you've only brought local beer so far.

127
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,520
I think there was one exception that was in Wyoming.

128
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,360
Oh, really?

129
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,240
There's that Melvin, which was very good.

130
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,080
I like Wyoming, so we'll allow it.

131
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,920
We'll let that slide, yeah.

132
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,180
We will allow it, yeah.

133
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,880
There is much to cover today,

134
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,960
and I wanna start with one of the interesting updates.

135
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,160
And it really required a huge investment

136
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,600
here on the Unplugged program.

137
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,120
We had to put in a lot of extra wiring,

138
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,360
additional conduit.

139
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,200
It's a mess.

140
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,080
And unfortunately, if everything works as planned,

141
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,040
the next few moments of the show may be absolutely silent,

142
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,560
but it's imperative that we get an update

143
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,400
from a friend of the show,

144
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,380
so we're gonna introduce a new feature,

145
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,220
the cone of silence.

146
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,440
The cone of silence.

147
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,260
Ooh.

148
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,640
Come on, Mr. Ike, step into the cone here.

149
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,480
How do you do?

150
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,300
Hello, sir.

151
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,140
Welcome back to the show.

152
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,840
It's been a little while.

153
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,960
It has indeed, and I apologize in advance,

154
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,920
but my voice is almost completely gone.

155
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,880
Yeah, it's kind of adorable.

156
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,700
We'll forgive you.

157
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,820
You're kind of adorable like that.

158
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,240
So I constructed this cone of silence.

159
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,260
I don't think any, it's just us.

160
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,540
Nobody can hear us in here.

161
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,400
And I wanted to get a little update

162
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,980
on what you guys are doing over on the Soulless Project.

163
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,920
I noticed some back and forth on Twitter about the Patreon,

164
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,840
and I noticed some back and forth about ISOs.

165
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,960
What's going on over there,

166
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,400
and what secrets do you want to just share between you and I?

167
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,680
So this is what we agreed on Twitter earlier on,

168
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,840
like nobody else can hear us, and this is not recorded.

169
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,660
Did you not hear?

170
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,500
I have the cone of silence.

171
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,320
It's the cone of silence.

172
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,160
This is a private, personal moment.

173
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,000
Just us three.

174
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,480
It's completely confidential.

175
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,320
There's three of us now.

176
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,140
Okay.

177
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,980
Oh, yeah.

178
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,820
I snuck in under the coat.

179
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,680
And I think Josh might have gotten a key, too.

180
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,640
Right, I think so.

181
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,040
Yeah, but.

182
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,040
Okay, so the room's getting bigger, but okay.

183
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,760
Either way, it's totally private.

184
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,760
Recently, we've been building up to the 1.2.1 release,

185
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,520
and I know for a lot of people by now,

186
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,800
they're probably thinking 1.2.1

187
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,560
has got to be phantomware by now, but it is happening,

188
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,520
and now we're got into the last 10%,

189
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,240
and the last 10% is always the hardest.

190
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,400
That 90% before, you know, you race through that.

191
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,440
You're generating news all the time.

192
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,400
So the most recent news for us over the last few days,

193
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,560
mainly last night, actually,

194
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,760
I finished up LVM2, an encryption support and installer,

195
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,740
which is something that people have been requesting

196
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,120
for a long time.

197
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,600
So now in the Solus installer,

198
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,480
we can do full disk encryption automatically for them.

199
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,800
Oh, that's great.

200
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,840
Yeah, which is like LVM2 on top of looks.

201
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,200
It's very, very simple.

202
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,920
They can choose to use LVM2,

203
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,040
and then they can choose to additionally encrypt it as well.

204
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,880
That's awesome.

205
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,720
So that literally landed just last night,

206
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,000
and about five or six o'clock this morning,

207
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,200
I actually finished the encryption support.

208
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,040
So it was a bit of a late night.

209
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,240
And while you're sick, nonetheless, too.

210
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,280
Yeah, I mean, it was easier to do that

211
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,800
than to deal with being sick, to be honest with you.

212
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,280
Boy, isn't that the truth.

213
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,960
How are you feeling like the crowdfunding's going

214
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,800
in Patreon?

215
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,060
You know, it's something we've been talking about here

216
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,560
behind the scenes a lot.

217
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,760
And I've been more and more worried

218
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,480
that it might not be the right platform for a large project,

219
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,080
even, you know, a project that wants to become large one day.

220
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,760
What are your experiences so far?

221
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,240
Well, I think I'm gonna have to agree with you there.

222
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,080
I mean, we've had Patreon for a long while.

223
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,880
At the moment, I think it's hovering just over 550 bucks

224
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,280
a month or something.

225
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,160
Now, that's been running up for a few months.

226
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,080
So basically, I didn't take anything out from it

227
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,600
for about five or six months now,

228
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,680
just to let it build up, you know, like a rainy day fund.

229
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,720
And at the moment, there's like 2,500 in there.

230
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,400
So you can kind of see the picture

231
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,800
that it does fluctuate quite a lot.

232
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,840
And, you know, it gets to the end of the month,

233
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,280
and then suddenly 15, 20 pledges have gone.

234
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,560
So it's not a reliable source of income at all.

235
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,600
And 550 or whatever it is at the moment,

236
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,240
it's not gonna cut it, you know, yourself.

237
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,600
So, I mean, it's been funded out in my own pocket now

238
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,560
for a very long time.

239
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,840
So that's servers, that's even my electric for,

240
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,520
you know, I'm running like a big Xeon server

241
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,600
under my desk here as well.

242
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,800
We got several servers, we got the websites, SSL certificates.

243
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,760
And then there's the hardware as well.

244
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,360
So by no means does it cover it,

245
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,280
but it's kind of one of those ones with Solus.

246
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,760
We never set out to be financially successful.

247
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,960
It's just, well, there was a comment on Twitter

248
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,480
earlier on because I was very surprised,

249
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,080
but oh my God, Ubuntu actually put a post up asking

250
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,440
about the future of Linux desktop and was it Solus?

251
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,800
Which was a bit of a jaw hit the floor moment.

252
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,680
It's like, that's all my God, Ubuntu.

253
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,720
But then someone said, they put it there very well,

254
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,480
is that Solus is now mainstream.

255
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,280
It's like, you're kind of right.

256
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,800
It's not like Solus was a year ago

257
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,040
where nobody knew what it was.

258
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,800
You know, everyone kind of knows what Solus is now.

259
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,760
They've all heard about it.

260
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,520
So it's one of the more mainstream Linux distributions.

261
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,400
Everyone knows it's for the desktop.

262
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,240
It's always-

263
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,600
It sure has happened fast though.

264
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,440
Yeah, I mean, a lot faster than we intended it to,

265
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,960
to be honest with you.

266
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,760
So that's why we have to add things now.

267
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Is there, I guess, do you want to just do a plug

268
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,000
for the Patreon right here, since we just mentioned it,

269
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,560
since we might as well if people are curious

270
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,480
about the project, where do they go?

271
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,880
Yeah, I mean, if people go to patreon.com forward slash

272
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,120
solus, then you can support one of us poor little devs,

273
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,000
you know, like we get locked in the cage

274
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,880
and we get abused thoroughly.

275
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,400
So just a few dollars a month and you'll help us

276
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,960
to keep the lights on.

277
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,840
Yeah, all right.

278
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,680
I relinquished-

279
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,520
The Cone of Silence.

280
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,360
The Cone of Silence.

281
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,180
It's done.

282
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,020
Back Bumble Room.

283
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,800
Wimpy, I kind of wanted to ask you too,

284
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,240
if you don't mind commenting on your thoughts

285
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,360
on Patreon as a source for funding an open source project.

286
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,500
So I picture that maybe the potential audience member

287
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,960
being somebody who has a project they're working on

288
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,000
that does have a set amount of users

289
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,320
that does have a certain cost to run it

290
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,120
and they want to keep it going and keep it sustainable.

291
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,660
How's your experience been with Patreon?

292
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,240
Yeah, Patreon has been a positive experience

293
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,240
and certainly is responsible for about 50% of the money

294
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,480
that gets invested into Ubuntu Marte.

295
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,320
Oh, wow.

296
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,000
And then there's the PayPal supporters.

297
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,960
There's between three and 400 people

298
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,320
giving some money each month.

299
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,360
And then we've got some corporate sponsorship

300
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,800
on top of that as well.

301
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,400
Yeah, so it's part of a blend.

302
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,280
But the Patreon is the amount that you can actually rely on

303
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,120
because you know month to month what's going to be coming in.

304
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,000
And that has been essential in supporting the project

305
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
when we went through a very popular period

306
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,040
where we were paying for all of our hosting and bandwidth

307
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,280
and that was expensive.

308
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,000
The Patreon got us through that.

309
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,080
Now we've got the sponsorship with Bytemark.

310
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,800
All of that money can be pushed towards funding development

311
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
projects now.

312
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,720
And so that's the thing I'm most excited about now

313
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,160
as we, this month is the last month

314
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,560
that we have any overhead

315
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,680
from our previous hosting platform

316
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,440
and we can benefit fully from the Bytemark sponsorship.

317
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,640
So that means that the full crowdfunding

318
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,320
or nearly the full crowdfunding,

319
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,240
there's a few odds and ends that we have to pay for,

320
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,040
but a lot of the crowdfunding can now go towards development.

321
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,680
Yeah, that's, I think that's an interesting way to look at it

322
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,640
as it's an important part of a blend overall.

323
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,840
And it's definitely like it's the number you can see

324
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,200
that you're gonna, you have a good estimation.

325
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,040
I mean, there's gonna be some,

326
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,800
there's gonna be probably some declines,

327
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,360
but you've got a good estimation of what you're facing.

328
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,200
Maybe like a little bit.

329
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,800
Fluctuation month to month, you get an idea, yeah.

330
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,520
And like Heike said, you know, keep some money in reserve

331
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,440
for unexpected expenses.

332
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,560
Well, let's remember this conversation

333
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,480
when we get to the Matei update

334
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,720
coming on a little bit later in the show.

335
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,320
But before somebody freaks out in the chat room,

336
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,440
we're gonna do a gaming update

337
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,520
because the chat room's losing their crap right now.

338
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,080
Oh my gosh, Wes, they're having a panic attack in there.

339
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,560
It's not our fault, Gabe's been pressuring us, so.

340
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,040
Mad Max is actually shipping on Linux in the world.

341
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,760
I believe it's called, maybe it's just Mad Max.

342
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,960
I don't know if it has a sub name,

343
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,360
but October 20th for Linux and the Mac, the Mac?

344
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,400
What is that?

345
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,040
I don't, I'm not familiar with that.

346
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,480
That might be a version of.

347
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,760
Is that like Windows 8?

348
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,480
It's not suitable for gaming, that's for sure.

349
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,160
No, you don't play, oh, oh, oh, those are those,

350
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,000
all right, that company that used to sell computers.

351
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,080
I thought it was called Next.

352
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,760
I thought they make iPhones now.

353
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
It's the stuff that comes with cheese.

354
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,160
Ba-dum-bum-bum, so that's pretty cool.

355
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,480
So there you go, there's your October 20th,

356
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,400
one week out heads up about the outlandish,

357
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,900
post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max.

358
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,800
You can go get your hands on it.

359
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,560
And you know, have some fun, have some fun.

360
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,600
I was just poking fun at the Mac.

361
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,560
In fact, we're gonna, why don't we talk a little bit

362
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,360
about the Mac here in a moment?

363
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,560
But before we do that, I'm gonna mention

364
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,120
that I'm gonna be at MeetBSD November 11th through the 12th,

365
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,720
so basically 30 days, right, a month from now.

366
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,920
That is great.

367
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,040
Yeah, and if you're in the area, it's down by Berkeley.

368
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,880
If you're down in that area and wanna say hi,

369
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,640
let me know, hit me up on Twitter.

370
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,000
And if you're gonna be at MeetBSD,

371
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,260
you probably should go register.

372
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,400
So you're gonna bring like a Linux laptop?

373
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,640
Oh yeah, I'm bringing Lady Joops full of all Linux gear

374
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,840
to the BSD conference.

375
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,720
Hell yeah, oh yeah, I'm not going ashamed.

376
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,040
I'm going, there's a problem.

377
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,960
What'd you think about like putting true OS

378
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,960
on one of your laptops or something, just to blend in?

379
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,560
No, no, I like my backlighting and my keys to work,

380
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,440
so I don't have any interest in that.

381
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
You're interested in, you know,

382
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,920
like recent CPU graphics support?

383
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,200
Those kinds of things, yeah.

384
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,640
The ability to run an Electron app would be nice.

385
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,920
But I actually am really curious to see

386
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,360
where their heads are at and how the BSD community

387
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,600
does one of these things.

388
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,160
Because I've gone to a lot of Linux events,

389
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,960
I'm kinda curious to see what the differences are

390
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,680
between a Linux community event and a BSD community event.

391
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,240
And I think this is the one to go to.

392
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,920
It is, just from what I've heard a bit coming up,

393
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,680
it sounds like it's gonna be a wonderful event.

394
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,680
And also, the format is one that I think is

395
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,680
particularly appealing to me as somebody who doesn't

396
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,120
have a lot of experience going to these conferences

397
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,960
because this is a mixed, un-conference format,

398
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,200
where there's scheduled talks

399
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,600
and there's also just community driven,

400
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,320
like this is what we care about events.

401
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,280
So from your perspective, it's kind of an outsider.

402
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,120
It's a lot more accessible.

403
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,200
There's a lot more to jump into.

404
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,320
Technical talks and.

405
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,160
Yeah, yeah.

406
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,900
So there you go.

407
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,860
So you can find out more at meetbsd.com

408
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,520
if you're gonna be down in the area.

409
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,640
It's at the Clark Kerr campus.

410
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,460
I'm probably saying that wrong.

411
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,480
It's Clark Care or something,

412
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,760
which is not, I don't think it's on the actual main

413
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,600
UC Berkeley campus.

414
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,440
I should probably get that figured out.

415
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,320
You should get that figured out.

416
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,160
Yeah, you're gonna have to.

417
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,360
That's what, you're gonna have to get there.

418
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,520
I don't know if you realize that.

419
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,680
I'm hoping that that's what NAV is for.

420
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,400
No, I'll drive, I'm gonna drive us

421
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,560
to about 45 minutes away and then listener Ben

422
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,760
is being nice enough to let me borrow his car.

423
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,600
Oh, really?

424
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,040
Oh, well thank you listener Ben, that's awesome.

425
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,980
Ben, he's actually been in the Rover log before.

426
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,820
Oh, right.

427
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,940
Yeah, he might get another appearance

428
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,000
in the Rover log again.

429
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,320
But so that's sort of my plan

430
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,160
and then maybe meet up with folks.

431
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,540
I'm just gonna be down there for a few days,

432
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,160
but if you're in the Berkeley area

433
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,200
and wanna hang out and say hi,

434
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,060
that could be a lot of fun.

435
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,100
So meetbsd.com if you wanna hang out and chat

436
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,200
and let me know what you think about,

437
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,240
you know, whatever's on your mind,

438
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,360
particularly in the Linux world.

439
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,680
Digitalocean.com, that's what's on my mind.

440
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,440
Go there and use our promo code

441
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,800
to get a $10 credit.

442
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,240
Go over to digitalocean.com

443
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,840
and remember, if you use our promo code,

444
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,560
it's one word, all lowercase,

445
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,160
you get yourself a $10 credit, DO Unplugged.

446
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,780
You apply that $10 credit to your account

447
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,600
and then you can drive the $5 rig two months for free

448
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,640
or run one of their hourly machines

449
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,380
and just run that balance until you're done with it.

450
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,260
It's really kinda cool

451
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,320
and there's like no risk there to that.

452
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,380
Right, you don't get overages,

453
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,960
you don't get like, it's just,

454
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,000
they'll turn it off if you stop paying,

455
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,880
but that's just fine.

456
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,360
Yeah, and it's a great way

457
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,120
to try out the DigitalOcean services

458
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,200
to see if it works for you.

459
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,660
And they have data centers in New York,

460
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,240
San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

461
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,240
London, Toronto, Germany, India.

462
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,520
They have a really nice interface

463
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,680
to manage all of this.

464
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,740
It's very simple, but yet very powerful.

465
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,000
They have great, powerful machines

466
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,120
that'll all use SSD storage.

467
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,560
They have an interface that rocks,

468
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,120
but they have an API that matches.

469
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,040
And one of the semi-recent features

470
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,200
that I think is really great

471
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,660
and answered a lot of people's questions

472
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,040
is this block storage.

473
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,880
You can attach block storage up to 16 terabytes,

474
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,920
all of it, resizable, SSD backed, super cool.

475
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,160
Play with that.

476
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,200
And also, I had an MB server

477
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,360
right up there for a long time,

478
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,360
and this would be something,

479
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,800
I don't even have to have something massive,

480
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,640
but just like the kids' movie collection,

481
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,240
so it's available when we're traveling,

482
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,320
would be wonderful.

483
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
You know, I've really been enjoying it.

484
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,000
It seems like they're picking and choosing,

485
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,560
something like AWS or Azure,

486
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,580
or the bigger cloud platforms,

487
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,280
they have a thousand and one features.

488
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,880
Very complicated, lots of documentation.

489
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,200
DigitalOcean seems to be taking the best,

490
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,000
like the floating IPs, like the block storage,

491
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,480
they're kind of taking the best of the bunch.

492
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,400
So you have the features you need,

493
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,720
but in a simple interface,

494
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,700
something you can understand and get going in 10 minutes.

495
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,280
And it, I mean, less, way less than that.

496
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,080
Probably a minute.

497
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,760
I think that might be why I keep creating droplets,

498
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,080
is when I just wanna try out something

499
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,080
I found on GitHub even,

500
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,720
and I don't wanna bother putting that on my machine

501
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,960
for security reasons, for simplicity reasons, or whatever.

502
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,580
You just don't wanna install some more things

503
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,420
that you don't need.

504
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,040
Yeah, and I can just spin it up in seconds

505
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,280
on DigitalOcean, try it out,

506
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,400
and then keep it or destroy it.

507
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,800
And you get that public IP, right?

508
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,640
You don't have to worry about firewalls,

509
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,700
you don't have to just like, boom.

510
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,600
Super cool, and they make managing DNS,

511
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,120
if you wanna go that route, really easy too.

512
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,720
And adding your SSH keys, all of it's great.

513
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,960
All with different Linux droplets you can deploy and enjoy.

514
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,880
DigitalOcean.com, just use our promo code,

515
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,720
DOUNPLUGGED, that's one word, lowercase.

516
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,960
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean

517
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,960
for sponsoring the unplugged program, DOUNPLUGGED.

518
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,720
So we were teasing Mac OS.

519
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,760
And I do actually have something kind of newsworthy

520
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,120
to talk about with Mac OS.

521
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,000
But before we get there.

522
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,840
Before we talk about that.

523
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,680
Just a fun little thing.

524
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,800
Just an interesting diversion

525
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,380
because I've seen this floating around

526
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,600
for a couple of weeks now,

527
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,780
and you've probably heard of it before,

528
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,160
but if you haven't, I think you're gonna enjoy this.

529
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,820
It's Xenix, and it was Microsoft's Unix back in the day.

530
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,560
Microsoft, before they got all DOS happy,

531
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,000
first experimented with creating

532
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,500
a Unix-based operating system.

533
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,720
And they called it Xenix,

534
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,400
and it was part of a messy breakup

535
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,440
between AT&T and IBM, so it didn't really work out.

536
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,200
But back in the late 1970s,

537
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,980
Microsoft entered into an agreement with AT&T Corporation

538
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,720
to license Unix from AT&T.

539
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,000
While the company didn't sell the OS to anybody in public,

540
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,960
it licensed it to other OEMs like Intel, SCO, and Tandy.

541
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,720
It's fun to hear that name.

542
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,640
As Microsoft had to face legal trouble

543
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,120
due to the use of the Unix name,

544
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,200
the company renamed it

545
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,580
and came up with its own Unix distribution.

546
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,120
So AT&T licensed Unix,

547
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,120
was passed around to other OEMs

548
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
as Xenix.

549
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,040
However, in the early 1980s,

550
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,800
IBM was looking for an OS to power its x86 PC.

551
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,920
As IBM didn't want to maintain any titles,

552
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,140
I'm sorry, any ties with the recently split up AT&T,

553
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,560
Xenix was automatically rejected.

554
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,400
Bum bum.

555
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,840
To fulfill the tech giant's demand,

556
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,240
Microsoft, they scrambled and they bought 86 DOS

557
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,480
from a Seattle computer products company

558
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,280
and managed to convince IBM to use it in their systems.

559
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,000
Slowly, Microsoft began to lose interest in Xenix

560
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,600
and then traded the full rights of Xenix to SCO later on,

561
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,620
because they were one of the partners.

562
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,160
And that is how Microsoft started to create a Unix,

563
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,840
was almost made at the base of their desktop operating.

564
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,480
And then they went all wrong.

565
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,380
But because IBM didn't want to have any ties to AT&T.

566
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,240
Boy, those Unix wars sure were messy.

567
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,080
They were dirty.

568
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,920
I mean, we live in such a simpler, more open,

569
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,940
I'm very thankful for it.

570
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,300
I don't think a lot of us have a perspective

571
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,140
of how dirty they were.

572
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,960
No, right?

573
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,440
And I mean, like you still had all the Unix goodness

574
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,680
if you were lucky enough to be able to afford it

575
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,480
and have a big enough system to run it on,

576
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,840
but those were different times.

577
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,340
Back in my day.

578
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,440
All right, so now speaking of a Unix desktop

579
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,640
that doesn't make a very good Unix,

580
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,340
Mac OS 10.12 has a broken poll.

581
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,740
A broken poll.

582
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,360
The poll function, which actually breaks things like curl.

583
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,400
So curl doesn't work on Mac OS anymore.

584
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,480
Which that actually does suck quite a bit.

585
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,320
Wow.

586
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,720
Yeah.

587
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,800
Yeah, that sucks.

588
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,100
And I thought this first comment from ITP on Hacker News

589
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,160
was pretty well put.

590
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,880
He says, I can't say I'm surprised.

591
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,040
I used to be responsible for the port and upkeep

592
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,480
of relatively low-level products on OS 10.

593
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,300
It was far and away the most troublesome platform.

594
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,960
We would frequently run into bugs

595
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,800
that had been reported on open radar for years

596
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,160
without having been addressed.

597
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,140
Offhand, I remember spending the better part of two days

598
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,640
trying to understand a bug that was traced

599
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,880
to a core routine issue.

600
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,360
OS 10 was just not saving a required register

601
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,000
known and reported for five major versions of the OS.

602
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,880
I remember discovering the unnamed semaphores.

603
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,300
I remember discovering the unnamed semaphores

604
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,160
don't work on OS 10.

605
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,020
Also, I'm not surprised the poll would be broken,

606
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,360
nor am I surprised it was broken again

607
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,880
because it's been broken in the past.

608
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
The only thing that surprised me anymore

609
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,120
is how many people continue to insist

610
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,880
that Mac OS, or now just Mac OS, is a great Unix.

611
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
It might be a nice desktop,

612
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,360
but it is definitely not a great Unix.

613
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,240
And I think that is the takeaway point.

614
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,400
It might make a great desktop,

615
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,880
but don't fool yourself into thinking

616
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,240
you're getting a great Unix desktop,

617
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,440
power workstation or something.

618
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,280
It's not that.

619
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
I think at least part of that is when they started

620
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,840
building Mac OS X, and for a long time,

621
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,000
they compete with what the Unix kernel,

622
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,200
or Linux kernel, Linux user land was doing, right?

623
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,840
And you got this nice UI, you got Photoshop,

624
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,000
you got all that on the platform,

625
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,440
as well as you could run Bash and curl

626
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,000
and all that thing in a shell.

627
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,440
But they haven't spent any time or energy or money

628
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,280
on working on that user land on those kind

629
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,600
of kernel features like pull or any of that.

630
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,560
And the BSDs, Linux, we're all moving on

631
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,400
and doing more things.

632
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,200
And so suddenly you're like, well.

633
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,520
But what's weird about it is they're breaking stuff

634
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,800
in their Unix land that they just simply wouldn't touch,

635
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,680
wouldn't be broken.

636
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,120
But they're like, they won't just leave it be.

637
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,480
They're breaking it almost proactively,

638
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,120
which is super frustrating.

639
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,840
Now, this is a segue, but then you combine that

640
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,600
with their shocking lack of hardware updates.

641
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,240
You start to wonder, what is their long-term vision

642
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,160
for the Mac OS platform and for their Intel machines?

643
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,760
And so it's within that context

644
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,680
that our next story comes up.

645
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,360
Linus was talking about ARM.

646
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,360
He was at a fireside chat.

647
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,680
He was talking with David Rusling,

648
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,200
who is the Chief Technology Officer of ARM Tools.

649
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,160
And so this guy.

650
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,920
He knows ARM.

651
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,800
This guy really knows ARM.

652
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,840
And so he's asking Linus questions about ARM.

653
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,240
And Linus is being very honest.

654
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,880
He's like, you know, ARM doesn't really excite me.

655
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,640
Which is interesting, too, just given Linus's history

656
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,680
with, you know, one, Linux, and two, his history

657
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,320
designing processor architectures and stuff.

658
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,560
And he talked about not just because of the instruction

659
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,080
that he says is more than that, it's the whole ecosystem.

660
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,240
So I grabbed just a little bit of the interview

661
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,960
so we could hear it here on the show.

662
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,320
I'll just play a moment of it.

663
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,240
And this is, I'll link to the show notes, too,

664
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,720
if you want to watch the entire thing.

665
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,160
This is no bad thing.

666
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,320
Do you have a favorite architecture?

667
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,080
That's a very obvious question.

668
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,080
I mean, x86 is still the one I favor most.

669
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,160
And the reason for that is the PC.

670
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,520
Not because of the architecture.

671
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,200
It's because of the infrastructure.

672
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,880
It's because it's there and it's open.

673
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,600
And it's open in a way that no other architecture is.

674
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,600
And it turns out the instruction set

675
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,880
and the core of the CPU is not very important.

676
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,880
And it's one of those big differentiating factors

677
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,000
that people kind of fixate on,

678
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,320
but it really doesn't matter very much.

679
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,520
I think that's interesting.

680
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,440
What matters is all the infrastructure

681
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,160
around that instruction set.

682
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,320
And x86 right now has all that infrastructure.

683
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,080
And it has it at a lot of different levels.

684
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,200
ARM obviously has it on the low end.

685
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,400
There's no question that if you're in mobile,

686
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,760
you are pretty much ARM,

687
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,180
and we can start forgetting about MIPS and everybody else.

688
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:16,180
I've been personally, obviously, pretty disappointed in ARM.

689
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,860
Not as an instruction set,

690
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,380
although I've had my issues there too.

691
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,020
But as a hardware platform,

692
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,620
it's still not very pleasant to deal with.

693
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,980
And it goes on.

694
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,100
He says, of course, you guys know that.

695
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,180
You guys are working with ARM all the time.

696
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,880
So now we segue from this, talking about ARM,

697
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,980
to talking about Wes's $9 computer,

698
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,900
the Chip, which he's brought into the studio here.

699
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,520
So Wes bought the Chip,

700
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,020
which you might've heard us talk about before at getchip.com.

701
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,900
It's the world's first $9 computer.

702
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,860
And you got it right here in your hot little hands, Wes.

703
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,320
Tell me about it.

704
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,540
I just showed up in the mail.

705
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,820
It got sent to my old address.

706
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,660
It's itty bitty.

707
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,480
It is itty bitty.

708
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,180
I also got the HDMI adapter.

709
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,500
I've really only plugged it in a tiny amount.

710
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,300
But they do kinda come with, unlike say the Pi,

711
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,060
they have a little plastic bottom already.

712
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,100
So it's kinda, it's a little more rough and ready to go.

713
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,500
So it came with that plastic bottom?

714
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,340
You didn't add that on, huh?

715
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,320
Nope.

716
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,560
Huh, that's nice.

717
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,420
Did you really pay nine bucks though?

718
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,620
Well, no, I paid like $21, I think,

719
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,340
with the HDMI output adapter.

720
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,340
Oh, okay.

721
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,100
Yeah, so it has a gigahertz processor,

722
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,800
Wi-Fi BGN built in, four gigs of high-speed storage.

723
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,220
Is that an SD card that came with it?

724
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,640
Is that when they say high-speed storage,

725
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,300
they mean an SD card on the USB bus?

726
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,420
Is that high-speed storage?

727
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,740
I'm not sure.

728
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,900
Chip comes with storage on board, ah.

729
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,740
There we go.

730
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,920
Yeah, well, there's no need to purchase.

731
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,100
So it actually is high-speed storage.

732
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,940
Yes, exactly.

733
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,100
Bluetooth 4.0, and yeah, you got it with the HDMI port,

734
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,820
and it comes with 512 megabytes of RAM.

735
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,140
Anybody in the mummer room got their hands

736
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,620
on this thing yet?

737
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,460
This chip?

738
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,300
I will say, well, I don't know what I'm gonna quite do

739
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,640
with it, I bought it mostly to support it.

740
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,260
Oh, go on.

741
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,180
Whoa, whoa, I think that was a, hello?

742
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,540
I think that was a Cylon.

743
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,380
It might've been a Cylon.

744
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,220
It might've been a Cylon, we're compromised.

745
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,060
That might've been a chip.

746
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,880
We're compromised.

747
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,220
Yeah.

748
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,060
Yeah.

749
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,620
Have you seen the Pocket chip, though?

750
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,900
Their little case around it?

751
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,660
I was gonna ask you if you were tempted to get that.

752
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,820
Yeah, you know, and I have a friend who has one,

753
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,960
and it's pretty cool.

754
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,540
It's a, he's still kind of learning Linux,

755
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,080
but he, it's like a great little platform

756
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,100
to have on the bus, you know, playing with Linux.

757
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,080
You have a real shell, you can do stuff.

758
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,060
It also seems like something that Noah might be interested

759
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,940
in, just knowing how much he wants to have

760
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,220
a real Linux computer in his back pocket all of the time.

761
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,060
That's true.

762
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,780
And it's not like, you know, it's not like a full laptop

763
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,420
or anything, but you could get a lot done.

764
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,060
I could imagine doing some SSH and then doing real work

765
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,600
or building things or, you know, like bouncing some servers

766
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,440
or whatever you need to do.

767
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,260
Is it a QWERTY keyboard or is it,

768
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,400
oh no, it's not, it's, well, it has a QWERTY layout.

769
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,700
It's like a multifunction keyboard.

770
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,540
Yeah.

771
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,060
So this would be an obvious thing to do

772
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,980
with your chip computer, is the Pocket chip.

773
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,420
So I think that's a really smart move they did,

774
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,660
was they're like, well, we'll just sell a great accessory

775
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,480
for it to give people something to do with it.

776
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,320
And the Pocket chip's 69 bucks.

777
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,440
You know, and I do still like like the Onion Omega stuff

778
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,700
that Alan was talking about.

779
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,580
I think that's maybe a more interesting platform.

780
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,180
But when this was first coming out,

781
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,940
it seems like an interesting kind of middle ground

782
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,900
between, you know, like the Arduino microcontroller layer

783
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,620
and then something more like a Raspberry Pi.

784
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,940
This seems more friendly for some reason.

785
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,940
Like the pitch of it is more a fun toy kind of thing.

786
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,580
That's, you know, kind of neat.

787
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,300
And I mean, maybe that's the Pocket chip

788
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,660
that's kind of giving me that vibe

789
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:34,140
because it makes it seem more like a game, more like a toy.

790
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,700
So if you don't use it, if you don't get the Pocket chip,

791
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,540
what's sort of your use case for something like this?

792
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,900
For a $9, I mean, you got a gigahertz and 512 megs of RAM.

793
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,900
I mean, it's a gigahertz on,

794
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,100
but damn, that's amazing for even 20 bucks.

795
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,760
You know, I really don't have a use case yet.

796
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,060
So if anyone in the audience has something

797
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,700
that you want me to try, I'd be happy to.

798
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,980
I'm going to try to find somewhere

799
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,260
I can put it around the house.

800
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,380
It does have HDMI out, so I will test like,

801
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,640
what does that kind of look like?

802
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,500
What can you play with that?

803
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,220
But it also has the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi built in.

804
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,900
So I could see it, you know, if you have any,

805
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,400
it does have a USB port here.

806
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,460
So like any kind of sensor or anything else

807
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,460
that was integrated over USB

808
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,580
that you wanted to put on your network,

809
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,420
or, you know, like we were talking about

810
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,300
that USB IP kernel support with Linux.

811
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,140
Kind of that'd be great for that.

812
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,960
You could plug that right in here,

813
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,100
just set it right next to it.

814
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,560
If it's, that'd be really an interesting use case for it.

815
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Tiny remote sensors or remote IP USB could be game changer.

816
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,820
But it's, you know, that's the nice thing

817
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,620
where it's like you're not writing C++ code

818
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,540
and compiling it to run on,

819
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,580
or do we know you're like, it's the Linux user land.

820
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,400
That is really cool.

821
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,300
Yourwiseass, you had a comment, go ahead.

822
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:41,620
Yeah, I'm pinging to the outside and doing speed tests

823
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:47,860
so it can tweet if my speed sinks below a certain level.

824
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,940
So you're kind of keeping an eye on your ISP

825
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,780
and kind of getting a little bit of a heads up

826
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,580
when they're not delivering what you're paying for.

827
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,420
That's pretty clever. Exactly.

828
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,260
Yeah, I like that.

829
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,320
Oh, maybe that's why I should do that too.

830
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,480
You know, I'm on a, at Lady Jupiter.

831
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,120
Oh, I wonder, and I would love suggestions

832
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,440
on maybe the best tool to do this, or tools.

833
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,800
But at Lady Jupiter, my internet connection

834
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,840
slowly degrades over a period of few days.

835
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,800
And it seems to be based on my usage

836
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,040
because what solves it every single time

837
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,960
is I reboot the MiFi.

838
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,760
I restart the MiFi, I pull the battery out,

839
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,680
put it back in, let it boot up,

840
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,480
then I plug into the cradle point.

841
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,380
I was gonna say, is this some sort of traffic shaping?

842
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,880
But it doesn't seem like it, no.

843
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,720
I don't know.

844
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,800
I don't know if it is, and maybe when I reestablish

845
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,380
a connection to the network, it clears.

846
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,920
That could be a possibility.

847
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,680
Or it is like the operating system

848
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,180
on this little MiFi device could be completely

849
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,440
falling apart. Right.

850
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,420
And maybe it's like running out of RAM or whatever.

851
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,360
And you know, maybe that WiFis aren't,

852
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,080
or MiFis or whatever, aren't quite designed

853
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,820
for the throughput that you put through them.

854
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,660
Sure.

855
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,800
Or there's memory leaks.

856
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,500
You know, I have a, I'm gonna do a video

857
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,840
on all of this stuff one day.

858
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,920
I'm excited for it.

859
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,240
But I'm still building it all out,

860
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,700
but I have a WeBoost cellular booster

861
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,040
that captures all LTE bands from all carriers,

862
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,600
brings them into Lady Jupiter,

863
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,640
and then amplifies them by 60 dB.

864
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,840
Yeah, it's awesome.

865
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,160
So I can go from one bar to four bars.

866
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,000
How big is that?

867
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,520
Not big, not big.

868
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,360
Wow.

869
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,560
The trickiest thing about it is the antenna

870
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,840
that receives the wireless signals

871
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,520
and the little thing in Lady Jupiter

872
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,760
that's rebroadcasting the signals,

873
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,940
the two can never meet.

874
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,020
And if the booster main antenna

875
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,920
is even picking up the rebroadcaster,

876
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,840
it totally shuts down.

877
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,680
Right, yep.

878
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,320
It does a feedback loop and it totally.

879
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,960
And in an RV, that is a particular challenge

880
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,920
because basically the RV is barely long

881
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,040
as the minimum requirements are

882
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,440
for these things to be a part.

883
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,100
So I have a booster coming into this MiFi.

884
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,040
It's blasting it with a bunch of signal.

885
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,960
And so when everything's going great,

886
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,040
I'll get 23 megabits maybe on a.

887
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,280
That's not bad, especially for parking in the boonies.

888
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,160
Yeah, exactly.

889
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,880
I am on the coast.

890
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,520
I am literally on, I walk, I walk,

891
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,040
I walk 10 minutes and I'm in the ocean.

892
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,520
So I'm like far out in the boonies as it can be.

893
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,520
And to go from one bar to four is 20 megabits.

894
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,680
I was like, oh God, this makes this usable.

895
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,520
This is like.

896
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,340
I have the internet.

897
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,280
Yeah, and then a few days into it,

898
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm down to two megabits.

899
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,360
So of course, stupid Chris,

900
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,800
first thing I'm thinking is well,

901
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,480
maybe my antenna fell down.

902
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,880
So I'm climbing back up on my roof.

903
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,720
Yeah, I'm troubleshooting the connections.

904
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,840
You're all the way at layer one.

905
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,240
Yeah, I'm redoing all the connections

906
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,840
and still two megabits, two megabits.

907
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,720
I'm like, well shit, this is just as bad as it was

908
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,640
before I got the booster.

909
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,200
Like what the hell's going on here?

910
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,380
And then as a part of my troubleshooting,

911
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,760
I left, I did every piece individually

912
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,880
so I could determine what was the cause.

913
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,280
And of course, I made sure to troubleshoot the MiFi

914
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,880
sort of separately.

915
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,560
And sure enough, huge difference after a clean reboot.

916
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,760
And it's better with the booster,

917
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,320
but even without the booster,

918
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,120
I could get six, seven megabits

919
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,560
and it would go down to like two megabits.

920
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,080
And now with the booster, after I reboot,

921
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,240
I get like 22 megabits.

922
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,360
But after about five days, I don't know what's on it.

923
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,160
Yeah, I feel like that's one of the last things.

924
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,280
It's older, I think.

925
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,320
We have these weird proprietary little things

926
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,440
that join us to the LTE networks.

927
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,860
I wonder if like, has Noah experienced any of that

928
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,280
with his like ThinkPads built in?

929
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,100
I don't know.

930
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,260
But see, maybe, see this is running 24 seven

931
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,240
continuously for days.

932
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,920
It's your gateway.

933
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,640
Yeah, and then I have stuff that's all on the land

934
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,560
that I have stuff that determines

935
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,580
what goes out over the internet,

936
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,200
but the actual connection itself is open

937
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,440
and running all the time.

938
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,360
So I've been wondering if there would be

939
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,840
a good open source tool to easily warn me

940
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,720
when it's dropped below a certain threshold.

941
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,080
So like if I could monitor,

942
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,620
but I don't want the act of testing it

943
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,960
to eat up the precious amount of bandwidth I do have

944
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,820
because over the MiFi, it's not just the speed,

945
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,040
but anything that introduces additional latency or traffic

946
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,280
sort of degrades the connection for everybody.

947
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,720
It's not like 20 megabits on a cable connection.

948
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,120
So I would love to be able to test that and map it

949
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,880
and alert myself when it starts to say

950
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,680
get down like the five megabit range or something

951
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,160
without having to also stress the connection all the time.

952
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,000
That's a good question.

953
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,880
You know, because I've kind of wondered about that too.

954
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,460
Like it would be nice to just have that,

955
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,640
something that makes it really easy

956
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,200
to kind of see your graphs of like upstream bandwidth.

957
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,680
So I was thinking a Raspberry Pi of types of sorts

958
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,400
that would, so I don't know.

959
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,600
If anybody has a suggestion,

960
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,360
tweet me at Chris LAS or something like that

961
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,760
that I could run on a Pi or run on,

962
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,040
or I guess I could run it on the laptop.

963
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,560
I mean, cause there is always the worst case scenario

964
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,920
where you run a cron job with a speed test.

965
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,120
Yeah, yeah.

966
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,440
Yeah, just use speed test.

967
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,680
If the results are below this,

968
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,520
but it'd be cooler to have something

969
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,400
that like also graphs the output, a thresholding,

970
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,220
and I mean, you could always send it

971
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,320
into something like Graphite or Grafana.

972
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,340
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

973
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,180
Yeah, that would be, yeah,

974
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,720
something that would give me sort of a historical,

975
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,520
like this is where you're starting to get down.

976
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,920
And then maybe you can kind of observe the trends

977
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,160
and really figure out what's going on.

978
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,560
Those guys over at the Ubuntu podcast

979
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,140
have been getting suggestions from their audience

980
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,880
on things to do with their Pis.

981
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,720
So if you pick up from there.

982
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,720
Yeah, if one comes your way,

983
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,080
that sounds like it would maybe solve my problem.

984
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,280
Mr. Popey or Mr. Wimpy, pass it along to me,

985
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,480
cause I'd be really curious to know

986
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,120
if there's a set of tools out there

987
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,860
or even like a ready-built distro for network monitoring.

988
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,760
That seems like that should be a thing

989
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,640
that would run on a Raspberry Pi image or something.

990
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,640
Well, we've had a bumper crop of feedback

991
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,720
on the Raspberry Pi stuff.

992
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,240
For the next episode, it's been running and running

993
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,720
for weeks since we asked for it.

994
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,960
Yeah, and the projects are getting

995
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,960
more and more interesting.

996
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,880
I will catch the next one

997
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,320
that if there's another batch of it.

998
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,680
Not that I wasn't going to anyway.

999
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,200
Before we go much further, while I'm talking about Mifis,

1000
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,360
why not mention my friends over at the Ting network?

1001
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,440
Oh, you see how we just did that right there?

1002
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,280
Sneak it in there.

1003
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,760
Linux.ting.com, that's where you go to support the show

1004
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,800
and get the discount, linux.ting.com.

1005
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,040
We'll take $25 off your first device,

1006
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,860
or we'll give you $25 in service credit

1007
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,160
if you bring a device.

1008
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,600
What's nuts about Ting is their customer service.

1009
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,080
Have I ever played this video here on this here show, Wes?

1010
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,480
This video from the Ting customer service.

1011
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,380
This is what it's like.

1012
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,220
We look at it a lot, but.

1013
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,060
This is what it's like.

1014
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,440
No, this is the video right here.

1015
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,960
Thanks for calling Ting.

1016
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,020
This is Isabelle speaking.

1017
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,020
How can I help you?

1018
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,860
Hello?

1019
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,320
Thanks for calling Ting.

1020
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,140
This is Isabelle speaking.

1021
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,980
How can I?

1022
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,980
Hey, this is Isabelle at Ting.

1023
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,980
For service in English, press one.

1024
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,980
Para el servicio en espanol, presione dos.

1025
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,980
To talk about phones, press one.

1026
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:35,980
To talk about something else, press two.

1027
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,980
To speak to an operator, press zero.

1028
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,980
Please hold while we direct your call

1029
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,980
to the first available agent.

1030
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,980
Your time is up.

1031
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,980
Please hold while we direct your call to the first available agent.

1032
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,980
Your time is important to us.

1033
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,980
Thank you for your patience.

1034
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,980
I assume they include this in all of their training videos.

1035
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,980
That's what the people want.

1036
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,980
Thanks for calling Ting.

1037
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,980
This is Isabelle speaking.

1038
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,980
How can I help you?

1039
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,980
Oh, wow.

1040
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,980
That was quick.

1041
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,980
That's really good.

1042
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,980
Linux.ting.com, so they have really great customer service.

1043
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,980
They have a super good dashboard to manage all this.

1044
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,980
And I don't know if I mentioned it yet,

1045
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,980
they also have CDMA and GSM services.

1046
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,980
That is the most exciting part right there.

1047
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,980
And then no locked devices, no contracts,

1048
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,980
no determination fee.

1049
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,980
I think this is super nice,

1050
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,980
because if you want to go really high-end phones,

1051
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,980
and it's one that after you use it for a bit,

1052
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,980
you want to be able to hand it down to somebody

1053
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,980
or give it to somebody else,

1054
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,980
this kind of structure makes the continued viability

1055
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,980
of a phone like that last way longer

1056
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,980
than these quote-unquote agreements you get in now

1057
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,980
with the carriers.

1058
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,980
Oh, man.

1059
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,980
And it's way easier to understand.

1060
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,980
Yes.

1061
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,980
And then on the other spectrum,

1062
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,980
it's really easy to do like the budget value phones.

1063
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,980
They just did a blog post for what they call 5 Whys,

1064
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,980
smartphone choices for less than $200.

1065
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,980
And they have the list broken out here on their blog.

1066
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,980
I feel like the Blue Life 1X

1067
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,980
probably doesn't get enough discussion.

1068
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,980
It's got a 5.2-inch 1080p IPS display

1069
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,980
with a 424-pixel density, which is actually...

1070
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,980
That is not bad.

1071
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,980
...pretty high-end, yeah.

1072
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,980
It's got Gorilla Glass 3 scratch resistance, too,

1073
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,980
which is not bad, and a decent camera on it,

1074
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,980
and it's got full GSM 12-band compatibility.

1075
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,980
And it's $158.

1076
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
No contract, no determination fee.

1077
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,980
I almost kind of want that just as like a backup phone

1078
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,980
in case I break my bank, right?

1079
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,980
Yeah, and $6 for the line.

1080
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,980
Yeah, that's great.

1081
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,980
And then just your usage.

1082
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,980
You just pay for your usage.

1083
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,980
Check them out, linux.ting.com,

1084
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,980
and a big thank you to Ting

1085
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,980
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1086
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,980
You've got to go to linux.ting.com to get the discount

1087
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,980
and to support the show.

1088
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,980
And thank you, everybody, for doing that,

1089
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,980
and thanks to Ting for sponsoring us.

1090
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,980
Holy moly.

1091
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,980
You know, I did just purchase myself a Pixel.

1092
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,980
Ah, you did it.

1093
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,980
You know, I think it'll be running on Ting.

1094
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,980
Now, did you...so you did the play, or did you...

1095
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,980
How did you...did you do that, yeah?

1096
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,980
Yep, yep.

1097
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,980
I bought it right from Google.

1098
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,980
Really?

1099
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,980
Yep, and one for the wife.

1100
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,980
Oh, man, I can't...oh, really?

1101
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,980
Yeah, and she's going...

1102
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,980
She's moving from iOS.

1103
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,980
Wow.

1104
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,980
So that'll be an interesting story as it develops.

1105
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,980
I'll be really curious to hear your feedback

1106
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,980
on User Air 7, which will come out probably pretty soon.

1107
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,980
We talking about the Pixel in there?

1108
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,980
Yeah, Swizz putting his marriage on the line there.

1109
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,980
Yeah, right?

1110
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,980
Well, hey, that was her idea.

1111
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,980
Really?

1112
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,980
Yes.

1113
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,980
What pushed her over?

1114
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,980
Well, I mean, her current iPhone has, like,

1115
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,980
damaged screen kind of a little bit.

1116
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,980
It's not bad, but it's, like, she was ready for a new phone.

1117
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,980
What version of iPhone is it?

1118
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,980
But she wasn't...iPhone 6.

1119
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,980
So she...oh, okay.

1120
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,980
I mean, it wasn't a bad phone at all,

1121
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,980
but she just didn't seem interested in the 7,

1122
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,980
and she, like, looked at it, and she was like, okay.

1123
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,980
Yeah, yeah.

1124
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,980
Yeah, I think...

1125
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,980
The first thing she said was, like,

1126
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,980
it looks like an iPhone, so it's probably this...

1127
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,980
Specifically an iPhone 6, actually.

1128
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,980
Exactly.

1129
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,980
With a really tacky two-tone back.

1130
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,980
But other than that...

1131
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,980
Other than that.

1132
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,980
I actually am really curious to hear what you think about the shape,

1133
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,980
because I think I'm really going to dig that wedge shape.

1134
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,980
I know, I think I am, too.

1135
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,980
It's kind of sexy.

1136
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,980
Yeah, and it's going to probably feel good on the table.

1137
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,980
So I'll be leaving vicariously through you.

1138
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,980
Mr. Wimpy, you don't happen to have, oh, I don't know,

1139
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,980
an Ubuntu Touch device still, do you?

1140
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,980
I do, several.

1141
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:03,980
And now I've been negligent in checking in with you over the last few weeks.

1142
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,980
I think we've had, like, a three-week break.

1143
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,980
But how has, so far, your Ubuntu phone experience gone?

1144
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,980
Popi switched his main driver over...

1145
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,980
Or Popi, I'm sorry, Wimpy.

1146
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,980
I'm sure Popi has, too, actually.

1147
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,980
I think that's why.

1148
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,980
Wimpy switched his main driver...

1149
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,980
You don't use it as your main phone?

1150
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,980
No.

1151
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,980
What?

1152
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,980
Okay, well, I want to hear about that, too.

1153
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,980
But let me get back to Wimpy for a second.

1154
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,980
So Wimpy switched his main driver over to Ubuntu Touch.

1155
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,980
And one of the big areas I wanted to hear about from Wimpy was, like,

1156
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,980
how does it work with managing podcasts and doing your audio in the car?

1157
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,980
Because that's a big, big function for me and the phone.

1158
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,980
Agreed.

1159
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,980
So, Wimpy, it's been a few weeks.

1160
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,980
I've been negligent.

1161
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,980
I'm kind of curious why you are...

1162
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,980
I'm kind of curious how it's gone.

1163
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,980
And then I'll get to Popi and find out why he hasn't been using it.

1164
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,980
But how is your experience so far the last few weeks since we've chatted?

1165
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:56,980
So in terms of all of the, you know, doing the social network stuff

1166
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,980
and email and looking up websites and all of that sort of thing,

1167
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,980
that's all just fine.

1168
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,980
Is that mostly native apps or is that web apps?

1169
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,980
A mixture.

1170
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,980
Yeah, okay.

1171
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,980
Yeah, it depends what it is.

1172
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,980
There's, like, a native app for Reddit.

1173
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,980
There's native apps for some things and wrapped web apps.

1174
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,980
But what's happening now is that those wrapped web apps

1175
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,980
are starting to have native elements embedded within them.

1176
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,980
So it's still a web app, but it's got more of the native controls

1177
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,980
integrated with the web experience.

1178
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:32,980
So that's noticeable in things like some of the new Twitter apps

1179
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,980
and the Google Plus apps and things like that.

1180
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,980
So Google Plus, are they doing something specifically to enable that

1181
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,980
in their web app or is this a new feature of the...

1182
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:51,980
Yeah, so the developers of these apps are embedding their own controls

1183
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,980
that exercise parts of Google Plus to make it feel more like

1184
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,980
a native application.

1185
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,980
That's nice to see.

1186
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,980
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

1187
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,980
The new Google Plus app I'm using is very good.

1188
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,980
So it sounds like the ecosystem is really not doing badly at all.

1189
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,980
It's kind of coming together right before your very eyes.

1190
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,980
It is.

1191
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,980
You know, it's slowly, things are improving.

1192
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,980
Although to your earlier question, if your use case is podcasting

1193
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,980
in the car, I can't recommend it.

1194
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,980
How come?

1195
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:31,980
The Bluetooth is not reliable enough and the native podcasting app

1196
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,980
is not reliable enough at the moment.

1197
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:40,980
So I'm still using my Pocket Cast web app to do my podcast listening.

1198
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,980
And you're just wiring it in?

1199
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:48,980
Well, I've had a change in circumstances so I don't need to have it work

1200
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,980
with the car anymore.

1201
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,980
I just need to get this.

1202
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,980
I'm a bit old-fashioned.

1203
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,980
I plug headphones into my phone in order to listen to things.

1204
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,980
Headphones, I'm not familiar with that.

1205
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,980
Is that a new thing?

1206
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,980
Yeah.

1207
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,980
No, it's an old thing that's going out of fashion fast apparently.

1208
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,980
Apparently.

1209
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,980
Haven't you heard about lightning already?

1210
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,980
Come on.

1211
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,980
So how about the really boring stuff like long-term performance?

1212
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,980
Is it staying fairly consistent and battery life?

1213
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,980
So battery life, it comfortably lasts me a day.

1214
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:25,980
Although my podcast wrapper for Pocket Casts has to force keep the screen

1215
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,980
on to ensure that the podcast keeps playing.

1216
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,980
So obviously you're going to take a battery hit if you do lots of that

1217
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,980
without charging in between.

1218
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,980
But if you're not doing that sort of thing,

1219
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,980
I always have Bluetooth enabled.

1220
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:45,980
I have it paired with my two Pebble watches and it's always connected to

1221
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,980
Wi-Fi and 4G and it comfortably lasts the day.

1222
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,980
You know, more than comfortably lasts the day.

1223
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,980
That's wonderful.

1224
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,980
So no regrets overall?

1225
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,980
No regrets.

1226
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,980
I'm pleased I've done it.

1227
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,980
I've certainly seen sort of the rough edges,

1228
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,980
but I went into this knowing that I was going to encounter rough edges

1229
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,980
and that I wanted to help to identify them and solve them.

1230
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,980
So, you know, that's what I'm doing.

1231
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,980
Yeah.

1232
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,980
I have a question.

1233
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,980
Something that seems interesting,

1234
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:20,980
like we've talked a lot about it as like a replacement platform rendering.

1235
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,980
I'm just curious, how much do you use the fact that it's, you know,

1236
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,980
a little bit more like desktop Linux?

1237
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,980
Do you do things on the Ubuntu system that might require root on Android

1238
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:35,980
or might require weird workarounds on Android that are easier on the Ubuntu system?

1239
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:36,980
Not really.

1240
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:41,980
The only thing I do is on the tablet, I do have that connected.

1241
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:47,980
So I've got the wireless screen dongle for one of the screens upstairs and downstairs.

1242
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:52,980
And I do use the tablet to cast the screen to those.

1243
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:58,980
And on the phone, I do that occasionally, mostly for the fun factor.

1244
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,980
But the terminal experience is, you know,

1245
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:07,980
much more Linux than anything and the other devices.

1246
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,980
So I do use that from time to time.

1247
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,980
That's really quite good.

1248
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,980
That's great.

1249
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:19,980
So the enthusiast in me kind of wishes I just had an extra phone to mess around with right now.

1250
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,980
That's kind of where I'm at with this.

1251
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,980
So thank you for letting me pick your brain on that.

1252
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,980
Wendy, don't go far because I want to talk about a few other things here in a second.

1253
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:31,980
But I cannot go any further right now without taking a moment and asking Poby.

1254
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,980
I secretly use Arch Linux.

1255
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:38,980
Poby, out of anybody in the Mumble Room that I thought would be using Ubuntu on their phone as their daily driver,

1256
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:43,980
I just incorrectly assumed it would be you.

1257
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,980
I'm kind of curious maybe why you don't.

1258
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:51,980
And I hope the answer is not for competitive research because that feels like a cop-out.

1259
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,980
Don't say it.

1260
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:58,980
So I have on my desk a Pro5 running Ubuntu.

1261
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,980
It's always right here on my desk and I do daily updates.

1262
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,980
And I use my Pro5 for podcasting.

1263
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,980
So I use the native podcast app, Podbird.

1264
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,980
I don't know if I just don't experience the same bugs as Martin does,

1265
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:20,980
but it seems to work OK for me for like just playing a show and like playing whatever most recent things I want.

1266
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:27,980
I don't use it as my daily driver mainly – well, for two main reasons.

1267
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:34,980
One, I have banking apps and other things that they just aren't available on.

1268
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:35,980
I do have that problem too.

1269
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,980
My bank has an app.

1270
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,980
I can make my own apps for that.

1271
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,980
I have a bank – there's also an app for my kids' bank as well.

1272
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:52,980
So we have this whole pocket money thing where the kids can earn money and it's managed through a phone app.

1273
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:53,980
And that's –

1274
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:54,980
I now want to be one of your kids.

1275
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,980
Yeah.

1276
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,980
How do we get on that list?

1277
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:57,980
You don't – oh, man, I'm cracking the whip.

1278
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:01,980
I'll send you down the mine or the chimney or something.

1279
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:02,980
So you probably don't want to do that.

1280
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:03,980
Oh, OK.

1281
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:04,980
I'll trade you some panels.

1282
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:10,980
And that's – well, the only other one is WhatsApp for a couple of people,

1283
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,980
but not many people I talk to on WhatsApp.

1284
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:20,980
But yeah, it really is just a few key apps that I can't use on a Ubuntu phone really.

1285
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,980
That's the killer.

1286
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:23,980
It is always on.

1287
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,980
It's always sat here.

1288
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,980
I'm always carrying it with me, but it's not the one that's got my SIM in it.

1289
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,980
So if you phone me, it will be my Android phone that rings.

1290
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:31,980
It won't be the –

1291
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:36,980
So rumor has it you'll be traveling in November to a canonical event.

1292
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:41,980
Would that be something where you might maybe bring an Ubuntu touch phone with you for that thing?

1293
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,980
Or do you still bring a different phone?

1294
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,980
I carry multiple phones everywhere I go.

1295
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,980
I used to be there.

1296
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:55,980
Sometimes when we go – there's a UK Ubuntu group where we have –

1297
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,980
we meet up every year and go on a train where they sell – it's an old steam train –

1298
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,980
where they sell beer on the train.

1299
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:03,980
All right. OK.

1300
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,980
We call it the beer train.

1301
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,980
It's called the real ale train, right?

1302
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,980
And we all go on there and drink beer.

1303
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:17,980
But there's a couple of games that we play on Android and on iOS, which you need a wireless network.

1304
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:25,980
And I pull out my trusty BQE 4.5 and turn on hotspot, and everyone connects to my Ubuntu phone.

1305
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:29,980
And we're all playing with the Ubuntu phone being my wireless access point.

1306
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:35,980
So it has some uses that I just wouldn't – I wouldn't have another device with me that was battery powered

1307
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,980
that was a wireless access point that I could just pull out my bag and turn that on and use it.

1308
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,980
So I use it for some weird niche things.

1309
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,980
It's just not necessarily the one that will ring if you phone me.

1310
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:45,980
Interesting.

1311
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:46,980
Yeah.

1312
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:47,980
I've definitely done that for a while too.

1313
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:52,980
I've had phones that are either for testing or when I had – for a long time I had a Blackberry for work.

1314
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,980
Chris, that's insane.

1315
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,980
The other thing is the camera.

1316
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,980
The camera app isn't fantastic.

1317
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,980
It's missing some features.

1318
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:06,980
And I take a fair number of photos of my kids and my cats, of course, and other nonsense.

1319
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,980
And I need a reliable camera app to do that.

1320
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:18,980
I don't want to be that guy in five years' time who doesn't have photos of his kids because he was religiously tied to one phone.

1321
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:19,980
Oh, yeah.

1322
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:20,980
That would be hard.

1323
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:21,980
Yeah, yeah.

1324
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,980
That would be a tough thing to live with.

1325
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:29,980
But, I mean, if you're the reason the Ubuntu phone became the next big thing, maybe it's worth it.

1326
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:30,980
Maybe.

1327
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:31,980
Okay.

1328
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:32,980
This is a good pick.

1329
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,980
I can't see myself running it.

1330
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,980
That's not a price I'm willing to pay.

1331
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,980
So let's talk about – let's just talk about the elephant that's been in the room.

1332
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:43,980
There is –

1333
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:44,980
It's a really pretty elephant.

1334
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:45,980
Yeah.

1335
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:52,980
There is a trend where I think a lot of times in open source something gets forked.

1336
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:57,980
And we almost have a visceral immediate reaction to laugh it off.

1337
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:58,980
Now every now and then there's exceptions.

1338
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,980
I don't know if that necessarily happened when Nextcloud forked, for example.

1339
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:09,980
But most of the time I think if you had heard that the GNOME project has moved on and declared

1340
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,980
that GNOME 2 is old and busted and that in order to have a desktop of the future it must

1341
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:18,980
be left behind and a bunch of neckbeards came along and said, well, this will not stand.

1342
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:23,980
We're going to fork this GNOME 2 GTK2 desktop and we're going to keep it alive.

1343
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,980
I think a lot of people would have looked at that.

1344
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:28,980
I mean, if you remove everything that's happened in the last few years and if you just – you

1345
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:33,980
looked at that concept in its just raw naked form, I think a lot of people would say, that's

1346
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:34,980
ridiculous.

1347
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,980
Once again, open source is splitting its resources.

1348
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:38,980
Nobody's focusing on the right thing.

1349
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,980
People are going off to their different camps.

1350
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,980
And it would be a laughable idea.

1351
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,980
Why would you take this old desktop paradigm that's old and busted that obviously needs

1352
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:50,980
to be replaced, which is, again, a bunch of assumptions being made, and try to fork it?

1353
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,980
That's a waste of everybody's time.

1354
00:49:51,980 --> 00:50:00,980
But yet, here we are, 2016, and I think the Mate desktop is one of the most relevant desktops

1355
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:02,980
in the Linux landscape.

1356
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:05,980
I think it's one of the most widely used Linux desktops.

1357
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:10,980
It's had, thanks to the Raspberry Pi, a huge surge on lower-end hardware.

1358
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:11,980
Massive deployment.

1359
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:16,980
It's made a lot of us – since its launch now, a lot of us go, why do people run XFCE again?

1360
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,980
I mean, it's literally taken that spot.

1361
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:19,980
Very well said.

1362
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:26,980
It's about, I believe, I believe it is currently transitioning into a totally different stage.

1363
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:31,980
And I think you're going to see a lot of it very soon.

1364
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,980
You could probably start beginning to play with a lot of it when Ubuntu 16.10 Mate edition

1365
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:36,980
ships.

1366
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:37,980
I'll let Wimpy talk about that.

1367
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,980
I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I think this will probably be a chance for

1368
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,980
you to get to see a lot of this.

1369
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:47,980
There's some big things that are coming, including what seems to be essentially a from-scratch

1370
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,980
reworking of Ubuntu Mate to go to GTK 3.

1371
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:56,980
I mean, this is taking a desktop that was designed around a traditional desktop paradigm

1372
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:01,980
in technology and moving it to be completely technologically compatible with the latest

1373
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:07,980
Linux desktop, at least for GTK 3, while keeping an existing work paradigm that obviously tens

1374
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,980
of millions of users prefer.

1375
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:11,980
Isn't that a fascinating thing?

1376
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:14,980
You know, clearly there was a – when it was created, there was clearly this community

1377
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,980
of people that said, like, well, wait, this is still working for us.

1378
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,980
So it's very interesting to watch it evolve.

1379
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,980
Because at first it almost felt like a stick-in-the-mud position.

1380
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:25,980
Yeah, you know, like anachronism almost, but functional.

1381
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:29,980
But clearly they're very interested in taking on new technical things.

1382
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:32,980
It's just that there's also things they want to keep and refine.

1383
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:41,980
It is almost – it is almost so obvious in retrospect that I think we've almost missed

1384
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,980
what an interesting transition this is.

1385
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:47,980
And so I think there's a couple of things happening here.

1386
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:53,980
There's work happening upstream with Mate itself that's impacting any distro that can run it.

1387
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,980
And then there's a lot of work specifically going into Ubuntu Mate.

1388
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:01,980
And so before I put too many of the wrong concepts out there, I want to just make sure

1389
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:05,980
that I don't say anything more before I go to Wimpy and say, Wimpy, can you kind of enlighten

1390
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:10,980
us as what's going on with this GTK 3 transition and why does it matter to end users?

1391
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,980
And then could you eventually get to where we can end up seeing it?

1392
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:14,980
OK.

1393
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,980
It's a long way now.

1394
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:21,980
Yeah, so Mate was obviously forked from GNOME 2 using the GTK 2 toolkit,

1395
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,980
and it's been that way for a long, long time.

1396
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:31,980
And behind the scenes, GTK 3 support has been added, and we were getting very close.

1397
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:41,980
And after the 1604 release, I really wanted to shift to GTK 3 because I felt we needed

1398
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,980
to make that jump.

1399
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,980
Otherwise, we'd procrastinate and sit on it for longer.

1400
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:57,980
And so I spoke with the Debian maintainer and the Fedora maintainer back in March, April time.

1401
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:06,980
And we agreed a timeline that suited all three distributions to make the jump to a

1402
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:12,980
Mate GTK 3 implementation so that we could all roll together with that.

1403
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:18,980
Well, in fact, Debian unstable is actually the first to benefit.

1404
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:25,980
So Debian unstable got the full Mate 1.16 built against GTK 3 at the weekend.

1405
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:38,980
It landed in Ubuntu 1610 archives on Monday, and it's in Fedora, what will be Fedora 25.

1406
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,980
So those are three major distributions that are doing that.

1407
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:49,980
And then you've also got the hot and sexy new independent distros like Solus,

1408
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:56,980
who when they go shopping for an alternative desktop environment spot that Mate is now GTK 3

1409
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,980
and it's using modern technologies and it's underpinning.

1410
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:04,980
Why does that matter to me, Wimpy, as Fedora or as Solus?

1411
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,980
Why do I care if it's GTK 3 versus GTK 2?

1412
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:17,980
Well, the main reason that you want GTK 3 is because it's the gateway to even more newer technologies.

1413
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:23,980
Things like high DPI and eventually things like Wayland and Mia.

1414
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:31,980
And isn't that sort of maybe the most important thing to note is high DPI and Wayland are not possible otherwise?

1415
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,980
I mean, how else can you accomplish it with GTK 2? Is there any possibility?

1416
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:43,980
Not really. I mean, you can do font scaling and things, but generally speaking, no, it's not really there in GTK 2.

1417
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:48,980
And there's a whole raft of other reasons, but it's not just GTK 3.

1418
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:55,980
You know, along the way, it's all the other technologies that have since been phased out or are being phased out

1419
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:02,980
that Mate has been adopting in order to keep it current and relevant so that it moves with the latest technologies.

1420
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:10,980
So, you know, Mate looks like GNOME 2 always did, even now with the GTK 3 implementation.

1421
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:18,980
In my opinion, it looks a little bit more polished because we've got some niceties from GTK 3 that weren't there in GTK 2.

1422
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:22,980
But it looks and works exactly like it did with GTK 2.

1423
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:27,980
And that's quite a nifty achievement, I think.

1424
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:38,980
Because what people miss is that the Mate team are preserving our desktop cultural heritage by sticking with this project.

1425
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:46,980
It's not particularly glamorous to continually maintain a project that is effectively complete.

1426
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:52,980
You know, because the objective of the project has been completed.

1427
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:56,980
We're just making sure it continues to work and it continues.

1428
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:57,980
Okay, so that's interesting.

1429
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:10,980
So are you saying, in a sense, by keeping Mate relevant in terms of like the GTK – by moving GTK 3,

1430
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:16,980
supporting things like Wayland and high DPI, but keeping the basic workflow the same,

1431
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:24,980
it sort of is the best way to pay respect and tribute and keep that workflow and that paradigm alive.

1432
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:28,980
Not to enshrine it in like glass and never change it.

1433
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:29,980
It's a living document, right?

1434
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,980
Keep it going, keep it living.

1435
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,980
Yeah, exactly.

1436
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:46,980
And the thing is that that paradigm that GNOME 2 used, it is built on good design principles that still stand today.

1437
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:50,980
There are different ways that you can interact with computing devices.

1438
00:56:50,980 --> 00:57:04,980
And the way that that user interaction works in GNOME 2 and now Mate is well tested, well thought and has years of work behind it.

1439
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:11,980
So it doesn't mean it should be thrown out just because it's an old idea.

1440
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:17,980
After all, we're using operating systems that are based on old ideas that came up within the 60s and 70s.

1441
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,980
Just because it's an old idea doesn't mean it's a bad idea.

1442
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:26,980
The other thing I think of when I think of GNOME 2 and Mate is I think of low resources,

1443
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,980
low memory footprint, low CPU overhead, low GPU requirements.

1444
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:36,980
Is there a way to honor that and make it still appealing to low end devices like Raspberry Pis,

1445
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:40,980
but still keep it modern with GTK 3 and those things?

1446
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,980
That's a little more challenging now.

1447
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:48,980
There's some additional memory overhead with using GTK 3 as opposed to GTK 2.

1448
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:53,980
Certainly it's targeting the Raspberry Pi 3 is still possible.

1449
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,980
That's not an issue.

1450
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:03,980
But in terms of Ubuntu Mate, which has got a lot of additional scaffolding around it because it's got, you know,

1451
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:13,980
full accessibility stack and a whole load of other bits and pieces in the 1704 cycle, I'm going to put some thought into

1452
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:23,980
how we can retain the rich feature set, but rein in some of that excess in memory consumption,

1453
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:27,980
but without compromising the user experience.

1454
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:30,980
So that's going to be a goal for 1704.

1455
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:35,980
Interesting. And 1610 is what? Next week, if everything goes?

1456
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,980
Two days. Two days from now.

1457
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:38,980
Two days?

1458
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:39,980
The 13th. Yeah.

1459
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:44,980
Oh, OK. Wow. I should get it installed and start kicking the tires and see how it goes.

1460
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:51,980
If you go to the CD image, are you familiar with cdimage.ubuntu.com?

1461
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,980
Yeah, you can get the daily live from there.

1462
00:58:53,980 --> 00:59:00,980
If you get the Ubuntu Mate daily live, which is built today, that is our release candidate.

1463
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:08,980
And I'm really hoping that that won't change, that that is the version that will be the final version.

1464
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:12,980
I am downloading it right now. Very cool.

1465
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:19,980
Yeah, I have been looking forward to trying out the 1610 release because I usually jump in earlier.

1466
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,980
But this time I decided since there wasn't like a feature that I was just freaking out about,

1467
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:26,980
I would wait till the release candidate stage. So I'm ready to jump in.

1468
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,980
I will also toss a link in the show notes. So there we go.

1469
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:35,980
Well, interesting, Wimpy. And so I guess kind of zooming out a few levels

1470
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:39,980
and kind of getting back to an overall theme that we've had this episode.

1471
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:44,980
This to me seems like we've recently had a huge burst, even more so in the last few years.

1472
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:48,980
But really just honestly, if you look at the last six to seven, eight months,

1473
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:54,980
it feels like there's been a massive burst in development in Mate, which is benefiting a lot of distros.

1474
00:59:54,980 --> 01:00:02,980
You mentioned Fedora. But also, I think it's obvious that it's going to benefit Ubuntu Mate as well.

1475
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:04,980
And so there's been work that's getting done.

1476
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:09,980
And I think part of it is probably thanks to a form of crowdfunding that you've been doing

1477
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:13,980
over at the Ubuntu Mate project, like you mentioned earlier, a blending of crowdfunding.

1478
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:18,980
And I gather you're devoting some of this funding towards the development.

1479
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:25,980
And I'm kind of curious if you could kind of just recap how that works for the audience and really like,

1480
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:31,980
why not just hire somebody over at, why not take some of these funds you're raising

1481
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:35,980
and just hire somebody to sit there and work on this stuff full time for you?

1482
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:39,980
Well, you can do that. You can hire people.

1483
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:46,980
And that is still a Patreon goal for Ubuntu Mate, if we get to a specific funding level,

1484
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:50,980
we'll have somebody work full time on it. That's an aspiration.

1485
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:56,980
But in getting there, I've actually found that you can get an awful lot of good momentum

1486
01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:03,980
by breaking down small projects and handing off small projects to individuals

1487
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:06,980
and funding these discrete pockets of work.

1488
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:15,980
And during the 1610 development cycle, so that's been running from basically the beginning of May

1489
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:25,980
until the end of October, the Ubuntu Mate crowdfunding has paid out about $6,200

1490
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:32,980
to open source developers to work specifically on Mate desktop and Ubuntu Mate projects.

1491
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:37,980
And that has made a massive difference to the project momentum

1492
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:47,980
because I was originally planning to complete this transition to GTK3 at the end of the 1704 cycle.

1493
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:49,980
End of 1704?

1494
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:52,980
At the end of 1704, which is in June next year.

1495
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,980
So you're a little ahead of schedule.

1496
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,980
We're six months ahead of schedule.

1497
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:02,980
So I planned that for a year we would just do that transition to GTK3

1498
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:06,980
and all the other bits that we needed to port to GTK3.

1499
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:11,980
But all of that work has been done and all of it has been funded

1500
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:15,980
from the investment that the Ubuntu Mate project gets.

1501
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:18,980
And also I key noticed I'm using the word investment.

1502
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:23,980
I read what you wrote about that and I've changed all the language I use on the Ubuntu Mate website

1503
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,980
and what I say to say investment rather than donate,

1504
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:31,980
which is a little hat tip to Ikey and some sensible thinking that he shared.

1505
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,980
That is really smart.

1506
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,980
Because it really is an investment.

1507
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:38,980
It is and it's not technically a donation because it's not tax deductible.

1508
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:43,980
So that's a really good use of the word.

1509
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,980
And it hasn't been an investment, hasn't it?

1510
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:49,980
Because now look, that's a huge leap ahead in the schedule there.

1511
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:55,980
Yeah, so what we're going to focus on now for Ubuntu Mate specifically.

1512
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:04,980
In the 1704 cycle, Ubuntu Mate is just going to be about bug fixes, refinement and polish.

1513
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:10,980
Not going to concentrate on bringing in new features and expanding the scope of the project.

1514
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:18,980
Just make what we've achieved in this 1610 cycle move into GTK3 more reliable, more robust

1515
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:23,980
more stable and true to the origins of the project.

1516
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:26,980
So that's what 1704 is going to be.

1517
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:32,980
So a bit of a yawner by comparison, but I think important work that we have now afforded the time to do.

1518
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:38,980
And I've been setting up with some of the core Mate developers.

1519
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:47,980
We're going to do some bounty source type funding to expand the scope of this project sponsorship.

1520
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:55,980
And I'm hoping that we'll be able to invest even more money in independent developers and open source developers

1521
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,980
that are interested in working on Mate and Ubuntu Mate over the next six months.

1522
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:04,980
See that puts you in a very cool place where at least some of your funding comes from this community Patreon angle

1523
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:08,980
and then you kind of get to help shepherd it and then through bounty source or other things

1524
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:14,980
then kind of give back to the community in a way where the whole thing is self supporting and growing.

1525
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:23,980
And when I post our monthly summaries, I explain who the developers are that have received money

1526
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:30,980
how much they've received, what they worked on and I also put their distro affiliation

1527
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:38,980
and you'll notice in there that there are people from Debian, people from Fedora, people from OpenSUSE

1528
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:50,980
and the most recent open, let's say, open content creator that has been rewarded through that program is Rotten

1529
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:53,980
who's done some work for us just recently.

1530
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:55,980
And also from Drupal Broadcasting.

1531
01:04:55,980 --> 01:05:02,980
Yeah, and I'll give you an insight what Rotten's been working on is retouching some image assets

1532
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:07,980
which are our first baby steps to high DPI support.

1533
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:08,980
That's awesome.

1534
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:09,980
That is, oh man.

1535
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:10,980
Good man, Rotten.

1536
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:11,980
Mr. Tonell.

1537
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:12,980
Mr. Tonell.

1538
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:13,980
I now call him.

1539
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:20,980
So that's, Wimpy, that's a huge amount of progress and I say good on you for taking 1704 release cycle

1540
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:26,980
and tightening it up because let's be honest, the expectation with the Ubuntu Batte distribution

1541
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:32,980
isn't going to be rapid, crazy, revolutionary change every single release.

1542
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:36,980
There's going to be a certain point where people just want something that works really well to be refined

1543
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:40,980
and refined and refined and I look forward to the process and watching that.

1544
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:45,980
So I'm obviously going to have to try out 1610, obviously.

1545
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:49,980
Before we get off of 1610 completely, I know RMH, you had something I wanted to get to

1546
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:52,980
but I think I'll take it in the post-show because we're running long.

1547
01:05:52,980 --> 01:06:00,980
But I did want to put a feeler out there and I'm kind of hoping you guys can help set my expectation

1548
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:08,980
for Unity 8 on 1610 because I know one of the headline features is Unity 8 will be available as an optional session

1549
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:14,980
and I'm kind of curious how I should set my expectations during the review process.

1550
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:22,980
I have a feeling I should set them low but I also don't want to just set them so low that anything's fine.

1551
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:28,980
I don't know where this should be at so I would love to hear both Popey and Wimpy's thoughts

1552
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,980
and anybody else's thoughts on it. Popey, can I start with you and say what do you know about this

1553
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:35,980
and have you tried it and what do you think I should set my expectations towards?

1554
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:43,980
I haven't tried it yet. I'm only running 1604 here so for anyone who wants to try the Unity 8 session

1555
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:46,980
it will be an option in 1610, not the default.

1556
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:49,980
Now do I have to have Intel hardware for it to work?

1557
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:56,980
Intel or the Nouveau video driver on Nvidia. I've not tried AMD because I haven't touched AMD for years.

1558
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:08,980
It also works in KVM, QEMU and VMware Fusion. I don't think it works in VirtualBox but it works in KVM, QEMU.

1559
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:12,980
It doesn't work in VirtualBox or with the Nvidia proprietary drivers yet

1560
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:17,980
but I have seen that people are actively working on that right now.

1561
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,980
So in terms of expectations...

1562
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:24,980
And apps too. What do you think? Include the apps I might try.

1563
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:31,980
So I think the default is just going to be pretty much the same apps that are available on the phone, the default apps.

1564
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:37,980
So the same, the Ubuntu web browser, calendar clock, calculator, terminal, those kind of like the basic apps.

1565
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:39,980
No, not that much.

1566
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:40,980
Oh really?

1567
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:45,980
Yeah, it's the basic session is what you're going to get.

1568
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:49,980
So I'm testing at the moment the 1610 image behind me

1569
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:58,980
and the pre-installed apps that you'll have are the settings, the browser and the terminal.

1570
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:03,980
And one other thing I can't remember without moving across the office and looking.

1571
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:06,980
I'm going to have a launcher, right? I'm going to have a launcher.

1572
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,980
Yeah, and the launcher. So fairly minimal.

1573
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:17,980
But I'm expecting that you'll find that there'll be some documentation coming along fairly soon after the release

1574
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:24,980
that will explain how to install more of the Unity 8 apps and what have you.

1575
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:32,980
I'm wondering, should I, can I expect my Xapps to work? Will Xmere be a thing that's functional?

1576
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:38,980
Yeah, but you'll need to install some things. So there's a technology called Libertine.

1577
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:48,980
You'll need to install Libertine and Libertine Scope or Scope Libertine. I forget which way around the name of the packages.

1578
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:55,980
Once you've installed that through the Libertine manager, which will appear in the app launcher,

1579
01:08:55,980 --> 01:09:00,980
you can create a container and it does that for you.

1580
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:11,980
You just give it a name and once you've created your container, you can then install Debs into that container through a UI.

1581
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:17,980
So if you know that you want HexChat, you just type in when it says, what do you want to install?

1582
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:27,980
You just type HexChat in, hit enter. It installs that into the container and adds an icon to your desktop apps scope.

1583
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:30,980
And you'll be able to launch HexChat and that will open.

1584
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:38,980
And for example, today I've installed Chromium just fine and HexChat and LibreOffice and all of those sorts of things.

1585
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:48,980
So the functions to do that stuff exist and through Libertine, you can also enable third party repositories and PPAs.

1586
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:53,980
So I haven't tested this yet, but I was going to have a go a bit later is, you know,

1587
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:58,980
getting things like Google Chrome and Steam running to see if I can get those going up inside Exmere.

1588
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:02,980
But so far, everything I've tried works just fine.

1589
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:09,980
And that's what I'm using to sort of get my traditional desktop applications.

1590
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:12,980
What exactly is Libertine specifically?

1591
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:16,980
Libertine itself is a container. Is it a Chirrut?

1592
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:25,980
It creates Lexd containers and then launches those applications and binds them to Exmere.

1593
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:27,980
Sounds like a snap.

1594
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:30,980
Almost. Not quite.

1595
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:33,980
So you can create many containers.

1596
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:43,980
So you could create one container for each application or you could create one container and install lots of different applications inside it.

1597
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:47,980
Oh, OK. So it's sort of like a bottle in a sense.

1598
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:48,980
Yeah.

1599
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:51,980
And an interface to help bind it to the system.

1600
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:57,980
Yeah. And then, of course, you've got snaps as well because underneath it's just up into 1610.

1601
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,980
So you can snap install bits and pieces.

1602
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:06,980
So if there are snaps out there that are using Mia, then, you know, they will work.

1603
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:14,980
Interesting. And I think I'm going to kick the tires, but I suspect it probably won't be the main driver for me.

1604
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:22,980
This is the first steps. It's not by any means the full Unity 8 desktop experience.

1605
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:26,980
So that means it's 1610, though, is shipping with Exmere.

1606
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:30,980
So they're both in there and they're both usable if you have an open source driver.

1607
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:31,980
Yep.

1608
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:32,980
Hey, that's cool.

1609
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:38,980
Yeah. So, boy, isn't that interesting? Fedora's got Wayland in 25 and 1610 has got Mir.

1610
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:41,980
And I don't – it's not like the two were like competing with each other.

1611
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:42,980
It's just sort of how it worked out.

1612
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,980
It's just how it worked out, yeah.

1613
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:46,980
Maybe we'll have to compare them side by side.

1614
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:51,980
Oh, Wes, I love that idea. We should totally try it out.

1615
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:55,980
Just see, because we have a couple of Intel rigs around here with the open source driver.

1616
01:11:55,980 --> 01:12:00,980
And I think that Bonobo right there is like in the sweet spot with the Novu driver.

1617
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:03,980
So that might be a way to go.

1618
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:07,980
Well, I'll report back and see how it goes.

1619
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:08,980
Right.

1620
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:13,980
We'll see. That'll be part of the review, but not the review, I suspect.

1621
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:16,980
Now, before we go any further, I do want to play the interview that we had for you.

1622
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:19,980
And I want to mention Linux Academy for making the rest of the show possible.

1623
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:22,980
Go to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1624
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:26,980
Go there to learn about a platform built by Linux enthusiasts, educators, and developers

1625
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:28,980
that came together and said, let's help spread Linux.

1626
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,980
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged is where you go to support this show.

1627
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,980
And now with a new seven-day free trial.

1628
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:35,980
Oh, woo. Oh, boy.

1629
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:38,980
A seven-day free trial, which means no risk.

1630
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:39,980
Get in there, try it out.

1631
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:40,980
Google be addicted.

1632
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:42,980
Go wrap your head around something.

1633
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:44,980
They've got these quick starts, too, if you don't have a lot of time.

1634
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:45,980
You can go deep dive into something.

1635
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:48,980
And of course, if you ever get stuck, instructor mentoring is available.

1636
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:52,980
And I love their video courses, because not only are they self-paced, in-depth courses,

1637
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:56,980
but you can download and take their comprehensive study guides and bring them with you.

1638
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:58,980
And they have everything. It's like, you know, you prefer the long-form articles.

1639
01:12:58,980 --> 01:12:59,980
You prefer videos.

1640
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:00,980
They have everything you might need.

1641
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:04,980
And the community is growing like crazy, stacked full of Jupyter broadcasting members.

1642
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:07,980
And speaking of the community, they now have external profiles.

1643
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:11,980
This is big, because not only is Linux Academy going up in stature,

1644
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:13,980
so just linking to Linux Academy looks good on your resume,

1645
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:17,980
but now you can actually visually demonstrate in a public way what you've accomplished,

1646
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:21,980
which is great if you have a current employer that's helping you with your training.

1647
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,980
Yep. Or you need to prove that you've got the skills for that new promotion.

1648
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:25,980
This is brilliant.

1649
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:28,980
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged is where you go.

1650
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:30,980
And check out their video they have posted over there, too.

1651
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:35,980
Whether you're an experienced sysadmin or new to the world of Linux, Azure and AWS,

1652
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:40,980
OpenStack and DevOps, a sharp skill set is an absolute necessity to succeed.

1653
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:44,980
Meet Linux Academy, an online Linux and cloud training platform

1654
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:48,980
that uses self-paced video courses and hands-on labs

1655
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:52,980
to give you real-world experience for a wide range of skills.

1656
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:56,980
Train for your certification, learn the latest DevOps tools,

1657
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,980
and grow your skill set to do better work.

1658
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:01,980
Linux Academy is not just a video library.

1659
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:06,980
Our scenario-based server labs and quiz system allow you to learn hands-on.

1660
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:09,980
We also have full-time human instructors who answer questions

1661
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:13,980
and help you earn that certification or promotion at work.

1662
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:17,980
We add new training every week so you'll always be up to date on the latest tech.

1663
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:24,980
Sysadmins of every experience level use Linux Academy to stay on the bleeding edge of the Linux ecosystem.

1664
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,980
You should, too.

1665
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:30,980
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged now with a seven-day free trial.

1666
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:34,980
And by the way, if you're going to be at Compute Midwest, go say hi to Linux Academy.

1667
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:36,980
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1668
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:40,980
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program.

1669
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:45,980
And a big un-thank you to my neighbor for mowing the lawn right in the middle of an ad read.

1670
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,980
This is lup time. Everyone knows that.

1671
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:50,980
I mean, even what's crazy, too, is I think...

1672
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:53,980
You need like an outside the studio, like an on-air light.

1673
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:54,980
Yeah, right.

1674
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:56,980
It wouldn't do anything, but it'd be very cool.

1675
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:59,980
Now, answer me this. Are you not sitting inside a soundproof insulated room?

1676
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:03,980
Yes, I absolutely am. Is this the world's loudest lawnmower?

1677
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:06,980
This is an intense amount of soundproofing in here. There is an intense amount.

1678
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:10,980
All right. So that's neither here nor there. We need to move on.

1679
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:14,980
I could do a whole podcast on why lawnmowers are the evil thing ever.

1680
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:18,980
But I want to talk about our friend Andy from InnoCybe.

1681
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:21,980
Wes and I had a chat to chance with Andy.

1682
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:26,980
And InnoCybe is a pure play Open Daylight partner.

1683
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:27,980
They're going all in on Open Daylight.

1684
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:28,980
They seem like one of the leaders.

1685
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:33,980
Yeah. And their story is a fascinating one.

1686
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:35,980
I have a couple of clips from the interview.

1687
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:41,980
I want to start with how by contributing upstream to Open Daylight,

1688
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:46,980
by closing bugs, by fixing little things here, by submitting patches,

1689
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:50,980
they ended up getting leads, and they ended up getting contracts and making money.

1690
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:55,980
And I thought that was sort of a fascinating answer to the question that we often ask,

1691
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:58,980
how do you make money with something that's free? How do you make money with open source?

1692
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:00,980
And so this is a little insight into that.

1693
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:07,980
People typically will find out about InnoCybe because they see our names

1694
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:12,980
on the committers lists of the different projects, and then if they need help with an ODL project,

1695
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:15,980
then they typically call us.

1696
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:19,980
And so I would say that now people have definitely gone beyond the POC stage,

1697
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:22,980
the proof of concept stage, and they're deploying real things in production.

1698
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:25,980
And that's why we help them do that with our platform,

1699
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:30,980
get them to a commercial grade type of production deployment really quickly.

1700
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:32,980
So that's a really interesting thing there.

1701
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:37,980
So you're picking up some customers because they're seeing the commits,

1702
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,980
and they're seeing the names on the commits, and they're saying,

1703
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:43,980
look at this work they're doing here. I want to work with them. I want to pick their brains.

1704
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:46,980
And then that's one of the ways the business relationship gets established?

1705
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:52,980
That's exactly right. I mean, ODL is similar to other large open source projects

1706
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:57,980
in that it's very powerful and flexible, and there's a lot of things you can do with it.

1707
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:00,980
And then one of the negative things of that is it's really powerful and flexible,

1708
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:04,980
and there's a lot you can do with it. So you can get yourself in trouble pretty quickly.

1709
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:09,980
And so we help people stay out of trouble and kind of stay between the guardrails

1710
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:14,980
of what works, what doesn't work, what project is going to be useful for their specific use case.

1711
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:18,980
And we're sort of their lifeline into ODL.

1712
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:24,980
So they're able to sort of make money around this open platform from a contributing standpoint.

1713
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:29,980
And I wondered then, once that transforms into a client,

1714
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:34,980
what is really their main value? And you were kind of getting at this question too when we were there.

1715
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:38,980
You're like, how do you add value since Open Daylight is an open platform,

1716
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:41,980
the documentation is all out there, anyone can use it.

1717
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:44,980
Why do you need to pay contractors, third-party companies?

1718
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:50,980
Yeah, why am I hiring you? And this is probably true for all major open source projects, is the answer.

1719
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:52,980
I thought this was a good one.

1720
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:57,980
Great question. So I'd say one thing that's really common is because it's open source

1721
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:04,980
and it's sort of enticingly easy to get started, you can start down a wrong path.

1722
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:11,980
And not necessarily a wrong path, but it's just that what you're creating might be great for a lab environment.

1723
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:14,980
You need to understand how to really scale it.

1724
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:20,980
Yeah, for scaling and getting into production and making sure it's a very robust solution

1725
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:26,980
that is not going to fail in corner cases, that sort of thing, that requires a different approach.

1726
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:31,980
And so when you're looking at things from a professional quality type of thing,

1727
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:40,980
that's often where we see that if we can get involved sooner, it's better to shorten the path to production quality.

1728
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:46,980
It was nice of Andy to chat with us and get an insight in how a company can make a decent living

1729
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:48,980
by supporting an open source project.

1730
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:50,980
Which then goes right back and supports that platform.

1731
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:53,980
The more people that are making money on it, the healthier future it'll have.

1732
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:58,980
So there's a lot of different ways, and somehow, there's a lot of different ways to crack this particular egg.

1733
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:02,980
And I just realized that they have eggs on there.

1734
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:06,980
And then I just sort of realized why they have – I was trying to – like as I said,

1735
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:08,980
I was like, why do they have a cracked egg on there?

1736
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,980
Ah, because the omelet reference.

1737
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:15,980
Yeah, there's a lot of ways to make an omelet between Patreon, direct funding, Bitcoin,

1738
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:18,980
and commercial contracts and sponsorships.

1739
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:22,980
And somehow, by the time we get to the end of this episode, we had a theme.

1740
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:25,980
We ended up with a freaking theme on the Unplugged show that was totally unplanned,

1741
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:27,980
but yet somehow magically worked out.

1742
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:28,980
Unplugged.

1743
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:32,980
Yeah, that'd be – wow, that's actually – that could be like our slogan was.

1744
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:33,980
Yeah, right?

1745
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:34,980
Let's go with that.

1746
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:38,980
Well, so thank you for listening to this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1747
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:39,980
Thank you to Andy for coming on.

1748
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:42,980
Thank you to Ike for letting us chat in the cone of silence.

1749
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,980
Sorry that didn't make it into the rest of the show for everybody else.

1750
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:49,980
And of course, thank you to Mr. Wimpy for chatting with us and for Mr. Popey for letting me pick his brain today.

1751
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:52,980
I thought that was good to see him again. I hadn't been talking to him.

1752
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:54,980
And to the rest of our wonderful Mumble Room.

1753
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:56,980
Just one of those things.

1754
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:58,980
Love those guys so much in that Mumble Room. All of them.

1755
01:19:58,980 --> 01:19:59,980
Thank you, guys.

1756
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:01,980
All of them. Let's chat more, guys. Let's do it more.

1757
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:03,980
Come back maybe next week.

1758
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:05,980
We could even have a post-show.

1759
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:07,980
Oh, that's a great idea. Let's try that.

1760
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,980
Okay, everybody, thanks for tuning in to this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1761
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:10,980
See you next week.

1762
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:20,980
And don't forget to tune in live at jimmylive.tv.

1763
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:46,980
All right, jimmytitles.com.

1764
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:48,980
jimmytitles.com.

1765
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:50,980
All right, thank you, everybody. Thank you.

1766
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:52,980
That was a lot of fun.

1767
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:54,980
Mumble Room, I love you. You're fantastic.

1768
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:58,980
Now, I wanted to go to RMH, though, because he had something during the show that I wanted to punt to the post-show.

1769
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:02,980
So, I forgot what your point was, sir, but the floor is yours.

1770
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:04,980
Yeah, thanks.

1771
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:10,980
Basically, what I was saying is that there are a lot of people in the service industry like Noah,

1772
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:20,980
and I'm getting started with my own enterprise, and we are all just using this open source software

1773
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:29,980
mainly because it's free for the customer, so no licensing stuff, and we get regular updates and things like that.

1774
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:40,980
And in my business plan, I actually have 10% of my income dedicated to giving back to the community.

1775
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:48,980
Whatever I'm using most or deploying most for that month, I try to give back what I earned.

1776
01:21:48,980 --> 01:22:00,980
And I think it's pretty important that we who use the software that gets created for free for us, for use, that we give back.

1777
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:02,980
Yeah, that's great.

1778
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:04,980
That is. Good on you.

1779
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:08,980
We've been experimenting more and more here with giving back to open source.

1780
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:11,980
It's been a mixed bag for us.

1781
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:17,980
I mean, good, but people usually take the code we use, and then they create something that competes with us,

1782
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:19,980
so that's when I was like, well, okay.

1783
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,980
But at the same time –

1784
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:22,980
That's part and parcel, right?

1785
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:23,980
Yeah, exactly.

1786
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:28,980
So Linux Winter Developments and Vintage GTK3 are all towards the top.

1787
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:30,980
I like Linux Winter Developments.

1788
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:33,980
I think that must be a reference back to Popeye's beer.

1789
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:35,980
How is that going, Popeye?

1790
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:36,980
All gone.

1791
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:37,980
Excellent work.

1792
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:41,980
I'm on my last vanilla cream right now.

1793
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:42,980
So there you go.

1794
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:47,980
Good on you, gentlemen, for both of you for recording double episodes and then still making it.

1795
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:48,980
Thank you very much.

1796
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:49,980
That is a lot.

1797
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:52,980
I don't think we'll be around next week because we're both –

1798
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:53,980
Traveling.

1799
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:55,980
Yeah.

1800
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:56,980
Wow, already?

1801
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:58,980
No, not traveling next week.

1802
01:22:58,980 --> 01:22:59,980
What's next week?

1803
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:00,980
There's the sprint.

1804
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:01,980
Oh, it is.

1805
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:02,980
I thought that was in –

1806
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:03,980
We have a sprint in the Netherlands.

1807
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:04,980
Oh, that is.

1808
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:05,980
Yep, yep, yep.

1809
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:06,980
So –

1810
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:07,980
We will miss you.

1811
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:10,980
Yeah, we will, but I'd kind of love to know how that goes.

1812
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:13,980
And aren't you guys having some press there this time or some bloggers or something?

1813
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:16,980
So there might actually be coverage during the event.

1814
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:17,980
Is that right?

1815
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:22,980
There's going to be some community people invited, and we encourage them to blog about

1816
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:23,980
their experience and talk about stuff.

1817
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:24,980
Good, great.

1818
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:29,980
There's someone from the elementary project with some KDE people and, yeah, various people

1819
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:30,980
going.

1820
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:31,980
Excellent.

1821
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:33,980
Be sure to bring your score on the 40-yard dash.

1822
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:37,980
Is that the first time you guys have done that?

1823
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:38,980
No.

1824
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:40,980
We have one in Heidelberg a couple of months ago.

1825
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:42,980
So that was at the Snap one?

1826
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:43,980
July.

1827
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:44,980
Yeah.

1828
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:45,980
And this is another Snap one, Snappy Sprint.

1829
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:47,980
I mean, but there's going to be a whole load of other people.

1830
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:50,980
But specifically people that are in the press or like in blogs are going to be there, not

1831
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:51,980
just –

1832
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:55,980
No, I don't think we've got journalists, but we're encouraging those people who are

1833
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:56,980
there to share their experience.

1834
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:57,980
To blog.

1835
01:23:57,980 --> 01:23:58,980
Oh, okay.

1836
01:23:58,980 --> 01:23:59,980
Good.

1837
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:00,980
Yeah.

1838
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:01,980
Yeah.

1839
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:04,220
I thought the stuff that came out of the Snap Sprint was like the most information I'd

1840
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:07,100
ever seen out of an event like that.

1841
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:11,500
And it was a super good one for that to happen because it was a bunch of different projects

1842
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:14,180
coming together to work on Snap packages.

1843
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:15,180
So it seemed like –

1844
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:17,820
That's really an inflection point for the community there.

1845
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:21,740
And you know, some companies are very clever.

1846
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:25,420
They intentionally bring like favored bloggers along to blog about it so that way they get

1847
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:26,420
great coverage.

1848
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:28,620
And I kind of thought maybe you guys are going that direction.

1849
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:33,160
But also I kind of like the idea of just saying, no, just the people that attend, please do

1850
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:34,160
blog about it.

1851
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:35,160
Please share what you've done here.

1852
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:36,160
Because –

1853
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:42,300
It does feel like – to some people, they probably don't even know that this isn't

1854
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:46,020
like the second time you've ever done this.

1855
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:48,760
I think some people don't know that you guys get together and do this from time to time

1856
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:49,760
at all.

1857
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:50,760
I mean, it's not the second one you've ever done, right?

1858
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:51,760
Yeah.

1859
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:52,940
No, we do sprints all the time.

1860
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:53,940
Exactly.

1861
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:57,100
There's like – I think there's five in a row in that one venue.

1862
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,100
Right.

1863
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:00,700
There's one right now and then we're joining next week and so on.

1864
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:06,300
Do you see why that is an important thing for the general Linux user base to know that

1865
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:07,300
even happens?

1866
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:12,200
Because it shows an output of canonicals, money, and resources to further development

1867
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,940
of their platform and it brings different people together.

1868
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:19,420
That seems like something that I would be bragging about a lot more –

1869
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:20,420
Right.

1870
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:24,740
I realize it's to further your own goals and to work on stuff.

1871
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:29,660
But at the same time, it seems like a perfect opportunity to brag about some of the progress

1872
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:31,940
and work that's being done and the outreach that happens.

1873
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:34,600
So I don't understand why it doesn't get better coverage.

1874
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,900
So I mean, it can be quite intense.

1875
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:38,820
There's a whole load of sessions over the week.

1876
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:44,860
We schedule like a tightly packed one hour to two hour sessions throughout the week.

1877
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:49,760
It's quite an intense amount of work that gets done and then that gets decompressed

1878
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,660
at the end of the week and some announcements come out of that.

1879
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:54,500
Maybe some press comes out of it.

1880
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:59,140
But we rely on the people coming to blog about it because people have different perspectives

1881
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:01,500
and people join different sessions.

1882
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:07,340
So you know, I might be in one session about Snap upstream related stuff and then Martin

1883
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:10,420
will be in something related to desktop apps.

1884
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:14,180
And so if we both blogged about it, you'd get a different perspective from either of

1885
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:18,060
us, which is why we encourage everyone who goes to blog about it because we get multiple

1886
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:22,060
perspectives with each person coming from their own project as well.

1887
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:26,380
Although I would argue – I mean, that's absolutely the way to do that.

1888
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:31,500
But I would argue that it's not enough because really the only time that gets any reasonable

1889
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:36,180
dissemination is if a larger outlet then picks up that developer's blog and covers it on

1890
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:37,180
their medium.

1891
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:38,180
And –

1892
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:39,180
Right.

1893
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:40,180
But it depends.

1894
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:41,180
It depends how interesting that content is.

1895
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:42,180
If it was like –

1896
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:43,180
Sure.

1897
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:44,180
Yeah.

1898
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:45,180
We sat in a room and –

1899
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:46,180
Right.

1900
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:47,180
And figured out some API or something.

1901
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:48,180
Nobody gives a toss about that.

1902
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:55,020
But unless it's like inside baseball, it's not interesting unless there's some big decision.

1903
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:58,820
Maybe if there was an upstream there who said, okay, we're fully committing to this and

1904
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:00,820
we're going to deliver all of our apps or something like that.

1905
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:01,820
Yeah, for sure.

1906
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:06,940
Although I kind of still disagree because you look at the Open Daylight Summit.

1907
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:12,100
That was pretty much just what you described and we've still got like three plus weeks

1908
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:19,660
of content out of it and they got quite a bit of exposure out of it because for me,

1909
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:22,320
I wouldn't be the one going to the Sprint event.

1910
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:28,020
But if I were going to the Sprint event to cover the development, I would build a story

1911
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:32,300
around the people that are there and the work that's getting done, not the decisions that

1912
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:33,300
were made.

1913
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:35,540
So I think it just depends on the outlet.

1914
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:37,700
I mean I know that's – but you've got work to do.

1915
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:40,500
I guess my point is it's just there's a lot of good damn work getting done and it's

1916
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:41,500
not getting enough attention.

1917
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:42,500
Exactly.

1918
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:43,500
And I just wish we could solve that problem.

1919
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:48,740
And it's also not remaining popular developers that have blogs in the sense of like a big

1920
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:53,340
time developer who also keeps track of stuff they do on a blog and most of the time they

1921
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:56,500
maybe make one blog a year or something like that.

1922
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,820
And so no one's paying attention to it so there's no traction.

1923
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:04,860
So yeah, they might blog about it but if the vast majority of people aren't looking then

1924
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:11,980
it doesn't really matter because if Canonical just did it where they just asked every blogger

1925
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:15,580
to do it and if they did submit like an email and then they just made an aggregate page,

1926
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:18,160
like here's all the blogs about it, check them out, that would be good.

1927
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:21,820
Like planet.abuntu.com for example, that's where you can find it.

1928
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:22,820
Right.

1929
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:23,820
But most people don't even use that.

1930
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:24,820
Yeah.

1931
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:29,300
I mean your best bet is Softpedia picks it up or Chris notices it and things like that.

1932
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:31,380
I mean that's really kind of your best bet.

1933
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:36,140
And the only reason I think I get a little righteous, just like 5% righteous about it

1934
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:40,480
is when I get a whiff of an injustice I start to get a little worked up.

1935
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:47,980
And so the injustice that I see here is – the perfect lens to look at this is just the absolute

1936
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:53,860
talking points bullshit that came out after Snap packages were announced.

1937
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:56,620
People couldn't get – first of all, people that weren't involved with it couldn't get

1938
01:28:56,620 --> 01:28:57,620
the terminology right.

1939
01:28:57,620 --> 01:29:00,800
They attacked Canonical for not working with the community.

1940
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:06,340
Just all of the typical talking points that roll out when a Canonical initiative is announced

1941
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:14,900
and I honestly feel like the work that gets done at some of these events would be a – so

1942
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:18,940
it would be a visceral demonstration that goes against that narrative.

1943
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:19,940
Right.

1944
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:22,300
And it's like even if you don't agree with this like the people are doing real work and

1945
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,500
there's momentum and a community behind it.

1946
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:27,900
I'll speak to my PR people, Chris.

1947
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:28,900
I'm sure.

1948
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:29,900
I'm sure.

1949
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:30,900
I'm sure.

1950
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:34,620
Oh well, the lawnmower guy is here so that means I think we're all done.

1951
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:49,060
We'll go with Linux Winter Developments I guess.
