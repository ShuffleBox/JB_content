00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 18 for December 10th, 2013.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,320
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux doc show that currently

3
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,300
has more raw computing power than the NSA.

4
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,640
My name is Chris.

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
My name is Matt.

6
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:52,760
And I'm surrounded right now by, let me count them down, one, two, three, four, five, six,

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,760
seven screens.

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,760
Wow!

9
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,760
That's a lot of screens.

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,020
Yeah, that's a lot of computers right now, so we're in the middle of this big hardware

11
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,440
roundup where we're reviewing different gadgets from System76, different machines.

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,200
And I just hooked up today the Leopard Extreme.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,640
I actually hooked it up late last night.

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,560
So they sent it to me with 64 gigabytes of RAM.

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
Oh!

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,960
You gotta love that, you know?

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,960
And I'm just going to tell you too, I decided to go for it.

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,360
I installed Arch on the Ultra Pro.

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,360
Nice, good choice.

20
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,040
Yeah, so I got KDE 4 with Arch and I actually went a different direction this time.

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,160
I had problems with Integros, like the, I don't know if it was the repos or what was

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,000
going on, the install wasn't working.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,600
I love Integros, but it just wasn't working out.

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,740
What exactly were you experiencing?

25
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,480
Was it just not installing, like crashing?

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,760
It would get like, no, no, it was fine, it was fine.

27
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,640
It would get through like 70, 80% of the installation process and then it would just seem to start

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,000
timing out and pulling down a package.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,040
I don't know if it was the Arch repo issue at the time or what it was.

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,520
So I jumped over and tried out Bridge Linux, which is sort of along the same vein as Integros

31
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,600
in the sense that they use straight Arch repos and they let you pick like your different

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,880
desktop and they let you choose KDE right out of the box, which is what I wanted.

33
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,920
It's definitely not quite as smooth as Integros, like it's a straight up command line installer,

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,200
but it has like an Ncurses interface.

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,900
Not bad.

36
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,360
It's a little more, it's definitely for more power users, it's not quite as user friendly

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,580
as Integros is, but I got it installed and now I have a completely current Arch installation

38
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,200
and it took about 25 minutes, so it was an interesting experiment because I'd never tried

39
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
it.

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Yeah, it's interesting.

41
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
I'm going to have to check that out myself.

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,800
One of the other things I thought was kind of interesting, to overuse the word already,

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,080
is I also tried Manjaro, but Manjaro suffered from the same exact problem Integros did.

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
Did it really?

45
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,400
That's why I was thinking it might have been a repo issue.

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
It must be.

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Yeah.

48
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
I mean, it's really hard to say exactly what was going on.

49
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,280
The only thing I've ever experienced as far as a Manjaro versus Integros situation was

50
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,280
that one Ethernet, that one Broadcom Ethernet driver issue to where Integros was not having

51
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,160
it and it couldn't install because, get this, it couldn't get to the Internet.

52
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,480
Of course, there was no detection on the wireless front and of course, you're not getting any

53
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,320
love on the Ethernet front.

54
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,360
It kind of means you can either go the long way through Canvas, personally it would just

55
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,000
be easier to install Arch at that point, but I just went with Manjaro on it and it worked

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
out okay.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,120
Well, so I want to apologize up front.

58
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,080
I'm not really so sick anymore, like I feel fine, but I still have some junk in my throat

59
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,000
and it's fine unless I talk, which is not reallyâ€¦

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That could be a problem.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,520
Actually, when I think about it, it's kind of a problem.

62
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,600
So you might hear, I'll try to mute my mic from time to time, but I do have a little

63
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
junk in there.

64
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,080
That'll give you an opportunity to yammer on.

65
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
Yeah, that's true.

66
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,840
And you know, I have, it's not the best solution, people, but it's all I have to

67
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,680
work with is a little 100 proof peppermint schnapps.

68
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,680
You can see it's already working.

69
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,840
It's got the tongue feeling good.

70
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,880
So I'll be sipping on that as the cough comes up.

71
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,680
But I wanted to touch on something before we go on, Matt, because I have a little more

72
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,020
things to say on the System76 stuff, but of course, as is to be expected on the internet,

73
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:02,680
there was a critique and of course, Stowolf2 in our subreddit who saw it fit to post the

74
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,720
same thing twice in the thread, said that the whole show was more or less a big commercial

75
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,720
this time.

76
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,360
This is, he's talking about our System76 laptop special from season 29 episode 10 of

77
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,000
last that came out on Sunday.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,960
I really hope it won't take that long before they're finished this because I have no interest

79
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,560
whatsoever with this kind of thing.

80
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,480
I really hope they got paid quite a bit.

81
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,600
I'm willing to go through a couple of them if it means shows will continue, but I cringe

82
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,160
myself the whole time wanking off a sponsor the whole episode this week.

83
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,440
So I think there's a bit of an assumption here that this was a paid.

84
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
Yeah.

85
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,480
And that's, well, first of all, there was no wanking that was happening to my knowledge,

86
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,960
at least I didn't get anything there.

87
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,440
But no, I would definitely say that this is based on the fact that we're celebrating and

88
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,040
reviewing hardware that is built to run Linux.

89
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,440
Yes, they are a sponsor.

90
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,760
Yes, I've also been using myself as have you been using these guys long before the Linux

91
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,600
eyes ever on the Linux action show.

92
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,240
So I've been promoting them way before I had anything to do with them.

93
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,760
So these are products and services, these are products we're actually excited about.

94
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,360
So at least from my perspective, and that's what we're doing.

95
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,320
That's exactly it.

96
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,880
There's no exchange of money.

97
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,040
When I asked to be sent these computers, we didn't tell them how to spec them or anything

98
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
like that.

99
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
We don't get to keep them.

100
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
I mean, God, that'd be awesome.

101
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,600
And I also would argue, I don't think we got necessarily preferential treatment either.

102
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,360
I think we, you know, there's just as they became available, they were sent to us.

103
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
Right.

104
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
Yeah.

105
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
Yeah.

106
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
And there was a waiting list.

107
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Yeah.

108
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
And it really and you'll notice.

109
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,600
So the way the system 76 sponsorship works is system 76 sponsors a particular segment

110
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,440
and not the entire show and we move that segment sponsorship out of the system, the review

111
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
like we'll do next week when we're talking about the leopard extreme.

112
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
Absolutely.

113
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,320
And another thing that happened on Google Plus and I'm finally glad is taking place

114
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,000
is the old, well, they're rebranded such and such and whatnot.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,440
And I'm really excited to see that Carl came out of the woodwork and actually address this

116
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,080
and I'll actually provide it maybe in the show notes as to what he responded to.

117
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,320
But he was actually talking about, you know, what makes them different, how, you know,

118
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,960
what system 76 does to actually ensure that they're compatible.

119
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
The custom bios, hand to hand.

120
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
Right.

121
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
The hardware keys for the function keys.

122
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Yeah.

123
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Exactly.

124
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Right.

125
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,080
And in case of my bonobo, the modification so that the GPU would work properly under

126
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,600
Linux and not just under Ubuntu but all Linux, right?

127
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,680
Which was later on, I mean at the time I bought it to run Ubuntu but then later on I decided

128
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,740
to run Arch.

129
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,920
So there's all this stuff that they don't spend, because, you know, this is of no value

130
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,380
to you guys to sit there and for them to ramble on about all this stuff.

131
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,540
But this is all the stuff that's actually happening behind the scenes that make these

132
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,400
guys unique.

133
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,560
And I think it's pretty exciting.

134
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,120
So are they Clivo based?

135
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
Yes.

136
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
That's the base, right.

137
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
Yeah, they're based.

138
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,940
But there's a lot of extra stuff there you're not seeing.

139
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,360
But unfortunately it's easier a lot of times to, from an easy chair to point and go, it's

140
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
just rebranded.

141
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,440
So there's changes at the hardware level, but then there's also there's the support

142
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,100
angle of it, which for some folks matters a lot more than other folks.

143
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,680
What I come back to at the end of the day is the strongest statement we can make as

144
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,520
Linux users, and this is one of the reasons why even though I don't play all of them,

145
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,420
I often pick up a Steam game, is there is nothing more powerful than Linux users voting

146
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,420
with their wallet.

147
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,120
And in the Linux ecosystem, especially in the free software world, there's not always

148
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,600
a lot of opportunities to clearly make your voice be heard.

149
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,480
And the thing is, is one of the reasons why I've been buying, and they don't sponsor this

150
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
show, right?

151
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
Right.

152
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,480
Exactly.

153
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
They don't sponsor Unplugged.

154
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
I can say whatever I want.

155
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,840
But the truth is, the reason why I've been buying them for seven, eight years is because

156
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:32,040
that money goes into a company that then continues to push the desktop Linux agenda forward,

157
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
right?

158
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Right.

159
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,640
And so the thing is, is I know, for example, a lot of people love Lenovo ThinkPads, and

160
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,600
they probably are, I don't actually, I haven't had one for a while, but they often are very

161
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
good hardware.

162
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,960
But the problem at the end of the day is that purchase is actually voting for the Windows

163
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:54,280
desktop, because they're not counting it as like an Ubuntu desktop machine.

164
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
They're not counting it like that.

165
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,720
Because on top of that, there's the aspect of the interaction with the community, with

166
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,200
the drivers, the Ubuntu forums, and all of that that I really respect.

167
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,640
I respect a company that actually follows the community and doesn't just get Linux,

168
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,860
but actually actively participates in it.

169
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,560
And it's not that I, no disparity for anybody that wants to buy a Lenovo.

170
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,480
You buy whatever hardware works best for you.

171
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,640
Everybody, I mean, I've got Macs in the studio, okay?

172
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,080
So I understand there's hardware out there that does what you need to do and you need

173
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,080
to buy it.

174
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,720
My point is, is that is a vote.

175
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,280
And that's like when I do decide to buy a Mac, that internally for me is a very long

176
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,800
process of reflection that I go through and I spend way more time than I should like specking

177
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,120
out a Hackintosh, trying to figure out how to not vote with my wallet, because that is

178
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,120
the most powerful vote.

179
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,960
And that's another reason why I like System76 quite a bit.

180
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,520
And all of that plays a factor into when I look at a System76 unit and I think, you know,

181
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,060
this is something for Linux and how good is it in that context?

182
00:08:52,060 --> 00:09:01,000
And that's why for me, Ultra Pro, not only did it change my perspective on Ultrabooks,

183
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,440
because obviously somebody has the Bonobo, I'm kind of as much power as I can cram in

184
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
there.

185
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,600
But it also changed my perspective on Intel graphics, which I think in the long run is

186
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,680
going to be the biggest thing I carry forward from this review is just how far the Iris

187
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,200
graphics have come.

188
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,840
And again, the Linux games aren't the most demanding games on the market.

189
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,700
I really haven't seen anything that the 680 and my Bonobo can't just chew through without

190
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,920
ultimate settings.

191
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,400
So it's maybe not a fair test.

192
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,560
Maybe it wouldn't perform as well under Windows.

193
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
I don't know.

194
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
I didn't try.

195
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:37,360
But I loaded Half-Life 2 on this Ultra Pro under Arch using Steam and it was butter smooth.

196
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,800
I didn't even adjust any of the video settings.

197
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,840
I just wanted to get in game and see like could I get enough frame rates to actually

198
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,440
expect to be able to shoot somebody.

199
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,800
And it was like it was as if I was playing on an embedded video.

200
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,880
And I understand that Half-Life 2 is not, you know, it didn't just come out.

201
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,240
It's not the most current game.

202
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,160
But at the same time, the way I look at it is if you're looking at getting an Ultra

203
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,460
Book, gaming for you is probably not the first priority.

204
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,920
It's probably more like something you do on a social occasion.

205
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
And I thinkâ€¦

206
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
It's secondary, yeah.

207
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Right.

208
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,840
It's something you might like to be able to do, but it's not going to decide the purchase.

209
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,020
And I feel like the embedded graphics are now at that level and that's extremely exciting

210
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,760
for me because Intel graphics are a cheap, they're low power.

211
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,840
If you consider the Intel chip too.

212
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,800
And also open source, the drivers, right?

213
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,760
So you have open source drivers, which is great.

214
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,600
And not only do we have open source drivers, but Intel has shown us that they will work

215
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,160
with the Linux kernel team one generation out.

216
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,480
So while one generation is on the market, before Haswell even hit the stores, they already

217
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,380
had drivers into the Linux kernel.

218
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,560
And to me, that's huge.

219
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,540
So I'm really excited to see where that goes.

220
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,940
And so they haven't paid for any special treatment.

221
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,800
We asked to be sent the hardware.

222
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,600
We wanted to check it out because in both Matt and I's opinion, this is the premier

223
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,160
Linux hardware vendor.

224
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,320
Well, in my own personal desktop computers and old, I mean, hell, I've got my laptop

225
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,320
behind me from 2008.

226
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
It's a system 76.

227
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
It still works.

228
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,560
I've got a pile of laptops in front of me from other companies that don't work any

229
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
longer.

230
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,520
So I think the quality is certainly reasonable in that regard.

231
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:14,120
And I've had good experiences with them coming from an old PC repair background and watching

232
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,840
people buy crap and then get all butthurt over it when their stuff doesn't work anymore.

233
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,760
I really value quality.

234
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,680
I don't want to, and that's not just the product, but also the service and the way I'm treated.

235
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,320
And that's a big part of it for me as well.

236
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Yeah.

237
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:36,120
So on my Google Plus page, I posted some hardware porn of the intern of the leopard extreme.

238
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,520
And this is a really well-built computer.

239
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,680
And I'm looking at it as a Mac Pro competitor.

240
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:50,040
So the unit they sent me, 64 gigs of RAM and a six core Intel i7 processor.

241
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,120
What I want to try to figure out is a lot of, once I'm done editing a show, I hand it

242
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,180
off to FFmpeg on different computers throughout my house.

243
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:04,120
And through benchmarks, I've determined which computers are best at encoding which versions.

244
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,200
Some are better at shrinking video down and then putting out an iPod friendly format.

245
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,480
And some are better doing just straight encoding to 720p with no scaling.

246
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
And it's all-

247
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
Oh, that's interesting.

248
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
Yeah.

249
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,840
So you're saying that different machines actually specialize more so in different encoding techniques

250
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
than other machines.

251
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Right.

252
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
Yeah.

253
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,040
And so I'm wondering where this thing falls down.

254
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,640
So what would be incredible, and I don't actually know if it can be accomplished, is if this

255
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,520
machine could make web and video encoding economical.

256
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:41,440
Because right now, what happens on the Jupiter Broadcasting website is I post a show and

257
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,920
I usually use the YouTube embed for sometimes a couple of days because the web and video

258
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,600
takes so long to encode that I often just don't get back to it till a couple of days

259
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
down the road.

260
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,200
So I can't use HTML5 video.

261
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,760
And so I'm hoping that this might be the machine that makes webM doable.

262
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
We'll see.

263
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
I don't know yet.

264
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,640
I got a lot of things I'm going to be throwing at it, but it's pretty cool.

265
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,360
I got it under my desk right now sitting right next to me.

266
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,800
And I got a nice Logitech G19 keyboard hooked up to it.

267
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,400
So I'm like, I'm full in.

268
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Yeah.

269
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
I'm enjoying it.

270
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
All right, Matt.

271
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,960
Well, we got a couple of emails we should get into.

272
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,720
The first one is getting girls on Linux.

273
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,720
This was a response to some comments we made on a recent show.

274
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,880
Did you want to read this one?

275
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Yeah.

276
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Let's get over to that.

277
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
Girls on Linux.

278
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Getting girls on Linux.

279
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
Okay.

280
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,360
Getting girls, which I think was a pickup from a topic we touched on last week.

281
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
Yeah.

282
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Okay.

283
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,080
So I'm going to try not to butcher this here as we go.

284
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,880
As a female who discovered Linux in college, I wanted to add my own response to the questions

285
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,080
on how to get girls to use Linux.

286
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
Okay.

287
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
Interesting enough.

288
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,680
The most important reason for someone to switch â€“ I'm reading word for word, so it's

289
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,040
going to be a little bit short.

290
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:52,480
The most important reason for someone to switch OS is not who will be doing their tech support.

291
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,320
So okay, I think basically what they're saying with that was regarding the tech support.

292
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Okay.

293
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Moving on to the next piece.

294
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,600
It is how â€“ let me make that bigger so I can see it.

295
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,880
Hang on just a minute.

296
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
Probably reread that.

297
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
All right.

298
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Let's try it again.

299
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Let's see.

300
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,160
It is how they switch that will make their life easier.

301
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,360
Any female studying STEM in college â€“ I studied physics and used tons of open source

302
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,640
software in my research â€“ using Linux is a great way to separate yourself when applying

303
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
for research positions.

304
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,440
That's actually a really good point.

305
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,440
Okay.

306
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,440
It also offers some awesome creative outlets for other majors as well.

307
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,200
Liberal arts students should love the freedom and ideals that Linux offer to the user.

308
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,520
Most importantly, it can save them a ton of money, which is also true.

309
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Great point.

310
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,520
Yeah.

311
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
Excellent point.

312
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
Okay.

313
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
I know it wasn't your intention to demean women.

314
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,600
However, let's stop focusing on women as outliers who need a different type of convincing

315
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,680
than men on why to use Linux.

316
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,000
The benefits of Linux apply to all genders equally.

317
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,200
I think that really summarizes in that last sentence.

318
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Yeah.

319
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,240
I think this is something, too, that really resonated with me.

320
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,020
I kind of feel like it's insincere when a bunch of guys talk about how to get women

321
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,020
into technology.

322
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
That kind of seems like â€“

323
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,520
I can't speak for you, Chris, but I know talking with my wife, there is absolutely

324
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,520
a thing there.

325
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:13,920
Not because she's a woman, but because she looks at task management and various things

326
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,040
differently than I do because hold on to your hats, kids, because of gender.

327
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,960
I think it's interesting because at one end, what's going to draw women into technology?

328
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,200
It's going to be the same thing that draws men into technology, but when you look at

329
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,880
the actual end-use cases like in the home, my wife and I use technology very differently.

330
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,680
I would even say my wife's more effective with technology than I am in a lot of ways

331
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,520
because she does tend to work smarter.

332
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,640
I'm the guy that does multiple trips to bring groceries into the house when she will

333
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,040
find a way to do it in one or two trips.

334
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,840
There's definitely an effectiveness there, but I think at the end of the day, I see what

335
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,420
they're saying, but I definitely think that there are differences and they can be embraced

336
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,920
in a healthy, non-negative way.

337
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,080
One thing I wanted to clear up is I think there was a misunderstanding.

338
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,280
She said one of the things, what's going to make women switch is who's going to be their

339
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
tech support.

340
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,800
I didn't mean it as in women will switch to whatever the men will help them with.

341
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,860
What I mean is usually when you're switching to something new, you're going to have the

342
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,040
most success when other people in your immediate social group also use that same technology

343
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,920
so that way they can share experiences or provide insights when you get stuck somewhere.

344
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,840
I don't think it necessarily depends on, although in a sense, I guess that does mean who's going

345
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
to be the tech support.

346
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,480
But at the end of the day, honestly, if we want to really quit trying to be politically

347
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,260
correct and be honest with ourselves, there are some things, like I'm very good at certain

348
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,120
things that my wife's not good at.

349
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,580
My wife's very good at things that I'm not good at and they're not necessarily gender

350
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,200
specific, but some of them are.

351
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,640
Some of those things, like for instance, when it comes to actually planning out the layout

352
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,120
of our home, that was my wife.

353
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,160
You guys are like peanut butter and jelly.

354
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
I know, right?

355
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,000
I mean, at the end of the day, it's like I don't want to be too sensitive about this

356
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,240
because it just doesn't really add any value to it.

357
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,880
Yeah, I don't know.

358
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,880
It's a tough call.

359
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,920
I definitely hear what she's saying and she's got some great points.

360
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,920
I definitely like the benefits of all genders equally, but I think there are inherent differences

361
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,920
that we can embrace and do so in a positive way.

362
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,520
So moving on as a follow-up thread to the topic of swap partitions, we had a lot of

363
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,520
interesting facts.

364
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,000
I've got a couple I'll get to here.

365
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,920
Panda Brain wrote and he said in the debate last week, no one mentioned swap files.

366
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,080
Those are files that can be used for the same things as a swap partition is used for, i.e.

367
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,560
offloading content from memory and hibernation.

368
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,680
Unlike swap partitions, they can be created, removed, or resized on the fly.

369
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,160
There is no real disadvantage unless you use ButterFS, which just simply doesn't support

370
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
them.

371
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,680
You'll find more information about swap files in the always excellent Arch Wiki, and he

372
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,160
has a link to that.

373
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,160
So the swap partition thing, it's so funny.

374
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Gosh.

375
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,520
Yeah, you really opened up a can of worms with that one.

376
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,520
If this was a Windows podcast, it would be our should I defragment my drive topic.

377
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,640
This is something Linux users pine over all the time, and you know what?

378
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,680
I think SSDs have made it even more... Now everybody's like, well, now I don't have very

379
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,680
much space.

380
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,720
I've only got 128 gigabytes of space.

381
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,560
Should I really give several gigabytes to my swap file?

382
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,080
What am I even using that for?

383
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,400
I've got eight gigs of RAM.

384
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,600
That's what everybody's thinking.

385
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,560
There are ways to take advantage of hibernation without the swap file.

386
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,880
But it probably requires a little bit of research.

387
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,820
You actually got to kind of plan out what your goals are and decide which approach is

388
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,820
best for you.

389
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,820
So yeah, there's a little bit of homework involved.

390
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Yeah, yeah.

391
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,260
We're going to get to the topic of the swap file again, but I wanted to read some feedback

392
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,840
we got from Ray, which I had actually been meaning to personally write Ray back, but

393
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,280
I just haven't done it yet, so this will be the first time I've addressed him.

394
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,320
Ray wrote into the show and he said, hey Chris, I'm one of the golden ticket winners from

395
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
Ting.

396
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,720
I just wanted to say how happy I am I have switched to their service.

397
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,640
So I wanted to say thank you, Ray, for doing this.

398
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,360
This is an excellent point.

399
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:00,400
So Ting is sponsoring this episode of Linux Unplugged and I have to tell you, I am a big

400
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
fan of Ting.

401
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,560
I've been telling you about Ting for a while now and I think they're a great company.

402
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,600
It's not just that I like their service and it's not just that I like their pricey model

403
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,520
and it's not just that they have no contracts and no early termination fees and that I own

404
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,080
the phone and that hotspot and tethering are included.

405
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,520
And honestly, all of those things are what got me to switch to Ting, but they're not

406
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,920
what keeps me at Ting.

407
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,560
What keeps me at Ting is the fact that I'm, again, voting with my wallet and I'm giving

408
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,320
my money to a company that I'm really passionate about.

409
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,280
So Ray Roni says, I signed up through the last URL and I purchased a Nexus S with a

410
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
$25 discount.

411
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Nice.

412
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,640
Yeah, you can get that same discount by going to linux.ting.com.

413
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,200
He says, the phone arrived sooner than I expected and I couldn't be happier after working out

414
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,120
a few bugs with tech support and later a new battery that cleared up some problems.

415
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:53,180
It's been a little tight on cash flow for a long time and I have an $85 phone that has

416
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:58,560
4G and it's near showroom-like condition plus a $400 credit that I will cover my cost for

417
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,240
my Ting plan for the next year.

418
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,520
He was on an Android 2.2.2 device before that his dog had slobbered up a little bit.

419
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,520
Whoa.

420
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
Yeah.

421
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
He said, I'd have been...

422
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,800
By the way, he got to use Nexus S, which is a really great way to save money when you're

423
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
switching to Ting.

424
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,640
He said, I would have been without a personal phone by the end of October if not taking

425
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,200
advantage of the deal and the affordable service.

426
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,360
I'm blessed with grateful and willing budgeting for my next device on Ting sometime next year,

427
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,680
maybe the Nexus 5.

428
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,680
So get started by going over to linux.ting.com.

429
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,860
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

430
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,000
They're my mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider.

431
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,960
Personally I've got the HTC One and the Nexus 5 on Ting service and it's awesome because

432
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,320
they have a great dashboard that lets me see exactly where each phone is at.

433
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,740
I can put one phone on suspend if I'm not going to use it for a little while.

434
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,640
There's tons of really nice things in the Ting dashboard, but really the great thing

435
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,680
about Ting is you only pay for what you use.

436
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,620
They take your messages, your minutes, and your megabytes and they add them all up at

437
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,180
the end of the month, whatever bucket you fall into.

438
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,440
That's just what they charge you for.

439
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,480
You want to turn on tethering for a little while, do it because son, it's only $6 a month

440
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,680
flat and then you only pay for what you use on top of that.

441
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,920
Average Ting bill is between $21 and $33 a month.

442
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Think about that.

443
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,280
What are you paying right now on your smartphone?

444
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,920
Go over to linux.ting.com and click that how much would you save button right in the middle

445
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,080
of the page.

446
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,860
Put your current stuff in there.

447
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,860
Just put your bill in there.

448
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,860
I'm not judgy.

449
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,800
Just put your bill in there and see how much you're paying right now and compare that to

450
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,720
Ting because I've got Hotspot and tether, I've got an up to date Android phone that

451
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,980
is awesome that I own, that I only pay for what I use and I have no contract and there's

452
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,280
no early termination fee.

453
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,260
I'm truly in control and as these mobile devices become more popular, as this computing platform

454
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,080
becomes the norm, these are the little details that will matter the most.

455
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,360
You can get started by going to linux.ting.com and don't worry, if you're in a contract

456
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:46,320
right now, Ting has an early termination relief program and they'll take up to $75 per line

457
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
that you have to cancel.

458
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
It's super easy.

459
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,420
All you have to do is go over to Ting, get your phone, port your number and then submit

460
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,420
your ETF claim.

461
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,960
That's early termination fee.

462
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,000
Submit your ETF claim to Ting and they'll take care of you.

463
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,640
So, go get started by going to linux.ting.com and a huge thanks to Ting for sponsoring

464
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,400
Linux Unplugged and congratulations to Ray for becoming a golden ticket winner.

465
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,880
Isn't that awesome?

466
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
You know, it's so cool.

467
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,760
It is so cool and also, I don't want to steal thunder, but we have a little announcement

468
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,680
to make on the Fo' Show.

469
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,280
Somebody just got a whole bunch of service too.

470
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,840
Alright, so let's get back on this topic.

471
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
I got a big one.

472
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,200
I got a big one on swap files, Matt.

473
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,480
Are you ready for a little more?

474
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,520
I think I'm ready.

475
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
I can only imagine.

476
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,800
So, there's only one way to take a swap conversation and make it better and that's to bring in

477
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,320
ZRAM and Hibernate, right?

478
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,280
I mean, that's really going to take the next...

479
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Oh no.

480
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
Oh boy.

481
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,280
That's just really over-complicating.

482
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
Oh my goodness.

483
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
Okay.

484
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,280
Alright, so Kevin writes in.

485
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,280
Hey Kevin.

486
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
He says, Hi Chris and Matt.

487
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,520
I'm glad you brought up the topic of swap.

488
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,760
Despite the beardiness of the topic, it's something I've been following since SSD price

489
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,600
drops and 2GB of RAM have made a swappable system not just possible, but perhaps desirable.

490
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,120
With the community having a greater experience about it, I wanted to toss around a few ideas

491
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,800
to the Jupyter broadcasting audience.

492
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,440
Alright, Matt, so I'm going to activate our Mumble Room for this one too so that way they

493
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,440
can answer.

494
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
Alright.

495
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,840
So, question number one and I pose this to the Mumble Room.

496
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,560
I've heard good things about ZRAM, but I don't want to spare a machine to test on it yet.

497
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,840
Has anyone replaced your swap file with ZRAM?

498
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,680
Will it work with Hibernation?

499
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,580
Is performance under heavy load better than disk-based swap?

500
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,800
Anyone in the Mumble Room tried ZRAM yet?

501
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
If only Ant was here.

502
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:35,760
I tried it on, I have an AC100, which is a Toshiba ARM-based laptop shipped with Android

503
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,920
and we replaced Android with Ubuntu and memory was a bit tight.

504
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:50,000
So we used ZRAM or ZRAM as we call it over here and really didn't notice any difference

505
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
at all.

506
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's fine.

507
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,240
And how much RAM do you think the system, do you remember how much it had in it, physical

508
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
RAM?

509
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
A gig.

510
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Oh gosh, I have no idea.

511
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
Okay.

512
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
Two, five, six maybe.

513
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,240
It's either 512 or a gig because I remember looking at it, it's a Tegra 2-based system.

514
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,720
Yeah, it's pretty lean.

515
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Yeah.

516
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
Okay.

517
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,800
The other thing to note is that ZRAM does not fix the Hibernation problem.

518
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Oh, okay.

519
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Yeah.

520
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
Okay.

521
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
This period does not fix it.

522
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
Okay.

523
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,040
There is no way to currently hibernate, which does not require you to write to disk at some

524
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,800
point your contents of RAM.

525
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
Right.

526
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Because you're powering down the RAM.

527
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Exactly.

528
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
Yeah.

529
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Another thing.

530
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,520
No, I don't get why there isn't some solution that creates like on Windows creates a Hibernation

531
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:36,000
file separate from swap if you don't wish to have a large swap file that matches the

532
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
amount of RAM you have.

533
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yeah, let's go.

534
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,600
Another thing I've been noticing just on my main machine is that ever since kernel 3.8

535
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,440
for some reason, ZRAM causes a kernel panic when enabled.

536
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,440
What?

537
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,720
And sometimes just randomly it'll kernel panic and I don't even know why.

538
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,520
What distro is this?

539
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
Any distro.

540
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,440
With anything after 3.8?

541
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
Anything after 3.8.

542
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
That is weird.

543
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,440
Linus, dammit.

544
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
No.

545
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,080
Okay, now here's, let's talk about swap files specifically.

546
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,240
So Kevin wants to know, is there a big difference between swap files and swap partitions?

547
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,000
If the system partition and swap are on the same disk, I can't see where an improvement

548
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,240
would be, especially since I could remove or add swap files with much less hassle than

549
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,800
a swap partition.

550
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,240
Now I have a theory, but has anybody actually tried swap files?

551
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
No.

552
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,120
All right, so here's my theory on the swap partition.

553
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,720
This is just a raw space that the kernel can write to.

554
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,320
And I gotta believe that is faster than going through the file system driver and whatever

555
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,020
it is, BotRFS extended for, I have to believe it is a much more direct connection when you

556
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:50,960
have a raw partition space that is just only for swap.

557
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
That would be my belief.

558
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
You would think so.

559
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,720
Yeah, I mean, you would think it would be a straighter shot anyhow.

560
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
Yeah.

561
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,100
All right, so he goes on to ask about USB 3.0 flash drives being cheap enough and maybe

562
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,320
storing swap on there.

563
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
No.

564
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,060
See, the one problem with USB is that it uses the CPU for the controller logic, so you're

565
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,640
gonna have CPU load for doing that.

566
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,360
I just don't think that's a good idea in general.

567
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,720
He said, it sounds like some of the Mumble members would go swappless if not for Hibernate,

568
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,160
and he includes a link where we can find out more information from the Debian Wiki.

569
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,160
How about that?

570
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
A plug for the Debian Wiki.

571
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,160
Woo!

572
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,600
On at least running Debian Hibernate without a official swap file.

573
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,600
So there you go.

574
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,320
All right, so he says, thanks for relieving my ramblings.

575
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,840
Well, Kevin, thank you for emailing in.

576
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,840
That was a good one, right?

577
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
Yeah, very good.

578
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,640
I thought that was a good little topic.

579
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
All right.

580
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
Really well thought out too, I think.

581
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,680
Yeah, it's funny how, like, there's just the semantics, you know, where you think about

582
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
these kind of things.

583
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,320
Like, honestly, when I was resetting up this Ultra Pro, I was like, should I make a swap

584
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,320
partition?

585
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,320
Right?

586
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,320
Yeah, exactly.

587
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,320
Yeah.

588
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
Yeah.

589
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,720
Unless you're running, like, openSUSE and you just import what you're working with.

590
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,960
Yeah, I mean, I decided to go for it, but yeah.

591
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
Okay.

592
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
All right.

593
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,760
Well, I wanted to remind everyone that we'll be doing a double recording on Tuesday the

594
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,640
17th, starting at 12 p.m.

595
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,640
So we're gonna start early.

596
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,640
Oh, boy.

597
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,640
Don't forget, man.

598
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,440
I almost, I actually forgot until I read that.

599
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,760
I got multiple entries in my phone as well as other, actually, both of my smartphones.

600
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,760
And they beep and squeal all day long, so I don't forget.

601
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,760
Yeah, you know, so, okay.

602
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
Here's what we're gonna do.

603
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:23,840
We're gonna start at 12 p.m. Pacific over at jblive.tv next week, on Tuesday the 17th.

604
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,960
We won't be live on the 24th, which is Christmas Eve.

605
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,920
So we're pre-recording.

606
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:36,280
And I'll tell you, this show, having no topics and just going off the cuff is fine for one

607
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
episode.

608
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,280
Yeah.

609
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
I don't know about two episodes.

610
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
It might devolve into another Star Trek review.

611
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
No, I'm kidding.

612
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,040
But show up and hang out in our mumble room.

613
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,440
You'll have more opportunities to do so.

614
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,000
So I'll go to that.

615
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,600
Matt, speaking of opportunity and things that you've been dealing with, I know, were you

616
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,200
dealing with car troubles earlier today?

617
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
Okay.

618
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Yeah.

619
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
I mean, just keeping it real loose here.

620
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,040
Basically, I had, I known for some time, and I'm sure Ange and Chris have certainly heard

621
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,200
it as I'm pulling in or pulling out, my car likes to squeal like it's dying a horrible

622
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,200
painful death.

623
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,160
You know, I have a trusted mechanic, a very good guy here locally that I take it to top

624
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
of the line fella.

625
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,680
Well, anyway, shaving a few things off, even relying on a battery warranty, I'm looking

626
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,720
at just under $1,000.

627
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,520
Oh my gosh.

628
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Yeah.

629
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,000
And it's like, I'm literally going to be delivering phone books to pay for it right

630
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
now.

631
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,480
So, you know, so you got to do the balance.

632
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
For the belt?

633
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
For the belt?

634
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

635
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
I need a new axle.

636
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
What?

637
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
I got all kinds of stuff.

638
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,840
I actually went, I went to, I had a second mechanic look at it to make sure.

639
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,200
And yeah, it's the real deal.

640
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,520
There's a number of things that are going to be, I'm going to see what the timing belt,

641
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
I think it's the other one or time.

642
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
Yeah.

643
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
Timing belt was the other one.

644
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,520
There's a number of things I'm looking at.

645
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:51,920
So yeah, so definitely been, you know, just one of those tough life lessons, but the good

646
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,120
news is, is it's going to be possible.

647
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
So that's what's awesome.

648
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,320
Man, I'll tell you what, so car problems and they have a great way of coming like at the

649
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
worst time ever.

650
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Well, it's December, right?

651
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,520
I mean, clearly this is what you do.

652
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,200
Now do you have like a business that you can like say that the vehicles for the business

653
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
travel?

654
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,960
No, at one time, yes, but not anymore because I don't, because I don't work outside of the

655
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
house really.

656
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,400
I mean, I do kind of, but not really as much as I used to, I don't just mathematically

657
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,240
the count actually said it's easier to go this other way.

658
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,640
Rethinking that now, but no, I really can't.

659
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,680
So you know, it's just, it's just one of those things to where you just got to, you know,

660
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,160
stomach it and move on.

661
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Yeah.

662
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,760
And so, you know, I mean for us, the biggest upset has been this whole Amazon affiliate

663
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,760
thing.

664
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,760
Yeah.

665
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,160
And it's been interesting because when I set up the Amazon affiliates program, I set up

666
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,240
like four or five of them.

667
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,240
I can't remember.

668
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,480
I set up like, I think it was four because I was going to do an affiliate ID for each

669
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
show.

670
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Yeah.

671
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,480
And then I realized the way the Amazon system works is by traffic base.

672
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,360
So if you have everybody use one affiliate ID, you get, you know, better results, which

673
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,360
is totally legit.

674
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Yeah.

675
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,760
So I had all these other accounts available.

676
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,400
So when they shut down our account, I still had these other ones.

677
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,800
So I thought, okay, let's see how these go.

678
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,740
Of course, they've all, they were all systematically shut down within a period of time, including

679
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:12,160
my wife's account, which is on her mom vault.com blog, completely unrelated to Jupiter broadcasting.

680
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,400
It's just her own personal blog where she sells.

681
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,720
If she talks about a mom product, a mommy product that she bought from Amazon, she'll

682
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,840
put a link to it with the affiliate ID, but it's like straight up like that's all she

683
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,840
uses it for.

684
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,840
Yeah.

685
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,120
It's not involved with our company at all.

686
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,160
And they still shut even that account down.

687
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Really?

688
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,800
Is it based on, I wonder if they're like looking at address or what the hell, I mean, or last

689
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
name or I don't understand.

690
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
It's gotta be address, right?

691
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Yeah.

692
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
It's gotta be, right?

693
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,320
I mean, cause you got your 10 versus SSN and all that.

694
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,320
I don't know.

695
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,400
I'll tell you, it comes kind of at a sucky time because so the, the early 2014 window

696
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:50,820
was we were going to start up, I have a townhouse that I own that is currently rented out.

697
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:56,480
And my, my idea was is I will take that townhouse and I will convert it into, I will ask the

698
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,960
renters to vacate and then I will convert it into a studio.

699
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:08,080
And part of that would also be hiring a full time person to operate the studio.

700
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,480
And then what I would do, and this is the part that I really want to do, and I, even

701
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,040
if we can't do the new studio, I still want to figure out a way to do this.

702
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:20,360
So I'm putting the call out to the Linux unplugged audience is I want to take Tuesdays and I

703
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:26,600
want to go on location to a company in the greater Seattle area that is using Linux.

704
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
Ah, yeah.

705
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,400
I mean, valve would be the dream, right?

706
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
Oh yeah, right.

707
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,040
Any company, any company.

708
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,000
And I want, I mean, I'm asking for a lot.

709
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,620
I mean, I realize this upfront, but what I want to do is I want to go there and here's

710
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,800
my thought, man, just totally, it's totally economical in terms of production senses.

711
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,600
I want to go down there on a Tuesday.

712
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,320
I want to spend the morning shooting a segment for the Linux action show.

713
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,120
And then I want to spend the afternoon doing a podcast from their office and maybe bring

714
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,840
in like their sys admin, right?

715
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:58,280
Bring in somebody who works with Linux onsite, have them sit down on microphone with us.

716
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,000
And you know, you could be there in person sometimes and sometimes you'd be on Skype,

717
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,920
whatever, whatever works for you that week.

718
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,160
We bring it all in and we'd have somebody back at the studio who could switch it.

719
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,160
So I'd Skype in.

720
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,040
Maybe I'd buy myself a Galago Ultra Pro and how you utilize this nice webcam.

721
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,040
Woo!

722
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,040
I like that.

723
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,400
So that's, that's my 2014 dream, so I don't know how we're going to pull that off, but

724
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,040
if you are in the Seattle area and you would like to have us come and burden your office

725
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,920
with our presence and abuse your bandwidth and ask you all kinds of personal probing

726
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,240
questions about your Linux infrastructure, email me chris at jupyterbroadcasting.com

727
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,000
because I want to start setting this stuff up.

728
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,640
I want to start doing Linux unplugged on location and then come back with something for last

729
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,000
on Sunday so we can, I mean, I think the opportunities here are great.

730
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,680
Like you'll get the behind the scenes story here on unplugged.

731
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,360
You'll get all of like the nitty gritties, the stuff that we don't tell you about on

732
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,360
last.

733
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,120
Just cause we'll call on last, we'll cut down and give you like, here it is, boom, boom,

734
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
boom.

735
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
Here's the information.

736
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
Here's the interview.

737
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
Here's what they're doing.

738
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,120
But on unplugged, we're going to do it right there on location.

739
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,120
We're going to bring their guys on.

740
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,120
They're going to chat with us and I think this could be a great opportunity.

741
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,400
So if you are in the greater Seattle area, Chris at jupyterbroadcasting.com, let me know

742
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,640
and maybe we'll do an episode on site in early 2014.

743
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,720
I don't know how, I don't know how we're going to pull that off.

744
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,040
Oh yeah, no kidding.

745
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,240
One way we're going to pull it off is we are rocking our, our teespring.

746
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,040
This is, we've exceeded my, my greatest expectations.

747
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,800
We're now at 722 of 499 that we needed to unlock it.

748
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,000
So this, I'm just mentioning it real quick.

749
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,380
You have five days and two hours left as of this recording to grab yourself a Jupiter

750
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:36,400
broadcasting limited 2014 shirt or hoodie or ladies tee.

751
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
Hello.

752
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,680
Oh, it says women's tee.

753
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,440
I think they should put ladies tee in there.

754
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,360
And I think they should say it that way with a little Barry White in the background.

755
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,360
Ladies tee.

756
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,880
Also, I've heard from, from our, from our Aussie viewers and folks in Florida, I'm not

757
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,880
kidding.

758
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,640
They're happy that we have a short sleeve option as well, just a straight up tee.

759
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:59,200
So if you want to get those, teespring.com slash Jupiter 2014.

760
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,400
And if you're listening to this six days from when it was posted, it's too late.

761
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,480
We won't have them anymore.

762
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,520
Before we get in and we got our mumble room back and I'm going to ask the mumble room

763
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,800
if Linux user groups are dead and Matt and I are going to share experiences with some

764
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,320
local Linux user groups who we both love, but we're going to talk about it first.

765
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,080
I want to thank our second sponsor this week and that is digital ocean.

766
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,740
Digital ocean is cloud hosting made simple.

767
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,840
They offer the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

768
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,880
Users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds and pricing plans start at only $5 per month.

769
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:36,520
Which gets you 512 megabytes of RAM, 20 gigs of SSD storage, one CPU and a terabyte of

770
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,880
transfer digital ocean has data centers in New York, San Francisco and Amsterdam.

771
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,880
Hey oh.

772
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,720
The interface is simple, intuitive.

773
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,160
The control panel lets you deploy a droplet super easy.

774
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,160
I have right now an arch server up.

775
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,480
Yes, I said arch.

776
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,380
It's kind of my personal experimentation and I'm going to keep pushing it, see how far

777
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,380
I can take it.

778
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,560
But one of the really cool things is if you want to try something out for a little bit,

779
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,840
digital ocean also offers hourly pricing.

780
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,480
Yes, hourly pricing.

781
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,840
If you want to spin up a cloud server.

782
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,360
I know and what's so awesome is you could create, so like take my arch machine that

783
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,480
I have right now that has BitTorrent sync and other goodies on there.

784
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,200
I have a backup snapshot of that.

785
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:23,360
I can redeploy that dozens of times if I want and only pay hourly and there's something

786
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,600
even better.

787
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:29,600
Listeners of Linux Unplugged can take advantage of a special offer Linux Unplugged December.

788
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,900
Linux Unplugged December will get you a $10 credit when you check out.

789
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,480
Use that promo code at $10 credit.

790
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,280
So if you're using the $5 machine like I am, well that will get you two months of that

791
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,280
$5 machine.

792
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,020
That's a pretty good deal and I invite you to take advantage of it because I didn't actually

793
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,700
fully appreciate how awesome digital ocean was until I spun up a server and I've really

794
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,880
been enjoying it.

795
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,640
Digital ocean also has a really good community and they in fact are trying to encourage that

796
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,220
sort of grow it a little bit and so right now they're offering those of you who want

797
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:01,240
to create articles or tutorials for their community.

798
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,480
If digital ocean selects the piece that you wrote, they'll give you a $50 credit.

799
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,560
You can follow the link in our show notes to find out more about that but if you think

800
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,680
about the baseline server is $5 a month, well if they give you a $50 credit, that's going

801
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,920
to get you going for quite a while and at $5 a month, I'm thinking about taking, so

802
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,980
right now I have an Arch server and one of the criticisms of Arch is that, oh it moves

803
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:26,480
too much and that's scary because apparently we're all scared of our computers.

804
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:32,040
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to also take advantage of Docker, something we talk

805
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,640
about a lot and Matt, my thought is, is why not take Docker and spin it up on Arch and

806
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,040
create an Ubuntu LTS or a CentOS environment in that Docker instance, install things like

807
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,740
Zimbra or whatever sort of productivity suite I want.

808
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:52,280
It lives in this cocoon of protection, this cocoon of long-term support while it rides

809
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,800
on top of that wily and crazy ArchOS and of course DigitalOcean will let you spin up instances

810
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:03,160
with Docker ready to go, also the LAMP stock totally configured CentOS, Ubuntu, they got

811
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,280
a whole bunch on there, go check it out, go over to DigitalOcean.com, Linux Unplugged

812
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,240
December is your promo code to get that $10 credit, that way you can check it out for

813
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:16,560
a couple of months and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

814
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,720
Huge thank you, I love those guys, I love the fact that you have all that freedom and

815
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,800
availability to actually really pick and choose the kind of lifestyle you want to lead in

816
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
the cloud.

817
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,200
And it's so nice for like software development and testing for the hourly pay as you go,

818
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,200
that's super easy.

819
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,560
All right, Mumble Room, are you back?

820
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,560
Are you here?

821
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
Yes, we are.

822
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,520
All right, so let's put your flame retardant pants on and let's have a frank conversation

823
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,600
about the state of Lugs.

824
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,880
Popey very pointedly asked the question on the pre-show, are Lugs dying?

825
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,560
And I think Matt and I both chimed up and said, with much respect and appreciation for

826
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:52,020
both our local Everett and Bellingham Lug, which by the way, our Bellingham Lug puts

827
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,480
on Linux Fest Northwest every year.

828
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,640
So much respect, but sometimes it kind of feels like it's last generation that's left

829
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,640
at these Lugs.

830
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,320
Like, for example, in the Everett Lug, they're kind of famous for these are the guys you

831
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,160
go to when you want to put Linux on a 486, right?

832
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,200
It's not the kind of stuff I'm interested in anymore.

833
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,760
I mean, I have a lot of respect for what they're trying to do and I think it's really cool.

834
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,280
And I kind of want a 486 running Linux in my house, but at the end of the day, to get

835
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,480
my work done, I'm looking at six core i7s, right?

836
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,080
So I wonder to you guys, I want to start maybe Popey, are you still here?

837
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,720
Do you want to share your thoughts on the state of Lugs?

838
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,120
Because you're really the one that kicked this conversation off.

839
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:38,040
Yeah, so this came from, I've been involved in the UK Linux user group scene for a few

840
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,280
years and I've been to my local Linux user groups.

841
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:48,120
There's three in a fairly small catchment area and when I first started going to them,

842
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:53,480
it was, there were lots of talks being given.

843
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:59,920
We would video the talks and we put them online and we'd get like 40 or 50 people in one

844
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:07,680
county Lug coming every month, once a month, and we'd debug people's issues, we'd chat

845
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,920
about various like salient newsworthy things that were going on.

846
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,920
When was this?

847
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,360
What year?

848
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:21,960
This would be probably about 10 or eight years ago, somewhere around about there.

849
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,080
And then over the years, I've kind of noticed it drop off a bit.

850
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:30,120
The amount of traffic in the various mailing lists on all the Lugs in the UK has tailed

851
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
off quite a lot.

852
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,440
I mean, Popey, don't you think maybe the internet is killing the Lug a little bit because we're

853
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,960
more connected now where we go off into our community silos and we just hyper interact

854
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,960
there?

855
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,960
Sure.

856
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,400
And I know when the Linux user group nearest me first started, it was one of these ones

857
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,760
that was a mailing list on the end of a dial up line so you might get a batch of mail every

858
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:58,240
couple of days or something when the guy dialed in and processed all the requests.

859
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,840
And now you can probably get an answer to your question before the modem has finished

860
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,360
negotiating the call.

861
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:12,240
So here's what I worry, though, is there really truly is something to that meat space connection.

862
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,360
When I go to Linux Fest Northwest or I go to PAX and I shake the hand of a Linux action

863
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,520
show listener or I don't know, does Brian2040 leave?

864
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,520
No, I'm still here.

865
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,520
Right.

866
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,120
Like Brian2040, he was a name in the chat room until one day he's driving my truck home

867
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,560
when I'm too sick to drive it, right?

868
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,640
And they become real people.

869
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:36,180
And that meat space connection, I think, is easy to sort of undervalue on the Internet.

870
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,960
And I worry that lugs brought like it like now with like laptops and all this, like lugs

871
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,860
seem like they could do more good than ever.

872
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,860
But I agree with Popeye.

873
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,800
It seems like they've faded big time.

874
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,680
Yeah, and I agree with you.

875
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,240
There is there is that element of personal interaction.

876
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:58,040
And I agree with you that there are some people of an older generation in our local lug.

877
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,440
But that works in both ways.

878
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,200
There's a guy who's recently had to go to hospital and spent time in hospital with a

879
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,200
netbook and found that he it was difficult for him to type.

880
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,120
So, you know, we rallied the troops and sent a mail to the lug and I guess the keyboard

881
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,120
they send him.

882
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,120
Yeah, that kind of stuff.

883
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,800
I feel like the reason why the lugs in my area are populated by the graybeards, the

884
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,120
older guys, is because they're more socially adjusted and they're more socially balanced

885
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,560
because they haven't been perverted by the easiness of the Internet that allows them

886
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,160
to create these fake social connections that don't truly connect them at a human level

887
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
to another person.

888
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,640
What the actual lugs do.

889
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,040
And I feel like we're losing something there.

890
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:42,920
If I may interject, because LinuxFast Northwest was like my first really big festival I went

891
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,680
to, at least in my experience.

892
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:51,640
And you know, from what I've heard and it's just it just in and that sort of environment

893
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,880
where it's more of a development festival almost, it feels like lugs are growing at

894
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,880
the same time.

895
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:06,320
A second ago, he's saying that lugs also were a place where you could actually get help.

896
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,720
And when it got to the point, honestly, like it's so easy to just help yourself now.

897
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,720
Right.

898
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,720
The Google factor.

899
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:18,240
How easy it is to take a USB stick and install it and boot you on it, like you get it done

900
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,720
in 20 minutes by yourself.

901
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,720
Right.

902
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,640
Whereas before you go to a lug to have somebody walk you through the Slackware installation.

903
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,640
Yeah, exactly.

904
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,000
So I don't really I don't really agree with you guys.

905
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,880
Because I'm one of the officers of the lug at UCLA, University of California, Los Angeles.

906
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,720
And at least in my experience, we hold install fest every quarter, we give talks and stuff.

907
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:47,300
And at least in the at least in our academic, like the realm of students and stuff, a lot

908
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,160
of people just are never introduced into Linux.

909
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,680
And then by the time they do in classes or whatever, they are introduced to such a cursory

910
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:01,020
level that they need an extra place to go to to get the kind of help they need.

911
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:05,000
So do you is the majority of your users group a fellow college students?

912
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah.

913
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,240
And then we also have professors and people from around the area.

914
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,760
Okay.

915
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,080
I think a lot of Los Angeles has scale, obviously, which I've been doing a couple times, it's

916
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,800
just an awesome conference.

917
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,360
But it does happen to be I mean, we have media temple and a lot of the big companies that

918
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,960
are very focused on open source software.

919
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,280
But it does seem that a lot of the focus is in the industry and isn't big companies.

920
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:35,480
As far as the community scale, and there's a couple other lugs around LA.

921
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,920
But we're definitely one of the biggest on the west side.

922
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,160
And we're still not very big.

923
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,960
But it I think it helps that we're part of university also.

924
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,080
So do you guys meet on a regular basis?

925
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,920
Yeah, so we have meetings every week.

926
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,920
Okay.

927
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,640
And how was the attendance like on those?

928
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:57,560
So we probably have seven or eight extremely active people who come to every meeting.

929
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:02,040
We have a lot of legacy users and one of the a lot of legacy members.

930
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:07,560
And we have a lot of people hang on to RSC, or I'll come to install fast and stuff.

931
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,160
But in terms of active is maybe 10 people.

932
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:14,400
So it's still not very many that come to every single meeting or whatever.

933
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,400
Go ahead.

934
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:21,160
I mean, I was gonna say, for the longest time, I actually hung out in the IRC of a Linux

935
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,240
user group that started out actually as an Ubuntu Loco.

936
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:29,200
They were Ubuntu Loco Kentucky, and then they went to Bluegrass Linux user group.

937
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,240
It was active for a while.

938
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:35,820
I went to a few meetings in 2011.

939
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,160
But it's really tapered off.

940
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:42,240
A lot of the major members moved down to Texas, I think.

941
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,080
And then I myself ended up moving out to Kansas.

942
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,920
Yeah, see, I found it moved the other way where I am.

943
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:56,100
There was a distinct move from geographically centered Linux user groups, like in the UK,

944
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,360
you have one per county, and I'm sure you have one per state or one per city in the

945
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,120
US.

946
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,880
It moved to a UK wide Ubuntu Loco.

947
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,880
Like I moved that way.

948
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,980
And a lot of people move that way, too.

949
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:15,400
And then there were various other distro specific groups as well, which kind of made the Locos,

950
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:20,000
the Lugs somewhat less populated and less utilized.

951
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,800
Geographically, I have to say, that's probably a lot easier to do in the UK than it would

952
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,120
be in the United States.

953
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:35,640
In my area, the user group in my area is very scarce.

954
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:42,920
So there was one Lug that was here for a couple of years, and it's been just disbanded, but

955
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,760
it's been replaced by a meetup group for just Linux users.

956
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:51,640
Yeah, that's the thing that hindered me from going to a lot of meetings is I was in Louisville,

957
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:56,720
Kentucky, and I was younger at the time, and most of the meetings were over in Lexington,

958
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,360
Kentucky, so a majority of the time, I couldn't make it.

959
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:05,480
Yeah, see, I'm in North Georgia, and of course, as a person that uses Linux that I know personally,

960
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,880
I mean, I don't know him, but Brian, he was probably like an hour from me, just to kind

961
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,600
of give you an example, it's just spread out all over the place.

962
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:19,120
Is there some value in a Linux user's group that exists virtually, like this Mumble Room

963
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,720
right now is as big as some Lug attendees are, right?

964
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,800
And the IRC is many times larger.

965
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:31,000
Right now, 367 people in the IRC right now are chatting about Linux related topics, way

966
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,960
bigger than a local Lug.

967
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:40,320
So is the amount of connectivity and the frequency of connectivity and the availability of information

968
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:46,400
and help, does that in some ways, I guess if the end goal is Linux adoption, if the

969
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,080
end goal is getting people using Linux, doesn't this new model where the Lug plays less of

970
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:55,440
a role still promote Linux on the desktop more?

971
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,440
I completely agree.

972
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,440
I remember that.

973
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:04,320
And the reason being is that in my area, there aren't very many even computer user groups,

974
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:12,720
let alone Linux user groups, or even, I was looking for an Ubuntu Loco for some time ago.

975
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:20,840
The closest one is over the Seattle area, and then there's another one that's in Boise,

976
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,840
Idaho.

977
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,840
That's the next closest.

978
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,840
Right.

979
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,840
That's just how it is here too.

980
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,160
There's like nothing computer-related groups like that.

981
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,600
Yeah, that's a big factor, especially in the US, is there's massive groups of areas that

982
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,360
don't have other technology enthusiast groups.

983
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:41,480
But at the same time, going back to the IRC thing, IRC has been around since like a dawn

984
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,480
of time.

985
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:49,240
So here in Kansas, the closest Linux user group to me is the Kansas City, Missouri one,

986
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,080
although that doesn't seem all that active.

987
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,820
It's more than that, I see.

988
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:02,080
It's like for me, I live in a huge city center, I live in Toronto, and I can't get to their

989
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:07,840
local user group because it's so packed and I'm on such a small time straight.

990
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,840
Interesting.

991
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:16,920
I also think that the idea that an online friendship, an online relationship is a lot

992
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,680
considered a lot more legitimate these days than it was 10 years ago.

993
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,680
True.

994
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:29,480
I remember some five, six years ago when Lug Radio, John O'Bacon, Stuart Langridge podcast

995
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,480
was going.

996
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,480
Right.

997
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:36,760
There's a guy in France, there's an IRC channel and it's still going now, hash lug radio on

998
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,760
free node, long after the podcast finished.

999
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,240
Podcast finished six years ago and the IRC channel is still there and people still come

1000
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:49,040
in there and say, good morning, morning everyone, there's still a community around it.

1001
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:58,680
And I remember Bruno, a guy from France who listened to the podcast and was always in

1002
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:03,160
the IRC channel said, lug radio is my lug.

1003
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:09,200
And this was five, six years ago, he saw this online virtual community as his Linux user

1004
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,920
group, as the people he was empathic with that he could relate to.

1005
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,320
This could be the Irish schnapps talking, but you guys literally are my lug.

1006
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,600
Oh, I love you too.

1007
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,600
I mean, same here.

1008
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,560
You know, Chris, when you mentioned something earlier about, you know, when you met Brian

1009
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:29,760
at the Linux Fest Northwest, you know, that kind of reminded me how earlier this year

1010
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:36,600
I also helped Brian pack his stuff when he was moving from Southern Indiana down to Georgia.

1011
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,600
Right.

1012
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,280
Well, that is really the interesting thing is there are members in like our IRC chat

1013
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,360
room that have been met up in real life.

1014
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,240
Like Brian, didn't you meet up with Mail Hauler?

1015
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,240
Twice, actually.

1016
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:54,560
Met up with Tyler, Mail Hauler and his entire family and you, Angela, and Ty the Geek over

1017
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,560
at Linux Fest.

1018
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,560
So yeah, lots of people.

1019
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:02,600
I mean, it is hard out going home for Brian too from Atlanta.

1020
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:07,200
I actually plan on certain early this year saving up to get a plane ticket to head out

1021
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,320
towards Linux Fest Northwest in April.

1022
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,320
Oh, man.

1023
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,320
Awesome.

1024
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,880
See, this makes me want to get the studio started up because then we could have like

1025
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,160
a spot for everybody to come hang out after Linux Fest Northwest.

1026
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,160
That would be cool.

1027
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,160
Yeah, I would love to go up there too.

1028
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,160
Yeah, that would be a lot of fun.

1029
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:26,000
What's happened to Lugs is that all the simple support stuff has gone online and now it's

1030
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:33,480
just the dedicated users that go to these hyper-focused events like hackerspaces or

1031
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,080
in their towns or these conventions.

1032
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:39,760
See, hackerspaces are different though because hackers are like more like computer centric

1033
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,760
focused.

1034
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:51,520
So there's a big overlap there though, if I go to any of my hackspaces nearby, they're

1035
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,280
the same kind of people like, you know, people who want to take things apart and make them

1036
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:01,280
work the way they want to don't necessarily want to use devices the way that the manufacturer

1037
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,280
intended.

1038
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,280
They're the same kind of ethic that we have.

1039
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,720
Yeah, it is.

1040
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,720
So I totally agree with Popeye because at least in LA, we have DevOps LA meetups and

1041
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:16,720
different infrastructure like industry type user groups and in many ways, I think those

1042
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:24,160
have replaced the Lug movement because as more and more people want Linux professionals,

1043
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:28,320
they kind of congregate within their own professional groups rather than these informal Lug type

1044
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,320
situations.

1045
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:35,400
Well, and it's interesting too as new Linux based technologies take off like Android online,

1046
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,720
the communities solely seem to be forming online, right?

1047
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,040
And very large ones like the XDA form.

1048
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:45,480
Oh, Bruce Phoenix actually just had an awesome idea.

1049
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,960
What if you got your new studio and turn it into a Jupiter broadcasting hackerspace?

1050
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,360
Oh, that would be cool.

1051
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,920
You know, we would have a garage so there is possibilities.

1052
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:02,680
And you know, if you made that new studio, you could have a couple interns too.

1053
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:07,400
All right, well, interesting thoughts.

1054
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,400
You know, I'd love to hear also if anyone out in the download audience has experience

1055
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,980
with a local Linux users group or runs one or is involved with one.

1056
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,980
We'd love to hear what you think.

1057
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,500
Go over to Jupiterbroadcasting.com and pop that contact link at the top of the site.

1058
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,000
There is actually a Linux unplugged drop down there.

1059
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,440
Any other closing thoughts you guys like on the Lug topic?

1060
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:33,320
I have all I got to say is coming April, party at the J.B. studio.

1061
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,320
Yeah, I agree.

1062
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,320
All right, Matt.

1063
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:41,960
Well, also, when it comes to things, well, I was going for most of this topic.

1064
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:47,160
Well for me, all those groups, all those groups, they're more of the follow up from the old

1065
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:54,320
school computer clubs that used to do the old hardware stuff and the old OS stuff.

1066
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,760
I wouldn't discount them because of that, though.

1067
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,960
Well, they never had the Internet back at that time.

1068
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,960
No, I agree.

1069
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,960
It was just being like invented.

1070
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,600
But there is something about seeing somebody else do something in Linux that makes you

1071
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,640
go, oh, I could do that when you see it happen.

1072
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,640
I'll tell you this.

1073
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,160
The reason I say this is because for years I went to clients and a few of these clients

1074
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:20,540
I would have like the tech savvy guy or gal that worked there who was like the tech person

1075
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:21,740
for the company.

1076
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:27,200
And when she would see Compiz on my Linux machine, that was the coolest thing ever.

1077
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,920
And that made her or him want to run Linux.

1078
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:36,920
If I can say something, honestly, that kind of concept is what actually, because I'd say

1079
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,200
my first experience with that was actually watching the Linux action show.

1080
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,400
That's kind of how I got into it in the first place.

1081
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,800
And now you're spinning out your own distro.

1082
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,800
Yes.

1083
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,800
Yeah, that's interesting.

1084
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,320
So I think for myself, what really killed the whole Lug situation really comes down

1085
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,320
to the following.

1086
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:58,600
I poked in and out of the Bellingham Lug for a few years, just real occasional.

1087
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:05,680
And I found it remarkable how it felt like Groundhog Day, no new faces, always the same

1088
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,400
folks, great folks, awesome people.

1089
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,320
But it was just the same thing over and over.

1090
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,720
And honestly, it's like even online, it's hard to get that stale.

1091
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:19,320
So for me, I stopped attending just because I was really not getting anything new from

1092
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,320
it.

1093
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,880
Everybody used OpenSUSE, and if you didn't, you weren't, or not OpenSUSE, but a SUSE

1094
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,880
at the time.

1095
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,880
It was very much an echo changer.

1096
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,520
Yeah, I could see the echo chamber in the same old stories over and over again.

1097
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,260
So that sounds like a Lug that's kind of given up on recruiting.

1098
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,320
And they're kind of in a rut.

1099
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:41,480
Because we've had an experience where this year we did a pretty heavy recruiting drive

1100
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:46,680
with all the club fairs and stuff at our school.

1101
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:51,440
It's basically just about you need to, because we're in a room in the bottom of the engineering

1102
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,960
building and unless you know about us, unless you have discovery, no one's going to know

1103
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,960
we're here.

1104
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:03,400
I would say from what you're saying is that the Lug is most likely to live on the best

1105
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,400
in a college campus.

1106
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,400
Yeah, I would agree with that.

1107
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:13,560
And the thing is, is the college campus doesn't really, as much as, I totally dig that Cognizant

1108
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,040
was talking about a Lug and that's awesome, but to me it seems like it's only successful

1109
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,960
because you kind of have a captive audience.

1110
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,160
It's easy to message to them because they're all in one location and they're sort of already

1111
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,160
there.

1112
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,160
And you got people churned.

1113
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,160
You got new faces at least.

1114
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,160
Right.

1115
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,160
Oh, great point.

1116
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,840
Isn't that what a business would want if they want to hire people who know Linux?

1117
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:35,680
And they want to team up with somebody who's attracting other young, fresh blood who are

1118
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,680
coming through the colleges?

1119
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,680
It's funny you mention that.

1120
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:44,520
It's funny you mention that because that's one of the primary reasons we exist.

1121
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:51,040
Our school is a typical high level CS department where they really don't teach a lot of practical

1122
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,040
skills.

1123
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:57,400
Because in CS and academic levels, almost like math, it's like math for computer programs.

1124
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:03,920
And to teach, like for example, I've been doing a lot of work professionally with Puppet

1125
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,720
and very different DevOps, vagrant stuff, type CS integration stuff.

1126
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,080
And those are skills that I basically taught myself.

1127
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:18,080
And I've gotten jobs because I've known these skills from teaching myself.

1128
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:22,640
And when there's an interest group where we give talks about these things and we have

1129
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,240
other people who are interested in them, like I've had, I'm not going to name names, I think

1130
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:31,040
it's probably not the best thing, but we've had very massive companies come and trying

1131
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,240
to partner directly with us and give sponsor talks and things to try and attract our members.

1132
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,340
So they're looking for talent.

1133
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,560
They're looking for hires?

1134
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,560
Yeah.

1135
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:43,800
So like I've gotten three jobs from, I don't know, I don't know if it's directly from the

1136
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:51,200
Lug, but it's from just knowing these things and having that kind of interest.

1137
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,520
That actually makes a lot of sense, right?

1138
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,920
Because these companies don't know quite how to find these people.

1139
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,840
And a Lug is something they can see, something they understand, something they can approach

1140
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,440
and they can come to the Lug and say, we're looking for somebody who is talented NGINX

1141
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,160
and et cetera, et cetera, right?

1142
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,680
So this is something that is actually, I was talking to the Facebook recruiter and she

1143
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:15,480
was telling me, okay, so Facebook has this position called production engineer.

1144
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:20,720
And the reason this position exists is because the software engineers they hire don't know

1145
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:27,160
enough about the infrastructure backbone to make the kind of decisions they have to make

1146
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,000
about how will this application run in production.

1147
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,760
And so a lot of what happens is a software engineer will end up learning a lot of these

1148
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,200
skills after they've been on the job for a while and then transition to this role.

1149
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:44,280
Well, another thing is if you remember at Linux Fest Northwest, Chris, that lots of

1150
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:48,480
job recruiting people are also there like Dice.com was there.

1151
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,480
Yeah.

1152
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,480
Yeah, it's true.

1153
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,360
That's a great point.

1154
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:56,240
And I think part of that is because some of these companies have their foot in the old

1155
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,080
world and they really haven't figured out how to approach a community.

1156
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:03,920
Like if you think about it, like if you were trying to hire a sys admin or you're trying

1157
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,160
to hire somebody to take care of your backend infrastructure, dude, I would totally troll

1158
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,320
the Linux action show subreddit, but these companies haven't figured it out, right?

1159
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:16,480
They haven't figured it out, but what they have figured out is Lugs and user conferences.

1160
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,480
That's a great point.

1161
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,520
I didn't even think about.

1162
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,640
And now that I think about it, if I was going to hire somebody for like to handle the Jupiter

1163
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:27,200
broadcasting backend, that's probably where I would look to actually.

1164
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,840
Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.

1165
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,920
Yeah, it does make a lot of sense.

1166
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,100
I never even thought about the employment aspect.

1167
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:37,520
And so, I mean, that's probably another argument for like, how do we figure out how to rejuvenate

1168
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,160
the Lug and does it need to be rebooted?

1169
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,160
Okay.

1170
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,160
Let me ask.

1171
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,160
Okay.

1172
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,160
Mumbo room.

1173
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,160
Let me ask you this and Popey, I want to start with you because you're the one that brought

1174
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,160
up the topic.

1175
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,200
So I think you should get first shot at this.

1176
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,960
Would a Google Hangout replace a Lug?

1177
00:58:50,960 --> 00:59:01,240
No, because the people that you want to get involved are highly opinionated and the kind

1178
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,480
of people who wouldn't touch Google Hangouts with a barge pole.

1179
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,480
Well, okay.

1180
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,360
I'll give you that on the last part.

1181
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,040
But let's look at the Ubuntu Developer Summits.

1182
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:15,200
You guys have moved to these virtual summits and you're still getting a lot of stuff done.

1183
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,880
There's a lot of discussions that are happening.

1184
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,400
People are able to attend because they're able to just connect in.

1185
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,360
You're seeing each other face to face.

1186
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,500
I mean, there's productivity happening there.

1187
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,400
Isn't it better than nothing?

1188
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:35,700
Yeah, but UDS is a very different animal than Lugs.

1189
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:43,000
And we all have Google accounts by virtue of the fact that we have a Google set up.

1190
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,480
Oh, that's a good point.

1191
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,560
Not everybody has a Google account.

1192
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:52,800
But Lugs are the place where you find people who buy Android phones and then immediately

1193
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:58,640
flash them so they don't ever have to connect to Google or the kinds of people who refuse

1194
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,640
to have smartphones.

1195
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:04,000
I'm not saying there's anything bad about that, but it's a different type of person

1196
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
in a Lug.

1197
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
All right.

1198
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Isn't that the problem?

1199
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,960
Don't we need to reboot the Lug and make it more modernized that way guys like me who

1200
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:15,060
want as I want a 12 core processor, maybe I want two of them in my box, I want 64 gigs

1201
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,060
of RAM.

1202
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:17,400
Why don't we reboot the Lug for that guy?

1203
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,400
So you're saying that's exactly what to turn it into.

1204
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,680
Having it turn into a hack fest type thing would be more similar to the old school's

1205
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:26,680
Lug.

1206
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:32,240
At the same time though, that's like Linux was for those people who wanted not to use

1207
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,240
them.

1208
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:37,000
Like it's for open and free software and not like hangouts.

1209
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,080
Also, when you're in some person, all the creative juices happen a little bit better

1210
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:45,880
and you're more competitive when you're in person versus just the internet.

1211
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:46,880
That's interesting.

1212
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:55,560
It makes you think better and harder about what the hell to counteract this guy's idea.

1213
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:03,680
A few years ago on OMG Ubuntu, which is a popular blog you may have heard of, Benjamin

1214
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:11,040
Humphrey who used to write for them wrote a post about neck beards and he got a massive

1215
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:17,700
negative feedback from the community because he was basically having a pop at people in

1216
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:25,100
the way that you're suggesting that we should move on and maybe we should involve younger

1217
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:32,600
blood who want faster processors and the JavaScript and that kind of thing of today rather than

1218
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,720
COBOL and mainframes and 26s.

1219
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:39,920
You are blaming me for stereotyping when you are saying that all these people at Lugs are

1220
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:47,400
old school mainframe COBOL guys and I'm saying that stereotyping of Lug, you are really sir.

1221
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,400
Really sir.

1222
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,400
What I'm saying is that he made that kind of suggestion and he got a lot of flack for

1223
01:01:52,400 --> 01:02:01,420
it and rightly so because what the reaction was actually that people, what you're doing

1224
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:08,160
now and in the future is built on the shoulders of what the people did before you.

1225
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:13,240
If those Lugs didn't exist three years ago, ten years ago, then your podcast wouldn't

1226
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,240
exist.

1227
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,240
Yeah, isn't that true?

1228
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,240
Do you see what I mean?

1229
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,240
Yeah, I do.

1230
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,240
What's come out of this to me is that you need...

1231
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:22,000
This podcast is almost like the recording of a huge Lug meeting.

1232
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:29,480
I'd say a community though has to center itself around far more than just a Google Plus hangout.

1233
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:32,520
There needs to be more substance to it.

1234
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:36,080
But you've also got to have, you've got to close the loop locally like what's happening

1235
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,720
at Cogsues College, so you need two separate things.

1236
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:44,040
The online stuff is going to solve itself and happen and is happening right now, but

1237
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,120
you need to close the loop locally.

1238
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:50,560
I think you might be onto something there because going back to the Linux Fest Northwest,

1239
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:56,520
it's like it is truly one thing to know these people and hear their voices, but to actually

1240
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:02,000
shake their hand, see them as a human with their flaws and with their pluses that you

1241
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,120
never knew about until you saw them personally.

1242
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:10,800
Like I really, really love my truck, okay?

1243
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:19,360
I really love my truck, and I gave the keys to my truck to Brian2040, and I think that

1244
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,980
no other man, maybe with the exception of one or two other men, have ever driven my

1245
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,000
truck and will never drive my truck.

1246
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,280
I will make that point right now, will never drive my truck, but I gave it to Brian2040.

1247
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:33,760
Part of it was because I knew him in the IRC, but then I met him and there's a connection

1248
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,400
that is made.

1249
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,400
And it's interesting, I think-

1250
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,400
Get a room.

1251
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:43,680
I remember Chris standing out there with a food box in his bathroom, but you also had

1252
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,440
to point out you were violently ill as well, so-

1253
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,440
I was quite sick.

1254
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,440
My options were limited.

1255
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,440
That is true.

1256
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:51,760
I remember very clearly as Chris looks me dead in the eyes, deadpan serious, and says,

1257
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,760
dude, I don't feel good.

1258
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:53,760
And I was like, oh, okay.

1259
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,480
I was like, no, Matt, really, I don't know what's going to happen, and I'm just like,

1260
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,480
oh, crap.

1261
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,640
Yeah, we were actually all concerned because Chris went out into his car and then it was

1262
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,640
just nothing for like two hours.

1263
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,640
Yeah.

1264
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,640
It was funny.

1265
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,640
He died.

1266
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,640
I kept thinking like, I'll get better.

1267
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,640
I'll get better.

1268
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,640
I'll be all right.

1269
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:14,640
I'll be okay.

1270
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:18,200
But I will tell you that it wasn't for Angela coming in and basically looping all of us

1271
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,920
together, because we're a bunch of trained monkeys going in circles.

1272
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:24,060
She was the one that set us straight and made sure we got things done.

1273
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,800
So I got to give props to her on that one, big time.

1274
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,800
Big time.

1275
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,800
I'll be all right.

1276
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,800
It's just a flesh wound.

1277
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:30,800
Yeah.

1278
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:31,800
Yeah, exactly.

1279
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,800
Exactly.

1280
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:33,800
Oh, yeah.

1281
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:34,800
No, he was so...

1282
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,800
I felt so bad.

1283
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,160
I totally see the closing the loop argument.

1284
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,900
But unfortunately, that's not a practical...

1285
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:46,100
So people listening to us in the UK, they can't realistically attend Linux Fest Northwest

1286
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,120
and shake our hands.

1287
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,480
So I want to offer something to them.

1288
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:53,040
I want to say to them that even though you're not visiting the Lug, you're still part of

1289
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,960
an overall larger community.

1290
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:55,960
Yeah.

1291
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:56,960
Hugs for Lugs.

1292
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:57,960
Hugs for Lugs.

1293
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:04,880
What you need is you need to start a fundraiser so you could take a trip with the family over

1294
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,760
to the United Kingdom to have a meetup there.

1295
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,880
Once I get the staying on the air thing figured out and the studio thing figured out and the

1296
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:16,240
doing Linux action shows and Linux unplugged on location thing figured out, then it's the

1297
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,640
travel to the UK thing I got to figure out.

1298
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:23,200
So Chris, let me know when you're coming over to the UK so I can go to another country.

1299
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,200
Ouch.

1300
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:28,080
The poppy that hurts on the inside, deep down.

1301
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,080
Wow.

1302
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,080
We're Americans.

1303
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:33,640
We like our little angry bubble.

1304
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:36,480
All right.

1305
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,480
We love our ignorance.

1306
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,480
Okay.

1307
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,480
Now, this is...

1308
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,480
This is the...

1309
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,480
Oh, boy.

1310
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,480
These are the final thoughts.

1311
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,960
You know, the Linux action show went down to the Ubuntu one conference back when they

1312
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,360
did these things in the meet space and that was a good time.

1313
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,860
That was actually a really good time.

1314
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:51,860
So all right.

1315
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:52,960
Any final thoughts, you guys on the Lug?

1316
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,680
I know Ixl, you were thinking about...

1317
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:58,520
Ixl, what you think about starting the Lug on your own?

1318
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:05,240
I thought about it and kind of played around with the idea, but with me moving, there's

1319
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,880
no real sense in doing it over here.

1320
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,720
So I mean, if there's anybody else like in the chat room, I saw somebody else from the

1321
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,720
Spokane area.

1322
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,720
Oh, he just found spokane-linux.org.

1323
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:14,720
How about that?

1324
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,280
That's actually pretty cool.

1325
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,280
All right.

1326
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:22,840
Well, it's an interesting topic and it's one that I'd love to hear the audience sort of

1327
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:23,840
at large.

1328
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:29,080
Like, I wonder if maybe because we're living on the West Coast, we're right by...

1329
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:33,720
I mean, I think I could get to Microsoft in 45 minutes if traffic was good.

1330
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,560
You could throw rocks at them from the house.

1331
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:39,640
So maybe they're interfering with my thought process just because of the proximity.

1332
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:44,000
So if you are living out there and you have a rocking Lug, we'd love to hear about it.

1333
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,360
And I know they're out there, like our Bellingham Lug puts on Linux Fest Northwest every single

1334
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,120
year and those guys are awesome.

1335
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:53,800
The Everett Lug is nearby and they're working out on some pretty cool stuff, but I'd love

1336
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,800
to hear what you guys are doing.

1337
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:59,800
So go over to jupitabroadcasting.com and pop that contact link and let us know what's happening

1338
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,800
in your neck of the woods.

1339
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:05,600
And don't forget, we're doing a double back, back-to-back special of Linux Unplugged next

1340
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,600
week.

1341
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:07,600
So join us for that.

1342
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,800
We'd love to get you in the mumble room.

1343
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:13,280
That'll be on the 17th starting at 12 p.m. Pacific over at jblive.tv.

1344
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,400
Don't know what time that is in your local area?

1345
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,400
That's okay.

1346
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,400
It's okay.

1347
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:22,840
We've got a jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar and it uses secret technology that automatically

1348
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,680
converts it to your local time zone.

1349
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,160
I don't even know how that's possible.

1350
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,160
It's some sort of...

1351
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,160
Munchkins and gremlins.

1352
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,560
It's some sort of, yeah, exactly, right?

1353
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:34,760
I think we've had munchkins and gremlins that have been working on our website named Hymer

1354
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,320
16 and they are incredible.

1355
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:40,720
All right, Matt, well coming up on Sunday, we'll have a look at the Leopard Extreme.

1356
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,080
I'm punishing it right now as we speak.

1357
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:49,640
So and I know we've got more to talk about too so I want everybody to go over to jupitabroadcasting.com

1358
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,960
and go watch our last episode of Linux Action Show if you didn't catch that and then tune

1359
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:53,960
in next week.

1360
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:58,180
We've got a big one where I'm taking the Leopard Extreme, the real System76 Mac Pro competitor

1361
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:00,840
and we'll see how it holds up to a production workload.

1362
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:01,840
Definitely.

1363
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,840
All right, Matt.

1364
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:03,840
Well, I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

1365
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:04,840
See you on Sunday.

1366
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:05,840
Okay, everyone.

1367
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,600
Thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1368
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,400
We'll see you on Sunday for the big show and we'll see you right back here on Tuesday

1369
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,960
for the next episode of Linux Unplugged.

1370
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,960
Thanks so much.

1371
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:14,960
Take care.

1372
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:43,960
Bye-bye.
