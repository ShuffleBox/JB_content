00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
Hey, welcome. I'm Linus Torvalds, and I started Linux in 1991.

00:04.880 --> 00:10.640
One of the more interesting parts about Linux is how it turns out in the most unexpected places.

00:10.640 --> 00:15.840
Wait a minute. Is he doing our bit? Is he doing our run's Linux bit? Is Linus still in our bit?

00:15.840 --> 00:20.160
So when I started Linux, I needed an operating system for my own use.

00:20.160 --> 00:27.440
And today you find Linux everywhere in small embedded devices, supercomputers.

00:27.440 --> 00:33.520
This technology allows you to expand into many different niches.

00:35.520 --> 00:40.480
This is Linux Unplugged episode 144 for May 10th, 2016.

00:52.160 --> 00:57.280
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's stealing the Unix mindshare.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.520
Every single week. My name is Chris.

00:59.520 --> 01:00.320
My name is Wes.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.360
Right, Wes? That feels about right.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.120
I think so. That's our mission.

01:03.120 --> 01:07.040
Now this week on the Unplugged program, we have a heck of a show for you.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.520
We're doing a heck of a job for you this week, guys, because guess what?

01:09.520 --> 01:14.240
We have big updates from some of our favorite open source projects.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.240
I might be a little cranky. I don't know. So we'll see how that turns out on this week's episode.

01:18.240 --> 01:19.040
Always an adventure.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.400
There's some of these updates, Wes, that I just have a strong opinion about.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.480
Some good, some bad.

01:24.480 --> 01:27.280
Later on in the show, we're going to talk a little more about Linux Mint.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.760
Also, an early look at Fedora 24, a few things you might be interested in.

01:31.760 --> 01:35.680
And one of our favorite open source projects has launched at Kickstarter.

01:35.680 --> 01:41.760
We'll talk about that as well, Wes, as a few other surprises mixed in there.

01:41.760 --> 01:42.160
Yeah.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.160
Mixed in there. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

01:44.800 --> 01:48.240
Episode 144, for those of you who don't know, is a lucky podcast number.

01:48.240 --> 01:52.720
And so Wes was feeling fired up and brought us something from Caldera.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.640
No, not Linux. It's beer.

01:54.640 --> 01:56.960
Opportunity Knox, IPA.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.320
Brewed in Ashland, Oregon.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.040
Yeah. From Oregon. An India Pale Ale.

02:01.040 --> 02:01.680
An Indian Pale...

02:01.680 --> 02:02.160
Okay, here we go.

02:04.560 --> 02:08.160
Now this bad boy is rocking in at 6.8% APV.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.560
You know, and then first on the ingredient list, Mountain Water.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.040
Not regular water. This is Mountain Beer, folks.

02:14.480 --> 02:17.840
All right. So I also... I don't want to bury the lead this week.

02:17.840 --> 02:19.840
We're doing something really important.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.120
This is important work.

02:21.120 --> 02:25.520
We're bringing in one of my favorite all-time computers into the sick bay.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.040
Bring it over here.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.680
We got the Apollo here.

02:31.120 --> 02:37.760
Now over the weekend, PCI SSD in this thing gave up the ghost.

02:37.760 --> 02:40.000
I don't know if it's even more useful to you now.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.040
I don't know if it's the port.

02:41.040 --> 02:46.000
I don't know if it is the card itself or the what.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.080
So I thought, Wes, as the show goes on, we take the pants off the Apollo.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.440
Yeah.

02:51.440 --> 02:52.480
Try a little troubleshooting.

02:52.480 --> 02:53.680
Maybe the card's just loose.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.200
And maybe we can stick it in.

02:55.200 --> 02:55.840
Jam it right in there.

02:55.840 --> 02:58.080
Right. So we've brought... Hold on. Where's our sick bay noise?

02:58.080 --> 03:00.160
Wait. So we've brought it... I say we've brought it... There we go.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.280
We've brought it into the sick bay.

03:02.560 --> 03:08.240
We also have a backup, like one of these PCI SSDs that came with it.

03:08.240 --> 03:12.320
So this is the one that came with the Apollo that has Ubuntu 4.04.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.240
Or I'm sorry, 16.04.

03:14.240 --> 03:21.920
But the one in here, Aftermarket, has Antargos installed, which would be my preferred OS.

03:21.920 --> 03:28.800
So also, Wes, as we get along here, I brought... Hold on, Wes.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.040
There we go.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.640
Thank you. I need that.

03:32.640 --> 03:33.760
Yeah, you do. You do.

03:33.760 --> 03:33.920
I just do.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.760
Because we're in the PC sick bay.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.680
Hey, I spent a long time finding this loop.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.160
I've got to use it.

03:40.160 --> 03:40.880
Yes.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.480
I have your weapon, sir.

03:42.480 --> 03:44.480
Your repair kit, as it were.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.800
So we'll just... Maybe we'll just check in throughout the show.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.960
Bump your microphone a few times as you're going, so that way we know you're working.

03:50.960 --> 03:51.440
Absolutely.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.920
And then we can swap back and forth if we need to, too.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.480
It's not all on you, but I'll just let you start as I get us rolling here.

03:56.480 --> 03:57.040
That sounds good.

03:57.040 --> 04:01.840
Because before we go too much further, and now that our loop has ran out one more time,

04:01.840 --> 04:04.880
it's absolutely time to bring in our mumble room, our virtual lug.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.880
Time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

04:07.760 --> 04:08.080
Hello.

04:08.080 --> 04:08.480
Hello.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.040
Hello.

04:09.040 --> 04:09.440
Hello.

04:09.440 --> 04:09.760
Hello.

04:09.760 --> 04:10.240
Hello.

04:10.240 --> 04:10.640
Hello.

04:10.640 --> 04:11.840
Hello here.

04:11.840 --> 04:12.480
Whoa.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.600
Look at that, dear Wes.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.120
We got ourselves a nice turnout.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.160
Hello, everybody.

04:16.160 --> 04:17.520
It is good to see you.

04:17.520 --> 04:21.440
It's good to see you, our dear friends on the Unplugged program joining us.

04:21.440 --> 04:24.880
Now, I don't know how many of you out there have a PlayStation 4.

04:25.600 --> 04:26.080
I don't.

04:26.640 --> 04:30.560
I've never been particularly interested, but that might just be changing.

04:30.560 --> 04:33.680
And maybe booting up a PlayStation 4 in the not too distant future,

04:34.320 --> 04:38.560
because it looks like it may be possible to run Linux on one of these bad mama jamas.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.280
Now, this is sort of like a layered hack.

04:42.080 --> 04:44.960
It starts with a jailbreak that happened back in December.

04:46.240 --> 04:50.800
Now, for those of you who are not familiar, the PlayStation 4 runs like Orbis OS.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.160
Did you know about this, Orbis OS?

04:52.160 --> 04:52.960
Only a little.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.560
Yeah, it's based on FreeBSD.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.600
The BSD Now guys will make sure you know that if you watch that show.

04:57.600 --> 05:02.320
And Gadget reports that there's a bug in WebKit.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.640
Now, you're able to gain access to the kernel via this bug.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.280
Oh, now here's the catch, though, as like all of these things.

05:09.280 --> 05:17.840
It only works on Orbis 1.74, which is a much older version than the 3.11 that is out right now.

05:17.840 --> 05:22.320
The hardest part about getting Linux on a PlayStation 4 is finding one that...

05:22.320 --> 05:28.240
Hello, hi there, hi, hello, hi, hi, the hardest thing about finding or getting Linux on this,

05:28.240 --> 05:31.040
the hardest thing about this hack is getting an older version of PlayStation.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.560
So it uses this jailbreak.

05:32.560 --> 05:36.240
And now the Cobra team is working on another thing, too, that's going to make it even easier.

05:36.240 --> 05:37.840
It's like a full Linux distro ready to go.

05:37.840 --> 05:41.920
So you've got a jailbreak, then you've got another team that's working on the Linux thing specifically.

05:41.920 --> 05:45.520
And they've been demoing like software running on the PS4 using hardware.

05:46.160 --> 05:50.880
And then on top of that, you got another team that's working on packaging it all up and making it super easy to use.

05:50.880 --> 05:51.840
Oh, that's cool.

05:51.840 --> 05:55.600
Yeah, so there is a lot coming down the pipe for the PlayStation 4,

05:55.600 --> 06:05.200
making it possibly a really cool little powerful Linux compute machine, all thanks to a jailbreak found back in December.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.400
Just one more computer you can run Linux on and not play games.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.400
No, that's mean.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.400
No, it's about dead on here, right?

06:12.400 --> 06:14.400
About that.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.400
Damn it, Wes, damn it.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.400
Is Josh in the virtual log this week?

06:18.400 --> 06:20.400
I don't see him in there, you son of a gun.

06:20.400 --> 06:27.600
I was going to ask him just how much he, how does he get so much damn attention for Solace?

06:27.600 --> 06:29.600
You know, I've been thinking about this.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.600
We go through the headlines every single week.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.600
In fact, I said 30 on the pre-show.

06:33.600 --> 06:43.200
I bet you it was damn near 50 links that between you, myself, and the beard, we went through damn near 50 links, different stories.

06:43.200 --> 06:50.160
And we do like four project updates at the top of Linux Unplugged and we go through like 50 stories to figure out which of the four we're going to put in the show.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.800
And we're just like, you know, which ones do we even feel like talking about?

06:52.800 --> 06:58.800
That's really what's good for us to talk about, what's going to make a good discussion, what's good for the audience to know about.

06:58.800 --> 07:04.800
And one that's always in the news feeds, like almost on a damn weekly basis, you would think, right?

07:04.800 --> 07:10.800
Like out of all the distributions out there, Ubuntu and Linux Mint and OpenSUSE and Arch and Fedora,

07:10.800 --> 07:14.400
if I'm going to tell you one of these distributions in the news every week, you're going to say, oh, well, it's Ubuntu.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.600
Well, maybe.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.600
But one that is surprisingly in the news every single damn week practically is Solace.

07:19.600 --> 07:26.400
And Josh was doing a post over at Solace, they have This Week in Solace, the 28th edition actually,

07:26.400 --> 07:30.400
where he talks about the entire project getting a rebrand in a sense.

07:30.400 --> 07:33.600
A rebrand of a consistent brand, I guess I should say.

07:33.600 --> 07:37.600
And something else, they talk about a brand new software center.

07:37.600 --> 07:41.600
There's no getting around the fact that the software center in Solace 1.1 sucks, Josh writes.

07:41.600 --> 07:48.400
Software discoverability and ease of use for installation of software is incredibly important to us and we want to tackle it with urgency.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.400
So we're doing something about it now.

07:50.400 --> 07:54.400
This cycle. And it's going to be amazing.

07:54.400 --> 08:04.400
Now, is it the way they talk? Is that why we cover, well, not necessarily we, we cover only some of what gets reported on.

08:04.400 --> 08:08.400
Yeah, I mean, it's that combination, like, they have opinions and they're moving fast.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.400
Our current thing sucks and we acknowledge it.

08:10.400 --> 08:14.400
Instead of being all hoity-toity about it and being like, well, there's a lot of priorities.

08:14.400 --> 08:18.400
They're so new. They don't have a lot of image and ego yet.

08:18.400 --> 08:22.400
But their image almost is like, yeah, we'll just tell it like it is.

08:22.400 --> 08:26.400
Yeah, straightforward. I mean, we've talked to them and they are straightforward.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.400
Yeah, we have.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.400
Josh is great.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.400
And so is Ike.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.400
I don't know.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.400
I'm trying to wrap my head around this project though.

08:36.400 --> 08:44.400
Because for an upstart distro built from scratch that's building its own software center from scratch,

08:44.400 --> 08:48.400
we don't talk about it like it's this crazy project that has no chance of succeeding,

08:48.400 --> 08:51.400
that eventually the developers will just burn out and will go away.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.400
We talk about it like it's like in the top ten of distro watch or something.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.400
I don't know. I find it to be fascinating.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.400
What do you think, Rod and Corpse?

08:59.400 --> 09:01.400
We were kind of chatting about an offline a little bit.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.400
I'm curious your thoughts about it.

09:03.400 --> 09:09.400
Yeah, I think it's because they do something that a lot of distros don't do, which is talk about it.

09:09.400 --> 09:14.400
We talk about Solus because Solus talks about Solus.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.400
Like how often do people talk about OpenSUSE?

09:17.400 --> 09:19.400
I don't know.

09:19.400 --> 09:24.400
I mean, OpenSUSE has paid PR people.

09:24.400 --> 09:28.400
OpenSUSE pays to be part of opensource.com.

09:28.400 --> 09:32.400
They have Richard who's on here often and Richard who's all over Reddit during comments.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.400
I mean, they have people out there talking.

09:34.400 --> 09:37.400
In fact, I'd say OpenSUSE has people talking a lot about OpenSUSE.

09:37.400 --> 09:42.400
Yeah, starting last six months ago, probably.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.400
Actually, not even that much, really.

09:44.400 --> 09:49.400
Like when they started talking about the new Leap and the new Tumbleweed stuff,

09:49.400 --> 09:51.400
then it started picking up and people talked about it.

09:51.400 --> 09:55.400
Before that, no one talked about OpenSUSE because they didn't.

09:55.400 --> 09:56.400
Now they're talking about it.

09:56.400 --> 10:00.400
Now Richard is more active in Reddit and here and a lot of places.

10:00.400 --> 10:06.400
But if you look at other distros, how often do they talk about anything?

10:06.400 --> 10:10.400
Like for example, Clem has never done an interview ever.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.400
Right.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.400
No, I guess I see your point to an extent.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.400
They only talk about it when they make a release and that's it.

10:15.400 --> 10:20.400
And so you think it's really just a matter of frequent, hyper-frequent updates?

10:20.400 --> 10:25.400
Well, just the fact that they're open about it and they're – like Wimpy is for Ubuntu Monte.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.400
He's constantly talking about it.

10:26.400 --> 10:30.400
He's available to talk to if you want to in like forums and stuff.

10:30.400 --> 10:34.400
And with Solus, you can go to the Google Plus group or community

10:34.400 --> 10:36.400
and you can talk to them anytime you want to.

10:36.400 --> 10:41.400
And they're more accessible and they're more active in the discussion.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.400
You don't think that delivering, too, also has something to do with it?

10:43.400 --> 10:47.400
Like actually delivering on?

10:47.400 --> 10:50.400
Well, yeah, it's definitely – the way they talk is also interesting

10:50.400 --> 10:54.400
and the way that they're consistently releasing new things

10:54.400 --> 10:57.400
and they're showing you that they are being consistent about it.

10:57.400 --> 11:03.400
But I think it's because that they're more open and transparent about all of the stuff they're doing

11:03.400 --> 11:09.400
gets you more interested in talking to them about it and using it and stuff like that.

11:09.400 --> 11:14.400
So, all right, here we are and we're taking the bottom off the Apollo right now.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.400
Here's what I'm thinking.

11:16.400 --> 11:22.400
I don't think it's loose because the drive is screwed down.

11:22.400 --> 11:26.400
I mean, the little PCI SSD is screwed down with a screw right there.

11:26.400 --> 11:30.400
So it's not a matter of being loose. It's possible it died.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.400
Well, I was hoping it was just not in the slot.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.400
Right, that would be the ideal case.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.400
I mean, maybe it's a little cattywampus.

11:37.400 --> 11:41.400
What do you think, Wes? Is it a little cattywampus in the slot?

11:41.400 --> 11:44.400
Maybe just a little bit?

11:44.400 --> 11:45.400
It could be.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.400
Oh, man, it would save me so much time if I didn't have to reload that machine.

11:48.400 --> 11:54.400
I just reloaded that machine to Arch about a week or two ago.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.400
Well, good point, Rotten, and I say good on them,

11:57.400 --> 12:00.400
and I say good on Josh and all of them for doing a good job with it

12:00.400 --> 12:02.400
because it's still fascinating to follow.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.400
I wasn't trying to make it seem like they weren't doing something good.

12:05.400 --> 12:09.400
It's fantastic. I just want more distros to do it.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.400
Speaking of things that distros should do,

12:12.400 --> 12:16.400
there's not a nice way to talk about this next story.

12:16.400 --> 12:22.400
Manjaro, their SSL certificate expired again.

12:22.400 --> 12:26.400
Can we just set a date to remind ourselves?

12:26.400 --> 12:28.400
Didn't it just happen a year ago?

12:28.400 --> 12:29.400
Just use calendar.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.400
Yeah, I know, right?

12:31.400 --> 12:33.400
Nagios is also very good at this.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.400
Ten days before, just set a reminder.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.400
Yeah, I agree, NorthRanger.

12:37.400 --> 12:42.400
I likely did not dislodge the m.drive, but you never know.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.400
Or maybe they can switch to Let's Encrypt going forward.

12:45.400 --> 12:49.400
Yeah, they say they might switch to Let's Encrypt.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.400
They apologize for the outage.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.400
There's actually a free service you can sign up for

12:53.400 --> 12:57.400
that will notify you just for this particular situation for certificates.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.400
You know what? It's funny.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.400
The Manjaro guy is good on them.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.400
They've built something that people like.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.400
But I got an email or a tweet.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.400
I can't remember what it was now because it all runs together.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.400
I'm sorry.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.400
But I just got a note just before the show started saying,

13:11.400 --> 13:18.400
hey, I love Linux Unplugged, and I switched over to Manjaro because of you guys.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.400
And I thought, oh, close.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.400
Close.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.400
Yeah.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.400
No cigar.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.400
Yeah, I thought, okay.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.400
All right.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.400
Well, that's fine.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.400
You know what? It's great.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.400
And I hope you have fun playing with Arch.

13:30.400 --> 13:31.400
And Manjaro can be whatever you want it.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.400
I think, Ham, aren't you a Manjaro user?

13:33.400 --> 13:35.400
Are you still in the Mumble Room there, Ham?

13:35.400 --> 13:37.400
I can't remember if he – I think he left.

13:37.400 --> 13:41.400
But I know when he was up here for editing, he was a pretty big fan of Manjaro.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.400
He actually likes the slightly delayed updates.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.400
That's one of the things he actually prefers about it.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.400
Okay. Interesting.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.400
I hadn't heard that before.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.400
Yeah.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.400
Yeah, North Ranger.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.400
I don't know what show they listen to.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.400
I thought that was kind of funny, though.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.400
I did like that.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.400
Hey, while we're at it, while we're talking about things that are funny,

13:54.400 --> 13:56.400
you know what's funny?

13:56.400 --> 13:57.400
How much I freaking love DigitalOcean.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.400
Oh, my gosh.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.400
I'm starting to wonder if it's some sort of disorder, Wes.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.400
It's getting embarrassing up in here.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.400
We have been building systems like nuts over DigitalOcean.

14:05.400 --> 14:09.400
Hey, are you still experimenting with the 16.04 over there on the DO?

14:09.400 --> 14:10.400
Oh, yeah, with LexD.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.400
Heck, yeah.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.400
It's great.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.400
Are you using LexD on DigitalOcean?

14:13.400 --> 14:14.400
Yeah.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.400
Oh, that's pretty nice.

14:15.400 --> 14:16.400
It's very convenient.

14:16.400 --> 14:19.400
You can spin up maybe like a $10 rig and just put a bunch of containers on it.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.400
No kidding.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.400
Yeah, it's funny.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.400
When we talk about containers these days, we mostly talk about Docker,

14:23.400 --> 14:25.400
but that's out there and it's ready to go.

14:25.400 --> 14:28.400
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider that is dedicated to offering

14:28.400 --> 14:32.400
the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin up your rig up on their great systems.

14:32.400 --> 14:36.400
They're all SSDs, tier one bandwidth, data centers all over the world,

14:36.400 --> 14:40.400
and if you use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, all one word lowercase,

14:40.400 --> 14:41.400
you get a $10 credit.

14:41.400 --> 14:46.400
That $10 credit will let you try out that $5 rig, two months, absolutely for free.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.400
They have hourly pricing if you just want to try something out for a bit.

14:48.400 --> 14:52.400
If you're watching this live right now, you're watching it through a DigitalOcean droplet.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.400
If you're in our Mumble Room right now, you're on a DigitalOcean droplet.

14:55.400 --> 14:59.400
If you reply to me in the chat, you're replying to me from a DigitalOcean droplet.

14:59.400 --> 15:04.400
And it's just so convenient, you can get them near you in a minute or less.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.400
Yep, yep. And whatever size you need, and if you need to upgrade later,

15:07.400 --> 15:09.400
it's a straightforward process.

15:09.400 --> 15:13.400
Backups and snapshots couldn't be easier because their interface is cray-cray easy.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.400
It's like seriously slick.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.400
They have an API to match it.

15:16.400 --> 15:20.400
And then on top of all of that, redonkly good documentation.

15:20.400 --> 15:23.400
They have senior editors that they have on staff.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.400
Their job is to vet this stuff.

15:24.400 --> 15:28.400
And when community members who are often going to be brilliant,

15:28.400 --> 15:32.400
which probably because a lot of them are you guys, they edit it.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.400
They check it. They vet it.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.400
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.400
Go spin up your next machine on DigitalOcean.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.400
It is fantastic.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.400
One of the things I love too about it now is I have multiple droplets,

15:44.400 --> 15:48.400
many droplets over there, and just managing all of it is so straightforward.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.400
It's nice having it all under one house. Love it.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.400
Clean UI.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.400
Even though I have them in different parts of the world.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.400
This is really cool.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.400
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.400
Big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.400
Okay, Wes, did it boot Ubuntu?

16:03.400 --> 16:04.400
No, it did not.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.400
Oh, no. Really?

16:06.400 --> 16:08.400
So it might be the slot in the motherboard.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.400
Oh, no.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.400
That is a bummer.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.400
I mean, I'm sure Entroware would be up for fixing it,

16:15.400 --> 16:20.400
but the idea of being out without a computer for a couple of weeks is a major bummer,

16:20.400 --> 16:21.400
especially because I just got all those cool stickers on it.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.400
Wait, wait. Let me try.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.400
Are you going into the boot menu right now?

16:25.400 --> 16:30.400
Oh, Wes, this is tight. I don't know what to do.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.400
Mumble room, can someone in there console me?

16:32.400 --> 16:35.400
Come on, tell me it's going to be all right because I'm starting to worry.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.400
Oh, we have Ubuntu.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.400
Oh, okay. So the slot works. Okay. All right.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.400
I haven't screwed on the bottom.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.400
Yeah, that's it. Okay, good.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.400
So should I try the other one again?

16:44.400 --> 16:46.400
I would try shutting it down and putting the other one back in there.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.400
Maybe it just got dislodged.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.400
Right.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.400
What I was talking to Wes about before the show is how great it would be to go out

16:51.400 --> 16:55.400
and do unplugged on location and do OBS from the Apollo.

16:55.400 --> 16:56.400
Have some beers.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.400
Yeah.

16:57.400 --> 16:58.400
Oh, man.

16:58.400 --> 17:04.400
I think that Skylake CPU in there could handle it, but we will find out.

17:04.400 --> 17:08.400
Now, let's shift gears completely and talk about Unity 8.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.400
There's been –

17:09.400 --> 17:10.400
We have to, Chris.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.400
Just a real quick one.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.400
An interesting development, just we'll move on from this,

17:13.400 --> 17:16.400
but Michael Hall, a canonical employee, as most of you know,

17:16.400 --> 17:20.400
has been dogfooding Unity 8, actually trying it out on his own computer,

17:20.400 --> 17:23.400
and he has been blogging his journey.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.400
And it sounds mostly positive.

17:25.400 --> 17:28.400
He talks about the pros and cons, and I'll leave it to you to read it,

17:28.400 --> 17:30.400
including how to get it all installed if you want to try it

17:30.400 --> 17:33.400
and all of that good stuff and using traditional apps.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.400
But here's what he wrote.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.400
Whenever you have a new desktop environment, which, of course,

17:37.400 --> 17:40.400
Unity 8 effectively is, and the latest UI toolkit, Qt5,

17:40.400 --> 17:42.400
you have to be concerned about performance and resource use.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.400
And given the bleeding nature of Unity 8 on the desktop,

17:45.400 --> 17:49.400
I was expecting to sacrifice some CPU cycles, battery life, and RAM.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.400
The opposite was the case.

17:51.400 --> 17:54.400
I get at least as many hours on my battery as I do with Unity 7,

17:54.400 --> 17:56.400
and I was using less than half the RAM I typically do.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.400
That sounds nice.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.400
It does, doesn't it?

17:58.400 --> 18:02.400
Moreover, things I was expecting to cause me problems surprisingly didn't.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.400
I was able to use Google Hangouts for my video conferences,

18:04.400 --> 18:06.400
which I knew had to be enabled in the browser,

18:06.400 --> 18:09.400
and I fully expected Suspend and Resume to have trouble with Mir,

18:09.400 --> 18:11.400
given the years I spent with X11 in the past,

18:11.400 --> 18:13.400
but it worked nearly flawlessly.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.400
He has some details below.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.400
Here's a couple things that didn't work.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.400
Unity 8 is still very bleeding edge as a desktop shell,

18:17.400 --> 18:20.400
and if you want to use it, you need to be prepared for some pain.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.400
It hasn't been bad enough to stop him yet,

18:22.400 --> 18:25.400
but he has issues like middle click pace doesn't work

18:25.400 --> 18:27.400
when you have highlighted text,

18:27.400 --> 18:29.400
which you kind of realize how much you become dependent on that

18:29.400 --> 18:30.400
once you don't have it.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.400
Yes, you do. Oh, man.

18:31.400 --> 18:34.400
Yeah, you can't copy between Mir and XMir windows yet,

18:34.400 --> 18:36.400
which makes it super not easy.

18:36.400 --> 18:42.400
And Unity 8 itself doesn't super support multiple windows per application,

18:42.400 --> 18:44.400
one app per app, one window per app.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.400
Okay.

18:45.400 --> 18:49.400
But, yeah, otherwise, he's using it.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.400
Unity 8 is being used right now.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.400
Anybody in the Mamba Room trying it?

18:53.400 --> 18:54.400
Come on, somebody.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.400
Nobody?

18:55.400 --> 18:58.400
Oh, come on.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.400
Well, Wes, you know what that means.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.400
You should try it.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.400
I have to try it.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.400
Oh, man. All right.

19:03.400 --> 19:04.400
I'm just kidding.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.400
If there's some good instructions for it, I mean, I'll do it.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.400
All right.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.400
So, here, I'll take over.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.400
Here, let me take over because I want to hear your thoughts

19:10.400 --> 19:12.400
about Fedora 24 here in a moment.

19:12.400 --> 19:15.400
I'll batten down the hatches.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.400
Here, hand me the screwdriver.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.400
And you, sir, pretty much damn near every week,

19:20.400 --> 19:22.400
although this week is an exception,

19:22.400 --> 19:25.400
have been formatting your rig and trying out distros

19:25.400 --> 19:27.400
so you can give us impressions here on this show,

19:27.400 --> 19:31.400
stuff that we might not normally dedicate an entire review segment to,

19:31.400 --> 19:33.400
but ones that we thought, hey, let's just check in on

19:33.400 --> 19:35.400
and see what Wes thinks.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.400
So, Wes, you've been trying out Fedora 24 Beta

19:38.400 --> 19:40.400
or attempting to try out Fedora 24.

19:40.400 --> 19:41.400
Tell me how it's been going.

19:41.400 --> 19:45.400
Well, okay, to be fair, I do format or partition this hard drive a lot.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.400
So, at this point, there's probably, like, three or four operating systems on there,

19:48.400 --> 19:50.400
and it kind of changes all the time.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.400
I don't always have a good index of, like, what's on here or not,

19:53.400 --> 19:56.400
but it's kind of a good test, too, because I'm never, like,

19:56.400 --> 19:58.400
I almost never wipe the entire drive.

19:58.400 --> 20:01.400
I have some kind of document on here I want or a system I was playing with.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.400
So, Fedora did have that stacked against them.

20:03.400 --> 20:07.400
So, they get their own flash drive, boot it into it,

20:07.400 --> 20:10.400
and, you know, go to set it up like normal, click through it at first,

20:10.400 --> 20:13.400
and it looks very nice, and I always appreciate, like, Fedora's boot up.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.400
They have a very nice, usually it's pretty polished.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.400
Consistent.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.400
Gnome is good. They know what they're doing.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.400
Yeah, exactly, and they usually have, like, Plymouth enabled,

20:21.400 --> 20:25.400
and, you know, the entire boot up experience is pleasant.

20:25.400 --> 20:28.400
But once I got into the installer, I just,

20:28.400 --> 20:33.400
the Anaconda, like, partitioning and, you know, file system selection screen,

20:33.400 --> 20:34.400
I just can't.

20:34.400 --> 20:38.400
Laravel says that they've mucked up Anaconda again over on Ferronix.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.400
Yeah, I mean, I don't know what the state it was in before.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.400
It's always changing.

20:43.400 --> 20:47.400
It's never been my favorite installer, but it's just, as Chris saw,

20:47.400 --> 20:51.400
I was trying to just install it, root, you know, everything into one partition,

20:51.400 --> 20:54.400
ext4, simple, install grub on the main drive.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.400
There's only one drive in the machine,

20:56.400 --> 20:59.400
and it's telling me I need to make a boot slash EFI partition,

20:59.400 --> 21:02.400
but it's not EFI. It's not GPT.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.400
It's just MBR BIOS. It's very strange.

21:05.400 --> 21:08.400
So I would really like to play with it more.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.400
Here's a pretty vanilla setup.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.400
The hard drive just fell out of the bottom of it.

21:17.400 --> 21:18.400
Oh, boy.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.400
Well, let's see.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.400
Watch as Chris breaks the Librem here, folks.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.400
No, this is the Apollo.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.400
Oh, the Apollo. Excuse me.

21:24.400 --> 21:29.400
All right. So I put the PCI SSD in that has Antergos in there,

21:29.400 --> 21:33.400
and survey says we're not booting.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.400
So that sucker...

21:36.400 --> 21:37.400
Oh, man.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.400
And it was selected, that one in the BIOS?

21:38.400 --> 21:39.400
I mean, it should be.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.400
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.400
I should probably put the hard drive that fell out back in, but...

21:43.400 --> 21:44.400
Ah.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.400
Yeah.

21:45.400 --> 21:46.400
Oh, man, that's rough.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.400
Yeah, dude.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.400
I wonder why that would just drop dead.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.400
You know, and the thing about Newegg...

21:51.400 --> 21:52.400
There is no why.

21:52.400 --> 21:55.400
...is I have gotten burned several times now by Newegg on returns,

21:55.400 --> 21:57.400
and I don't like to do returns because who has the time?

21:57.400 --> 21:58.400
Right.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.400
Ain't nobody got time for that, Wes.

22:00.400 --> 22:03.400
But we had a machine that we got that was no good,

22:03.400 --> 22:05.400
and it was one of these things where I literally,

22:05.400 --> 22:07.400
I bought it on Newegg because Newegg takes Bitcoin,

22:07.400 --> 22:09.400
and that was like the reason I got it.

22:09.400 --> 22:10.400
I have Bitcoin.

22:10.400 --> 22:11.400
Yes.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.400
And I needed a machine.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.400
And so the machine came in, and like the CPU was dead.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.400
Bad CPU.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.400
Or the motherboard or something.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.400
Of course, it's a completely built machine, so we just send it back,

22:18.400 --> 22:21.400
and they rejected our return for whatever reason.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.400
So I don't know.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.400
So with this, this was bought on Newegg as well.

22:25.400 --> 22:26.400
Classic Newegg.

22:26.400 --> 22:27.400
Yeah, I don't know.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.400
I feel super defeated.

22:29.400 --> 22:32.400
I feel like a bit of a fool for getting into buying parts anymore.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.400
I should just buy computers that have everything soldered on

22:34.400 --> 22:35.400
because apparently that's the only thing that works.

22:35.400 --> 22:36.400
No, no, no.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.400
Just buy from Amazon.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.400
They don't care what you return to them.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.400
Yeah, sure.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.400
No, that's fine.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.400
Get Amazon to take Bitcoin.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.400
You know, Mac OS X, that's Unix, Chris.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.400
That might be a nice MacBook.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.400
You'll have no complaints.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.400
Got your back shell, whatever.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.400
Oh, geez.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.400
So you weren't able to get too far in the Fedora 24 process, huh?

22:54.400 --> 22:55.400
No, not really.

22:55.400 --> 22:56.400
I'm sorry.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.400
I mean, I'll play with it more, and when Fedora 24 comes out,

22:58.400 --> 22:59.400
I'll install it.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.400
Yeah, absolutely.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.400
It's nothing against it.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.400
It's more just like, I don't like how in the Ubuntu installer,

23:03.400 --> 23:07.400
it's really easy to just pick your partition, tell it to format it,

23:07.400 --> 23:09.400
make it root, and go.

23:09.400 --> 23:12.400
And this, it's a little unclear because it kind of lists your other

23:12.400 --> 23:15.400
Linux installations, but it doesn't give you...

23:15.400 --> 23:17.400
Maybe it's better for new users.

23:17.400 --> 23:20.400
I'm not sure, but as someone who understands disk partitioning,

23:20.400 --> 23:23.400
it's frustrating to not have a real representation of what the disk

23:23.400 --> 23:26.400
looks like and be able to understand that or have an accounting of

23:26.400 --> 23:29.400
how much free space is on the disk or, you know, it's like,

23:29.400 --> 23:32.400
you just want gparted and do it and be done with it.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.400
That's probably the way to go then.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.400
Yeah, that's what I'll probably do.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.400
All right, so I'm thinking we should probably swap back to the...

23:38.400 --> 23:39.400
Yeah, pop that back in.

23:39.400 --> 23:40.400
Which is a bummer.

23:40.400 --> 23:43.400
See, this is a 256, and that's a 120.

23:43.400 --> 23:44.400
And that's why I wanted to go to this.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.400
And this is a Samsung 850.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.400
And this is a Kingston.

23:48.400 --> 23:51.400
You'd think this would be the higher quality part, but...

23:51.400 --> 23:52.400
That's a nice drive.

23:52.400 --> 23:53.400
But it's...

23:53.400 --> 23:55.400
Geez.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.400
So anyways, that's just sort of depressing because that means

23:57.400 --> 23:59.400
I have to reload my machine for like a third time.

23:59.400 --> 24:03.400
Should we just put Fedora 24 beta in here while we're doing this?

24:03.400 --> 24:04.400
Yeah, that should be great.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.400
See if it can handle the M2.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.400
Now we've got wallpapers available for Fedora 24.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.400
Extra wallpapers in there.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.400
Actually pretty nice.

24:11.400 --> 24:12.400
Yeah, some of these are pretty nice.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.400
I normally don't mention this kind of stuff because I know you guys are like,

24:14.400 --> 24:15.400
oh, it doesn't really matter.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.400
But I actually think they're pretty cool.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.400
So we'll link to them in the show notes.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.400
I didn't love the default background of the stars,

24:20.400 --> 24:21.400
like the starry thing that they have.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.400
I said it was okay, actually.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.400
I mean, I don't know.

24:23.400 --> 24:24.400
All right, that's just me.

24:24.400 --> 24:25.400
Yeah, you're right.

24:25.400 --> 24:26.400
It's a little underwhelming, I guess,

24:26.400 --> 24:29.400
because that's it right there if you're watching the video version.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.400
It's okay.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.400
I feel like real stars would have been prettier though.

24:32.400 --> 24:33.400
Ooh.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.400
Yeah, that's true.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.400
That's true.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.400
That's true.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.400
So I guess the lesson learned there is just wait.

24:38.400 --> 24:41.400
Although if you're able to get it and try it out.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.400
Yes, I'll see if I can get a good shot next week.

24:43.400 --> 24:46.400
There's a bunch of really kind of interesting spins releasing right now too

24:46.400 --> 24:48.400
on Ubuntu 16.04.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.400
I've been noticing a lot of distros like Easy Linux

24:50.400 --> 24:53.400
and a couple other ones that have come out recently

24:53.400 --> 24:55.400
that are all based on Ubuntu 16.04.

24:55.400 --> 24:58.400
So now is the time when an avalanche of those is landing.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.400
And there's also been a lot of Linux Mint news,

25:00.400 --> 25:03.400
which we're going to get to more Linux Mint stuff here in a bit.

25:03.400 --> 25:04.400
Yes, there has.

25:04.400 --> 25:07.400
But yeah, I'm looking for the name of the...

25:07.400 --> 25:08.400
Oh, yeah.

25:08.400 --> 25:09.400
Okay, here's the other one.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.400
This was the other one.

25:10.400 --> 25:11.400
It's called Urk Linux or something like this.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.400
It was launched.

25:12.400 --> 25:13.400
A Rook?

25:13.400 --> 25:14.400
A Rook, yes.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.400
Did you hear about this?

25:15.400 --> 25:16.400
Yeah, it was based on TriSQL, right?

25:16.400 --> 25:17.400
Yeah, or Trisco.

25:17.400 --> 25:21.400
But now it's based on Ubuntu 16.04.

25:21.400 --> 25:22.400
Oh.

25:22.400 --> 25:23.400
Yeah.

25:23.400 --> 25:26.400
So, yeah.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.400
And so, yeah, there you go.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.400
A real-time follow-up from BC in the chat room

25:29.400 --> 25:31.400
talking about using Bitcoin with Amazon.

25:31.400 --> 25:32.400
Oh, it's back.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.400
Oh, look at that.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.400
Gift had actually...

25:34.400 --> 25:39.400
Gift had been disabled to purchase Amazon gift cards with Bitcoin.

25:39.400 --> 25:40.400
That is a little workaround.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.400
If you have some Bitcoin and you want to buy on Amazon,

25:42.400 --> 25:44.400
you can buy gift cards.

25:44.400 --> 25:45.400
Oh, that's nice.

25:45.400 --> 25:47.400
Yeah, except for at the beginning of May,

25:47.400 --> 25:50.400
they weren't accepting Bitcoin for Amazon, so I couldn't do that.

25:50.400 --> 25:51.400
They had shut down for a while.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.400
It was bad timing.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.400
It was bad timing.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.400
That's why I seriously, like, on last one,

25:55.400 --> 25:57.400
I was pleading with System76 to accept Bitcoin.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.400
I mean it.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.400
I really do mean it.

26:00.400 --> 26:01.400
Just please.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.400
Please, I love this Apollo,

26:02.400 --> 26:05.400
and it's not the Apollo's fault that the Samsung drive died.

26:05.400 --> 26:06.400
No.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.400
You know, it's not, but...

26:07.400 --> 26:10.400
Oh, it's a bit of a setback.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.400
I still...

26:11.400 --> 26:12.400
It's my condolences, Chris.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.400
It's not like I spilled beer all over it or anything.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.400
At least you have a backup.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.400
Yeah, that's true.

26:17.400 --> 26:18.400
That's true.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.400
And it could have been worse.

26:19.400 --> 26:20.400
It could have gotten beer spilled all over it.

26:20.400 --> 26:22.400
Speaking of which, how are you enjoying the beer?

26:22.400 --> 26:23.400
It's good.

26:23.400 --> 26:24.400
Yeah.

26:24.400 --> 26:25.400
It's quite hoppy.

26:25.400 --> 26:26.400
Yeah, it is.

26:26.400 --> 26:27.400
It is, really.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.400
I'm about halfway done with mine.

26:28.400 --> 26:31.400
Not my favorite IPA, but it's enjoyable.

26:31.400 --> 26:34.400
So I guess we're already done with the...

26:34.400 --> 26:35.400
Hold on, let me bring it back.

26:35.400 --> 26:37.400
We're already done with the Apollo sickbay.

26:37.400 --> 26:40.400
We've figured out that it is indeed the drive,

26:40.400 --> 26:41.400
and that problem solved,

26:41.400 --> 26:44.400
and I can either just use Ubuntu again or reload that with Arch.

26:44.400 --> 26:45.400
Wipe it and reload.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.400
I expected that to take us the entire episode.

26:47.400 --> 26:48.400
Good job, Wes.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.400
We're an efficient pair.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.400
It's because Noah's not here, I think.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.400
Hello, everybody.

26:54.400 --> 26:55.400
There you go.

26:55.400 --> 26:56.400
That's a good one.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.400
I like that.

26:57.400 --> 26:58.400
Okay.

26:58.400 --> 27:00.400
So we have to talk about Mint.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.400
Everyone else is.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.400
Right.

27:03.400 --> 27:08.400
When I said earlier in the show that I was getting kind of grumpy and cranky,

27:08.400 --> 27:11.400
I actually think it's because of the stuff I was talking about with Mint

27:11.400 --> 27:13.400
on the Linux action show.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.400
And I do want to make a correction to my coverage.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.400
So really briefly, for those of you who didn't see last week's episode,

27:17.400 --> 27:21.400
because I'm sure that's plenty of you,

27:21.400 --> 27:26.400
I sort of took the position and argument that Mint is entering into an era

27:26.400 --> 27:30.400
of unprecedented technical debt for a project their size

27:30.400 --> 27:34.400
with their continuation of MATE based on GTK2,

27:34.400 --> 27:40.400
with their forking of many standard desktop apps to XApps,

27:40.400 --> 27:47.400
with their themes with Cinnamon and the MATE project in general,

27:47.400 --> 27:50.400
I kind of was trying to build the case that there's a technical debt

27:50.400 --> 27:51.400
that they're entering here.

27:51.400 --> 27:55.400
Now, I did make the inaccurate statement that the XApps were based on GTK2.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.400
That is not true.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.400
They're based on GTK3.

27:58.400 --> 27:59.400
Right.

27:59.400 --> 28:00.400
That's kind of part of the point of them.

28:00.400 --> 28:01.400
Right.

28:01.400 --> 28:02.400
Yeah.

28:02.400 --> 28:05.400
And I think that's mostly because I just don't really care about that point

28:05.400 --> 28:06.400
because that's not really my point.

28:06.400 --> 28:07.400
That's not your problem with it.

28:07.400 --> 28:08.400
Yeah, exactly.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.400
These apps are being forged.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.400
I should be accurate when I'm talking about it.

28:11.400 --> 28:14.400
So I apologize for that mistake.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.400
So I kind of wanted to get your thoughts on it.

28:17.400 --> 28:20.400
I know you've been a – are you running Mint right there on that laptop now?

28:20.400 --> 28:21.400
It's one of the partitions.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.400
Yeah.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.400
And you're running Mint right there on the Bonobo.

28:23.400 --> 28:24.400
Yes.

28:24.400 --> 28:28.400
And I just want to give the virtual log a chance to talk about this issue in general.

28:28.400 --> 28:33.400
And maybe we could talk wider too about the – well,

28:33.400 --> 28:36.400
one of the things that offends me about this entire Mint situation,

28:36.400 --> 28:37.400
and I think the biggest part is the XApps.

28:37.400 --> 28:40.400
I feel like that was the line that was too far.

28:40.400 --> 28:41.400
And I don't know why.

28:41.400 --> 28:46.400
I just feel like that was sort of the line that felt like there was a bit of curmudgeon stick in the mud.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.400
We can do this better than other people.

28:48.400 --> 28:54.400
And then it was all sold to us in a these will be for all distributions rallying cry,

28:54.400 --> 28:58.400
which is so often the rallying cry of the random forker.

28:58.400 --> 29:02.400
Oh, this is for all when in reality it's for your own project.

29:02.400 --> 29:07.400
And so the arrogance of it sort of smacked me in the face.

29:07.400 --> 29:12.400
And so that was sort of a line that they crossed as a project with me that made me sort of reevaluate

29:12.400 --> 29:18.400
sort of the long-term realistic viability I think they have as a project.

29:18.400 --> 29:23.400
And so I tried to sort of talk about that on Sunday's show,

29:23.400 --> 29:28.400
but it was in the context of covering the news, and it just wasn't really the best place to do it.

29:28.400 --> 29:33.400
So I and I and I want to see if maybe you guys think I got something wrong and maybe I should walk it back a bit.

29:33.400 --> 29:38.400
So we're going to talk about that just for a moment in the show.

29:38.400 --> 29:42.400
Because in the in the show notes, I put it as.

29:42.400 --> 29:45.400
Is meant too big to fail.

29:45.400 --> 29:50.400
Sort of, you know, obviously tongue in cheek play on the banks, but like when you have it,

29:50.400 --> 29:56.400
when you have a distribution, I just I just read this the stupid blog post from one of these random text sites

29:56.400 --> 30:01.400
that gets some traffic. Top 10 Linux distributions of 2016.

30:01.400 --> 30:07.400
OK. Yep. One of those. Yeah. Number one distro Linux Mint number one distro.

30:07.400 --> 30:12.400
And they're always like this distro watch top of the list Linux Mint.

30:12.400 --> 30:21.400
There is a position of public perception that Linux Mint enjoys that only Ubuntu rivals.

30:21.400 --> 30:30.400
And likely surpasses. And so the idea that Linux Mint could collapse.

30:30.400 --> 30:33.400
Probably a lot of it seems, oh, that's impossible. That's impossible.

30:33.400 --> 30:37.400
There is a staple in the community. But is it more like because if they did collapse,

30:37.400 --> 30:42.400
we would look like such a such a bunch of clown shoes as a community that we can't even fathom it?

30:42.400 --> 30:46.400
Because it seems like that's where we're headed. So maybe I'm getting worked up here.

30:46.400 --> 30:50.400
But I want to talk about that with you guys and why I think it's a huge deal more

30:50.400 --> 30:53.400
and maybe better state my case. So I'm going to start by mentioning Ting.

30:53.400 --> 30:58.400
Let's start right here by mentioning Ting. Everybody right now. Linux.ting.com.

30:58.400 --> 31:02.400
Let's all go there like a group mind. We don't need the Borg to act as one group mind.

31:02.400 --> 31:05.400
Linux.ting.com. You go there, you get a discount, you support this show.

31:05.400 --> 31:09.400
If you got a phone, Ting is going to give you a credit. If you don't have a phone

31:09.400 --> 31:12.400
and you might have a phone that works, you should check it out because they got CDMA and GSM.

31:12.400 --> 31:15.400
But if you don't have a phone, they give you twenty five dollars to buy something nice.

31:15.400 --> 31:19.400
They got a bunch of great unlocked phones you can get directly or you can go get really.

31:19.400 --> 31:23.400
I mean there's all these great phones at Ting. Everything from the budget like

31:23.400 --> 31:27.400
you can just get the SIM card or like a feature phone for sixty bucks or all the way up to the Cadillacs.

31:27.400 --> 31:31.400
You know the S7s and the internet phone 6s and the 6Ps and whatnot.

31:31.400 --> 31:37.400
But I really am a huge fan of the 5x if you can afford it.

31:37.400 --> 31:42.400
I think it's a great budget phone. You can get it from Ting or Google Play

31:42.400 --> 31:47.400
and you can just bring it over right now. It's you know perfect in that sense on Ting

31:47.400 --> 31:51.400
because you have an unlocked device getting Google updates directly on a pay for what you use

31:51.400 --> 31:57.400
mobile service provider and the 5x supports GSM or CDMA.

31:57.400 --> 32:00.400
It's the perfect situation. You can pop in the SIM and activate on their website.

32:00.400 --> 32:03.400
Never talk to human being if you want although they have great customer service.

32:03.400 --> 32:08.400
You pay for what you use on all their devices. Unlimited devices just six dollars a month for the line

32:08.400 --> 32:12.400
and then whatever you got to pay Uncle Sam and then you just pay for your usage.

32:12.400 --> 32:17.400
It's brilliant. You want a hotspot or tethering? Turn it on.

32:17.400 --> 32:23.400
Before I had Ting I had to call my mobile service provider and say I would like to get a hotspot.

32:23.400 --> 32:28.400
I would like to be able to use the hotspot checkbox that's built into my operating system.

32:28.400 --> 32:34.400
Oh okay well Mr. Fisher you need to sign up for our family share plan or well we can give you an extra two gigs a month.

32:34.400 --> 32:38.400
It was redonkulous. I hated it. Not with Ting.

32:38.400 --> 32:43.400
Plus they have great tools to give you total control over your account on your phone or through any device through the web.

32:43.400 --> 32:46.400
People love Ting and Ting is great. Go check them out.

32:46.400 --> 32:51.400
From SIM cards starting at nine dollars. The Ansotel One Touch Fling sixty three dollars.

32:51.400 --> 32:54.400
Now you can get into a LG Volt 2 for sixty six bucks. What?

32:54.400 --> 33:01.400
Linux.ting.com go there and try them out. The Ansotel One Touch Idol 3 is also a great phone for under two hundred dollars.

33:01.400 --> 33:09.400
The original OG Nexus 5. Again a Google experience phone. Unlocked. CDMA or GSM.

33:09.400 --> 33:12.400
Right on the Ting network for under two hundred bucks.

33:12.400 --> 33:16.400
You know what we forgot to mention about this? All these phones? They're running Linux.

33:16.400 --> 33:20.400
That is cool huh? That is really something. Except for that internet phone right there.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.400
Right right.

33:21.400 --> 33:25.400
They're running that thing that Alan likes though so you got to give them something I suppose.

33:25.400 --> 33:32.400
Tomato. Tomato. The Note 5 is. Boy you know if I was in the market right now and I was.

33:32.400 --> 33:37.400
That Note 5 has such a killer camera and they just added the S7.

33:37.400 --> 33:40.400
You can get these phones also on your own and then bring them over to Ting as well.

33:40.400 --> 33:41.400
That's one of the best parts about Ting.

33:41.400 --> 33:47.400
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the show and thanks to you guys who listen and go there.

33:47.400 --> 33:51.400
Because you taking that couple of minutes out of your day keeps the show on the air.

33:51.400 --> 33:54.400
Linux.ting.com go learn more about them.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.400
So let's start with the positive stuff.

33:55.400 --> 33:59.400
There is I think a pretty nice look coming to Linux Mint 18.

33:59.400 --> 34:03.400
This is their new flatter Mint Y theme.

34:03.400 --> 34:07.400
So Mint X will be the default theme in Sara. That's the next release.

34:07.400 --> 34:11.400
And Mint Y is going to be this new Arc Boca based theme thing.

34:11.400 --> 34:15.400
And I think it looks pretty sharp. I think it looks good. I'll give credit where credit is due.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.400
I think they're doing a good job. I like the way they're rolling this out.

34:17.400 --> 34:21.400
I like all of it. I do. I like all of it.

34:21.400 --> 34:27.400
I want to read you though a little verbiage in the introduction of the new theme.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.400
And maybe I'm parsing words but you know words matter.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.400
Because I think they reflect quite a bit.

34:32.400 --> 34:38.400
So when Clem was writing about this new theme.

34:38.400 --> 34:41.400
We talked about a new theme and we noticed.

34:41.400 --> 34:43.400
This is Clem.

34:43.400 --> 34:49.400
Some of you were also scared of the changes this would introduce.

34:49.400 --> 34:53.400
And I think the words using the word scared right there is particularly interesting.

34:53.400 --> 34:59.400
I think it reveals a little bit into how he perceives his user base.

34:59.400 --> 35:02.400
We don't want to change styles just because we think it might look better.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.400
We'll provide both styles to you which I think that's a great way to go.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.400
Eventually if the day comes where a huge majority prefer the new theme.

35:07.400 --> 35:10.400
Then we'll follow that and start using it as a new default.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.400
Also I really like the way he says that.

35:12.400 --> 35:15.400
So I'm you know I just want to hear scared though.

35:15.400 --> 35:19.400
I don't know if that almost sounds demeaning a little bit.

35:19.400 --> 35:22.400
And so it goes as we continue on.

35:22.400 --> 35:28.400
Linux Mint 18 will also drop multimedia support.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.400
No more codecs installations.

35:30.400 --> 35:37.400
And it sounds like mostly because OEMs and magazines wanted the no codecs CD.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.400
And because making two sets of CDs.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.400
Which is multiples there's multiple skews of those.

35:42.400 --> 35:46.400
Was a lot of work instead of just not having a no codecs version.

35:46.400 --> 35:47.400
They're going to have an.

35:47.400 --> 35:48.400
That's the only version.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.400
That's the only version.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.400
Yeah.

35:51.400 --> 35:56.400
Which leads me to my next and final question before I toss it to you in the mobile room.

35:56.400 --> 35:59.400
What the hell is the point of Linux Mint now.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.400
That's a good question.

36:00.400 --> 36:02.400
Because you know when I trolled around on the Internet.

36:02.400 --> 36:06.400
And I found a few people that had answers.

36:06.400 --> 36:08.400
Before before some of these decisions.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.400
One answer was well I dislike unity.

36:10.400 --> 36:13.400
And I just want something that's not unity by default really quick.

36:13.400 --> 36:17.400
And this is well before a lot of Ubuntu flavors were established.

36:17.400 --> 36:18.400
Another common answer.

36:18.400 --> 36:21.400
Easy ability to play DVDs.

36:21.400 --> 36:22.400
Very relevant.

36:22.400 --> 36:26.400
Yeah not super relevant anymore and not hard to fix under Ubuntu anymore.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.400
And then this is another common one.

36:28.400 --> 36:32.400
Wanting to give Shuttleworth the middle finger for cramming unity down my throat.

36:32.400 --> 36:35.400
But that middle finger has been extended for long enough.

36:35.400 --> 36:37.400
And I actually think that last one.

36:37.400 --> 36:39.400
Is very telling.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.400
People were pissed about Ubuntu.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.400
People were pissed about unity.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.400
They were.

36:43.400 --> 36:44.400
They were pissed about.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.400
I was one of the ones that kind of fled from Ubuntu.

36:45.400 --> 36:46.400
And you know what.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.400
That rage has started to fade.

36:48.400 --> 36:52.400
And so there and now that is no longer a reason to use Mint.

36:52.400 --> 36:58.400
And now Ubuntu Mate has taken many reasons away from using Mint.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.400
And now last but not least.

36:59.400 --> 37:03.400
Removing the codex seems like it takes yet another set of reasons.

37:03.400 --> 37:04.400
So what's left.

37:04.400 --> 37:06.400
Is it an old implementation of Mate.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.400
Is it their one off cinnamon island.

37:08.400 --> 37:11.400
Is it them not installing security updates.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.400
Is it improper web administration.

37:13.400 --> 37:16.400
What is the big feature left for using Mint.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.400
And you use Mint so you tell me Wes.

37:18.400 --> 37:22.400
You know I think I do have Mint installed.

37:22.400 --> 37:25.400
But I don't see myself installing any new Mint.

37:25.400 --> 37:28.400
I think that it really was like them removing the codex.

37:28.400 --> 37:32.400
It doesn't like that actual loss of value isn't that much these days.

37:32.400 --> 37:36.400
But I feel like it's very telling and like it reminds me of why I came to Mint.

37:36.400 --> 37:38.400
Or like why when it was first popular.

37:38.400 --> 37:41.400
I was an Ubuntu user I had friends using Mint and that was like a huge reason for them.

37:41.400 --> 37:45.400
It was just it was Ubuntu but you know maybe they like the interface better.

37:45.400 --> 37:49.400
And it looked a little better and it wasn't so you know Ubuntu.

37:49.400 --> 37:53.400
And now you know there's lots of times where it's like oh Gnome was changing.

37:53.400 --> 37:58.400
And Cinnamon or before you know Linux Mint was a very stable place.

37:58.400 --> 37:59.400
It just worked.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.400
You had the stuff you need.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.400
You could install it anywhere you knew you had VLC.

38:02.400 --> 38:03.400
You could just play whatever you wanted.

38:03.400 --> 38:04.400
It was really easy.

38:04.400 --> 38:09.400
But these days Ubuntu isn't hard and there's so many options.

38:09.400 --> 38:13.400
There is Ubuntu MATE and Linux Mint kind of lags behind as well.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.400
Like there's all this excitement right now about 16.04.

38:15.400 --> 38:18.400
And like you can get 16.04 MATE right now and have a great experience.

38:18.400 --> 38:20.400
But where's Linux Mint 18?

38:20.400 --> 38:22.400
We're waiting for that.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.400
Yeah and why are we waiting?

38:23.400 --> 38:24.400
Why are we waiting for that?

38:24.400 --> 38:27.400
Because it's not like they were pumping out a bunch of intermediary releases.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.400
And I also feel like you're right that they are taking on a lot.

38:29.400 --> 38:32.400
And it's not like clearly they do some things well and I like Cinnamon.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.400
And there are parts about it that I will always think that's good.

38:34.400 --> 38:35.400
I would argue that this is why we're waiting.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.400
But this is why we're waiting.

38:36.400 --> 38:40.400
And it's also I don't know that like some of the things they're doing is not necessarily what they should be doing.

38:40.400 --> 38:47.400
And I worry that one of the things I always liked about Linux Mint and what you liked about when we reviewed 17.3 is like the attention to the detail.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.400
The nice like oh the integration with the music.

38:49.400 --> 38:54.400
Those are things where like they really do I think understand a certain subset of Linux users and what they want.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.400
I think they know that.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.400
Yeah they'll sound like elementary OS users.

38:57.400 --> 38:58.400
Right.

38:58.400 --> 39:02.400
And if they don't focus on that like the other parts like I don't know if like yeah.

39:02.400 --> 39:15.400
And at the same time it's like well I don't know if I want them making these universal apps when there are also other people making individual apps that maybe have more design experience or app experience or just more experience in general.

39:15.400 --> 39:16.400
Yeah well put Wes.

39:16.400 --> 39:19.400
Anybody in the Mumble Room want to jump in with their thoughts on the state of Mint?

39:19.400 --> 39:20.400
Anybody have a counter take?

39:20.400 --> 39:21.400
You're welcome to jump in too.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.400
I'd love to hear that argument.

39:23.400 --> 39:31.400
Because to me it's seeming like it's becoming case closed and I hate to think that way because you know Clem and team have worked very hard on this for a long time.

39:31.400 --> 39:34.400
I know Ladies Night 62 in there had some similar thoughts.

39:34.400 --> 39:37.400
Did you want to jump in?

39:37.400 --> 39:39.400
Mr. Night?

39:39.400 --> 39:40.400
No.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.400
Hmm.

39:41.400 --> 39:42.400
All right.

39:42.400 --> 39:43.400
Well Poppy I noticed you joined in.

39:43.400 --> 39:44.400
I wonder if you wanted to show.

39:44.400 --> 39:51.400
In the past you and I have chatted about sort of Mint as an overall contributor and citizen to the open source community.

39:51.400 --> 40:00.400
Do you feel like their stance there has begun to catch up with them?

40:00.400 --> 40:01.400
Oh sorry.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.400
There you go.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.400
Sorry Poppy I had you muted like a jerk.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.400
I'm sorry.

40:04.400 --> 40:07.400
That's fine.

40:07.400 --> 40:08.400
Jerk.

40:08.400 --> 40:09.400
I don't know.

40:09.400 --> 40:14.400
I kind of think the whole codec thing is overblown.

40:14.400 --> 40:21.400
I think maybe eight years ago that was a thing like you know I need my DivX codecs.

40:21.400 --> 40:22.400
I need my codec pack.

40:22.400 --> 40:33.400
Like the people who ran Windows whatever back then would go hunting down the best codec pack and oh no you get the green screen on your video playback or you get vertical lines or whatever.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.400
Oh you need the latest codecs.

40:35.400 --> 40:36.400
This is 2016 people.

40:36.400 --> 40:39.400
You don't need a shonky codec.

40:39.400 --> 40:41.400
I used to pay for mine from Fluendo.

40:41.400 --> 40:42.400
Remember that?

40:42.400 --> 40:43.400
Oh wow right.

40:43.400 --> 40:44.400
It's a lunacy.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.400
It's 2016 right.

40:45.400 --> 40:53.400
Codec things are not an issue now unless you get your shonky video from like off the back of a lorry or something but that's not an issue.

40:53.400 --> 41:01.400
So I actually don't think it's a big problem that they're stopping distributing a version of the ISO that has the codecs bundled in.

41:01.400 --> 41:05.400
I think that's the right thing to do because I don't think legally they probably.

41:05.400 --> 41:06.400
Yeah I agree.

41:06.400 --> 41:11.400
I don't think they had the permission to do that in the first place and I think this makes them a better upstanding citizen for doing that.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.400
So I think that's actually the right thing to do.

41:13.400 --> 41:16.400
But I don't see how that's a problem.

41:16.400 --> 41:19.400
I don't think that's a rock that we need to throw at them.

41:19.400 --> 41:32.400
I think there are other things that I would worry about with Mint but they have a very wide and diverse user base and they have a lot of people contributing monetarily to the product.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.400
I know we have a lot of fans in the audience.

41:34.400 --> 41:45.400
No I think the reason why the codec things come up is because it's sort of like the temperature in the boiling water just got turned up a lot.

41:45.400 --> 41:49.400
And people are like wait a minute where does Mint fit in now exactly?

41:49.400 --> 41:51.400
For a lot of people it was oh this is how I get my codecs.

41:51.400 --> 42:01.400
And as each one of these different categories gets filled in by either another distro or by their decisions I think more and more people kind of wake up and go well now wait a minute.

42:01.400 --> 42:06.400
And I guess I turn my question back to you.

42:06.400 --> 42:20.400
If it's not their security practices and sort of forking their own applications and things like that what is it in your estimation that I guess put very frankly Popey prevents you from installing Mint.

42:20.400 --> 42:22.400
Why don't you run Linux Mint?

42:22.400 --> 42:26.400
Because I'm one of those perverse people who actually like Unity.

42:26.400 --> 42:27.400
All right.

42:27.400 --> 42:29.400
I don't believe you.

42:29.400 --> 42:33.400
Actually there's a surprising number of us out there you know.

42:33.400 --> 42:39.400
And despite what everyone might say and sticking the finger to Mark well done.

42:39.400 --> 42:50.400
But actually there's still a whole load of us who quite like using this thing and it hasn't moved a lot in years and it's you know you could argue it's stale and it needs a refresh here and there and fair enough.

42:50.400 --> 42:52.400
I accept all those arguments.

42:52.400 --> 43:03.400
But I guess it's not a component of sour grapes is it I mean it's not competitive that he was able to take that product and then branch off a whole bunch of separate users that found it to be a superior product.

43:03.400 --> 43:15.400
Personally no I think I think it's fantastic that someone could take the Ubuntu base and create a derivative distribution that has a huge number of users.

43:15.400 --> 43:23.400
I'm not happy about certain things like the you know the security model that they have I've never been a big fan of holding back updates from users.

43:23.400 --> 43:29.400
But that's their choice that they've chosen for their user base and their user base seem to be accepting of that.

43:29.400 --> 43:42.400
Many of the users technically inclined users will defend the position that Clem has taken with the way Linux Mint distributes their updates and makes their system defaults and that's fine.

43:42.400 --> 43:44.400
And they have a wide and diverse user base.

43:44.400 --> 43:49.400
They've got lots of people who give their hard earned cash voluntarily.

43:49.400 --> 43:56.400
You know it's not a subscription service they voluntarily give their money to Linux Mint to say thank you to Clem for creating what he's done.

43:56.400 --> 44:02.400
So he must have done something right for all these people to be using it and for people to give him the money.

44:02.400 --> 44:14.400
Technically minded folks technically minded folks Popey says so Wimpy as a technically minded folk are you are you looking at the X apps as a possibility.

44:14.400 --> 44:20.400
I don't know people people may not realize Wimpy has a Mate based desktop distribution that he is familiar with.

44:20.400 --> 44:28.400
And I'm just curious as somebody who's familiar with the Mate based desktop are the X apps appealing to you in any way.

44:28.400 --> 44:41.400
Most of the X apps are stripped down versions of the Marte desktop application with the desktop integration removed and built against GTK three.

44:41.400 --> 44:46.400
So right. So Puma has been recalled as Zed or X ed.

44:46.400 --> 44:53.400
I have known is now called X viewer X reader is a truly totem is called X player etc etc.

44:53.400 --> 44:54.400
These are the X apps.

44:54.400 --> 44:58.400
Yeah. And yeah and some of those that you've mentioned are the desktop apps.

44:58.400 --> 45:13.400
And so Marte has its suite of tools and applications and then we found other utilities to fill the gaps for you know media playback and stuff.

45:13.400 --> 45:17.400
So now I'm not going to be using the X apps.

45:17.400 --> 45:25.400
So what what what is the what what what is the niche they're following filling. Can you help just in your opinion give me an understanding of that.

45:25.400 --> 45:29.400
Why do I need X player over totem or VLC.

45:29.400 --> 45:35.400
What's the if I'm if I'm if I'm using these if I'm using these X apps I must need this over.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.400
So what is it that it's doing exactly.

45:37.400 --> 45:38.400
What's it enabling.

45:38.400 --> 45:47.400
I think this is more a development focused decision rather than an end user focused decision by forking these applications.

45:47.400 --> 46:03.400
You can choose what toolkit version to target when you build them and then you have a degree of predictability about how they're going to behave against the targeted toolkit over their two year period.

46:03.400 --> 46:16.400
So that way that just sounds like you're planning for obsolescence you're planning to use old code you're planning to be stale or planning to be predictable.

46:16.400 --> 46:33.400
You know it's Clem's decision and I think it's a development decision to streamline the development process as much as possible so there aren't going to be any unexpected changes throughout the course of that version's lifecycle.

46:33.400 --> 46:37.400
You know people have also said the same thing about the way security updates are handled.

46:37.400 --> 46:48.400
Is it it's for the users it's for the end users is it or is it so that way there's not a whole bunch of support issues somewhere in the in between probably.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.400
It's probably not.

46:49.400 --> 46:56.400
I've never been a fan of the update model in Linux Mint.

46:56.400 --> 47:16.400
So yeah I think I think it's more about not not introducing change that might introduce support issues and if you read back through some of the Mint release notes the words sort of reinforce that mindset that you know if it if it's not broken don't update it.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.400
Yeah.

47:18.400 --> 47:23.400
I suppose I suppose like Aiki says is Aiki in the is he in the model room?

47:23.400 --> 47:27.400
He should be because like he just said it reminds him of what Cinnamon is in general.

47:27.400 --> 47:31.400
I suppose that's a good point.

47:31.400 --> 47:34.400
So West Jeff too asked in the chat room.

47:34.400 --> 47:39.400
He says are the X apps just applicable to Mint Mate.

47:39.400 --> 47:42.400
Essentially that's the only place they're going to get used.

47:42.400 --> 47:44.400
That's so functionally.

47:44.400 --> 47:46.400
They're intended to be everywhere.

47:46.400 --> 47:53.400
Yeah they're going to the Cinnamon version and the Xubuntu version as well I think maybe not the KDE version.

47:53.400 --> 47:56.400
I mean I don't follow those particularly closely.

47:56.400 --> 47:58.400
But why would why would any other project use these.

47:58.400 --> 48:01.400
I guess that's what I'm not what am I not understanding about this.

48:01.400 --> 48:05.400
It seems like it seems like these would have very very minimal appeal.

48:05.400 --> 48:07.400
I could see Xubuntu using them for a release cycle.

48:07.400 --> 48:08.400
I guess that makes sense.

48:08.400 --> 48:11.400
Yeah that's true.

48:11.400 --> 48:17.400
But I wouldn't want to still using X of C's which is still GTK2 so they might have a benefit.

48:17.400 --> 48:21.400
But in general right.

48:21.400 --> 48:31.400
I guess what I what I here's where this this sounds like we are we are introducing in a very minute level of fragmentation everywhere.

48:31.400 --> 48:41.400
When we have Puma and we have Zed and we have G edit and we have Kate and we have K right and we have Nano and we have Vim and we have Emacs and we have.

48:41.400 --> 48:43.400
I mean the list goes on and on.

48:43.400 --> 48:44.400
We have.

48:44.400 --> 48:45.400
You're making me dizzy over here.

48:45.400 --> 48:46.400
So so it's.

48:46.400 --> 48:47.400
You forgot the Electron stuff too.

48:47.400 --> 48:48.400
Which drives me.

48:48.400 --> 49:00.400
What drives me crazy right now is I could install Ubuntu Mate and I could get one text editor and then I install Linux Mint Mate and I get an entirely different text editor even though I'm choosing the Mate desktop.

49:00.400 --> 49:03.400
And as an end user how the hell am I supposed to keep that straight.

49:03.400 --> 49:05.400
Oh sure maybe we can keep it straight.

49:05.400 --> 49:13.400
I mean maybe maybe or maybe I will forget it after this episode and I can't I won't be able to remember which distribution has what.

49:13.400 --> 49:16.400
I just find it to be what I find it to be is typical.

49:16.400 --> 49:19.400
I find it to be disappointing and typical of the Linux community.

49:19.400 --> 49:24.400
This is the typical crap that we do that makes it completely confusing to new users to come to Linux.

49:24.400 --> 49:30.400
And you have to be like Leo Laporte and spend three months and have 22 flash drives to try out different distributions or you have to be like.

49:30.400 --> 49:31.400
Find the one that works.

49:31.400 --> 49:37.400
Or you have to be like Chase Nunes and have an entire show built around you deciding which distribution to use because there's so much damn choice.

49:37.400 --> 49:40.400
And then we say when we pat ourselves on the back and we say good job everybody.

49:40.400 --> 49:42.400
Now we've got choice.

49:42.400 --> 49:43.400
Good job.

49:43.400 --> 49:44.400
Well good job everybody.

49:44.400 --> 49:46.400
This is a good one.

49:46.400 --> 49:49.400
And it's it's ridiculous that we have our text editors.

49:49.400 --> 49:52.400
It's our text editors that are this fragmented now.

49:52.400 --> 49:54.400
It's like all this stuff.

49:54.400 --> 49:56.400
How many file managers do we need.

49:56.400 --> 49:59.400
I know this is an old horse that I don't need to keep kicking so I'll move on.

49:59.400 --> 50:02.400
But it's just as frustrating sometimes.

50:02.400 --> 50:03.400
I guess I saw.

50:03.400 --> 50:10.400
Here's why I guess I'm kind of upset about it is I guess I sort of saw a point with with butter F.S.

50:10.400 --> 50:26.400
and containers and GTK three and system D and everybody now being on a modern Linux for kernel so much of the Linux landscape sort of began to coalesce in a way that have a standard Linux.

50:26.400 --> 50:38.400
Well not even a standard but a platform that is reasonable and rational to target with that was beginning to emerge a rational target for a developer a rational target for somebody to build a product around.

50:38.400 --> 50:49.400
Something that didn't need something like Android that was something that was your as a product manager you're able to wrap your head around something that just look nice and simple and uneasy to understand.

50:49.400 --> 50:56.400
And here we are now midway on not even midway into 2016 and it's a total clown show.

50:56.400 --> 50:57.400
All right.

50:57.400 --> 51:00.400
And of Rand I'm just going to disagree.

51:00.400 --> 51:03.400
I don't think this is an example of the clown show.

51:03.400 --> 51:09.400
I mean yeah with the is it's an excessive amount of applications that really don't need to exist.

51:09.400 --> 51:13.400
And I don't think anybody has a reason why men would do that.

51:13.400 --> 51:18.400
But that's just an example of a bad decision by one distro.

51:18.400 --> 51:31.400
So like if someone builds an app image or the snap a snap package or whatever it can be spread across a lot of places like app images everywhere you can run that anywhere you want to.

51:31.400 --> 51:34.400
But like even snappy is only better.

51:34.400 --> 51:40.400
It's not even been around a month yet and you can run it on every pretty much every official flavor of a bunty you want to.

51:40.400 --> 51:49.400
That'll probably be the best way to install applications on mint 18 because it's going to be the best thing about mint 18 is it'll be based on 1604.

51:49.400 --> 51:50.400
Yeah.

51:50.400 --> 51:56.400
And I think they'll probably they'll probably iron out some of the rough edges that know what was going on about again this week on.

51:56.400 --> 51:59.400
Pretty soon we're just not going to have anything to complain about.

51:59.400 --> 52:00.400
Good.

52:00.400 --> 52:01.400
I don't like you.

52:01.400 --> 52:02.400
People don't like it when I get grumpy.

52:02.400 --> 52:03.400
They don't like it.

52:03.400 --> 52:04.400
I don't like it.

52:04.400 --> 52:05.400
You have to defend yourself.

52:05.400 --> 52:06.400
It's a whole thing.

52:06.400 --> 52:09.400
Well and this mint stuff and this mint stuff in particular has me particularly grumpy.

52:09.400 --> 52:10.400
So it's OK.

52:10.400 --> 52:11.400
It's all right.

52:11.400 --> 52:12.400
I'll be all right.

52:12.400 --> 52:15.400
But there's an interesting benefit of the new 1604 releases.

52:15.400 --> 52:22.400
You know how the the issue of the Nome software fork not working with local devs.

52:22.400 --> 52:30.400
It actually brought to light that the new version of apt has a built in local dev install.

52:30.400 --> 52:37.400
So you just do pseudo apt install and then put the path to the dev and it just installs it and handles.

52:37.400 --> 52:39.400
That is nice to know.

52:39.400 --> 52:40.400
Good tip.

52:40.400 --> 52:41.400
Good tip.

52:41.400 --> 52:42.400
Anybody else have thoughts on mint.

52:42.400 --> 52:51.400
Anybody want to take a counter because I know we have a lot of mint fans and I I say all these things and then I install mint and I do kind of get it like that machine right there is running it.

52:51.400 --> 52:54.400
It's been running mint since we reviewed it in last.

52:54.400 --> 52:55.400
I stay true to my word.

52:55.400 --> 53:00.400
I've been running production now for months and it's a rock solid rig.

53:00.400 --> 53:01.400
Really. Yeah.

53:01.400 --> 53:03.400
I mean but I don't do anything with it.

53:03.400 --> 53:06.400
I just run you know mumble and web browsers and that's it.

53:06.400 --> 53:10.400
But that's pretty much my situation as well.

53:10.400 --> 53:14.400
So I when I when I use mint I do kind of grok where he's going with it Clem.

53:14.400 --> 53:15.400
I do kind of grok where he's going with it.

53:15.400 --> 53:20.400
And I but then when I look at it from a broader ecosystem perspective I get real frustrated.

53:20.400 --> 53:29.400
And I the reason why I particularly have a lot of momentum behind this frustration is I really feel like they're an important important position.

53:29.400 --> 53:31.400
Like I got these I got these.

53:31.400 --> 53:35.400
They have a lot of goodwill and you know the residents in the Linux community especially for newcomers.

53:35.400 --> 53:36.400
And a lot of attention.

53:36.400 --> 53:37.400
Yeah.

53:37.400 --> 53:42.400
And I mean I just I feel like we got a little taste of it when that security thing went down.

53:42.400 --> 53:45.400
When that security thing went down we got a little taste of it Wes.

53:45.400 --> 53:46.400
And I just don't.

53:46.400 --> 53:48.400
Dude they're still number one on distro watch.

53:48.400 --> 53:53.400
Yes of course of course they have been for a long time haven't they.

53:53.400 --> 54:00.400
It's kind of weird how they're out there number one when every version of mint is actually included all in the same result.

54:00.400 --> 54:04.400
And at the same time they don't even have their own user agents that they press.

54:04.400 --> 54:09.400
So like how does how does distro watch actually get that information.

54:09.400 --> 54:11.400
I've actually asked them and they won't tell me.

54:11.400 --> 54:14.400
Like that's that's you know proprietary information.

54:14.400 --> 54:23.400
Well it's based on it's the the the the charts are generated on interest on the distro watch site.

54:23.400 --> 54:29.400
So the people that are visiting the district they're not saying is it just the actual page or is it a user agent.

54:29.400 --> 54:31.400
But it can't really be a user agent.

54:31.400 --> 54:32.400
So like how are they getting it.

54:32.400 --> 54:37.400
And they said they have like multiple factors that use but they won't tell me what that was.

54:37.400 --> 54:39.400
Yeah I don't buy that.

54:39.400 --> 54:44.400
I don't buy that the number one page getting hit on distro watch dot com is mint Linux that doesn't seem.

54:44.400 --> 54:46.400
I did just say that as a joke.

54:46.400 --> 54:52.400
So just so you know I know but it is a thing and it does get quoted all the time all the time.

54:52.400 --> 54:56.400
Yeah yeah as if it's a fact that it's the best because of that.

54:56.400 --> 55:04.400
And if you go to any if you go to any conference and somebody does a talk about Linux distribution share they always always always cite distro watch always.

55:04.400 --> 55:10.400
And I don't it's like it but distro watch numbers are just simply reflective of traffic within distro watch.

55:10.400 --> 55:17.400
So a lot of people think I'll make a make a collection of here's what MIT has and then here's all the official flavors of Bantu and see what the differences.

55:17.400 --> 55:22.400
I would bet it's a massively for the Bantu.

55:22.400 --> 55:24.400
Yeah well OK.

55:24.400 --> 55:28.400
All right so closing thoughts from the night ladies night.

55:28.400 --> 55:31.400
Did you want to jump in with your thoughts before we wrapped up.

55:31.400 --> 55:34.400
Because I know you did you were muted earlier.

55:34.400 --> 55:36.400
Sure I kind of just agreed with what you guys said.

55:36.400 --> 55:38.400
I don't personally use mint.

55:38.400 --> 55:50.400
I don't know at this point I think in the past they were you know really popular and still are popular but I think they've kind of been replaced or at least there's other distros that provide the same thing that they're offering.

55:50.400 --> 55:52.400
And so they're not unique anymore.

55:52.400 --> 55:58.400
Oh man Jesus is the episode everybody's going to hate because all the mint listeners are going to listen in and they're going to hate us.

55:58.400 --> 55:59.400
I feel really bad about it.

55:59.400 --> 56:03.400
So listen next week if you want to do a little follow up you are totally welcome.

56:03.400 --> 56:14.400
You listen out there to join us in the Mamba room and tell us where we've gotten things wrong because I was really hoping somebody in the Mamba room would step up and defend mint because I didn't want it to be a total mint hate session.

56:14.400 --> 56:15.400
That's not hate.

56:15.400 --> 56:18.400
It's just we're just questioning what's happening.

56:18.400 --> 56:23.400
User experience in the sense of like the updates that they have the structured things like the one.

56:23.400 --> 56:24.400
Yes one through five thing.

56:24.400 --> 56:26.400
I mean that's nice for some people.

56:26.400 --> 56:32.400
Not the kind of people on mint that you know enjoy that because it's really easy to deal with and then you don't have to worry about something breaking.

56:32.400 --> 56:33.400
So I guess there's that.

56:33.400 --> 56:41.400
Yeah and speed testing the mirrors totally solid really awesome and going to be completely made irrelevant by snap packages.

56:41.400 --> 56:44.400
Ubuntu does that as well.

56:44.400 --> 56:54.400
Yeah I think the I don't know I think the updater and the PPA manager built into mint are kind of nice but I'm not joking when I say when we can when we switch over to snap packages.

56:54.400 --> 56:56.400
You won't be using those tools to update your system anymore.

56:56.400 --> 57:03.400
So that's a short term win.

57:03.400 --> 57:04.400
I know I'm sorry I didn't.

57:04.400 --> 57:06.400
I think I was trying to end on a positive note.

57:06.400 --> 57:21.400
But on the upside on the upside there is one positive thing that one of the releases on the news they did say that they're going to use a 1.14 and at least and might even do 1.16.

57:21.400 --> 57:25.400
So they're not necessarily staying back on the old versions of Monte.

57:25.400 --> 57:27.400
That would be good.

57:27.400 --> 57:33.400
I don't totally see I for me and maybe when we can you clear it up for me I don't understand where the line is with Monte.

57:33.400 --> 57:40.400
I don't as for me I know there's like a there's one version that's GT more GTK one version GTK 3 when GTK 2.

57:40.400 --> 57:45.400
I don't what or how do I as a as a sort of a made observer I'm a observer.

57:45.400 --> 57:46.400
How do I keep it straight.

57:46.400 --> 57:55.400
Right. So all of Monte can be built by the distro maintain it against the toolkit that they choose.

57:55.400 --> 57:57.400
So there is one version of Monte.

57:57.400 --> 58:00.400
The current version is 1.14.

58:00.400 --> 58:08.400
You can choose to compile that against GTK 2 or you can choose to compile it against GTK 3.

58:08.400 --> 58:15.400
Some distributions are going to start building it against GTK 3 because we now feel that it's ready.

58:15.400 --> 58:22.400
And some distributions will continue to build it against GTK 2 because they feel it needs a bit longer.

58:22.400 --> 58:28.400
I see. And by some distributions is it other is it Zubuntu and no not Zubuntu because it's Mate.

58:28.400 --> 58:32.400
So it's Linux Mint Mate that's not going to.

58:32.400 --> 58:39.400
As I understand it Linux Mint 18 is going to build Monte against GTK 2.

58:39.400 --> 58:43.400
So we're going to have sort of a split is what is kind of what I'm seeing here.

58:43.400 --> 58:48.400
And I don't understand I don't I don't I don't quite understand what the impact of that is.

58:48.400 --> 58:52.400
Well I think it will remain to be seen.

58:52.400 --> 59:04.400
I think the impact will be that in the Marte 1.14 development cycle almost exclusively all of the development effort was focused on GTK 3 support improving GTK 3 support.

59:04.400 --> 59:10.400
And some of the components in Marte only build against GTK 3 now.

59:10.400 --> 59:21.400
Subsequent development cycles will continue to be focused on GTK 3 with the eventual goal to decommission GTK 2 stuff.

59:21.400 --> 59:29.400
That's not going to happen in 1.16 probably not in 1.18 because we'll keep it around long enough for people to transition.

59:29.400 --> 59:34.400
But the other thing there's also pressure coming from distributions themselves.

59:34.400 --> 59:47.400
So for example Arch Linux Fedora Debian all have bugs open about libraries they are seeking to deprecate because they're old and unmaintained.

59:47.400 --> 59:54.400
And they raise bugs against the other software that uses these old deprecated.

59:54.400 --> 59:57.400
I would imagine that's just the tip of the iceberg too.

59:57.400 --> 01:00:08.400
Yeah so there's been pressure for some time to move Marte to GTK 3 so that we can adopt the newer implementations of common libraries.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:12.400
So things like the GTK source view for the editors and stuff.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.400
Lib VTE for the terminals.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.400
I can't remember all of them but there's a collection.

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:27.400
So we are not being pressured or strong armed but there is some gentle pressure to sort of move people along to the newer supported technologies.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:34.400
For example some of the stuff some of the libraries have security vulnerabilities and aren't maintained anymore.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:45.400
So you have to move to the newer versions of the libraries in order to get to the current version that is being security patched.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:50.400
You know what solves that? Snappy.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:58.400
Interesting. I guess yeah that was I got a tweet that said why would you want Marte to go to GTK 3?

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:04.400
That's the whole point of Marte is to be like Gnome 2 resurrected.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:10.400
And so that sort of explains that it's mostly there's just a lot of other ecosystem pressures and advantages.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:18.400
So realistically that point I get a lot so let's just make that absolutely clear.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.400
GTK 3 is not Gnome 3.

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:25.400
A lot of people don't seem to be able to unpick those two things.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:30.400
They seem to think that GTK 3 means that you get some new desktop paradigm.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.400
That's not what it means at all.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:42.400
Unless you're a really observant Marte user if you run Marte 1.14 with the default Marte theme.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:52.400
So not the Ubuntu Marte theme the default theme that we developed in Marte on GTK 2 and you have another VM with it running the GTK 3 version.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.400
They are almost indistinguishable from one another.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.400
Right. We're just talking the toolkit here that the applications are using.

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:13.400
Exactly. But the thing that's important about GTK 3 and the thing that's most important for me not personally but the thing I think is most important is GTK 3 opens the gateway to high DPI.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.400
Oh yes.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.400
And GTK 2 doesn't do that.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:25.400
And the other benefit and this is a longer term goal is GTK 3 opens the door to things like Wayland and Mir and GTK 2 doesn't.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:35.400
So in order for the traditional desktop to remain relevant we have to adopt the technologies that allow us to support the new technology.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:38.400
The light at the end of the tunnel is a fast approaching train called Wayland.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.400
I mean that is that is sort of the bottom line right there.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:49.400
But see when I and this is where I went off the rails I think for a lot of people in last but where because I can't help but come from a security angle.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:58.400
And I think to myself rationally all of the money energy effort time is being spent now on GTK 3.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:05.400
And so if if you want things that are secure and updated and maintained you have to you have to move to GTK 3.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.400
Do you agree with that assessment Wimpy.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.400
Yeah I do.

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:21.400
And that's where I think again I mean so security isn't just managing your Web site installation correctly it isn't just properly verifying ISO's.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:37.400
Security is a layered thing that happens at all layers from from from shipping your system with updated secure software that continues to be maintained and updated for security purposes.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.400
That is part of a responsible secure desktop.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:46.400
It's not it's not just one thing to do if you're shipping software to a lot of people.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.400
Yeah OK.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.400
So that's good insight Wimpy.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.400
Thank you.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:04:05.400
I I was I was not understanding fully and I and I guess the other part I don't fully understand is there are going to be some things that don't work with Matei built against GTK 3 which would probably be the biggest reason Clem would have not to use it.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:10.400
Because he wouldn't want to scare the users with features not existing all of a sudden.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:17.400
Yeah so Mint and Ubuntu Matei are at different points in their release cycle at the moment.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:24.400
Clem is just about to embark on another LTS effectively what we've just done with Ubuntu 16.04.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:29.400
So he's going to pick stable tried and true because that's his shtick.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.400
So that's what he's going to go for.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:36.400
I've just entered into the Ubuntu 16.10 development cycle.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:39.400
We've got a solid LTS behind us.

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:44.400
Now is the time to break all the toys and to try out all the new stuff.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.400
Sure.

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:49.400
And spend the next two years building towards the next LTS.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:05:04.400
And with regards to what isn't going to work there are some plugins and extensions for Matei in particular for the image viewer and plume of the text editor that are written in Python and use PyGTK2.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.400
That's the underlying library.

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:10.400
PyGTK2 is not simply not compatible with GTK 3.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.400
Can't be done.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:15.400
So those plugins that are written using those libraries are disabled.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:20.400
In fact I patched them out and there's maybe I don't know six or seven of them.

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:25.400
And then there are some third party panel applets.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:36.400
So panel applets that aren't maintained by the Matei desktop team that are maintained by community contributors that are currently only targeting GTK2.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:42.400
Now I've contacted all of the authors of that software and told them that this change is coming.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:51.400
And I've given them some pointers about how they can either make the transition to GTK3 or how they can dual support both toolkits.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:56.400
So some of that work we're going to have to do within the Matei desktop team.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:02.400
Some of that work is going to be on the shoulders of the people that develop and maintain that software.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:17.400
And what I'm going to try and do is use the donations that the Ubuntu Matei community have made to Ubuntu Matei to help those developers complete that work over maybe the next year.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:23.400
With the intention I would assume to have things sort of shaped up and ready to ship by the next LTS.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.400
Yes that's the idea.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:34.400
So I think probably Ubuntu Matei 16.10 is going to be a bit of a bumpy release because we are breaking all the toys.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:43.400
We're almost going back to sort of square one and starting again with a new toolkit.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:52.400
Now it's not quite square one because we've learned an awful lot in the last two years and developed a lot of integration pieces that we will be able to carry through.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:58.400
Because everything that I've worked on in Ubuntu Matei in the last two years has been GTK3.

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.400
So that's all good to go.

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.400
So I just wanted a point of clarification.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:11.400
So your patrons got an update from you and where you talked a little bit about collaborating a lot more with the Fedora project.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.400
That's a hell of a tease.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:18.400
I mean do you understand that you are a Linux distro and they are a Linux distro.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.400
These kinds of things just aren't done.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:26.400
Yeah you're not supposed to. You're supposed to create your own applications with your own theme and your own release cycles.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:30.400
This I don't understand. Is there any clarifications because my world is spinning.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.400
What does Ubuntu Matei working closely with the Fedora project mean? I'm lost.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:41.400
Well Matei desktop in itself is made up. The team members are made up of a cross distribution group of people.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:52.400
So Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Slackware, Arch, BSD. There's a whole range of people working on different distributions.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:56.400
But working towards making the Matei desktop work in those distributions.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:04.400
It just so happens that the Ubuntu and Fedora release cycles are very closely aligned with one another.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:14.400
I know we joke about Fedora delaying and what have you but despite that within a few weeks they're very close to one another.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:23.400
So Wolfgang Albrecht who's a Matei desktop developer and is also the maintainer for Matei in Fedora.

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:30.400
He is a highly skilled theme developer for GTK 2 and GTK 3.

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:40.400
He does all of the theme maintainership for the Matei themes that we ship as part of the Matei upstream project.

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:52.400
But he has helped out other distributions and other spins of Fedora that are now using versions of the Matei themes in Fedora and other distributions.

01:08:52.400 --> 01:09:02.400
Because it's about the best GTK 3.20 theme implementation you can get outside of what comes from GNOME.

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:07.400
And it's got that dual theming for GTK 2 and GTK 3.

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:16.400
So he's very experienced and highly skilled and I don't know that theming stuff particularly well.

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:27.400
So I'm going to be working with Wolfgang to build on his skill and experience to bring that work into the Ubuntu Matei themes for Matei.

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:33.400
But more importantly I've spoken to some of the developers for Ubuntu.

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:46.400
And we're going to try and then, because the Matei themes, the Ubuntu Matei themes are very very closely linked to the versions, the Ubuntu light themes.

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.400
You know, ambience and radiance and what have you.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:57.400
And I'm going to try and see if we can give back some merge proposals from the Ubuntu Matei themes back to upstream Ubuntu.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:03.400
So that they get the GTK 3.20 support in the Ubuntu themes.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:14.400
And so it's actually going to be a sort of Ubuntu, Ubuntu, Matei, Fedora sort of cross collaboration effort to sort of bring everything up to GTK 3.20.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.400
That's really cool.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.400
Yeah.

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:21.400
So now just a real talk Wimpy, just you and me, nobody else is here just for a moment.

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:26.400
You think Unity 8 is going to be just a boon for Ubuntu Matei edition?

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:29.400
What do you think?

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.400
I don't know.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:35.400
Come on, I was trying to be, you must say yes.

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:46.400
No, because Mark Shuttleworth made it clear some years ago that there wouldn't be a switch to Unity 8 unless the community wanted it.

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:51.400
You know, when the community was ready for that transition then that's when it would happen.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.400
And until that happens there's Unity 7.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:00.400
As we've discussed earlier, there's an awful lot of people that like and use Unity 7.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.400
Hello.

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.400
They've got their safe harbor.

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:04.400
Yeah.

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:16.400
You know, here's my response to that, which is completely unjustified and based in no reality or fact and does not represent the present at all.

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.400
So that's my disclaimer before I say this.

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:24.400
Because Popeye's world is the reality right now where there's people out there using Unity and, goll darn it, they love it.

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.400
Getting their job done.

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:35.400
A lot of these are probably like people that got computers put in front of them, you know, like the millions of Dells that got deployed and all these different places.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:38.400
I have a dream.

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:44.400
I have a vision that the next wave of Linux users are exhausted Mac users and exhausted Windows users.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:48.400
And I believe that's not going to come in a huge, huge, huge shift.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:53.400
I believe it's just going to be a ramp that continues to accelerate up and up and up more people.

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.400
They'll be exasperated by Apple.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:05.400
And I could, the list of why you, as somebody who has to be, who has a couple of Macs left in production and has to deal with their limitations, I promise you,

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:13.400
while they are great machines for way more people than there are Linux users and will be for a really long time,

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:20.400
for a certain audience, the exact kind of audience that Linux is appealing to, they are extremely frustrating.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:27.400
And there is a huge percentage that will be a massive growth for Linux coming over from them, from Windows 10 users,

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:31.400
especially as Steam OS grows and games are more and more supported on Linux.

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.400
There is going to be a new wave, I believe, of Linux users.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:39.400
And it's not all at once, like I said, but ramping up and they will be making an educated choice.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:41.400
And I, you know what?

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.400
I'll give it to them.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.400
I have given the man a hard time for a long time.

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:49.400
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:55.400
But I actually think Leo legitimately represents the cutting wave of tech enthusiasts.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:01.400
People who are, and I know, I'm saying this about somebody who is, by most people's account, now a little out of date.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:04.400
But I actually think he's on to something here.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:09.400
He today, today is experimenting with Debian on his Google Pixel.

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:12.400
And, you know, he's talking about getting the external...

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.400
That's pretty cool.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.400
Yeah, and he's talking about how the trackpad works and all.

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.400
I mean, he is legitimately all in on this.

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:24.400
And I think he represents somebody, I think Chase does as well, somebody who is actually educated on this stuff

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:30.400
and enjoys computers and is enthusiastic about hardware, is enthusiastic about software,

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.400
wants to use their computer to its fullest.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:36.400
Windows and the Mac no longer offer this.

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:39.400
And this is just the beginning of it.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.400
It's just going to get worse.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.400
And I think these people will be coming to Linux.

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:49.400
And I don't think a desktop environment that looks like it was designed eight years ago

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:53.400
by a company that's put it on life support will be appealing to a lot of these people.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.400
I think some of them will choose Unity.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:59.400
But I think for most of them, Unity 7 will look like yesterday's game.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.400
And I think Unity 8 won't be ready yet.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.400
So for most of them, they're just going to go with something easy, practical.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.400
Boom, and it works.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.400
What do you think?

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:08.400
Hmm.

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.400
You think I'm crazy?

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:15.400
No, I'm not sure how many Mac users are going to be brought over

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.400
because they've paid a premium for that whole Apple experience.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.400
There is, yeah, that's true.

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:29.400
It will only be potentially developers that have got Mac hardware that would be prepared to make that switch, I think.

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.400
But that is literally, that's millions.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:42.400
Yeah, and anecdotally, I don't see that many people switching to Ubuntu that are using Mac hardware,

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:50.400
unless it's quite old Mac hardware and they're looking to extend the life of their computer

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:54.400
because the version of Mac OS X that they can run on their machine is...

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:58.400
No, you know, I'll tell you about the Mac user that I'm picturing.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.400
I'm picturing a Mac user that buys a ThinkPad.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.400
I'm picturing a Mac user that buys an Intraware Apollo

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:08.400
because part of becoming a frustrated Mac user is becoming frustrated with the hardware options

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:12.400
because literally the worst thing Apple has going for it right now is its hardware.

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:17.400
All of the graphics cards in all Macs are an absolute and total joke.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.400
All of the storage options are a total joke in terms of cost.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:24.400
They have been doing nothing with the MacBook line.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:26.400
The Mac mini hasn't been updated in 200 years.

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:31.400
The Trashcan has a video card that's now three generations at least out of date.

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.400
I mean, the Mac hardware is in a bad state.

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:37.400
And so I think one of the number one things, I think it's well built.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.400
I think it lasts a long time.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.400
It's still pretty.

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:46.400
And I think there should be more attention, energy, and effort spent on making Linux work just super well on Mac hardware,

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:50.400
including figuring out the SMC controller so we can manage thermals.

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.400
I think that would be a huge thing to get more people,

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:59.400
but I don't think it's a number one priority because I think this type of user just gets sick and tired of it.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:06.400
They go out there and they look what they can buy in a ThinkPad or an Apollo for $1,000 less,

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.400
and they think, well, I'm just going to switch.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.400
And then they don't drop the Mac.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.400
They keep the Mac around.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:16.400
And some people have, you know, yeah, you are right.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.400
There are Mac users out there who will make a switch.

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.400
I'm not sure they're the majority of Mac users.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:30.400
I think disgruntled Windows users is a larger potential market.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:34.400
And in the last, I don't know, three or four years,

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:50.400
Microsoft have dropped the ball a couple of times when if Linux or a major Linux distribution was more ready to absorb those disgruntled Windows users,

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.400
I think we could have seen more people coming over.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.400
So there are choices.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:59.400
There is Linux Mint, and there is Ubuntu Mate, and there is Ubuntu proper.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:04.400
So just as another anecdote, and I don't know, this is one of the things I love about our lug,

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:13.400
but so my lady friend, Hadia, has her own practice that she runs a business, and she has a couple of computers there.

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:20.400
And so she has a Lenovo that runs Ubuntu Mate 14.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:23.400
I can't actually remember which one it runs.

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:25.400
I hope she pays someone else for IT, Chris.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.400
Oh, no, no, I do remember.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.400
It's 1510, actually.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.400
It's 1510.

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:38.400
And Wimby, she has been so impressed with it that the other computers in her office which run Windows 7,

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:45.400
she's just been offended by the whole prompts to upgrade to Windows 10 the whole time and interrupting her and all of that,

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:51.400
that she just wants to replace all of them with – she's looking at – what is she – I think they're called HP Stream.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.400
Is that something – is that –

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:58.400
She's looking at HP Streams and wants to know if I'll install Ubuntu Mate on them and just replace the other terminals.

01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.400
And how does that make you feel, Chris?

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.400
Well, I think it's amazing, and it's not even prompted by me at all.

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:10.400
It's just that she's like, well, this has been problem-free on my laptop, and it's – she's now using her personal laptop to do like data entry sometimes.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:14.400
And she's like, so now I made this my work machine, and now I want to put all of my work machines on Linux.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.400
And the security just happens to be –

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:20.400
Yeah, especially if you're someone like that where you can kind of control all of your business stuff, right?

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:23.400
Then you can just go wholeheartedly to Linux, and it just works great.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.400
It was interesting.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:27.400
She went from like, this is my personal computer that I write onto.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:31.400
Well, now this is my work computer, and I keep it at work because I like working on Linux more.

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:37.400
And I think – what I found interesting about that is she's not doing it from an advocate's position.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:41.400
She's doing it from a practical decision for her business.

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.400
Business owner.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.400
Yeah.

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:48.400
And that is also a huge area for a very practical desktop like Mate.

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:54.400
You'd already be fine, too, but for her, the transition over to Mate is literally like no transition at all.

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:55.400
Welcome screen.

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:56.400
Yeah.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:57.400
Yeah.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:06.400
And what you've just described is consistent with what I've learned talking to small business owners in my local community.

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:13.400
There's a frightening amount of small businesses that are one or two or three employees,

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:19.400
so homegrown businesses that are still running their operation on Windows XP.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:25.400
Some of the companies I've spoken to have actually bought new computers a couple of years ago,

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:34.400
but don't have the wherewithal to make the transition from one Windows computer to the next Windows computer.

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:35.400
Right.

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:41.400
Don't really understand it, and they need people to come in and actually help them do those transitions.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:47.400
But when you look at what they're using, they're not using a lot of the facilities of Windows.

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:51.400
A lot of them are very disgruntled with Windows because they buy a new computer.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:20:00.400
They expect it to be faster than their old computer, and invariably it isn't because they're buying budget computers running a modern version of Windows,

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:04.400
and it's actually slower than their old computer that's running Windows XP.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:07.400
The number of people unhappy with Windows XP is just amazing, surprising and amazing to me.

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:14.400
So a lot of small business owners I hear are really cheesed off with Windows, and they really want to make the switch.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:21.400
And what people know about, when they start researching, they find two things.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:30.400
They find either Mac OS X, which is quite often economically not viable, or they find Ubuntu.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:33.400
And those are the two things that these businesses find.

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:38.400
So when I talk to people, they've found out about Ubuntu, and then I start the conversation about,

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:45.400
well, if you're familiar with Windows and you want to use a computer in a way that's familiar to you, you could use this.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:51.400
But if you want to use this version, then it works slightly differently, and this is how it looks.

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.400
And I sort of explain those differences.

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:58.400
But there's a lot of local businesses around here that are making the switch to Linux.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:01.400
Do you find people are doing more research about this than they used to?

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:07.400
Yeah, and the other thing I found is that they're actually trying to find local companies

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:15.400
who can support them running Linux, and I'm struggling to find people that can do that in my local area.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:18.400
So I'm in Hampshire in the UK.

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:23.400
So if you're listening to this, and you're in Hampshire in the UK, and you offer Linux support services,

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:28.400
let me know, because I'll hand out your business details to these people when I speak to them.

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.400
Fine, Wimpy. Tell him.

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:36.400
Yeah, okay, we totally went off on a sidebar, but I think it's interesting that our two experiences have lined up.

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:43.400
So there is a business group that I have attended several times that's just local businesses,

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:50.400
and so the way this business group works is only one person from each profession can go there.

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:51.400
Oh, funny.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:53.400
And Hadi is the one that introduced me to it.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:54.400
B&I?

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.400
What's that?

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.400
Is it called B&I?

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:02.400
No. That sounds like a dirty thing you do.

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:03.400
Come on, Rob.

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:05.400
Get out of here, Rob.

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:06.400
It's just Networking International.

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:07.400
Come on, Ron.

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:09.400
They have the exact same model.

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:12.400
Okay, because for a second there, I – okay, for a second.

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:13.400
Get it out of here.

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.400
True. It does sound weird.

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:21.400
And yeah, they have a web developer in the group, and the web developer uses Linux.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:27.400
And he talks about it sometimes with the group, and it's very fascinating to see different people who just get into –

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:30.400
now looking into something a little bit further than they used to in the past.

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:33.400
It felt like people would just take the PC and whatever it came with.

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:39.400
But something about – and I think – I'm not saying it's a big – I'm not saying it's like this huge movement,

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:43.400
but I think in part for some people, like the Windows 10 prompting to get you to upgrade

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:47.400
and the way Microsoft has handled this has really pissed off a lot of business owners

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:51.400
who the one thing they want out of their PCs is they want predictability.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.400
That is an effing tool.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.400
I pay my staff to do their work here, not mess with the computer.

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.400
And that thing needs to work the way I expect it to.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.400
I mean, it's the same as a copy.

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:00.400
You just want it to work.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:01.400
You bought it to work.

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:02.400
Right.

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:07.400
And I can tell you as somebody who used to fix business machines for his living as a contractor,

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:12.400
I bore the brunt of the anger from the business owner when that effing computer wasn't working.

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:18.400
And he wanted to understand why it wasn't working as a damn tool because he spent $600 or something like that on it.

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:26.400
So the idea now that some people – and I – I don't want to make a big deal out of this,

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.400
but do you find there – do you find it to be people that are maybe in their 30s and 40s

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:35.400
that are now business owners that are just sort of more of an internet savvy generation?

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:39.400
Because that was my experience is that these people are just now getting a generation of people

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:41.400
that are going to be business owners that know how to use Google.

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.400
Right.

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:50.400
And have also – have also been using Windows for 15 years or more in some cases

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:55.400
and are really sick to the back teeth of it, really ready for change.

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:58.400
I hear those words quite frequently that they're ready for a change.

01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.400
Yeah.

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.400
And it's really because they just – they're at their wits end.

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:05.400
They feel that any change can't be worse.

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:06.400
Yeah.

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.400
Exactly.

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:08.400
Wow.

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.400
Okay.

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.400
Well, so that was a bit of a sidebar, but I want to keep going on.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:15.400
I want to give a special mention to one of our favorite open source projects who's doing a Kickstarter right now.

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:18.400
But first I'm going to give a real special mention to Linux Academy.

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:22.400
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged to support the show and get yourself a discount.

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:25.400
Nine dollars for the first 30 days over at Linux Academy.

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:26.400
That is such a deal.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.400
Holy smokes, man.

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:28.400
You got to check them out.

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:33.400
They have so many great self-paced courses, 2,389 as of this here recording,

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.400
but that's just the tip of the iceberg.

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.400
They've got downloadable comprehensive study guides.

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:40.400
They've got a whole bunch of distros you can choose from that automatically adjust the courseware

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:44.400
and the virtual machines that they'll spin up on demand and give you SSH access.

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:50.400
I think what I like about Linux Academy though the most isn't their killer, killer, killer, killer dashboard

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:54.400
that really helped me quantify how long it takes to do certain things into just hours.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:59.400
I mean that was great, but what I really like about it is the people that run Linux Academy.

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:04.400
I started communicating with Linux Academy way before they were ever a sponsor.

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.400
Really?

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:09.400
I've never told this story.

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:10.400
Linux Unplugged special folks.

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:11.400
Yeah.

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:16.400
I should tell this story because it tells you really more about Linux Academy as a company.

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:20.400
We started talking to Linux Academy before we announced how to Linux,

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:29.400
however long ago that was to the public as a way to try to figure out how to amp up our show segments.

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:34.400
Like here's something you could do to spin up a server, but if you want to know more go do this

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:39.400
and then we were going to replicate essentially the exact steps you could follow that we did on the show

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:45.400
in their virtual environment and then they would take it up from there and tell you to do more things.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.400
This is when they were just experimenting with the technology

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:55.400
because they really came from an angle of how can we show more people in the community at large

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:59.400
how to use Linux properly and like even people who are self-taught

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:04.400
or people who want to get into it to help support it for small businesses or for their company or for whatever

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.400
or people that just want to make a buck off it and build off the technology around Linux

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:14.400
and maybe properly use those things and that's everything from Amazon Web Services to Android to OpenStack

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:20.400
and Ruby on Rails and PHP, all the technology around it, how to use that properly.

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:25.400
And that properly, you can learn a lot from a lot of places how to do a basic configuration,

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:30.400
get it working on one machine, but if you have to suddenly support like 50 or 500 machines

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:33.400
then Linux Academy is really what you need.

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:37.400
Man, the thing that's great about Linux Academy too is when you've got to go into a whole new world

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:41.400
that feels like a different language and a different way of thinking about things,

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:46.400
the fact that they can break down like getting through that barrier into amount of time for me

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:50.400
and the fact that they have an availability planner where I'll go say, okay, I've got this much time this week,

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:54.400
which is often not much, and they still manage to make it worth my time.

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:55.400
And you learn something.

01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:59.400
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged, they've got detailed notes, they've got practice exams,

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:02.400
they've got instructor mentoring when you need it and they've got a community stacked

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:04.400
full of Jupyter Broadcasting members.

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:08.400
A big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program now.

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:13.400
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged, go there, support the show and find out more.

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:17.400
So Corita is an application we talk about a lot.

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:22.400
Mr. Westra, you are in the mumble room, so I don't make a jerk face out of myself.

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:25.400
How do I properly describe what type of application Corita is?

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:31.400
It's a drawing app, but that seems like calling it, that sounds like paint.

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.400
I mean, it's way more than a drawing app.

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:37.400
What is Corita and how do you use it?

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:38.400
Westra, go.

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.400
I don't hear, did he leave?

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.400
That was such a good buildup.

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:42.400
Did you like my buildup?

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:43.400
Oh, absolutely.

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:47.400
Yeah, I felt like that was, I felt like I could tweet that buildup.

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:49.400
I could tweet that, that was so good.

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:52.400
I almost wish I could play it back immediately and hear my own buildup.

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.400
I enjoyed that so much.

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:55.400
I enjoyed it so much.

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:57.400
I would just play the Corita video that would tell you.

01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:58.400
Yeah, let's do it.

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.400
But you know what, all they have is music.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:04.400
You know, you remember a couple of weeks ago when I said you need to have music and I said,

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:09.400
here's an example of like a little tune you could play to jazz up your...

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:10.400
Jazz it up.

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:13.400
Yeah, you just give it a little oomph.

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:16.400
You could, you know, you could talk about anything and you got this playing.

01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:18.400
Oh, yeah, flats.

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.400
I'll buy whatever you're selling.

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:21.400
Well, the Corita project took that...

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:22.400
Let me tell you about Windows 10, Chris.

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:23.400
They took that too far.

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:27.400
So everybody, if you're watching the show, close your eyes for a second.

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:31.400
I want you to experience the show like our vast audio audience does,

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:35.400
because if you think about it from that perspective,

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:39.400
this has got to be one of the worst Kickstarter project videos ever.

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.400
So imagine you're listening to the show if you're watching right now.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.400
Almost an opposite of what we often do.

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:48.400
So if you are watching the show, you're at a disadvantage, close your eyes and listen.

01:28:48.400 --> 01:29:05.400
This video is going to tell you all about this Corita Kickstarter.

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:33.400
I think you get the idea.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:38.400
That's why I'm saying not a great Kickstarter video to describe what the...

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.400
I'm just...

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:40.400
Here's why.

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.400
I'm not...

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:45.400
I sound like I'm being a jerk, but what I'm doing is I'm giving away consulting services.

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:48.400
Instead of charging you $100 an hour, I'm just giving this away for free right here.

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:51.400
So if Corita Project, if you're listening, voiceovers.

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:53.400
You know who's got a great voice?

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:56.400
That Popeye guy's got a great voice.

01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:00.400
I mean, I know he's busy, but I would just like, you know, maybe tweet him.

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:02.400
He's probably ready to secretly use Corita as well.

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:06.400
He might be ready to secretly use Corita.

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:10.400
So just poke him and say, hey, Popeye, would you...

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:14.400
In fact, if all the Kickstarter projects out there would just tweet Popeye

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:17.400
and ask him, he would do the voiceover.

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.400
Stop it, Wes.

01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.400
You're making it hard for me to say it.

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.400
I just think that would be a really good idea.

01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.400
So anyways, back on track.

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:29.400
The Corita Project, Corita 2016, let's make text and vector art awesome.

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:31.400
It's got 317 backers.

01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.400
A noble goal.

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.400
I mean, it's already a great program.

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:37.400
They've got a goal of $34,215.

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:42.400
They've only raised $11,907 at the moment, but they have 28 days to go.

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:45.400
So you can go over there and find out more about it.

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:46.400
I think it would be pretty cool.

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:48.400
They'll support SVGs now.

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.400
Yeah, I'm really excited.

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:52.400
I agree, yeah.

01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:55.400
And look, Wes, they are distributing an app image, which is fascinating.

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:56.400
Oh, cool.

01:30:56.400 --> 01:31:01.400
Yeah, they have one here for CentOS 6 and Ubuntu 12.04.

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:05.400
Ubuntu 12.04.

01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:07.400
What is that about?

01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.400
And then they just have a general app image.

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:12.400
Hey, everyone, all the cool kids are still on Ubuntu 12.04, Chris.

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.400
Yeah, that is true.

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:14.400
I wonder if anybody –

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:16.400
Upstart.

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:19.400
So, Corita Project, trying to raise a little bit of funds.

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:22.400
Wes, your thoughts – actually, this is really kind of what I want to talk about.

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:25.400
What do you think about the idea of booster funding?

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:26.400
So you've got a project –

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:29.400
They're kind of doing it in their own way.

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:30.400
Yeah, about once a year –

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:31.400
It seems to be working, though.

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:35.400
Once a year, you raise about $30,000, $40,000, let's say.

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:38.400
The idea that an open source project could once a year come out and say,

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.400
hey, would you mind funding us?

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:42.400
This is what we'd like to accomplish this year.

01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.400
That seems like kind of a solid idea.

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:45.400
It does seem like a good idea.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:48.400
Especially if you – I mean, I agree the video could be better,

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:52.400
but if you lay out a good set of achievable goals

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:56.400
and once you get a good track record of meeting those goals, which they have.

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:58.400
I mean, they've improved their program a lot.

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:00.400
I could see myself as someone who uses Corita

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:03.400
and wants some of these vector capabilities in a program I know.

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:04.400
I would pay for that.

01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:07.400
Even as somebody who's now been burned by a couple of different fundraisers,

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:11.400
I feel like there's a couple of Kickstarters that are going to deliver.

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:14.400
Like when Pebble comes to Kickstarter and they say,

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:16.400
you know, you fund us and we'll ship a round watch,

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.400
I actually, even if I'm not interested in that product,

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:19.400
I believe they're going to do it.

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:21.400
I know they're going to deliver on that.

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:24.400
Corita, this isn't their first time doing this,

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:29.400
and if they come and say, you fund us and we're going to fund 2016, I buy that.

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:31.400
And I could see other ways.

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:34.400
I mean, we've talked a lot about Patreon, but I could see this as a solid way.

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:38.400
So I don't know, I'm curious what you guys think in the Mumble Room.

01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:43.400
Does anybody have a counter about using Kickstarter to fund open source?

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:46.400
Like a project that goes to the well about once a year and asks for funding.

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:48.400
It says, hello, everybody.

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:49.400
We would like funding.

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:50.400
Anybody?

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:51.400
What do you think about that?

01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:53.400
It seems to work for NPR.

01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:54.400
Yeah?

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:55.400
Yeah, that's true.

01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:57.400
Like a pledge drive.

01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:58.400
Huh.

01:32:58.400 --> 01:32:59.400
That is a good point.

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:02.400
If anything, less annoying.

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.400
Yeah, they are super annoying, aren't they?

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:10.400
That's why it seems, and also it seems, you know, now that I think about this,

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:14.400
it actually seems like a really horrible idea.

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:19.400
Yeah, because I could see what it creates is...

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:20.400
Oh, Python scripting plugin.

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.400
That sounds cool.

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:25.400
Maybe I'll just, I don't even use it, but maybe I'll give them some money.

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:26.400
That sounds great.

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.400
I actually think this is a horrible idea.

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:32.400
I think it creates sort of a false deadline to have to hit,

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.400
and certain things you have to do that maybe you commit to,

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:36.400
that you get to down at the end of the year,

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:38.400
and you're like, this is not what we should have been spending our time on,

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:40.400
or this is not what we can spend our time on,

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.400
then all of a sudden you're not delivering on your Kickstarter.

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:46.400
So perhaps the penguin is saying Patreon's a better way?

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:48.400
That seems like a more sustainable method,

01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:51.400
because then you're not trying to do a big splash.

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:52.400
Don't have those deadlines, yeah.

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:54.400
And it reminds me of like the Apple Keynotes

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:57.400
where they have to have a product announcement every WWDC.

01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:59.400
Even if it isn't a real product.

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.400
Yeah.

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:04.400
Even if it's just another Apple TV that's a little thicker or something.

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:05.400
Yeah.

01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:06.400
Yeah.

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:09.400
So I actually don't know if I actually bounty.

01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.400
And Alex Vada asked about BountySource,

01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:14.400
and boy, the elementary OS guys will sure tell you BountySource.

01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:17.400
BountySource, $15,000 BountySource.

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:19.400
I don't know, man.

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:20.400
I'm not seeing it.

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:22.400
I decided to put my money where my mouth was,

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:25.400
and I gave I think like $100 or something like that

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:27.400
to the elementary OS BountySource.

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:29.400
I don't know what happened to that.

01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:31.400
And I tell you what else,

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:34.400
I think if BountySource was going to be a success,

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:36.400
it would have happened by now.

01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:37.400
It's been around for ages,

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:39.400
and it just doesn't seem to be going anywhere.

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:41.400
I see developers go on and off it.

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:43.400
The elementary OS though seems to use it to some success,

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:45.400
but it doesn't seem to be a big thing.

01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:47.400
Just like Flatter hasn't become a big thing,

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:49.400
and bit tipping hasn't become a big thing,

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:52.400
and YouTube tips haven't become a big thing.

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:54.400
There's just a certain resistance to it.

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.400
Oh yeah, Flatter.

01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:59.400
Yeah, so I don't know.

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:02.400
Rod, you had a discussion with someone at Krita about Patreon.

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:04.400
How did that go?

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:07.400
They were saying that they couldn't think of any of the rewards.

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:09.400
That's why they haven't tried it.

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:11.400
So I gave them examples of what they could do,

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:13.400
and they said after the Kickstarter,

01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:15.400
they're going to look into starting a Patreon.

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.400
Yeah, I'll tell you, the rewards are the real son of a bitch.

01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:20.400
And we've missed them on all of ours,

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:22.400
and we're reworking ours right now.

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:25.400
That's funny too, because as a person who uses Patreon for other things,

01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:27.400
I don't care about the rewards.

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:29.400
I just want to give the people money.

01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:31.400
That's the thing, but as creators,

01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:33.400
we get super mental about these rewards.

01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:36.400
They're like this big psychological thing,

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:38.400
and the reality is,

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:41.400
then you want to make them worth something.

01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:44.400
So you aim big, but the reality is,

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:48.400
you're so damn busy just working on the everyday product.

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:51.400
If you had time to go off and do these big side projects,

01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:53.400
You'd have a second business already.

01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:56.400
And that is something I struggle with.

01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:59.400
With Unfilter right now, I'm struggling with that.

01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:02.400
We have something we're ready to roll out for our Unfilter supporters,

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:06.400
and the Unfilter news cycle is so crazy right now.

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.400
I'm so busy doing the show.

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.400
I don't have time to do anything else.

01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:14.400
Patreon.com today, by the way, go fund our network,

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:18.400
because holy smokes, we are so slammed right now.

01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:22.400
It's starting to feel like we're barely treading water.

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:26.400
There's so many things I am turning down right now.

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:29.400
It's rough out there.

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:32.400
And I honestly think this is a more sustainable method

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:35.400
than the Kickstarter sort of boop, boop, boop every year.

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:38.400
And the milestone thing is a really difficult thing,

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:44.400
so Rotten, tell them just be easy on themselves.

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:46.400
I showed them examples of projects

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.400
that are currently running Patreon

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:51.400
that don't have that very good rewards or even any at all.

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:53.400
And then I showed them an example of a good project

01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:56.400
that has pretty well thought out rewards,

01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:58.400
even though it's a sulfur product.

01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:02.400
And it's also, even some of the rewards are funny,

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:04.400
and that's Ubuntu MATE.

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:08.400
Well, here's what I'll tell you from my experience too.

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.400
So let's see, how many people?

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:12.400
We have 578 people.

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:13.400
Okay, so there's 500.

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:14.400
That's awesome.

01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:15.400
Wow, thank you.

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:18.400
578 people over at patreon.com slash today.

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:19.400
Heck yeah.

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:23.400
Man, that feels really good, and that is really super cool.

01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:26.400
So let me look through here to find the last time

01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:30.400
I did an exclusive, okay, perfect example.

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:35.400
For episode 143 of Unplugged, so last week's episode,

01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:39.400
I published a complete live stream version of the show

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:42.400
from the moment we went on the air to the moment we ended,

01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:44.400
like stuff that didn't go in the final edit.

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:46.400
Naughty, naughty Chris.

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:51.400
Right, so I said there's 578 patrons, 80 people watched that.

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:55.400
So I guess what I would say to those open source projects

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:59.400
out there that are looking at Patreon as a funding model,

01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:01.400
don't kill yourself over the rewards,

01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:03.400
because I work my butt off sometimes,

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:09.400
and then out of 578 people, 80 people watched the thing.

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:12.400
And that is just the reality of it,

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:15.400
because what they really want is the thing you're already doing.

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:17.400
That's why they're supporting you.

01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:20.400
Which, if you think about it, is super rewarding.

01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:21.400
That's the coolest part.

01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:23.400
That is exactly the coolest part.

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:25.400
So don't kill yourself on the rewards,

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:27.400
but try to deliver on what you commit to,

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:29.400
which is what I struggle with.

01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:30.400
Do your best.

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:34.400
Do your damn best, which we were reviewing our milestones,

01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:36.400
by the way, on the Patreon.

01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:37.400
We have exceeded some of them.

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.400
I wonder if anybody has noticed,

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:41.400
but there's some things we've done recently that exceed some.

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:46.400
But anyways, to the Creator Project and others,

01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:49.400
I would just, as my experience would go,

01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:52.400
and this reflects not just the Patreon for today,

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:55.400
this also reflects my experience with the Unfilter.

01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:57.400
Right.

01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:58.400
The same thing.

01:38:58.400 --> 01:38:59.400
Double-dipping.

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:02.400
I stopped producing a separate show for the patrons

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.400
because that was good content

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:06.400
that the rest of the audience could benefit from,

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:09.400
and 30 or 40, 60 people were downloading it

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:13.400
from the supporters out of way more than that

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.400
that support the show.

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:19.400
So well over 400 people that support the show,

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:22.400
and 30 or 40 of them would download the extra shows

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:25.400
that I was staying till midnight to edit and produce and upload.

01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:27.400
So it just didn't make sense.

01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:29.400
So I scaled it back, but now I'm trying to come up

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:31.400
to another area that still gives them value,

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:32.400
and that's still a really tight line to walk,

01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:34.400
and so you've got to find it and do it.

01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:36.400
But I would say to the Creator Project,

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:39.400
it could be something as simple as every now and then

01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:41.400
doing a Google Hangout with your community

01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:43.400
and chatting with them and just answering questions.

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:46.400
It doesn't have to be a big to-do.

01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:47.400
That's a great idea.

01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:49.400
Now we get to go a little fancy because over the years

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:52.400
we've established like swag partners and stuff like that.

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:55.400
So for us, we can do swag levels and things like that.

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:57.400
But you don't have to do that stuff.

01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:59.400
You don't have to go that far.

01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:02.400
You can just connect with your community

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:04.400
or spend an afternoon in the IRC room.

01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.400
Like, don't even have to do a Hangout.

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.400
It doesn't have to be super complicated stuff.

01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:12.400
And I think the reason why I want to mention Patreon

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:19.400
is it is fundamentally rewarding to be working

01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:22.400
for your audience and not for somebody

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:24.400
who's sponsoring you or giving you money.

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:26.400
Now, we still make more money from our sponsors

01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:28.400
than we do from our Patreon,

01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:32.400
but if I had one goal in 2016, it would be to flop that now.

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:34.400
That would be hard.

01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:37.400
But having now created shows,

01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:39.400
and this has I think got to be the same thing

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.400
when creating software,

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:43.400
having created shows from the perspective of

01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:45.400
what's the best way to sponsor this?

01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:48.400
Like, how do we format this so a sponsor fits in here

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:52.400
versus how do I format this so my patrons like it?

01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:53.400
That's totally different.

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:57.400
And the questions I answer and the ideas I come up with

01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.400
are really different when I'm starting

01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:00.400
from those two different premises.

01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:02.400
And I think it's got to be the same

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:03.400
for people who create software.

01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:07.400
And so I think not only does it benefit the creator,

01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:10.400
but I think it ultimately greatly benefits the end user

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:14.400
for having that model.

01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:15.400
There you go.

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:16.400
That's my thoughts on it.

01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:17.400
Well said.

01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:18.400
Yeah.

01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.400
See, I told you 144.

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:21.400
Lucky 144.

01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.400
A lot of different paths.

01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:24.400
But in the meantime,

01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.400
Creator Project is still seeking funding on their Kickstarter.

01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:28.400
Check them out.

01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:30.400
It would be really nice to see them.

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:31.400
I mean, if this is how they're choosing to do it,

01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:33.400
it would be really nice to see them be successful

01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:36.400
because we have more and more these days,

01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:39.400
sort of these iconic open source applications

01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:42.400
that are absolutely competitive with closed source solutions

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.400
or as competitive as they need to be.

01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:44.400
They deserve our support.

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:45.400
And they do.

01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:46.400
This is one of them.

01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:49.400
And if you have the money to spare,

01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:50.400
hey, look, they just gained another one.

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:51.400
If you have the money to spare, check them out.

01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:53.400
We'll have a link in the show notes.

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:56.400
Or just go search for Creator 2016 on the Kickstarter.

01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:58.400
I was going to have Mr. Westra talk about it

01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:01.400
because he does commissioned artwork and stuff

01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:03.400
and I'm pretty sure he uses Corita.

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:05.400
That's awesome.

01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:07.400
All right, Mumble Room,

01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:09.400
this is your last chance before we go.

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:11.400
I secretly use Arch Linux.

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:12.400
Oh, okay, great.

01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:13.400
Well, there was the input from Popey.

01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:14.400
No one asked.

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:16.400
He just likes to mention it though.

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:17.400
That does sound like an Arch user.

01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:18.400
Yeah.

01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:21.400
All right.

01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:24.400
Well, that brings us to the end of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:27.400
If you want to join us live, go to jplive.tv.

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:29.400
That's so true.

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:32.400
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for when we do this S live.

01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:34.400
My son said, Dad, why do you say S?

01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:35.400
I say S now in real life.

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:37.400
You're so polite.

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:39.400
It's these damn shows.

01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:42.400
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash context.

01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:43.400
You mean these D shows.

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:44.400
Yeah.

01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:46.400
Also, LinuxActionShow.reddit.com for feedback,

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.400
topic ideas, things like that.

01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:49.400
We'd love to have you live

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:51.400
and join us in our virtual lug next week.

01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:52.400
Won't you join us, neighbor?

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:54.400
See you right back here next Tuesday.

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:55.400
All right.

01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:22.400
Hit it, everybody.

01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:47.400
Man, did you notice how Noah totally blew starting the titles?

01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:48.400
That's super embarrassing.

01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:49.400
Why doesn't he do those things?

01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:50.400
I don't know.

01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:52.400
I guess he's probably doing stuff.

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:53.400
Anyways, thank you, Mumble Room.

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:54.400
Great discussion today.

01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:55.400
Yeah, absolutely.

01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:56.400
Oh, hey, look.

01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:57.400
And she says she updated the Patreon.

01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:58.400
Oh, boy.

01:43:58.400 --> 01:43:59.400
I'll check that out.

01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:02.400
Oh, what's going on over there?

01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:04.400
Anyways, Mumble Room, I love you.

01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:05.400
Thank you for being here.

01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:06.400
There we go.

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:07.400
Look at that.

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:10.400
That is that is fancy looking.

01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:14.400
Somebody say something because we haven't heard you for like five minutes.

01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:15.400
There we go.

01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:16.400
Thank you.

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:17.400
But it's a good show.

01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:18.400
Thank you for being here.

01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:19.400
Thank you.

01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:20.400
Thank you.

01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:21.400
Thank you.

01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:22.400
Now I'm off of it.

01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:24.400
I feel like actually it was actually very good.

01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:25.400
I got it out there.

01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:26.400
I got my concerns on the record.

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:27.400
Yes.

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:28.400
Mm hmm.

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:29.400
And there's really nothing else to say.

01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:30.400
We can move on.

01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:31.400
I really feel like that is the case.

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:32.400
Like there I've said what I need to say.

01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:35.400
There's just a lot in the air that needed to be.

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:41.400
Well, I actually what I realized was going on is I have I have been doing more and more

01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:47.400
self-censoring lately because I got it in my head from this show that people don't like

01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:49.400
it when I complain.

01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:52.400
So I have stopped complaining and I got it.

01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:56.600
I just I have been observing things about different projects and different things and

01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:01.640
I've just haven't been voicing my concerns because people don't like it when Chris complains.

01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:05.280
So I stopped complaining and we had a whole bunch of happy shows and everybody's great

01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:06.280
and everything.

01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:07.280
But then, you know what?

01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:10.720
Turns out, no, I feel a little righteous because I think I'm right about this and I do want

01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:11.940
to talk about it.

01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:15.360
And so I think I just crossed that line.

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:18.680
And now the problem is the floodgates open and now I'm want to complain about.

01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:19.880
Let's see how far we go.

01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:23.520
I want to complain about Anaconda being crap and getting screwed up every single damn release.

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:26.040
I want to complain about Unity looking like it's last year's game.

01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:28.800
I want to complain about every single thing.

01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:34.960
Yeah, that's all content, baby.

01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:36.240
That's what happens when I hold it in.

01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:38.440
I hold it in because nobody likes it.

01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:39.520
Nobody wants grumpy Chris.

01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:40.520
Well, guess what?

01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:41.520
Now?

01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:42.520
Now?

01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:43.520
Now?

01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:44.520
Guess what?

01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:45.520
Are you saying everybody hates Chris?

01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:46.520
No.

01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:53.000
The problem is I think what it is is a conspiracy by the lawn maintenance community.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.960
I'm having the worst luck during the weekdays.

01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:56.120
I really am.

01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:59.120
It's actually making me think about like, well, there's two options.

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:03.560
Is either I get that window taken out and that wall re-insulated, which seems crazy,

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:04.560
or we move.

01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:05.560
Right.

01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:12.000
And the window's nice in the summer when it's, you know.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000
I just don't know.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:19.160
Like, how many weeks in a row am I going to sit here and bitch about the lawn mower?

01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:24.320
And here's what's really sort of alarming about it, and this is really what gets me,

01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:30.040
is I could make this mistake again because if I came here and looked at the amount of

01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:36.160
yard here, I would go, oh, they'll do this once a month, and they'll be here for two,

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:39.600
three hours, and they'll be done, and the whole place will be done.

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:43.600
I would never have thought it would be three days a week every week because there's just

01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:45.840
literally, there's no yard here.

01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:46.840
No, there's really not.

01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:47.840
There's like nothing.

01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:48.840
Yeah.

01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:55.000
Well, I did kind of shout during TechSnap last week, and I think the guy heard me.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Oh, snap.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.720
TechSnap, that is.

01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:02.120
And you can hear it, you can hear it just a little bit, but you have to be listening

01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:04.840
because you only hear it while my face is making noise.

01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:11.440
As soon as my face stops making noise, our system cuts it out.

01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:14.480
So that's why you're not hearing it.

01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:17.360
So here's the problem, is I hear it all the time.

01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:19.760
I constantly hear it, and so it distracts me, and I'm...

01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:22.720
And then Rekai will edit the show, and then he'll play it for Chris, and Chris will hear

01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:23.720
it again.

01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:24.720
Yes, I do.

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:25.720
He'll criticize Rekai on barely.

01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:26.720
I do.

01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:28.160
I do listen to the shows on playback, and I'm like, fuck, you can't hear it.

01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:32.760
The chat room says you can't hear it, I can sherry shit hear it.

01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:33.760
That actually happens.

01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:36.520
Oh, it's so frustrating.

01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:41.440
If you guys look in here, if you look, you can barely see up in the corner of that shot,

01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:43.720
the ceiling is even insulated.

01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:45.440
Up there, there is sound insulation.

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:49.200
We are surrounded in sound insulation.

01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:51.920
All of the walls have that on it, all of it.

01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:58.280
And still yet, the weaponized lawn equipment is what it is, and it is the bane.

01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:00.560
I mean, boy, I can really hear that.

01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:03.520
No regard for anyone else's sound space.

01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:04.520
I think noise.

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:05.520
Yeah, go ahead.

01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:09.000
Yeah, it might be cheaper to just buy your neighbor the electric lawnmower.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.520
Yeah, I'm never convinced.

01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:14.680
Here's what it is, too, right?

01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:17.600
It's a couple of things.

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:20.360
It's the yard, the grounds, I should say, the grounds.

01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:27.240
And when I say grounds, I mean there are patches of greenish, mostly brown grass between cement,

01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:29.320
and then there are people's yards.

01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:34.000
And when I say yard, I mean something that's about seven by seven, maybe seven by six.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:39.560
I mean, they're very small yards, like not even large enough to have a gazebo in it.

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:40.560
They're small yards.

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:42.200
They're very small yards.

01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:46.820
And so what you have is a collection of tiny, small public shared spaces, which are maintained

01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:53.760
by aggressive contractors who milk this little housing community for everything.

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:59.040
And then you have these very strictly enforced yard rules, so that way everybody's tiny brown

01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:05.560
yards are up to standard, or else you get fined $60.

01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:09.060
And because nobody's on the same schedule, there's just enough people here taking care

01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:13.360
of all of their tiny little brown patches of ugly ground at different times that it

01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:16.520
seems to impact all of my shows.

01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:19.960
Even on Sundays, or I'm here on the off hours.

01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:22.440
I shouldn't get this upset about this, but it's like...

01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:25.640
60 bucks, yikes.

01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:28.640
You move into a place, and here's the thing, too.

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:32.240
Okay, so just, and then I'm done, and this is why it upsets me, and then I'm done.

01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:33.240
Two things.

01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:37.200
I would make this mistake again, because I would evaluate the yard here.

01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:38.200
You've learned nothing.

01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:40.560
And I look and I go, obviously this doesn't require maintenance.

01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:41.840
This is a great way to go.

01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:45.560
One of the reasons we are here, legitimately, is because there's such low yard maintenance.

01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:46.560
Right.

01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:47.560
Like, I'm here to podcast.

01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:48.560
It's just a studio, exactly.

01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:49.560
Yeah.

01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:50.560
Okay.

01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:51.560
So I could make the same mistake again.

01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:58.040
Number two, though, and I cannot see how I could have foreseen this, I used to live here.

01:49:58.040 --> 01:50:04.680
I lived in this house for like years, and this was never a thing.

01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:09.280
Then I moved out for like five or six years, and they got new housing authority and all

01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:10.280
of that.

01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:13.500
Like the entire community got replaced, and now this is how it's been.

01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:19.960
But I didn't know that before I came back, but this very house, I lived in it, and then

01:50:19.960 --> 01:50:20.960
I rented it out.

01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:21.960
Sounds like some Twilight Zone shit, Chris.

01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:22.960
For like five or six years.

01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:23.960
The whole community replaced.

01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:24.960
No, just the management.

01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:25.960
Now there's no very noisy.

01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:32.040
Like, at the time, not only did I know what the sound was like here, I podcasted here

01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:33.040
before.

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:36.440
So I have recorded shows in this building before, and this was not a problem in the

01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:37.440
past.

01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.120
So I did not ever consider it would be a problem.

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:42.480
You know, you come in, you invest money in a place, you get all the stuff done, you get

01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:45.680
the studio set up, and then this.

01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:47.680
Oh, man.

01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:49.200
You've been betrayed.

01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:50.680
I'm gonna check my blood.

01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:53.680
I got the watch on right here, I'm gonna check my heart rate right now to see what my heart

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:56.160
rate is before, then we're gonna start the show.

01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:59.160
Either Chris is going to the hospital or we're starting the show.

01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:00.160
We don't know which.

01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:01.160
It's difficult.

01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:02.160
No way to tell.

01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:03.160
It's difficult.

01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:07.160
Like, I can't, if I would, what I would like to be able to do, Wes, is I'd like to be able

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:10.500
to go back in time and go, this is where I made the mistake.

01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:13.480
And if dummy Chris hadn't just done this dumb thing, he wouldn't be in this problem.

01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:14.480
He would be in this situation now.

01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:16.120
Oh, dummy Chris causes you all kinds of problems.

01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:19.880
I know, past Chris is usually a D-bag, and I can figure, oh, that's where he screwed

01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:20.880
up.

01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:24.720
Like, I, well, it says I'm only 69 beats per minute, I don't know if that, how could that

01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:25.720
possibly be?

01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:27.920
I'm gonna tighten this thing up one more notch.

01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:30.760
I'll tell you what, Wes, I'll tell you what.

01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:49.360
All right, well, that's clearly not high enough, someone say something Chris hates.

01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:53.240
That was really good, Wes, that's funny.
