00:00.000 --> 00:02.880
I'm looking over my predictions before we get started,

00:02.880 --> 00:07.880
and I think my Rocky Linux prediction is just too weak.

00:08.760 --> 00:10.240
I predicted they'd ship,

00:10.240 --> 00:12.960
and I'm just disqualifying that one.

00:12.960 --> 00:14.320
Oh, I've got a good one about that.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.160
Oh, you do?

00:15.160 --> 00:15.980
Yeah.

00:15.980 --> 00:17.280
Do you want it now or later?

00:17.280 --> 00:19.200
No, no, actually, you know what?

00:19.200 --> 00:20.040
Save it for the show.

00:20.040 --> 00:30.840
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show,

00:30.840 --> 00:34.560
episode 386, one of my favorite episode numbers.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.640
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru,

00:36.640 --> 00:37.800
the leader in hands-on learning.

00:37.800 --> 00:40.400
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.240
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs,

00:42.240 --> 00:44.040
Cloud Linux servers, and much more.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.840
Get your hands cloudy at cloudguru.com.

00:46.840 --> 00:47.860
My name is Chris.

00:47.860 --> 00:49.000
My name is Wes.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.360
Hello, Wes.

00:50.360 --> 00:53.280
You brought a big crowd with you today.

00:53.280 --> 00:55.560
So right off the top here,

00:55.560 --> 00:59.520
let's welcome back to the show Joe, Alex, and Drew.

00:59.520 --> 01:00.880
Hello, gentlemen.

01:00.880 --> 01:02.520
Hello, Mike.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.080
Good to have all of you back.

01:05.260 --> 01:07.120
This has become an annual tradition now

01:07.120 --> 01:09.600
where we make our predictions and review how we've done.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.760
Sometimes we break it up into multiple episodes.

01:11.760 --> 01:14.520
This year, we're gonna try to just put it all into one show.

01:14.520 --> 01:16.080
See, just get it done.

01:16.080 --> 01:19.240
This is the last production of 2020.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.440
Thank goodness.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.920
And to help us celebrate and throw in a few predictions

01:22.920 --> 01:24.840
of their own, it is our virtual lug.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.720
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.120
Good morning, Mumble Room.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.680
Okay, okay.

01:31.680 --> 01:35.360
That's a big crowd in there and a lot of energy in there.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.200
You know, it's that pre-show.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.720
We get them all warmed up with the pre-show.

01:37.720 --> 01:39.520
Carl, I see you just snuck in under the radar there.

01:39.520 --> 01:40.360
Hello, Carl.

01:40.360 --> 01:41.180
Good to have you back.

01:41.180 --> 01:42.020
Howdy, howdy.

01:42.020 --> 01:43.440
And Palby, good to have you back too, sir.

01:43.440 --> 01:44.400
Hello, hello.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.320
Greetings.

01:45.320 --> 01:48.320
Now, I wanna hear all of your predictions here in a bit,

01:48.320 --> 01:50.240
so get thinking.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.440
And I think you have the luxury

01:52.440 --> 01:55.600
of not being held accountable for your predictions.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.400
We do write them down, right, Ben?

01:57.400 --> 01:59.120
You're gonna write these ones down, right?

01:59.120 --> 02:00.440
Yeah, a little bit.

02:00.440 --> 02:01.400
I'm counting on you.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.080
There will be a document with your prediction written down,

02:04.080 --> 02:05.800
but we won't play it back and shame you for it

02:05.800 --> 02:08.040
like we're gonna do ours.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.220
So let's get right to it,

02:09.220 --> 02:11.340
because I wanna just do this in a couple of pieces.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.880
We'll start with the reviews,

02:12.880 --> 02:14.160
and then we'll do the predictions.

02:14.160 --> 02:17.680
And just like last year, Joe is here to play a judge,

02:17.680 --> 02:22.120
jury, and coach, I guess, ref.

02:22.120 --> 02:24.400
Joe, are you ready to get started with the reviews?

02:24.400 --> 02:25.660
Should we start with Alex?

02:25.660 --> 02:26.600
Yeah, let's do it.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.280
Oh, I don't know if I'm ready for that.

02:28.280 --> 02:29.920
I know, but let's just get, it's like a band-aid.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.360
We're just gonna rip it off, okay?

02:31.360 --> 02:32.200
Okay. All right.

02:32.200 --> 02:35.700
So you made a prediction about hard drive sizes.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.320
There will be a three and a half inch hard drive

02:38.320 --> 02:42.640
available to consumers of at least 20 terabytes in capacity.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.840
Now, I don't know if that's actually happened, Alex.

02:44.840 --> 02:45.760
Ding, ding.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.640
There's 24 terabytes hard drives now.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.720
Oh, no kidding!

02:50.720 --> 02:52.400
Really? Do you have a link for that?

02:52.400 --> 02:55.000
Can we verify that for the judge really quick?

02:55.000 --> 02:55.840
We may have a winner.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.880
He has strict standards, that judge.

02:59.740 --> 03:00.720
That's great, Alex.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.960
I think, oh, we're starting off with a winner.

03:02.960 --> 03:04.000
That's fantastic.

03:04.000 --> 03:04.840
I love it.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.280
At 100 terabytes,

03:10.280 --> 03:12.380
it's the largest solid state drive right now,

03:12.380 --> 03:16.080
the Nimbus Data ExaDrive, 100 terabytes.

03:16.080 --> 03:18.600
Wow. Can you actually buy that though?

03:18.600 --> 03:21.920
In September, they said it would be here by Christmas.

03:21.920 --> 03:22.840
Any idea on the price,

03:22.840 --> 03:25.480
or is it like not actually listed yet?

03:25.480 --> 03:26.320
100 terabytes.

03:26.320 --> 03:29.220
I mean, imagine essentially your entire storage capacity,

03:29.220 --> 03:31.160
Alex, in one disk.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.060
Yeah.

03:32.060 --> 03:34.180
That would really be something.

03:34.180 --> 03:36.300
So yeah, I guess you definitely got that one right.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.240
We're giving that one to you.

03:37.240 --> 03:39.520
Imagine the RAID rebuild times on that mother.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.360
Jeez.

03:40.360 --> 03:42.160
And the trickery they're pulling off,

03:42.160 --> 03:43.360
I'm sure just to get that possible.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.400
Okay, Alex, two more for you.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.720
The next one has a good shot too.

03:46.720 --> 03:48.840
You made a prediction about Jellyfin.

03:48.840 --> 03:52.600
I predict that MB or Jellyfin or Olaris

03:52.600 --> 03:55.000
will become a viable alternative to Plex

03:55.000 --> 03:59.600
by shipping apps on one of the major platforms

03:59.600 --> 04:03.320
such as Roku, Android TV, or Apple TV.

04:03.320 --> 04:06.280
Okay, a Jellyfin app on Roku or Android TV.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.000
I think that exists, but I'm not positive.

04:08.000 --> 04:08.960
Does anybody?

04:08.960 --> 04:10.480
I mean, you can find Jellyfin

04:10.480 --> 04:12.200
over in the Roku store, it looks like.

04:12.200 --> 04:15.360
There's Jellyfin for Android TV and Google Play.

04:15.360 --> 04:16.520
Alex.

04:16.520 --> 04:18.320
Two for two, hell yeah.

04:18.320 --> 04:21.040
I mean, see, you thought it was gonna be rough, man,

04:21.040 --> 04:21.860
but I'm saying.

04:21.860 --> 04:27.280
Can I be the referee on that terrible sound

04:27.280 --> 04:28.880
and say, please don't play that, Chris?

04:28.880 --> 04:29.840
Yeah, I don't like that.

04:29.840 --> 04:30.680
I don't like that.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.320
I hate it too.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.160
I just found it.

04:33.160 --> 04:34.800
You missed your sound swap.

04:34.800 --> 04:38.080
All right, Alex, your last prediction.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.720
Let's see what you said about WireGuard.

04:40.720 --> 04:44.520
So I predict that Ubuntu LTS 2004

04:44.520 --> 04:48.640
will ship with WireGuard, not as a DKMS module,

04:48.640 --> 04:52.120
and also as a second, like half prediction,

04:52.120 --> 04:55.280
that PF Sense will ship with WireGuard.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.760
Okay, I think the Ubuntu part's right,

04:56.760 --> 04:58.920
although we may have known at that point.

04:58.920 --> 04:59.760
Do you know, Ref?

04:59.760 --> 05:02.640
Do you know when we found out that that was gonna happen,

05:02.640 --> 05:05.240
or Poppy, maybe you might know when that decision was made?

05:05.240 --> 05:07.000
I'm pretty sure we knew at that point.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.120
No, we definitely didn't.

05:08.120 --> 05:11.320
I wouldn't have been so callous

05:11.320 --> 05:13.080
and predicted something I already knew.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.840
So what about the PF Sense part?

05:14.840 --> 05:16.520
Also, do we have any, can we check on that?

05:16.520 --> 05:20.200
No, so PF Sense is still just a plugin.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.520
In fact, I don't even know if it,

05:21.520 --> 05:24.120
because I've switched to OpenSense now,

05:24.120 --> 05:26.180
because of WireGuard support, so.

05:26.180 --> 05:29.120
It was right on the line last December, right?

05:29.120 --> 05:31.240
It had been pulled into the NetDev tree,

05:31.240 --> 05:33.920
but not actually into Linus's tree around this time?

05:33.920 --> 05:37.600
But the Ubuntu one was definitely not certain

05:37.600 --> 05:39.400
until 2004 shipped.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.800
Yeah, I think I'm gonna give it to you.

05:40.800 --> 05:41.800
I'm gonna give it to you, I think.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.600
I mean, Ref, you can talk me out of it.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.640
I don't have to warm the point,

05:44.640 --> 05:45.580
because you get the call.

05:45.580 --> 05:46.920
I don't mean to overstep,

05:46.920 --> 05:49.640
but I actually, I'm thinking about it,

05:49.640 --> 05:51.120
and I don't know that we knew for certain

05:51.120 --> 05:52.480
it wouldn't be like DKMS,

05:52.480 --> 05:54.240
or it wouldn't be some sort of weird.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.880
If I recall correctly, it was very much targeted

05:56.880 --> 05:59.400
at that point, but it hadn't been 100% decided,

05:59.400 --> 06:01.300
so it was a bit of an easy prediction,

06:01.300 --> 06:02.680
but I think we have to give it to him.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.800
All right, good job, Alex.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.400
Jeez, that's all three for you, Alex.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.320
You got three, yeah.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.000
Jeez, you really, now the pressure's on.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.640
You really better not disappoint this year.

06:11.640 --> 06:16.360
Do I get a prize, by the way, for getting all three right?

06:16.360 --> 06:17.600
Yeah, but you gotta come to Washington

06:17.600 --> 06:18.520
to get it, unfortunately.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.000
Or you've got a 3D printed for yourself.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.640
Yeah, oh yeah.

06:21.640 --> 06:22.480
Thanks, Joe.

06:22.480 --> 06:25.380
All right, I think I'll hold mine.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.400
I think I'll hold mine.

06:27.400 --> 06:30.220
I'll do mine next, but let's do Wes,

06:30.220 --> 06:32.040
because I've got Wes, you queue it up next here.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.040
I guess we're not doing alphabetical anymore.

06:34.040 --> 06:36.260
Oh boy, Wes, I really wish this one came true.

06:36.260 --> 06:38.880
You made a prediction about BcashFS.

06:38.880 --> 06:42.560
I predict that in 2020, BcashFS makes it

06:42.560 --> 06:44.280
into the Linux kernel mainline.

06:44.280 --> 06:45.940
Ah, man.

06:45.940 --> 06:48.800
No luck for me there, or for any of the rest of us.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.520
Ironically, I just made that my prediction

06:50.520 --> 06:51.440
on Linux Action News.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.440
We have another set of maybe more professional picks

06:54.440 --> 06:56.440
on Linux Action News, or predictions, I should say,

06:56.440 --> 06:58.520
and that was one of mine, hint, hint.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.160
Yeah, I feel a little bolstered by that.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.280
You know, like it's not unreasonable,

07:01.280 --> 07:03.660
but at the same time, I'm sort of happy to see things

07:03.660 --> 07:06.040
continuing to develop nicely,

07:06.040 --> 07:07.720
but you know, with still a few rough edges

07:07.720 --> 07:09.080
and not getting rushed.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.760
I'd like it to be a file system I trust

07:10.760 --> 07:12.900
once it's ready and in the kernel.

07:12.900 --> 07:16.080
I want to give some latitude to the ref

07:16.080 --> 07:17.520
on this next prediction,

07:17.520 --> 07:20.860
because I think it's kind of like half and half.

07:20.860 --> 07:23.400
It was about me and what distro and desktop environment

07:23.400 --> 07:25.220
I would be using at this point.

07:25.220 --> 07:28.440
I predict that by the next predictions episode,

07:28.440 --> 07:31.600
you, my friend, will be on Manjaro.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.780
Now, I think you also, but in the less shortened version,

07:34.780 --> 07:36.760
said I'd probably be on Plasma too, if I recall.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.640
I did predict you'd be on Plasma.

07:38.640 --> 07:42.720
Yeah, but that wasn't, but what was in the locked version

07:42.720 --> 07:47.440
is Manjaro, and while I have Manjaro on a device,

07:47.440 --> 07:52.280
I'm actually on a mix, I'm on a mix of Fedora and Arch,

07:52.280 --> 07:55.660
or I guess you could say Endeavor OS.

07:55.660 --> 07:56.500
Does that count?

07:56.500 --> 07:57.820
No, that doesn't count as Manjaro.

07:57.820 --> 08:00.560
What's on your upstairs desktop in your office

08:00.560 --> 08:01.800
and what's on your laptop?

08:01.800 --> 08:03.360
I think it's got to be one of those two.

08:03.360 --> 08:06.480
So the laptop's Fedora, and then the desktop upstairs

08:06.480 --> 08:09.440
is Endeavor OS, or Arch.

08:09.440 --> 08:10.520
That was close though, Wes.

08:10.520 --> 08:13.420
Yeah, I think I was in the right vein of things

08:13.420 --> 08:17.160
in that I didn't think Endeavor OS would be where it is today

08:17.160 --> 08:19.240
and really be an option, so I think Manjaro was like,

08:19.240 --> 08:21.160
that's the Arch that Chris would actually use,

08:21.160 --> 08:23.880
and it turns out there's a slightly closer to Arch

08:23.880 --> 08:26.320
version of that, and okay, that makes sense.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.120
And I think the part that didn't make it in the locked-in

08:28.120 --> 08:30.040
prediction, because just for the rules for those

08:30.040 --> 08:32.340
that haven't listened to the previous one,

08:32.340 --> 08:33.680
we have to lock in the predictions,

08:33.680 --> 08:34.840
so when we get to our predictions,

08:34.840 --> 08:36.520
we're gonna work them out as a group,

08:36.520 --> 08:38.960
and then we decide on a locked-in version,

08:38.960 --> 08:42.040
we make it nice and concise, and then we lock that in.

08:42.040 --> 08:44.400
And in our conversations, Wes, what I recall

08:44.400 --> 08:46.040
was that you were doing the plasma math,

08:46.040 --> 08:48.120
and you were saying, I think you're gonna be on plasma,

08:48.120 --> 08:49.180
and if you're gonna be on plasma,

08:49.180 --> 08:50.400
you're probably gonna be on an Arch,

08:50.400 --> 08:52.300
and at that point in time, it was just,

08:52.300 --> 08:54.800
it was really likely gonna be Manjaro.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.520
The curveball is, is I didn't appreciate the fact

08:57.520 --> 09:02.400
that the fedora spin of plasma has very frequent

09:02.400 --> 09:05.120
KDE neon-style plasma updates.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.500
It's, you know, you're really, you're getting

09:06.500 --> 09:08.660
fresh plasma in there, and that was the part

09:08.660 --> 09:11.040
that was kind of unknown to us back then

09:11.040 --> 09:13.240
that I only discovered, you know, a few weeks ago

09:13.240 --> 09:14.160
when Neil told me.

09:14.160 --> 09:17.800
So there's that, and I think that threw you

09:17.800 --> 09:19.320
a curveball in the whole thing.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.160
Hmm, so you're saying maybe there's a new prediction

09:21.160 --> 09:22.360
for next year buried in here.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.600
You probably ought to give us, you could give a stab at it,

09:24.600 --> 09:25.440
you never know.

09:26.680 --> 09:29.000
I'm not gonna reveal, though, which one I think it is.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.240
All right, you got one more, Wes,

09:30.240 --> 09:32.440
and it was about Google Stadia.

09:32.440 --> 09:33.600
It doesn't make me happy to say,

09:33.600 --> 09:36.280
but I predict that by the end of 2020,

09:36.280 --> 09:39.440
Google will have announced the sunsetting of Stadia.

09:39.440 --> 09:40.640
Gladly not.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.360
Yeah, yeah, so I didn't realize they were in year two

09:43.360 --> 09:47.000
of this thing, but I guess we're entering year two of Stadia.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.200
I wonder, too, it seems like it's, you know,

09:49.200 --> 09:51.800
it definitely felt kind of stagnant, not a lot of news,

09:51.800 --> 09:54.000
but it being one of the better places

09:54.000 --> 09:56.560
to play Cyberpunk, I think has bolstered it a little bit,

09:56.560 --> 09:58.640
at least in the past, you know, couple weeks.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.480
True.

09:59.480 --> 10:00.960
That and the fact they gave it away for free

10:00.960 --> 10:02.320
whenever you bought a Chromecast

10:02.320 --> 10:03.720
and stuff like that for a while.

10:03.720 --> 10:04.560
Yes.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.280
And during COVID, it was free for like two months.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.400
Yeah, yeah.

10:08.400 --> 10:12.480
I think the whole COVID and the lockdown has boosted a lot.

10:12.480 --> 10:16.280
Yeah, and honestly, there was just no way

10:16.280 --> 10:19.000
I was gonna upgrade my PC to play Cyberpunk.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.240
I just won't get the return

10:20.240 --> 10:21.960
on that kind of investment right now,

10:21.960 --> 10:24.040
and I just was not gonna consider it.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.320
But when I realized it was on Stadia,

10:26.320 --> 10:29.040
and I had like some sort of founder's credit or something,

10:29.040 --> 10:31.720
so I basically got it for a super cheap price,

10:31.720 --> 10:33.760
and I was like, okay, well, that'll do.

10:33.760 --> 10:37.240
And I still wish to this day that if I buy a game on Stadia,

10:37.240 --> 10:38.960
it came with some sort of Steam redemption code

10:38.960 --> 10:41.760
or some other platform,

10:41.760 --> 10:43.400
because if I'm paying full price,

10:43.400 --> 10:45.920
it really makes me tap the brakes before I use Stadia,

10:45.920 --> 10:48.720
because just like Wes, I did in 2020,

10:48.720 --> 10:50.440
I think you could predict this year they spin it down.

10:50.440 --> 10:51.880
It's still not a guaranteed lock for me,

10:51.880 --> 10:52.960
because it's Google,

10:52.960 --> 10:56.560
and I don't feel comfortable spending full retail price

10:56.560 --> 10:58.120
for a game that's in Stadia.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.280
But if I can get discounts here and there from Google,

11:00.280 --> 11:01.360
I've taken action on them,

11:01.360 --> 11:04.080
and as a result, I've got Red Dead Redemption in there,

11:04.080 --> 11:06.040
I've got a couple of freebie games that they gave out,

11:06.040 --> 11:08.640
and I've got Cyberpunk 2077.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.800
And I know people aren't gonna believe it,

11:10.800 --> 11:12.120
but I have to tell you,

11:12.120 --> 11:14.720
I sit here in the studio at this very computer,

11:14.720 --> 11:17.080
which is not a really nice computer anymore,

11:17.080 --> 11:18.880
and I play Cyberpunk on the live stream,

11:18.880 --> 11:20.520
and I live stream playing Cyberpunk

11:20.520 --> 11:22.960
with graphics that I think look great,

11:22.960 --> 11:25.400
and I have zero issues with latency,

11:25.400 --> 11:26.440
with how it plays at all,

11:26.440 --> 11:28.240
and I'm not on a fantastic connection,

11:28.240 --> 11:31.920
I'm on a fast for Comcast connection.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.920
And it's real,

11:33.920 --> 11:34.920
and it means I can sit here

11:34.920 --> 11:37.200
and do it with free open source drivers.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.320
You just don't have to worry about it, right?

11:38.320 --> 11:40.200
It's just another service that you have access to.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.640
You can pop on, play some games,

11:41.640 --> 11:44.080
and then go back to editing things in nano,

11:44.080 --> 11:46.000
if that's what you wanna do.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.320
Okay, so I just came across Drew's prediction,

11:48.320 --> 11:49.240
and it threw me for a loop,

11:49.240 --> 11:52.680
because it was a Drew prediction via Brent,

11:52.680 --> 11:54.000
because Drew couldn't make it.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.800
That's not fair, everyone likes Brent.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.480
I feel like I should get all my predictions read

11:57.480 --> 11:59.960
in Brent's voice, just to have a better shot at winning.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.120
Yeah, hold on here.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.200
That's a great point.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.440
I didn't know having Brent read stuff for us

12:05.440 --> 12:06.400
was even an option.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.720
I would like to take advantage of that too.

12:08.720 --> 12:09.880
Me too, sign me up.

12:11.520 --> 12:12.660
Brent is a service.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.480
All right, brace yourself, Drew.

12:16.480 --> 12:19.640
You made a prediction about home assistants

12:19.640 --> 12:23.560
like the Alexa and Google Assistant,

12:23.560 --> 12:25.560
and it goes a little bit like this.

12:25.560 --> 12:28.800
I believe in 2020,

12:28.800 --> 12:32.680
we will see one of the voice assistant platforms,

12:32.680 --> 12:34.680
one of the Pepsi or Cola,

12:34.680 --> 12:39.680
get a malicious exploit that is active in the wild.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.160
It's a little vague, Ref.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.400
I don't know, but what are you thinking on this one?

12:43.400 --> 12:45.680
I don't think that I've seen one.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.160
I haven't read about one, so.

12:47.160 --> 12:50.800
There was one in August of 2020,

12:50.800 --> 12:53.800
but it wasn't named, it wasn't huge news.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.440
So I don't know, I don't know if I would count it.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.440
Okay, so there's actually been two different ones

12:59.440 --> 13:02.720
because I followed InfoSec fairly closely.

13:02.720 --> 13:06.840
One allowed people to install applications

13:06.840 --> 13:11.040
bypassing your install account stuff.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.840
The other one actually allowed someone

13:13.840 --> 13:18.160
to put a malicious app on the Amazon Alexa

13:18.160 --> 13:20.720
and turn on the microphone remotely.

13:20.720 --> 13:23.040
It actually got a CVE, if I remember correctly.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.760
If you got a CVE, then you get the point.

13:24.760 --> 13:25.760
Right, right.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.640
Yeah, boy, it'd be great to find links for that,

13:27.640 --> 13:29.960
but that actually does sound like you might've got it, Ref.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.400
Yeah, I would say so.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.220
Woo-hoo!

13:32.220 --> 13:33.060
Nice job, Drew.

13:33.060 --> 13:37.320
I mean, I think that was one of the more kind of,

13:37.320 --> 13:41.000
I'm not gonna say risky picks, but more out there ones

13:41.000 --> 13:43.280
just because it was even kind of debatable right now

13:43.280 --> 13:45.080
what happened, but if it's got a CVE, I say,

13:45.080 --> 13:45.920
there it is right there.

13:45.920 --> 13:46.880
Boom, Popeye has it.

13:46.880 --> 13:47.720
Hey.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.840
Yeah, ha-ha.

13:49.840 --> 13:50.680
Good job, Drew.

13:50.680 --> 13:51.520
You only got the one via Brent,

13:51.520 --> 13:53.440
so unlike the traditional three, you just had that one.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.360
But you can come up with up to three today if you'd like,

13:55.360 --> 13:56.420
but start ruminating now

13:56.420 --> 13:58.800
because it's gonna be timed shortly.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.080
But first, let's get to my three and see how I did.

14:02.080 --> 14:05.680
And I remember feeling like some of these were a long shot.

14:05.680 --> 14:09.060
So we start with my prediction about Home Assistant,

14:09.060 --> 14:10.540
which I actually didn't know made it into the show,

14:10.540 --> 14:11.840
but I guess I locked it in.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.120
In 2020, we will see the introduction

14:15.120 --> 14:16.320
of a Home Assistant box,

14:16.320 --> 14:19.680
either by the project directly or a third party bundler

14:19.680 --> 14:23.080
that creates a Home Assistant appliance.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.160
And this just recently happened.

14:25.160 --> 14:26.360
The Home Assistant Blue.

14:26.360 --> 14:29.160
I can't believe the timing on that, Chris.

14:29.160 --> 14:32.120
Yeah, in fact, not only did they announce it, Alex,

14:32.120 --> 14:35.920
but a few people have started receiving their units in 2020.

14:35.920 --> 14:38.240
The Home Assistant Blue, yeah, good job.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.720
It's based around the Odroid N2 Plus, I think.

14:41.720 --> 14:44.160
Oh, I'm really, I don't remember making that prediction.

14:44.160 --> 14:47.520
So I was totally surprised when they did it,

14:47.520 --> 14:50.040
which is funny because usually my predictions,

14:50.040 --> 14:52.220
like I hold onto them all year waiting for them to happen,

14:52.220 --> 14:53.840
but this year I just threw it out in the universe

14:53.840 --> 14:55.400
and let it go and look what happened.

14:55.400 --> 14:58.040
All right, right, so Ref, if you agree, that's a winner?

14:58.040 --> 14:58.880
Yep.

14:58.880 --> 15:01.480
Okay, my next, oh, this doesn't look good.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.720
My next prediction was about Plasma and Chrome OS.

15:04.720 --> 15:08.160
I predict in 2020 that by some means,

15:08.160 --> 15:11.120
it will be possible to run Plasma Shell

15:11.120 --> 15:14.140
on top of Chrome OS before the end of the year.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.640
I mean, it seems like it should have happened

15:16.640 --> 15:18.920
with all the Linux stuff they were doing and running apps,

15:18.920 --> 15:19.760
but as far as I know,

15:19.760 --> 15:21.400
you can't actually get all Plasma Shell up

15:21.400 --> 15:23.160
on Chrome OS still.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.360
Damn shame.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.280
That should have happened.

15:26.280 --> 15:27.640
I think that's a loser, Ref.

15:27.640 --> 15:28.520
Yeah, I think so,

15:28.520 --> 15:30.160
because I would have noticed that

15:30.160 --> 15:31.720
if it had happened this year,

15:31.720 --> 15:34.200
but unless it's on some obscure forum somewhere,

15:34.200 --> 15:35.840
no, don't think you get the point.

15:35.840 --> 15:40.840
Maybe it's possible, maybe via container,

15:43.240 --> 15:44.080
but I don't think so.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.000
I know some people run KD Neon in Docker,

15:46.000 --> 15:47.840
but I don't think so.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.200
I'm not gonna try to fight that.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.720
All right, this one also looks like

15:50.720 --> 15:51.920
it's another loser for me.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.720
I made a prediction about Ubuntu deploying Wayland.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.440
I predict in 2020 that Canonical

15:57.440 --> 16:00.520
will switch the Ubuntu release over to Wayland

16:00.520 --> 16:03.880
in their 2010 release.

16:03.880 --> 16:08.160
That also, it definitely did not happen.

16:11.480 --> 16:15.160
Although I have installed Wayland on Ubuntu 2010,

16:15.160 --> 16:16.080
and that works just fine.

16:16.080 --> 16:17.640
Well, look at you.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.000
Yeah, unfortunately,

16:19.000 --> 16:20.880
Poppy, what do you think the chances are

16:20.880 --> 16:22.280
that there'll be another shot at it

16:22.280 --> 16:24.440
before the next LTS, like the release before?

16:24.440 --> 16:25.960
You can't ask something like that

16:25.960 --> 16:28.920
right before the prediction segment.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.680
Oh, ah, okay.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.680
All right, fair enough, fair enough, fair enough.

16:32.680 --> 16:34.480
Let me just quickly write down a prediction.

16:34.480 --> 16:35.320
Yeah.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.640
I think I clearly got that one wrong, Raph.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.160
I don't think there's any arguing that.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.000
Yeah.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.520
All right, then one last prediction,

16:42.520 --> 16:43.360
and that was from you,

16:43.360 --> 16:45.600
and I only have one for you here, Joe.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.840
So here we go.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.760
All right, well, I'll give you an absolutely crazy one.

16:48.760 --> 16:51.240
Chrome OS will add ZFS support.

16:51.240 --> 16:53.640
Ah, I'm gonna say a big no on that one there, Joe.

16:57.640 --> 17:00.600
Yeah, no ZFS support on Chrome OS.

17:00.600 --> 17:04.160
They did get ButterFS support, but no ZFS support.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.760
Yeah, that was just me being as ridiculous as possible

17:06.760 --> 17:07.880
at the end of the episode.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.240
Yeah, fair enough.

17:10.240 --> 17:11.560
Well, you don't get that free

17:11.560 --> 17:13.720
or meaningless internet point anyways.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.920
All right, so there we go.

17:15.920 --> 17:19.200
I gotta say, Alex, I think you clearly did the best.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.880
I mean, I guess Drew got all of his right too,

17:20.880 --> 17:22.560
but that's because he only did one.

17:22.560 --> 17:25.120
We both got 100%, Drew, good job.

17:25.120 --> 17:30.120
Now, to be fair, I did submit like four or five,

17:30.120 --> 17:32.400
but only one of them got read, so.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.840
Oh, hmm.

17:34.840 --> 17:37.720
Sounds like there is probably a case for you

17:37.720 --> 17:41.080
to file with the Brent as a service company.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.120
Yeah, I'll submit a ticket on that, yeah.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.040
What we need to do is pay for the pro Slack,

17:45.040 --> 17:47.120
and then we can scroll back and see what they were.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.120
Right, yeah, that's probably it.

17:49.120 --> 17:50.360
That's how we'll do it.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.360
I will unlock it.

17:52.440 --> 17:53.440
Good job, Alex.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.160
But yeah, I think my only solace in all of this

17:56.160 --> 17:57.920
is I beat Wes by one.

17:57.920 --> 18:00.920
Ugh.

18:00.920 --> 18:03.720
All right, come on, lucky 2021.

18:03.720 --> 18:04.720
Yeah, right?

18:04.720 --> 18:06.440
I mean, it was a rough year for a lot of reasons,

18:06.440 --> 18:09.640
not just the predictions, Wes, not just the predictions.

18:09.640 --> 18:11.440
But all right, so speaking of those,

18:11.440 --> 18:13.800
we will do that in just a moment.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.480
I wanna thank everybody who's joined us live.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.720
You know, the Unplugged program will be live

18:17.720 --> 18:20.200
for you to come and hang out all in 2021.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.120
It's a whole new fresh year.

18:21.120 --> 18:24.520
Why not do a whole fresh new stream over at jblive.tv.

18:24.520 --> 18:29.120
Linode.com slash Unplugged.

18:29.120 --> 18:32.240
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards a new account

18:32.240 --> 18:34.040
and go there to support the show.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.560
Linode is our cloud server provider.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.640
And because the price is so great, you can try them out

18:38.640 --> 18:40.640
and you can get a machine starting at $5 a month

18:40.640 --> 18:42.040
or with that $100 credit,

18:42.040 --> 18:44.160
you can try something pretty powerful.

18:44.160 --> 18:47.920
We spin up rigs as just test machines from time to time.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.120
Alex has a brand new fancy website

18:50.120 --> 18:52.600
that he'll be talking about soon on the self-hosted podcast.

18:52.600 --> 18:53.960
I don't wanna spoil it, Alex,

18:53.960 --> 18:57.360
but he's hosting the entire thing on Linode.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.720
Listener Jeff wrote in to tell us about

18:59.720 --> 19:02.880
how he did a test migration using Nextcloud.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.600
That he planned it all out

19:04.600 --> 19:06.440
and he spun up some Tesla nodes.

19:06.440 --> 19:07.400
He did the whole thing,

19:07.400 --> 19:09.280
read through all their documentation

19:09.280 --> 19:10.920
and then he did it in production.

19:10.920 --> 19:13.600
And he actually discovered that their cheapest rig

19:13.600 --> 19:16.440
was more powerful than his local quad core machine.

19:17.280 --> 19:20.200
And that's, it's a great story of like learning

19:20.200 --> 19:23.240
and deploying and just using the resources available

19:23.240 --> 19:25.200
at Linode to do all of that.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.440
And what I love about them

19:26.440 --> 19:28.240
is their passion for Linux and open source.

19:28.240 --> 19:31.680
That's what got them in this business in the first place.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.240
Probably a lot like yourself,

19:34.240 --> 19:37.360
they saw where technology was gonna be really useful.

19:37.360 --> 19:38.840
They saw where something was going

19:38.840 --> 19:41.760
and realized, man, that's gonna change the game.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.360
That's what got them fired up about starting up Linode.

19:44.360 --> 19:47.200
And that's why they started three years before AWS

19:47.200 --> 19:49.240
because they were doing this

19:49.240 --> 19:51.320
from an independent passion standpoint,

19:51.320 --> 19:52.840
not from some bureaucratic,

19:52.840 --> 19:56.440
how can we leverage infrastructure and make money?

19:56.440 --> 19:57.880
And what they ended up doing over time

19:57.880 --> 20:00.200
was building one of the greatest and largest

20:00.200 --> 20:03.800
independent and independently owned cloud companies.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.320
Now with 11 data centers all over the world,

20:06.320 --> 20:10.240
super fast SSDs, 40 gigabit connections to the hypervisors,

20:10.240 --> 20:13.760
machines with multiple GPUs, dedicated CPU cores

20:13.760 --> 20:16.560
and of course then things like object storage

20:16.560 --> 20:19.600
and block storage and load balancing

20:19.600 --> 20:22.920
all of these really fancy back end features

20:22.920 --> 20:24.000
that you can take advantage

20:24.000 --> 20:26.400
through infrastructure management tools

20:26.400 --> 20:29.120
or just by getting down on the command line yourself.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.040
They're dedicated to offering

20:30.040 --> 20:31.720
the best virtualized cloud computing.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.360
If it runs on Linux, it'll run on Linode.

20:34.360 --> 20:37.920
So just get started at linode.com slash unplugged.

20:37.920 --> 20:41.120
Go there, get a $100 60 day credit towards a new account

20:41.120 --> 20:44.880
and go there to support the show, linode.com slash unplugged.

20:44.880 --> 20:48.960
All right, gentlemen, it is time to get into the 2021 predictions.

20:48.960 --> 20:52.400
And I think we will start around,

20:52.400 --> 20:53.720
I think we'll just use the same route again.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.080
Alex, if you're comfortable kicking off with your predictions,

20:56.080 --> 20:57.120
we'll start with you, sir.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.360
Oh, come on.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.200
Can we do reverse alphabetical order or something

21:00.200 --> 21:02.120
so I can steal someone else's?

21:02.120 --> 21:02.960
No, all right.

21:02.960 --> 21:05.000
Here's what, you know what we'll do is I'll start, okay?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.600
So that'll make it, that'll, we'll just sort of set

21:07.600 --> 21:09.960
then we'll just go around, everybody will do one.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.320
And now remember the format is you have to set

21:12.320 --> 21:15.440
this is so hilarious, you have to make your grand prediction.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.240
Then everybody can kind of chime in.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.400
The ref is gonna make sure everything kind of lines up

21:19.400 --> 21:20.720
and is actually accountable.

21:20.720 --> 21:24.840
And then we have you repeat it in a lockable, precise version.

21:24.840 --> 21:26.640
And that is what will be held account.

21:26.640 --> 21:27.880
Not the math that got you there,

21:27.880 --> 21:29.880
but the actual locked in version.

21:29.880 --> 21:33.280
And I'm gonna start with mine.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.480
I think this is a long shot,

21:35.480 --> 21:37.920
but I feel like having a little bit of fun.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.880
I think it's gonna be a little bit of fun.

21:40.880 --> 21:44.040
I think our friends over at System76

21:44.040 --> 21:48.120
are gonna look very heavily at forking GNOME to some degree.

21:48.120 --> 21:51.280
And I don't know if fork is too heavy of a word here,

21:51.280 --> 21:55.000
but I think when you look at the direction of GNOME Shell 40

21:55.000 --> 21:57.720
and some of the UI fundamental changes there

21:57.720 --> 22:01.600
and how Pop!OS is kind of acting as a layer

22:01.600 --> 22:04.960
between Upstream and System76's customers,

22:04.960 --> 22:06.680
I think they're gonna find this in their best interest

22:06.680 --> 22:10.560
to kind of take the endless OS type approach.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.000
Where they don't stay forked forever,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.240
but they kind of go off in their own direction.

22:15.240 --> 22:18.160
They build there, and then they contribute back Upstream

22:18.160 --> 22:20.080
and what gets accepted makes it in,

22:20.080 --> 22:22.640
and everybody benefits.

22:22.640 --> 22:26.400
But that's going to be some sort of transition

22:26.400 --> 22:29.400
that System76 makes in 2021.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.880
I don't know how you're going to boil that down

22:31.880 --> 22:34.440
into something that you can say concisely.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.280
What counts as a fork? What's different enough?

22:37.280 --> 22:39.760
It can't just be on GitHub, right?

22:39.760 --> 22:42.680
That's what I think if we can come to an agreement on a fork,

22:42.680 --> 22:47.080
then I think the lock-in is that System76 forks GNOME.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.920
But I think the fork here has to be...

22:48.920 --> 22:53.240
And I don't really know how to articulate how endless does it.

22:53.240 --> 22:55.920
But what I roughly understand about endless

22:55.920 --> 22:58.720
is they essentially stabilize on a version of GNOME Shell.

22:58.720 --> 23:00.760
They build on top of that for a while.

23:00.760 --> 23:03.520
So essentially a few releases pass them by

23:03.520 --> 23:05.200
and they pass along what they've done Upstream,

23:05.200 --> 23:08.320
and then they kind of like re-snapshot

23:08.320 --> 23:10.680
off of, say, GNOME Shell 3.3.8.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.800
They'll build off of that for a while,

23:12.800 --> 23:15.560
maybe GNOME 40 and GNOME 41 even ships,

23:15.560 --> 23:18.000
then they kind of rebase again off of that

23:18.000 --> 23:19.400
and kind of move forward,

23:19.400 --> 23:22.520
and all while sending the work they do Upstream

23:22.520 --> 23:24.000
to the core project.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.200
That's not exactly what they do.

23:26.200 --> 23:31.120
Actually, endless does far less Upstreaming of their changes

23:31.120 --> 23:34.440
to GNOME Shell and other GNOME components than you would expect,

23:34.440 --> 23:37.880
because they retool the UI significantly,

23:37.880 --> 23:40.040
and a lot of the underlying frameworks

23:40.040 --> 23:42.240
for their particular purpose.

23:42.240 --> 23:45.080
And as part of that, it's...

23:45.080 --> 23:47.520
You can think of it closer to the process

23:47.520 --> 23:50.520
that eventually led to the Unity desktop existing

23:50.520 --> 23:54.480
than the process that would lead to improving

23:54.480 --> 23:56.280
the GNOME code base itself.

23:56.280 --> 23:59.160
Wouldn't that actually be kind of almost poetically perfect

23:59.160 --> 24:01.440
in a sense because it was the death of Unity

24:01.440 --> 24:05.360
that compelled System76 to launch BOP!OS?

24:05.360 --> 24:06.720
Okay, Rev, how about this?

24:06.720 --> 24:11.560
System76 forks GNOME Shell in the same spirit

24:11.560 --> 24:13.560
that EndlessOS does.

24:13.560 --> 24:15.720
I think that's probably about as precise

24:15.720 --> 24:17.000
as we can get with this.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.360
We'll just have to have a fun debate and discussion

24:19.360 --> 24:22.680
next year around this time when we decide if it happened.

24:22.680 --> 24:24.760
Well, because the reality is it's probably not going to look

24:24.760 --> 24:26.280
exactly like what's been done before.

24:26.280 --> 24:27.920
So I can't just point to a specific thing

24:27.920 --> 24:30.360
and say it's going to be just like that is what I suspect.

24:30.360 --> 24:34.600
I do think that you're right that there will be a sort of a line

24:34.600 --> 24:36.480
in the sand of like, was this a significant change?

24:36.480 --> 24:37.920
Did it cause some development friction?

24:37.920 --> 24:40.360
Did it represent significant work from System76

24:40.360 --> 24:42.800
to make this change or to make the process different?

24:42.800 --> 24:45.040
And we'll have a sense of that next year.

24:45.040 --> 24:47.800
Well, you could just look at where the GNOME Shell package

24:47.800 --> 24:50.800
comes from in BOP!OS and it comes from Ubuntu.

24:50.800 --> 24:55.320
So if you look in a year's time and the GNOME Shell package

24:55.320 --> 24:59.520
that's on a stock install of System76 comes from their PPA,

24:59.520 --> 25:03.320
then you could argue that that's a light or heavy fork

25:03.320 --> 25:04.640
depending upon how changed it is.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.280
But if they're using GNOME Shell from Ubuntu,

25:06.280 --> 25:07.800
then it isn't really, is it?

25:07.800 --> 25:09.320
I think what the line should be is

25:09.320 --> 25:14.240
if GNOME Shell starts shipping from a System76-owned repo,

25:14.240 --> 25:17.320
that's at least the beginning of some kind of shift there.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.960
And I think that's a line I'd be comfortable with passing

25:19.960 --> 25:20.880
or failing by.

25:20.880 --> 25:25.680
You could say that System76 starts shipping their own

25:25.680 --> 25:27.800
or starts hosting their own GNOME Shell version

25:27.800 --> 25:29.200
or something like that, maybe.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.040
Maintaining is the key word.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.400
Maintaining, OK.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.120
All right, OK.

25:33.120 --> 25:35.000
All right, I'm going to lock that in.

25:35.000 --> 25:39.560
I predict that System76 will begin in 2021

25:39.560 --> 25:44.720
to maintain their own GNOME Shell packages.

25:44.720 --> 25:45.240
Good?

25:45.240 --> 25:45.440
Yeah.

25:45.440 --> 25:46.000
We're good with that one?

25:46.000 --> 25:46.640
Good job.

25:46.640 --> 25:47.720
OK.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.120
All right, Mr. Payne, would you like to go next?

25:50.120 --> 25:53.120
I'm going to say that Linus announces

25:53.120 --> 25:56.760
a change in his day-to-day involvement with the kernel.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.200
Whoa.

25:58.200 --> 25:59.320
What do we think about that?

25:59.320 --> 26:00.960
It makes me sad.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.160
I think he maybe should do it, to be honest with you,

26:03.160 --> 26:06.480
because he himself says he mostly just does email now,

26:06.480 --> 26:08.320
and that's got to get tedious.

26:08.320 --> 26:10.640
I don't know that it necessarily means he's not involved at all

26:10.640 --> 26:12.520
anymore, but a significant change

26:12.520 --> 26:14.840
to how he contributes day-to-day.

26:14.840 --> 26:18.520
How are you going to define significant change?

26:18.520 --> 26:20.680
I feel like that's kind of vague.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.640
Well, we'll be reporting on the show.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.360
It'll be news in the open source community, right?

26:25.360 --> 26:28.000
There'll be articles on the register, ZDNet.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.080
LWN will talk about it, right?

26:30.080 --> 26:33.880
So the prediction could be something like, in 2021,

26:33.880 --> 26:36.240
it'll become public that Linus is stepping down,

26:36.240 --> 26:38.800
or is becoming less involved with day-to-day operation

26:38.800 --> 26:40.440
or something like that.

26:40.440 --> 26:41.360
What do you think, Judge?

26:41.360 --> 26:45.080
Yeah, I think we need to refine it slightly more than that.

26:45.080 --> 26:47.600
We need to be more precise about it.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.440
I mean, what exactly is this job title at the moment?

26:50.440 --> 26:54.440
Like, benevolent dictator or whatever, head maintainer.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.920
Like, you'd have to say, I think,

26:55.920 --> 26:58.400
that he's not going to be the head maintainer anymore.

26:58.400 --> 26:59.120
Yeah, OK, I'm right.

26:59.120 --> 27:01.160
Maybe he's still involved, but he's

27:01.160 --> 27:04.200
no longer doing the actual releases for each version.

27:04.200 --> 27:04.720
I don't know.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.800
I like this idea that, so where you were originally

27:07.800 --> 27:09.240
going with this, Wes, that I liked,

27:09.240 --> 27:12.520
was this idea that Linus is still the boss,

27:12.520 --> 27:16.920
but he pulls back a bit and just lives more of his life.

27:16.920 --> 27:17.400
Right.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.200
You know, he still shows up.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.120
He maybe makes some consequential decisions

27:20.120 --> 27:21.760
or settles arguments on the mailing list,

27:21.760 --> 27:24.040
but he's not the one cutting these releases

27:24.040 --> 27:25.480
each cycle or something.

27:25.480 --> 27:28.400
And I think that's the core of what

27:28.400 --> 27:29.600
you were going at originally.

27:29.600 --> 27:33.480
And that's the scenario that I really hope eventually

27:33.480 --> 27:34.360
does happen for Linus.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.880
I hope it's not the burnout scenario.

27:35.880 --> 27:38.520
But I wonder if maybe what is left for him

27:38.520 --> 27:40.400
is just the parts he does enjoy.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.760
He may actually just genuinely enjoy what he's doing.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.440
Linus, clearly, you just need to come on the show

27:44.440 --> 27:45.360
and talk to us about it.

27:45.360 --> 27:47.120
We know you're listening.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.440
So what do you think, Judge?

27:48.440 --> 27:51.680
Is it something to the extent of like,

27:51.680 --> 27:53.600
because here's the other bar we could go by.

27:53.600 --> 27:57.920
Instead of really deciding how we want to define less involved,

27:57.920 --> 28:00.400
what we could just define is, how much reporting is there

28:00.400 --> 28:02.200
about Linus stepping back in some form?

28:02.200 --> 28:06.880
And if there is reporting, like if he posts a mailing list

28:06.880 --> 28:10.840
saying that I'm going to take every week off or something

28:10.840 --> 28:13.720
in a month, something that gets then picked up on LWN,

28:13.720 --> 28:15.160
I think that could be a qualifier.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.640
That's something we could judge against.

28:16.640 --> 28:17.120
Maybe.

28:17.120 --> 28:20.200
But I think it doesn't really matter who reports on it.

28:20.200 --> 28:23.480
I think the fact that he publicly announces it,

28:23.480 --> 28:24.760
I think that's the key thing.

28:24.760 --> 28:25.360
That works.

28:25.360 --> 28:27.080
So I could say something like he publicly

28:27.080 --> 28:31.000
announces stepping back in his day-to-day roles in the kernel?

28:31.000 --> 28:31.480
Yeah.

28:31.480 --> 28:32.120
Yeah.

28:32.120 --> 28:34.200
I think that's pretty easy to say if it happened or not.

28:34.200 --> 28:35.880
All right, you ready to lock it in, Wes?

28:35.880 --> 28:38.440
I predict that Linus Torvalds will make an announcement

28:38.440 --> 28:41.720
sometime in 2021, and he's stepping back

28:41.720 --> 28:44.240
to some degree from his day-to-day involvement

28:44.240 --> 28:47.080
with the Linux kernel.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.000
All right, very nice.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.160
And then we have a little breaking news kind of related.

28:50.160 --> 28:52.560
JJ, you had something you wanted to pass along.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.200
So I was trying to look and see if there

28:54.200 --> 28:56.440
was any other developments from Linus Torvalds,

28:56.440 --> 28:59.560
and apparently when I was looking at the main page,

28:59.560 --> 29:01.200
his birthday was yesterday.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.960
Hey, happy birthday, Linus.

29:03.960 --> 29:07.120
And it doesn't look a day over 37.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.080
All right.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.560
So Wes, that's a good one.

29:10.560 --> 29:12.680
I hope that it's a positive announcement if it happens.

29:12.680 --> 29:14.600
All right, Drew, are you ready to make your first prediction

29:14.600 --> 29:15.640
here on the show?

29:15.640 --> 29:19.440
So I predict in 2021 that Google will

29:19.440 --> 29:23.560
release an official Chrome OS installer for x86 machines.

29:23.560 --> 29:24.440
Oh, that's good.

29:24.440 --> 29:28.520
And they just recently bought that company that Neverware.

29:28.520 --> 29:30.920
So how does that, what's official,

29:30.920 --> 29:33.600
what is the gray area in that after this acquisition,

29:33.600 --> 29:34.240
I'm wondering?

29:34.240 --> 29:39.440
Well, specifically not something like Neverware branded.

29:39.440 --> 29:43.360
So they purchased Neverware, who makes a product that

29:43.360 --> 29:47.640
allows you to install Chrome OS on any x86 machine.

29:47.640 --> 29:49.360
And so now that Google owns them,

29:49.360 --> 29:53.440
there will be an officially Google-sanctioned product

29:53.440 --> 29:56.480
that you can install on x86 machines.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.720
Well, and so there'll be an ISO that you can download

29:58.720 --> 30:00.160
from a Google domain, maybe?

30:00.160 --> 30:00.640
Yes.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.840
Wow.

30:01.840 --> 30:04.240
Would something like an official Chromium OS

30:04.240 --> 30:05.240
from Google count?

30:05.240 --> 30:08.320
I think it'll be Chrome OS, not Chromium OS.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.720
And it's pitched as any PC?

30:10.720 --> 30:11.960
I think this is solid.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.800
Any x86 PC.

30:13.800 --> 30:14.680
Right.

30:14.680 --> 30:15.440
All right.

30:15.440 --> 30:20.040
I predict in 2021 that Google will release an official ISO

30:20.040 --> 30:25.280
image for Chrome OS for x86 computers.

30:25.280 --> 30:26.840
What I really like about that one, Drew,

30:26.840 --> 30:28.640
is you've been following the news

30:28.640 --> 30:32.520
and then extrapolating from that, which is what my strategy

30:32.520 --> 30:33.280
tries.

30:33.280 --> 30:34.720
That's generally my strategy is like,

30:34.720 --> 30:37.400
I got to leverage the fact that I follow the news every week.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.520
So let's just take those to their natural conclusion.

30:39.520 --> 30:40.800
And that's exactly what you did there.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.280
Hey, we're going three for three this year.

30:43.280 --> 30:47.200
OK, Alex, let's see how your first one stacks up.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.400
All right, so mine is right up your street.

30:49.400 --> 30:51.480
It's about the Raspberry Pi.

30:51.480 --> 30:54.720
I predict that the Raspberry Pi 5,

30:54.720 --> 30:57.800
if that's what they call it, the next major version

30:57.800 --> 31:00.600
of the Raspberry Pi, so I think 5 is a decent guess,

31:00.600 --> 31:03.680
will ship with support for proper storage.

31:03.680 --> 31:06.800
So it will have either a SATA port, or an mSATA,

31:06.800 --> 31:09.160
or an NVMe slot on it.

31:09.160 --> 31:09.660
Ooh.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.160
Oh, gosh.

31:11.160 --> 31:11.800
I sure hope.

31:11.800 --> 31:12.600
Yeah, right?

31:12.600 --> 31:15.840
Boy, so it's not necessarily a Raspberry Pi 5, you're saying,

31:15.840 --> 31:17.200
but a Raspberry Pi product.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.080
Yeah, yeah.

31:18.080 --> 31:22.960
So I think the next major release that happens in 2021

31:22.960 --> 31:27.320
will have support for an NVMe, or an m.2 SATA,

31:27.320 --> 31:29.640
or some kind of built-in storage.

31:29.640 --> 31:31.960
Hopefully not eMMC, but I'll take it

31:31.960 --> 31:33.400
if that gets me the prediction.

31:33.400 --> 31:37.320
Isn't the Raspberry Pi compute module right now,

31:37.320 --> 31:40.200
doesn't have PCI lanes on there that you can wire up if you?

31:40.200 --> 31:42.080
Yeah, Jeff Geerling's been doing a bunch of work

31:42.080 --> 31:43.240
around that kind of stuff.

31:43.240 --> 31:46.960
That could be step one in what you're talking about, right?

31:46.960 --> 31:47.920
That could be step one.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.240
Hopefully, hopefully.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.800
Clearly, clearly, clearly, we're using the Raspberry Pi 4.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.840
Now, especially with the 8 gig model,

31:54.840 --> 31:57.960
the limitation is the storage options.

31:57.960 --> 32:00.800
It just so obviously is.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.680
And that's made better by USB 3 and being

32:03.680 --> 32:05.000
able to boot from those disks.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.480
And it's also, if you're willing to go with something

32:07.480 --> 32:10.200
like NFS or iSCSI, it has a gigabit NIC on there.

32:10.200 --> 32:13.040
But it's still not as great as just local NVMe storage

32:13.040 --> 32:13.680
or something.

32:13.680 --> 32:14.920
So I think that's pretty good, ref.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.480
You think there's anything he's got to bang out with that

32:16.480 --> 32:17.840
before we lock it in?

32:17.840 --> 32:20.160
I would only suggest that you put

32:20.160 --> 32:23.360
a caveat of there being an option for built-in storage

32:23.360 --> 32:26.160
because I could see them releasing two versions.

32:26.160 --> 32:29.640
Like they've got the 4 gigabyte and 8 gigabyte RAM ones now.

32:29.640 --> 32:32.080
You might have one that just has an SD card and one

32:32.080 --> 32:34.560
that has an SD card and EMMC or whatever.

32:34.560 --> 32:40.280
Yeah, because the Compute Module 4 has EMMC on it now.

32:40.280 --> 32:42.240
So yeah, I think you're probably right with that.

32:42.240 --> 32:45.120
Yeah, so I would say something like there'll

32:45.120 --> 32:49.120
be one available that has an option to boot

32:49.120 --> 32:52.800
from built-in storage that isn't the SD card or something

32:52.800 --> 32:53.440
like that.

32:53.440 --> 32:57.160
All right, so I predict in 2021, the next major release

32:57.160 --> 33:00.040
of the Raspberry Pi, maybe the Pi 5,

33:00.040 --> 33:04.440
will have an option for a proper storage system.

33:04.440 --> 33:11.000
So that's NVMe or M.2 SATA or just a genuine SATA port.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.360
Yeah, I hope you're right on that one.

33:12.360 --> 33:13.280
That would be great.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.880
Let's hope your winning streak continues.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.560
Let's hope.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.480
So since Joe is judge, he only gets to,

33:18.480 --> 33:20.640
well, he only has to actually, I should say,

33:20.640 --> 33:21.920
make one crazy prediction.

33:21.920 --> 33:23.760
So we loop back around to me again.

33:23.760 --> 33:28.480
And I'm going to go with one that, my goodness, better

33:28.480 --> 33:31.480
happen or else the industry is in a world of hurt.

33:31.480 --> 33:33.600
But I predict that Qualcomm will come out

33:33.600 --> 33:38.080
with an ARM SOC that matches or beats Apple's M1.

33:38.080 --> 33:41.640
And it will be possible to boot Linux or actually maybe just

33:41.640 --> 33:45.400
Android on those systems.

33:45.400 --> 33:48.560
I mean, this is totally quantifiable,

33:48.560 --> 33:50.720
but you're totally wrong about it.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.640
You guys are telling me nobody in mainstream ARM

33:52.640 --> 33:54.240
that ships on consumer devices is

33:54.240 --> 33:56.600
going to be able to match Apple, that Apple is

33:56.600 --> 33:58.360
that incredible at engineering?

33:58.360 --> 34:00.320
It's not that they're incredible at engineering.

34:00.320 --> 34:05.080
It's that Apple doesn't have to care about supply chain

34:05.080 --> 34:06.720
and demand margins.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.120
Everyone else does.

34:08.120 --> 34:11.520
So I mean, I think that makes it a fun pick myself.

34:11.520 --> 34:13.320
Yeah, it's outlandish for sure.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.720
Yeah, the least likely the better.

34:14.720 --> 34:15.800
I support this.

34:15.800 --> 34:20.440
OK, should I remove Qualcomm and say a ARM distributor,

34:20.440 --> 34:22.560
an ARM chip distributor?

34:22.560 --> 34:24.600
Yeah, an ARM manufacturer other than Apple

34:24.600 --> 34:27.200
will come out with a system on a chip

34:27.200 --> 34:30.240
that is as powerful or more than the M1.

34:30.240 --> 34:31.360
That's how I'd phrase it.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.740
How do you measure that, though?

34:32.740 --> 34:36.480
Is it a Geekbench score or some kind of, what's the metric?

34:36.480 --> 34:37.760
I'll go Geekbench.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.600
Geekbench is fine with me.

34:39.600 --> 34:42.680
That's the one that most of the M1 folks are using.

34:42.680 --> 34:44.880
For the people that don't know Project Skybridge,

34:44.880 --> 34:50.960
AMD has a Project Skybridge where they have ARM and x86

34:50.960 --> 34:52.360
as a single platform.

34:52.360 --> 34:53.880
Yeah, I don't think that counts.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.400
I think it's got to be pure ARM.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.560
So we're going down on the record right here saying

34:57.560 --> 35:02.200
that at the end of 2020, we're looking out of all of 2021,

35:02.200 --> 35:05.520
even though the whole industry knew that Apple was, you know,

35:05.520 --> 35:08.360
they've known about what these CPUs can do for a little while.

35:08.360 --> 35:09.920
So they've had years to start ramping up.

35:09.920 --> 35:11.420
But what we are saying at this point

35:11.420 --> 35:16.520
is we have so little faith that just saying an ARM manufacturer

35:16.520 --> 35:20.480
might beat the M1 is a risky prediction, and I love it.

35:20.480 --> 35:23.520
So I'm going to say an ARM manufacturer comes out

35:23.520 --> 35:27.480
with an ARM SoC that matches or beats Apple's M1 on Geekbench.

35:27.480 --> 35:28.200
Yeah.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.140
Yeah, OK, I'll leave it at that.

35:29.140 --> 35:30.440
I was going to add another qualifier,

35:30.440 --> 35:32.440
but I don't think I need to put myself in a box.

35:32.440 --> 35:34.480
So officially, locking it in with this,

35:34.480 --> 35:37.040
an ARM manufacturer in 2021 will come out

35:37.040 --> 35:44.920
with an ARM SoC that matches or beats Apple's M1 on Geekbench.

35:44.920 --> 35:48.720
All right, Mr. West, you are up, sir.

35:48.720 --> 35:50.560
You got a prediction for us?

35:50.560 --> 35:54.440
I'm going to say GNOME fixes their plug-in architecture.

35:54.440 --> 35:58.240
We get a real plug-in API and a bad plug-in.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.760
While it might still hurt your system,

35:59.760 --> 36:02.640
it won't crash the whole dang shell.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.880
I needed a good laugh before the end of the year, thanks,

36:04.880 --> 36:08.000
Mr. West.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.840
It doesn't seem to be on the horizon for 40,

36:09.840 --> 36:12.160
but maybe it lands in 41 or 42.

36:12.160 --> 36:14.640
Something I'm hoping for, anyway.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.800
I like this, though, because again, like your Linus one,

36:17.800 --> 36:21.720
if it pans out right, it's a good thing for all of us.

36:21.720 --> 36:24.640
Do you think there's anything he has to qualify there, Ref?

36:24.640 --> 36:26.440
It just seems a little bit hard to measure

36:26.440 --> 36:27.560
is the only problem.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.860
Well, it'd be like a new API, right?

36:28.860 --> 36:30.440
They'd be making an announcement about,

36:30.440 --> 36:32.760
here's the way we're building plug-ins going forward,

36:32.760 --> 36:33.560
something like that.

36:33.560 --> 36:34.320
Right.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.760
OK, so not just an improvement, but a whole new API.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.880
Yeah, I think that's quantifiable then, yeah.

36:38.880 --> 36:41.320
They do have a new extensions effort that's essentially,

36:41.320 --> 36:43.160
like, we're going to increase communication

36:43.160 --> 36:45.400
and make sure that people are sharing information.

36:45.400 --> 36:48.240
That they've already announced, but there's no real, like,

36:48.240 --> 36:50.160
an API would truly be the benchmark.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.800
And I think we could probably be loose on what the definition

36:52.800 --> 36:54.280
of an API is, even.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.480
All right, I guess I'll try to lock this in, huh?

36:56.480 --> 36:57.480
Go for it.

36:57.480 --> 37:00.920
I predict that in 2021, GNOME finally

37:00.920 --> 37:05.960
fixes their plug-in problem with a new API they've announced.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.520
That means a misbehaving plug-in can no longer

37:08.520 --> 37:12.320
crash your whole dang shell.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.240
Again, with some of these predictions from your lips

37:14.240 --> 37:16.160
to the developers' ears.

37:16.160 --> 37:18.200
OK, Mr. Drew, are you feeling like you've

37:18.200 --> 37:19.280
got another one in you?

37:19.280 --> 37:20.160
Oh, I got another one.

37:20.160 --> 37:20.920
It's a good one.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.280
OK, OK.

37:22.280 --> 37:26.080
I predict in 2021 that VMware will go independent.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.160
Ooh.

37:27.160 --> 37:28.880
This is a fascinating little insight

37:28.880 --> 37:31.760
you must have picked up somewhere recently.

37:31.760 --> 37:34.080
What leads you to this conclusion?

37:34.080 --> 37:38.040
They're kind of leaning away from Dell.

37:38.040 --> 37:40.640
That's really the only thing, is just

37:40.640 --> 37:42.640
kind of reading what they're doing.

37:42.640 --> 37:46.520
I use VMware at work, and I don't

37:46.520 --> 37:48.840
see a lot of Dell influence in them anymore.

37:48.840 --> 37:51.120
So would VMware getting sold to another company

37:51.120 --> 37:52.200
not qualify, then?

37:52.200 --> 37:54.040
No, I think they will go independent.

37:54.040 --> 37:54.640
OK.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.120
Thing is on that one, though, Drew,

37:56.120 --> 37:59.920
is that VMware are basically trying

37:59.920 --> 38:02.280
to steal Red Hat's lunch with Tanzu

38:02.280 --> 38:04.640
and their play against OpenShift.

38:04.640 --> 38:09.080
So lots of people have to pay the VMware tax right now.

38:09.080 --> 38:11.920
And I think the biggest risk that VMware have moving forward

38:11.920 --> 38:16.280
is people want to just run containers on the bare metal

38:16.280 --> 38:19.360
and use something like OpenShift or Rancher

38:19.360 --> 38:23.000
or any other Kubernetes distribution

38:23.000 --> 38:24.760
to kind of get rid of that VMware tax.

38:24.760 --> 38:27.480
So I think maybe some of the stuff you're seeing

38:27.480 --> 38:30.760
is them focusing on that kind of hybrid cloud

38:30.760 --> 38:33.920
enterprise-y type sweet spot, because they

38:33.920 --> 38:37.040
can see a future where VMs just aren't needed anymore.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.880
Oh, I don't think you're wrong there.

38:38.880 --> 38:43.680
But I think that they have a lot of irons in the fire.

38:43.680 --> 38:45.440
And I don't think that Dell plays

38:45.440 --> 38:46.880
a huge part in their future.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.360
Yes, fascinating prediction.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.600
I'll be interested to see how this one plays out.

38:50.600 --> 38:52.480
It seems pretty straightforward there, Ref.

38:52.480 --> 38:53.360
Yeah, yeah.

38:53.360 --> 38:58.400
I predict in 2021 that VMware will go independent.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.160
That is a spicy one.

39:00.160 --> 39:02.200
I like it.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.240
OK, Alex, you're up.

39:03.240 --> 39:04.400
You got another one for us?

39:04.400 --> 39:05.480
I do indeed.

39:05.480 --> 39:11.720
So a project I've done recently was running a virtual GPU

39:11.720 --> 39:13.240
on top of Proxmox.

39:13.240 --> 39:16.240
And in the research for that, I came across some videos

39:16.240 --> 39:17.280
by Wendell.

39:17.280 --> 39:21.680
And he was talking about how the new Nvidia graphics cards

39:21.680 --> 39:24.800
might have something called SRIOV, which

39:24.800 --> 39:27.080
would allow you to slice up one GPU

39:27.080 --> 39:30.000
and pass it through to multiple VMs at the same time.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.120
Now, this technology already exists in the data center

39:33.120 --> 39:36.240
if you're willing to pay for something like Nvidia Grid.

39:36.240 --> 39:38.480
But it doesn't really exist at the consumer level,

39:38.480 --> 39:41.520
because obviously Nvidia and AMD and all that

39:41.520 --> 39:43.200
want to sell more graphics cards.

39:43.200 --> 39:46.520
So my prediction is this.

39:46.520 --> 39:50.360
The upcoming Intel Xe discrete GPUs

39:50.360 --> 39:53.880
will support SRIOV out of the box.

39:53.880 --> 39:55.000
All right.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.400
That's pretty concise.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.800
That also won't happen.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.720
Well, then it makes it even more interesting.

40:00.720 --> 40:05.160
Well, because they already do GPU splitting now

40:05.160 --> 40:10.360
with a different technology, mediated devices through GVT.

40:10.360 --> 40:14.680
And so that's effectively a total substitute for SRIOV.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.840
Yeah, why do you think they would change it, Alex?

40:16.840 --> 40:18.960
I must admit, I wasn't up to speed

40:18.960 --> 40:21.720
on the technical nuance there.

40:21.720 --> 40:24.120
I thought SRIOV was just a different name

40:24.120 --> 40:25.080
for the same thing.

40:25.080 --> 40:27.160
So if I could qualify my prediction

40:27.160 --> 40:31.680
to be that the upcoming Intel discrete GPUs will support

40:31.680 --> 40:33.760
virtual graphics card slicing.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.160
OK, let's judge.

40:35.160 --> 40:37.280
Unless you have anything you want,

40:37.280 --> 40:38.440
I think we should lock it in.

40:38.440 --> 40:39.720
Yeah, let's lock it in.

40:39.720 --> 40:42.560
The upcoming Intel Xe discrete graphics cards

40:42.560 --> 40:47.480
will support virtual graphics card slicing through SRIOV,

40:47.480 --> 40:53.120
or mediated devices through the GVT technology.

40:53.120 --> 40:53.760
I like that.

40:53.760 --> 40:54.360
That's good.

40:54.360 --> 40:58.400
I'd love to see that because it just gets more value out

40:58.400 --> 40:59.920
of those machines.

40:59.920 --> 41:01.360
I'm going to go again.

41:01.360 --> 41:06.120
And I'm going to say this is my last one.

41:06.120 --> 41:08.240
So I have a couple more on here.

41:08.240 --> 41:10.440
I was really tempted to do one about the M1.

41:10.440 --> 41:12.560
But I'm going to save that for the mumble round.

41:12.560 --> 41:13.840
I've got one for the M1.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.520
OK, so I'll save it for you guys.

41:15.520 --> 41:19.360
And I'm going to say that a distribution announces

41:19.360 --> 41:23.720
that it has more users on WSL than actual physical metal

41:23.720 --> 41:25.800
installs.

41:25.800 --> 41:27.200
I can't see that happening.

41:27.200 --> 41:29.320
I can't see them announcing, because that

41:29.320 --> 41:31.080
would mean they'd have to announce numbers.

41:31.080 --> 41:33.120
And none of the distros want to announce numbers.

41:33.120 --> 41:35.800
I suppose they could say they have more of a proportion

41:35.800 --> 41:37.880
and not actually say what the numbers are.

41:37.880 --> 41:38.440
Right.

41:38.440 --> 41:39.280
You don't think so, Poppy?

41:39.280 --> 41:40.400
You don't think it's going to happen?

41:40.400 --> 41:43.120
I think it's just really hard for what Joe says.

41:43.120 --> 41:49.520
It's like, so if it's not true, then the Australian question

41:49.520 --> 41:50.840
wouldn't say it.

41:50.840 --> 41:51.880
And if it was true.

41:51.880 --> 41:55.320
Are you implying, Poppy, that it may already be the case,

41:55.320 --> 41:56.880
but nobody has just said it?

41:56.880 --> 41:57.840
No.

41:57.840 --> 42:03.040
If it was the case, or if it wasn't the case, in both ways,

42:03.040 --> 42:06.560
they're going to harm themselves by saying it.

42:06.560 --> 42:07.080
I don't know.

42:07.080 --> 42:07.760
I don't know why.

42:07.760 --> 42:08.000
Why?

42:08.000 --> 42:12.080
Why is that harmful to say that we have 3 million WSL users

42:12.080 --> 42:14.560
and we have, I mean, that's probably too many.

42:14.560 --> 42:16.200
But if you think about it, and I think

42:16.200 --> 42:17.960
you know what some of the actual deployment numbers

42:17.960 --> 42:19.400
are of some of these distributions,

42:19.400 --> 42:22.400
it's not inconceivable for one of them

42:22.400 --> 42:24.680
to get more users on Windows.

42:24.680 --> 42:25.800
It doesn't seem to me.

42:25.800 --> 42:29.760
It might be more conceivable for a smaller distro,

42:29.760 --> 42:33.080
because the numbers are so small that it might be actually

42:33.080 --> 42:35.280
a thing that they wouldn't mind saying.

42:35.280 --> 42:35.800
Right.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.280
Yeah, or a purpose-built distro.

42:37.280 --> 42:41.040
Well, I feel, OK, so that I feel like is not,

42:41.040 --> 42:43.080
that's where this prediction, I feel like,

42:43.080 --> 42:44.040
is a little bit too easy.

42:44.040 --> 42:44.640
I can't say like.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.920
That's not quite in the spirit of what you're suggesting.

42:46.920 --> 42:48.200
Yeah, there's a couple of distros

42:48.200 --> 42:49.560
that are targeted just to WSL.

42:49.560 --> 42:53.840
And I feel like that's a no-brainer, of course.

42:53.840 --> 42:56.200
Here's what I think kind of gives me an edge up,

42:56.200 --> 42:58.760
is it might come from the Microsoft side.

42:58.760 --> 43:01.600
Maybe not even intentionally, or something like that.

43:01.600 --> 43:04.320
Maybe it's like an offhanded comment that, oh, yeah, yeah,

43:04.320 --> 43:07.440
you know, XYZ actually has more users on WSL

43:07.440 --> 43:09.360
than they have physical installs on the wild.

43:09.360 --> 43:12.120
And it's just not even something that's released by the distro.

43:12.120 --> 43:13.080
But they wouldn't know that.

43:13.080 --> 43:15.000
They can't know that number, because they are not

43:15.000 --> 43:16.520
in the infrastructure for the distro.

43:16.520 --> 43:17.320
True, true.

43:17.320 --> 43:20.240
OK, here's the root of what I'm trying to get out there,

43:20.240 --> 43:24.520
is I think you have a lot of middle-tier distros

43:24.520 --> 43:29.240
that maybe have 30, 40, 50,000 installs, maybe as many,

43:29.240 --> 43:31.160
if they're lucky, as of 100,000.

43:31.160 --> 43:34.400
And I don't think that's an impossible number

43:34.400 --> 43:36.080
to get surpassed on WSL.

43:36.080 --> 43:38.760
And I think it's going to happen within the next year.

43:38.760 --> 43:41.200
I guess what you guys are saying is, it may happen,

43:41.200 --> 43:42.480
and we'll never know.

43:42.480 --> 43:44.520
So how do I make, because to me, it just

43:44.520 --> 43:46.720
seems like an obvious thing that's going to happen.

43:46.720 --> 43:48.880
I'd love to get on the record saying it's going to happen.

43:48.880 --> 43:50.200
But there's no way to measure it.

43:50.200 --> 43:52.480
I think it's a reasonable thing for you to predict.

43:52.480 --> 43:56.240
And I think it's not unreasonable to think someone

43:56.240 --> 44:00.480
might let that slip, or someone in a fit of peak and PR

44:00.480 --> 44:03.260
might decide to actively promote that as a thing.

44:03.260 --> 44:04.480
I think it's fair to say.

44:04.480 --> 44:07.520
Yeah, that's why I should have gone with my Rocky Linux one,

44:07.520 --> 44:11.400
because I could be an easy winner.

44:11.400 --> 44:13.080
Damn it, damn it.

44:13.080 --> 44:17.720
See, I could make one up on the spot, but I don't really know.

44:17.720 --> 44:18.800
OK.

44:18.800 --> 44:22.240
So I think, Judge, what it comes down to is,

44:22.240 --> 44:25.360
I could still go with it, but it's a small shot

44:25.360 --> 44:26.920
that it actually ever goes public.

44:26.920 --> 44:30.000
Yeah, as the ref, I can say, that's totally fine to say it.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.280
But as Joe, I'm going to say, you haven't got a chance, mate.

44:33.280 --> 44:35.360
Yeah, OK.

44:35.360 --> 44:37.640
I know it's going to happen if it hasn't happened already.

44:37.640 --> 44:39.160
It's going to happen any day.

44:39.160 --> 44:40.760
I think it's a good prediction.

44:40.760 --> 44:41.680
I'm going to do it.

44:41.680 --> 44:43.160
I'm going to do it because Popeye's egging me on,

44:43.160 --> 44:44.600
so I'm going to do it.

44:44.600 --> 44:45.800
Shoot for the stars, Chris.

44:45.800 --> 44:46.640
Do it.

44:46.640 --> 44:49.600
All right, I'm going to say that in 2021,

44:49.600 --> 44:52.260
it becomes public that a distribution has

44:52.260 --> 44:57.360
more users on WSL than physical installs in the wild.

44:57.360 --> 44:59.560
OK, Wes, let's round out yours with your third and last

44:59.560 --> 45:00.320
prediction.

45:00.320 --> 45:02.800
Oh, OK, my final prediction.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.800
I'm going to make it a good one, I suppose.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.760
Yeah, make up for mine, would you, because that was rough.

45:07.760 --> 45:10.260
All right, let's say that there's a Rust-based kernel

45:10.260 --> 45:12.520
module that is widely distributed,

45:12.520 --> 45:15.200
either included optionally in the main tree

45:15.200 --> 45:17.800
or shipped by Ubuntu, Fedora, or Arch.

45:17.800 --> 45:20.920
I'm sorry, what did you say there, Wes?

45:20.920 --> 45:21.480
Did you say?

45:21.480 --> 45:22.480
RUST!

45:29.280 --> 45:32.640
Every time I see this coming up, I know that it's Rust,

45:32.640 --> 45:34.560
even when I haven't listened to the show.

45:34.560 --> 45:36.400
I just recognized the waveform at this point.

45:36.400 --> 45:36.900
Yeah.

45:39.480 --> 45:41.860
I love this idea, and it's a solid one.

45:41.860 --> 45:44.760
And you know it gets some hype because, you know, Rust.

45:44.760 --> 45:48.200
So I don't really have any problems with this,

45:48.200 --> 45:50.640
because I feel like it would go public.

45:50.640 --> 45:53.000
Most modules, nobody really talks about in the news,

45:53.000 --> 45:56.360
but a Rust module, I'm talking about it.

45:56.360 --> 45:57.360
What do you think, Judge?

45:57.360 --> 45:58.800
Yeah, I think lock it in.

45:58.800 --> 46:03.000
I predict that in 2021, the first Rust-based kernel module

46:03.000 --> 46:05.400
will be widely distributed, either optionally

46:05.400 --> 46:10.520
in the main tree or shipped by Ubuntu, Fedora, or Arch.

46:10.520 --> 46:13.040
Man, you know, you didn't even have to lock it down.

46:13.040 --> 46:15.560
You could have left it open-ended for if it ships

46:15.560 --> 46:17.800
in a distro or not.

46:17.800 --> 46:19.480
OK, well, Drew, are you ready for your?

46:19.480 --> 46:22.040
What's the matter, you tell me?

46:22.040 --> 46:23.000
Sorry, there, Wes.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.200
You know, you always got to play the game.

46:24.200 --> 46:25.160
You always got to play the game.

46:25.160 --> 46:27.500
Drew, are you ready for your third and final prediction,

46:27.500 --> 46:28.000
sir?

46:28.000 --> 46:33.200
So another enterprising prediction from me,

46:33.200 --> 46:36.200
Rancher ownership will change hands.

46:36.200 --> 46:37.120
What?

46:37.120 --> 46:38.320
No, I don't see that one.

46:38.320 --> 46:41.080
They just, didn't Sousa just buy them this year?

46:41.080 --> 46:42.600
They just got a new brand on them.

46:42.600 --> 46:44.680
Yeah, and it's like, by the way, one

46:44.680 --> 46:46.760
of my unofficial predictions was that Sousa would up

46:46.760 --> 46:48.280
their Kubernetes game, and they did.

46:48.280 --> 46:49.560
They bought Rancher OS, dude.

46:49.560 --> 46:51.180
And it's like, that's like the big thing

46:51.180 --> 46:53.600
that they're like proud of when they're peacocking now.

46:53.600 --> 46:55.880
They're peacocking about Rancher OS.

46:55.880 --> 46:59.480
Does it include Sousa getting bought out by somebody else?

46:59.480 --> 47:03.040
It's very possible that somebody could buy Sousa for Rancher.

47:03.040 --> 47:05.680
Oh, so you're saying it changes ownership

47:05.680 --> 47:07.800
via Sousa changing ownership.

47:07.800 --> 47:11.160
Or Google just straight up buys Rancher.

47:11.160 --> 47:11.680
Who knows?

47:11.680 --> 47:14.200
I mean, there are lots of options here.

47:14.200 --> 47:17.080
But at the end of the year, I don't

47:17.080 --> 47:19.840
think that Rancher will have the same owner,

47:19.840 --> 47:24.800
be it whether Sousa gets bought or Rancher gets bought.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.000
One of the two will happen.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.640
It's about time for Sousa to get bought.

47:27.640 --> 47:30.120
It really is, yeah.

47:30.120 --> 47:33.480
I really almost went with Sousa ownership will change hands.

47:33.480 --> 47:36.120
But I think the Rancher ownership one is a little spicier,

47:36.120 --> 47:37.320
so I like it better.

47:37.320 --> 47:38.280
I think that's pretty workable.

47:38.280 --> 47:39.280
What do you think, Judge?

47:39.280 --> 47:40.640
Yeah, I think our friend.

47:40.640 --> 47:41.400
All right.

47:41.400 --> 47:47.680
I predict in 2021 that Rancher ownership will change hands.

47:47.680 --> 47:48.960
It's nice and tidy, too.

47:48.960 --> 47:50.040
I like that.

47:50.040 --> 47:52.720
OK, Alex, are you ready for a third and final prediction?

47:52.720 --> 47:53.360
I think so.

47:53.360 --> 47:56.080
I'm going to continue on the theme of hard drives

47:56.080 --> 47:58.600
like last year, because apparently that one came true,

47:58.600 --> 48:00.880
even though I didn't think it did.

48:00.880 --> 48:04.360
So the easy storyline, I'm going to base my prediction

48:04.360 --> 48:07.440
off the easy storyline that you can buy at Best Buy.

48:07.440 --> 48:12.240
The prediction is that you'll be able to buy a 20-terabyte drive

48:12.240 --> 48:17.560
for under $250 at Best Buy within 2021 at some point.

48:17.560 --> 48:19.680
I think this is too similar to last year's, man.

48:19.680 --> 48:21.680
But it's price-based, though.

48:21.680 --> 48:24.840
So instead of saying it's going to be x amount of storage,

48:24.840 --> 48:26.160
you're saying you're going to get x amount of storage

48:26.160 --> 48:28.360
for a price, which is kind of a different take on it.

48:28.360 --> 48:29.200
Yeah, true.

48:29.200 --> 48:31.280
He also specifically said Best Buy,

48:31.280 --> 48:33.200
and I kind of partly want Best Buy

48:33.200 --> 48:37.880
to go out of business this year just to screw with it.

48:37.880 --> 48:38.840
I don't know.

48:38.840 --> 48:41.800
Do you think he needs to tweak it to make it work, Ref?

48:41.800 --> 48:42.600
Or do you think it's?

48:42.600 --> 48:44.800
No, I think that is totally testable,

48:44.800 --> 48:46.080
so let's just do it.

48:46.080 --> 48:50.680
I predict slash hope that a Western Digital Easy Store

48:50.680 --> 48:54.680
20-terabyte hard drive will cost $250 or less

48:54.680 --> 48:58.400
at some point in 2021.

48:58.400 --> 48:59.680
Remove the Best Buy mention.

48:59.680 --> 49:00.160
Well done.

49:00.160 --> 49:00.960
Yeah.

49:00.960 --> 49:03.960
Oh, you can edit that in if you want.

49:03.960 --> 49:06.280
No, it's probably better, because now it's

49:06.280 --> 49:07.400
like if it's on Newegg.

49:07.400 --> 49:10.600
The thing is, the Easy Stores are Best Buy exclusives.

49:10.600 --> 49:11.600
So it's no choice.

49:11.600 --> 49:13.480
So I guess it's in there anyway.

49:13.480 --> 49:17.640
Joe, we saved the last and the best right for now,

49:17.640 --> 49:20.400
and it's you, and it is your crazy prediction of the year.

49:20.400 --> 49:21.400
Are you ready, sir?

49:21.400 --> 49:25.920
Fuchsia, I think you'll be able to download an image of that

49:25.920 --> 49:30.040
and get it working with a free desktop environment,

49:30.040 --> 49:33.680
such as XFCE or Plasma or Gnome or something,

49:33.680 --> 49:36.280
and run a browser all on Fuchsia.

49:36.280 --> 49:39.640
Not officially, necessarily, but someone will hack it together

49:39.640 --> 49:42.560
so you'll be able to boot a Fuchsia

49:42.560 --> 49:46.360
system with a browser and a proper desktop environment.

49:46.360 --> 49:48.600
And I'm not saying what the performance is going to be

49:48.600 --> 49:50.960
like, but you will be able to use a browser.

49:50.960 --> 49:51.960
Fascinating.

49:51.960 --> 49:55.120
And it's probably a Blink-based browser.

49:55.120 --> 49:56.400
Probably, yes.

49:56.400 --> 50:00.960
OK, so it's Fuchsia with all the way up to a browser

50:00.960 --> 50:02.240
is essentially the prediction.

50:02.240 --> 50:03.240
I think that's pretty straightforward.

50:03.240 --> 50:04.600
Do you want to lock it in?

50:04.600 --> 50:07.080
I predict that in 2021, you'll be

50:07.080 --> 50:12.720
able to use everything up to a browser in Fuchsia.

50:12.720 --> 50:15.600
That is going to make me nervous if that one happens.

50:15.600 --> 50:17.920
I don't want that one to come true.

50:17.920 --> 50:20.960
OK, so we're going to now go into the Mumble Room round.

50:20.960 --> 50:21.960
So good job, gentlemen.

50:21.960 --> 50:24.520
Mumble Room, tag me with mum in the chat room,

50:24.520 --> 50:27.080
and I'll call on some of you to get some of those in.

50:27.080 --> 50:29.160
And gentlemen, congratulations.

50:29.160 --> 50:32.560
Your 2021 predictions are locked in.

50:32.560 --> 50:35.720
I want to also thank our Unplugged Core contributors

50:35.720 --> 50:37.080
at unpluggedcore.com.

50:37.080 --> 50:39.400
That's a membership program that helps keep this program

50:39.400 --> 50:42.160
independent and helps reduce the ad load needed

50:42.160 --> 50:43.840
to make the show profitable.

50:43.840 --> 50:46.240
And you also, as a core contributor,

50:46.240 --> 50:47.280
get access to two feeds.

50:47.280 --> 50:49.560
A limited ad version of the show, same full production,

50:49.560 --> 50:51.200
just limited ads.

50:51.200 --> 50:53.440
And a second feed, which this week

50:53.440 --> 50:55.920
is going to be a massive, massive recording.

50:55.920 --> 50:57.400
That's the full live stream feed.

50:57.400 --> 51:00.720
All our screw ups, the stuff that never makes into the show,

51:00.720 --> 51:03.720
and a huge pre and post show that

51:03.720 --> 51:05.320
doesn't get recorded because the disk

51:05.320 --> 51:07.320
space in the main recorder would be crazy.

51:07.320 --> 51:09.600
It's basically an extra show that never gets released.

51:09.600 --> 51:11.020
And I suppose the other perk of it

51:11.020 --> 51:13.680
is it's released as fast as we can.

51:13.680 --> 51:16.440
So usually within an hour or two of us wrapping up recording,

51:16.440 --> 51:17.740
it goes out in the feed.

51:17.740 --> 51:19.760
The downside is if you're driving in the car

51:19.760 --> 51:23.760
or you want something that's a little less time consuming,

51:23.760 --> 51:25.760
that's where the main feed's a little nicer.

51:25.760 --> 51:27.120
Because it's the full production,

51:27.120 --> 51:29.800
it's been tweaked EQ wise, it sounds better,

51:29.800 --> 51:31.520
and it's shorter runtime.

51:31.520 --> 51:34.320
So that's why we make two feeds available, shorter or longer.

51:34.320 --> 51:36.960
And that just is part of being a core contributor.

51:36.960 --> 51:40.200
So thank you very much to our Unplugged Core contributors.

51:40.200 --> 51:42.900
And we now transition to the mumble room.

51:42.900 --> 51:45.760
And we'll start with Bitton.

51:45.760 --> 51:48.760
My prediction last year was that Canonical World IPO

51:48.760 --> 51:51.120
and Microsoft would buy some parts of it.

51:51.120 --> 51:52.720
That didn't happen.

51:52.720 --> 51:56.040
And my prediction this year is there

51:56.040 --> 52:01.080
will be a phone with a Linux kernel sold in stores that's

52:01.080 --> 52:02.040
not Android.

52:02.040 --> 52:03.600
Will stores exist?

52:03.600 --> 52:05.400
Yeah.

52:05.400 --> 52:06.200
Maybe Amazon.

52:06.200 --> 52:06.640
OK.

52:06.640 --> 52:07.440
Does Amazon count?

52:07.440 --> 52:08.640
I think Amazon should count.

52:08.640 --> 52:10.680
I like that.

52:10.680 --> 52:12.360
OK, Poppy, I know you've got a few.

52:12.360 --> 52:14.000
So what are yours, sir?

52:14.000 --> 52:15.760
Do you want the good, the bad, or the ugly?

52:15.760 --> 52:17.480
Ooh, all of them.

52:17.480 --> 52:18.440
Just give them all to me.

52:18.440 --> 52:19.140
Just rapid fire.

52:19.140 --> 52:19.640
All right.

52:19.640 --> 52:23.980
So in contrary to Bitton, I predict in 2021,

52:23.980 --> 52:28.920
Canonical will neither IPO nor be bought by Microsoft.

52:28.920 --> 52:30.280
OK.

52:30.280 --> 52:33.160
In 2021, Hector Martin and collaborators

52:33.160 --> 52:39.440
will get 90% of the hardware in the first generation M1 Max

52:39.440 --> 52:41.160
booting on Linux.

52:41.160 --> 52:44.360
Now, does the GPU count as 10% or does that count more?

52:44.360 --> 52:49.080
I would go by whatever Hector's gauge of what 90% is.

52:49.080 --> 52:49.720
OK.

52:49.720 --> 52:50.240
OK.

52:50.240 --> 52:52.600
I'd be great to see that.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.880
And then is this next one the good or the ugly?

52:54.880 --> 52:55.800
The ugly.

52:55.800 --> 52:56.280
OK.

52:56.280 --> 52:58.960
In 2021, Red Hat will do something

52:58.960 --> 53:02.640
disliked by the community, which intentionally makes life hard

53:02.640 --> 53:04.400
for the ROX Linux developers.

53:04.400 --> 53:06.400
Oh.

53:06.400 --> 53:07.920
I think it's going to be the opposite,

53:07.920 --> 53:10.240
but that would be very spicy.

53:10.240 --> 53:11.120
All right, thank you, sir.

53:11.120 --> 53:12.200
I like those.

53:12.200 --> 53:13.600
Bight, I know you've got a few, too.

53:13.600 --> 53:14.560
Do you want to jump in?

53:14.560 --> 53:18.680
I don't think Google goes that big with Fusio.

53:18.680 --> 53:24.800
I think Google coming here will take their next big step,

53:24.800 --> 53:26.680
but only until then.

53:26.680 --> 53:27.200
All right.

53:27.200 --> 53:28.360
I hope you're right about that.

53:28.360 --> 53:29.280
I think that'd be really good.

53:29.280 --> 53:30.840
Now, did you have a couple other ones?

53:30.840 --> 53:37.080
I think in 2021, there will be a credit card-sized computer

53:37.080 --> 53:40.080
with a full-fledged RISC-V CPU.

53:40.080 --> 53:42.040
Oh, I like that one.

53:42.040 --> 53:42.920
That's a good one.

53:42.920 --> 53:43.200
All right.

53:43.200 --> 53:45.640
I'm going to keep moving because we've got more,

53:45.640 --> 53:47.240
but we will have the post-show as well.

53:47.240 --> 53:48.760
JJ, get yours in.

53:48.760 --> 53:52.240
I predict that in 2021, streaming DRM

53:52.240 --> 53:56.240
will restrict users on Linux from enjoying content.

54:00.400 --> 54:01.320
I hope not.

54:01.320 --> 54:04.560
That would be a fail.

54:04.560 --> 54:06.680
Jeff, you've got a silver-blue prediction.

54:06.680 --> 54:12.240
Yeah, I predict that I will deploy Fedora's silver-blue

54:12.240 --> 54:17.840
on mostly home-built ThinkPads to all my customers who want it,

54:17.840 --> 54:20.280
and I'll make a profit for the first time.

54:20.280 --> 54:21.360
I mean, it's impossible.

54:21.360 --> 54:23.840
You all know I'm not going to make a profit on the hardware.

54:23.840 --> 54:24.560
That's impossible.

54:24.560 --> 54:25.360
We all know that.

54:25.360 --> 54:28.160
But I actually believe I can actually

54:28.160 --> 54:32.080
support silver-blue all over the world if I need to.

54:32.080 --> 54:34.920
I can just FedEx from a new box when it breaks,

54:34.920 --> 54:36.480
just like the enterprise guys do.

54:36.480 --> 54:38.440
And they can call the helpline.

54:38.440 --> 54:40.080
So I need to go official, I guess.

54:40.080 --> 54:40.760
What do you all think?

54:40.760 --> 54:42.120
Have you all tried silver-blue?

54:42.120 --> 54:42.440
Yes.

54:42.440 --> 54:44.080
Well, Drew has talked about it too little bit on the show.

54:44.080 --> 54:45.360
I hope that works out for you.

54:45.360 --> 54:47.280
I think that's a good prediction.

54:47.280 --> 54:49.760
And then, Colonel, you have a PinePhone prediction.

54:49.760 --> 54:50.260
Yep.

54:50.260 --> 54:54.400
So my prediction is that sometime in 2021,

54:54.400 --> 54:56.920
one of the software distros for the PinePhone

54:56.920 --> 54:59.680
will become daily driver ready.

54:59.680 --> 55:02.120
So for daily driver, what do we define that as?

55:02.120 --> 55:04.200
Has that navigation and what?

55:04.200 --> 55:05.280
Like, what's daily driver?

55:05.280 --> 55:07.840
Or could Chris stand to use it for a week?

55:07.840 --> 55:08.960
Let's not kid ourselves.

55:08.960 --> 55:10.160
Come on.

55:10.160 --> 55:11.680
Let's not.

55:11.680 --> 55:15.880
If the PinePhone is installed and set up,

55:15.880 --> 55:18.280
somebody who's not a complete and total nerd

55:18.280 --> 55:22.280
can use it day-to-day for phone calls, text messages,

55:22.280 --> 55:24.160
and some web browsing.

55:24.160 --> 55:24.660
All right.

55:24.660 --> 55:25.520
I like it.

55:25.520 --> 55:27.240
If you're listening to this and thinking,

55:27.240 --> 55:28.280
gosh, I'd like to get a prediction

55:28.280 --> 55:30.000
and I've got a good one, let us know.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.160
Go to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

55:32.160 --> 55:33.520
Over the next few episodes, we'll

55:33.520 --> 55:35.320
read a few more 2021 predictions.

55:35.320 --> 55:37.480
Because let's be honest, it's still pretty early in the game.

55:37.480 --> 55:39.960
So it'll still count if you get it in January via email.

55:39.960 --> 55:41.020
Wouldn't that be neat?

55:41.020 --> 55:42.360
Maybe you got a good one in you.

55:42.360 --> 55:45.000
So that's linuxunplug.com slash contact.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.400
You can find our sponsor, A Cloud Guru, on social media.

55:47.400 --> 55:48.200
It's really simple.

55:48.200 --> 55:50.920
You just go to slash acloudguru at YouTube, Twitter,

55:50.920 --> 55:52.020
or Facebook.

55:52.020 --> 55:53.080
All of that is there.

55:53.080 --> 55:54.960
Links to subscribe or find.

55:54.960 --> 55:56.360
Usually, we have a bunch of links

55:56.360 --> 55:59.040
to stuff we talked about, but this is a special episode.

55:59.040 --> 56:01.420
But generally, you can find our show note links and everything

56:01.420 --> 56:03.220
like that at that Linux Unplugged website.

56:03.220 --> 56:04.920
It's really quite simple.

56:04.920 --> 56:07.400
And then, of course, we'd love to have you join us live.

56:07.400 --> 56:11.880
We do this show on Tuesdays at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

56:11.880 --> 56:13.160
See you next week.

56:13.160 --> 56:15.880
Same bad time, same bad station.

56:15.880 --> 56:17.300
And there is a lot to it.

56:17.300 --> 56:20.320
You can join our Mumble Room and hang out in our virtual Lug.

56:20.320 --> 56:23.760
Of course, we also have the LUP Lug on Sundays.

56:23.760 --> 56:25.400
So you set up the Mumble Room once.

56:25.400 --> 56:27.720
You get access to the show and the LUP Lug on Sundays.

56:27.720 --> 56:28.800
It's pretty great.

56:28.800 --> 56:30.360
All this stuff that we do live, it's

56:30.360 --> 56:32.680
at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

56:32.680 --> 56:34.720
But last but not least, let me just say,

56:34.720 --> 56:36.640
here's to a great 2021.

56:36.640 --> 56:37.760
Thank you for listening.

56:37.760 --> 56:40.160
We appreciate everyone who downloads or shares

56:40.160 --> 56:43.840
this show, all of our core contributors, all of you.

56:43.840 --> 56:47.000
Hope you have a great 2021, and we'll see you right back here.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
Not next Tuesday.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.120
No, my friends.

56:49.120 --> 56:52.120
If you can believe it, we'll see you right back here.

56:52.120 --> 56:54.040
Next frickin' year!

56:54.040 --> 56:55.240
Come on, everybody, next year!

56:55.240 --> 56:56.240
Happy new year!

56:56.240 --> 56:57.240
Happy new year!

56:57.240 --> 56:58.240
Happy new year!

56:58.240 --> 57:00.240
Happy new year!

57:00.240 --> 57:04.240
Happy new year!

57:04.240 --> 57:08.240
Happy new year!

57:08.240 --> 57:13.240
Happy new year!

57:13.240 --> 57:16.240
Happy new year!

57:16.240 --> 57:18.200
Happy new year!

57:18.200 --> 57:20.200
Happy new year!

57:20.200 --> 57:22.220
Happy new year!

57:22.220 --> 57:25.240
Happy New Year!

57:25.240 --> 57:28.220
Happy new year!

57:28.220 --> 57:30.220
You
