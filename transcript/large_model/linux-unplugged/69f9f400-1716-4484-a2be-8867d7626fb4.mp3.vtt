WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
I do have one topic we could warm up with before we start. Oh, did you see the populous chip the populous?

00:06.080 --> 00:07.500
It's 3d

00:07.500 --> 00:09.500
VR for everyone for only

00:09.840 --> 00:16.260
$49 that's my kind of price. I can't I can't really I can't really I can't I just you know what?

00:16.260 --> 00:20.880
I can't and by the way this picture headset not included some 3d printing required

00:20.880 --> 00:26.640
Yeah, so there's a there's a picture of the pocket because backed up to this thing and there's even a video although

00:26.640 --> 00:34.560
This combined emulator package so that we can get virtual boy running on

00:36.400 --> 00:39.120
So you're familiar with the pocket chip device, right?

00:39.840 --> 00:46.000
Things awesome. Yeah, and then they came up with a 3d printed VR headset that goes over the pocket chip screen and

00:47.160 --> 00:49.080
Yeah

00:49.080 --> 00:52.480
This is awesome virtual boy games in 3d

00:52.480 --> 00:56.960
This look at that. It's actually kind of cool. It's kind of cool. I

00:58.680 --> 01:00.680
Don't know that I'm about to buy one

01:00.840 --> 01:02.560
Make one but it is cool

01:02.560 --> 01:07.000
You know if I had the pocket I might that if I had the pocket you think that is actually so cool

01:07.000 --> 01:13.040
Do you remember how red it was? Yeah, I know. Oh man, bring back the real the original VR. It's 3d

01:14.840 --> 01:16.840
It actually is

01:16.840 --> 01:24.840
It's amazing. Yeah, there's like 30 virtual board games. Yeah, that's water world Kevin Costner's water world

01:26.120 --> 01:28.120
I haven't thought about water world for ages

01:29.280 --> 01:31.280
This is Linux unplugged episode

01:32.280 --> 01:34.280
154 for July 19th

01:34.880 --> 01:36.880
2016

01:36.880 --> 01:38.880
Oh

01:46.560 --> 01:51.960
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's on the ground and reporting from the Linux trenches

01:52.000 --> 01:57.400
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes and Losa big show today for 154

01:57.400 --> 02:03.240
It's something we do just for all 154 additions of our podcast. We just do big shows. That's what we do

02:03.240 --> 02:09.280
It's huge tradition coming up on this week's episode of the show. There's a big big release coming out for Linux

02:09.280 --> 02:12.420
We'll give you the details on that. It was actually crowdfunded, which is pretty neat

02:12.420 --> 02:15.740
I've got some follow-up on some stories we covered last week

02:15.740 --> 02:23.000
There's some shenanigans going on that I think may just tip snaps over the top. Yeah, we'll tell you about that why snaps wolf

02:24.200 --> 02:25.400
dominate

02:25.400 --> 02:27.280
Then later up later on the show

02:27.280 --> 02:29.000
I'm gonna do a little follow-up on

02:29.000 --> 02:34.500
My VPN efforts what I landed on and then we'll get into a discussion about self hosting

02:34.500 --> 02:35.760
Oh and

02:35.760 --> 02:40.220
It's actually kind of an interesting discussion because it West has a little angle on there that we'll talk about as well

02:40.220 --> 02:45.400
And then later on in the show towards the end. I think this one will probably get the virtual log going the most

02:46.520 --> 02:53.360
Do you use the Linux desktop for idealistic or practical reasons and what brought you here and what keeps you?

02:53.440 --> 02:56.200
We'll talk about that coming up towards the end of the show

02:56.200 --> 03:01.320
But before all of that stuff we got a bunch of open-source

03:01.760 --> 03:06.420
Project updates to get into like we do and every single on plug show lots of stuff and projects

03:06.420 --> 03:12.540
We're following every single week that we want to tell you about news items things that impact Linux users things that our virtual lug

03:12.640 --> 03:18.640
Could dig into so why don't we start there speaking of that? Let's bring in that log time appropriate greetings virtual look

03:18.640 --> 03:21.640
I

03:23.600 --> 03:28.520
Hello it is good to see you so let's start with a story that's been grabbing attention all week long

03:28.520 --> 03:33.960
I didn't cover it in laughs, but I thought you know by now everybody seen it. It's the elephant in the room

03:34.800 --> 03:38.360
Microsoft is blocking Linux installations on old hardware

03:39.640 --> 03:42.600
So Wes if I'm grokking this story correctly

03:42.600 --> 03:48.680
An update went out to the now essentially defunct Windows RT that closed

03:49.520 --> 03:56.000
Essentially a backdoor that you could use to install alternative operating systems on the Windows RT tablet

03:56.000 --> 04:00.680
Am I am I following this? Yeah, that's what it sounds like so like on Microsoft's way out the door. They're like alright

04:00.680 --> 04:04.200
Well, thanks for buying that hardware now that we're done with it install this update

04:04.200 --> 04:08.920
And then you install that update and your host and you never have any fun again

04:08.920 --> 04:11.120
And it was something Microsoft had known about the entire time

04:11.120 --> 04:17.080
It was something they seemed to intentionally left had left open and then they're like ah see ya right

04:17.200 --> 04:20.280
Thanks for all the it seems just what's the benefit to that?

04:20.280 --> 04:23.200
I mean I could see them have done it at the first right that's what they were going to do

04:23.200 --> 04:28.120
They're gonna be like hey lock it down not on our arm platforms. No. It's you know secure boot all the way

04:28.120 --> 04:33.840
No key new keys, but when you're abandoning a platform when you're like yeah, sorry you made the wrong choice see ya

04:35.040 --> 04:40.520
That seems like the last thing you should do is make it basically unusable for anything useful after that yeah

04:40.520 --> 04:45.120
Um and I must have been I wonder if there was like an enterprise pressure or some some thing

04:45.120 --> 04:47.440
That's like they're there. They were actually using that platform

04:48.320 --> 04:55.120
Yeah, that's a great question. Are they gonna continue to support it so therefore they're trying to reduce the surface area of problems

04:55.560 --> 05:00.120
Get it surface area problems, especially if this is like become more known or something you know where it's like well

05:00.120 --> 05:04.600
We really can't maybe we're not meeting the contracts or like we said that this was a secure tablet or whatever

05:05.000 --> 05:08.500
But like ww saying you you get the sense that

05:08.500 --> 05:11.060
This is sort of Microsoft

05:11.660 --> 05:13.660
Of yesteryear right ww

05:14.460 --> 05:17.900
Yeah, kind of like hey, you know things for all the money

05:18.340 --> 05:24.500
No, you get no support or or nothing on this or you know maybe maybe we'll support Linux

05:24.500 --> 05:27.500
You know we got this as yours thing. You know yeah

05:27.500 --> 05:34.260
I think what ww is saying there is why he got so much traction is hey what happened to heart in Linux exactly?

05:34.260 --> 05:36.100
What happened to emoji heart?

05:36.100 --> 05:39.620
What happened because really this just goes to block Linux?

05:39.620 --> 05:42.420
I mean anything that's gonna be used at scale would be Linux installations and

05:43.060 --> 05:49.260
The fact people talk about here that there is actually a couple of popular installations on RT

05:49.260 --> 05:54.620
Tablets so I guess if you want to saw Linux on an RT tablet don't install the latest update yeah

05:54.820 --> 05:57.320
which is sort of I I I

05:57.900 --> 06:04.140
Don't feel like this one story is a clear indicator of a Microsoft as a whole's intention towards Linux

06:04.140 --> 06:09.340
And it's not important enough of a platform to really reflect their core values probably right

06:09.860 --> 06:13.940
You know what would you know would really you know would really sell it for me

06:14.700 --> 06:18.140
What's that is it called the surface book that really crazy expensive? Yeah?

06:18.860 --> 06:20.860
And I know this would never happen

06:21.060 --> 06:26.020
But man you know it would shut me up immediately about Microsoft and how much they support Linux if they shipped a version of that

06:26.020 --> 06:31.340
With Ubuntu LTS that would be crazy right and had maybe and let's just since it's Microsoft

06:31.340 --> 06:36.060
We'll just give on a few things the web browsers pre-configured to use being yep

06:36.060 --> 06:40.060
Oh naturally you got Skype for Linux installed. You can use the Etsy scale for that Chris

06:42.460 --> 06:45.900
Also you have like Visual Studio code pre-installed

06:46.460 --> 06:51.140
You know so you have like the Microsoft Linux tool sets preloaded ready to

06:52.140 --> 06:57.460
Dev net right on your Ubuntu. Oh man, then I would be then I would be

06:58.380 --> 07:00.380
Really like okay this clear indicator

07:00.380 --> 07:01.540
I

07:01.540 --> 07:08.340
Guess I'd like to hear from you many. What do you think you think this is an indicator of Microsoft's overall intention or perhaps?

07:09.060 --> 07:11.260
This is just a bug fix gone wrong I

07:12.380 --> 07:20.460
Mean you can't blame Microsoft for fixing a bug a big step would be to open the way few devices on these RT devices

07:20.460 --> 07:29.660
So anyone who wants to install in this can install it, but just fix a bug is what Microsoft has to do oh

07:31.380 --> 07:35.820
I kind of like land rashes theory though land rash go ahead you have a theory that maybe this is

07:36.420 --> 07:38.420
Sort of a competitive move

07:38.580 --> 07:40.580
Well, it's good practice not to have

07:41.660 --> 07:46.580
Competition against your own product, and if you don't if you disable the ability to install Linux

07:46.580 --> 07:52.580
I maybe people be more encouraged to buy newer hardware because they're not getting the same value wouldn't those just be pissed off customers

07:52.580 --> 07:54.580
That just wouldn't buy another surface

07:54.620 --> 07:58.100
Well, you'll have a few pissed off customers, but a lot of paying customers

07:59.180 --> 08:04.660
Hmm yeah, okay, I guess that's better than none huh it's just such weird timing. Yeah, it's like if they've done it around

08:04.660 --> 08:10.180
I don't know if they've done it earlier if they've done it from the start like they kind of said that they were going to

08:10.180 --> 08:13.020
Yeah, you know API in the chat rooms pointed out

08:13.020 --> 08:18.820
And we just did some coverage over the last couple episodes of tech snap there is a 20 year old printer spooler bug in Windows

08:18.900 --> 08:20.900
That is exploitable remotely

08:20.900 --> 08:27.780
And it's just it's really something and that is so that's we covered that in the last two weeks because it's a story that evolved

08:27.780 --> 08:32.740
In tech snap and then the week before that we talked about a group policy disaster that no yeah

08:32.740 --> 08:36.720
That was an interesting yeah, it turned off group policy Network. Why and he just Windows is

08:37.460 --> 08:42.980
Yeah, it's time to ship up went to on that on that surface book so speaking of things that are shipping

08:42.980 --> 08:46.900
Maybe this is why they are worried about Linux. There is a game

08:47.500 --> 08:52.980
That you may have heard of you may even have you may even have fond memory memories of system shock

08:53.220 --> 08:55.940
Which is a game that came out damn near?

08:55.940 --> 08:57.900
I don't know 23 years ago now

08:57.900 --> 09:04.420
It's a triple-a title and after two decades night dive studios is rebooting and reimagining the original system shock

09:04.580 --> 09:09.180
with a new game that they say is true to the classic experience, and I've read some reviews to say it is and

09:09.180 --> 09:13.420
I hadn't talked about this before because it was a Kickstarter

09:13.420 --> 09:17.860
And it wasn't it was one of those where they sort of teased Linux support

09:17.860 --> 09:23.440
Yeah, and they didn't promise Linux support. We've been burned there before yeah, and so here's a little bit of the Kickstarter

09:23.620 --> 09:25.180
I'll play a little bit of this for you

09:25.180 --> 09:28.860
So you kind of get a feel there they seem like a pretty fun bunch where it all began it says

09:28.860 --> 09:30.860
I love to play outside with all the other children

09:31.060 --> 09:33.060
until the incident

09:33.060 --> 09:35.060
It was like night and day

09:35.060 --> 09:37.060
after he started playing that

09:37.060 --> 09:38.940
classic cyberpunk

09:38.940 --> 09:41.020
horror video game system shock

09:41.700 --> 09:43.380
he simply

09:43.380 --> 09:45.380
lost touch with reality

09:47.780 --> 09:52.500
So this is it's a really fun parody video and in it they say well

09:52.500 --> 09:55.500
You know they talk about re reimagining this game

09:55.500 --> 09:58.940
And they say how they talk they just talk and talk and talk about how much they love this old game

09:58.940 --> 10:03.260
And they promised a Linux version if they got to a certain amount on the Linux community said great

10:03.260 --> 10:09.620
Prove it. We're not just gonna. Maybe kick in and have you not reach your end goal so today

10:10.380 --> 10:14.920
The guys behind system sock at shock and gals said alright. Well. We will prove it

10:14.920 --> 10:19.820
We will ship a Linux demo to prove to you that we can hit the export button in unity and

10:20.260 --> 10:27.060
Make a Linux version so they ship that today. I download it from gog.com. It's free. I think you can also get it on Steam and

10:27.980 --> 10:30.760
It is freaking great, dude

10:30.760 --> 10:35.360
So this is this is a video of the trailer here awesome. It is awesome

10:45.440 --> 10:49.320
There's a very cool vibe to it mm-hmm and I

10:51.080 --> 10:56.360
Tell you what the the game is so damn great that I think I'm gonna go back at the the project after

10:56.360 --> 11:02.000
After the show so they're they're they're almost there now to get to get Linux support

11:02.000 --> 11:06.680
They've proved that they can hit the export button, so I think that's probably worth backing them. Yeah, that's awesome

11:06.680 --> 11:11.060
Yeah, they now here's what they say they said due to popular demand they put up the Linux demo

11:11.400 --> 11:14.760
We're doing this before we hit the stretch goal as a gesture of good faith

11:14.760 --> 11:19.480
But understand that the Linux demo does not guarantee a Linux version of the final game unless we hit the stretch goal

11:19.480 --> 11:25.560
It took quite a bit of time to get all working on Linux as well as a bit of internal testing. I like that

11:25.560 --> 11:29.660
Oh, oh a bit a bit of internal testing sounds like more than a bit

11:30.600 --> 11:35.940
Launching on other platforms takes time to adequately support and deploy which is why we have a stretch goal, and it is vital

11:37.240 --> 11:39.840
Okay, they also far away. Are we from that stretch goal right now?

11:39.880 --> 11:44.160
They talk also by the way they talk about have you to have to install lib sdl2 for the audio to work correctly

11:44.160 --> 11:46.000
I see let's see

11:46.000 --> 11:52.140
If I recall something it's like they're like they're like 15,000 away from it right now or 16,000 away from it

11:52.140 --> 11:56.480
But I don't they don't just come right out and say in the post how much money they need they have like this graphic here

11:56.480 --> 11:59.640
You have to follow but from what the tech tree. Yeah from the breakdown

11:59.640 --> 12:04.620
I have in fact, I think Liam has over on gaming on linux.com. He even breaks it down to he says

12:06.000 --> 12:13.800
Yeah, I needed to get around 63,000 to hit the stretch goal and right now it is at us. Oh

12:15.320 --> 12:21.320
Oh, it doesn't need another 63,000. That's what it needs another 63 thousands. There you go. Well Linux gamers out there

12:21.320 --> 12:24.280
Yeah, see what we can do. Yeah, actually I think they're gonna make it

12:24.280 --> 12:26.000
I think they hit a million so I think they're gonna make it now

12:26.000 --> 12:27.160
So I think that's gonna be awesome

12:27.160 --> 12:32.600
I look forward to it and the great thing about the demo is if you just want to play around it's free and it's hosted

12:32.600 --> 12:37.520
Right up on the gog.com for direct download. Wow. Yeah, that is a very good good faith effort

12:37.520 --> 12:42.740
It's nice after being burned by look at that. Look at that screenshot there West with the with the planetary rings out the window

12:42.960 --> 12:48.560
Holy smokes that my heart is a flutter. Yeah, and it's nice to have to get burned by Kickstarter a few times

12:48.560 --> 12:51.000
Oh, yeah to see that. So anyways

12:51.560 --> 12:56.880
The system shock demo is out. I downloaded on my machine upstairs. I didn't have a little audio problems little audio glitch

12:56.880 --> 12:58.880
I heard sounds, but they're still like this

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Yeah, so not quite there

13:01.880 --> 13:08.280
Their first stretch goal is 1.1 million. Okay, and they're 1 million right now. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you

13:08.280 --> 13:11.160
Yeah, they don't make it super obvious cuz it's all like in that graphic

13:11.280 --> 13:16.720
And I think I'll probably back him after the show just because I would probably buy that game on Steam anyways after it comes out

13:16.720 --> 13:20.920
And if they're so damn close, I wouldn't mind pushing them over. Yeah, okay

13:20.920 --> 13:24.440
So I'll cyber seal in the chat room says it is available on Steam as well for free

13:24.440 --> 13:28.840
Oh nice sure you can get that speaking of something else you could try out for free that be digital ocean

13:28.840 --> 13:32.800
In fact, if you use our promo code do unplugged all one word and that's lowercase

13:32.800 --> 13:36.280
You can get a $10 credit over digital ocean comm simple cloud hosting provider

13:36.720 --> 13:41.800
Dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin up your own rig on their super badass infrastructure

13:42.080 --> 13:45.480
SSDs top to bottom 40 gigabyte connections of the hypervisor

13:45.480 --> 13:50.280
The hypervisor is KVM running on top of Linux already kick up. Oh son

13:50.840 --> 13:53.080
Yeah, you can tell too like when you're downloading software

13:53.080 --> 13:59.240
One of the other things they do that I just love is they have a private networking option that goes over their own internal networking

13:59.240 --> 14:03.680
Doesn't count against your transfer. It's a great way to proxy connections to machines behind you

14:03.680 --> 14:07.440
Or if you need to set up something to do like file storage, it's awesome

14:07.440 --> 14:12.480
They have snapshots and backups that make taking point-in-time snapshots snapshots of your machine before you go cray-cray

14:12.480 --> 14:19.520
Super easy the straightforward API makes that all super automatable, but let me tell you something girl that that interface

14:19.520 --> 14:21.520
Oh that interface is nice

14:21.600 --> 14:26.240
The way that they've been able to evolve it to and not add unnecessary complexity or buttons

14:26.240 --> 14:31.640
It's really something the KDE project should look at go over use the promo code do unplugged

14:31.640 --> 14:36.040
You'll get a $10 credit and in less than 55 seconds. You can get your own digital ocean rig spun up

14:36.040 --> 14:42.840
They have Ubuntu LTS is of course infecting even when that's a non LTS release. They have the most current version in there

14:42.840 --> 14:48.520
They got FreeBSD Fedora Debian core OS and sent OS core OS is a pretty awesome concept

14:48.520 --> 14:51.680
Have you played around with it? I know you're a container guy. It's pretty cool

14:51.680 --> 14:56.200
Yeah, but you just you're just a straight-up like LTS with Alex de you don't need no core OS, right?

14:56.200 --> 14:58.560
I do think it's a pretty cool project. It is super cool

14:58.560 --> 15:00.560
very interesting and I appreciate how much like

15:00.560 --> 15:05.440
diversity and other tooling and kind of different take they've they brought to the Docker ecosystem and

15:05.960 --> 15:11.480
Yeah with rocket. Yeah, and plus they're just super good. They're super super sound voices in that space

15:11.480 --> 15:14.120
Yeah, they have a lot of good engineers bringing a lot of like

15:15.000 --> 15:16.080
etcd is really cool

15:16.080 --> 15:20.800
Yes, like a lot of really good software for distributed configurations that way and digital ocean

15:20.800 --> 15:22.960
Which is really cool is they work right upstream with core OS

15:22.960 --> 15:25.340
So that way you either they're in one of the release channels

15:25.340 --> 15:27.800
They get official updates from core OS and by the way

15:27.800 --> 15:33.160
They just launched their new block storage where you can attach up to 16 terabytes of SSD storage

15:34.200 --> 15:36.200
whoa

15:36.200 --> 15:40.480
Whoa do unplugged when you check out or actually what you do. It's not when you check out

15:40.480 --> 15:42.640
It's in the account you go when you're doing your payment area

15:42.640 --> 15:46.240
You just apply it and you get a $10 credit and you can run that you can run a rig for a while

15:46.440 --> 15:50.320
Do unplugged and a big thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program

15:50.320 --> 15:56.160
I want to do a little bit of follow-up because I realize not everyone watches Linux action show that watches this show and I've been

15:56.160 --> 16:01.080
Getting a lot of tweets about this still or I'm not not not tweets emails. I wish I was getting tweets

16:01.200 --> 16:06.500
She's Louise at Chris LAS telling you if if you don't hear from me an email you ping me on Twitter

16:06.500 --> 16:07.440
You might get me

16:07.440 --> 16:09.920
But just don't don't tweet me ask me to read your email

16:10.720 --> 16:17.880
That never makes sense so this bug has bit me and I talked a little bit about it last week the update to 4.6

16:17.880 --> 16:20.360
4 it drove you off of it was otherwise a fedora

16:20.360 --> 16:25.960
Yeah, turns out there was a microcode bug in that package and because of that

16:26.560 --> 16:33.040
The kernel update fails after after you do the update the microcode package fails to update and it doesn't boot

16:33.880 --> 16:37.800
Major bummer and it's been it's been hitting people with sky like machines

16:37.840 --> 16:40.160
So I just want to do a quick follow-up right here

16:40.160 --> 16:43.200
I have linked to the show notes the fedora bug where they're tracking it

16:43.320 --> 16:47.760
there is a kind of a workaround you could do if this particular issues hit you I've heard from a few people that where they

16:47.760 --> 16:49.760
have and I

16:49.760 --> 16:53.560
Said this on the show Wes and I just want to sort of double down on the statement here

16:53.560 --> 16:56.920
But it's guy like has been a major disappointment for really has been you know

16:56.920 --> 16:58.480
Especially since we've like we've talked about it

16:58.480 --> 17:02.800
You hear a lot about just how good Intel is at working with the kernel supposedly, right?

17:03.160 --> 17:07.600
But it seems to have been a major pain point, especially since it was kind of like it seemed like a an architecture

17:07.600 --> 17:12.240
They were kind of excited for as a company and we've heard a lot about new sky like laptops and yeah

17:12.240 --> 17:14.560
Yeah, and I remember when 1604 came out

17:16.720 --> 17:18.480
They

17:18.480 --> 17:24.200
They had that graphics flashing issue and it bit Michael Dominic and he ended up bailing into bailing from it

17:24.200 --> 17:27.560
Oh, wow. Yeah, and that was sort of like I was a moment where I was like, okay

17:27.560 --> 17:32.480
So there's one user lost but all right. All right. Okay. Sorry. Sorry Michael is really I promise

17:32.480 --> 17:33.680
It's better next time you try it

17:33.680 --> 17:40.080
I want to talk about something really quickly that I thought was an interesting development and I it really kind of came to my attention

17:40.480 --> 17:46.600
When I saw a tweet this week that see do I have the tweet up here? Yeah, here it is

17:46.600 --> 17:47.640
in

17:47.640 --> 17:54.440
Other news your Chrome browsing data will soon be used for ad tailoring time to act surprised I guess and

17:54.880 --> 17:59.440
This is something that you don't even really know about until you go into review your Google account settings

17:59.440 --> 18:04.040
And I noticed Google was prompting me to review my account settings. I was like, why is it and I went in there?

18:04.040 --> 18:10.180
I didn't see anything. It's not obvious. I didn't read the fine print, right? But if you read the fine print it says

18:10.180 --> 18:16.180
When you use Google services like search in YouTube you generate data things like what you've searched for and videos you've watched you can find

18:16.180 --> 18:21.380
And control that data in my account under the web and app activity setting with this change

18:21.700 --> 18:28.180
This setting may also include browsing data from Chrome and activity from sites and apps that partner with Google

18:28.740 --> 18:32.580
including those that show ads from Google which is a

18:32.580 --> 18:39.580
I mean just that whole P apps the partner with Google that's probably apps that use the Google sign-in and apps that use advertising

18:39.580 --> 18:44.580
Holy she's makes me wonder about like, you know, when will this present like a conflict of interest for like

18:46.580 --> 18:51.220
Or like a big enterprise where suddenly I mean we already knew like everything you you know, you type in that little bar

18:51.220 --> 18:55.380
It's getting sent to their servers, but yeah, I use Chrome at work and I can sort of security policies

18:55.380 --> 18:58.020
That would be less than happy right? Yeah, you know, that's good point

18:58.020 --> 19:02.780
I was sniffing around trying to get a sense of what it is that Chrome is sending back to Google that they will use for

19:02.780 --> 19:04.820
Advertising this is probably not a complete list

19:04.820 --> 19:07.460
But here's some of the things and I put these in the show notes that I came across

19:07.780 --> 19:14.740
People who sign into Chrome then you are opted into this people who use opt-out services like use a web service to help resolve

19:14.740 --> 19:17.740
Navigation errors use prediction service to help complete searches

19:17.740 --> 19:24.740
You know that search thing that gets you using a prediction service to load pages more quickly automatically reporting details of possibly

19:24.740 --> 19:29.460
Possible insecure pages to Google protecting your site and devices from dangerous sites

19:29.460 --> 19:32.260
If you you know when you get that pop-up says the site might be dangerous

19:32.660 --> 19:37.540
Automatically sending usage and crash reports to Google opting into all of those things

19:37.540 --> 19:43.540
They will use that data based on they will use that data for advertising and this is so obvious

19:43.540 --> 19:50.100
Right. I mean like yeah, I mean, I can't even I can't even I can't even vain that I'm surprised I can't but

19:50.740 --> 19:52.740
It's so disappointing

19:52.740 --> 19:58.100
It's so disappointing. It's so freaking disappointing and and what it shows you is

19:59.460 --> 20:02.260
This was in this this was the end goal all along, right?

20:02.260 --> 20:08.500
This is why they they launched a web browser to have a say in web standards and to do this thing exactly

20:08.500 --> 20:10.740
This is why an advertising company creates a web browser

20:10.740 --> 20:11.180
Yep

20:11.180 --> 20:16.500
And I I kind of had a sense of what's going on because I noticed things that I had typed in Chrome were showing up in

20:16.500 --> 20:20.380
My Google now cards, so I had a sense. Oh, yeah, absolutely. They were parsing that sometimes. It's nice

20:20.380 --> 20:24.020
I'll say Google now has shown me some stories. I wanted to see oh for sure. Yeah

20:24.700 --> 20:28.700
A but they're just not so public about it. What was that news?

20:29.860 --> 20:34.980
Combined with this neat script that came out this week. I'm thinking about making a change

20:34.980 --> 20:38.800
It's not a dramatic change. But one of the things has prevented me from trying out Vivaldi

20:38.860 --> 20:42.380
We've talked to the developers on this show. I've done a quick take on it before

20:43.140 --> 20:48.140
But at the end of the day Wes, I'm not gonna lie. I do like to be able to watch Netflix

20:48.140 --> 20:50.940
I'm gonna start track to watch, you know, you nailed it

20:50.940 --> 20:57.180
And so that's why I'm super excited about this new script that enables playback in Vivaldi and other

20:57.500 --> 21:00.380
Chromium based web browsers including chromium itself

21:00.580 --> 21:06.740
So this is super nice of all the project guy has managed to create a handy script that allow you to do this and I've linked

21:06.740 --> 21:11.660
It in the show notes. I've tried it out. It does work. It's just it's a gist that you download

21:11.700 --> 21:16.100
it's also in the AUR and one of the neat things about the AUR version is they have a

21:16.100 --> 21:18.100
Vivaldi specific one and

21:18.780 --> 21:25.140
Then they have a chromium specific one that works for Vivaldi and all of them and the Vivaldi specific one has less dependencies the

21:25.500 --> 21:31.740
The chromium based one downloads like 150 megabytes of packages, which took forever on my Wi-Fi connection

21:31.860 --> 21:34.420
But I'll tell you what at the end of it

21:34.420 --> 21:40.140
I was able to watch Netflix in Vivaldi and I can install some of the same Chrome extensions that I kind of need to do

21:40.140 --> 21:41.980
the the show notes

21:41.980 --> 21:46.740
So hey, and you know what else in my limited use it felt like it loads faster

21:46.740 --> 21:49.700
The other thing I like about it is it has better

21:50.580 --> 21:56.820
Display of page loading like I have bar that has it tells you your transfer rate of how fast the web pages downloading

21:56.820 --> 22:00.680
So like old web browsers used to and each tab has progress indicators

22:00.680 --> 22:02.660
It feels a little faster, you know

22:02.660 --> 22:05.640
And I did enjoy using I had it on my laptop for a while when we first talked about it

22:05.640 --> 22:11.580
It's definitely not a bad browser and they've recently introduced something that I know you have bolted onto Chrome

22:11.580 --> 22:14.700
in their latest version of the Vivaldi if I'm saying that right is

22:16.340 --> 22:20.620
Tab hibernation. Yeah, definitely and I don't I don't reuse it myself

22:20.620 --> 22:26.220
But my understanding of tab hibernation is that it has an ability to sense how long a tab has been inactive and once it reaches

22:26.220 --> 22:28.180
that threshold it essentially

22:28.180 --> 22:32.220
Pauses anything on that like it doesn't render that page anymore. It might yeah, you know

22:32.220 --> 22:34.820
I don't know the exact implementations of the Vivaldi version

22:34.820 --> 22:38.660
But the the great suspender is the extension I use in Chrome and yeah

22:38.660 --> 22:43.340
It'll just basically changes the URL to the URL of the extension plus

22:43.580 --> 22:47.820
The page you were on and then you click like so the extension basically takes over the tab

22:48.080 --> 22:49.620
Using much less memory than you know

22:49.620 --> 22:54.860
A full rendered dom page and all that and then you just give it a click and then it the extension then just reloads the page

22:54.860 --> 23:00.700
That was there. So if there's any animation of any kind or anything that all passes, you know, it doesn't preserve state

23:00.940 --> 23:06.940
It just preserves like where you what page it was what and that's good. I suppose if you had a lot of tabs

23:06.940 --> 23:08.940
Yes, yeah, exactly or like, you know

23:08.940 --> 23:13.020
Like you're doing some research for the show perhaps and there's a lot of times where it's like well

23:13.020 --> 23:15.820
I have a whole stack of tabs and maybe I need ten of them right now

23:15.820 --> 23:17.100
But I'm gonna do the next one

23:17.100 --> 23:22.100
30 minutes later, especially if you're a laptop and so you're releasing probably way more than half the RAM each one of those tabs takes

23:22.100 --> 23:27.460
At that point. Yeah, exactly. I mean I would did you know so when it does that does it also unload all of the extensions?

23:27.460 --> 23:28.660
Cuz you know each

23:28.660 --> 23:30.860
Instance of the extent question. Yes. I don't I don't know

23:30.980 --> 23:33.700
Anyways, that's interesting and they've built it into Vivaldi

23:33.700 --> 23:37.540
Yeah, which is kind of compelling from a from a laptop battery saving standpoint

23:37.900 --> 23:42.900
So I think over the next week I'm gonna transition to that browser and see how it works for me

23:42.900 --> 23:47.700
I have it loaded upstairs on my machine already. Awesome, and I did the chromium

23:49.260 --> 23:54.820
Script that allowed me to install Netflix for all chromium based browsers looks like a pretty reasonable script here, too

23:54.820 --> 23:59.460
Like it's I mean, it's only hundred lines long. You can easily parse it. Yes. It's not crazy

23:59.460 --> 24:04.820
Yeah, it's not crazy and it's it was made by one of the team members to just enable it because this was a total thing

24:04.820 --> 24:08.060
That they needed fixed on their browser and it seems like a pretty good like good that you know

24:08.060 --> 24:12.860
They didn't just bake it into theirs and not share with the community. It's like that's kind of a nice guy thing

24:12.860 --> 24:19.020
Yeah, so, you know what they do is they take chromium and they and they rebase off of chromium and in some cases they've done

24:19.660 --> 24:25.260
They've walked this line of a it feels like they look at the Chrome extension market and they go

24:25.260 --> 24:31.060
Well, those four things are a really good idea. Let's bake that in and I don't know exactly if they

24:31.280 --> 24:37.040
Reimplemented or if they work with those authors or what but they've managed to do it in such a way that the UI still seems

24:37.040 --> 24:39.840
very responsive the browser seems really responsive and

24:40.320 --> 24:44.880
It's for me. It's easier to navigate than Chrome itself in terms of settings

24:45.280 --> 24:52.160
So you click on the Vivaldi menu and you just have a traditional file edit view tools menu instead of a hamburger

24:52.160 --> 24:56.160
and when you click on settings us you can change this it can be a tab but a

24:56.240 --> 25:03.320
Separate dialogue with with hierarchical settings comes up that is much easier to navigate than in Chrome's huge long list of settings

25:03.320 --> 25:06.440
Yeah, and you always have to click advanced to get the things you really want anyways

25:06.720 --> 25:11.200
So the the that stuff they've managed to simplify that those experiences in Chrome

25:11.200 --> 25:17.260
It appears to use less resources while giving me more information and automatically including some of the extensions

25:17.260 --> 25:21.960
I want and now also I can play Netflix and it's in for me because Firefox just hasn't worked in the past

25:21.960 --> 25:25.320
I'm thinking this could be a good potential. It is nice to it

25:25.320 --> 25:30.280
I mean, even if it's not crazy different, you know a broader markets. Here's the other thing. I like Wes

25:30.640 --> 25:33.760
You're right. It cuz and you know, did you hear the offer just go?

25:34.840 --> 25:38.720
Here's the other thing I like West though is they have done a good job of outreach to the Linux community

25:39.000 --> 25:41.900
You know, they've they've they've exchanged emails with this show

25:42.160 --> 25:48.220
They have gone out of their way to like notify Linux news publications of things that are applicable to Linux users

25:48.220 --> 25:52.000
So they seem to want the Linux user base too, which is I think a good sign

25:52.000 --> 25:54.360
Yeah, we don't get that from a lot of people

25:54.360 --> 26:01.080
Oh and a go-go also points out something that's kind of neat is it can interpret theme color the meta tag

26:01.080 --> 26:04.360
And so depending on the page you're on the window

26:04.900 --> 26:07.760
Chrome can change to match sort of like Chrome does on the Android

26:07.760 --> 26:11.280
Yeah, right on the Android the Android version of Chrome does when you're on a web page

26:11.280 --> 26:14.560
Like if you're on a green page the title bar turns green it all kind of matches or whatever

26:14.560 --> 26:18.680
The volley does that as well the volley also has a dark theme right out of the box

26:18.680 --> 26:21.040
Which I like a lot it starts with a light theme, but as a dark theme

26:21.160 --> 26:22.280
so

26:22.280 --> 26:25.080
My quick take on it is impressed from like the two hours

26:25.080 --> 26:28.640
I played with it again this morning after it's been you know months and I

26:29.240 --> 26:31.040
Think I'm gonna put it on all my machines for a while

26:31.040 --> 26:34.120
I just don't I don't know what the sync situation is all that but I'll figure it out

26:34.120 --> 26:38.440
I'll play with it and let you know so I want to shift gears for a moment

26:38.440 --> 26:43.300
You guys know I got a I got to soapbox on the show and I almost have to avoid the show

26:43.300 --> 26:49.400
I literally I swear guys. I promise you I try not to make this a topic every single week

26:49.400 --> 26:53.360
but it is such an epidemic in the Linux ecosystem that I

26:54.280 --> 26:56.280
Sometimes I just can't help myself

26:59.040 --> 27:02.320
This Sunday I kind of got on or no it was last unplugged

27:02.320 --> 27:08.280
I kind of caught I kind of got on SJV ends case for saying that Linux mint was the best desktop ever

27:08.440 --> 27:11.760
You remember me I got into the best desktop ever I said it come on. Is that true?

27:11.760 --> 27:15.440
Is that really the whole thing about what is best even yeah? Yeah, yeah

27:15.440 --> 27:20.200
Is that a phrase that you can stand behind right and it and you know he said in 25 years the best Linux

27:20.200 --> 27:21.840
I have reason that I took a look at it, and I said well

27:21.840 --> 27:26.300
What about these issues and I laid them out on Sunday show and I would argue those don't those those issues

27:26.300 --> 27:28.400
I raised do not make it the best Linux ever

27:28.520 --> 27:34.520
It may be the best for certain work cases or certain scenarios or a very good option would be a reasonable way to put that

27:34.520 --> 27:39.100
Totally so this next one really got my attention. It was published today

27:39.100 --> 27:40.900
by

27:40.900 --> 27:44.460
SJVN it's the best Linux laptop ever a buddy

27:44.460 --> 27:51.380
Oh, yeah, that's right the XPS 13 is the best Linux laptop about ever make no mistake about it the

27:51.660 --> 27:58.500
2016 Dell XPS 13 developer edition laptop is wonderful. It's fast the display is gorgeous, and it's less than three pounds

27:59.020 --> 28:04.820
But oh that price tag. It's the best laptop ever Wes and then you know as somebody what do I got hey Wes?

28:05.380 --> 28:07.460
Hey, Wes. What is this right here? What is this?

28:07.460 --> 28:12.260
What what is this right why that looks like an XPS 13? Yeah this right here in my hands is the Dell XPS

28:12.260 --> 28:15.860
That's the best lab Linux laptop. Let me tell you Wes. Let me tell you so wow

28:15.860 --> 28:18.500
I don't I don't even need to be the one to tell you about it down

28:18.500 --> 28:22.340
I think it's a fine laptop, and I don't I don't discourage anyone from picking one up

28:22.860 --> 28:25.620
But I think about it all the time. I'll admit that right now

28:25.620 --> 28:28.300
Here's the things that Stephen Jay himself says are an issue

28:28.900 --> 28:33.040
But then still says it's the best Linux laptop ever so the display is great

28:33.040 --> 28:35.040
I love it, but it's only 13 inches and

28:35.040 --> 28:38.960
It is legitimately kind of small and cramped when you get a 4k version

28:38.960 --> 28:42.480
It's almost unreadable, and there's an oddity that really makes it stand out

28:42.920 --> 28:46.600
They stick the webcam down in the bottom left corner of the display

28:46.600 --> 28:52.160
And he goes on to say it doesn't really matter that much it is all I've seen a lot of other people complain

28:52.160 --> 28:57.360
I don't ever use it. I never use it. It looks so bad also like he admits here

28:57.360 --> 29:01.920
it's limited to only 16 gigs of RAM now that might be fine absolutely for like a

29:01.920 --> 29:09.520
A VI workflow or an aura or a max workflow if you're a job a dev or virtualization

29:09.520 --> 29:11.920
You know you need to run different instances to test stuff

29:11.920 --> 29:16.720
You need more than 16 gigs of RAM especially if you're getting that from work or something who will who's willing to pay for it

29:16.720 --> 29:19.360
And you're just like well right that's the max doesn't disqualify it

29:19.600 --> 29:22.000
But I think it raises the question does it make it the best

29:22.560 --> 29:27.000
I think like you see those think pads that Noah's pine or other things where it might not be as pretty but

29:27.000 --> 29:31.800
Here's the other thing does the absolute best Linux laptop for 2016

29:32.820 --> 29:35.820
Ship with an OS that launched in 2014

29:36.600 --> 29:41.040
Because it ships with Ubuntu 1404 now later on Dell plans to update it

29:41.040 --> 29:46.040
But does 2016's best Linux laptop ship with a for 2014 OS

29:46.040 --> 29:48.040
I don't think it does nope

29:48.040 --> 29:53.720
I don't I don't think so if you went and got an intro where or you went and got a system 76 it would ship

29:53.720 --> 30:00.840
With the absolute latest version also he mentioned that it ships with Thunderbolt 3 and DisplayPort and no HDMI or Ethernet

30:01.240 --> 30:07.600
But he fails to mention the fact that the DisplayPort basically doesn't work and the Thunderbolt basically doesn't work either. Yeah, it's horrible

30:07.600 --> 30:13.520
I in all of my time with it the DisplayPort's never worked correctly with maybe the here's the other problem

30:13.520 --> 30:17.040
Here's the true problem to is the main display is 4k

30:17.200 --> 30:22.640
But but when you hook it up to an external display X X does not handle that well

30:22.640 --> 30:25.360
You can't have you can't have one screen be high DPI

30:25.920 --> 30:33.080
4k and one screen being 19 by 1080 1080 and unless you've got the nice 4k monitors at home and in 1404

30:33.560 --> 30:37.960
Specifically in Ubuntu 1404 specifically in some cases the DisplayPort doesn't work at all

30:38.040 --> 30:38.960
It doesn't work out

30:38.960 --> 30:43.280
So the version that ships with you have to be running a newer you have to be running the absolute latest

30:43.360 --> 30:47.840
Hardware enabled entitlement kernel of Ubuntu 1404 to make this work, which Dell does ship

30:47.840 --> 30:53.200
But it it literally then you're in another situation where it's like you want to build that. Yeah, right exactly

30:53.200 --> 30:56.280
That's the problem and and then he goes on to say the touchpad sucks

30:56.720 --> 30:58.720
Then he says the touchpad sucks

30:59.320 --> 31:05.920
And then he added then to top it all off to top it all off. He mentions that the Windows 10 home version

31:06.600 --> 31:11.220
Starts at seven hundred ninety nine dollars and this version starts at one thousand ninety nine dollars

31:11.220 --> 31:18.220
So it's even more expensive for the similarly equipped Windows version, but yet, this is the best Linux laptop of 2016

31:19.220 --> 31:20.220
and

31:20.220 --> 31:24.420
And last week he declared that Linux Mint was the best Linux desktop of 2016

31:24.420 --> 31:27.220
How can the best laptop not run the best OS?

31:27.220 --> 31:29.220
That doesn't make sense

31:29.220 --> 31:33.220
And like it's got security issues like this is a this is a legitimate problem

31:33.220 --> 31:39.220
And here's here's what I'm talking about because here's a better example of a headline that was also published today

31:39.220 --> 31:45.220
At opensource.com who I've given a hard time in the past a Red Hat employee Anderson over there did his review

31:46.220 --> 31:51.220
Surprisingly just posted it today. I'm sure a total coincidence of his Dell XPS 13

31:51.220 --> 31:54.220
And here's the title he went with get ready for this one

31:55.220 --> 31:58.220
Hands-on with the Linux ready Dell XPS 13 developer edition

32:00.220 --> 32:02.220
How about that that's way more

32:02.220 --> 32:09.220
Like there's no like there's there's just there's nine-day difference between and he goes through and he does such a better review

32:09.220 --> 32:14.220
He talks about he compares it to the ThinkPads. He compares it. Yeah, he seems like a must-read

32:14.220 --> 32:18.220
He talks about trying to install Fedora 24 on there. I mean way better

32:19.220 --> 32:22.220
And he does talk he does say it's a good well-built machine

32:23.220 --> 32:28.220
And that it runs Fedora and Ubuntu virtually perfectly, which is you know, it's a good he says if you're a system administrator

32:28.220 --> 32:33.220
Something like this is a great machine for you and I echo that if you you know, and I put mint 18 with cinnamon

32:33.220 --> 32:37.220
And I turned on high DPI mode. I'm leaving it on there. It's so nice. Wow. I'm

32:39.220 --> 32:46.220
I really liked it. So anyways, I really am getting sick of this. I'm right. I don't I don't have a particular point

32:46.220 --> 32:50.220
I don't want to make a whole thing out of this. It's just this is an ongoing problem

32:50.220 --> 32:56.220
That I feel like Linux journalism suffers from yes, and it's it's just it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's just

32:56.220 --> 33:00.220
Suffers from yes, and it's just it feels makes it feel very bottom of the barrel

33:00.220 --> 33:06.160
And I know we don't have like the biggest journalism community out there, but it makes it also very hard to find reasonable things

33:06.160 --> 33:10.860
So it's like that second article. That's a great deep dive a real analysis from the headline

33:10.860 --> 33:13.380
You can't just walk away with a TLDR point

33:13.380 --> 33:13.740
You know what?

33:13.740 --> 33:16.500
I mean like you have to you have to read it to understand it and two years from now

33:16.500 --> 33:22.340
It would still be worthwhile. Whereas the first article it's kind of nothing and there's just so many like oh

33:22.340 --> 33:27.220
It's the best of this year. Maybe kind of except for this but I'm still gonna call the best for your clicks

33:27.580 --> 33:31.740
Yeah, and of course what they're really aiming for is those is those Google juice search. Oh, this is beautiful

33:32.580 --> 33:35.820
Doesn't cinnamon look really good on the XPS there. Yes. I know

33:35.820 --> 33:41.540
I mean, I would think this was 1080p except on a super super high-res screen, right?

33:41.540 --> 33:44.660
Yeah, everything fits the fonts and text looks super great

33:45.620 --> 33:47.120
You see you got to give a Clem credit

33:47.120 --> 33:51.580
I mean that really is the one of the best out of the box high DPI once I check a box

33:51.580 --> 33:55.980
It's when someone gonna make a linux mint spin that just enables the kernel updates and that's the only change

33:55.980 --> 33:57.980
Well, you can still do it. Oh, yeah

33:58.300 --> 33:59.340
But yeah

33:59.340 --> 34:03.720
So anyways, I'm gonna keep that on there for a while because I think it really works well on the I'm excited to see what you

34:03.720 --> 34:10.360
Think all right moving on you may have noticed a certain lack of poppy or wimpy this week

34:10.360 --> 34:12.360
I secretly use oh, there he is

34:13.660 --> 34:16.020
actually, I happen to know where they both are right now and

34:16.020 --> 34:22.200
This is the reason why I think snap packages are going to be the dominant Universal installer this

34:22.840 --> 34:26.960
You don't even know it. But this week is the week that snap packages one and

34:27.720 --> 34:31.960
I know that PDV just just shipped in a flat pack. I know that just happened

34:32.960 --> 34:34.400
but

34:34.400 --> 34:39.440
What canonical is doing right now is going to push it over the edge. So let's break this down

34:39.440 --> 34:47.480
Let's get into what's happening as we record this very show canonical is holding a snappy sprint event in Germany to ship up Universal snaps

34:47.840 --> 34:55.680
Canonical announced soft PD and others about an upcoming event that aims to bring different developers together and contributors from various well-known projects to work together

34:55.680 --> 34:59.800
On shaping up Universal snaps. Okay, interesting. But what does that mean?

35:00.160 --> 35:02.760
Well, I happen to know what it means in practical sense

35:02.760 --> 35:08.800
Is that mark shuttleworth and others made direct invites to members of the community from all over to bring them out?

35:08.800 --> 35:13.640
and here's poppy on G plus talking about hitting the hitting out hitting the

35:14.040 --> 35:20.660
The air and going out to the big event, but what's really been interesting is following wimpy's posts on Google Plus

35:21.560 --> 35:22.820
so

35:22.820 --> 35:24.540
wimpy posted at 1 a.m

35:24.540 --> 35:31.200
Just finished the first cross distro session on day two of the snappy sprint sitting in the room our representatives from Debian

35:31.600 --> 35:34.680
fedora arch Linux open Sousa

35:34.680 --> 35:41.320
elementary and Ubuntu all working together to make sure snappy is well integrated into various distro CI systems and

35:41.560 --> 35:43.560
Provides consistent experience everywhere

35:44.400 --> 35:46.400
Which look at that fruit plate right?

35:46.920 --> 35:48.920
Then another post from wimpy

35:49.580 --> 35:52.240
Now this is the snappy sprint community team dinner

35:52.480 --> 35:58.240
These are the people in the room that are not from Ubuntu have been invited to represent their distro or project around this table is

35:58.240 --> 36:05.120
App stream folks arch Linux Debian elementary fedora open wrt open Sousa kde and of course him from mate

36:05.600 --> 36:06.800
Behind the camera he got it

36:06.800 --> 36:09.720
he got an invite from mark to come to make sure wow and then and the

36:10.200 --> 36:14.520
The reason everybody's there is what they really want is they want a consistent experience

36:14.520 --> 36:16.160
So they want just everybody kind of on the same page

36:16.160 --> 36:19.080
So they brought people out to this to meet in person

36:19.300 --> 36:24.040
Which is exactly when when the when this happened the flat pack folks like this isn't how you do it

36:24.040 --> 36:26.360
You have to meet in person and talk right well look at this

36:26.360 --> 36:32.120
And this is why I think this isn't this is how this is this is a way in which app images

36:32.200 --> 36:35.440
Don't have the means or resources to compete flat packs

36:35.440 --> 36:40.640
don't have the organization or corporate backing to compete like this and canonical does and

36:41.240 --> 36:43.240
Look how fast they've moved on this

36:43.280 --> 36:49.720
They've moved from announcing it to then making it all distro agnostic to now flying out key

36:49.880 --> 36:55.280
Contributors and stakeholders to this event and wimpy was talking about another post how he's sitting next to Daniel from elementary OS

36:55.280 --> 36:59.320
And they're checking out each other's betas of the latest OS sharing. You know stories and whatnot

36:59.320 --> 37:03.240
It's pretty cool to have a forum like this where people can this is gonna push it over the edge

37:03.240 --> 37:05.880
Yeah, I mean, I really think because you have

37:06.360 --> 37:13.960
These these gatekeepers of their particular communities or software at this event all collaborating together and talking about how to deliver software

37:14.920 --> 37:19.020
How could flat packs compete with this well, and I think it also kind of highlights

37:19.020 --> 37:19.880
What?

37:19.880 --> 37:25.920
Where where snaps really seem like they're gonna be playing like flat pack seems like they've spent a lot of time thinking about a lot

37:25.920 --> 37:29.640
Of the underlying issues more related to the how package management works today

37:29.640 --> 37:33.600
There's a lot of thought about like when you're building up a distro and you want to use this where snaps

37:33.600 --> 37:37.480
It really seems like they're focused on like whatever you're running you're running Linux and you want this application

37:37.560 --> 37:43.520
We are the thing to go for and if they bring in all this not all but they're bringing a fair number of stakeholders

37:43.520 --> 37:46.520
I think there are still some issues like the CLA that kind of stuff, right?

37:46.520 --> 37:51.120
But if they're at least you know, if it's good terms people are invited and it's like you don't have to support this

37:51.120 --> 37:53.720
But let's all make it so that everyone wants to use it

37:53.720 --> 37:57.080
Well, and if there ends up being free implementations of the backend

37:57.080 --> 38:00.640
Which it has to be super straightforward the CLA may be less of an issue there too. Yeah

38:00.880 --> 38:04.240
I I guess so it's the same reason why I think

38:04.960 --> 38:06.960
steam and valve

38:07.280 --> 38:09.280
Could have only have worked with Ubuntu

38:09.880 --> 38:15.520
they're in a they're in a unique position where they're flexible and nimble enough to act extremely fast and

38:15.520 --> 38:17.280
they

38:17.280 --> 38:23.000
You know apparently, you know mark says let's do this and then they just do it this this came together very quickly

38:23.000 --> 38:26.240
They announced it on July 5th. And now here we are on

38:26.720 --> 38:32.320
It's been going for two or three days. But as we record this that is a quick turnaround. Yeah, so they're really they're moving fast

38:32.320 --> 38:35.880
And I just meanwhile the flat pack folks just got a name

38:35.880 --> 38:40.480
yep, and it is interesting too because I mean as we've seen for the past few years a bunch of have been kind of the

38:40.480 --> 38:43.600
People where it's like as much as we have a Linux platform

38:43.600 --> 38:49.920
They're it right. So it's a nice to at least to see them kind of fulfilling that role or trying to even if not

38:49.920 --> 38:51.880
Everyone wants them to be that role not everyone wants them to be what it is

38:51.880 --> 38:55.480
Right, but when people when you have an app that's package for Linux eight out of ten times

38:55.480 --> 39:02.460
It's it's packaged for a bunch you so if that becomes for snaps and it runs everywhere just already when you said that

39:02.460 --> 39:04.980
You know what else it made me think of is thank God. They're actually

39:05.760 --> 39:13.360
Doing something like they announced Ubuntu for Android and Ubuntu TV and nothing happened and they didn't do anything with it

39:13.360 --> 39:16.160
And you know, it wasn't a position where they had a lot of leverage

39:16.480 --> 39:21.440
now when you see them in a position where they have some leverage they really do act and they're acting quickly and

39:22.040 --> 39:25.000
You know who cares if it does if it does if you don't want to use it

39:25.000 --> 39:28.600
You don't have to but it's super nice that they're they're actually working with their outreaching

39:28.600 --> 39:32.640
They're working with open Sousa and arch and others. They're trying to do the right thing

39:32.640 --> 39:37.900
Yeah, they also just recently announced snappy playpen a place to test learn and create snaps and share best practices

39:37.900 --> 39:44.420
And it with a big focus on desktop applications including in here is MPV shot

39:44.420 --> 39:47.180
Well, SMP player a buntu clock app

39:47.680 --> 39:53.020
YouTube DL VLC a VLC VLC developers are also at the years. There's if there's several other ones

39:53.020 --> 39:55.200
Hopefully when the guys get back those the next week

39:55.700 --> 40:02.040
Yeah, I don't really like to know how it went who they got to talk to and if they have a sense of where adoption

40:02.040 --> 40:06.260
Is that I know I'm really curious to see how the representatives from the other distributions what they're feeling what?

40:06.260 --> 40:10.540
Yeah, yeah, and also are to the people who go say from Sousa

40:11.820 --> 40:13.820
Did they become?

40:13.860 --> 40:17.900
Sort of outliers in their local community when I come back. Are they traitors?

40:17.900 --> 40:23.100
Are they different do they have to come back and become an advocate and advocate to the other Sousa people?

40:23.100 --> 40:27.460
This is a technology that's worth adopting even though it's from the evil evil horrible canonical boy

40:27.460 --> 40:30.100
that seems like an interesting position to be in and

40:31.180 --> 40:35.020
Well, and I don't really see anybody here. Okay, one last thing. We'll move off of this

40:35.020 --> 40:39.660
Nice run the other thing we'll move right off. This is

40:40.580 --> 40:45.140
Nobody's reporting on this soft PD had the announcement about the event taking place

40:45.420 --> 40:49.140
But the here is an example of canonical in my estimation

40:49.700 --> 40:52.840
Coming up with an idea outreaching directly to community members

40:53.540 --> 40:57.300
Flipping the bill to to fly them out have a venue

40:58.060 --> 41:03.780
Organize all of this mark shallow worth himself is at least in the case of one of these that I know of calling them up

41:03.780 --> 41:05.780
Directly and saying hey, I would like you to be there

41:06.660 --> 41:13.020
This to me feels very much like a company that works with the community and yet it in this kind of stuff

41:13.460 --> 41:16.900
We are literally the only outlet reporting on it. I will say

41:17.380 --> 41:21.020
Might have people might have been happier if they had done this before they had that announcement

41:21.540 --> 41:26.820
Right, right. Yeah, maybe this is a maybe this is kind of what would the interest be there if they had done it like this?

41:26.820 --> 41:30.420
That's a very good point. Yeah, I mean, you know as they say no press is bad press. Well in

41:31.020 --> 41:33.020
people you once now that

41:33.020 --> 41:35.500
This conference when you get there

41:36.020 --> 41:40.940
There's a huge there the call a huge part of the conversation has already had been happened and you already run packages

41:41.020 --> 41:42.260
How can they be used?

41:42.260 --> 41:47.180
What are examples of software that could be packaged up the snaps all of that's already been answered by the time they all get to?

41:47.180 --> 41:50.600
The Sprint so you could argue the execution you might be right though

41:50.600 --> 41:54.860
I think the fedora folks would say so right sure because now you could have that press release gonna be like, yeah

41:54.860 --> 41:59.580
Look, they did it. It's on the up-and-up. Yeah, I wonder and I wonder possibly

41:59.580 --> 42:03.700
I think land rash also agrees with you. It looks like so

42:04.420 --> 42:06.780
Yeah, I either way I think it's really great

42:06.780 --> 42:10.980
They're doing it and I think it's also interesting that it's the kind of things that does there's the kind of thing that doesn't

42:10.980 --> 42:16.140
Get reporting and I think in part that might have been because canonical didn't really outreach too much press

42:16.140 --> 42:16.900
Yeah, right

42:16.900 --> 42:20.540
They didn't they didn't tell us and they they told soft PD that it was happening

42:20.540 --> 42:24.860
But there's like they didn't invite any press to be there at the event to cover it to relay what happened

42:24.860 --> 42:27.780
And I think that's maybe a shame because one of the things maybe it's

42:27.780 --> 42:32.300
You know, maybe it's just like one of those, you know work sprints where they're trying to write is done

42:32.300 --> 42:35.340
Yeah, I want to do the press yet. I know I think that's exactly what it is

42:36.180 --> 42:40.800
Yeah, I know I know but see what the problem is is then that's a we just threw it over the wall now here it

42:40.800 --> 42:45.740
Is instead of covering it in the when they're actually doing the nitty-gritty community aspect of it

42:45.860 --> 42:50.780
Especially that like you might not even have to focus on the like the outcomes just kind of focusing on the like cross

42:50.980 --> 42:56.940
Distribution hand-reaching that kind of stuff would be really interesting. That's the story. Yeah, exactly. That's the story what happens

42:56.940 --> 42:58.940
I mean, you can already run it on a lot of these anyway

43:00.180 --> 43:07.220
You know the flat packs or app images may win out in the end or nor nor nothing or just tar files with hardlink libraries

43:07.220 --> 43:09.220
That'd be but it's the future

43:09.660 --> 43:16.500
But the real story is is that this company is calling up these stakeholders of these different distributions and bringing them out

43:16.500 --> 43:20.940
That's the story that's not getting reported on I think and it's it goes it

43:21.020 --> 43:26.580
Would play directly against the narrative that not the not invented here narrative that's constantly thrown in canonical space

43:26.580 --> 43:30.740
I just I just don't think they're quite savvy enough because they're so busy actually trying to do it

43:30.740 --> 43:33.500
yeah, they're not thinking about the the the PR spinner as

43:34.580 --> 43:41.120
Politics would say the optics of how it all goes down, but good for them for doing it either way. Absolutely good for them

43:41.180 --> 43:44.580
All right. I want to mention ting real quick before we go much further into the show

43:44.580 --> 43:48.020
That's my mobile service provider and it's mobile that makes sense because you only pay for what you're using

43:48.020 --> 43:53.660
There's no contract or no early termination fee go to linux.com to get our special promo

43:53.660 --> 43:58.060
You get $25 off a device Heyo or $25 in credit if you bring a ting device

43:58.140 --> 44:00.920
Which you might because they've got two networks GSM and CDMA

44:00.920 --> 44:06.420
Which means there's a lot to choose from huge number of devices and really who doesn't have a device now that you can pop a?

44:06.420 --> 44:09.340
Sim card into they just had a great sale on those SIM cards, too

44:09.340 --> 44:13.540
But now you can pick them up for nine bucks. And again, there's no contract you activated and you just use what you need

44:13.540 --> 44:18.160
They have a really good dashboard to manage all of this and you get to talk to a real human being

44:18.700 --> 44:20.700
Whenever you need to they also

44:20.700 --> 44:23.660
Have one of the best deals on

44:24.420 --> 44:28.380
like just straight like if you need something for like notifications and messaging like a

44:28.740 --> 44:31.240
if you want like a like an alarm system or

44:31.860 --> 44:36.900
Like a I was actually thinking before I mentioned this like a hardware temperature monitoring device and like your data center

44:36.900 --> 44:40.060
You want to we have we have one we're thinking about building out for the garage here at the studio

44:40.060 --> 44:41.460
This is one of the best deals

44:41.460 --> 44:41.660
Yep

44:41.660 --> 44:47.700
Because it's only six dollars for the line and they just you can't they you cannot beat this because it's so it's only six dollars

44:47.700 --> 44:52.900
The line and then you just pay for the text messages that you use and it's really easy to manage all of it

44:52.900 --> 44:54.100
You could even put caps and say all right

44:54.100 --> 44:57.980
Well, if it goes above a thousand text messages cut it off and you can use it

44:57.980 --> 45:03.380
You can do that in their web or their apps. They just I also just really consider that too for automated systems

45:03.380 --> 45:05.340
They just really have one of the best deals out there for that

45:05.340 --> 45:10.700
They have a savings calculator where you can plug all of that in there. Check out their devices page for some of their great devices

45:10.700 --> 45:14.980
I love the Nexus devices on there and they're also constantly posting tips up on their site

45:14.980 --> 45:21.640
Check them out go to linux.ting.com a series that I've been kind of following too is the different cable cutting

45:21.900 --> 45:26.180
It's so cool. How interested they are. You can tell that a lot of people are

45:26.700 --> 45:27.540
cord cutters

45:27.540 --> 45:34.600
they're they're living the the online life and they also have a post on here about learning what they what like what

45:35.100 --> 45:41.380
Customer service lessons they've learned since they launched fiber internet, which is kind of interesting. That is very interesting fiber internet, man

45:41.380 --> 45:44.940
Whoo ting ting. I need you to bring it here. Here's what you got to do

45:44.940 --> 45:49.420
Go to linux.ting.com try out that savings calculator. It's how how would what would you save?

45:49.420 --> 45:52.020
That's what it says right you click that click that put your deets in there

45:52.020 --> 45:56.880
Who put up a dupes see what you would save. That's your litmus test if you pass like me

45:56.880 --> 46:02.180
I save like two thousand dollars a year. I mean every two years. I said about a thousand dollars a year. That's nice

46:02.180 --> 46:04.180
Hey, that's a brand new best Linux laptop

46:04.180 --> 46:10.540
Ha ha ha ha yeah sure is ha ha ha ha also businesses like if you got 10

46:11.100 --> 46:15.820
To like 20 employees something like that. Yeah, there's actually for those like you want someone to have a phone

46:15.820 --> 46:20.420
They don't really need it, but you want them great for some family members, too. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I really like it

46:20.420 --> 46:26.740
Also another reason I love ting is I have a I have an old old LG tablet that has a SIM slot in it

46:26.740 --> 46:27.980
Oh nice and

46:27.980 --> 46:31.620
Every now and then it's nice just to have another machine with a data connection

46:31.620 --> 46:36.540
And so I have a ting sim in there and I can turn it on and off right there in the drop-down menu from my notifications

46:36.540 --> 46:41.180
And I activate it and I get a different data connection and six dollars. You just don't feel bad about six dollars

46:41.180 --> 46:42.940
It's a sandwich, you know, it's great

46:42.940 --> 46:48.240
It was really great ting's a great service a great company backed by two cows as well check them out Linux that ting calm

46:48.240 --> 46:52.900
That's where you got to go to support this show and get the discount a big thanks to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program

46:52.900 --> 47:01.300
um Linux dot ting comm so last week I talked about my desperate need for a VPN to avoid an upstream proxy that

47:01.420 --> 47:04.740
Not only was spying all of my HTTP and HTTPS traffic

47:04.740 --> 47:09.580
But also just adding unacceptable amounts of latency to my web browsing session

47:09.580 --> 47:13.380
You're an impatient man. You need that you need those, you know sure and you know my DNS now

47:13.980 --> 47:15.340
Nothing is more frustrating

47:15.340 --> 47:20.660
honestly where it hits me the worst is when I'm in Google Maps and I'm in satellite mode and I'm like moving around in the

47:20.660 --> 47:21.900
tiles and

47:21.900 --> 47:24.020
It's so slow to load each

47:24.060 --> 47:29.020
Title and they load in like an old like when you used to look at porn back in the 90s on the internet and you

47:29.020 --> 47:31.460
Had to wait for the JPEGs to download, right?

47:32.220 --> 47:34.220
Just like that

47:34.500 --> 47:39.860
So I had to find a VPN to just essentially route around this not even just for the privacy

47:39.860 --> 47:41.140
Although that was an element of it

47:41.140 --> 47:45.660
But to basically get around this proxy server and see if it actually made a difference in my web speed

47:45.660 --> 47:48.620
So we talked about this last week and if you guys want to know more about it

47:48.620 --> 47:54.500
Check it out by listening to episode 153 of the unplugged program. So I I think I'm not

47:55.460 --> 47:59.220
Gonna make I'm not gonna claim. This is my final solution, but this

47:59.900 --> 48:06.540
Damn, this is working. Well for me. This is working. So damn. Well the performance way better the ease of setup

48:07.500 --> 48:13.280
Mind-blowingly simple and I got a couple of recommendations. So I'm gonna talk about air VPN today. I

48:13.280 --> 48:20.200
I I may end up and we'll talk more about this in a moment doing a open VPN solution on my own server

48:20.640 --> 48:23.560
but I'll talk about that in a moment first, I want to talk about air VPN and

48:24.160 --> 48:30.320
It's a VPN based on open VPN and it's operated by activists and hacktivists in defense of net neutrality

48:30.720 --> 48:32.720
privacy and against censorship

48:33.640 --> 48:37.780
Okay, that kind of gets my that sort of piques my interest a couple of other things. I like about it

48:37.780 --> 48:39.780
not only not only did I

48:39.780 --> 48:43.900
Not only they get a lot of good recommendations from the audience

48:43.900 --> 48:47.220
I got people who emailed in said I've been using air VPN for a while

48:47.220 --> 48:51.380
I really think you should check them out. I got people who tweeted me said a air VPN is great

48:52.200 --> 48:57.680
They seem to really support Linux the they also apparently accept Bitcoin for payment

48:57.680 --> 49:01.500
Which is kind of neat when you're setting up for a VPN provider and you want to really stay more anonymous

49:02.060 --> 49:04.860
They also allow you to log into their service anonymously

49:04.860 --> 49:11.420
Which is which is really nice and they support just every damn near device out there. And of course, like I said open VPN

49:11.420 --> 49:13.420
They have unlimited and free

49:14.780 --> 49:17.820
Transfer from work for what I have. I have no maximum speed limit and

49:19.380 --> 49:24.220
Really, I really like it. So here's one of the other things that really thought I thought was super slick

49:24.220 --> 49:29.900
And again, I haven't shopped a lot for VPN services. So maybe this is kind of common, but I thought this was pretty neat here

49:29.900 --> 49:35.860
You they have an open VPN configuration generator. So you tell them what OS you want?

49:35.860 --> 49:38.700
So you choose your operating system and I'm so I choose Linux here

49:38.700 --> 49:43.060
And then they tell you to pick your server and they break it down at first by region

49:43.060 --> 49:48.980
Which includes a lot of the servers in that region and you can they give you the capacity of the regions right here?

49:48.980 --> 49:55.740
But what what's even nicer for me is because I'm specifically trying to find the fastest route around my proxy

49:55.740 --> 49:57.740
I'm not really trying to

49:57.820 --> 49:59.140
Hide my traffic

49:59.140 --> 50:02.500
I'm not trying to you just pretend like I'm in Europe to upstream. Mm-hmm

50:02.980 --> 50:07.660
You can actually break it down by individual servers individual countries

50:07.660 --> 50:11.420
So here's Canada, of course, Switzerland France United Kingdom right here

50:11.420 --> 50:17.420
and then as I scroll down the list you find the United States and all the different servers in the United States and of course

50:17.700 --> 50:22.920
For me, it was just a matter of now either picking a couple of these which I could so I could pick this one in

50:22.920 --> 50:29.780
Miami this one in Georgia if I wanted to and this one in Los Angeles and it will include all of those in my open

50:29.780 --> 50:36.900
VPN script it's about to generate for me. I have a couple other options. I accept the terms of service and then I simply generate it

50:37.460 --> 50:41.420
It downloads the script for me and then you just go into gnome

50:41.980 --> 50:48.840
You have to have open VPN gnome network manager installed, but you just go in there and import the script say, okay

50:48.840 --> 50:55.640
You connect using network manager and your VPN and it's great. I was connected within 10 seconds. Wow

50:55.640 --> 51:00.160
And there's other sites that out there that help generate open VPN configs for you

51:00.160 --> 51:03.760
But the way they bundled this in there was really nice the way they tie in the server status

51:03.760 --> 51:09.080
You can pick and choose and see what the current transfer rate is for the whole server. How many users are connected?

51:09.080 --> 51:14.600
I think all of that stuff is really nice geeky stuff. Then they also give you ways to do speed testing on those

51:14.600 --> 51:19.600
So yeah, I was about to ask about that. Yeah speed testings nights, especially if you can yes rake up something

51:19.600 --> 51:22.240
We're like, well, especially you know, you've got you've got those

51:22.240 --> 51:24.080
Yeah, you're roving around all over the place

51:24.080 --> 51:30.320
You once you get connected you come back to the air VPN sites air VPN org speed test and then you can you can speed

51:30.320 --> 51:32.640
Test your connect which is just great did

51:32.760 --> 51:36.800
So not only am I able to try out a whole bunch of different servers to figure out what region is best for me

51:36.800 --> 51:39.400
But I actually be able to test them and the air VPN guys

51:39.400 --> 51:45.480
they are and gals seem like they're really straightforward folks that make it easy to be anonymous if you want to and

51:45.960 --> 51:50.440
Have full-fledged Linux support and I like that they promote the fact that it's open VPN, too

51:50.440 --> 51:52.240
They don't try to hide it as some sort of black magic

51:52.240 --> 51:56.620
They're proud that they're using open VPN and that appealed to me as well as they're transparent with that

51:56.620 --> 51:59.460
So that was sort of my temporary solution

52:00.340 --> 52:02.860
To see if this actually solved my problem

52:03.200 --> 52:09.040
Before I went in and built a server that I was gonna manage and be responsible for and read a tutorial and all that stuff

52:09.040 --> 52:11.920
I wanted to see if this actually would solve my problem

52:11.920 --> 52:18.760
It absolutely did and if the performance is better than that the net Eliza results come back and no longer complain about proxy issues

52:18.840 --> 52:25.080
Yeah, so now the next question is is am I gonna implement this at a network level and am I gonna host my own?

52:25.400 --> 52:27.600
So the first question the network level one

52:27.600 --> 52:32.720
I'm not so sure about the cradle point that I have and I got tweeted saying hey which model cradle point you have I can't

52:32.720 --> 52:34.120
Remember at the moment

52:34.120 --> 52:38.040
But if I dug through the settings, I don't see built-in VPN support

52:38.040 --> 52:40.040
So I would probably have to set up a Linux box

52:40.800 --> 52:46.480
Somewhere on this somewhere on the edge or just which is it was in the RV is not a super great option right now

52:46.480 --> 52:48.640
But I might eventually go there anyway, so it's a possibility

52:49.400 --> 52:51.880
but what I'm really struggling with is is

52:52.560 --> 52:58.520
Is this the type of thing that is that is valuable enough and fragile enough that I should probably be hosting it myself

52:58.520 --> 53:05.400
And this is the this is the age-old problem that I constantly can't keep running into is do I take advantage of an easy?

53:05.400 --> 53:11.360
Solution that allows me a lot of flexibility. I can try testing all different locations. It gives me tools. They give me scripts

53:11.800 --> 53:15.480
Do I go they have their own staff right and they have support if you need it?

53:15.480 --> 53:20.160
Or is it time to go spin up a droplet install Ubuntu or or something like that sent to us?

53:20.160 --> 53:24.640
Whatever free BSD, of course, and then probably even a one-click open VPN thing

53:24.640 --> 53:30.080
Maybe so maybe so and I know this is not a new new question, but it's one that I'm now once again

53:30.840 --> 53:34.240
Facing I'm just sitting here. Oh crap now now that I know this does fix it

53:34.240 --> 53:37.440
What do I do next and I know you kind of had a same similar thing this week

53:38.040 --> 53:41.960
You've been messing around with command-line accounting software for a while. Yes

53:41.960 --> 53:46.120
I have and that's sort of progressing into well now what do I do? Do I self host this? Where you at with that?

53:46.460 --> 53:49.400
Yeah, I mean, it's the same thing, you know, it's like I have I have less time

53:49.760 --> 53:52.720
But at the same time I do have the ability right like I know how to run a server

53:52.720 --> 53:56.360
I know how to set up a Linux machine. So I do have the ability and it's it's one of those

53:57.220 --> 54:03.120
You know, where where do the trade-off why why and and so like a lot of people have used mint or other things?

54:03.120 --> 54:08.200
You need a budget as a popular one, right? And you know, you want to understand your money little cash

54:08.200 --> 54:10.200
yeah, but there's a lot of tools out there where it's like

54:10.720 --> 54:15.160
It really depends on seems like it depends on how much flexibility you need and how much you trust cuz like I've enjoyed mint

54:15.160 --> 54:19.340
But now I'm in a little more of a complicated situation where you know, I've got some business accounts

54:19.340 --> 54:22.880
I've got my wife and I we don't share our last name. So it's a little bit different

54:22.880 --> 54:25.880
We have different accounts that aren't even shared and I'd like to manage all of that

54:26.880 --> 54:29.860
Through one but I might have some like custom stuff. I'd also like

54:29.860 --> 54:34.860
Access to some more of the data like what if I want to kind of compute some of my own metrics on there

54:35.100 --> 54:42.360
Mint doesn't make it that make it that easy. No export data or you know, so it it really I struggle with that too

54:42.360 --> 54:46.420
Because it's like well, I'm also very busy. I have I have a job doing similar things already, right?

54:46.420 --> 54:48.540
So it's like I don't have time every night to do

54:49.460 --> 54:53.340
Administration to get good deployment practices after all after you do this all day long

54:53.340 --> 54:58.500
Is that what you want to do when you go home? Yeah, sometimes it is sometimes it is and sometimes it's like it's totally worth it

54:58.500 --> 55:01.620
And I mean, I love playing with I love playing with digital ocean. I love setting things up

55:01.620 --> 55:02.780
I love that feeling of like yes

55:02.780 --> 55:07.060
I made it work and it's mine and there are some times where you like you set it up and it just works and you

55:07.180 --> 55:12.780
Forget about it. You have the sense. I you know this I can trust this that's super nice, especially when it's your accounting data

55:12.780 --> 55:16.280
Yes, right and so it may depend on you know, how how personal is it?

55:16.280 --> 55:22.380
How how private is it and how much you know, there are some things and you know, I've done both in the VPN case

55:22.380 --> 55:27.540
I do pay for a VPN service provider, but I also do sometimes throw out use a digital ocean one

55:27.540 --> 55:28.900
so

55:28.900 --> 55:30.900
You know, maybe there's room for both

55:31.340 --> 55:32.700
No

55:32.700 --> 55:39.260
Dude, should we should we not gloss over the fact that you have opted to do command-line accounting? Yeah, maybe not

55:39.260 --> 55:41.260
so tell me about this West because I

55:42.020 --> 55:44.320
Thought about this in two ways first. I thought

55:45.260 --> 55:46.580
Well, that's just freaking crazy

55:46.580 --> 55:50.980
That's just cuz you know, like I'm thinking about like how you really like when you're trying to reconcile or something like that

55:50.980 --> 55:54.260
that just sounds crazy, but then I thought back to the to the

55:54.260 --> 56:00.220
late 90s early 2000s when I was migrating users off of DOS and

56:00.620 --> 56:02.820
I was moving them over to Windows and

56:03.900 --> 56:06.980
About a year into it the bank that I was moving them at

56:07.860 --> 56:09.740
they decided

56:09.740 --> 56:15.760
That it would be better and faster for the end users that if they just kept using the old DOS

56:16.220 --> 56:19.140
program the old mainframe interface that they were using

56:19.140 --> 56:27.420
inside a window in Windows NT instead of using the GUI version because and this is a bank because the entering of

56:27.540 --> 56:32.180
transactions and all of that was faster in the command-line version for the staff than the GUI was and

56:32.820 --> 56:38.380
So I guess it's not totally crazy because I watched a whole user base switch to a GUI and then switch back to a text

56:38.380 --> 56:42.580
Very interesting. So what do you like about it? I guess I like that

56:42.580 --> 56:47.420
It's a little more we use this phrase all the time, but like a little more Unix philosophy where you know

56:47.420 --> 56:53.380
I understand text. I work with text all the time. Text is what a universal interface is what they say and

56:54.100 --> 56:56.060
There there is a certain amount of tedium to it

56:56.060 --> 57:00.180
Right like mint lets you roll a lot of this like it'll just do it and it just filters it

57:00.180 --> 57:05.280
But like in particular like one of the ones I use here is ledger, right and and you know

57:05.280 --> 57:08.120
A lot of people talk about how tedious is it is and it can be

57:08.500 --> 57:10.640
And it kind of depends on what you want to do, you know

57:10.640 --> 57:15.920
Like mint does a pretty good job of of classifying things ledger can do that too. It has some built-in like a little bit of

57:15.920 --> 57:21.240
Learning to try to classify things. There's also an import from your bank. So there's actually a really cool

57:22.120 --> 57:28.040
Python project called auto ledger auto sync which does I've got it working with several different banks

57:28.040 --> 57:31.480
it pulls it in you can set like how far back you want to pull it in and

57:32.160 --> 57:36.360
I've actually got it down to like what I think is a pretty reasonable workflow and it depends on what you want to do

57:36.360 --> 57:40.240
I think at the base level I just really appreciate like one, you know

57:40.240 --> 57:42.200
I have a math background but not an accounting background

57:42.200 --> 57:47.080
So it's been kind of fun to learn a little bit more about double-entry accounting and understanding how how this works

57:47.080 --> 57:50.680
Especially as someone who wants to you know, I want to make sure I do my finances, right?

57:50.680 --> 57:52.140
I want to be up and up on that

57:52.140 --> 57:55.300
So it's kind of helpful to be able to play with that a little bit in a safe environment where I'm not

57:55.960 --> 57:59.840
There's not so much going on. Like I it's especially you're talking like, you know

58:00.280 --> 58:04.400
Can you cash some of these other environments or if you've used like QuickBooks or stuff like some of these software?

58:04.400 --> 58:08.800
They're very complicated. There's a lot you can do and and you know, I do have a small business, but it's like I

58:08.800 --> 58:12.760
I don't I'm not an enterprise. I don't I don't have a ton of needs

58:12.760 --> 58:14.760
But what I really want to do is understand

58:15.080 --> 58:17.800
Where my money comes from and where it goes and I don't even you know

58:17.800 --> 58:22.680
You might not even need a huge breakdown of that but just being able to easily see like for different time periods

58:22.680 --> 58:25.880
What's my how my balance? What's my cash flow, you know?

58:26.120 --> 58:29.040
So is the process for you now when you need to do that?

58:29.040 --> 58:34.200
Do you SSH into a remote box that you've set up and that's actually that's the next part in mind

58:34.200 --> 58:36.320
I've been running it locally. I just will

58:36.320 --> 58:41.800
It's like a just a database you back up a file. Is it file based? How's it work? Yes, it's file base

58:41.800 --> 58:46.680
It's okay. It's a flat text file nice and you can kind of figure out which files it. Well, I really like that, right?

58:46.680 --> 58:48.800
So it's really easy to pack up you can throw now

58:48.800 --> 58:54.280
I can I can worry about encryption for the file but to have my important data and text, you know

58:54.280 --> 59:01.800
I always envision that that bunker scenario where the the entire infrastructure has come down and I'm tunneling in with my

59:01.800 --> 59:06.620
Flashlight and my shovel and I'm gonna rescue the data off that hard drive through a cheroot

59:07.480 --> 59:12.640
And if I can just read that data and not have to reinstall a program to get access to the data

59:12.640 --> 59:13.720
That's a huge win for me

59:13.720 --> 59:17.100
So I've really enjoyed this auto sync because it will do the job of just grabbing

59:17.320 --> 59:22.000
Each little transaction and then I can just go in and kind of correct it and and I have it set up in a way

59:22.000 --> 59:24.380
Where you will where you can have like you have your main

59:24.840 --> 59:28.800
file of your transactions or you can even split it up like this is this month or this is this year and then you make

59:28.800 --> 59:32.240
A new file and you can kind of consolidate that to like what was the net for that, you know

59:32.240 --> 59:36.920
That year at the end of it and then a lot of it's just like it provides a nice like once a weekend or you can

59:36.920 --> 59:42.360
Do whatever frequency you want obviously, but you know, I just go through I grab it grabs like the last week of transactions from my bank

59:42.360 --> 59:46.320
Accounts credit cards etc. I can it provides a great opportunity for me to just go look through that

59:46.320 --> 59:47.920
Make sure there's not any anomalous charges

59:47.920 --> 59:51.800
Most of the time it gets a lot of it right and then I can kind of just go through and be like, oh, yeah

59:51.800 --> 59:53.640
Well this store I know that's grocery

59:53.640 --> 01:00:00.600
It takes a half hour maybe 45 minutes and at the end everything's accounted for you can run lots of commands

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.600
it's very flexible in terms of reporting and

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:08.040
Then one that I've been I'd like to I'm playing with switching is H ledger, which is a half scale

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:13.720
Reimplantation. Yeah, that's great. It comes with like it has a CLI interface. It has

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:18.600
More of like a curses style interface. It has a web interface that has some graphs

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:23.080
Or a web interface, huh? Yeah, and so one of the other things I liked is like we at work

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.800
We use a lot of graphite or Grafana and other graphing solutions

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:30.120
And so I really like the idea like a huge thing for me is just understanding like this month

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:33.600
Do I have more money coming in than going out? And and what does that look like?

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.200
What is the slope of that graph? How does it change week by week?

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:41.760
And so the fact that I can just take this I can set up a cron job that just runs one ledger command that outputs

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:48.280
My balance or my you know, like my net transfers for the month spits that into Grafana or whatever tool you want

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:52.500
And then you can graph it however you need or you can throw it into a Google Drive document

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:57.280
Yeah, whatever you're able to use some of the same flexibility and tools you use for work to manage your finances

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:02.080
which is really kind of great so H ledger a simple precise plain text accounting and

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.480
That's sort of the perfect do-it-yourself hosted solution and I don't know where I'm at. So that seems like an obvious line. Okay, that's

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:16.500
That's something I'm gonna self host mm-hmm a VPN because I think here's why here's where I'm leaning

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:21.980
with my decision if I were using the VPN solely for the purposes of

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:25.940
Hiding what I'm doing online and

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:33.760
Keeping what I want to do private or even possibly getting into another country to get access to content

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:39.520
That's restricted right in that scenario too because I don't want to violate terms of service. I think I would self host

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:43.560
I think it unquestionably would be obvious. I should self host but in this scenario

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.440
my

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.880
Priorities I'd say my top three are

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.380
Find the fastest route around a proxy server. Yep. I

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.900
Think and the second one would probably be

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:04.760
Flexibility to choose different locations based on where I'm at in the RV

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.620
so if I travel to a different state I might need a

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:14.340
Different VPN endpoint and then I think my third one would be ease of use, right?

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:17.420
I was trying to decide if that's number two, but I think it's third one's ease of use and

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:23.380
It seems like air VPN is the better tool for those top three requirements

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:26.020
Because they have tons of servers for me to choose from

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:29.180
Which and do is great because they have a lot of things or similar companies

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:35.100
But not the same number of if I'm gonna build my own digital ocean droplet and run VPN

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:39.180
I'm probably only gonna build it on one droplet now you were talking about a way

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:43.660
I could potentially bounce it around to different droplets like the entire setup. Do you remember what that was?

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:48.580
I mean, there's lots of neat scripts, but I think that's kind of the power of do is if you were gonna do it

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:50.500
It might be nice to

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.900
Use the API just like to have like a template. Yes, right

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:58.740
I think that's what it was like a templates the template thing and I would ping the API and say spring spin this template up

01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:03.840
On the on the New York data center server because I'm closer to that server now exactly

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:08.660
and and then when I'm back on the west coast, I'd ping the API and but see to me that seems like

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:14.500
The downside to that is what I would lose out on is any kind of small modifications

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:18.940
I'd made between the that time and the last time I'd done the template and with air VPN

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:24.260
I just go in there choose my server download the new config and load it people that manage that and here's the other thing is

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:27.620
I what I had I've already done this is I have different regions now

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:30.260
I have a folder just called air VPN in my home directory

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:36.100
With each different regions servers that I can just connect to really quick and try and it doesn't require I do any other setup

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:37.300
I just have the file sitting there

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:41.300
I just and I have them all in I have three of them imported right now and I really like that

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:45.300
So I feel like that might be a better solution and I feel like they're a pretty solid company

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:47.560
I do I do wonder. Yeah, it does seem and you know

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.420
And there's a lot to be said about exporting the support export, you know all that stuff

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:56.900
Do they have other they have non open VP obviously open VPN script VPN, you know, that's a great question

01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:02.900
I didn't look yeah, you're right. Some people want that native exact sex support iOS has an Android can do it

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:07.620
There's some SSH tunnel based ones that are really slick. I think they're only open VPN based

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:12.700
Yeah, as far as I can tell but I might be wrong cuz I only I wanted open VPN, right?

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:16.820
I mean open VPN is great. There's apps for whatever platform. So yeah, like it's a huge problem

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:21.140
the other thing that's really nice is I was able to set up apps on other on other like

01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:25.780
Devices and whatnot. Look at this. They have top 10 users on your top 10 speed all that

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:29.700
So I really like how transparent they are with all of this because I can look at this and go

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:29.940
All right

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:33.460
Well, I'll connect to this server that only that has half the users and exact that's nice

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:37.940
That's really transparent. Of course, then again if I'd rolled my own it just be I'd be the only user

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:39.860
Yeah, so there's that too

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:46.260
Anybody in the mumble room have thoughts on VPN solutions or or my particular particular mint or West's accounting stuff before we move on?

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:51.060
Or even like how do you you know as someone who might be skilled like you can run it yourself

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:58.220
How do you decide if the trade-offs the effort is worth, you know, not impinging your freedom or whatever. That's a lot of questions, but

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.060
Everybody has thoughts because you guys haven't you guys haven't had a chance to jump in

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:09.260
How Al terrace is how do you describe something that runs by activists as a company? I

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:12.260
Don't know. They maybe they're not a company

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:17.420
They take my money and provide a service and they seem to be good at doing that right that way. Yeah, that's a good point

01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:24.420
Yeah, so it's air VPN a company or to donate or it's not a donation. No, it's not a donation

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:30.460
And I think they have a VAT ID so they must be I'm clicking on a rope

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:35.860
That takes me nowhere, but they do have a VAT ID. So they're and they're including taxes in there. So

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:39.100
You tell me that's nice. You tell me I could go there

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.700
because here's here's the other thing is

01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.500
I

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:48.340
Thought about attempting to go the whole route and totally anonymous because they allow anonymous login

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:53.620
They allow Bitcoin payments that I could send through a tumbler and then I thought about it just to really test that but you know

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.540
What I the thing is is if I'm being completely honest with you

01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:02.940
Security is not high on my list in this use case because my alternative is to send everything

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:07.720
I'm doing through a proxy server that's literally interrupting my it's it's man and mentally my HTTPS connections

01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:10.580
So and then adding a super cookie to all my traffic

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:14.500
So like the the upgrade in security for me is it's pretty yeah

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:20.140
So an another question that might be relevant here is like what about did they have do they let you have forwarded ports?

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.960
Yeah, there's a couple of options in there where you can do that

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:27.260
It does not a lot of options, but you can also you know again you get a private IP to that obviously

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:31.820
Hmm, I didn't check you're less anonymous in that regard. You're not sharing a server. Yeah, but that's one thing

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:35.260
I know some people wait for yeah. Yeah, I didn't check to see if they'd let you do that

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:38.580
But one of the things in the setup is that is the portfolio. So I was just reading here

01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:44.320
They say it's operated exclusively by activists privacy data protection and security issue aware persons

01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:48.060
law experts with the help of same lawyers and

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:54.920
Counts more than 80 servers with high bandwidth lines and good top hardware and 15 data centers across 16 countries in three continents

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.920
I'm picking up English is not the main language

01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:02.820
They have a great infrastructure. They saying customer service is not an ever been outsourced or to provide high quality of support

01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:06.320
There you go. I I'll keep playing around with it

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:10.540
I tell you what it came from some from some people I respect in our community, too

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:12.080
And that made me feel really good, too

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.380
It's definitely was recommended to me by some people that know their stuff

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:19.220
But I'll keep playing around that and then eventually I might break down and just roll my own

01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:21.220
I'll tell you what the tipping point would be is

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:28.700
Probably if I'm combining with another solution like a network-wide persistent VPN and when I'm ready to step up to like a persistent VPN

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:32.660
They don't fire up when I need it that might be when I go self hosted on do

01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:39.940
Right now I I have a very unique setup because I can't just replace my router with a pf sense box like the chat rooms

01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:43.300
Like right just do pf sense. That's easy. The issue there is

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:49.340
well, unless anybody if anybody has experience with the air card line of my fi devices and

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:52.340
Hooking that over USB with pf sense

01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:57.620
And that works shit. Let me know. That would be awesome. Maybe I'll just replace the cradle point with that

01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:01.300
But then and then if I go with a persistent one, I think that's one

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:04.020
That's where I would draw the line mama room any other thoughts before we move on

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:08.620
We do have one more thing. We actually gonna get to today, but you you guys have the last word

01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:13.220
Yeah, I wanted to clarify so you have one server and you can download

01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:20.100
Certificates and then you can jump countries according to your needs because you can be connected to one server only at a time

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:25.500
Right. Yes, essentially you you could you could have multiple setups, too

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:29.180
So you could have like your US server config file and your other country config file

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:35.140
And then you would just have two different VPN entries in network manager, and you would just choose whichever one you wanted for that

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.260
It's not really cool

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:43.900
It is nice. Yeah, I thought they I mean who knows maybe maybe it's a it's an mi6 operation for all I know

01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:49.540
But I thought I thought I liked the way they the way they set it up and I thought was worth checking out

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:50.620
But you know

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:57.820
Well, I think really one of the things that I always consider whenever I'm thinking about self hosting versus going with somebody who's obviously an expert

01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:02.420
And passionate about it is how well do I know the subject how prepared am I to maintain a box?

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:08.500
It's its infrastructure its security all of that all the responsibilities that come with that and I think that's something that

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:15.820
Probably Linux Academy could help with right next academy.com slash unplugged go learn the essentials and the advanced topics around

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:22.540
Linux so that way when you implement systems like this you do it correctly and it's funny too because it's really the small small stuff

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:24.980
it's the little things that add up and

01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:31.980
Really the key to good security is having as many of your eyes dotted and your t's crossed and really

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:36.940
Understanding what you're working with understanding the best practices. See that's it right there. Like you really can't like

01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:41.740
As two people who've like taught themselves a lot of things you can learn how to do things, right?

01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:46.460
But it's hard to trade that experience with someone was like I do this day in day out every day and I need systems to

01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:51.300
Be secure and they can just show you like the little mistakes that you're making. That's the things you haven't thought of honestly

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:59.260
there's I had a very private humble pie moment in my career because I got so far into my career being self-taught and

01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:05.980
Then I started playing the corporate game of wanting to get good reviews and promotions and started going to get training and they you know

01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:09.740
Of course, there was training budgets and why aren't you using this training budget? We make this training budget available

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:11.980
Okay, I'll go spend your money

01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:17.300
and so I went to school and I went took a course by a man named Grant Williams at Edmonds Community College

01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.940
shout out to grant who sometimes listens and

01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:26.660
Learned that there was lots of little tiny things that I never really I just blew right past I just you know

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:30.500
I'm a touch you there's so much. Yeah, it's not that it's not that I was dumb

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.180
It's not that I couldn't figure it out or look it up

01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:37.560
It's that I never really was presented with a particular need and so therefore I never quite got that

01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:41.340
Aspect of it and so going through and doing the things that you had to do in a class

01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:45.260
Really sort of opened up my eyes and showed me that okay

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:50.300
There was a couple of things I've missed but by being self-taught and now I can add these tools to my toolset

01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:54.940
That was extremely valuable and it's it's genuinely like that for just about every damn topic

01:10:54.940 --> 01:11:01.500

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:26.900
Thanks Linux Academy. Alright, so I I'll I don't want to go too far in this without bringing in the mumble room

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:28.900
Cuz this is sort of the segment. I wanted to give them a chance to shine

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:31.540
However, I got to ask you. I

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:36.360
Don't think I actually know the answer this question either. I was just trying to think if I knew what you were gonna say

01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:39.940
Do you

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:41.940
Today

01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:43.940
Use the Linux desktop

01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:49.180
for idealistic reasons or for purely pragmatic practical reasons

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:54.940
Today it is that different than when you first tried Linux. I

01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:59.660
Think I've kind of come full circle

01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:02.460
You know, I grew up kind of playing with Windows

01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:08.420
I remember trying to change the like Windows boot screen and breaking the family computer for a while that kind of thing and you quickly

01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:12.740
figure out like what you can and what you cannot change with Windows and so like started out as this like

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:16.180
Wonderful playground and like I knew what open source was

01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:19.660
I thought it was cool because I kind of like started trying to program but it was it didn't mean a lot

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:21.420
I couldn't really use it to do any you know what I mean?

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:24.220
Like I mean I could do a lot and I loved all this software, but it was like

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:29.700
This is just fun this and let me like really deep dive and I think somewhere in the middle there. I

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:35.300
Really stuck around because I mean at some point I started going to school and like well

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.300
I mean Linux was very important for that

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:39.980
You know, you can write a paper on just about any operating system

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:44.620
So I think it really the the idle ideology it really did

01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:49.940
It really did sink in you know, and you know, it made me maybe want to try more distributions

01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:53.900
It made me want to try to you know, you can play with 3BSD or something else

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:57.620
Look at the little different ideology, but I think today I

01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:01.220
Don't think there's another platform where I could get what I need to get done

01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:05.100
Like there's definitely both parts like both parts are very important. I think the ideology is

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:08.380
It's important. I think freedom is important

01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:09.660
I think open source is important

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:11.300
But it's also just I need it

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:17.980
I need an operating system that is malleable and where I can change things and like the ideology definitely informs that but at some day

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:22.180
Be it as long as it is free. I think I can make it work, you know

01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:27.420
Okay. All right. So let's let's bounce to the mumble room and I'll give you my thoughts. So BC I'll let you go first

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:35.460
Uh, well, do you use it today for ideal idealistic or practical reasons? And is that how you started using Linux? Yeah

01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:38.700
The first time I installed Linux it was like 15 years ago

01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:46.060
Yes coming directly from Windows. I started just wanted to check out what exactly it is

01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:51.820
Right now as I use Linux full-time. I'm just much more productive with it

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:59.340
However, it's not just productive because I try to use as little closed software as possible

01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:02.380
so

01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:08.140
In reality both. Yeah, it is an interesting thing there too because you can kind of reach a limit where you're like

01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:10.780
well, I want to be free and then sometimes you hit that area where you're like, well

01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:15.500
My operating system is free, but this application is proprietary and I need it

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:20.420
Yeah, I use Windows for some things for example game development. I use

01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:23.020
KVM with GPU pass-through

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:25.740
unfortunately

01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:32.380
Yeah, okay. All right good and it sounds kind of like sort of a similar similar situation uber panda. I want to hear your thoughts

01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:35.780
Yes, I started using

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:41.380
Linux because of battery life reasons my laptop and Windows lasted like one hour

01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:47.060
And I just started using option X and it lasted for two and a half hours. So I

01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:49.060
Ha ha and

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:53.660
Then I understood what what was free software that kind of thing

01:14:53.660 --> 01:15:01.300
So it became an ideology and now I think free software is good and Windows is also a terrible operating system

01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:03.300
So I use Linux for both reasons

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:09.180
Yeah, interesting. I love it. I think that's pretty I think that actually makes a lot of sense now. Okay, mr. Heaven

01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:14.740
So it sounds like you've been around the block a couple of times including over to the free BSD camp and then ended back on

01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:19.380
Linux so is that for idealism or is that because just made more sense practically speaking?

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:24.140
Well, the reason why I went or at least let's say

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:27.060
During my first bit of open source

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:33.220
adventures, of course, I like the technical things so I went on to a you know

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:40.180
Adventure and benchmarking a whole bunch of file systems. I found XFS while I was on Linux and I loved it

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:46.440
The thing is my philosophy is closer to the BSD philosophy versus the Linux one

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:52.980
So I actually went over to desktop BSD and whatever that other one was and free BSD

01:15:54.500 --> 01:16:01.380
Thing is the XFS port wasn't up to stuff. It wasn't up-to-date enough. So even though I love free SP's

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:02.980
philosophy of

01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:05.900
True freedom it allows you to keep secrets

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:11.020
If you want a Linux pretty much prevents you from keeping secrets if you you know

01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:14.140
Regardless if you want to or not other in the LG PL

01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:19.620
So I went back to Linux because of XFS because all of my storage was XMS

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:25.620
It didn't like free BSD didn't actually, you know provide what I needed. So that's was stable. That's a practical

01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:32.340
That'd be a practical reason there. Yeah, that is actually a practical reason, you know, it's slightly philosophical. Yeah. Oh, man, that's so interesting

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.580
alright many MC your

01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:36.500
practical or

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:39.620
Idealism for your initial adoption of Linux and where you're at today

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:46.060
So I wanted to know something new I started with Linux 2 say 6 1

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:53.220
I just wanted to see something new and all missing stuff was really hard to replace and then

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:58.500
From time to time it became a feature. So now Linux changed my whole workflow

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:05.380
So it stripped me down to the basics much faster much clearer in my book flow than I was before I guess

01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:08.380
Interesting. Yeah, I know

01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:11.620
what's been interesting for me just on the workflow part is

01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:19.060
I've had the opportunity now of moving a couple of different types of workflows onto Linux started as just moving like desktop

01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:26.500
Microsoft workflow like the office and outlook basic getting that running on Linux doing and doing interacting with Windows file shares and that

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.860
Workflow was a major workflow and I it took me a while

01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:34.540
I mean it took me a while to make that more efficient under Linux right to be able to justify

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:37.260
Running Microsoft applications on our links, but I got there

01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:40.860
I eventually got there and then I moved I went as a consultant

01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:45.740
I had to move that workflow onto Linux when I did IT consulting for a while and then

01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:49.500
You know just here at Jupiter broadcasting

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:53.420
There have been so many workflows that are sort of they start with the Mac

01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:59.360
And then I was like I have to move this to Linux and definitely one of the biggest ones for me was my unfilter

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:04.980
Clip editing and workflow because that just it started out as such a Mac centric

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:09.740
just a couple of tools that I just hated using and it just was a mess and

01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:13.220
moving that over to the Linux and finding that to be and

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.940
In being able to then use all of my you know

01:18:15.940 --> 01:18:17.580
My my traditional Linux skills

01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:22.460
on the command line and be able to take advantage of things like quake and be able to take advantage of things like avid mux and

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:26.420
Being able to install codecs that you know by just a command away, right?

01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:29.860
It made it very practical in that case to move that workflow over there

01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:32.860
So that work full element and be and just because I have a better workflow

01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:36.940
Sometimes is it is enough of a reason it's and more options and how you make them. Yeah

01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:41.300
So rotten I wanted to hear your practical or idealism

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:50.820
Well, I started as practicality thing because I was a beta tester for Windows 7 for about a year before it was released and

01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:54.900
And when it was when it came to the point where they were about to release it

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:57.500
They said all beta testers now had to pay for it

01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:04.100
So and it wasn't like, you know, you had a certain amount of time to pay for it. They stopped your Windows 7. Oh, yeah

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:06.300
Oh, yeah, that's right

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:12.100
Yeah, so it was completely like just stripped away from me and they gave me I think like a week ahead of time

01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:20.260
You're going to lose the access to you run the system that you've been working for free to fix bugs and and you know

01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:22.260
find problems that we've we've

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:25.140
obviously have not finished fixing yet Wow, and

01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:30.940
Then it to the point where I was just like, you know what out of spite screw it and I was already dual booting at

01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:35.580
the time, but then I just kind of like just wiped it and went to the Linux way and

01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:39.740
Been there the whole time and now it's become both

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:43.100
I didn't really know what the ideology was at the time

01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:47.220
Exactly, right? Yeah, it's hard to pick up on now. Yeah. Yeah

01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:52.140
So now it's more like the I the ideology made me stay in the practicality made me come over

01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:55.340
That's a good way to put it land rash. I wanted to hear your

01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:58.860
Ideology versus practicality where you started where you ended up

01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:04.900
Probably started in school with well using it when I needed to from course and stuff

01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:12.900
Going over to practicality when I got used to it and basically getting the only way I could do things was with Linux because I needed

01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:18.780
The tools I had the tools I needed there. I'm going to win. So like shoot myself in the foot and doing it ten times slower

01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:25.900
I think we've all been there. Yeah, isn't he's finding that schools pretty cool. Okay, mr. Ranger. How about yourself?

01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:32.060
Yeah, I I'm another one that I started out practical because you know back in the late 90s early 2000s

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:38.180
Worked at a computer shop where we needed easy internet sharing and IP chains was where it was at nice

01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:43.060
Um, we similar to your banking story. We had a point-of-sale system that

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:50.180
Was crashy and the networking on it was horrible and oddly enough. The perfect solution was run to run it in DOS box

01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:56.220
And even to this day just a few months ago

01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:04.020
was an officiant of my sister's wedding and I needed some random government form and I was trying to figure out how to

01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:06.820
modify this the way that I needed and

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:13.060
The scribes was you know one command line install away so I'd say practically

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:19.540
You know Linux is so easy to get software for and so easy to find software that does, you know

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:24.060
Whatever task you need that day. So for me way practical cool

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:30.140
I think that's an interesting thread like in what what Swift 110 here is is commenting like it's interesting how I

01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:33.860
Mean practical so different like there's a lot of like enterprise cases or like, you know

01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:39.060
If you're a creative type where it's less practical because the tools you need are proprietary and expensive

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:43.380
But there's a lot of other cases where the ideology of freely available makes for these

01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:48.980
If you're if you're underprivileged if you just you don't know you're out of budget for the quarter

01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:50.980
And you really have a problem that you want to get solved

01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:54.420
Free software is there for you. Yeah. Yeah, it really is. I

01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:58.260
Think I'm gonna touch on that when I all share mine here at the end

01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:05.300
But I I'm glad ww wants to share his to go ahead ww with yours. So I started back in red hat

01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:08.660
5.1 in 96 97. Yeah

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:13.740
We didn't have I didn't have lunch back then I looked in the desert

01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:20.260
So I was lucky enough to have friends that were into Linux and into ham radios

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:23.660
And you can walk into a software cetera and buy

01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:27.940
Mandrake Linux or whatever or if you weren't lucky enough

01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:32.980
You can have an independent ISP and order limits online and get it

01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:36.300
And so I think I should have been on it longer

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:41.420
I should have been on it before since Windows 3.1 because I always like to get

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:48.620
Dig into the system and figure out how it's running and when it's doing and how to change it or how to move it around

01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:50.700
So for me practically

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:55.140
It's been something that I've been striving to be to be more on even though I've been

01:22:55.740 --> 01:23:01.240
Someone that dual boots and still uses Windows for what I really need to do

01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:08.460
It's ultimately where I hope I end up is more on Linux and I'm not sure about the idea

01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:11.940
Ideological side. I like to be more pragmatic

01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:13.900
So for me

01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:20.900
It's more of a practical reason to be on Linux and that makes more sense in the long term than being stuck on a closed

01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:23.460
system that you will never

01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:31.820
Be able to open and openly use a way you believe it should be used. Yeah, so long term for me, I think

01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:34.620
It's gonna be practical bit

01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:38.580
maybe once I I get a chance to

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:45.340
Read more into the ideological stuff. It will be both for me right now. It's all more of a practical reason

01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:45.540
You know

01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:50.180
I think what I'm what I'm really picking up and it echoes mine is you sometimes you come at it from

01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:54.660
What's feels like a very practical reason and then you get there and you discover the philosophy

01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:56.740
so I'll tell you you know mine really started as

01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:59.260
a need to solve a

01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:05.180
limitation of Windows Windows just simply at the time Windows NT 4 was not good enough for the job

01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:09.540
I needed it to do and so I had to find another solution started very practical

01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:16.000
I and you would I think particularly for me if you if you watch it if you watch the back catalog of the Linux action show

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:21.940
with this in mind, you can see where I switch from a pragmatist to more of an idealist and

01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:29.980
Now I'm on Linux simply because I can't stand to use any other platform I couldn't I couldn't imagine having to use

01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:32.660
Windows as my daily driver. I don't know what I would do

01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:38.660
so I you could claim that's practical, but I think really I'm here now for the idealism and I'll tell you

01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:43.540
If for me, it took a while for it to sink in mostly because there were so many problems

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:46.060
I needed to solve and it didn't really hit me

01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:53.180
until I started thinking about it in the way that affected my own bottom line and then then it clicked and it was really in

01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:54.740
the sense of

01:24:54.740 --> 01:25:01.860
My clients kept getting screwed over by companies like Microsoft and many other proprietary companies that would just

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:08.180
Extort them for support contracts that were unbelievable and that would change and drop features at

01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:12.980
At a moment's notice and completely leave them off on this old version

01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:17.540
That was no longer supported for a decade because the next version up completely

01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:21.320
uplifted their workflow and what I what I

01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:28.280
Discovered over time both in a sense of software and hardware and in contracts is that vendor lock-in can be

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:33.540
Paralyzing for a company sometimes and so that was in which the lens that I first looked at

01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:40.100
the advantages that open that a core open source infrastructure gives you the kind of

01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:45.320
visibility into the long-term viability or even the emergency eject lever of

01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:50.620
Forking and maintaining it by hiring your own developer really interesting business case for like you get a lot of freedom

01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:58.140
It's huge because I can tell you you can deploy your infrastructure on this and worst case scenario if they stop making this thing

01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:00.380
You can go hire a developer and that

01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:06.140
Developer can continue the thing because all of the code is completely free and open source and for an enterprise

01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:10.500
That's not a crazy proposition if you already have developers prop or they can yes

01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:13.780
Yes, and if it's a core piece of their business that makes them money

01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:17.260
They they like having that flexibility and so is with that

01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:21.460
Perspective that looking at open source the way that it would solve that problem that I realized. Oh

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:29.740
Shit, this is the killer feature. It's it's not the great package management. It's not the stability. It's not the security

01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:37.320
It's not the transparency. It's not all of the incredible minds that are and diverse opinions that are contributing to this. It's this

01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:44.940
fundamental open license this GPL that is the actual killer feature of this platform and

01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:51.340
What it took me a while to get there, but is now it is based upon that which I look at everything else

01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:57.360
I I you can't have a practical Linux desktop experience without the idealist without that

01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:01.240
GPL without that idealism that led to the GPL and the GNU stack

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:06.340
You can't have the full practical Linux desktop with which is a sensible reason that we're all using it

01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:11.940
Wouldn't exist without that and so it was once I once I sort of made that sort of transition that revelation

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:15.380
I realized oh, I'm actually I'm actually an idealist and

01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:21.820
when I make decisions based on that in the long run those always tend to be the ones that pay out and

01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:26.980
The one when I make a decision that's not oriented towards that it tends to screw me eventually

01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:30.380
And that has been that has bared out in my personal life for stuff

01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:34.700
I just use myself and it's bared out my professional life with my clients and whatnot and you know

01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:40.700
I'm very very very very very proud of the fact that I can go back to almost any of my clients at any of the

01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:44.920
Linux and open source solutions that I implemented are still maintainable and supportable today

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:49.760
It's awesome and I cannot write our solutions cannot work that way cannot do that

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:54.200
it's literally not possible because aging them out is part of the process and

01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:59.320
Locking you into their support path because that's where they make all of their money in the enterprise is part of the process

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:05.100
And so it took that kind of that particular doorway in which I saw it then it really sort of lit up for me

01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:09.280
But my it was very mad these two are you know, like I feel like a lot of people

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:12.660
It's that that that pragmatism especially if you're I feel like networking is a huge part

01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:16.060
We're like, you know my internet gateway and I feel like it actually that's a more solid foundation

01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:18.500
Because if you're just in it for the idealism

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:24.860
Then that idealism is gonna last you as long until you want to watch something on Netflix or you're gonna watch a TV show

01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:27.980
I mean, where do you draw the line at that point? Do you do you abandon all all?

01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:34.780
Proprietary lockdown media all together cuz you that's kind of pretty hard and maybe you do and maybe that works for you

01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:37.340
But to me it seems like that eventually after a certain amount of time

01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:39.340
Unless you're freaking Richard Stallman himself

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:45.760
You're gonna give that damn eventually is gonna break and then what do you have if all you have is the idealism, right?

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:48.580
If there's not the pragmatic thing, you're also grounded with I

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:54.180
Feels like it's not quite as strong as a grip. You can't get anything done. Then what's the point? Yeah

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:58.820
Yeah, so it's a fascinating topic and it's a there's a couple it popped up a couple of times on reddit

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:03.360
In the last couple of days and so we thought we'd ask it here in the show and I'd like to hear your stories to

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:09.160
Linux action show dot reddit.com. Please go with that great forum. Yeah, and episode 154

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:13.200
We'll have a feedback thread in there and or you can always join us and chat with us in our mumble room

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:20.320

And then you'll get the server information

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:31.440
I don't know what that means then just ask in the friendly IRC if you don't know what that means

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:36.320

Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of the unplugged program, and we'll see you right back here next week

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Oh

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:20.320
Well, there we go now that was a lot of show but we've been having some long ones recently some long one

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:23.000
What's going on with your screen over there? Oh, there's just a smudge on it

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.760
Oh, I thought maybe you spilled some beer

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:29.920
We've been we've been haunted by that before JB titles calm. Thank you mama room. You guys are great

01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:36.200
We had someone so we had such good participation in that last segment you guys

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:40.240
That was I had to write the names down and if everybody did so I could keep note of who had pinged me in the chat

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:43.920
Room with mom. I just wrote them all down and went through one by one. So thank you guys

01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:48.200
We need some sort of software for that we do hmm JB titles

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:55.600
Just a note you can call me mini Mac like Mexico mini Mac or like like a mini not so

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:57.840
mini Mac like the Mac mini

01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:03.160
No, not like the Mac mini like mini Mac. It's it's French like little guy

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.840
Like a Mac like a Mac warrior

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:12.800
Like a Mac warrior or Mexico or a McDonald's sandwich mini Mac. Okay, I got it

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:14.800
I don't like

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:17.960
Surprise surprise. Oh, yes

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.680
Idealistic Linux desktop practical VPN package sharing ideas and practices Linux pragmatic idealism. That's interesting

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:33.000
JB titles JB titles now y'all gotta go bang suggest or else you'll be eliminated. What I

01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:39.680
Didn't nothing. No, just just have the pill. Don't worry about the color of the pill. Just enjoy just a sugar pill trust

01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:45.840
We bought it for you. Yes. I know it burns just swallow. All right, man unfilter is gonna be so packed tomorrow

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:50.800
It's gonna be crazy. Yeah, I it really it really is

01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:55.600
It really is Matt and I have been working on it every single day

01:32:57.080 --> 01:33:04.640
So I'm not kidding you not exaggerating I got off the air I didn't even finish putting the show tags in we didn't

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:12.280
We didn't pop the up the episode wasn't even finished editing and I was already collecting clips for the next episode

01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:14.800
I I don't think I was off-air for 15 minutes

01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:21.680
From the last week's unfilter before I started working on tomorrow's unfilter. Yeah, it's show is out of control

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:24.960
It's nuts. It's nuts

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:29.760
I'm gonna have to just go big picture on something. It's just so much to cover that it would be a three-hour show. I

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:35.320
Don't know. All right. It's something I have to pick and choose you do and then that's that's sort of dark in some ways

01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:39.480
Cuz some of the stuff I have to choose not to talk about I don't know. It's right and you're not saying it's not important

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:41.480
Yeah, yeah. Yeah

01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:50.240
So here's what's floating up Linux pragmatic idealism Oh snap, where's wimpy and poppy that's clever I idealistic Linux desktop

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:52.640
rotten's rotten past

01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:59.980
Aha packet practical VPN package sharing ideas and practice. I do like Linux pragmatic idealism. Mm-hmm. Oh

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:05.560
Whoa, that was a good one. I was surprised. That's my first one. I know this has been super buzzy a bubbly beer

01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:08.240
I'm really surprised the VPN of things. That's cute. Ww

01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:14.080
But you know what I'm talking about when I say like I think this is what's gonna push snap packages over the edge is

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:16.680
app image and

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:19.320
flat packs and what's the other one this

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:27.120
The other one like app image there's orbitals and what's the other one there's one more oh, yeah, I'm blank

01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:35.540
Yeah, Ben that Jon Stewart skit and on Stephen Colbert skit have you seen that hmm what that was crazy that was

01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:42.400
Amazing that was so funny. I was I literally was laughing. I don't I don't do that at the TV

01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:47.080
I was cackling laughing out loud at the spit tank stuff like that

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:52.880
Yep, and what's so great is it would it would admit what amazes me that it managed to be funny when there was like a 30

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:59.400
Second built like, you know, it's coming, you know, it's coming and it's still happens and you still laugh and it's those two together

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:05.700
Are they just they have the timing they've inherently mapped each other's timing so well. Yep. It's just wow, man

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:07.560
Like one weird person

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:13.480
JB titles JB titles every titles. So should we go with Linux pragmatic idealism? Should we do that?

01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:17.680
I mean people seem to like it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:25.300
I'm looking forward to some Linux in like should be there should be possessive. No Linux is pragmatic idealism

01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:28.440
Hmm. There's also just pragmatic idealism somewhere down there

01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:32.200
Well, that's not bad that one but

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:39.000
You know the WWF WWF sex beat me to it. But yeah Linux unplugged is already Linux in the title

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:44.800
Right. Yeah Linux unplugged. So you could just go with pragmatic idealism. I like the way you guys think

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:48.640
Linux community snaps together. Oh

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:54.280
So, where's the shorter one where's that at

01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:02.240
It's North Ranger pragmatic idealism by North Ranger. Yep. Alright, so yeah, it's already it's already got five boats by the time I got to it

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:07.800
Yeah, I Stephen Colbert coming out as Colbert right that you do you know, you knew they were gonna have to eventually do that

01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:11.560
Yeah, I mean, it's just too good. Hey, yeah, it's it's great. It's great

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:19.040
You're gonna have an opening dance numbers and stuff into the show. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:26.160
Well, I got him. He technically gave up on the pronunciation of his name because originally it was Colbert versus Colbert

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:31.240
Right character in himself, right? He's like nah, screw it. It's Colbert everywhere. Yeah, and he's like

01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:32.560
Yeah

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:39.840
That's fine. I think it's been interesting to watch him sort of ease into just let like when he first started doing the the night

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:44.800
The tonight show what's it called? It's not called the anyway, so the late show we first started doing the late show

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:49.320
I think he was very awkwardly trying to totally not be that character

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:53.440
And now as he's been then doing it for a while and the elections are here

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:57.200
He's letting more of that old character and and it does seem to be playing well to the audience

01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:04.040
Because I think there's like you can have a little of that and still be a different show. Yeah. Yeah. Well and plus it's

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:11.000
When you're on the CBS versus the Comedy Central, it's it's a totally different you could I mean

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:16.280
I think you I could think you could reuse a lot of that stuff and it's it's such a huge newer audience that I

01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:18.680
Wouldn't blame them

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:22.120
Alright, so I we're gonna we're gonna go with so so I'm gonna refresh the bolts here

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:27.880
Let's see pragmatic idealism is almost number one now. So I think that's that's rocket away up there. So go with that

01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:30.800
We'll go with it. All right. Thank you. Mr. Ranger. Thank you and

01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:38.240
Ww yeah, yeah tip my hat to him. All right. Thank you everyone. Oh you guys, you know what else?

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:55.800
Thanks to the audience. Oh my that audio data. Thanks audience. Oh my gosh. All right
