WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
How about this one, Wes?

00:03.840 --> 00:10.920
A new way to attack Internet of Things systems is with some sort of wireless Doppler effect?

00:10.920 --> 00:13.520
It's not really, come on, not really.

00:13.520 --> 00:14.760
Did you grok anything from this?

00:14.760 --> 00:18.860
Yeah, okay, so it may be that there are some attacks here, but it can also be useful just

00:18.860 --> 00:20.200
for communication.

00:20.200 --> 00:23.720
And the central insight is protocols are robust, right?

00:23.720 --> 00:26.240
So like a lot of stuff, think like FM radio, right?

00:26.240 --> 00:30.920
You do frequency zone modulations that you're sort of shifting frequencies, but nothing's

00:30.920 --> 00:31.920
exact, right?

00:31.920 --> 00:34.760
There's all kinds of interference when you're sending out signals in Wi-Fi or Bluetooth

00:34.760 --> 00:35.760
low energy.

00:35.760 --> 00:36.760
Oh, for sure.

00:36.760 --> 00:39.320
So the protocols and algorithms have plans for that.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.000
They can handle some drift there.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.960
So this is a new technique that basically abuses that and injects what looks like valid

00:45.960 --> 00:51.840
legacy traffic or repeats valid legacy traffic with slight modifications to the frequency,

00:51.840 --> 00:54.000
which bypasses any sort of the checks.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.640
So with intolerance for stuff like whatever your physical layer, the actual Wi-Fi chipset

00:57.640 --> 01:01.600
or the Bluetooth chipset, and then that data, once it's in the hand of something a little

01:01.600 --> 01:04.680
bit higher in the stack, can be coded as actual communication.

01:04.680 --> 01:08.240
And one of the problems that they're trying to solve is you have a whole bunch of IoT

01:08.240 --> 01:14.040
devices with Bluetooth low energy that can't talk that far, but you have Wi-Fi that's permeating

01:14.040 --> 01:15.040
the area.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.040
All the things.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.860
With this, maybe you could tie them together.

01:17.860 --> 01:37.040
That's your Science Moment with Wes.

01:37.040 --> 01:42.260
Welcome into Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that has not one, but multiple

01:42.260 --> 01:43.720
celebrations this week.

01:43.720 --> 01:44.720
My name is Chris.

01:44.720 --> 01:45.720
My name is Wes.

01:45.720 --> 01:46.720
Hello, Wes.

01:46.720 --> 01:47.720
We really have a great show.

01:47.720 --> 01:49.120
We have some things to celebrate this week.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.720
We'll tell you about that in just a moment.

01:51.720 --> 01:56.080
But as always, we've got some great community news that will probably spur some discussion

01:56.080 --> 01:57.680
with our virtual lug.

01:57.680 --> 02:01.720
And then later on in the show, some are saying desktop Linux is collapsing, that it's in

02:01.720 --> 02:02.720
trouble.

02:02.720 --> 02:07.360
It has a motivation problem in development, and it has an adoption problem.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.840
And some statistics actually back that up.

02:09.840 --> 02:14.680
We'll look at these sobering numbers and then get into a wider conversation about the future

02:14.680 --> 02:20.360
of Linux desktop and how it might look a little different than maybe what we're used to, what

02:20.360 --> 02:21.360
we're expecting, you might say.

02:21.360 --> 02:23.480
We'll tell you more about that in a little bit if we get there.

02:23.480 --> 02:27.240
But before we go any further, it is my duty to bring in that virtual lug.

02:27.240 --> 02:28.240
Time appropriate greetings.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.240
Mumble room.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.240
Hello.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.240
Hello.

02:31.240 --> 02:32.240
Hello.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.400
I hear an L in cheese in there too.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.400
Hello to you guys.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.720
Nice to have you guys.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.400
Nice to have you there.

02:37.400 --> 02:41.880
L is our community architect, and cheese is the designer here at the Jupyter Broadcasting

02:41.880 --> 02:42.880
Network.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.960
The Linux Academy, what, about a month ago now, cheese?

02:44.960 --> 02:46.680
It's been about 30 days or so?

02:46.680 --> 02:47.680
Yeah.

02:47.680 --> 02:49.160
The 11th will be a month.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.160
Huh.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.160
Gosh.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.160
And you've already done so much.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.160
Yeah.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.160
We'll get to that.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.600
But Brandon's here in the mumble room as well as Mini Mac, and I see Neon Popey, of course.

02:56.600 --> 02:57.600
Not regular Popey.

02:57.600 --> 02:58.600
We don't want him.

02:58.600 --> 03:02.160
You got PieCrash in there, Social Happiness from System76 in there rocking it out, Tats

03:02.160 --> 03:03.720
in there as well, Turth and Wimpy.

03:03.720 --> 03:05.320
So we have a great showing.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.320
Amazing.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.320
We have a great showing.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.640
Something that I've actually been really enjoying recently is we've been able to start the show

03:10.640 --> 03:13.120
out with some birthday announcements.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.120
Yeah.

03:14.120 --> 03:17.400
So this is like now three weeks in a row, right?

03:17.400 --> 03:18.400
It's a record.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.400
It is.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.400
It is.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.400
This is super cool.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.720
So first of all, happy birthday to my co-host, Mr. Wes Payne.

03:22.720 --> 03:23.800
Oh, thank you very much.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.280
Today is Wes's birthday.

03:25.280 --> 03:27.360
We just got done celebrating with a little podcast grilling.

03:27.360 --> 03:29.120
We did a great job too.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.120
Killed it.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.120
Perfect birthday present.

03:31.120 --> 03:32.120
Killed it.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.120
Killed it.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.280
So if we fall asleep halfway through the show, it's from the meat sleeps.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.000
So happy birthday to you, Wes.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
It's awesome that you're here today on your birthday.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.720
I can't think of a place I'd rather be.

03:41.720 --> 03:42.720
Oh, shucks.

03:42.720 --> 03:46.280
And also happy 14th anniversary to good old Git.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.280
Happy birthday.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.280
That's right.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.280
Yeah.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.280
We're super excited here in the studio.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.800
We have a lot of people in studio today.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.480
I have them behind the soundproof door right now.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.680
So we've closed off the studio from the rest of the party.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.800
Today we are doing our official launch party on air.

04:03.800 --> 04:07.400
And so there's probably 60 to 70 people, more people arriving outside the studio right now.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.600
We better hurry up because there's not enough air to go around.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.720
There's one speaker out there.

04:10.720 --> 04:11.920
We said you can't come in the studio.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.200
We're closing the soundproof door.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.760
We don't want to hear you.

04:14.760 --> 04:15.760
There's one speaker.

04:15.760 --> 04:20.560
You can all huddle around if you want to listen and otherwise eat your meat.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.040
That's pretty much it.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.240
So we'll get to that in a little bit.

04:23.240 --> 04:28.960
But I thought maybe we should start with a little community news this week as we do here

04:28.960 --> 04:31.440
on the old podcast.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.920
And we have some interesting data now.

04:33.920 --> 04:34.920
Look back at it.

04:34.920 --> 04:40.560
It's been a few months since Proton released and one graph really kind of sums it up.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.120
We'll have it linked in the show notes.

04:42.120 --> 04:46.480
Seven to eight months ago, Proton comes out and now we have some major milestones, don't

04:46.480 --> 04:47.480
we?

04:47.480 --> 04:48.480
Yeah, we do.

04:48.480 --> 04:49.480
Okay.

04:49.480 --> 04:52.680
September 2018 was the biggest jump in compatibility by far.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.240
And that kind of makes sense if you think about what happened around that time around

04:56.240 --> 05:00.840
announcements and the work that had just been put in on the platform and then less spectacular

05:00.840 --> 05:05.280
but steady improvements around up until the end of the last year.

05:05.280 --> 05:09.580
Now January and February of this year were pretty calm.

05:09.580 --> 05:12.080
Only one new Proton release basically in all of mid-February.

05:12.080 --> 05:20.900
March 2019 though is special because we saw a release of Proton 4.2 at the very end.

05:20.900 --> 05:24.000
But it was still sufficient to bring enough new reports.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.600
I guess the picture here is there's been less hype, right?

05:27.600 --> 05:32.480
We've talked about Proton but kind of because we're all still thinking about it, not because

05:32.480 --> 05:35.000
there's been so much movement on their side.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.920
It's been like a slow and steady where it's this weird thing where different aspects of

05:38.920 --> 05:40.520
the stack get updated at different times.

05:40.520 --> 05:43.320
So it's kind of hard to track from like an enthusiast standpoint unless you're really

05:43.320 --> 05:45.320
following it closely.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.880
But I think the net result of the work is pretty good.

05:48.880 --> 05:53.720
The net result is there's a lot of Windows games that didn't formally work on Linux that

05:53.720 --> 05:56.280
now are playing great under Proton.

05:56.280 --> 06:00.600
Actually from that perspective it feels like a different world now that we're in the post-Proton

06:00.600 --> 06:01.600
era.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.240
That's why I was kind of surprised that they painted this picture this way.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.280
It's only really a start though.

06:06.280 --> 06:10.840
I think that's sort of the expectation to remember is it's only, we're not even a year

06:10.840 --> 06:11.840
into it.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.840
I mean there are still many games, especially a lot of games that maybe are less popular,

06:14.840 --> 06:18.840
some niche markets that just aren't well served by any of this and there are just some pathological

06:18.840 --> 06:20.920
cases where it's not going to work.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.000
So it's all well and good to say like look at how far we've come.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.800
I think there's still plenty of Linux users who wish they could stop dual booting.

06:26.800 --> 06:27.800
Yeah.

06:27.800 --> 06:28.800
Yeah.

06:28.800 --> 06:29.800
Yeah I think that's probably true.

06:29.800 --> 06:37.160
While we're talking about games, not related to Valve at all, but Lutris, which is another

06:37.160 --> 06:41.440
like a game platform alternative, has another update.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.080
They've been cranking them out recently.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.240
So check this out.

06:44.240 --> 06:47.760
This is another great way they have, I can't remember quite what it's called, because I

06:47.760 --> 06:51.400
use Lutris sparingly, but I think it's pretty great when I do use it and they've recently

06:51.400 --> 06:53.280
done really good integration with GOG.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.280
Oh yeah.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.840
Lutris describes itself as an open source gaming platform that makes gaming on Linux

06:57.840 --> 07:02.240
easier, but basically manage installing and providing optimal settings for games, which

07:02.240 --> 07:04.000
is probably why you like it so much.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Yeah.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Yeah.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.520
And they've just, version 0.52 adds the Vulkan ICD, which is the installable client driver,

07:11.520 --> 07:15.820
into the system options and adds a sample count option for wine to enable certain types

07:15.820 --> 07:22.480
of anti-aliasing, and there's now like better detection about an improper wine setup, wine

07:22.480 --> 07:23.480
and Vulkan setup.

07:23.480 --> 07:24.480
Like if you have a bad combo.

07:24.480 --> 07:27.520
See, that's nice because that's already making me a little scared to go troubleshoot.

07:27.520 --> 07:28.520
That sounds complicated.

07:28.520 --> 07:31.520
And if you just want to play a game, that's the last thing you want.

07:31.520 --> 07:35.720
And you know, not too long ago they relaunched, or not relaunched, but they just updated their

07:35.720 --> 07:37.960
UI to GTK3, like in the 0.5 release.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.440
See, that is slow and steady.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.960
I mean, we needed that to happen.

07:40.960 --> 07:41.960
So that's great.

07:41.960 --> 07:44.360
Now, two really great projects out there, two really great projects out there.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.920
So check out Lutris if you haven't before.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.740
It's a great way to bring in a lot of different game stores, including Steam.

07:48.740 --> 07:51.880
You can install the Steam runtime stuff and all of that too.

07:51.880 --> 07:57.000
We have a couple of topic experts for our next story in the community news.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.560
I wanted to put this in here because I think, and you guys correct me if I'm wrong, I believe

08:02.560 --> 08:07.860
I sort of watched the beginning of this process, which was now a very long time ago when I

08:07.860 --> 08:13.880
attended a canonical Snap Sprint, and it was either the first or the second one I attended,

08:13.880 --> 08:17.560
and Microsoft was there talking about snapping up VS Code.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.520
And that might have been almost two years ago now?

08:19.520 --> 08:20.520
Yeah.

08:20.520 --> 08:25.360
So you were at two sprints, and those were both attended by Visual Studio Code, one in

08:25.360 --> 08:33.360
September of 2017, and then the following one in January of 2018.

08:33.360 --> 08:36.100
And we'd started talking to them in May of 2017.

08:36.100 --> 08:43.640
So that's how long it takes to work with an ISV and bring, you know, their already existing

08:43.640 --> 08:48.680
Linux software to, you know, an app store type system.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.160
I just want everybody to soak that in for a second.

08:51.160 --> 08:55.800
Like, so the end result is an announcement, hey, VS Code is available as a snap now.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.800
And you're like, oh, sure.

08:57.800 --> 08:58.800
Great.

08:58.800 --> 09:02.880
Years, literally years of working with Microsoft to get this.

09:02.880 --> 09:06.240
It's funny too, because almost my first reaction was like, oh, it wasn't there, there wasn't

09:06.240 --> 09:07.240
one already?

09:07.240 --> 09:08.240
Yeah.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.240
Yeah.

09:09.240 --> 09:10.240
So this is the thing, right?

09:10.240 --> 09:14.400
And I was the maintainer of it.

09:14.400 --> 09:20.000
So yeah, we did that work in order to sort of, you know, test the system out in the very

09:20.000 --> 09:21.560
early days.

09:21.560 --> 09:28.840
But then it's not enough just to say, oh, here's a snap of a Visual Studio Code.

09:28.840 --> 09:32.180
Because you know, it's available via other means.

09:32.180 --> 09:36.120
What's interesting with the snap of Visual Studio Code is that if you're using VS Code

09:36.120 --> 09:40.840
on Windows and Mac, the updates appear in app, it tells you there's a new update and

09:40.840 --> 09:43.480
that you should restart now and all of those sorts of things.

09:43.480 --> 09:45.960
It's all very slickly integrated.

09:45.960 --> 09:50.300
And one of the reasons why this was protracted is that Microsoft have embedded that same

09:50.300 --> 09:56.920
capability in the snap of Visual Studio Code to bring it in feature parity with the versions

09:56.920 --> 09:58.680
that you use on Windows and Mac.

09:58.680 --> 10:03.120
And I think that's something we're going to start to see a little bit more of as we go

10:03.120 --> 10:04.120
forwards now.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.120
Yeah.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.040
And I think it's important that you're talking about this, I think, because that's a tiny

10:08.040 --> 10:09.040
little thing.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.720
It sounds like a small feature, but it's one of those things in the product that makes

10:11.720 --> 10:14.840
it feel like a robust editor that you're going to depend on.

10:14.840 --> 10:17.520
And developers coming from Mac OS or Windows expect it.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.520
Exactly.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.520
Yeah.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.240
And you know, one of the other things that's come out of this exercise is obviously Visual

10:22.240 --> 10:28.680
Studio Code has a lot of users, Ubuntu has a lot of users, and Microsoft have been publishing

10:28.680 --> 10:35.040
code insiders in store for about eight months now.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.080
And lots of people are using that.

10:37.080 --> 10:45.120
And that was really helpful for us and Microsoft to identify some teething troubles.

10:45.120 --> 10:49.380
One of the things you will see cited around the internet, if you look in the right places,

10:49.380 --> 10:52.560
is that snaps are slow to start.

10:52.560 --> 10:55.680
And certainly, we experienced that.

10:55.680 --> 10:59.880
And code was one of the applications that had this problem.

10:59.880 --> 11:05.600
So we dug into that with them and we fixed this in the back end of last year.

11:05.600 --> 11:11.840
And all of those fixes landed in sort of early January after the Christmas break.

11:11.840 --> 11:19.360
But we've recently written a blog post about how we profiled all of that stuff and used

11:19.360 --> 11:25.360
Visual Studio Code across a number of different distributions to understand what the impact

11:25.360 --> 11:28.720
was and what was actually causing this problem.

11:28.720 --> 11:34.560
And consequently, snaps are faster, not just for code, but for a whole raft of applications

11:34.560 --> 11:35.560
now.

11:35.560 --> 11:39.120
And through doing that work, we've got some ideas in the future about how we can improve

11:39.120 --> 11:40.760
the performance further still.

11:40.760 --> 11:45.720
So it's been a very worthwhile process all the way through, really.

11:45.720 --> 11:46.720
Yeah.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.680
Everybody appreciates faster application startup time.

11:49.680 --> 11:52.680
So that's going to benefit a lot of users.

11:52.680 --> 11:58.520
And congratulations to you guys for sticking with it and working with Microsoft, because

11:58.520 --> 11:59.840
that is the process.

11:59.840 --> 12:03.600
That is what it is like to work with large corporations.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.400
And it's totally normal.

12:05.400 --> 12:09.880
And so part of the behind the curtain stuff that we don't see is the work that goes down,

12:09.880 --> 12:12.720
the in-person meetings, the emails, the months and months of communicating.

12:12.720 --> 12:16.720
That boring sort of just following up, nothing exciting but checking in, how's it going?

12:16.720 --> 12:23.240
And something that is totally you will never see, but when organizations work together,

12:23.240 --> 12:27.040
there's legal process you have to go through.

12:27.040 --> 12:30.800
When you've got something in a store, and it's a trademarked thing, and there are logos

12:30.800 --> 12:35.280
and icons and all of that, that all needs to be squared away with legal people on both

12:35.280 --> 12:36.280
sides of the fence.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.040
And there's months of work involved in just getting that right.

12:39.040 --> 12:45.080
It's really easy to take a deb of something from some random place that it's been published,

12:45.080 --> 12:48.240
and then repackage it up and stick it in the AUR, for example.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.720
I did that back in the past when I was involved in the arch community.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.860
It was a real simple thing to do.

12:53.860 --> 12:58.800
But when you're doing it as two organizations working together, there's a whole additional

12:58.800 --> 13:01.320
bit of process you have to go through to do it legitimately.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.320
I would imagine.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.880
I would imagine that's putting it lightly.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.360
Well, that's super cool.

13:07.360 --> 13:14.700
And I think we have a couple of boots on the code right here that have loaded it up and

13:14.700 --> 13:15.700
tried it.

13:15.700 --> 13:18.800
I believe, Mr. Cheese, you've become a VS Code user, correct?

13:18.800 --> 13:21.280
Yes, I have.

13:21.280 --> 13:26.200
Actually just kind of trying the editors, I haven't done a lot of editing recently or

13:26.200 --> 13:27.880
coding recently.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.800
So it started with Sublime.

13:30.800 --> 13:37.240
And then what killed me was whenever I tried to command S and save a file, and they prompted

13:37.240 --> 13:38.240
me to pay them.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.240
Yeah.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.240
Yeah, that is annoying.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.680
Well, immediately I was like, I got to find something else.

13:42.680 --> 13:48.660
Then I found VS Code, pulled it from Microsoft, originally for the Mac, and then reloaded

13:48.660 --> 13:53.840
a Mac with Linux this weekend, and then pulled the snap down and installed it that way.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.680
Super quick, super simple.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.020
Just worked right out of the box, man, it's so good.

13:58.020 --> 13:59.020
So nice.

13:59.020 --> 14:00.020
Huh.

14:00.020 --> 14:01.020
Okay.

14:01.020 --> 14:02.020
Stay a while and listen.

14:02.020 --> 14:04.760
Elle, I'm curious about your experience because I think you said in our group chat too that

14:04.760 --> 14:07.080
you've recently switched over to VS Code.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.360
Are you using the snap?

14:08.360 --> 14:10.520
And why did you go with a Microsoft editor?

14:10.520 --> 14:13.440
So I must admit that I'm not as fancy as Cheese.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.960
I come from using Vim.

14:15.960 --> 14:18.640
So I was doing it old school.

14:18.640 --> 14:24.180
And somebody turned me on to VS Code, telling me that it was actually integrated with Git.

14:24.180 --> 14:28.280
So when I was doing things like pushing up my notes, I could just write it in Markdown.

14:28.280 --> 14:32.640
There was something there already that told me if my Markdown wasn't compatible with what

14:32.640 --> 14:36.780
was needed for GitHub, and then I could just push it when I was done.

14:36.780 --> 14:38.960
So it just made my workflow a lot simpler.

14:38.960 --> 14:42.120
Yeah, that does sound really handy.

14:42.120 --> 14:49.260
You could do a whole episode on top quality extensions for Visual Studio Code that streamline

14:49.260 --> 14:51.520
your workflow or supercharge things.

14:51.520 --> 14:56.520
But one of the things it did this week, which I just loved, is I was working on some system

14:56.520 --> 14:57.520
dunit files.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.240
And I opened them up.

14:59.240 --> 15:03.760
And then down in the bottom, it said, hey, there are extensions in the marketplace that

15:03.760 --> 15:08.100
know what a service extension means.

15:08.100 --> 15:09.100
Do you want to look at them?

15:09.100 --> 15:10.860
I went, okay, then.

15:10.860 --> 15:13.640
And then there was a bunch of tools for system dunit.

15:13.640 --> 15:17.280
And I looked at a couple of them, I thought that one sounds good, install.

15:17.280 --> 15:24.040
And then suddenly, I've got tooltips, expansions, and assistance around system dunit.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.120
So it's like, oh, my goodness, this is brilliant.

15:26.120 --> 15:31.640
So now as I open up random language files, because I'm doing some stuff with languages

15:31.640 --> 15:35.680
at the moment, languages that I wouldn't ordinarily use, it says, oh, hey, I've noticed you've

15:35.680 --> 15:36.680
opened something in Erlang.

15:36.680 --> 15:38.480
Would you like to look at the Erlang extension?

15:38.480 --> 15:41.680
You say, yes, please, and then you install some things.

15:41.680 --> 15:46.040
And suddenly, you know, this language that doesn't mean much to you is now decorated

15:46.040 --> 15:48.600
with all sorts of useful hints and advice.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.600
It's brilliant.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.600
Very easy.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.600
Yeah, much easier to make it readable.

15:51.600 --> 15:52.600
Erlang, eh?

15:52.600 --> 15:56.160
What are you doing with Erlang?

15:56.160 --> 15:57.160
It's a long story.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.160
I thought it might be.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.160
You don't need to hear it.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.200
Oh, I don't know about that.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.360
That was just one example.

16:02.360 --> 16:06.100
Well, we have another SnapGraph summit as we're on the topic.

16:06.100 --> 16:10.520
We have another SnapGraph summit coming up in June.

16:10.520 --> 16:13.600
This one's going to be in Montreal in Canada.

16:13.600 --> 16:18.480
And we're partnering with, we're co-hosting the event with Travis CI.

16:18.480 --> 16:22.240
So this time around, there's a focus on language ecosystems.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.240
So we're doing lots of work with languages at the moment.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.240
Oh, neat.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.840
I'm sure some interesting developments will come.

16:26.840 --> 16:27.840
That does sound cool.

16:27.840 --> 16:28.880
Well, stick around.

16:28.880 --> 16:29.880
We have more to talk about.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.560
I wanted to give a quick update.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.360
There is a distribution that's kind of unique that we, I don't even know if it's fair to

16:34.360 --> 16:35.800
call it a distribution.

16:35.800 --> 16:39.320
We've talked about it before on this show and on Linux Action News.

16:39.320 --> 16:41.640
It was formerly known as WLinux.

16:41.640 --> 16:48.400
And it was Linux in the Microsoft Store that was optimized for the Windows subsystem for

16:48.400 --> 16:49.400
Linux.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.400
Right.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.760
To give you the best Linux experience on Windows.

16:51.760 --> 16:56.940
And to their credit, they've actually been contributing bugs, bug fixes upstream.

16:56.940 --> 17:01.240
They recently collaborated with the Berkeley DB team at Oracle and the WSL team at Microsoft

17:01.240 --> 17:05.560
to solve a bug that was nagging WSL performance.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.640
That's pretty great.

17:06.640 --> 17:10.200
They say they detected a bug in Fedora packaging tools and reported it upstream in time for

17:10.200 --> 17:12.020
Fedora 30.

17:12.020 --> 17:13.440
So they're doing stuff.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.200
And that's just top of the iceberg, whatever it is.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.200
That is pretty neat.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.200
Yeah.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.480
And regardless of whether you want to pay for an operating, whatever you want to call

17:21.480 --> 17:25.840
this distribution set of software tools to run on your proprietary operating system or

17:25.840 --> 17:29.800
not, it's neat to show that they're stress testing the stuff.

17:29.800 --> 17:30.800
They're working.

17:30.800 --> 17:31.800
They're putting in work.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.920
So if you want to run some other operating system, there's going to be upstream benefits.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.040
And it shows that there's clearly interest on both sides.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.800
They're getting some good support from Microsoft.

17:38.800 --> 17:42.860
So people who want to run more Linux on Windows, you're in luck.

17:42.860 --> 17:43.860
So there's a big change coming.

17:43.860 --> 17:44.860
You ready?

17:44.860 --> 17:45.860
Oh.

17:45.860 --> 17:46.860
They're changing their name from WL Linux.

17:46.860 --> 17:47.860
Oh, what?

17:47.860 --> 17:48.860
OK.

17:48.860 --> 17:49.860
OK.

17:49.860 --> 17:53.880
And I'm getting this wrong because it's based on a Japanese pronunciation that is probably

17:53.880 --> 17:55.260
pronounced Pengin.

17:55.260 --> 17:57.480
But so I think that's how you pronounce it is Pengin.

17:57.480 --> 18:01.400
It's going to be P-E-N-G-W-I-N.

18:01.400 --> 18:02.960
So not Penguin.

18:02.960 --> 18:03.960
But Penguin.

18:03.960 --> 18:06.280
So that's based on Japanese pronunciation.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.200
But you got the win in there, which is kind of a hint.

18:08.200 --> 18:11.600
And Hayden Barnes was interviewed by The Register.

18:11.600 --> 18:15.040
And he said that, well, you know, come on, WLinux was only supposed to be the code name.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.400
It wasn't going to be like the main name or anything like that.

18:17.400 --> 18:22.480
It's also a massive misnomer as well, because the one thing it didn't have in it was Linux.

18:22.480 --> 18:23.480
All right.

18:23.480 --> 18:24.480
All right.

18:24.480 --> 18:25.480
OK.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.560
It's a distribution that's entirely absent of a Linux kernel.

18:28.560 --> 18:32.680
So I guess that's another good reason to rename it.

18:32.680 --> 18:35.440
That kind of invokes Cygwin in my mind.

18:35.440 --> 18:36.440
Yeah.

18:36.440 --> 18:37.440
Absolutely.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.440
And they spoke over here.

18:38.440 --> 18:39.440
And The Register did too.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.440
Isn't it pronounced Penguin?

18:40.440 --> 18:41.440
Well, I don't know here.

18:41.440 --> 18:47.400
It says he added it is close to the Japanese pronunciation and transliteration of Penguin,

18:47.400 --> 18:49.720
which is Pengin.

18:49.720 --> 18:55.840
In The Register, they spelled it as the pronunciation is P-E-N-G-I-N, you know, like gin, the drink.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.680
Sounds like the Texas pronunciation.

18:57.680 --> 18:58.680
It does.

18:58.680 --> 18:59.680
The old Penguin.

18:59.680 --> 19:03.000
Then you mix in Cygwin, and you get Penguin.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
I don't know.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Yeah.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Maybe.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
I could see it.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
Hopefully, you don't have to say it.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
You just have to install it.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Yeah.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
I don't.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.200
I've never actually tried it.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.600
So one of these days, I'll get around to it.

19:14.600 --> 19:15.600
Get around and install it.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.600
You never tried?

19:16.600 --> 19:17.600
Have you tried the subsystem?

19:17.600 --> 19:20.440
I think once, maybe, briefly.

19:20.440 --> 19:25.600
I guess this is just a testament to the limited amount of Windows in your life.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.920
I don't have a functioning Windows install anywhere.

19:27.920 --> 19:33.200
I do have a partition on my ThinkPad that if I wanted to go through the process of setting

19:33.200 --> 19:36.080
up Grub to boot it, I could actually probably boot it.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.080
So you're close.

19:37.080 --> 19:38.080
I think.

19:38.080 --> 19:41.720
But yeah, I haven't been in Windows in a very, very long time.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.840
It may have now been multiples of years.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.880
It's funny, we were just talking about this off air, that neither of us are in a position

19:46.880 --> 19:51.340
where we have a regular Windows install that we're using, even in a VM.

19:51.340 --> 19:54.200
There's actually enough open source stuff happening over in the Windows world.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.560
There's been stuff we wanted to try but could not.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.560
The downsides of an all Linux lifestyle.

19:58.560 --> 20:01.120
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

20:01.120 --> 20:02.120
That's true.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.120
That's true.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.120
All right.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.120
Well, there you go.

20:05.120 --> 20:09.280
If you have any experience with WL, well, now PENGIN, or maybe if you have any experience

20:09.280 --> 20:15.880
with how you pronounce it, let us know, linuxunplugged.com slash contact and send us in a note.

20:15.880 --> 20:16.880
Let us know.

20:16.880 --> 20:17.880
Please do.

20:17.880 --> 20:18.880
We need to go check in on that party.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.760
With that door closed, I can't really tell they're out there.

20:20.760 --> 20:21.760
Yeah, that's dangerous.

20:21.760 --> 20:25.480
So let's get to a little housekeeping first.

20:25.480 --> 20:31.500
First up on the housekeeping list this week, go check out Coder Radio 352.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.780
That's coder.show slash 352.

20:33.780 --> 20:42.520
If nothing else, Wes covered his super crazy, awesome, run out of RAM setup.

20:42.520 --> 20:48.080
He has an Ubuntu 1904 complete working environment where he's editing podcasts and everything,

20:48.080 --> 20:50.100
all running out of RAM.

20:50.100 --> 20:53.880
And he covered the entire setup in episode 352.

20:53.880 --> 20:54.880
You could do it right now.

20:54.880 --> 20:55.880
Absolutely.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.360
It's just using stuff built into Linux.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.760
Actually, I was running it this morning.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.560
I don't know why you're not in there all the time, dude.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.000
It runs as fast at the speed of RAM.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
It is pretty snappy.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.160
I would live in there.

21:06.160 --> 21:07.160
I would live in there.

21:07.160 --> 21:10.920
So that was a, I just, it really is a segment we could have done in this show.

21:10.920 --> 21:14.680
But you and I just were last minute filling in for Mike.

21:14.680 --> 21:20.500
And so we were just talking about whatever, just shooting the S and it came up.

21:20.500 --> 21:24.520
And so go listen to that episode because it really should be a segment in this show.

21:24.520 --> 21:25.520
Yeah.

21:25.520 --> 21:26.520
And go give it a try too.

21:26.520 --> 21:27.520
I'd be curious.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.520
I linked some docs.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.520
There's some pretty good documentation on how to do it.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.880
But I'd be curious to see if other people find it suitable on their systems.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.360
And there's also a really cool opportunity.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.920
We'll have a link in the show notes.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.780
It's generally like $1,000.

21:37.780 --> 21:44.320
But there is an opportunity for women and underrepresented groups from untapped pathways

21:44.320 --> 21:50.640
to go attend the up and coming 2019 Grace Hopper celebration, which is a big ticket

21:50.640 --> 21:51.640
item to get in there.

21:51.640 --> 21:55.400
So if you can get in for free, if you're in that group, click the note in our show notes.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.120
I think it'd be pretty awesome to be able to attend that.

21:57.120 --> 22:00.400
Yeah, there's lots of good people to meet there, lots of good networking, and I'm sure

22:00.400 --> 22:02.320
all kinds of stuff to see.

22:02.320 --> 22:06.800
Grace Hopper was an amazing, I think she's passed, yeah?

22:06.800 --> 22:08.520
Grace Hopper was an amazing woman.

22:08.520 --> 22:10.880
Some really cool YouTube videos out there.

22:10.880 --> 22:12.280
Some really cool YouTube videos.

22:12.280 --> 22:13.820
Go look that up after the show.

22:13.820 --> 22:16.080
And then last but not least, we're going through the housekeeping quick.

22:16.080 --> 22:19.280
So we got to go check in on that party before they burn the studio down.

22:19.280 --> 22:25.360
Last but not least, Linux Academy is hiring for a full stack Ruby on Rails developer position.

22:25.360 --> 22:28.560
Full time, remote, with benefits, everything.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.900
And they're looking to fill, I think a couple of them.

22:30.900 --> 22:33.840
So if that might be you and you're looking for a change, link in the show notes.

22:33.840 --> 22:37.040
Or go to linuxacademy.com slash careers to find your way there.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.640
That could be a great opportunity.

22:38.640 --> 22:43.160
And that, my friends, boom, is the housekeeping.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.440
So we have so much to get into today.

22:45.440 --> 22:46.440
So Cheese, why don't you come over here?

22:46.440 --> 22:47.440
Let's go outside.

22:47.440 --> 22:48.440
Open up the soundproof door there.

22:48.440 --> 22:49.440
There we go.

22:49.440 --> 22:50.440
Hey, everybody.

22:50.440 --> 22:51.840
What up?

22:51.840 --> 22:56.960
So this week, we are super excited to announce that the new Jupyter broadcasting logos have

22:56.960 --> 22:58.280
rolled out.

22:58.280 --> 23:02.480
The new Linux unplugged logo, all of the shows, the new look on the website.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.320
And we want to just take a minute here.

23:04.320 --> 23:05.320
Hold on.

23:05.320 --> 23:06.320
You know what?

23:06.320 --> 23:07.320
I can't.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.320
This is so loud.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.320
I can't focus with that door open.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.320
Hold on.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.320
I got to get rid of these people, OK?

23:11.320 --> 23:12.320
You guys don't mind, right?

23:12.320 --> 23:13.320
No, no.

23:13.320 --> 23:14.320
The show comes first, right?

23:14.320 --> 23:15.320
It doesn't.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.320
Hey, guys.

23:16.320 --> 23:17.320
Hey, guys.

23:17.320 --> 23:18.320
Hey, tone it down.

23:18.320 --> 23:19.320
Hey, you guys.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.320
That's it.

23:20.320 --> 23:21.320
That's it.

23:21.320 --> 23:22.320
There we go.

23:22.320 --> 23:23.320
Wow.

23:23.320 --> 23:38.440
I forgot to tell you, I have to leave right after the show.

23:38.440 --> 23:39.820
I can't help clean up.

23:39.820 --> 23:44.320
So Wes, about that sous vide meat, are you sure?

23:44.320 --> 23:45.320
That's better, right?

23:45.320 --> 23:46.320
Sound quality is better now.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.320
Way better.

23:47.320 --> 23:50.320
Now, yeah, really, really super excited about this.

23:50.320 --> 23:55.320
And I thought we'd talk a little bit about the sort of our intention behind it.

23:55.320 --> 23:56.320
We won't take too long.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.320
But people have had questions.

23:57.320 --> 24:01.320
I think let's start with what's going to be the most controversial bit of art.

24:01.320 --> 24:02.320
And then we'll go down from there.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.320
And we'll talk about stuff.

24:03.320 --> 24:08.760
So this has really been a group effort that started back in October with the Linux Academy

24:08.760 --> 24:12.360
core design team, who came up with all of the original concepts.

24:12.360 --> 24:13.360
Really good stuff.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.360
They worked with us.

24:14.360 --> 24:15.360
You know, we were going for clean, readable.

24:15.360 --> 24:19.520
And we were trying to think about like the next 10 years.

24:19.520 --> 24:23.280
And then about a month ago, Cheese came on the team and really took it over the finish

24:23.280 --> 24:24.280
line.

24:24.280 --> 24:28.680
Like last Friday, we were on a group call for eight hours with Wes and Cheese and Angela.

24:28.680 --> 24:31.840
And like each one of us, like Angela's like uploading something to the website.

24:31.840 --> 24:37.520
Wes is tweaking some CSS while Cheese is banging out a new logo and disabling old WordPress

24:37.520 --> 24:38.520
plugins.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.520
It was a massively parallel operation.

24:39.520 --> 24:40.520
It was really.

24:40.520 --> 24:41.640
It was very impressive.

24:41.640 --> 24:48.980
And so now we have the new artwork out and the reaction has been pretty positive.

24:48.980 --> 24:51.680
Some people don't like the new cloud logo for the network.

24:51.680 --> 24:52.960
So that's the one I want to talk about first.

24:52.960 --> 24:54.960
I want to talk about the reason we did that.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.360
I was it was my choice.

24:56.360 --> 25:01.200
I was all of all of the art was directed and led by us.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.000
And we wanted to go everything clean, readable and modern.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.080
And I was thinking about the next 10 years and I was thinking about what is going to

25:07.080 --> 25:11.760
be mainstream Linux and open source use in the next 10 years.

25:11.760 --> 25:19.600
And I mean, besides maybe mobile in like Android or something, it's going to be the cloud.

25:19.600 --> 25:23.480
The cloud is made of Linux and free software, and I think we need to remember that.

25:23.480 --> 25:29.520
We need to be reminded that this nebulous term is really just made up of different free

25:29.520 --> 25:33.440
software and open source projects that are interconnected together in a way that provides

25:33.440 --> 25:35.160
a service.

25:35.160 --> 25:42.640
And I kind of felt like that was the future face in a way for mainstream users of Linux

25:42.640 --> 25:44.300
and free software and open source.

25:44.300 --> 25:48.580
And so I wanted our logo to sort of represent that a little bit.

25:48.580 --> 25:50.560
And so that was the basis behind it.

25:50.560 --> 25:54.240
But you want to talk a little bit about some of the show logos and some of the ideas there

25:54.240 --> 25:57.400
and the we got the badge for people to recognize it.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.400
Take a minute.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.400
Talk about that stuff.

25:59.400 --> 26:00.400
It's pretty awesome work.

26:00.400 --> 26:01.400
So, yeah.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.980
So, I mean, we went through we went through all of the logos.

26:03.980 --> 26:11.160
First off, like Chris said, they worked with Linux Academy, and I'd like to give a big

26:11.160 --> 26:18.800
thank you to those the Linux Academy art department, Ingrid and Alexander and, and since lean and

26:18.800 --> 26:22.360
Joelle and everybody over there, they've been great.

26:22.360 --> 26:27.420
And essentially, they, they, you know, gave me all the logos in a zip file.

26:27.420 --> 26:32.320
We went through them and kind of looked at them and did some tweaking and modifying,

26:32.320 --> 26:37.760
you know, to, to, to as best we could incorporate some, some new themes.

26:37.760 --> 26:43.620
So you'll see the cloud, like Chris said, and that'll kind of going forward as we as

26:43.620 --> 26:48.240
new shows are developed, you'll see that more and more.

26:48.240 --> 26:52.240
And of course, we couldn't get Joe to change the user logo so that that one user is going

26:52.240 --> 26:56.320
to user is going to stay the same one stays pretty close to the original to Yeah, that's

26:56.320 --> 26:57.320
true.

26:57.320 --> 27:00.880
Yeah, like some of them are just like modifications of the original logo, just bring them up to

27:00.880 --> 27:03.320
date a little bit with new inspirations in there.

27:03.320 --> 27:04.320
Absolutely.

27:04.320 --> 27:09.000
I mean, like the rocket and the cloud in the Linux unplug logo had been, you know, recreated

27:09.000 --> 27:16.040
that and you'll see that rocket in that cloud being used going forward in a lot of our designs.

27:16.040 --> 27:22.000
The color palettes, again, were kind of based on we wanted to differentiate all the shows

27:22.000 --> 27:29.340
the best we could but still kind of tie everything back so that whenever you saw it, you wouldn't,

27:29.340 --> 27:31.880
you wouldn't think that it's not a Jupiter show.

27:31.880 --> 27:35.480
Yeah, if you if you like Linux unplugged, you will you'll recognize user now, right?

27:35.480 --> 27:37.840
If you like user area, you'll recognize the code of radio.

27:37.840 --> 27:38.840
We didn't have that at all.

27:38.840 --> 27:42.920
We didn't have any consistency across the shows in the brand just was just didn't have

27:42.920 --> 27:43.920
the resources.

27:43.920 --> 27:50.260
You know, I told Chris that I'll take the heat on the color on tech snap.

27:50.260 --> 27:53.920
You know, the magenta, it's not pink.

27:53.920 --> 27:58.000
I'm sure I would I would I would hope that Emma likes it.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.640
Oh, yeah.

27:59.640 --> 28:00.640
But I like it, Emma.

28:00.640 --> 28:01.640
She's a big pink pan fan.

28:01.640 --> 28:06.560
But it was one of those things where, you know, guys, look, I realize red and black

28:06.560 --> 28:09.440
is such a cool color combination.

28:09.440 --> 28:14.340
But we also have to kind of differentiate that a little bit and bring in some other

28:14.340 --> 28:18.720
colors and be able to work work with a wider palette of colors.

28:18.720 --> 28:20.920
So you'll see that to going forward.

28:20.920 --> 28:27.480
You'll also notice that on a lot of our graphics that we have a badge in the top left corner.

28:27.480 --> 28:31.360
And that badge is just simply there to remind you without putting Jupiter Broadcasting on

28:31.360 --> 28:32.360
on every single thing.

28:32.360 --> 28:36.040
That little badge is there to remind you, you know, what show you're watching.

28:36.040 --> 28:40.680
Those colors have been, you know, coordinated with the colors in the logos to match the

28:40.680 --> 28:41.880
corners.

28:41.880 --> 28:47.760
You'll see that across YouTube, the cast of Plasta that we actually push the shows out

28:47.760 --> 28:49.000
with everywhere.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.760
You'll see that kind of theme commonly used.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.960
I think this really gives us a nice clean slate.

28:55.960 --> 28:59.120
I know that I had worked with a lot of the J.B. logos before.

28:59.120 --> 29:02.600
That's what's kind of awesome about this, actually, is really I mean, for nearly a decade,

29:02.600 --> 29:04.880
you've been on and off in the circle creating artwork for us.

29:04.880 --> 29:08.600
So it's it's kind of amazing that the first time we did like a one uniform roll out of

29:08.600 --> 29:12.320
a whole new look, you were you were here to push us over the finish line like it's kind

29:12.320 --> 29:13.320
of perfect.

29:13.320 --> 29:14.320
Yeah.

29:14.320 --> 29:18.400
And, you know, I think the timing was just was just perfect.

29:18.400 --> 29:21.720
I do wish I had a little more time to spend with them and not that I think that there's

29:21.720 --> 29:23.720
anything I would change right off the bat.

29:23.720 --> 29:30.080
But you know, when you're developing stuff like that, the more time you get, the better.

29:30.080 --> 29:33.240
But then I guess it can also be to detriment and kind of slow you down.

29:33.240 --> 29:34.640
But it was a mad dash.

29:34.640 --> 29:38.960
Well, I know that, you know, if we were to just talk about the color combinations and

29:38.960 --> 29:43.260
maybe one day I'll show be able to show some of this other work to you guys.

29:43.260 --> 29:50.840
But just the color combinations that went into Coder in an attempt to, you know, resemble

29:50.840 --> 29:56.440
an editor and code highlights, if you're not a fan of the magenta, I guarantee there's

29:56.440 --> 30:01.180
some of those designs for Coder that you would absolutely not love.

30:01.180 --> 30:05.500
But if you love Miamis in the 90s, you would you would absolutely love them.

30:05.500 --> 30:09.420
So there's just a ton of different changes that we made when it when it comes to that

30:09.420 --> 30:15.400
and different color combinations and different ideas and and how do we make snap, snap?

30:15.400 --> 30:17.920
How do you visually show that?

30:17.920 --> 30:21.600
So there's a lot of thought that went into into the logos.

30:21.600 --> 30:22.600
Absolutely.

30:22.600 --> 30:25.280
You've got to tell the people about I mean, we've got a lot of good feedback.

30:25.280 --> 30:30.240
We've gotten, of course, some strong negative feedback, but we got we got probably the most

30:30.240 --> 30:32.840
amazing feedback this morning on Telegram.

30:32.840 --> 30:33.840
You tell people about that.

30:33.840 --> 30:34.840
Yeah.

30:34.840 --> 30:40.680
So so we got some feedback this morning from and I probably am going to butcher his name.

30:40.680 --> 30:41.680
Kyrian.

30:41.680 --> 30:44.240
I believe it's his name.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.240
And he wrote in me.

30:45.240 --> 30:46.240
I know.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.240
Right.

30:47.240 --> 30:52.440
And he wrote in to tell us that he's he's it's he's hard sided, so he doesn't have very

30:52.440 --> 30:53.440
good vision.

30:53.440 --> 30:57.120
And he struggled with the old logos and being able to determine and differentiate the logos

30:57.120 --> 30:58.600
and the shows.

30:58.600 --> 31:05.240
But now with the new logos and the very minimalist look of the new logos, he's able to actually

31:05.240 --> 31:06.240
see these better.

31:06.240 --> 31:11.840
And to me, that man, that is the best feedback I've gotten out of this whole turnaround with

31:11.840 --> 31:21.200
these logos and with this rebranding to where someone actually gets is makes it more accessible

31:21.200 --> 31:22.200
for them.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.840
He's seen the logo for the first time, essentially.

31:23.840 --> 31:24.840
Yeah.

31:24.840 --> 31:25.840
And that's great, dude.

31:25.840 --> 31:31.080
I mean, it literally made whenever I saw that comment, it made the the the hairs on my arms

31:31.080 --> 31:32.920
stand up just reading it.

31:32.920 --> 31:34.720
And it kind of speaks to the purpose to write.

31:34.720 --> 31:35.720
We want to connect people.

31:35.720 --> 31:39.080
I mean, the logos are good on themselves, but the whole point is to to bring you to

31:39.080 --> 31:41.400
the content and get to listen to us.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.400
Yeah.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.400
And swag.

31:43.400 --> 31:49.000
So, ladies and gentlemen, Westpain has the first round of stickers that we will have

31:49.000 --> 31:50.480
at MinixFest Northwest.

31:50.480 --> 31:52.480
I really hope you're playing the bongos.

31:52.480 --> 31:53.920
I am.

31:53.920 --> 31:54.920
Go for it.

31:54.920 --> 31:56.200
West is opening the sticker box right now.

31:56.200 --> 32:00.400
This is our first reveal of the new logos as stickers.

32:00.400 --> 32:04.280
Oh, how do they look?

32:04.280 --> 32:06.520
User error first out of the box.

32:06.520 --> 32:07.800
User error coming out sharp.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.560
The new user error sticker looks really good.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.600
Now we've got a code radio.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.320
Oh, man.

32:13.320 --> 32:14.320
Nailed it.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.320
Cheese.

32:15.320 --> 32:16.320
I will take.

32:16.320 --> 32:17.320
Don't worry.

32:17.320 --> 32:18.320
We'll take pictures and send them to you.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.320
Nailed the code radio.

32:19.320 --> 32:21.600
Well, of course we needed Linux Unplugged.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.200
The blues are perfect.

32:23.200 --> 32:24.200
They're popping.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.080
Oh, it's these.

32:26.080 --> 32:27.800
Every one of these is nailing it so far.

32:27.800 --> 32:28.800
This is so great.

32:28.800 --> 32:29.800
OK.

32:29.800 --> 32:30.800
OK.

32:30.800 --> 32:31.800
Look at that.

32:31.800 --> 32:32.800
Look at that.

32:32.800 --> 32:33.800
That looks great.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.360
And those BSD brethren.

32:35.360 --> 32:36.800
And that's fun.

32:36.800 --> 32:38.880
That is this is the BSD one looks even.

32:38.880 --> 32:40.400
Even the BSD one.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.680
Even the BSD one looks good.

32:42.680 --> 32:43.680
Wow.

32:43.680 --> 32:46.040
And perhaps the piece of resistance.

32:46.040 --> 32:47.040
Linux Action News.

32:47.040 --> 32:48.040
I love the cutout.

32:48.040 --> 32:49.040
It's really nice.

32:49.040 --> 32:50.040
That's die cut and fancy.

32:50.040 --> 32:54.240
That die cut following the red box is slick.

32:54.240 --> 32:55.240
And the network.

32:55.240 --> 32:58.920
The network logo, which is a circular badge style sticker.

32:58.920 --> 33:01.040
Man, these are top notch.

33:01.040 --> 33:02.160
These are top.

33:02.160 --> 33:03.160
These are our best stickers.

33:03.160 --> 33:06.800
I mean, these logos were sort of designed around the idea of being able to do this.

33:06.800 --> 33:10.840
But that is we'll be giving these away starting at Linux Fest Northwest and then down the

33:10.840 --> 33:16.040
road we'll make them available to the community via various means, including the Linux Academy

33:16.040 --> 33:17.400
gem store and other places.

33:17.400 --> 33:18.460
So stay tuned.

33:18.460 --> 33:19.460
That's all coming down the road.

33:19.460 --> 33:23.380
But for now, at least initially, these stickers are only going to be available at Linux Fest

33:23.380 --> 33:26.020
Northwest because we've just ordered a small batch.

33:26.020 --> 33:28.620
And this is the first time I'm seeing these new logos.

33:28.620 --> 33:32.720
This is for me is I'm disappointed that I haven't saved enough space on the back of

33:32.720 --> 33:33.720
the thing.

33:33.720 --> 33:34.720
I know.

33:34.720 --> 33:35.720
I know.

33:35.720 --> 33:36.720
We've got a sticker over it.

33:36.720 --> 33:38.040
This is an emotional moment.

33:38.040 --> 33:42.020
And I haven't had a chance to talk to Angela, but I bet for her, too.

33:42.020 --> 33:47.680
This is just something we never had the scope to pull off where, you know, you could have

33:47.680 --> 33:52.060
a designer sit with you on the phone for eight hours and crank out the different stuff as

33:52.060 --> 33:54.320
you upload a Twitter badge and it looks like crap.

33:54.320 --> 33:57.000
So you want a different version or you upload something to WordPress and it's too big.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.760
So you need a different export and just sit there and bang all that stuff out like it

34:00.760 --> 34:02.480
just wasn't something that was on our grasp before.

34:02.480 --> 34:05.360
And so that's one of the great things about being part of the Linux Academy team is that

34:05.360 --> 34:09.400
we have a little more reach now and we've been able to put together a pretty great team.

34:09.400 --> 34:10.400
And so it's great to have you.

34:10.400 --> 34:11.400
Cheese.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.400
Great work.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.400
Thanks, man.

34:13.400 --> 34:14.400
And boy, these can't wait to send you pictures.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.400
I'm super good.

34:15.400 --> 34:16.400
Good.

34:16.400 --> 34:17.400
That looks so good.

34:17.400 --> 34:18.400
Another another round of applause, guys.

34:18.400 --> 34:19.400
Come on.

34:19.400 --> 34:20.400
Those of you left the other round.

34:20.400 --> 34:21.400
Yeah.

34:21.400 --> 34:22.400
Thank you.

34:22.400 --> 34:23.400
Really, really well done.

34:23.400 --> 34:24.400
Man, that's great.

34:24.400 --> 34:25.400
You know what?

34:25.400 --> 34:26.400
We got to do another one of these two.

34:26.400 --> 34:29.200
We got to do a little man.

34:29.200 --> 34:30.620
We did it in one day.

34:30.620 --> 34:32.280
We rolled out all the new art.

34:32.280 --> 34:33.900
It feels good.

34:33.900 --> 34:37.160
It took us like six months to roll out the new TexNap logo.

34:37.160 --> 34:38.160
It was atrocious.

34:38.160 --> 34:39.160
Why?

34:39.160 --> 34:40.160
Yeah.

34:40.160 --> 34:41.160
OK.

34:41.160 --> 34:47.640
So there is an article out that proclaims that the Linux desktop is in trouble and uses

34:47.640 --> 34:53.320
recent statements by Linus and recent statements by Clem from Linux Mint and kind of comes

34:53.320 --> 34:57.980
together on a theory that Linux desktop is in decline.

34:57.980 --> 35:00.960
So I'll start with Linus's comments and then we'll start talking about this.

35:00.960 --> 35:01.960
We'll discuss it.

35:01.960 --> 35:07.400
SJVN writes on ZDNet, even Linus Torvalds is tired of the fragmentation in the Linux

35:07.400 --> 35:08.400
desktop.

35:08.400 --> 35:12.680
In a recent interview, Torvalds said the Chromebooks and Android are a path towards the desktop.

35:12.680 --> 35:13.680
Now why?

35:13.680 --> 35:17.200
He implies this because we don't have any standardized Linux desktop.

35:17.200 --> 35:23.100
Torvalds wishes we were better at having a standardized desktop that goes across distributions.

35:23.100 --> 35:24.800
You know, like Plasma and all.

35:24.800 --> 35:28.960
Torvalds thinks there's been some progress for software installation, but at the same

35:28.960 --> 35:33.800
time he is disappointed in the rivalry between Red Hat, which supports Flatpak, and Canonical,

35:33.800 --> 35:35.120
which supports Snaps.

35:35.120 --> 35:36.120
It bugs Torvalds.

35:36.120 --> 35:41.080
He's annoyed how the fragmentation of different vendors has held the desktop back so far.

35:41.080 --> 35:43.880
But he's not the only one that's grumpy right now.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.880
Clem from Mint is a little grumpy as well.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.080
He's been having some issues.

35:47.080 --> 35:51.040
Clem writes, it's not always easy to achieve what we want.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.480
Sometimes it's not even easy to define what we want to achieve.

35:53.480 --> 35:58.280
We can have doubts, we can work really hard on something for a while and then question

35:58.280 --> 36:01.840
it so much, we're not even sure we'll ship it.

36:01.840 --> 36:06.840
We can get demotivated, uncertain, depressed, even by negative reactions or just normal

36:06.840 --> 36:07.840
interactions.

36:07.840 --> 36:13.480
And it can lead to developers stepping away from the project, taking a break or even leaving

36:13.480 --> 36:14.480
for good.

36:14.480 --> 36:19.520
Yeah, I believe one of their main mutter, or no, it's muffin, it's muffin, isn't it,

36:19.520 --> 36:23.240
for Cinnamon, is having, is basically moving on.

36:23.240 --> 36:26.600
And then there's something we've touched on in this program before, right, that especially

36:26.600 --> 36:30.280
in the open source world, oftentimes these are, this is volunteer labor.

36:30.280 --> 36:33.960
And so any extra emotional baggage, that's hard.

36:33.960 --> 36:39.880
And Clem seems to indicate in the blog post over on the Mint site that it was really the

36:39.880 --> 36:45.440
community's strong negative reaction to logo changes and other changes on the website that

36:45.440 --> 36:48.840
were not actually related to the distribution per se.

36:48.840 --> 36:51.280
And that began the process of demotivating the team.

36:51.280 --> 36:56.120
So it's kind of funny that here we are doing a big art rollout.

36:56.120 --> 37:00.160
And it also, I mean, it does, it kind of talks to you about, there are things other than

37:00.160 --> 37:01.160
technical, right?

37:01.160 --> 37:02.160
We've got a great kernel.

37:02.160 --> 37:05.320
We might even have some great desktop software, but that's not necessarily what determines

37:05.320 --> 37:06.400
our success.

37:06.400 --> 37:11.080
So is desktop Linux collapsing, as SJVN writes?

37:11.080 --> 37:13.920
Because now that Mint's having trouble, it must be collapsing.

37:13.920 --> 37:16.860
I think this would be a good moment before we go any further.

37:16.860 --> 37:18.480
So we're all on the same page.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.300
We're all in alignment, as they say.

37:21.300 --> 37:26.340
Perhaps we could take a moment and define what desktop Linux actually is, because we

37:26.340 --> 37:29.280
may be talking about different things and not even realize it here.

37:29.280 --> 37:32.840
Mr. Wimpers, would you like to take a crack at your definition of desktop Linux?

37:32.840 --> 37:33.840
Yeah.

37:33.840 --> 37:39.560
So quite often, some people will cite Chrome OS, for example, as desktop Linux because

37:39.560 --> 37:42.200
it uses the Linux kernel.

37:42.200 --> 37:45.560
And that doesn't fit my definition, and here's why.

37:45.560 --> 37:52.400
I think of desktop Linux as a desktop Linux operating system where you are able to download

37:52.400 --> 37:59.280
the source code for the current version of the kernel, compile it, install it, and reboot

37:59.280 --> 38:03.200
and boot off that kernel that you've just compiled and built.

38:03.200 --> 38:07.440
And if you can't do that, then in my mind, it's not desktop Linux.

38:07.440 --> 38:11.080
That is not what I expected you to say at all.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.740
Why is that ability important to you?

38:12.740 --> 38:14.040
Is it something you actually use?

38:14.040 --> 38:17.760
Well, not these days, but it's the very...

38:17.760 --> 38:23.480
We talk about this general term of Linux, and that's the basis upon which this whole

38:23.480 --> 38:26.880
platform sits on top of.

38:26.880 --> 38:33.960
And things like Android and Chromium are the productization of the Linux kernel.

38:33.960 --> 38:38.920
And this is great for Linus because all he cares about is the kernel and it becoming

38:38.920 --> 38:41.960
more dominant and more widespread.

38:41.960 --> 38:50.160
But from our point of view, it's usually the Linux kernel with embedded versions of user

38:50.160 --> 38:53.080
space and that whole...

38:53.080 --> 38:57.920
The thing that we like because of its flexibility and all that we can do with it is being taken

38:57.920 --> 38:58.920
away from us.

38:58.920 --> 39:05.160
So I think unless you've got compilers and the tool chain and the ability to compile,

39:05.160 --> 39:09.440
build and then reboot your desktop operating system off the kernel that you've just built,

39:09.440 --> 39:14.680
then it's not desktop Linux, it's something else.

39:14.680 --> 39:17.720
I could accept that definition for the purposes of our discussion today.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.420
Could you accept that definition?

39:19.420 --> 39:22.360
It's an interesting bar, but I think it's a fascinating one.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.920
If you can't stand it up yourself, it's not really a free desktop environment.

39:25.920 --> 39:30.000
I mean, there are a lot of things I think that's an important philosophy in our community

39:30.000 --> 39:31.840
in terms of being able to tinker and explore.

39:31.840 --> 39:36.680
And those are often cited concerns about playing and learning from Linux.

39:36.680 --> 39:41.120
You can get your work done on Linux or Windows, but if you want to go learn how to build computer

39:41.120 --> 39:45.320
boots and be able to play with that and teach yourself, you probably need Linux or at least

39:45.320 --> 39:47.880
something approaching Wimpy's definition.

39:47.880 --> 39:52.560
I would say, however, that if I find myself compiling a kernel from source and having

39:52.560 --> 39:56.240
to boot off it, I am reconsidering my life choices at that point as well.

39:56.240 --> 40:01.040
This is not something that I think you need to be doing on a regular basis unless you're

40:01.040 --> 40:05.920
a kernel developer or working on some new hardware device.

40:05.920 --> 40:12.920
I think that it's that kind of flexibility that really expresses what distributions are

40:12.920 --> 40:16.080
and their heritage, their legacy.

40:16.080 --> 40:19.740
I think I'm inclined to agree because otherwise it's just a black box.

40:19.740 --> 40:23.840
It's no different than a set-top box that's got a TiVo, that's got a pre-compiled kernel.

40:23.840 --> 40:24.840
An appliance?

40:24.840 --> 40:25.840
Yeah, it's an appliance.

40:25.840 --> 40:29.320
And that's what a Chrome laptop or a Chrome box is.

40:29.320 --> 40:33.920
Whereas something where you can go and get an ISO image and install it on the hardware

40:33.920 --> 40:41.040
of your choice with choices you make at the software level is a completely different experience

40:41.040 --> 40:43.960
than buying a box that is non-modifiable.

40:43.960 --> 40:48.040
See, this is interesting because Chris, you and I, we've been talking a lot about in the

40:48.040 --> 40:49.040
studio, appliances.

40:49.040 --> 40:53.560
So it makes me question like, okay, that does seem like a very reasonable definition of

40:53.560 --> 40:54.560
Linux desktop.

40:54.560 --> 40:57.200
But does that mean I just don't want that much Linux desktop?

40:57.200 --> 41:02.440
If we're okay with things like Chromebooks or tablets or that we do think are useful

41:02.440 --> 41:06.880
or some do, does that just mean the Linux desktop wasn't the thing that was right?

41:06.880 --> 41:07.880
Yeah.

41:07.880 --> 41:13.680
I mean, I think Linus, as Wimpy very well pointed out, is completely happy with Linux

41:13.680 --> 41:17.720
being an implementation detail because it's still using his kernel.

41:17.720 --> 41:19.880
And that's a great observation.

41:19.880 --> 41:21.080
And Linus has said as much himself.

41:21.080 --> 41:23.480
I've actually heard Linus say as much himself in an interview.

41:23.480 --> 41:25.760
So I think that's very astute.

41:25.760 --> 41:30.640
And for the purpose of this conversation, I'm going to accept that definition.

41:30.640 --> 41:32.840
And I'd love to hear the audience's definition, too.

41:32.840 --> 41:34.600
So please do send it in.

41:34.600 --> 41:41.060
But okay, so that version of the desktop, is that a failure in a sense?

41:41.060 --> 41:44.920
So that's what SJVN's point is with these distributions struggling.

41:44.920 --> 41:49.400
He writes, also he points out in this article, like a lot of popular desktop distributions

41:49.400 --> 41:55.720
are getting by on a shoestring budget, barely holding it together, operating sort of like,

41:55.720 --> 41:59.440
you know, month to month almost in terms of revenue.

41:59.440 --> 42:03.040
We've seen issues with some smaller distributions recently.

42:03.040 --> 42:08.800
You look at projects like Manjaro, Linux, and others, they're not making a ton of money.

42:08.800 --> 42:11.780
You know, they're barely getting by essentially.

42:11.780 --> 42:15.340
And so he says that that doesn't set them up for long term success.

42:15.340 --> 42:20.300
And then, you know, you look at other numbers, like the valve market share numbers for Linux,

42:20.300 --> 42:24.780
we're still sub 1% after all of this time.

42:24.780 --> 42:31.620
In February 2019, we had a decent size, like 0.77%.

42:31.620 --> 42:37.160
And now it looks like in March, now it may be edging up to 0.82%.

42:37.160 --> 42:38.160
0.82.

42:38.160 --> 42:45.440
I think those numbers are actually impressive, because that's against a backdrop of a rapidly

42:45.440 --> 42:51.540
growing Steam user market when you take into account Windows.

42:51.540 --> 42:59.120
So the fact that we're actually holding that, you know, slightly under 1% is actually growth

42:59.120 --> 43:00.120
in real terms.

43:00.120 --> 43:01.120
I'll agree with that.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.120
Yeah, actually.

43:02.120 --> 43:05.840
I mean, we have like some more descriptive statistics ideally, but that's a great point.

43:05.840 --> 43:10.200
I've gotten like the Steam hardware survey once ever, ever.

43:10.200 --> 43:12.600
I got it three times in one day.

43:12.600 --> 43:13.600
And it was brilliant.

43:13.600 --> 43:14.600
Wow.

43:14.600 --> 43:15.600
Yeah.

43:15.600 --> 43:16.600
I got it twice over the weekend.

43:16.600 --> 43:17.600
Really?

43:17.600 --> 43:18.600
Yeah.

43:18.600 --> 43:23.160
I got it on my Linux PC, and I submitted it, and then got it on my Windows PC and said

43:23.160 --> 43:24.160
no.

43:24.160 --> 43:26.880
Good man.

43:26.880 --> 43:34.000
If you're curious, Mac OS is at a healthy 3.27% market share, Windows coming in at 95.91%.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.120
Okay, so I don't think that Linux is screwed.

43:39.120 --> 43:42.240
I mean, I was kind of trying to, you know, get a little distract a little out of you

43:42.240 --> 43:43.240
guys.

43:43.240 --> 43:44.240
I don't think it is.

43:44.240 --> 43:45.240
I think it's in pretty good shape.

43:45.240 --> 43:52.440
Yeah, I think citing those smaller projects as it's all wobbly because those smaller projects

43:52.440 --> 43:56.020
are struggling is looking in the wrong place, right?

43:56.020 --> 44:01.080
Because it's unfortunate that those smaller distributions are struggling, and I hope that

44:01.080 --> 44:05.320
they continue to go from strength to strength, and they get the funding that they need to

44:05.320 --> 44:06.320
continue.

44:06.320 --> 44:11.080
But that is not where the majority of Linux users are.

44:11.080 --> 44:19.040
The majority of Linux users on the desktop are running Ubuntu or one of the derivatives.

44:19.040 --> 44:26.280
I mean, Ubuntu is by far and away the most widely used Linux desktop operating system.

44:26.280 --> 44:34.160
And second place is Mint, and Mint dwarfs most of the other Linux-based operating systems.

44:34.160 --> 44:35.160
Right.

44:35.160 --> 44:37.800
And in that article, Ubuntu is sort of dismissed out of hand.

44:37.800 --> 44:39.440
Oh, Canonical is worried about the server.

44:39.440 --> 44:42.680
I've got thoughts about that, if you want to dig into that.

44:42.680 --> 44:43.680
I was curious.

44:43.680 --> 44:45.440
I was curious what your thoughts are about that.

44:45.440 --> 44:46.440
Right.

44:46.440 --> 44:47.440
Okay.

44:47.440 --> 44:52.700
So on that point about we only care about server, certainly, there's a lot of investment

44:52.700 --> 44:57.360
of time and energy in server and cloud because yes, there's a lot of money and business opportunity

44:57.360 --> 44:58.360
there.

44:58.360 --> 45:01.040
But as a company, we care about the desktop.

45:01.040 --> 45:08.560
And also personally, Mark Shuttleworth also still cares very much about the Ubuntu desktop.

45:08.560 --> 45:15.960
He has limited time to spend looking at individual products within the Ubuntu product family.

45:15.960 --> 45:21.720
But one of the products that he spends time personally looking into is the Ubuntu desktop.

45:21.720 --> 45:24.560
So within Canonical, it's important to us.

45:24.560 --> 45:25.760
So I don't buy that at all.

45:25.760 --> 45:28.440
That is somebody from the outside speculating.

45:28.440 --> 45:34.920
Also those Linux distributions, those tiny Linux distributions that are cited in the

45:34.920 --> 45:43.240
article as having trouble, one could argue, why do they need to be super successful?

45:43.240 --> 45:48.920
Because a lot of them are a couple of guys who are making something as a passion project

45:48.920 --> 45:49.920
for themselves.

45:49.920 --> 45:52.120
They don't necessarily need to make millions.

45:52.120 --> 45:56.560
And for the majority of them that are based off of Ubuntu, or based off of Debian, they're

45:56.560 --> 45:58.560
not even hosting their own archive.

45:58.560 --> 46:04.640
So they're not even having to pay out, like if in the real world, they were a real proper

46:04.640 --> 46:09.720
Linux desktop distribution, they would have their own archive, and they would have to

46:09.720 --> 46:14.240
host gigabytes and gigabytes of packages, and they'd have to find somewhere to build

46:14.240 --> 46:15.240
all of that software.

46:15.240 --> 46:16.240
But they don't.

46:16.240 --> 46:19.280
They rely on Ubuntu or Debian to do that for them.

46:19.280 --> 46:26.440
And so I think they're doing pretty well, that any rando on the internet can spin up

46:26.440 --> 46:33.040
a distro and manage to sustain it for probably years with very minimal investment.

46:33.040 --> 46:36.960
And thanks, Mark, for paying for that hosting and the build system.

46:36.960 --> 46:37.960
Thanks very much.

46:37.960 --> 46:41.560
And the security team and the kernel team and all the rest of it.

46:41.560 --> 46:44.300
So the argument really is a bit of a straw man.

46:44.300 --> 46:48.120
And that's where I was going with this is I think Linux desktop is doing just fine.

46:48.120 --> 46:50.040
It depends on which lens you're looking at.

46:50.040 --> 46:53.640
In fact, Emma, you were kind of pointed out like even Linus himself, if you get him at

46:53.640 --> 46:56.480
the right time of day, or you ask him the right question, he kind of has a totally different

46:56.480 --> 46:57.480
opinion, doesn't he?

46:57.480 --> 47:03.760
Yeah, and I think that the CDNIT always kind of sensationalizes and draws weird conclusions

47:03.760 --> 47:08.040
that aren't necessarily the real situation.

47:08.040 --> 47:09.040
Yeah.

47:09.040 --> 47:10.040
Yeah.

47:10.040 --> 47:11.040
Linus takes a long term look at it.

47:11.040 --> 47:14.640
He says, like, long term, unless something major changes, I think Linux is going to own

47:14.640 --> 47:15.640
the desktop.

47:15.640 --> 47:16.880
It's just going to take a while to get there.

47:16.880 --> 47:22.480
And I think part of it, too, is in a weird way, our fragmentation is actually going to

47:22.480 --> 47:23.660
save us here.

47:23.660 --> 47:25.200
Stick with me for a second.

47:25.200 --> 47:30.880
I actually think the fact that and I use fragmentation very broadly here, my definition of fragmentation

47:30.880 --> 47:34.720
is multiple distributions, right, and all different kinds of architectures running all

47:34.720 --> 47:41.200
kinds of different form factors, like, in that sense, Linux is sort of always being

47:41.200 --> 47:43.500
built for all of these different edge cases, right?

47:43.500 --> 47:46.960
You combine that with the ability to compile it wherever you want and run it where you

47:46.960 --> 47:47.960
need it.

47:47.960 --> 47:51.620
And it can be the first thing in whatever next computing factors that exists.

47:51.620 --> 47:52.620
That's what I'm saying.

47:52.620 --> 47:56.440
It's a universal operating system that's generally available, that's great.

47:56.440 --> 47:59.720
That if there's the next hardware platform that takes off, if it's not, you know, whatever

47:59.720 --> 48:04.080
is after x86, if it's ARM or whatever, that becomes like the mainstream that we have in

48:04.080 --> 48:07.140
our laptops and desktops, Linux is there already.

48:07.140 --> 48:08.360
It's going to be there already.

48:08.360 --> 48:10.720
Anything that's in the market, it's going to have great support for it.

48:10.720 --> 48:15.100
It'll take commercial vendors years to turn that around.

48:15.100 --> 48:16.260
So Linux has that.

48:16.260 --> 48:19.960
And you can see it, like, think about it even in the form factors.

48:19.960 --> 48:24.880
Mr. Wimpey here has a pretty big update for people that have the GPT Pocket.

48:24.880 --> 48:25.880
Yeah.

48:25.880 --> 48:31.600
So I did some work back in October to make some initial images for the GPT Pocket and

48:31.600 --> 48:36.000
the GPT Pocket 2 for Ubuntu 18.10.

48:36.000 --> 48:42.760
And since I released those, I had some feedback from people that have got those devices to

48:42.760 --> 48:44.720
further improve them.

48:44.720 --> 48:52.040
And because 1804.2 has come out now, which shares its hardware enablement stack with

48:52.040 --> 48:58.320
18.10, it meant that everything was in place to create a fresh image based on the LTS now

48:58.320 --> 49:01.380
because all the requisite hardware support was there.

49:01.380 --> 49:07.280
So I've uplifted those images and then taken some ideas from the community contributors

49:07.280 --> 49:09.800
to improve them further still.

49:09.800 --> 49:11.240
So I'm really very happy with them.

49:11.240 --> 49:15.360
I've got each of those devices, and I have to say it's transformed them.

49:15.360 --> 49:16.720
I'm really very pleased with them.

49:16.720 --> 49:17.720
All right.

49:17.720 --> 49:18.720
Be honest, though.

49:18.720 --> 49:19.720
How's the performance?

49:19.720 --> 49:23.840
The GPT Pocket 1 is okay.

49:23.840 --> 49:25.360
It's fairly decent.

49:25.360 --> 49:28.280
It's not going to set any world records or anything.

49:28.280 --> 49:29.280
It's okay.

49:29.280 --> 49:32.400
The GPT Pocket 2 is actually very good.

49:32.400 --> 49:39.480
It's got the same hardware specs as a MacBook in terms of CPU and RAM and all the rest of

49:39.480 --> 49:40.480
it.

49:40.480 --> 49:47.560
The eMMC storage is a bit lackluster, but in terms of everything else, it's actually

49:47.560 --> 49:49.560
very, very usable indeed.

49:49.560 --> 49:51.240
They're quite nice little devices.

49:51.240 --> 49:56.680
They're what I pack in my bags when we go away at the weekends to visit family because

49:56.680 --> 50:01.500
I've actually got a full boy Linux desktop literally in my pocket.

50:01.500 --> 50:02.500
With a QWERTY keyboard.

50:02.500 --> 50:03.500
Yeah, yeah.

50:03.500 --> 50:11.720
It's got a keyboard and a touchpad and touchscreen and HDMI and USB 3 and USB-C. It's got everything

50:11.720 --> 50:13.880
you need to get stuff done.

50:13.880 --> 50:16.240
I really like them.

50:16.240 --> 50:20.120
It's not like the Raspberry Pi where there's tens of millions of these things.

50:20.120 --> 50:24.740
Maybe there's tens of thousands of these in the wild, but they came to prominence because

50:24.740 --> 50:30.000
their initial crowd funder offered Ubuntu and Windows options, and subsequently they've

50:30.000 --> 50:38.480
not offered a Linux operating system by default.

50:38.480 --> 50:43.720
Since I've made these images, SoftWin, which is the parent company, have been in touch

50:43.720 --> 50:49.760
with me, and they're now supplying me with engineering samples of their upcoming devices.

50:49.760 --> 50:56.080
They now list Ubuntu MATE as a firmware option on their website.

50:56.080 --> 51:01.200
It's a small group of people that would ordinarily be running Windows, and now they have an out-of-box

51:01.200 --> 51:08.060
... You can install any Linux on these devices, but then there's a dozen really quirky tweaks

51:08.060 --> 51:14.440
you have to do to rotate the screen and the touch point resolution on the touchscreen

51:14.440 --> 51:16.100
and all the rest of it.

51:16.100 --> 51:20.400
Just having them pre-baked so you can just install it and it all just works as you accept

51:20.400 --> 51:26.400
it means that there's a group of potential users out there who are going to have a decent

51:26.400 --> 51:30.680
introduction to Linux and not think, why is everything rotated 90 degrees, and why does

51:30.680 --> 51:32.160
audio not work and all that.

51:32.160 --> 51:33.160
That's amazing.

51:33.160 --> 51:34.800
Internet strangers have made your device work.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.460
This is case in point right here.

51:36.460 --> 51:41.680
You see, this is the home turf advantage that Linux has on all of these future form factors

51:41.680 --> 51:43.720
and platforms.

51:43.720 --> 51:47.340
There might not be tens of millions of GBD pockets one day, but if there ever were something

51:47.340 --> 51:49.080
like that to take off, Linux is going to be there.

51:49.080 --> 51:50.080
It sure would.

51:50.080 --> 51:51.760
You're making me jealous I don't have one of those, too.

51:51.760 --> 51:53.520
I think that might be one of the coolest devices.

51:53.520 --> 51:55.640
I want that with me all the time in my bag.

51:55.640 --> 51:56.640
Yeah.

51:56.640 --> 51:58.120
I think that's really cool.

51:58.120 --> 52:02.200
Well, great work, and 1904 as well is on there.

52:02.200 --> 52:03.200
It's the beta.

52:03.200 --> 52:07.040
It's the 1904 beta.

52:07.040 --> 52:13.280
When the final images drop, I will have 1904 final images available for those two devices

52:13.280 --> 52:14.280
as well ready to go.

52:14.280 --> 52:15.280
I don't know, man.

52:15.280 --> 52:16.280
I like it.

52:16.280 --> 52:17.280
I'm getting tempted.

52:17.280 --> 52:23.440
I'll have in the show notes a link to a SlashGear article that also covers reasons to abandon

52:23.440 --> 52:24.880
Windows for Linux.

52:24.880 --> 52:30.680
What I liked about it is I had a bunch of, oh, yeah, right, that is a thing that is really

52:30.680 --> 52:36.200
nice like software catalogs that are nice and curated and everything's free in there.

52:36.200 --> 52:38.960
Smooth operating system updates that don't nag you like crazy.

52:38.960 --> 52:42.720
A highly customizable interface which feels like total freedom when you're a power user

52:42.720 --> 52:49.760
coming from Windows, and of course, less tracking, free updates for life.

52:49.760 --> 52:54.400
One of the things about Linux and free software that I think could be more and more a selling

52:54.400 --> 53:01.560
point as all of these large tech companies go more and more towards subscription revenue,

53:01.560 --> 53:03.600
it's only a matter of time.

53:03.600 --> 53:07.280
Actually, I do think there are subscription options now for Windows, and there's just

53:07.280 --> 53:11.760
going to be more ways like Office 365 is another subscription.

53:11.760 --> 53:14.080
Free software is subscription free.

53:14.080 --> 53:16.120
You get the operating system, and you've got it forever.

53:16.120 --> 53:20.640
But the reason why I'm leaving the article for you to read on your own in the notes is

53:20.640 --> 53:23.960
because I got a couple of really cool picks.

53:23.960 --> 53:27.520
I've been reading these articles about the old web disappearing, and we just changed

53:27.520 --> 53:35.120
up our website, totally, finally dark theme, hey, hey, dark theme, and in a way, I was

53:35.120 --> 53:38.520
kind of like, oh, yeah, but now the old site's gone.

53:38.520 --> 53:39.520
It's a history.

53:39.520 --> 53:44.040
So I started thinking about ways to archive web pages because we also have a problem where

53:44.040 --> 53:47.680
sometimes we're researching something for a story and the website goes away.

53:47.680 --> 53:50.720
It doesn't happen a lot, but it's happened.

53:50.720 --> 53:56.760
So I was looking for ways to completely archive websites, even ones that have like JavaScript

53:56.760 --> 53:59.520
in them, and that gets rendered.

53:59.520 --> 54:02.440
So I was looking for more than your average bear of an archive.

54:02.440 --> 54:08.200
And so I found a couple, and I got a quickie, and then I got a really cool complicated one.

54:08.200 --> 54:10.720
So the first one is simple.

54:10.720 --> 54:14.560
It's WK, I don't know what it, HTML to PDF.

54:14.560 --> 54:16.320
It's a series of scripts.

54:16.320 --> 54:17.840
Does it do what it says it does?

54:17.840 --> 54:18.840
Yeah.

54:18.840 --> 54:21.400
And it creates PDFs from web pages, GPL3.

54:21.400 --> 54:22.400
It's actually pretty cool.

54:22.400 --> 54:26.480
It uses YouTube DL and a bunch of other stuff to get all the images and run the JavaScript

54:26.480 --> 54:28.880
and render it out headless so you don't have to have a browser up.

54:28.880 --> 54:32.920
It can do it scripted in a cron job, and then it can just jump websites out to PDF.

54:32.920 --> 54:33.920
Right, yeah.

54:33.920 --> 54:34.920
I mean, right there, they have kind of an example.

54:34.920 --> 54:36.680
You could use it to back up a Wiki.

54:36.680 --> 54:39.340
That would be a perfect thing printed out as documentation.

54:39.340 --> 54:42.160
You can run it entirely headless, and then you just have the PDFs in a folder.

54:42.160 --> 54:43.680
You wake up, and there's your morning edition.

54:43.680 --> 54:47.240
I hope that you don't want a bunch of PDFs, but if you do, this seems like a great way

54:47.240 --> 54:48.240
to get them.

54:48.240 --> 54:52.200
You can also do it as images, I suppose.

54:52.200 --> 54:53.200
I don't know.

54:53.200 --> 54:54.200
A PDF just seems to be the default.

54:54.200 --> 54:57.200
And yeah, it's using a cute WebKit rendering engine.

54:57.200 --> 54:58.200
So it's got a real web.

54:58.200 --> 54:59.200
That's fantastic.

54:59.200 --> 55:00.200
Yeah.

55:00.200 --> 55:01.200
It's got a real web render, so that's pretty nice.

55:01.200 --> 55:02.200
All right.

55:02.200 --> 55:03.820
But let's say you wanted to go like full pack rat.

55:03.820 --> 55:04.840
Check this thing out.

55:04.840 --> 55:07.640
This is some super cool free software.

55:07.640 --> 55:09.500
It's called ArchiveBox.

55:09.500 --> 55:13.320
It's the open source, self-hosted web archive.

55:13.320 --> 55:17.560
ArchiveBox takes a list of the website URLs you want to archive and creates a local, static,

55:17.560 --> 55:20.640
browsable HTML clone of the content from those websites.

55:20.640 --> 55:25.640
It saves the HTML, the JavaScript, media files, PDF, images, videos, all of it.

55:25.640 --> 55:26.640
Videos?

55:26.640 --> 55:27.640
Yeah.

55:27.640 --> 55:28.640
It's really cool, Wes.

55:28.640 --> 55:30.840
You can use it to preserve access to websites you care about, like say you just give it

55:30.840 --> 55:33.400
your bookmarks file and just have it go archive it all for you.

55:33.400 --> 55:36.940
Yeah, you know what really stood out to me, though, is it can import and export links

55:36.940 --> 55:41.220
as JSON, and they've explicitly added some stuff to make it easy to hook in with an API.

55:41.220 --> 55:44.120
So maybe if you want to have some sort of interactive bot or scripting engine that you

55:44.120 --> 55:47.360
go crawl out and find the stuff you want to archive, hook it into this.

55:47.360 --> 55:48.760
It's got the rest taken care of.

55:48.760 --> 55:50.220
That's pretty cool.

55:50.220 --> 55:55.720
And it's a little more capable because it's using Chrome Headless and YouTube DL again.

55:55.720 --> 55:57.280
Wow.

55:57.280 --> 55:58.920
I don't think I need this.

55:58.920 --> 55:59.920
Set it up.

55:59.920 --> 56:00.920
Let it go.

56:00.920 --> 56:03.380
But a lot of people do really care about archiving the web, and there's some good research

56:03.380 --> 56:04.380
there.

56:04.380 --> 56:06.840
So it's nice to have tools because sometimes you just need documentation.

56:06.840 --> 56:08.920
Yeah, it's really easy to do, too.

56:08.920 --> 56:09.920
It's pretty great.

56:09.920 --> 56:13.860
So I have links in the show notes in your podcast catcher of choice or Linux unplugged.com

56:13.860 --> 56:14.860
slash 296.

56:14.860 --> 56:15.860
296.

56:15.860 --> 56:20.440
So people have been doing the math and they've been like, hey, guys, you know, like Linux

56:20.440 --> 56:23.580
Fest like is when episode 300 lands.

56:23.580 --> 56:24.580
It's just crazy.

56:24.580 --> 56:28.080
I don't know what we're going to do because we won't have as many people in town.

56:28.080 --> 56:31.920
Because everyone will just just be leaving after the fest.

56:31.920 --> 56:35.200
Well, and we'll be I'm losing my voice today.

56:35.200 --> 56:37.120
Maybe I won't even have my voice right.

56:37.120 --> 56:40.800
And we will we'll be hung over for sure, without a doubt.

56:40.800 --> 56:43.400
So it's probably going to be a horrible episode, I would imagine.

56:43.400 --> 56:44.400
Probably one of our worst.

56:44.400 --> 56:47.360
You know, you know how you could help, though, is come join us live.

56:47.360 --> 56:48.360
That's true.

56:48.360 --> 56:49.360
Hey, nice.

56:49.360 --> 56:50.360
Turn that around, didn't you?

56:50.360 --> 56:52.960
Yeah, you can get in the mama room and go over to jblive.tv and stream it.

56:52.960 --> 56:55.320
When we fall asleep, you can make sure there's no dead air.

56:55.320 --> 56:58.000
We've been using just a super quick thing, then we got to get out of here.

56:58.000 --> 57:03.500
We've been using Jack the last couple of days on our OBS machine to do inline processing

57:03.500 --> 57:07.960
to add a little compression and the limiter and sort of bring the volume up a little bit

57:07.960 --> 57:09.920
on our live streams, which were a little low before.

57:09.920 --> 57:10.920
Yeah.

57:10.920 --> 57:12.880
So hopefully that's sounding better out there, dear listeners.

57:12.880 --> 57:15.040
You put it you piped it all together pretty well.

57:15.040 --> 57:17.880
It's like using compression and stuff inside Jack, right?

57:17.880 --> 57:18.880
So it's all inline.

57:18.880 --> 57:19.880
Nothing too fancy.

57:19.880 --> 57:22.560
And then OBS just has a jack input source.

57:22.560 --> 57:23.560
So that works.

57:23.560 --> 57:24.600
No problem.

57:24.600 --> 57:25.800
So OBS is Jack aware.

57:25.800 --> 57:26.800
Oh, yeah.

57:26.800 --> 57:27.800
Jack smart.

57:27.800 --> 57:33.120
Go get more West Tech snap dot systems and that Kota radio I mentioned, but and also

57:33.120 --> 57:34.120
at Westpain.

57:34.120 --> 57:35.120
Happy birthday, Mr. Paine.

57:35.120 --> 57:36.120
Oh, thank you.

57:36.120 --> 57:39.520
You can go hear more poppy and Mr. Wimpy over at the boon to podcast.

57:39.520 --> 57:41.440
It's back, baby.

57:41.440 --> 57:42.440
Great first episode, guys.

57:42.440 --> 57:43.440
I really enjoyed it.

57:43.440 --> 57:44.440
It was nice hearing.

57:44.440 --> 57:45.440
I really like that.

57:45.440 --> 57:46.440
You just sort of.

57:46.440 --> 57:48.400
Well, I don't want to give it away, but I like the topic decision you made.

57:48.400 --> 57:52.400
I know that was probably kind of a hard choice to make potentially because I have a hard

57:52.400 --> 57:53.480
time doing that.

57:53.480 --> 57:54.480
But you guys did great.

57:54.480 --> 57:55.480
I really enjoyed it.

57:55.480 --> 57:56.480
I won't give it away.

57:56.480 --> 57:57.480
Go check it out.

57:57.480 --> 57:58.480
Thank you.

57:58.480 --> 57:59.480
Welcome back, gentlemen.

57:59.480 --> 58:00.480
It's nice to have you.

58:00.480 --> 58:01.480
Thank you.

58:01.480 --> 58:02.480
Amongst us again.

58:02.480 --> 58:03.480
Thank you very much.

58:03.480 --> 58:04.480
And let's see.

58:04.480 --> 58:05.480
What else?

58:05.480 --> 58:06.480
Go check out Emma.

58:06.480 --> 58:07.480
She's at social happiness on the Twitter.

58:07.480 --> 58:08.480
Nice to have you today, Emma.

58:08.480 --> 58:09.480
Thank you for making it.

58:09.480 --> 58:10.480
Thanks for having me.

58:10.480 --> 58:11.480
And hey, Al.

58:11.480 --> 58:13.280
Why don't you give give the folks your Twitter handle?

58:13.280 --> 58:14.280
Maybe they're going to be somewhere where you're at.

58:14.280 --> 58:15.280
They want to get hold.

58:15.280 --> 58:16.280
You give them your Twitter handle.

58:16.280 --> 58:21.040
I'm at L underscore O underscore punk at hello punk.

58:21.040 --> 58:22.040
Hello.

58:22.040 --> 58:23.040
Oh, really?

58:23.040 --> 58:24.040
Amazing.

58:24.040 --> 58:25.640
I never really put that together.

58:25.640 --> 58:28.240
Bacon, do you have a you have a Twitter over there?

58:28.240 --> 58:29.240
You tweet.

58:29.240 --> 58:30.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:30.240 --> 58:31.640
Yeah, that's just cheese bacon.

58:31.640 --> 58:32.640
All the places.

58:32.640 --> 58:33.640
Is it C H Z or me?

58:33.640 --> 58:34.640
Right.

58:34.640 --> 58:35.640
Yeah.

58:35.640 --> 58:36.640
OK.

58:36.640 --> 58:37.640
You got to get the spelling right.

58:37.640 --> 58:38.640
Absolutely.

58:38.640 --> 58:39.640
Well, I mean, it's C H Z.

58:39.640 --> 58:40.640
B A C U N.

58:40.640 --> 58:41.640
But nobody has time to actually spell out cheese.

58:41.640 --> 58:42.640
Like, really?

58:42.640 --> 58:43.640
Nobody does.

58:43.640 --> 58:44.640
It's too hip.

58:44.640 --> 58:45.640
Yeah, it's too hip.

58:45.640 --> 58:46.640
It's too hip.

58:46.640 --> 58:49.480
And then last and absolutely least, you know what?

58:49.480 --> 58:52.240
Let's give let's give a plug for our editor.

58:52.240 --> 58:53.240
Go check out old dad Joe Rez.

58:53.240 --> 58:54.240
Joe Rez.

58:54.240 --> 58:55.240
On the old Twitter.

58:55.240 --> 58:56.240
Yeah.

58:56.240 --> 58:57.240
You guys just had your own birthday celebration.

58:57.240 --> 58:58.240
That's true.

58:58.240 --> 58:59.240
We just had Land 100.

58:59.240 --> 59:00.240
Yeah.

59:00.240 --> 59:01.240
Congratulations.

59:01.240 --> 59:02.240
It's a great little show.

59:02.240 --> 59:03.240
Thank you.

59:03.240 --> 59:06.240
Yeah, we've we've we've had moments where, like, I was almost dying and you stepped in

59:06.240 --> 59:09.240
for me, you know, but otherwise it's been I mean, I've been there for a lot of them.

59:09.240 --> 59:11.760
It's the consistent source of all the things you need to start your week.

59:11.760 --> 59:12.760
Yeah, it's nice.

59:12.760 --> 59:15.400
It's nice having a team, you know, and one of the things that's cool behind the scenes

59:15.400 --> 59:17.800
is we've got somebody doing more research full time on that.

59:17.800 --> 59:20.040
Well, not I mean, that's his full time task.

59:20.040 --> 59:22.600
So it's it's pretty great.

59:22.600 --> 59:24.560
We can have more reach, just like you said.

59:24.560 --> 59:25.560
Yeah, absolutely.

59:25.560 --> 59:26.560
All right.

59:26.560 --> 59:28.440
Well, last and absolutely least, I am at Chris LAS.

59:28.440 --> 59:29.720
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

59:29.720 --> 59:33.040
There's now Twitter accounts for all the shows, too.

59:33.040 --> 59:35.680
Which can be handy, like if something big's going on, like if we're doing like a live

59:35.680 --> 59:38.480
stream of a barbecue grill session.

59:38.480 --> 59:39.480
So just go give those a follow.

59:39.480 --> 59:41.680
I think it's at Linux Unplugged.

59:41.680 --> 59:42.680
That it is.

59:42.680 --> 59:43.680
Go take it over.

59:43.680 --> 59:44.680
Go be like one of the first.

59:44.680 --> 59:45.680
Go own that thing.

59:45.680 --> 59:46.920
And last but not least, please do join us next Tuesday.

59:46.920 --> 59:50.040
You can go to Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash calendar to get it converted to your

59:50.040 --> 59:51.040
local time.

59:51.040 --> 59:54.520
You can hang out in our IRC room IRC dot Geek Shed dot net pound hashtag.

59:54.520 --> 59:55.520
Jupiter Broadcasting.

59:55.520 --> 01:00:00.120
And of course, that mumble room.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.880
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:31.760
And I hope to see you right back here, not Monday, next Tuesday!

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:51.000
So while the people vote, I thought in the post show here, we could have a little fun.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.480
How about a second unboxing?

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.480
Is that ridiculous?

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.480
Isn't that ridiculous?

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.480
Do it.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:56.780
So JBtitles dot com.

01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.280
Everybody go vote while we do this.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.280
JBtitles dot com.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.280
You gotta go vote right now.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.920
Because we gotta get a good title and then we can get out of here.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.480
And I really wish you had a video feed because I wanted to see the stickers so bad.

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.480
I know.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:08.280
They do look really good, too.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.760
I'm really happy with how they turned out.

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:14.840
I think they turned out probably better than I was expecting.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:15.840
I think.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:16.840
I think they probably did.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:17.840
All right.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:23.360
So Mr. West, in front of you right now is something that I ordered just, I believe,

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.360
last week.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:25.360
Didn't we talk about this last episode?

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.640
Yeah, I ordered the Raspberry Pi keyboard.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:32.000
The first Raspberry Pi dedicated keyboard.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.480
So Mr. Payne, do you have anything to cut the tape?

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.480
I guess we should have thought of that.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.480
Yeah, we should have.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.480
We need a sharp object.

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.440
The unplanned unboxings are not as smooth.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.440
I gotta admit.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.440
Hmm.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.440
You got anything sharp?

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.440
Yeah.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:49.360
Mr. Payne, now open the Raspberry Pi box.

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:50.360
All right.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.400
It feels light, right?

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.400
My first impressions.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.400
It does feel light.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:57.160
It's a nice flat matte box with a good Raspberry Pi design on it.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:58.160
Bold logo.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.160
Securely packaged.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.160
Branding.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.280
It arrived quickly, I gotta admit.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.280
It comes...

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.280
Do you need me to open that?

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.280
What's going on over there?

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.280
Let me see this thing.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.280
There's just more tape, I guess.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.280
Oh, no.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.280
There's more tape?

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.280
The snare drum player's getting tired.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.280
I know, right?

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.280
Okay, I almost got it.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.280
I almost got it.

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.280
You got it.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.280
I almost got it.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.280
Here we go.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.280
Okay, West.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.280
Here you go.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.280
Now you can continue.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.280
Now, what do you think?

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.280
Oh, okay.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.280
It does feel pretty light.

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:25.280
Yeah.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.280
It's handsome.

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.840
Now we are bathed in a red glow, so it's hard to get a real good...

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.360
It does have red trim, though, too.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.360
It has like a...

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.600
It looks kind of like a sports keyboard.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.240
Key little red cord to match.

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.240
I'm gonna rip it open.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.240
I just wanna get at it.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.280
Did you say it was handsome, West?

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.280
Uh-huh.

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.780
Okay, so my first reaction is, is if you're familiar with what the Apple Magic Keyboard,

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:46.800
their external keyboard feels like, that's sort of what the keys feel like, and they're

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.800
about that shape.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.760
But the font is much more readable, much, much larger.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.600
It's got a nice set of that little hub right on the back there.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:54.600
I mean, I don't...

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.360
I mean, this is, of course, gonna be different for everybody, but if you have a little bit

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.400
of trouble reading or you're learning how to type, this keyboard could be really nice

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:05.400
because it's very approachable, and the lettering is very, very big.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.920
It feels very solid.

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:12.060
It's got a little bulge on the back of it where the electronics are, but then it thins

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:14.840
out towards the space bar on the back of it.

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:17.280
It's very much like a laptop keyboard, like the way the arrow keys are there.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.280
How do you feel about that?

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.280
Oh, yeah, you're right.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:23.120
Doesn't that kind of feel like a Magic Keyboard a little bit, but a plastic version of it?

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.120
A plastic version, yeah.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.120
Yeah, lighter.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.120
Kind of about the...

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.120
A little bit lighter, yeah.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:30.560
Yeah, that's actually not bad.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:31.840
I think for the price, it's actually worth it.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:32.840
I think that's actually...

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:33.840
I think I'm pretty happy with that purchase.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:34.840
It works.

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.840
It's working on your machine now?

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.840
Yeah.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.840
Plugged it right in.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:38.840
There you go.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.840
I actually...

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:40.840
I'm gonna say it's a recommend.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.880
Have you seen where someone's already put a Raspberry Pi Zero in it?

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:43.880
No.

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:44.880
Yeah.

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:47.240
They already tossed like a Pi Zero in it and set it all up.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.440
So basically, just plug it.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.440
I love the internet.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.440
I love the internet.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.720
Plug it, see if you can go to the side of it and go, man.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.840
That's a great way to play around with Linux.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:00.120
Jupiter Chainsaw Massacre, even BSD looks good.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.120
Now we can't give away...

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.080
We can't give away one of the punchlines in the title, guys.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.080
I mean, I do like that.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.080
That's a good one, Social Happiness.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.080
That's a good one.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.400
But I don't want to give away the title.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.120
I don't want to give away a punchline in the title.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.120
Brent, how the hell are you?

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.120
Good, man.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.120
How is everybody?

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.120
Good.

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.120
Good.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:15.120
I saw you sneak in there.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.120
I didn't get a chance to give you a call out, but I did see you sneak in there and just

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.120
under the cover.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.380
Yeah, you know, sometimes they're late.

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:19.380
Sometimes they're early.

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:20.380
It's just how it goes.

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:23.320
How are the Linux Fest Northwest plans shaping up?

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:27.620
Oh, you know, I think I may have secured some cat care.

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:30.240
That's number one on the list.

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.520
And then flights are coming in.

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.000
There's a sale going on.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.080
So, you know, all these things are starting to line up.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:40.800
There's a lot of moving parts because I got that gig at the same time as some of you know.

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:46.640
So lots and lots of moving parts, including trying to store basically a car full of photography

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.440
gear in a city that I don't exist in.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:54.120
So I got to find someone in Toronto to fleet my gear with while the dynamics of the type

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.120
of thing of brand.

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.120
I don't know.

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.120
Is it lifestyle?

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.120
Is that the right way to put it?

01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:59.560
Because it makes it sound like it's something weird.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.920
But you know, just like I totally know where you're at.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:07.040
And I completely understand like there's just weird problems that like you don't solve a

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.240
hundred times in a row.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:11.360
So it's not like you just have a process like you have to figure it out from scratch to

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:12.360
solve that problem.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:13.360
Yeah.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:16.400
And the other thing is when you approach people with like potential solutions that you've

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:20.200
dreamt up for, you know, a week, they always look at you a little funny, like no one's

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:24.200
ever asked me to store, you know, the van full of stuff before.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.200
That is a lot.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.200
That's an odd request.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.200
Yeah.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:32.800
Speaking of flying, I am so damn jealous of Elle, I just about I just about can't even

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.800
right now.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:38.200
Elle, you want to tell people, you want to tell people what you did today, what you told

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.200
me today?

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.200
You want to share with the class?

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:45.360
That I booked a flight out of PAE, is that the acronym for it now?

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.360
Yeah, Painfield.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.840
To San Francisco for DockerCon.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:48.840
Nice.

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:49.840
Oh, yeah, it's great.

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:50.840
It's great.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:51.840
Good job.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.280
I don't know how I don't know where she gets off because I'm telling you, I I've lived

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.080
here my whole life.

01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:00.960
And finally, they open up a new airport where I don't have to go all the way down to SeaTac

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.680
and now we're drive through the worst part of of traffic.

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:08.720
It finally opens up after all these after all this flying I've been doing all of this

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.080
driving back and forth to SeaTac.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.080
You know.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.080
Oh, yeah.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:13.080
You know.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.080
Oh, man.

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.080
You've suffered.

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.560
She beats to do it.

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.120
She just always does that kind of stuff.

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.120
She's like always leveling.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.120
She's like leveling up.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.480
She's like, yeah, yeah, I'm going to give three talks.

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:22.480
Like what?

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.480
I'm giving one talk.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:26.200
You know, I'm going to fly into I'm going to fly out of Painfield.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.200
What?

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.200
That's awesome.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:29.200
Yeah, it's great.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.120
I mean, y'all could come with me.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.040
I might actually maybe I'll be your ride.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:36.120
Maybe I'll give you a ride to the airport and then I can check out the airport.

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:39.440
Would they let me get I just get a walk around like I don't have to go through security.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:40.440
I just want to see it.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:41.440
Yeah.

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:44.680
Like I want to scope out the parking situation so I know next time I travel what it is.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.080
It's a whole other workflow.

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:50.160
And I want to know like how far how long is it from my five to the actual airport?

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.640
I have no idea.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:52.640
Yeah.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:56.320
It's it's it's a there's a lot I can use my new official Raspberry Pi keyboard to help

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.320
me find out.

01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:58.320
Look at you go.

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:21.480
Whoo.
