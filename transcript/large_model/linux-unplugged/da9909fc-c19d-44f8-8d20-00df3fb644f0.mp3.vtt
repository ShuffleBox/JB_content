WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Screw the iMac, LG has a 38-inch curved monitor.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.160
Oh, and by the way, it's also a PC with Ryzen

00:07.160 --> 00:09.400
and supports Ubuntu 16.04.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.040
How about that?

00:11.040 --> 00:11.940
How about that?

00:11.940 --> 00:13.480
It's the LG all-in-one.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.720
Ready for this catchy name, Wes?

00:14.720 --> 00:19.720
The LG 38CK900G-B.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.200
That rolls right off the tongue.

00:21.200 --> 00:25.320
Yeah, it comes with a Vega graphics,

00:25.320 --> 00:27.840
eight gigabytes of DDR4 RAM,

00:27.840 --> 00:31.380
the AMD Ryzen chip and a 128 gigabyte SSD,

00:31.380 --> 00:32.800
which is blank by default,

00:32.800 --> 00:35.280
but lists support for Ubuntu 16.04.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.120
Beautiful.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.520
Yeah, I wouldn't mind an ultra-wide IPS display

00:38.520 --> 00:43.120
with a 21.9 aspect ratio and a 3840 by 1600 resolution.

00:43.120 --> 00:45.800
The only downside, you gotta contact them for pricing

00:45.800 --> 00:47.920
because they're probably gonna wanna sell you about 5,000

00:47.920 --> 00:50.200
because these are all for professional deployments.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.960
Let's see if we can't find something

00:52.960 --> 00:54.160
a little more reasonably cheap.

00:54.160 --> 00:55.100
You're saying we're gonna outfit

00:55.100 --> 00:56.480
the whole JB crew with these?

00:56.480 --> 00:58.040
That's what you're saying?

00:58.040 --> 01:00.900
Right on, that's a great idea.

01:00.900 --> 01:03.640
That'll be our standard broadcast hardware.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.520
I actually think we could make a good business case

01:05.520 --> 01:06.340
for that.

01:06.340 --> 01:07.720
Yeah, absolutely.

01:07.720 --> 01:08.840
I would be more productive.

01:08.840 --> 01:11.160
I mean, I'm staring at two separate screens here.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.400
It's really killing it.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.560
Oh, you need an ultra-wide.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.640
You would be more productive.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.600
You might even be ultra more productive.

01:16.600 --> 01:17.440
Yeah, right?

01:17.440 --> 01:19.520
All those problems I have in my life, gone.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.600
Oh, Wes, if only it was that easy.

01:21.600 --> 01:26.600
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 251 for May 29th, 2018.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.160
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

01:40.160 --> 01:43.520
that's not so sure what that smell is, it's sniffin' around.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.360
My name is Chris.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.200
My name is Wes.

01:45.200 --> 01:48.760
Hello, Mr. Payne, we have such a fun show put together today.

01:48.760 --> 01:51.840
I'm glad we're able to get this connection working

01:51.840 --> 01:53.680
so that we can talk about great things,

01:53.680 --> 01:56.560
like a massive donation going to the Gnome Foundation,

01:56.560 --> 01:58.800
Thunderbolt networking coming to Linux,

01:58.800 --> 02:01.240
major distribution releases, and Mark Shuttleworth

02:01.240 --> 02:05.080
is turning up the heat on canonicals rhetoric about Red Hat.

02:05.080 --> 02:06.360
Plus, we've got a great app pick.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.880
We'll do a look back at Fedora 26,

02:08.880 --> 02:11.000
some new inbound open source stuffs,

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
or at least some stuffs you're gonna get

02:12.000 --> 02:14.880
on your Linux desktop, and then, perhaps,

02:14.880 --> 02:18.400
the conclusion to our quest for the best Linux.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.960
Best Linux laptop of 2018.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.600
I've been taking in your feedback.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.680
We put a vote out to the audience.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.280
We're looking at the numbers,

02:27.280 --> 02:29.360
and we're looking at the suggestions.

02:29.360 --> 02:30.840
At the end of this week's episode,

02:30.840 --> 02:33.080
one laptop will go off our list.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.600
We'll put another laptop on there

02:34.600 --> 02:36.120
if we can come to an agreement,

02:36.120 --> 02:38.540
and regardless of what laptop on our list

02:38.540 --> 02:40.000
you're thinking about getting,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.640
we'll wrap up with some tips for whichever one

02:42.640 --> 02:44.200
that are just great to keep in mind

02:44.200 --> 02:46.600
when you're trying to buy a system to run Linux.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.280
So we've got so many good things to get into.

02:48.280 --> 02:51.120
Plus, I'm on the road, tell you a little bit about why.

02:51.120 --> 02:54.640
I'm in this awkwardly painted and smelling place

02:54.640 --> 02:56.760
in Grants Pass, Oregon, on my way down to Texas.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.400
We'll tell you about what's going on with that,

02:58.400 --> 02:59.680
and all other kinds of goodies.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.980
It's a packed, packed episode.

03:01.980 --> 03:03.520
So let's not go any further

03:03.520 --> 03:05.540
without bringing in our mumble room.

03:05.540 --> 03:08.080
Time, appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.240
What's up?

03:09.240 --> 03:11.080
Hello. Hello.

03:11.080 --> 03:12.320
Hello, guys.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.220
I am glad to have all of you here this week

03:14.220 --> 03:16.720
because we have so many things to get into,

03:16.720 --> 03:20.600
and I thought let's start off with some good fricking news.

03:20.600 --> 03:24.480
Gnome is announcing a $1 million donation

03:24.480 --> 03:25.960
over the next two years.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.200
An anonymous donor,

03:27.200 --> 03:29.860
and I'd love to know who this anonymous person is,

03:29.860 --> 03:34.860
has donated a million dollars over the next two years,

03:34.920 --> 03:36.300
some of which will be matching funds

03:36.300 --> 03:37.720
with other folks' donations.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.340
That is huge, right?

03:39.340 --> 03:41.200
And say what you will about Gnome.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.320
We've had a lot of discussions about it recently,

03:43.320 --> 03:45.400
but they do great work.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.940
It's wonderful that we have this good open source project,

03:47.940 --> 03:48.880
but open source is hard.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.180
It takes a lot of effort,

03:50.180 --> 03:52.480
and yes, they have funding from Red Hat and other people,

03:52.480 --> 03:54.160
but a million bucks over two years,

03:54.160 --> 03:55.280
that's just a big commitment

03:55.280 --> 03:56.200
that things are gonna get better.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.600
People will continue doing that awesome hard work,

03:58.600 --> 04:00.440
and us freeloading community,

04:00.440 --> 04:01.640
we're gonna see the benefit.

04:01.640 --> 04:02.560
No kidding.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.880
That's what, $125,000 a quarter?

04:04.880 --> 04:06.060
That's probably how it'll get trickled

04:06.060 --> 04:06.980
into the foundation, too.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.080
Yeah, that's a good way to think about it,

04:08.080 --> 04:10.320
which is a serious amount of money.

04:10.320 --> 04:11.160
Either way, you crack it,

04:11.160 --> 04:14.200
even if it is over quarters or months or whatever.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.040
I like that.

04:15.040 --> 04:15.880
I read that story a lot.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.520
I've seen a lot of people talking about it,

04:17.520 --> 04:19.380
and it's not like big, big news,

04:19.380 --> 04:20.600
but I think it's still worth mentioning,

04:20.600 --> 04:22.360
and I wonder if maybe one day

04:22.360 --> 04:25.240
we'll get to figure out who it is.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.320
But moving on,

04:26.320 --> 04:28.840
let's talk about Thunderbolt networking on Linux.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.240
So Thunderbolt, like the spec,

04:30.240 --> 04:32.560
allows for peer-to-peer networking

04:32.560 --> 04:36.700
with really relative simplicity on Mac OS and Windows.

04:36.700 --> 04:38.080
You plug two machines into each other

04:38.080 --> 04:40.000
over the Thunderbolt connection, and it just works.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.020
That has technically been possible on Linux via the kernel,

04:44.020 --> 04:46.120
but there really hasn't been anything in user space

04:46.120 --> 04:48.160
to facilitate the networking.

04:48.160 --> 04:49.440
And that's changed now,

04:49.440 --> 04:52.400
thanks to Christian Kellner and Thomas Holler

04:52.400 --> 04:53.760
from Network Manager.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.640
And they're working together to figure out

04:55.640 --> 04:57.560
what in user space needed to get done

04:57.560 --> 04:59.800
to make Thunderbolt peer-to-peer networking work.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.640
Think about this.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.140
You have the massive, fast,

05:02.140 --> 05:04.900
PCI-bust-to-PCI-bust Thunderbolt interface,

05:04.900 --> 05:07.040
and you could run networking over that.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.640
And if you now connect,

05:08.640 --> 05:11.200
if you have modern Network Manager

05:11.200 --> 05:13.640
and modern-ish Linux kernel,

05:13.640 --> 05:15.260
it hasn't been in there for like a super long time,

05:15.260 --> 05:17.120
but if you have a kind of a recent one, you're good.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.400
You match those two things up,

05:19.400 --> 05:20.780
and all you have to do after that

05:20.780 --> 05:23.040
is plug a Thunderbolt cable into one end and another end,

05:23.040 --> 05:25.040
and they detect the presence,

05:25.040 --> 05:26.160
and they set up the networking.

05:26.160 --> 05:29.240
The way it works is when you plug in a Thunderbolt device,

05:29.240 --> 05:33.520
it actually creates a little device name

05:33.520 --> 05:35.320
on your file system in sysfs.

05:35.320 --> 05:36.400
It creates a little device.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.680
And there's some certain attributes

05:37.680 --> 05:38.600
if it supports networking.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.160
And now what's technically happening here

05:41.160 --> 05:45.440
is a Udev rule and Network Manager are working together.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.760
When they see a Thunderbolt device

05:46.760 --> 05:48.480
that has that networking attribute,

05:48.480 --> 05:51.040
they can, you can now, you can option to set them up,

05:51.040 --> 05:53.360
and within a couple of seconds,

05:53.360 --> 05:56.080
you now have a local network running over Thunderbolt.

05:56.080 --> 05:59.160
That is just so cool, super handy.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.000
I think of so many times where you have to like

06:01.000 --> 06:02.320
figure out a crossover cable,

06:02.320 --> 06:03.400
and then you probably have to understand

06:03.400 --> 06:04.720
how networking works to make this work.

06:04.720 --> 06:08.060
So if a layperson can use that, that is totally slick.

06:08.060 --> 06:10.040
I'm also curious,

06:10.040 --> 06:11.560
I wonder if you could pixie boot off this,

06:11.560 --> 06:13.660
because then you could have like a Docker container

06:13.660 --> 06:15.320
or just a little script on your setup

06:15.320 --> 06:18.040
to have a TFTP pixie boot server running,

06:18.040 --> 06:20.320
plug in a Thunderbolt cable between two computers

06:20.320 --> 06:23.120
and away you go, no more USB drives.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.520
That's a great idea.

06:24.520 --> 06:26.240
That is a really clever idea,

06:26.240 --> 06:28.820
like a great rescue system, like a laptop.

06:28.820 --> 06:31.720
If you had machines you were saving that had Thunderbolt

06:31.720 --> 06:32.960
and you had a laptop with Thunderbolt,

06:32.960 --> 06:35.240
you could just blow them away and reload them

06:35.240 --> 06:37.040
using network boot over Thunderbolt.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.320
That's a cool idea, Wes.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.900
Yeah, the other nice part here is that

06:39.900 --> 06:41.200
they link to the Udev rules,

06:41.200 --> 06:43.880
so if you're like me and you don't often use network manager,

06:43.880 --> 06:46.200
you can just load this thing yourself and get it working.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.780
Ah, yes, yes, that is really nice too.

06:48.780 --> 06:52.360
Yeah, I could definitely appreciate that right now.

06:52.360 --> 06:55.200
I have two laptops that are right next

06:55.200 --> 06:56.160
to each other physically,

06:56.160 --> 06:57.480
but they cannot talk to each other

06:57.480 --> 07:00.440
because the wifi here is just a mess,

07:00.440 --> 07:01.600
and where I'm at right now,

07:01.600 --> 07:02.600
I'll tell you more about that in a minute,

07:02.600 --> 07:04.840
but where I'm at right now is just,

07:04.840 --> 07:06.240
it's devastating for networking,

07:06.240 --> 07:08.960
and if I could just take one cable

07:08.960 --> 07:10.360
and hook these two machines up,

07:10.360 --> 07:12.660
and neither one of them have an ethernet port either.

07:12.660 --> 07:15.280
Ironically, they have USB-C,

07:15.280 --> 07:17.800
but they do not have an ethernet port.

07:17.800 --> 07:22.140
So, oh, that's the world we live in now.

07:22.140 --> 07:24.720
All right, well, we have different segments

07:24.720 --> 07:25.560
of the show today.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.240
I'm trying out a few different format options

07:27.240 --> 07:28.080
while I'm on the road,

07:28.080 --> 07:30.320
and I thought some category names

07:30.320 --> 07:31.580
might help me put my head around

07:31.580 --> 07:32.420
what we're gonna talk about.

07:32.420 --> 07:36.280
So this next one is making ourselves at GNOME,

07:36.280 --> 07:40.760
and this is Endless, and Endless 3.4.0 has come out.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.280
Now, you may recall we had a chat

07:43.280 --> 07:45.360
with Michael Hall a while ago.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.200
He's now working at Endless,

07:47.200 --> 07:51.520
and he wrote a post on their community.endless.os page

07:51.520 --> 07:54.160
about the new Endless 3.4,

07:54.160 --> 07:56.240
and they say there's lots of exciting features,

07:56.240 --> 07:58.620
but some of them that are jumping out at me right now

07:58.620 --> 08:01.320
is options to manage your data consumption

08:01.320 --> 08:02.780
in really smart ways.

08:02.780 --> 08:05.040
Now, you'll recall Endless has been really built

08:05.040 --> 08:09.120
as an OS that is really graceful at handling

08:09.120 --> 08:10.340
when you have no connectivity.

08:10.340 --> 08:13.000
They have local Wikipedia articles and stuff like that.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.480
It gracefully switches between online and offline,

08:15.480 --> 08:17.560
and they're just doubling down on that,

08:17.560 --> 08:19.280
and I think this is really cool,

08:19.280 --> 08:20.800
and one of the ways that they're doubling down

08:20.800 --> 08:22.720
on this offline stuff,

08:22.720 --> 08:24.400
and you're gonna think this is weird at first,

08:24.400 --> 08:25.560
but stick with me here.

08:26.680 --> 08:31.160
They're introducing an Android companion app for Endless OS,

08:31.160 --> 08:32.760
and I'm gonna tell you more about that here in a moment,

08:32.760 --> 08:35.280
but before we go off in too many different directions,

08:35.280 --> 08:38.040
let's focus on the data consumption stuff.

08:38.040 --> 08:40.080
You can now mark in Endless 3.4,

08:40.080 --> 08:42.540
which is based on GNOME and GTK stuff,

08:42.540 --> 08:43.980
you can now mark your connection

08:43.980 --> 08:46.720
as having a limited or unlimited data,

08:46.720 --> 08:49.980
and then that tells the operating system

08:49.980 --> 08:52.320
to enable automatic updates,

08:52.320 --> 08:55.780
to wait until you have good, convenient wireless,

08:55.780 --> 08:56.720
or whatever you might have.

08:56.720 --> 09:00.560
You can now use a little bit of intelligence there

09:00.560 --> 09:02.800
between it's trying to detect how much bandwidth you have,

09:02.800 --> 09:04.960
and you being able to now implicitly tell it

09:04.960 --> 09:06.560
to not use too much bandwidth,

09:06.560 --> 09:08.640
is you can just totally turn off automatic updates

09:08.640 --> 09:09.520
in those situations,

09:09.520 --> 09:11.600
and they're combining that with schedules,

09:11.600 --> 09:12.800
so you can now also say,

09:12.800 --> 09:15.440
with all exceptions except for these days and these hours,

09:15.440 --> 09:16.900
just turn off automatic updates.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.140
Don't even do an apt update.

09:19.140 --> 09:20.480
Don't even do an apt update.

09:20.480 --> 09:21.320
Wow.

09:21.320 --> 09:22.440
And now you can just go in there,

09:22.440 --> 09:24.980
and there is a GNOME settings dialog

09:24.980 --> 09:27.380
that exposes all of that.

09:27.380 --> 09:28.440
That's kinda nice,

09:28.440 --> 09:30.720
and I could definitely see a use case for that

09:30.720 --> 09:33.180
outside the US and outside places

09:33.180 --> 09:35.640
that have pretty generally good connectivity.

09:35.640 --> 09:39.480
I kid you not, the town I am in today has no internet.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.520
The whole town has no internet where I'm at today.

09:42.520 --> 09:43.800
So don't do any updates.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.920
No, I should definitely not.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.480
And so I could kinda,

09:48.480 --> 09:51.520
you can really, even in the quote unquote west,

09:51.520 --> 09:53.240
you can appreciate features like this,

09:53.240 --> 09:55.040
but let's talk about that companion app for a second,

09:55.040 --> 09:57.040
because that's probably what piqued your interest.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.680
This is an interesting idea from Endless,

09:59.680 --> 10:01.160
and it's an app that's going to allow you

10:01.160 --> 10:05.120
to view content from your computer on any Android device.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.400
Now remember, the Endless OS has a whole bunch

10:08.400 --> 10:11.400
of native apps that they've created with offline data,

10:11.400 --> 10:14.240
and they say while the Endless companion app itself

10:14.240 --> 10:15.760
is not publicly available,

10:15.760 --> 10:17.320
all of the support for this app

10:17.320 --> 10:20.020
has been built into Endless 3.4 that is available.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.200
The companion app was created because we found

10:22.200 --> 10:25.280
that many of our users have a single Endless computer

10:25.280 --> 10:27.320
in a household with multiple people

10:27.320 --> 10:30.240
trying to access the information at the same time.

10:30.240 --> 10:32.040
With the Endless companion app,

10:32.040 --> 10:33.840
everyone will be able to access the information

10:33.840 --> 10:36.680
found on their computers with any compatible phone

10:36.680 --> 10:39.200
or tablet without using any internet connection

10:39.200 --> 10:41.640
or data connection, so it's all gonna be over the LAN.

10:41.640 --> 10:42.480
Oh really?

10:42.480 --> 10:43.980
Yeah, that's kinda neat, right?

10:43.980 --> 10:46.280
That's a great, great idea.

10:46.280 --> 10:47.120
Smart.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.280
Especially in countries where perhaps

10:49.280 --> 10:51.320
internet connectivity is very, very limited,

10:51.320 --> 10:54.120
like apparently Oregon, which is now a country.

10:54.120 --> 10:58.160
Endless 3.4 is also upgrading to GNOME 3.26,

10:58.160 --> 11:00.920
and it will ship with Linux kernel 4.15,

11:00.920 --> 11:02.280
which brings the support up

11:02.280 --> 11:04.080
for a whole bunch of new hardware,

11:04.080 --> 11:05.240
and then they've also updated

11:05.240 --> 11:06.680
some of their own Endless apps,

11:06.680 --> 11:08.400
and they've also made the decision

11:08.400 --> 11:11.580
to include Adblock directly in with Endless,

11:11.580 --> 11:13.580
so when you, it's just pre-installed.

11:13.580 --> 11:16.180
Adblock is just pre-installed with Endless.

11:16.180 --> 11:17.680
That's a lot I just laid on you, Wes,

11:17.680 --> 11:21.680
but Endless is sort of reminding me,

11:21.680 --> 11:22.920
and I don't know if you recall,

11:22.920 --> 11:25.280
but there was a distribution called Xandros

11:25.280 --> 11:27.720
back in the day, and I hope they don't mind this comparison.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.400
Xandros spoke in a way that is familiar

11:30.400 --> 11:32.160
when you read Endless, like for example,

11:32.160 --> 11:34.040
Michael writes, and Michael Hall

11:34.040 --> 11:36.200
is fully technically competent, so.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.040
Absolutely.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.360
They're writing this in a way

11:38.360 --> 11:41.480
that is very, very targeted,

11:41.480 --> 11:43.120
like they talk about how they've updated

11:43.120 --> 11:44.640
their open source core,

11:44.640 --> 11:45.560
and they're not necessarily talking about

11:45.560 --> 11:47.480
how they've updated glibc,

11:47.480 --> 11:50.320
or they're on the latest version of ButterFS programs,

11:50.320 --> 11:52.400
they're talking about the open source core,

11:52.400 --> 11:53.840
like it's more generic,

11:53.840 --> 11:56.220
it's more about a whole inclusive operating system.

11:56.220 --> 11:58.400
And it's just what you need to know.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.680
It's none of the extra details.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.200
Yeah, do you think that's a fair comparison?

12:02.200 --> 12:03.480
Oh yeah, definitely.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.320
I'm just impressed with the focus here,

12:05.320 --> 12:09.800
you know, they have some consistent design vision,

12:09.800 --> 12:11.460
and some of these features are things

12:11.460 --> 12:13.060
that you see in competitors,

12:13.060 --> 12:16.060
or you see in other operating systems

12:16.060 --> 12:18.480
that span the mobile desktop world,

12:18.480 --> 12:20.460
and you have expectations from mobile

12:20.460 --> 12:21.640
of how you can manage a device,

12:21.640 --> 12:23.600
especially for lay users,

12:23.600 --> 12:25.160
and they're kind of taking it to the next level

12:25.160 --> 12:26.440
that you don't have in a lot

12:26.440 --> 12:28.440
of other common Linux desktop environments.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.200
That companion app is a really interesting strategy, huh?

12:31.200 --> 12:32.560
Oh yeah, absolutely.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.120
I mean, it works on the land,

12:34.120 --> 12:35.280
you can just manage it,

12:35.280 --> 12:37.840
if you're kind of the smart one in your house,

12:37.840 --> 12:39.240
or you can teach people to use it,

12:39.240 --> 12:41.640
then boom, super useful.

12:41.640 --> 12:44.360
Anyways, check out EndlessOS if you're interested.

12:44.360 --> 12:47.520
I don't feel like it has a strong draw to our audience,

12:47.520 --> 12:49.360
but I do really like what they're doing over there,

12:49.360 --> 12:51.160
and I really respect that they're trying to build an OS

12:51.160 --> 12:54.720
that is still very useful without internet connectivity,

12:54.720 --> 12:58.160
because I do find like, it's kind of pathetic

12:58.160 --> 13:01.420
when I sit down with my laptop and I have no connectivity,

13:01.420 --> 13:04.360
I don't really have anything to do on my laptop.

13:04.360 --> 13:07.880
Like there's not like a lot to do locally,

13:07.880 --> 13:10.900
and I feel like, and this seems obvious on its face,

13:10.900 --> 13:12.300
but I still think it's worth mentioning,

13:12.300 --> 13:16.040
I feel like 20 years ago, that wasn't the case.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.880
Like I would go online a little bit and do stuff,

13:18.880 --> 13:20.680
but the most of the stuff that I did,

13:20.680 --> 13:22.120
I did locally on my computer.

13:22.120 --> 13:24.400
But now thinking back, I don't even remember

13:24.400 --> 13:26.220
what I was doing, because it wasn't games.

13:26.220 --> 13:27.400
I mean, it was sometimes games,

13:27.400 --> 13:30.600
but I always did stuff locally.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.720
I mean, maybe you just, you need some DOS locally,

13:32.720 --> 13:34.720
you can fire that up when you don't have internet connection

13:34.720 --> 13:36.440
and you'll figure it out what you were doing.

13:36.440 --> 13:40.560
Yeah, just get back in the zone, huh?

13:40.560 --> 13:44.240
So I kind of like the idea of taking these computers

13:44.240 --> 13:46.780
and making them a little bit more valuable

13:46.780 --> 13:48.800
without connectivity, because they're so powerful

13:48.800 --> 13:50.120
and they're so expensive.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.400
It's kind of pathetic that they're so worthless

13:52.400 --> 13:53.960
without an internet connection.

13:54.840 --> 13:59.840
And you know, it's sort of the anti-Chromebook in a way,

13:59.920 --> 14:01.720
and I also appreciate that.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.820
All right, well, let's keep moving on,

14:03.820 --> 14:06.020
and I gotta tell you about my internet connectivity

14:06.020 --> 14:06.860
situation today.

14:06.860 --> 14:09.540
It is, I've never had a situation like this

14:09.540 --> 14:13.220
in my entire life where the town loses internet,

14:13.220 --> 14:17.400
and it's slowly coming back, but it is so awful.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.360
And so I'll tell you all about it.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.860
And let's start by clearing the decks

14:20.860 --> 14:23.520
and thanking Linux Academy for making this show possible.

14:23.520 --> 14:26.260
As I am watching someone almost get in an accident right now

14:26.260 --> 14:28.000
as they pull out onto the road,

14:28.000 --> 14:31.640
I can't even tell you about the late nights

14:31.640 --> 14:35.440
after I worked hours and hours at my job,

14:35.440 --> 14:37.840
I would then get in my car and I would drive down

14:37.840 --> 14:41.240
to the community college so I could take my Linux courses.

14:41.240 --> 14:43.000
Wow, have things changed.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.200
Now I can do it from the comfort of my laptop,

14:45.200 --> 14:47.720
from the comfort of my desk, or the comfort of my home.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.600
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.360
You don't have to be like this Subaru driver

14:52.360 --> 14:55.220
who almost just got in an accident right outside my window.

14:55.220 --> 14:56.680
So that way they can go out and get something done.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.000
You can take advantage of it

14:58.000 --> 14:59.700
using something called the internet.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.340
I know it's new.

15:01.340 --> 15:02.720
You're gonna have to get an account,

15:02.720 --> 15:04.640
but I think it's worth dialing up to and trying out.

15:04.640 --> 15:07.880
The information superhighway is gonna be game changing,

15:07.880 --> 15:09.880
and these companies are gonna be able to put things online

15:09.880 --> 15:12.360
where you can just tap in and get the knowledge directly.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.960
And, oh wait, oh wait, that's already happened,

15:14.960 --> 15:15.960
and it's Linux Academy.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.400
Go try it out at LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.700
You can sign up for a free seven day trial.

15:20.700 --> 15:21.540
Kick the tires.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.200
They got hands on scenario based labs

15:23.200 --> 15:25.320
to give you real experience.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.400
I say that with emphasis because that means

15:27.400 --> 15:29.320
after you're done at Linux Academy,

15:29.320 --> 15:30.880
you can go do it in production,

15:30.880 --> 15:32.600
and you're not gonna be all anxious and nervous

15:32.600 --> 15:34.160
that you've never done this before.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.100
You can speak with authority on a topic

15:36.100 --> 15:37.280
because you'll have done it.

15:37.280 --> 15:40.100
You pick the courseware, you set the distribution,

15:40.100 --> 15:41.880
the servers that spin up match that.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.040
They got human instructors,

15:43.040 --> 15:44.640
whatever you get stuck, you need help,

15:44.640 --> 15:45.860
they're there for you, they're there.

15:45.860 --> 15:47.000
If they're not there helping you,

15:47.000 --> 15:48.920
they're helping other people, they're updating content,

15:48.920 --> 15:51.620
they're making sure your subscription stays valuable.

15:51.620 --> 15:54.020
So go to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged,

15:54.020 --> 15:55.800
the number one resource online

15:55.800 --> 15:58.480
for people to learn more about anything that runs Linux

15:58.480 --> 16:00.480
or anything that Linux runs on top of.

16:00.480 --> 16:04.380
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged, free seven day trial.

16:05.400 --> 16:08.200
Yeah, so I'm on my way down to Austin, Texas.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.360
I'm going down there, actually to see Linux Academy,

16:10.360 --> 16:13.200
they're in Keller, but I'm going down there

16:13.200 --> 16:15.040
the week after Linux Fest Northwest,

16:15.040 --> 16:17.280
or Linux Fest Texas.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.880
I'm going to Linux Academy, so speaking of Linux Academy.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.680
But right now, I'm on my way down to Austin

16:21.680 --> 16:23.720
and I've stopped in Grants Pass, Oregon.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.820
And that's where everything went wrong.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.320
It's been a really hard day.

16:31.160 --> 16:33.480
And I'm actually, in a way, I'm really relieved

16:33.480 --> 16:35.720
to be here chatting with you guys

16:35.720 --> 16:38.160
because today has been, you know, it's like,

16:38.160 --> 16:39.600
you know what I mean, like when you've gone through

16:39.600 --> 16:41.160
like something and then like you're going back

16:41.160 --> 16:43.360
to a little bit of routine, how it just feels right.

16:43.360 --> 16:44.200
You know that feeling?

16:44.200 --> 16:45.720
Comforting comforts of home.

16:45.720 --> 16:46.920
Yeah, exactly.

16:46.920 --> 16:50.000
Yeah, so we left early Monday after,

16:50.840 --> 16:54.660
so it turns out, Wes, Levi is allergic to bees

16:54.660 --> 16:56.440
in a really, really bad way.

16:56.440 --> 16:59.440
No, oh Levi, poor buddy.

16:59.440 --> 17:03.500
Yeah, he got stung on just like, you know,

17:03.500 --> 17:05.420
we just went to a park, went for a walk,

17:05.420 --> 17:07.600
and he got stung by a bee.

17:07.600 --> 17:11.460
And no big deal, it started with some really bad swelling

17:11.460 --> 17:15.000
around his eyes and then it turned into like mumps

17:15.000 --> 17:17.440
all over his face, like his face got all bumpy

17:17.440 --> 17:21.400
and old and weird looking and his ears started itching

17:21.400 --> 17:24.280
and then, you know, by then we were already hot on it.

17:24.280 --> 17:25.480
We knew something was wrong by then

17:25.480 --> 17:27.080
and we'd already give him a Benadryl.

17:27.080 --> 17:30.320
And then it spreaded to the rest of his body

17:30.320 --> 17:33.080
and he got hives, these big red hives,

17:33.080 --> 17:35.840
and his hair looked all mangy and gross everywhere

17:35.840 --> 17:37.040
and he was out of it.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.360
He was a different dog, it was weird.

17:39.360 --> 17:43.160
And we had to take him into the emergency doggy ER

17:43.160 --> 17:45.760
and they gave him like an epi shot,

17:45.760 --> 17:50.120
they gave him a steroid, and they gave him more Benadryl.

17:50.120 --> 17:53.280
And so he has been in full recovery for three days.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.680
It's been, he has been a totally different dog.

17:55.680 --> 17:56.720
It's been really weird because, you know,

17:56.720 --> 18:01.720
he's this happy-go-lucky, smart, clever, curious dog.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.040
He's always spunky and wanting to have fun.

18:04.040 --> 18:08.240
Yeah, and he's just been totally like slow and mopey

18:08.240 --> 18:10.760
and sad and he doesn't want to jump up on anything

18:10.760 --> 18:11.960
and his skin hurts.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.320
And so today he's finally been getting better,

18:14.320 --> 18:17.280
but we got a little bit of a late start.

18:17.280 --> 18:20.960
And so we drove hard yesterday for eight hours

18:20.960 --> 18:22.960
and ended up in Grant's Pass,

18:22.960 --> 18:25.740
which is our first planned stop on the route

18:25.740 --> 18:27.380
to get some work done on Lady Jupes

18:27.380 --> 18:29.440
to get the suspensions upgraded,

18:29.440 --> 18:32.000
put in some sway bars and put in some Sumo shocks

18:32.000 --> 18:33.320
and all these things that we,

18:33.320 --> 18:35.640
they have Kony shocks and Sumo springs

18:35.640 --> 18:37.240
and all these things that they're putting in there.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.640
It's really funny, the names.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.960
You gotta be robust if you're venturing across the country.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.840
Yeah, you know, you do, you're right, exactly.

18:42.840 --> 18:46.960
And he took me under, they park it up on this,

18:46.960 --> 18:48.840
you know, like this whole rig

18:48.840 --> 18:50.960
and then they've got like this trench underneath it.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.320
And so the guy's name was Eric.

18:53.320 --> 18:55.940
He took me underneath and Eric showed me

18:55.940 --> 18:58.200
like all the different stuff and it was just really,

18:58.200 --> 19:00.240
it was a really cool experience.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.060
And then they're like, you know,

19:01.060 --> 19:04.240
and we also have a rental car that you guys can use

19:04.240 --> 19:06.420
for the day.

19:06.420 --> 19:07.860
And you know, you can drive around town.

19:07.860 --> 19:08.980
We're like, well, this is great

19:08.980 --> 19:10.820
cause I have to get to a motel room

19:10.820 --> 19:12.400
where I'm gonna be recording my show

19:12.400 --> 19:14.180
because I'm not gonna be able to record in the RV

19:14.180 --> 19:15.940
cause they're banging on the frame.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.260
So we get in the car and they're like,

19:19.260 --> 19:21.900
oh, before you go, we have this waiting room.

19:21.900 --> 19:22.980
Do you wanna, you know, if you have to do it,

19:22.980 --> 19:24.100
cause I mentioned, you know,

19:24.100 --> 19:26.240
I needed to get some connectivity.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.180
We have a waiting room with wifi.

19:28.180 --> 19:29.300
Would you like to just check that out?

19:29.300 --> 19:30.860
I'll go over there and do a speed check.

19:30.860 --> 19:32.860
So I get in there and I'm talking to people like,

19:32.860 --> 19:35.100
yeah, no, the wifi doesn't seem to be working.

19:35.100 --> 19:38.420
Like, oh, go figure, right?

19:39.420 --> 19:43.480
And so we leave, come over to the motel.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.020
The motel's like, yeah,

19:45.020 --> 19:46.540
hey, we're having internet problems there.

19:46.540 --> 19:48.300
Our wifi isn't working.

19:48.300 --> 19:50.620
And I'm like, oh, okay, all right.

19:50.620 --> 19:55.460
Well, tell you what, I'm gonna go drive around

19:55.460 --> 19:56.820
for a little bit and I'll be back.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.180
We'll see about the internet problem.

19:58.180 --> 20:01.740
And so I go over to La Quinta and to a holiday express,

20:01.740 --> 20:03.420
all these different like hotels.

20:03.420 --> 20:04.900
No, everybody's, internet's down today.

20:04.900 --> 20:07.240
And the internet's not working today.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.880
So I'm at the last hotel that I was gonna try

20:10.880 --> 20:12.740
and I'm in the lobby and there's a guy

20:12.740 --> 20:14.240
who clearly looks like an IT guy

20:14.240 --> 20:15.640
because he looks just like I do.

20:15.640 --> 20:20.640
And so I'm like, and I got a Coder radio shirt on, you know?

20:20.740 --> 20:22.860
And so he's like, oh yeah, no, no,

20:22.860 --> 20:24.060
the internet's out in the town today.

20:24.060 --> 20:25.080
I'm like, what?

20:25.080 --> 20:27.240
Yeah, no, there's no internet here in the town today.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.740
I'm like, what do you mean there's no internet

20:28.740 --> 20:30.060
in the town today?

20:30.060 --> 20:31.680
Cause like, this is all hitting me at once.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.980
He's like, yeah, I don't know, there's something going on

20:33.980 --> 20:36.940
and our provider has an outage and I'm like, provider?

20:36.940 --> 20:37.980
Singular?

20:37.980 --> 20:38.820
Like, what?

20:38.820 --> 20:40.180
You have one provider?

20:40.180 --> 20:41.300
No!

20:41.300 --> 20:43.320
And yeah, yeah, no, internet's out.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.140
I'm like, oh God, okay, well,

20:45.140 --> 20:46.420
I guess I'll have to use my phone.

20:46.420 --> 20:48.340
All right, you know, that's fine.

20:49.320 --> 20:52.380
So I come back to the original motel that I had booked

20:52.380 --> 20:53.940
and I go in there and I'm like, all right,

20:53.940 --> 20:54.820
yeah, I think we're gonna do it.

20:54.820 --> 20:55.660
Well, that's fine.

20:55.660 --> 20:57.440
Nobody's got wifi.

20:57.440 --> 20:58.280
She's like, okay, great.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.740
Well, Mr. Fisher, I would love to get you in your room,

21:00.740 --> 21:02.860
but we have lost the key to your room.

21:02.860 --> 21:04.100
No, that's not a thing.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.100
That cannot be a thing.

21:06.100 --> 21:06.940
Yeah.

21:06.940 --> 21:09.400
And this is a one o'clock, the show starts at two o'clock

21:09.400 --> 21:13.300
and I'm like, okay, well, I have a work thing

21:13.300 --> 21:15.700
and I kinda need to be in there by 1.30.

21:15.700 --> 21:16.860
Is that gonna be doable?

21:16.860 --> 21:17.860
So the gal looks around, she's like,

21:17.860 --> 21:18.700
you know what I'm gonna do?

21:18.700 --> 21:20.660
I'm gonna send my husband over to the hardware store

21:20.660 --> 21:22.660
and he's gonna go get a new key made right now

21:22.660 --> 21:23.780
for you, Mr. Fisher.

21:23.780 --> 21:25.260
So why don't you just hang tight

21:25.260 --> 21:27.820
and he'll go get that key made for you.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.120
So he runs over to the hardware store, the husband,

21:30.120 --> 21:32.020
and he gets the key made.

21:32.020 --> 21:33.060
And I'm like, all right,

21:33.060 --> 21:34.500
well, I'm gonna go get a bite to eat.

21:34.500 --> 21:35.720
Might as well go get some food.

21:35.720 --> 21:36.820
So I go get a bite to eat.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.900
I come back to the hotel, the story's almost over.

21:38.900 --> 21:42.220
I get back to the hotel and the husband's there

21:42.220 --> 21:44.940
and the lady that runs the place is gone.

21:44.940 --> 21:45.980
And I'm like, he's like, you know what?

21:45.980 --> 21:46.800
I can check you in,

21:46.800 --> 21:47.640
cause I know you got a work thing.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.540
I'm like, yeah, I do have a work thing.

21:48.540 --> 21:49.380
Thank you.

21:49.380 --> 21:50.220
He's like, here, I got the key made for you,

21:50.220 --> 21:51.460
which by the way, barely works.

21:51.460 --> 21:52.580
It doesn't fit well.

21:52.580 --> 21:53.420
He's like, okay, well,

21:53.420 --> 21:55.300
there's just a couple of things you need to know.

21:55.300 --> 21:56.820
We are pet friendly,

21:56.820 --> 22:00.340
but you cannot let your pet on any of the chairs.

22:00.340 --> 22:01.940
Do not let your pet on the bed

22:01.940 --> 22:03.860
and do not let your pet in the bathroom.

22:04.720 --> 22:05.620
Okay.

22:05.620 --> 22:06.460
All right.

22:06.460 --> 22:07.300
Okay.

22:07.300 --> 22:09.740
So that's a lot of policing of my dog.

22:09.740 --> 22:11.220
Also, no smoking.

22:11.220 --> 22:12.060
I'm like, okay, that's fine.

22:12.060 --> 22:13.020
I don't plan to smoke.

22:13.020 --> 22:13.860
It's not a big deal.

22:13.860 --> 22:15.660
He's like, no, really, you can't smoke.

22:15.660 --> 22:16.700
I'm like, that's fine.

22:16.700 --> 22:17.580
I don't smoke.

22:17.580 --> 22:18.580
That's fine.

22:18.580 --> 22:19.980
Well, but you know what I'm saying, right, man?

22:19.980 --> 22:21.060
And he takes like that,

22:21.060 --> 22:23.120
like holding a doobie hand gesture,

22:23.120 --> 22:25.880
you know, up to the lips and does that.

22:25.880 --> 22:27.220
I'm saying, no smoking.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.780
You know what I mean, man?

22:28.780 --> 22:30.260
And I'm like, yeah, I got you.

22:30.260 --> 22:31.460
No smoking.

22:31.460 --> 22:32.460
It's like, okay, I'm just saying.

22:32.460 --> 22:34.000
Wow.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.060
What, like, what?

22:36.060 --> 22:38.740
What do I, do I look like some big pothead?

22:38.740 --> 22:40.300
Like, do I, do I actually wear my hair

22:40.300 --> 22:41.460
in dreads or something?

22:43.820 --> 22:45.260
And I'm looking at him, I'm like,

22:45.260 --> 22:47.520
okay, can you let me in the room?

22:48.660 --> 22:49.540
That's all I could say,

22:49.540 --> 22:51.660
because my dog won't smoke any joints.

22:51.660 --> 22:52.700
I promise.

22:52.700 --> 22:54.620
I'll cut Levi off for a couple of hours.

22:54.620 --> 22:56.500
He's not feeling well anyways.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.140
So I get in the room, and sure enough,

22:59.140 --> 23:01.020
it's like, you know, two minutes

23:01.020 --> 23:02.020
until we're supposed to be live.

23:02.020 --> 23:03.440
I'm wiring everything together.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.940
Wi-Fi's just not working at all.

23:05.940 --> 23:08.280
And I get a text message from Hadia.

23:08.280 --> 23:09.420
I just got in a car accident.

23:09.420 --> 23:10.700
What?

23:10.700 --> 23:11.620
Is she okay?

23:11.620 --> 23:12.980
She's okay, she's okay.

23:12.980 --> 23:15.580
You know, she's, the place that's working on Lady Joob's

23:15.580 --> 23:16.900
let us borrow their car.

23:16.900 --> 23:19.140
They got like a little Dodge Neon.

23:19.140 --> 23:20.060
And she backed it.

23:20.060 --> 23:22.660
So the thing about Grants Pass,

23:22.660 --> 23:24.380
the whole town is a town of one ways.

23:24.380 --> 23:25.540
It's all one ways.

23:25.540 --> 23:27.300
It's all one ways except for the side streets.

23:27.300 --> 23:28.340
It's all one ways.

23:28.340 --> 23:30.820
And so she's pulling onto a one way,

23:30.820 --> 23:32.060
but she was pulling the wrong way

23:32.060 --> 23:33.640
because she didn't recognize that.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.460
And so some people started honking at her.

23:35.460 --> 23:37.820
She wasn't, it was like friendly honks.

23:37.820 --> 23:39.020
Not like, oh my God, you idiot.

23:39.020 --> 23:41.460
It was like, hey, better watch out.

23:41.460 --> 23:43.740
So she puts the car in reverse and backs up

23:43.740 --> 23:45.180
and backs up right into a pole.

23:45.180 --> 23:46.020
Oh!

23:47.700 --> 23:50.780
So I am five minutes from live time,

23:50.780 --> 23:54.900
and a girlfriend has backed the car into a pole

23:54.900 --> 23:56.580
and is now I'm dealing with that.

23:56.580 --> 23:58.740
And I got no internet connectivity.

23:58.740 --> 24:00.540
And I'm sitting here thinking to myself,

24:00.540 --> 24:02.380
why am I doing this?

24:02.380 --> 24:04.860
Like, I just want to do a show.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.740
I just want to record the show.

24:06.740 --> 24:09.220
And so finally I got the key from the guy.

24:09.220 --> 24:11.080
I get in the room, I get everything set up.

24:11.080 --> 24:14.060
I get the text message from Hadia about the car accident.

24:14.060 --> 24:15.180
Make sure that she's okay.

24:15.180 --> 24:17.060
Make sure that we're squared away

24:17.060 --> 24:19.620
with the place that's loaning us the car.

24:19.620 --> 24:24.620
And now as I go live, the wifi is working here just enough

24:25.900 --> 24:27.360
for us to have this conversation

24:27.360 --> 24:29.660
because I've only got two bars of signal.

24:29.660 --> 24:32.300
So I've got one machine on the phone

24:32.300 --> 24:35.640
and I've got one machine on the wifi

24:35.640 --> 24:39.220
that's still dropping 3% of all of my packets.

24:39.220 --> 24:41.460
I mean, you can't be a perfectionist, Chris, come on.

24:41.460 --> 24:43.040
I know, I know.

24:43.040 --> 24:43.880
So there you go.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.380
That is my trip to Texas so far.

24:46.380 --> 24:48.100
I feel like there needs to be a central database

24:48.100 --> 24:50.740
of cell signal and all of those things.

24:50.740 --> 24:52.660
Like there needs to be one central repository

24:52.660 --> 24:55.240
of how all of that works.

24:55.240 --> 24:58.740
But anyways, the journey continues on.

24:58.740 --> 25:00.380
And now I'm in some weird motel room

25:00.380 --> 25:03.820
that smells really strange and is very, very yellow.

25:03.820 --> 25:05.060
Oh, hi there.

25:05.060 --> 25:07.780
And my lady friend just got back from her walk.

25:07.780 --> 25:10.200
And so we're stationed here in Grants Pass

25:10.200 --> 25:12.540
and while they work on the rig for one and a half days or so

25:12.540 --> 25:14.380
and then once the work completes,

25:14.380 --> 25:18.180
we'll continue on our trip.

25:18.180 --> 25:21.180
Anyways, if you want to hang out while we're in Texas,

25:21.180 --> 25:24.980
jupitabroadcasting.com.texas for the Meetup Telegram group.

25:24.980 --> 25:28.620
And then you can also get yourself a little swag

25:28.620 --> 25:32.500
at teespring.com.jbtexas is where you can get the swag at.

25:32.500 --> 25:33.740
Yeah, it is a good looking shirt.

25:33.740 --> 25:34.780
I'm very happy with it.

25:34.780 --> 25:38.660
And I love tux with a beard, teespring.com.jbtexas

25:38.660 --> 25:40.140
to get yourself that.

25:40.140 --> 25:42.460
All right, let's talk about Canonical and Ubuntu

25:42.460 --> 25:44.520
and Red Hat and OpenShift and OpenStack

25:44.520 --> 25:45.800
and all of those things,

25:45.800 --> 25:47.300
because that's what everybody else

25:47.300 --> 25:48.520
is talking about right now.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.460
So there was a summit just a bit ago,

25:50.460 --> 25:52.980
the OpenStack Cloud Summit or some shenanigans like that

25:52.980 --> 25:54.500
that I didn't make it down to.

25:54.500 --> 25:59.500
But your good buddy, Wes, Stephen J. Vanhoef-Nicholas,

25:59.580 --> 26:02.340
made it, and Stephen J., he went down

26:02.340 --> 26:05.580
and he noticed that there's been a tone change recently.

26:05.580 --> 26:07.740
And I'm not surprised if you think about it,

26:07.740 --> 26:09.420
Canonical's moving towards an IPO

26:09.420 --> 26:11.620
and so perhaps it's time for a tone change.

26:11.620 --> 26:14.500
Shuttleworth started out his keynote,

26:14.500 --> 26:16.620
sort of typical of a keynote.

26:16.620 --> 26:18.560
He said, our mission is to remove all friction

26:18.560 --> 26:20.060
from deploying OpenStack.

26:20.060 --> 26:22.540
We can deliver OpenStack deployments with two people

26:22.540 --> 26:25.220
in less than two weeks anywhere in the world.

26:25.220 --> 26:27.820
So, you know, a typical kind of opening to a keynote speech

26:27.820 --> 26:29.820
and kind of compelling, like, you know,

26:29.820 --> 26:30.820
really selling it there is like,

26:30.820 --> 26:32.620
we have a real advantage here.

26:32.620 --> 26:34.700
We're using upstream technology.

26:34.700 --> 26:36.700
It's super fast and easy to get it deployed

26:36.700 --> 26:38.700
and you can do it with less staff.

26:38.700 --> 26:39.660
People love hearing that.

26:39.660 --> 26:42.740
Yeah, but then things started to heat up a little bit.

26:42.740 --> 26:44.900
Then Amazon came into the conversation.

26:44.900 --> 26:46.860
And stick with me because I think this is,

26:46.860 --> 26:49.220
I think this is indicative of where Canonical is going

26:49.220 --> 26:52.300
and what they feel like their value is going to be.

26:52.300 --> 26:54.020
So he said, Mark Shuttleworth,

26:54.020 --> 26:55.820
Amazon has increased efficiency.

26:55.820 --> 26:58.860
So now everyone is driving down the cost of infrastructure.

26:58.860 --> 27:03.100
Everyone engages with Ubuntu, not Red Hat or VMware.

27:03.100 --> 27:06.940
Google, IBM, Microsoft are investing and innovating

27:06.940 --> 27:09.340
to drive down the cost of infrastructure.

27:09.340 --> 27:12.740
Every single one of those companies works with Canonical

27:12.740 --> 27:14.700
to deliver public services.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.660
Then Shuttleworth got down to brass tacks.

27:16.660 --> 27:20.580
And he said, not one of them engages with VMware

27:20.580 --> 27:22.260
to offer those public services.

27:22.260 --> 27:24.020
They can't afford to.

27:24.020 --> 27:25.860
Clearly they have the cash,

27:25.860 --> 27:29.460
but they don't have the complete on efficiencies.

27:29.460 --> 27:31.140
And so does your private cloud.

27:31.140 --> 27:34.260
So Canonical is rolling out a migration service

27:34.260 --> 27:37.060
to help users shift from VMware

27:37.060 --> 27:39.420
to a fully managed version

27:39.420 --> 27:42.220
of Canonical's Ubuntu OpenStack distribution.

27:42.220 --> 27:46.580
Customers want this because when they take out VMware,

27:46.580 --> 27:48.940
their Canonical is regularly told

27:48.940 --> 27:51.460
that our fully managed OpenStack solution

27:51.460 --> 27:55.180
costs half of the equivalent VMware service.

27:55.180 --> 27:56.140
Wow.

27:56.140 --> 27:58.020
Yeah, taking some shots at VMware in a big way,

27:58.020 --> 28:02.100
but things got even more interesting when Red Hat came up.

28:02.100 --> 28:05.060
When we're invited to bid and present head to head

28:05.060 --> 28:08.620
with Red Hat, we win four out of five times,

28:08.620 --> 28:12.340
including in companies that have never had any other Linux

28:12.340 --> 28:14.300
than Red Hat in the building.

28:14.300 --> 28:15.460
Four out of five times.

28:15.460 --> 28:18.740
He then goes on to add that Google, Microsoft, and IBM

28:18.740 --> 28:20.900
will be using and are using Ubuntu

28:20.900 --> 28:22.740
to underpin their Kubernetes offering

28:22.740 --> 28:25.900
because if you want to build on your OpenStack service

28:25.900 --> 28:29.460
for containers, it makes sense to use exactly the same stack.

28:29.460 --> 28:30.940
It's half the cost of VMware,

28:30.940 --> 28:32.580
a third of the cost of Red Hat,

28:32.580 --> 28:36.500
and it's a truly portable multi-cloud Kubernetes.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.540
And he's really touching on the difference here

28:38.540 --> 28:40.100
between what Canonical and Red Hat

28:40.100 --> 28:41.660
are offering for this space.

28:41.660 --> 28:45.060
Canonical is focusing on delivering inexpensive services

28:45.060 --> 28:48.140
and then offering support on upstream code,

28:48.140 --> 28:50.900
upstream OpenStack, and upstream Kubernetes,

28:50.900 --> 28:53.980
right, whereas Red Hat is offering branded OpenStack

28:53.980 --> 28:55.140
and branded Kubernetes.

28:55.140 --> 28:56.260
Do you agree, Wes?

28:56.260 --> 28:57.340
Oh yeah, no, absolutely.

28:57.340 --> 29:01.420
I mean, I can see some large enterprises

29:01.420 --> 29:02.940
where they still have that trust relationship,

29:02.940 --> 29:04.300
where they want those kinds of, you know,

29:04.300 --> 29:05.380
whatever additional features,

29:05.380 --> 29:07.780
but for people that are, yeah, in the commodity market,

29:07.780 --> 29:09.180
trying to be as efficient as possible,

29:09.180 --> 29:11.340
who are reselling, who are managing a cloud service

29:11.340 --> 29:12.820
for other people to use,

29:12.820 --> 29:13.900
you want something where, yes,

29:13.900 --> 29:16.380
you have support from Ubuntu, but it's all open source,

29:16.380 --> 29:18.660
it's all standard, everything you already know works,

29:18.660 --> 29:20.660
and if for some reason you need to shift

29:20.660 --> 29:22.940
or you no longer want to pay Ubuntu, okay,

29:22.940 --> 29:23.780
it's all open source,

29:23.780 --> 29:25.660
you've already built your experience with it.

29:25.660 --> 29:27.420
It's really a good value proposition.

29:27.420 --> 29:30.300
Yeah, yeah, and I like,

29:30.300 --> 29:31.940
I like just sort of dropping the pretense

29:31.940 --> 29:32.780
and just saying, look,

29:32.780 --> 29:36.300
Canonical is bringing you a more cost-effective solution.

29:36.300 --> 29:37.260
That's what we're trying to do.

29:37.260 --> 29:39.500
We're trying to compete on cost

29:39.500 --> 29:43.220
and we're trying to compete on upstream.

29:43.220 --> 29:46.460
We're trying to compete with not against upstream,

29:46.460 --> 29:47.700
but using upstream.

29:47.700 --> 29:49.620
Right, and then as upstream adds features,

29:49.620 --> 29:51.660
their offerings just get better and better.

29:51.660 --> 29:54.220
Right, and I think that's the opposite

29:54.220 --> 29:56.260
of how a lot of people in the consumer space

29:56.260 --> 29:57.700
would look at Red Hat and Canonical.

29:57.700 --> 29:58.660
They'd look at Red Hat,

29:58.660 --> 30:00.860
oh, Red Hat's gonna upstream, they'll upstream at all.

30:00.860 --> 30:02.380
They're using everything upstream.

30:02.380 --> 30:03.420
And Canonical's the one

30:03.420 --> 30:04.860
that has the not-invented-here syndrome.

30:04.860 --> 30:05.900
Have you ever heard of Unity?

30:05.900 --> 30:07.260
Oh my God, right?

30:07.260 --> 30:09.020
But in the reality, in the space

30:09.020 --> 30:10.700
where they're gonna try to make some money,

30:10.700 --> 30:12.700
where it's gonna really matter for the IPO,

30:12.700 --> 30:16.940
their strategy is to lean on upstream and then support that.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.740
I'm just saying as somebody who would be coming into this

30:19.740 --> 30:21.380
kind of with a fresh take,

30:21.380 --> 30:22.860
if I was gonna deploy something like this,

30:22.860 --> 30:24.420
that would be the approach I prefer.

30:24.420 --> 30:25.900
Do you think I'm missing something, Wes?

30:25.900 --> 30:28.420
I guess it's maybe the value that Red Hat's adding in there

30:28.420 --> 30:29.540
that I just don't appreciate?

30:29.540 --> 30:31.940
Yeah, I mean, they do have years of experience

30:31.940 --> 30:33.740
in this space providing enterprise support,

30:33.740 --> 30:35.940
providing customized solutions.

30:35.940 --> 30:38.780
So if you are like an older generation of company,

30:38.780 --> 30:41.620
if you have a lot of your own on-premises structure

30:41.620 --> 30:43.220
and you have special needs that are already invested

30:43.220 --> 30:44.540
in that ecosystem,

30:44.540 --> 30:45.900
or you just have a lot of cash to burn,

30:45.900 --> 30:47.700
then I think that could still make sense.

30:47.700 --> 30:48.900
I can still see people doing it.

30:48.900 --> 30:50.260
There's a lot of love for Red Hat.

30:50.260 --> 30:52.820
And their services, most of them are open source,

30:52.820 --> 30:53.860
they are good,

30:53.860 --> 30:56.540
but Ubuntu is just that lowest common denominator.

30:56.540 --> 30:57.700
All your developers,

30:57.700 --> 30:59.580
if they're already using Ubuntu,

30:59.580 --> 31:01.340
who spins up Red Hat containers to dev on?

31:01.340 --> 31:02.420
Maybe you're using Fedora.

31:02.420 --> 31:04.220
Ubuntu, it's all the same.

31:04.220 --> 31:05.260
You get the same experience

31:05.260 --> 31:07.780
and then you're just using OpenStack and Kubernetes?

31:07.780 --> 31:10.180
It seems like a winner.

31:10.180 --> 31:13.260
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if we see

31:13.260 --> 31:15.060
a more competitive talk like this,

31:15.060 --> 31:16.060
that might be the way to put it,

31:16.060 --> 31:20.260
is not aggressive or however else is being framed by ZDNet,

31:20.260 --> 31:24.100
but maybe just more delineation

31:24.100 --> 31:25.660
between this is what Red Hat offers

31:25.660 --> 31:27.020
and this is what Canonical offers.

31:27.020 --> 31:30.060
Because it seems to me that they have a job here to do.

31:30.060 --> 31:32.820
And Mark is the number one salesperson right now.

31:32.820 --> 31:34.180
The job is to IPO.

31:34.180 --> 31:35.540
The job is to go public.

31:35.540 --> 31:37.980
And the way you do that is by clearly differentiating

31:37.980 --> 31:41.060
what makes your company a valuable standout in the space

31:41.060 --> 31:42.620
versus the competition

31:42.620 --> 31:44.260
that could be using similar technology.

31:44.260 --> 31:46.740
And really the only way to do that

31:46.740 --> 31:48.580
is to message your differences.

31:48.580 --> 31:50.780
And how else are you gonna do that

31:50.780 --> 31:53.140
than by clearly saying we do this better than VMware

31:53.140 --> 31:54.580
and we do that better than Red Hat?

31:54.580 --> 31:56.620
Yeah, it feels like a good spirit.

31:56.620 --> 31:58.060
It's healthy competition.

31:58.060 --> 31:59.500
Hopefully everyone benefits.

31:59.500 --> 32:03.060
Now, let's talk about something bubbly and fun

32:03.060 --> 32:05.820
to sort of offset the big series enterprise stuff

32:05.820 --> 32:07.140
that we just talked about there.

32:07.140 --> 32:10.380
There was a wrap up of KDE Connect development sprint.

32:10.380 --> 32:12.020
And I think this is some good stuff here.

32:12.020 --> 32:16.580
It happened between March 23rd and the 25th of 2018.

32:16.580 --> 32:18.940
And they were working to get KDE Connect developers

32:18.940 --> 32:22.820
gathered in one spot in Barcelona to work for a weekend.

32:22.820 --> 32:27.380
And some good stuff was, as you might expect, developed.

32:27.380 --> 32:28.220
They kicked off the sprint

32:28.220 --> 32:30.180
by going through a backlog of ideas

32:30.180 --> 32:32.580
to decide what was worth implementing

32:32.580 --> 32:35.540
and then also focus on what bugs needed to get fixed.

32:35.540 --> 32:39.460
And one of the most requested features of KDE Connect

32:39.460 --> 32:43.380
was the ability to send SMS messages from the desktop.

32:44.220 --> 32:46.900
They already supported SMS to a certain degree

32:46.900 --> 32:50.180
with the ability to reply to most messages,

32:50.180 --> 32:52.540
but that wasn't quite enough.

32:52.540 --> 32:54.420
And some people even went as far

32:54.420 --> 32:56.620
as trying to roll their own solution in the meantime.

32:56.620 --> 32:59.260
But during the sprint, Simon and Alex started working

32:59.260 --> 33:01.220
on a fully featured interface

33:01.220 --> 33:04.260
for sending SMS easily from the desktop

33:04.260 --> 33:06.980
that includes full conversation views

33:06.980 --> 33:09.900
and the full contacts list support from your phone.

33:09.900 --> 33:12.140
They also worked on improving the functionality

33:12.140 --> 33:13.500
of the multimedia controls.

33:13.500 --> 33:16.100
So now it is possible to display the album art

33:16.100 --> 33:19.460
from your desktop on the Android device,

33:19.460 --> 33:22.620
both in the lock screen and in the multimedia notifications.

33:22.620 --> 33:24.900
And also, you know, less visible,

33:24.900 --> 33:28.060
but just crucial parts of what makes KDE Connect so useful

33:28.060 --> 33:29.820
is the integration with the system.

33:29.820 --> 33:32.540
And KDE Connect got some work on integrating

33:32.540 --> 33:35.380
with other systems like Nautilus.

33:35.380 --> 33:37.860
So people don't have to use Plasma or Dolphin

33:37.860 --> 33:40.900
to have all of the great features of KDE Connect.

33:41.940 --> 33:44.140
It just makes me so happy to hear this, Wes.

33:44.140 --> 33:46.220
Makes me honestly want to get an Android device.

33:46.220 --> 33:47.740
Have you thought about setting this up?

33:47.740 --> 33:50.100
Yes, actually, I think I might do that

33:50.100 --> 33:51.220
after this year episode.

33:51.220 --> 33:54.420
I've had KDE Connect running in the past

33:54.420 --> 33:55.940
on multiple machines,

33:55.940 --> 33:57.620
but it was always a little more awkward,

33:57.620 --> 33:59.020
especially like some of the stuff that was missing,

33:59.020 --> 33:59.980
like the Nautilus support.

33:59.980 --> 34:01.860
So this is really ramped up.

34:01.860 --> 34:04.340
I don't know if I care about all of these features,

34:04.340 --> 34:06.660
but better integration with Pulse Audio Control,

34:06.660 --> 34:07.500
the SMS stuff.

34:07.500 --> 34:08.820
I don't frequently send SMS,

34:08.820 --> 34:11.900
but when I do, I would much rather do it from my desktop.

34:11.900 --> 34:14.060
So this is huge usability wins.

34:14.060 --> 34:16.860
I'm excited to give it a try, even on my GNOME systems.

34:16.860 --> 34:18.380
What the hell's going on with KDE?

34:18.380 --> 34:19.740
What's going on with Plasma right now?

34:19.740 --> 34:21.180
Why is it getting so, what's going on?

34:21.180 --> 34:23.340
It's like everybody's talking about it these days.

34:23.340 --> 34:24.540
It's kicking butt.

34:24.540 --> 34:26.500
It's a renaissance.

34:26.500 --> 34:27.580
It's blown up.

34:27.580 --> 34:28.420
It's blown up.

34:29.340 --> 34:31.380
I just, I feel like we're talking these days

34:31.380 --> 34:32.500
about Qt all the time.

34:32.500 --> 34:33.700
We're talking about the Plasma desktop,

34:33.700 --> 34:35.540
and I don't think it's just because I've started using it.

34:35.540 --> 34:37.900
I think something's happening here.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.500
I feel like things are changing.

34:40.500 --> 34:42.700
How's your Kubuntu experience going so far, Popi?

34:42.700 --> 34:43.580
Or are you on Neon?

34:43.580 --> 34:44.660
I'm still on Neon.

34:44.660 --> 34:46.660
Now, I saw you tweeting or something the other day

34:46.660 --> 34:48.180
about some of the GNOME issue,

34:48.180 --> 34:53.060
but do you kind of use it on a regular basis, honestly?

34:53.060 --> 34:55.380
And do you agree that there seems to be more buzz

34:55.380 --> 34:57.940
these days about the whole Plasma stack?

34:57.940 --> 34:59.580
So in answer to your first question,

34:59.580 --> 35:00.460
yes, I use it all the time.

35:00.460 --> 35:03.460
I have two computers.

35:03.460 --> 35:04.300
Well, that's a lie.

35:04.300 --> 35:05.420
I have tons of computers,

35:05.420 --> 35:08.140
but two main ones that I'm sat at most of the time.

35:08.140 --> 35:11.420
So if I'm sat at my desk in the office,

35:11.420 --> 35:13.220
then I'm sat at GNOME Shell.

35:13.220 --> 35:14.140
It used to be Unity,

35:14.140 --> 35:18.220
and now I've switched to GNOME Shell on 1804.

35:18.220 --> 35:19.500
But as soon as I leave this room,

35:19.500 --> 35:21.820
I pick up my ThinkPad, which is running KDE Neon,

35:21.820 --> 35:24.980
the same one from the Distro Challenge months ago.

35:25.820 --> 35:26.660
And I use that.

35:26.660 --> 35:28.420
And if I go into the office in Canonical,

35:28.420 --> 35:30.580
there's no way I'm carrying this hulking great laptop.

35:30.580 --> 35:32.100
So I take my ThinkPad into the office.

35:32.100 --> 35:35.780
So probably 60-40 split, I would say,

35:35.780 --> 35:38.140
between GNOME Shell and KDE Neon.

35:38.140 --> 35:39.060
Oh, okay.

35:39.060 --> 35:41.420
And yes, I do still love it.

35:41.420 --> 35:45.060
I've just finished doing a review of the KDE Slimbook,

35:45.060 --> 35:48.420
which will go out next week, 31st, on Ubuntu Podcast.

35:48.420 --> 35:49.340
Nice.

35:49.340 --> 35:53.060
And it's the KDE Slimbook and KDE Neon together.

35:53.060 --> 35:55.420
I'm sorry about that train going by.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.060
It's like they were designed for each other.

35:57.060 --> 35:58.460
It's just great.

35:58.460 --> 35:59.980
On that laptop, it's perfect.

35:59.980 --> 36:01.980
Oh, boy, I look forward to hearing that.

36:01.980 --> 36:02.820
So what do you think?

36:02.820 --> 36:05.300
Do you think there is more buzz

36:05.300 --> 36:07.180
around Qt and Plasma these days?

36:07.180 --> 36:09.500
Or is it just because I'm using it more?

36:09.500 --> 36:13.380
I think they've got over that hill

36:13.380 --> 36:16.820
where it seemed that everything was insurmountable,

36:16.820 --> 36:19.460
that it was just, everything looked bad,

36:19.460 --> 36:21.820
it performed bad, it felt bad,

36:21.820 --> 36:24.940
and everyone just felt awful using it.

36:24.940 --> 36:26.300
And they've got past that.

36:26.300 --> 36:27.820
That's now in the past,

36:27.820 --> 36:30.380
and we can forget all about that and move on

36:30.380 --> 36:33.940
and use what they have now, which is brilliant.

36:33.940 --> 36:35.220
And I get updates all the time

36:35.220 --> 36:37.340
because they've got a KDE Neon repo

36:37.340 --> 36:39.460
that's enabled on the KDE Neon images,

36:39.460 --> 36:41.340
so I get constant flow of updates.

36:41.340 --> 36:42.980
I'm always getting the new crack.

36:42.980 --> 36:44.060
It's fantastic.

36:44.060 --> 36:44.900
It's really great.

36:44.900 --> 36:45.740
I love it.

36:45.740 --> 36:47.820
It kind of feels like those post-320 days

36:47.820 --> 36:49.740
in the gnome world when, oh, yes,

36:49.740 --> 36:51.500
this stuff is new and it's usable now,

36:51.500 --> 36:53.420
and you can actually use it in a real system

36:53.420 --> 36:54.500
and it just works.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.500
I really think we need to draw a line in the sand

36:56.500 --> 36:58.260
and say, you know what?

36:58.260 --> 37:01.020
What went before, some of it wasn't good,

37:01.020 --> 37:01.900
but let's look forward.

37:01.900 --> 37:04.140
Let's move forward and look at all the great work

37:04.140 --> 37:05.620
the KDE guys are doing

37:05.620 --> 37:07.780
and the great work that Kubuntu are doing to integrate

37:07.780 --> 37:10.380
that into Ubuntu so that if people want to stay on Ubuntu

37:10.380 --> 37:13.380
and don't like the idea of this fast movie KDE Neon thing,

37:13.380 --> 37:14.980
they can have Kubuntu.

37:14.980 --> 37:17.140
And all the other distros that are using KDE as well,

37:17.140 --> 37:19.380
like OpenSUSE and everyone else,

37:19.380 --> 37:23.020
they're all delivering the best of what KDE guys are doing.

37:23.020 --> 37:24.060
I'm blown away by it.

37:24.060 --> 37:29.060
You know, I just gave the latest OpenSUSE a go

37:30.900 --> 37:33.700
and it's not bad.

37:33.700 --> 37:36.380
OpenSUSE Leap 15,

37:36.380 --> 37:38.820
but they change a few of the defaults in Plasma

37:38.820 --> 37:42.100
that I feel like maybe were a good idea,

37:42.100 --> 37:44.820
like replacing the launcher and a few other things.

37:46.340 --> 37:48.980
But now I kind of dislike it.

37:48.980 --> 37:53.220
I feel like it's not as good as the upstream stuff.

37:53.220 --> 37:57.060
I thought OpenSUSE was mostly pure upstream.

37:57.060 --> 37:58.340
Is that not the case?

37:58.340 --> 38:00.700
Yeah, well, their launcher's not, that's for sure.

38:00.700 --> 38:04.700
And I don't know, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.660
I'm sorry to just derail the show,

38:06.660 --> 38:10.100
but somebody just, a motorcyclist just drove by my window

38:10.100 --> 38:12.300
and he was sitting on his handlebars.

38:12.300 --> 38:15.180
He was not sitting in the seat of his motorcycle.

38:15.180 --> 38:16.620
This town is crazy.

38:16.620 --> 38:19.620
Also, there's just some crazy people walking around

38:19.620 --> 38:22.700
with their clothes off, nothing but their underwear on,

38:22.700 --> 38:24.780
carrying signs about Jesus in this town.

38:24.780 --> 38:27.060
This is a fun one to hang out in.

38:27.060 --> 38:28.580
Anyways, back to OpenSUSE.

38:28.580 --> 38:31.420
Yeah, I mean, so I just gave Leap a try for Linux Action News.

38:31.420 --> 38:33.420
Pretty solid, pretty solid release, really.

38:33.420 --> 38:36.820
And I like the fact that they're gonna make it official

38:36.820 --> 38:40.460
that you can upgrade from Leap to Enterprise.

38:40.460 --> 38:42.500
But yeah, I don't know.

38:42.500 --> 38:43.940
I feel like you're right, Poppy,

38:43.940 --> 38:46.100
that we should just sort of draw a line and say,

38:46.100 --> 38:49.980
things were kind of bad and now things are better.

38:49.980 --> 38:52.380
We've worked on things and things have gotten better.

38:52.380 --> 38:55.620
And maybe some decisions like replacing the launchers

38:55.620 --> 38:58.300
or replacing the login manager and things like that,

38:58.300 --> 39:00.220
maybe it's time to reconsider some of that.

39:00.220 --> 39:01.900
And to be fair, I kind of feel like

39:01.900 --> 39:03.660
that's what Ubuntu just did recently

39:03.660 --> 39:06.860
with the 1710 release, it was like a huge reconsideration.

39:06.860 --> 39:10.140
If you look back at that original Hacker News thread

39:10.140 --> 39:12.860
about all of the stuff they wanted to change in 1710

39:12.860 --> 39:16.060
or before 1710 when people were submitting suggestions

39:16.060 --> 39:17.380
and then you look what shipped,

39:17.380 --> 39:19.060
a lot of that stuff got rethought.

39:19.060 --> 39:20.940
And I think every distribution just needs to do that

39:20.940 --> 39:21.780
from time to time.

39:21.780 --> 39:23.940
And I think people's assumptions about the distribution

39:23.940 --> 39:25.860
from time to time and I think people's assumptions

39:25.860 --> 39:29.060
about some of these desktops and file systems

39:29.060 --> 39:30.340
needs to be rethought.

39:30.340 --> 39:35.260
BcacheFS is working on going upstream in the Linux kernel.

39:35.260 --> 39:37.300
I am a patron of Kent Overstreet

39:37.300 --> 39:39.900
because damn am I excited about this development.

39:39.900 --> 39:43.620
And he's been spending a few years working on BcacheFS

39:43.620 --> 39:47.540
and it's based out of the Bcache BlockCache technology.

39:47.540 --> 39:50.100
And he's working now to upstream that

39:50.100 --> 39:51.260
to the mainline kernel.

39:51.260 --> 39:53.900
He believes, Kent believes that the on-disk format

39:53.900 --> 39:55.580
BcacheFS is now in good shape

39:55.580 --> 40:00.260
and he doesn't see any major on-disk format changes coming

40:00.260 --> 40:01.580
from this point forward.

40:01.580 --> 40:03.780
BcacheFS is ready to go.

40:03.780 --> 40:06.060
It's a copy on-write file system

40:07.100 --> 40:10.420
that supports native compression, encryption,

40:10.420 --> 40:13.540
caching, snapshots, multiple devices

40:13.540 --> 40:16.660
and lots of other modern capabilities.

40:16.660 --> 40:19.220
So we can just sort of look at BcacheFS

40:19.220 --> 40:20.960
and say, guys, that was a great effort.

40:20.960 --> 40:21.880
Thank you so much.

40:21.880 --> 40:23.680
What's come before is appreciated

40:23.680 --> 40:26.860
but let's look forward to BcacheFS

40:26.860 --> 40:30.220
maybe shipping in 4.18 if we're lucky.

40:30.220 --> 40:31.220
What do you think Wes?

40:31.220 --> 40:32.500
Yeah, it does kind of feel like

40:32.500 --> 40:37.420
the last great Linux file system hope for the modern era.

40:37.420 --> 40:39.020
And, you know, it started from Bcache

40:39.020 --> 40:41.980
which has a really, has had solid technical foundations.

40:41.980 --> 40:43.720
Lots of people have used it.

40:43.720 --> 40:45.940
We've been kind of, it's been in the wings waiting

40:45.940 --> 40:47.560
just cut quietly working.

40:47.560 --> 40:49.820
It's somewhat surprising in some sense

40:49.820 --> 40:50.700
that there's been less,

40:50.700 --> 40:52.240
there hasn't been that much resistance.

40:52.240 --> 40:54.220
It seems like, you know, Kent obviously benefits

40:54.220 --> 40:55.420
from having a long history working

40:55.420 --> 40:57.700
with the kernel community in contributions.

40:57.700 --> 40:59.940
So he kind of knows how to play the game here.

40:59.940 --> 41:01.700
And there's not a ton of crazy changes

41:01.700 --> 41:03.060
all around the kernel that have to get made

41:03.060 --> 41:05.300
to facilitate this being upstreamed.

41:05.300 --> 41:06.660
Now, of course, we should,

41:06.660 --> 41:08.440
we have to wait and see how the patches are received,

41:08.440 --> 41:10.600
see what the actual review is, what kind of, you know,

41:10.600 --> 41:12.060
timeline, is it going to be a couple releases?

41:12.060 --> 41:14.580
Is it going to end up in 4.18?

41:14.580 --> 41:15.420
Who knows?

41:15.420 --> 41:17.660
But as a personal user of BcacheFS

41:17.660 --> 41:19.820
and having to, you know, compile the module myself

41:19.820 --> 41:22.180
and add it in, I'm not doing anything fancy with it

41:22.180 --> 41:24.900
but it's been rock solid for me.

41:24.900 --> 41:27.100
Interesting, I also saw there's some talk here

41:27.100 --> 41:30.500
of providing an upgrade patch for Bcache users.

41:30.500 --> 41:32.740
I guess a lot of what BcacheFS really is

41:32.740 --> 41:35.140
is just an improved version of Bcache.

41:35.140 --> 41:37.640
So at some point when you want to switch to this new code,

41:37.640 --> 41:39.900
you'll be able to kind of transparently do so.

41:39.900 --> 41:41.660
That's really cool.

41:41.660 --> 41:43.660
Yeah, you make a good point

41:43.660 --> 41:45.540
that there isn't a lot of dramatic changes

41:45.540 --> 41:47.220
that have to happen to the Linux kernel

41:47.220 --> 41:48.380
to actually facilitate this.

41:48.380 --> 41:51.100
So it could be pretty smooth

41:51.100 --> 41:52.780
and Kent does have the experience there.

41:52.780 --> 41:56.380
TechMav in the irc, irc.geekshed.net,

41:56.380 --> 41:57.700
Pound Jupiter Broadcasting,

41:57.700 --> 42:00.140
he's asking if there's any updates on Strata

42:00.140 --> 42:01.780
or Stratus from Red Hat,

42:01.780 --> 42:04.980
which if you recall is their disk management system

42:04.980 --> 42:07.820
that looks like it's a whole bunch of really nice utilities

42:07.820 --> 42:10.560
including things like the XFS disk format and whatnot

42:10.560 --> 42:12.620
that are sort of brought together

42:12.620 --> 42:15.620
as a ButterFS replacement or ZFS alternative.

42:15.620 --> 42:19.500
And I don't think there's a big movement publicly at TechMav

42:19.500 --> 42:23.140
but I believe if things go as planned,

42:23.140 --> 42:26.540
we may see more in Fedora 29

42:26.540 --> 42:30.240
and I think there is some previews in Fedora 28

42:30.240 --> 42:31.420
for Strata as well.

42:31.420 --> 42:32.340
I suspect that's gonna be something

42:32.340 --> 42:35.520
that lands surprisingly at some point, it'll just drop.

42:35.520 --> 42:37.260
Yeah, and then it'll be in a Red Hat Enterprise release.

42:37.260 --> 42:39.180
It'll be like in the next big release.

42:39.180 --> 42:40.120
Yeah, exactly.

42:40.120 --> 42:41.360
But if none of that works out for you,

42:41.360 --> 42:42.940
then why not try NetBSD

42:42.940 --> 42:46.500
because at least over at the NetBSD project this week,

42:46.500 --> 42:49.020
they're announcing some of the initial results

42:49.020 --> 42:53.940
from a massive audit of the NetBSD network stack.

42:53.940 --> 42:55.860
It's just wrapping up now.

42:55.860 --> 42:58.940
It's been going on for five fricking months.

42:58.940 --> 43:01.580
Already hundreds of patches have been committed

43:01.580 --> 43:03.540
to the source tree as a result of the work.

43:03.540 --> 43:05.540
Dozens of bugs have been fixed

43:05.540 --> 43:09.140
and a good number of actual remote triggering vulnerabilities

43:09.140 --> 43:10.500
were discovered.

43:10.500 --> 43:12.920
Changes were made to NetBSD's networking stack

43:12.920 --> 43:14.700
to strengthen the networking subsystem

43:14.700 --> 43:16.220
and improve code quality.

43:16.220 --> 43:20.100
And it was done in several layers of the NetBSD kernel

43:20.100 --> 43:22.980
from drivers all the way up to the main L4 handlers.

43:22.980 --> 43:25.380
And a lot of cleanup took place as well.

43:25.380 --> 43:29.300
And it's one of these, and also code removal,

43:29.300 --> 43:30.940
but it's one of these things when I see this,

43:30.940 --> 43:34.560
I go, can we do this in all of the places?

43:34.560 --> 43:36.300
So I tried to dig in and figure out

43:36.300 --> 43:39.300
what's actually happening here in a code review like this.

43:39.300 --> 43:41.420
And it feels very nebulous.

43:41.420 --> 43:46.180
It can vary a lot from static code analysis,

43:46.180 --> 43:48.500
machine scripts you run it through

43:48.500 --> 43:49.940
that just do static code analysis

43:49.940 --> 43:52.180
to like experts reviewing the code.

43:52.180 --> 43:55.660
There's a big range of ways to audit code,

43:55.660 --> 43:58.920
but it does seem like every time we do something like this,

43:58.920 --> 44:01.380
a whole bunch of stuff is discovered.

44:01.380 --> 44:03.820
I really applaud the NetBSD project for sitting down

44:03.820 --> 44:05.300
and doing this work.

44:05.300 --> 44:08.260
And then also trying to see if maybe some of those same

44:08.260 --> 44:10.220
things apply to some of the other BSDs.

44:10.220 --> 44:11.500
It's nice to see that happening.

44:11.500 --> 44:13.920
Even if it's not a Linux related story,

44:13.920 --> 44:15.740
it's nice to see an audit like this.

44:15.740 --> 44:16.580
Oh yeah, right.

44:16.580 --> 44:17.860
I mean, NetBSD is super useful.

44:17.860 --> 44:20.940
It's a great open source operating system.

44:20.940 --> 44:23.940
And it's just done a great job of maintaining

44:23.940 --> 44:28.020
a pretty clean code base and they have good features.

44:28.020 --> 44:29.540
There's a lot of stuff happening there

44:29.540 --> 44:30.900
we don't talk about very much

44:30.900 --> 44:34.020
and props to them for taking security seriously.

44:34.020 --> 44:35.540
Yeah, and it's good to see that the BSDs

44:35.540 --> 44:36.740
can actually do this from time to time

44:36.740 --> 44:38.380
because nobody uses them, of course.

44:38.380 --> 44:40.340
So therefore these things need to happen.

44:40.340 --> 44:43.100
I mean, oh, I had to.

44:43.100 --> 44:44.640
It's Linux unplugged after all.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.560
There is a great bit of write up in the blog post

44:47.560 --> 44:48.620
that we'll have linked to the show notes

44:48.620 --> 44:51.660
at linuxunplugged.com slash 251

44:51.660 --> 44:55.040
about like the actual bugs and what they caused

44:55.040 --> 44:56.060
and how they were fixed.

44:56.060 --> 44:59.820
It's really in depth, tech snap level in depth

44:59.820 --> 45:02.620
kind of stuff if you want to go get all kind of cray cray.

45:02.620 --> 45:05.000
Maybe even future tech snap material

45:05.000 --> 45:07.220
if those BSD now guys don't steal it from us, Wes.

45:07.220 --> 45:08.040
I hope they don't.

45:08.040 --> 45:09.740
Now let's talk about an app pick this week.

45:09.740 --> 45:11.700
We haven't done one yet in the show.

45:11.700 --> 45:14.700
Slow-mo video, everybody's all about it on YouTube.

45:14.700 --> 45:15.940
But how do you do it?

45:15.940 --> 45:17.440
How do you do it?

45:17.440 --> 45:19.700
How do you do it with open source software?

45:19.700 --> 45:23.140
Slow-mo video on GitHub accomplishes just that.

45:23.140 --> 45:25.420
It's slow-mo for all the things

45:25.420 --> 45:28.280
and it'll give you a nice step-by-step way

45:28.280 --> 45:29.940
to create three different types of slow-mo

45:29.940 --> 45:31.580
in case that wasn't enough slow-mo.

45:31.580 --> 45:32.980
You can have three different types

45:32.980 --> 45:35.360
and it is linked in the show notes

45:35.360 --> 45:38.380
and it does, of course, work on Linux.

45:38.380 --> 45:40.060
Slow-mo video for all the things.

45:40.060 --> 45:41.900
Why not have it, you can have it.

45:41.900 --> 45:42.740
And if you can't do it open source,

45:42.740 --> 45:44.100
can you even really do it at all?

45:44.100 --> 45:44.940
We say no.

45:46.320 --> 45:47.980
We shouldn't call it open source or free software,

45:47.980 --> 45:49.200
we should call it sustainable.

45:49.200 --> 45:50.300
It's sustainable software.

45:50.300 --> 45:52.020
There we go, sustainable software.

45:52.020 --> 45:53.860
You heard it here first, small batch.

45:55.740 --> 45:58.880
Small batch, sustainable, organically,

45:58.880 --> 46:01.400
locally sourced, open source software.

46:01.400 --> 46:03.020
That's what you should call it.

46:03.020 --> 46:05.080
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

46:05.080 --> 46:06.900
Now I want to thank Ting.

46:06.900 --> 46:07.980
Thank you so much, Ting,

46:07.980 --> 46:10.980
for making even a couple of bars in Grants Pass

46:10.980 --> 46:13.340
when the whole town is out of internet possible.

46:13.340 --> 46:15.500
At least the cell towers still have internet.

46:15.500 --> 46:16.900
Ting is smarter than unlimited.

46:16.900 --> 46:18.340
If you use less, you pay less.

46:18.340 --> 46:20.140
So go to linux.ting.com.

46:20.140 --> 46:22.180
They'll take $25 off a device.

46:22.180 --> 46:23.500
If you have one that's compatible

46:23.500 --> 46:25.740
because they have GSM and CDMA,

46:25.740 --> 46:29.140
then they'll give you $25 in service credit.

46:29.140 --> 46:33.100
Now I'm sitting here in a tiny hotel room,

46:33.100 --> 46:34.360
if you can't tell,

46:34.360 --> 46:36.540
which sounds nothing like my regular studio.

46:36.540 --> 46:40.400
And I am literally in a town

46:40.400 --> 46:42.840
that is without internet today.

46:42.840 --> 46:44.380
And if it wasn't for Ting,

46:44.380 --> 46:48.540
I wouldn't even be able to record in this tiny hotel room

46:48.540 --> 46:50.100
while they work on LadyJuice.

46:50.100 --> 46:51.860
It's so flexible.

46:51.860 --> 46:53.780
And this is what I love about it as a small business owner.

46:53.780 --> 46:54.620
I'm gonna take a minute.

46:54.620 --> 46:56.180
I usually, I try to talk about this

46:56.180 --> 46:57.760
from a consumer standpoint,

46:57.760 --> 46:59.400
but this week I want to talk to you guys about this

46:59.400 --> 47:00.820
from a small business standpoint.

47:00.820 --> 47:03.300
If you have more than three lines and you're on Ting,

47:03.300 --> 47:04.800
you're gonna start saving money immediately

47:04.800 --> 47:05.880
as a small business owner.

47:05.880 --> 47:07.420
If you go above 10 lines,

47:07.420 --> 47:10.260
nobody in the US is gonna beat Ting.

47:10.260 --> 47:12.020
It's $6 a month for the line.

47:12.020 --> 47:13.780
And then it's just your minutes, your megabytes,

47:13.780 --> 47:16.540
your whatever, you just pay for what you use.

47:16.540 --> 47:19.660
It's not like in the past

47:19.660 --> 47:20.960
where I worked in other organizations

47:20.960 --> 47:24.340
where every single line was like $25 to add a line.

47:24.340 --> 47:27.300
And then we had like this really complicated pool of minutes

47:27.300 --> 47:28.940
and a pool of data.

47:28.940 --> 47:31.140
And so if one person was using a lot of data

47:31.140 --> 47:34.800
while they were in some really kind of tiny hotel room,

47:34.800 --> 47:36.220
then the rest of the team

47:36.220 --> 47:37.780
would sort of have to try to conserve data

47:37.780 --> 47:39.260
because we had this pool that we were pulling.

47:39.260 --> 47:42.380
It's so complicated and so obtuse

47:42.380 --> 47:44.700
that the staff didn't really track it

47:44.700 --> 47:46.140
and didn't really pay attention

47:46.140 --> 47:48.300
and it didn't really work for anybody.

47:48.300 --> 47:49.580
And with Ting, it's just,

47:49.580 --> 47:51.860
it's really easy for everyone to understand.

47:51.860 --> 47:54.500
$6 for the line and then your usage on top of that.

47:54.500 --> 47:55.340
That's it.

47:55.340 --> 47:57.180
It's so straightforward.

47:57.180 --> 48:00.780
The average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month.

48:00.780 --> 48:01.620
That's easy.

48:01.620 --> 48:02.820
That's totally easy.

48:02.820 --> 48:03.740
And if you go to Ting,

48:03.740 --> 48:05.020
they have an excellent control panel.

48:05.020 --> 48:07.460
You can turn off individual services

48:07.460 --> 48:10.340
or set limits and usage alerts and all of that kind of stuff.

48:10.340 --> 48:12.740
It's so useful when I'm on the road

48:12.740 --> 48:14.120
or when we have an event going on,

48:14.120 --> 48:16.420
I cannot tell you how great it is.

48:16.420 --> 48:18.700
And they really don't care what you wanna use

48:18.700 --> 48:19.860
or how you wanna use it.

48:20.700 --> 48:21.780
I really appreciate that too.

48:21.780 --> 48:23.620
Like if you get to a point

48:23.620 --> 48:27.380
where you can get some crazy ass wearable device

48:27.380 --> 48:30.340
with Asteroid OS or something on a cellular network,

48:30.340 --> 48:31.180
Ting's cool with that.

48:31.180 --> 48:33.780
You just go buy a SIM card directly from them.

48:33.780 --> 48:36.220
They have this approach that's really kind of hands off.

48:36.220 --> 48:37.860
And I'm putting words in their mouth,

48:37.860 --> 48:39.220
but they're just a dumb pipe.

48:39.220 --> 48:40.540
They just, they're totally cool.

48:40.540 --> 48:42.500
If you only wanna use them as a dumb pipe

48:42.500 --> 48:45.420
to get data down to a device, totally okay with that.

48:45.420 --> 48:48.220
If you wanna use them for emergency phone calls

48:48.220 --> 48:50.060
and you have like a phone in your glove box

48:50.060 --> 48:51.700
that you use every now and then,

48:51.700 --> 48:53.880
they're totally okay with that too.

48:53.880 --> 48:54.720
I love that.

48:54.720 --> 48:58.460
And they got no big like strategic reason,

48:58.460 --> 49:00.860
no strategy tax for why they can't just send updates

49:00.860 --> 49:01.880
down to your phone.

49:01.880 --> 49:03.940
They're not gonna get in the way with the Ting experience.

49:03.940 --> 49:05.820
So if you want to go get something from them

49:05.820 --> 49:06.660
or bring your own device

49:06.660 --> 49:08.500
and you wanna get updates every single month

49:08.500 --> 49:10.900
or you want a device that stays updated and secure,

49:10.900 --> 49:12.840
they're not gonna get in the way of that.

49:12.840 --> 49:15.020
I like all of those things, linux.ting.com.

49:15.020 --> 49:17.620
Go there to support the show and get $25 off a device

49:17.620 --> 49:19.620
and to get $25 in service credit

49:19.620 --> 49:22.820
if you bring your own device, linux.ting.com.

49:23.740 --> 49:25.100
Oh yeah, all right.

49:26.740 --> 49:27.700
I wanna try something new.

49:27.700 --> 49:28.620
You ready?

49:28.620 --> 49:31.740
West, you got your, get your pants unbuttoned.

49:31.740 --> 49:34.660
Make room for ultimate comfort.

49:34.660 --> 49:36.060
Here we go.

49:36.060 --> 49:38.340
Let's talk about Fedora 26.

49:38.340 --> 49:41.940
Fedora 26, which came out two releases ago.

49:41.940 --> 49:45.460
Let's spend a moment and talk about it.

49:45.460 --> 49:48.060
I thought about making this an official segment on the show

49:48.060 --> 49:51.080
but instead, this is just an FYI to Fedora users.

49:51.080 --> 49:55.100
Fedora 26 is ending its life support.

49:55.100 --> 49:57.820
It's no longer getting patches very, very soon.

49:57.820 --> 49:59.500
And I wanted to kind of give you a PSA,

49:59.500 --> 50:02.100
but I thought let's look back and see where we were at.

50:02.100 --> 50:04.220
And I might do this with future distros too

50:04.220 --> 50:07.540
as they end support, maybe look back at their prime,

50:07.540 --> 50:09.740
see what they brought new to the table back then,

50:09.740 --> 50:11.540
which is kind of interesting to look

50:11.540 --> 50:12.740
where we're sitting at now.

50:12.740 --> 50:15.720
So as you know, Fedora 28 was recently released,

50:15.720 --> 50:18.340
which means Fedora 26 is hitting end of life

50:18.340 --> 50:20.660
on May 29th, 2018.

50:20.660 --> 50:22.260
That's just, well, that's today.

50:23.420 --> 50:26.100
So as this episode records, that is right now,

50:26.100 --> 50:28.780
it is end of life, Fedora 26 is end of life.

50:28.780 --> 50:32.640
So you may feel like that's a little early

50:32.640 --> 50:33.480
and you're right.

50:35.660 --> 50:38.220
Fedora 28 was released on time.

50:38.220 --> 50:41.540
You see, that doesn't normally happen for the Fedora project

50:41.540 --> 50:44.260
and I forgot to make a big deal about it at the time,

50:44.260 --> 50:45.900
so I'm making up for that right now.

50:45.900 --> 50:49.300
But see, they screwed you when they released it on time.

50:49.300 --> 50:52.940
They screwed you if you're a Fedora 26 user

50:52.940 --> 50:56.680
because that means that Fedora 26

50:56.680 --> 50:59.420
is now at that end of life period.

50:59.420 --> 51:03.740
Even though it hasn't fully been 11 months for Fedora 26,

51:03.740 --> 51:06.720
it's part of the life cycle for Fedora.

51:08.200 --> 51:12.180
So you just kinda have to just move on now.

51:12.180 --> 51:15.020
And I apologize for all of you Noah Chalias out there

51:15.020 --> 51:17.020
that are still rocking Fedora 26

51:17.020 --> 51:18.740
and everything's working good.

51:18.740 --> 51:20.700
That's just the way this works and we all knew it.

51:20.700 --> 51:22.260
And that's why I've been testing the upgrades

51:22.260 --> 51:23.860
for a long, long time now.

51:23.860 --> 51:26.780
So I recommend you upgrade to Fedora 28

51:26.780 --> 51:30.280
and I tested going from Fedora 26 to Fedora 28

51:30.280 --> 51:32.120
and it works good.

51:32.120 --> 51:35.740
It wasn't a super complicated rig, but I would recommend it.

51:35.740 --> 51:37.800
And I think it's worth considering

51:37.800 --> 51:40.380
because the Fedora 26 wallet was really great.

51:40.380 --> 51:42.520
Fedora 28 I think is one of their best releases

51:42.520 --> 51:44.300
and I think it's a pretty solid upgrade.

51:44.300 --> 51:45.920
But let's look back at 26 for a moment.

51:45.920 --> 51:48.580
Just take a moment and look back at 26.

51:48.580 --> 51:50.740
During its lifetime, the Fedora community

51:50.740 --> 51:53.060
published nearly 10,000 updates

51:53.060 --> 51:55.380
to Fedora 26's repositories.

51:55.380 --> 51:57.700
During Fedora 26's release,

51:57.700 --> 52:01.700
it was hyped for having version 3.24 of GNOME.

52:01.700 --> 52:04.700
It came with a new partitioning tool in Anaconda

52:04.700 --> 52:07.220
and it shipped with DNF 2.5

52:07.220 --> 52:09.860
as well as the Python classroom lab.

52:09.860 --> 52:13.020
And that all in itself, the new partitioning actually,

52:13.020 --> 52:14.420
the new partitioning tool in Anaconda

52:14.420 --> 52:16.100
was kind of a big deal.

52:16.100 --> 52:18.140
And it was something that even Wes and I remarked

52:18.140 --> 52:20.260
on our review of 28 recently

52:20.260 --> 52:21.820
is that this is still a little odd.

52:21.820 --> 52:23.780
Oh yeah, I love that thing.

52:23.780 --> 52:26.340
So looking back on Fedora 26, pretty nice release,

52:26.340 --> 52:28.180
but here's the cadence you need to keep in mind.

52:28.180 --> 52:29.800
The Fedora project provides updates

52:29.800 --> 52:31.620
for a particular release until a month

52:31.620 --> 52:36.620
after the second subsequent version of Fedora is released.

52:36.680 --> 52:39.620
So Fedora 26 continues to one month

52:39.620 --> 52:41.580
after Fedora 28 has been released.

52:41.580 --> 52:44.500
So here we are, it is time to pay.

52:44.500 --> 52:45.800
But time does move on.

52:45.800 --> 52:47.440
Things that were done in the past have wrapped up.

52:47.440 --> 52:48.640
It's time to embrace the new stuff.

52:48.640 --> 52:50.420
And if you're a Fedora 28 user already,

52:50.420 --> 52:53.100
then you're probably looking forward to Fedora 29,

52:53.100 --> 52:56.260
which comes with a new D-Bus, D-Bus broker,

52:56.260 --> 53:00.180
also Project Silver Blue or Atomic Workstation,

53:00.180 --> 53:01.260
whatever you like to call it,

53:01.260 --> 53:05.020
is supposedly getting a more feature complete release.

53:05.020 --> 53:08.460
And we're gonna see Xorg 1.20 in Fedora 29.

53:08.460 --> 53:11.080
So there's already some nice things in the works

53:11.080 --> 53:12.980
for the next version of Fedora.

53:12.980 --> 53:14.700
I think it's gonna be your new distro of choice, Wes.

53:14.700 --> 53:15.540
I can see it already.

53:15.540 --> 53:18.060
I am actually kind of excited.

53:18.060 --> 53:19.660
And maybe if you're like big into IoT,

53:19.660 --> 53:22.060
it sounds like there's gonna be an IoT edition.

53:23.180 --> 53:24.500
Everybody's making IoT editions.

53:24.500 --> 53:25.500
It's the next big thing.

53:25.500 --> 53:28.740
I mean, their goal is to be the default IoT operating system.

53:28.740 --> 53:29.580
We'll see if it happens.

53:29.580 --> 53:32.540
Now, I guess, I mean, if this was two years ago,

53:32.540 --> 53:34.980
it would be a mobile edition, and now it's IoT edition.

53:34.980 --> 53:35.820
Yeah, you're right.

53:35.820 --> 53:38.020
Next up, blockchain edition, right?

53:39.220 --> 53:42.660
Fedora is, in my opinion, better than ever.

53:42.660 --> 53:44.900
And I think if you haven't tried it for a while,

53:44.900 --> 53:45.840
it's worth taking another look

53:45.840 --> 53:47.740
because I think 28 was a great release

53:47.740 --> 53:52.740
and I've been using the hell out of QoNotes

53:53.020 --> 53:54.900
and Nextcloud on Fedora 28.

53:54.900 --> 53:59.140
So that's sort of been influencing my opinion

53:59.140 --> 54:00.940
of what makes it such a good releases.

54:00.940 --> 54:02.560
It's been working great for me on the server.

54:02.560 --> 54:03.580
Surprise, surprise.

54:05.180 --> 54:08.060
Speaking of servers, do.co slash unplugged.

54:08.060 --> 54:10.240
Do.co slash unplugged is where you go

54:10.240 --> 54:12.300
to get $100 credit for DigitalOcean.

54:12.300 --> 54:14.100
Go over to DigitalOcean and spin up a rig

54:14.100 --> 54:16.020
in less than 55 seconds.

54:16.020 --> 54:17.480
Everything is SSDs.

54:17.480 --> 54:19.900
The entire stack or just the bare system.

54:19.900 --> 54:23.140
So take a, for example, Fedora 28 cloud.

54:23.140 --> 54:25.220
When you spin up a Fedora 28 cloud instance

54:25.220 --> 54:28.660
on DigitalOcean, you don't even set a root password.

54:28.660 --> 54:30.540
You don't get emailed a root password.

54:31.560 --> 54:33.200
You add an SSH key.

54:33.200 --> 54:36.380
You add your SSH key because this Fedora cloud

54:36.380 --> 54:39.900
is built to run on these exact types of instances.

54:39.900 --> 54:42.320
You spin it up in seconds and you just SSH right in

54:42.320 --> 54:43.400
and you get working.

54:43.400 --> 54:45.020
You can manage all of your DNS,

54:45.020 --> 54:46.920
you can add new storage as you need,

54:46.920 --> 54:48.620
and they have these flexible droplets

54:48.620 --> 54:50.880
where you can mix and match the resources

54:50.880 --> 54:53.020
that are most appropriate for your application.

54:53.020 --> 54:54.000
So try it out.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.700
Go to do.co slash unplugged.

54:56.700 --> 54:58.920
You sign up with a new account, you get a $100 credit,

54:58.920 --> 54:59.760
and you can try it out.

54:59.760 --> 55:01.520
They got data centers all over the world,

55:01.520 --> 55:06.000
SSDs for everything, $5 a month for the starting price.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.620
My favorite rig, three cents an hour.

55:08.620 --> 55:09.460
Check it out.

55:09.460 --> 55:11.560
Do.co slash unplugged.

55:11.560 --> 55:14.640
It's DigitalOcean and it's something that's worth your time.

55:14.640 --> 55:16.600
It's worth trying out, it's worth kicking the tires

55:16.600 --> 55:19.680
because I've gone from building systems on my LAN

55:19.680 --> 55:21.040
to this is my data center now.

55:21.040 --> 55:23.280
And I would not lightly tell you that.

55:23.280 --> 55:25.840
It took me a couple of years to make the transition.

55:25.840 --> 55:28.000
I've been a DigitalOcean customer for years now,

55:28.000 --> 55:30.700
four years, maybe, maybe even longer.

55:31.680 --> 55:34.120
And it's still something that's a transition for me

55:34.120 --> 55:36.700
because I started in the industry

55:36.700 --> 55:37.880
setting up servers in racks.

55:37.880 --> 55:40.580
That's really how I got started is building servers

55:40.580 --> 55:42.760
and installing them in racks and really big data centers.

55:42.760 --> 55:45.280
And I've always had that mentality.

55:45.280 --> 55:47.720
But the flexibility, the control I have

55:47.720 --> 55:49.600
and the speed in which I can get something set up

55:49.600 --> 55:52.560
and running in production, it's a game changer for me.

55:52.560 --> 55:53.760
It's a real game changer.

55:53.760 --> 55:54.880
And I'd like you to try it out.

55:54.880 --> 55:57.480
You can get $100 for 60 days

55:57.480 --> 55:59.000
to try out the DigitalOcean infrastructure.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.120
Do.co slash unplugged.

56:02.120 --> 56:03.440
Big thank you to DigitalOcean

56:03.440 --> 56:05.240
for sponsoring the unplugged program.

56:06.680 --> 56:10.440
I don't know if I ever saw this one coming,

56:11.400 --> 56:13.720
but I am very, very happy it is here.

56:13.720 --> 56:16.440
The Sega Mega Drive and Genesis Classic

56:16.440 --> 56:18.960
is now supported on Linux.

56:18.960 --> 56:20.520
There's a big price drop.

56:20.520 --> 56:22.920
Now think about this as like this arcade

56:22.920 --> 56:24.920
to run classic Sega games.

56:24.920 --> 56:27.320
And not only did they add Linux support,

56:27.320 --> 56:29.040
but they've also upgraded new features

56:29.040 --> 56:32.840
like two-player online support, challenge modes,

56:33.880 --> 56:35.440
ROMs from other regions,

56:35.440 --> 56:37.200
which I don't even understand why they put that in there.

56:37.200 --> 56:39.000
That's so great.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.520
VR support, which is ridiculous.

56:41.520 --> 56:43.080
It includes over 50 titles.

56:43.080 --> 56:44.200
Yeah, seriously.

56:44.200 --> 56:46.520
And it's all like these classic Sega games

56:46.520 --> 56:48.600
that you can now play on Linux.

56:48.600 --> 56:50.640
And it's supported by them.

56:50.640 --> 56:53.080
And it's like 30 bucks for the whole collection,

56:53.080 --> 56:54.760
the entire collection.

56:54.760 --> 56:57.200
Does this make it the year of the Linux gaming desktop?

56:57.200 --> 56:58.760
Have we finally arrived?

57:00.640 --> 57:02.200
Maybe they're getting ready for all those Chromebooks

57:02.200 --> 57:04.720
that are gonna let you run Linux apps.

57:05.680 --> 57:06.520
Damn it.

57:07.720 --> 57:08.560
Oh, damn it.

57:08.560 --> 57:09.400
I hope that's not why.

57:09.400 --> 57:10.760
Actually, now that I said that,

57:10.760 --> 57:12.760
but they're shipping it via Steam, so I doubt it.

57:12.760 --> 57:15.040
But I suppose you could install Steam on a Chromebook.

57:15.040 --> 57:16.160
I don't know.

57:16.160 --> 57:19.880
LG is shipping a 37-inch ultra-wide screen

57:19.880 --> 57:22.560
that can run Ubuntu or Linux.

57:22.560 --> 57:25.000
Sega Mega Drive is updating for Linux.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.040
Chrome, aka Google,

57:28.040 --> 57:32.000
is working hard to get Linux support on Chromebooks.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.720
Microsoft is spending a ton of resources

57:34.720 --> 57:36.320
and getting a lot of public attention

57:36.320 --> 57:38.120
for the Windows subsystem for Linux.

57:38.120 --> 57:40.960
And Samsung is trying to make Linux apps

57:40.960 --> 57:42.920
run on their mobile phones in some sort

57:42.920 --> 57:44.520
of convergence environment.

57:44.520 --> 57:47.120
So you tell me, Wes, what the hell is going on right now?

57:47.120 --> 57:49.480
It's the future, and I like it.

57:49.480 --> 57:50.680
I guess?

57:50.680 --> 57:54.400
So why am I sort of worried about all of those individually?

57:54.400 --> 57:57.760
Like, all together, this feels like, yay, Linux.

57:57.760 --> 57:59.800
But individually, each one of them

57:59.800 --> 58:01.880
is freaking me out for different reasons.

58:01.880 --> 58:03.720
I mean, it's a little bit like, you know,

58:03.720 --> 58:06.120
there's some FOMO, there's some sort of concern

58:06.120 --> 58:08.560
of just like, this thing's going in a lot of different ways.

58:08.560 --> 58:09.920
How consistent is the experience

58:09.920 --> 58:11.240
going to be across these?

58:11.240 --> 58:13.320
What sort of idea will new users who

58:13.320 --> 58:15.080
are using that form of, quote unquote,

58:15.080 --> 58:18.720
Linux really get about the wider Linux software

58:18.720 --> 58:20.440
ecosystem and community?

58:20.440 --> 58:21.160
I don't know.

58:21.160 --> 58:23.000
It's so early, I feel like we don't really

58:23.000 --> 58:24.040
know which ones are going to win,

58:24.040 --> 58:25.120
which ones are going to be successful,

58:25.120 --> 58:26.440
and how it's all going to shake out.

58:26.440 --> 58:28.240
Yeah, and like TechMav says, maybe I'm

58:28.240 --> 58:30.480
worried that we're putting the penguins in the zoo.

58:30.480 --> 58:31.880
That might be exactly what it is,

58:31.880 --> 58:36.920
is that instead of having this general technology platform OS,

58:36.920 --> 58:38.320
it's like this feature.

58:38.320 --> 58:40.000
It's like this, it's this bullet point

58:40.000 --> 58:44.000
on top of these proprietary commercial products.

58:44.000 --> 58:50.840
Poby had a great conversation in the last week Ubuntu podcast

58:50.840 --> 58:53.720
that was basically, has Linux sort of failed

58:53.720 --> 58:56.280
to attract desktop applications?

58:56.280 --> 58:58.440
Instead, we get Electron and whatnot.

58:58.440 --> 59:00.800
But at the same time, you see all these companies that

59:00.800 --> 59:03.280
are trying to add compatibility for Linux applications,

59:03.280 --> 59:07.560
and it's not just command line applications.

59:07.560 --> 59:09.960
Poby, what do you think about that?

59:09.960 --> 59:12.080
So I'll just encourage people to go

59:12.080 --> 59:14.480
listen to the last Ubuntu podcast to hear your argument.

59:14.480 --> 59:17.480
But you make a very salient argument

59:17.480 --> 59:20.120
that perhaps we're looking at sort of a future

59:20.120 --> 59:21.640
that none of us wanted.

59:21.640 --> 59:23.360
And we have a lot of Linux installs,

59:23.360 --> 59:25.040
but we don't have anybody that's really

59:25.040 --> 59:27.160
got a successful Linux application

59:27.160 --> 59:29.080
toolkit or desktop toolkit.

59:29.080 --> 59:31.360
But yet, at the same time, you've got Chromebooks,

59:31.360 --> 59:34.160
you've got the subsystem for Linux, which I guarantee you

59:34.160 --> 59:37.840
will soon have desktop Linux support apps.

59:37.840 --> 59:40.000
You have Samsung.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.240
How do you square those two things?

59:42.240 --> 59:43.720
We're quite a niche.

59:43.720 --> 59:50.400
Like, if Linux is like the flea on a dog,

59:50.400 --> 59:51.680
we're bacteria on the flea.

59:51.680 --> 59:52.720
Like, we're nothing.

59:52.720 --> 59:55.040
Like, you compare us to what everyone else

59:55.040 --> 59:59.120
is using around the world, and this significant majority

59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.400
don't even know what Linux is, let alone use it.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.480
And so developers don't target it, because it's just

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:04.880
not worth it.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.880
You hear time and time again that many developers

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.840
don't target Linux, because it's not worth it,

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.920
because the time investment doesn't pay back.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.680
If they release a game, the amount of time

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:18.640
and effort to port that game is not repaid.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.640
And so that's why you see articles by Liam

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:24.680
on gaming on Linux celebrating when someone does do that,

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.240
because it's so rare, so few and far between.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:29.920
It's like, if someone announced a new game for Windows,

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.880
it's like, well, yeah, always.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.480
There's always new games for Windows.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:40.160
But we clutch at these successful events here and there.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.320
But they are few and far between.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.160
And yeah, we have, in some ways, lost.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.400
I mean, I think, by and large, lost in that sense is accurate.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:55.560
And we probably won't ever see mainstream adoption

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:58.320
of the Linux experience that we know and love,

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:01.400
that the people listening to the show, by and large, enjoy.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.200
I'm grateful in some sense that Electron, those sorts of things

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.360
that aren't Linux special, but end up working on Linux.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.000
We've seen more adoption in the case of,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.800
I feel like I can use my specialty system,

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.200
acknowledging that I'm in a niche,

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.120
that I'm doing it in a strange way to most people,

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.600
but actually get work done, mostly

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.400
be compatible with the rest of the world.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:23.000
I do think, though, that there's not a lot of chance

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.600
that maybe your relatives will be using Linux,

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.440
and you won't have to be the IT guy,

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.840
but it won't be the Linux that you know or are

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:31.680
familiar with.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.400
I feel like I was a bit of a Debbie Downer in that episode.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.560
And we had a lot of feedback from people saying, well,

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.360
it depends how you define success.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:42.120
There's still millions of people using Linux,

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:46.000
both in servers and billions using it on their phones.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.320
But on the desktop specifically, I

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:53.160
think we're far from what you would call massively successful.

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:53.800
Definitely.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.040
Compared to the others.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.040
And we've been doing this for a long time now.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.720
I think the experience has gotten better, right?

01:01:58.720 --> 01:01:59.600
It's pretty consistent.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.240
I just converted some of my family over to 1804,

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.600
and they're using Steam on it and having a great time.

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.560
But we just haven't made any inroads

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.000
in the default deployments, in any kind of marketing.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.040
And don't get me wrong.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:10.400
I love it.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:10.640
Right.

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.360
Yeah, of course.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.960
And I want to spread the word, and I

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.360
want more people to use it.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.680
But we need to attract developers

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.580
to build software for our platform,

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:19.200
or people aren't going to use our platform.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.680
Nobody switched to Linux for G-Edit.

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:25.400
Nobody switched to Linux for your GNOME calculator.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.940
You've got to have that killer app.

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.800
You've got to have some reason for people to switch.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.040
Some people switch for freedom.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.400
Some people switch because resource management.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.480
Some people switch for the privacy, right?

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:38.520
But there's very few killer apps that make people think, yes,

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.520
I definitely today want to install Linux,

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.880
whereas someone will actively go and buy

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:46.520
a Mac for software that is only available on the Mac.

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.880
And people will install Windows specifically

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.760
for a piece of software that is only available on Windows.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:52.720
And we don't have that.

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:52.920
Right.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.160
And we don't have a big brand anymore, really.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.640
You know, there isn't someone, a big marketing organization,

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.920
isn't some sort of company.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.600
We have pieces here and there.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.440
But there's not, you know, we don't have a,

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.560
a bunch of us the closest.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:05.400
And maybe that can be rekindled.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.440
But with some, you know, there's feelings

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.960
of not having much focus in that area.

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:11.880
Or less focus there feels even farther away, maybe.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.520
Right.

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.200
Yeah.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:13.960
Yeah.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:16.560
You know, though, we do win on one level.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:19.280
And that is the Fiddly experience.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.800
If you get the right system.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.400
I've been recently listening to fellow podcaster Mike Hurley

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.440
go through the process of setting up a Windows 10 gaming

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.200
system.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:32.440
Now he, Mike, is a Mac guy.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:36.040
Through and through, he loves Macs and iPads

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.120
and all that kind of stuff.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:41.040
And so he never really built a Windows PC in his life.

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:44.080
And he never had to deal with device drivers,

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.400
never had to deal with different vendors making

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.360
different components for his PC.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.200
And so for the last two weeks, he

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.760
has been dealing with driver hell.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:55.640
Like he needed to get his Tascam recorder

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.560
so he can do podcasting and live streaming working.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.040
And when he did that, it broke his Bluetooth driver.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.800
And then when he fixed his Bluetooth driver,

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.480
it broke SLI on his video gaming setup.

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:09.200
And then when he fixed the SLI setup, it caused another issue.

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:12.480
And this is a brand new system that he just put together.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:15.920
And all of this Fiddliness that he has to do

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.040
is something you don't really screw around with.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.520
On Linux, you may have to deal with a binary blob

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.240
for your video card here and there.

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.600
But for the most part, everything,

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.160
if it's going to work, it just works.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.600
You're not dealing with drivers.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.720
You're not dealing with all these separate sources

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:30.800
to get stuff.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:34.880
I think we have lost sight of how easy

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.400
Linux makes some of this stuff.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:41.000
And I say that because I was going over

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.440
setting up a new broadcasting system based

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.240
on Linux for Linux Academy.

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:49.800
And man, is it so much easier when the bullet point

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:53.280
to getting the whole OS and all of your device drivers working

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:56.120
is install Kubuntu 18.04.

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:56.960
That's it, right?

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.880
But done.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.360
Exactly, you're done.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.200
You don't have to mess with anything else.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.080
You install Kubuntu 18.04.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.680
That's a good argument for why a lot of people

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:08.680
moved away from Linux to things like the maker community.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:11.400
Because it was fun and interesting

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.080
when you had to, to some degree, for some people,

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:17.360
to edit your xorg.conf and make sure the right daemons were

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.440
starting when you start up.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.640
And I know a lot of Arch users still do that and still

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.160
find that interesting and fun.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.120
I don't, and the vast majority of people don't.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.880
They just want to put an ISO image on a CD,

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:29.200
boot that CD or USB, install it, and then move on.

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.160
And I think a lot of enthusiasts move on

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.840
from the Linux community because that's not fun anymore.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.320
You could just install the OS and then use it as a tool.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:40.160
Now people are doing things like Arduinos and microcontrollers

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.760
and 3D printers and stuff like that which are more interesting

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.080
because they are challenging.

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.040
And they don't work straight away.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.600
And it's not like putting a USB key in and it just works.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.800
There's a lot of fiddling and feckling to do.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.640
So I think we've lost some of that.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.680
We're victims of our own success.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.440
Try out SUSE.

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.680
It's just like that.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:58.180
Yeah.

01:05:58.180 --> 01:05:58.680
Oosh.

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:01.720
You're in a mood today.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.400
I just kid because every time I apparently say something,

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.720
it triggers Richard and he has to tweet me about it

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.160
because I give him a hard time for it

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.520
asked me to confirm my network configuration and card

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.360
and probe by FireWare devices on LAN.

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.280
And so he gave me a tweet about it.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.440
But I tease.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.520
Yeah, I agree, Poby.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.320
Maybe you're right.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.360
Maybe that is why some people are moving away.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:26.080
But I don't feel it as somebody who

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.520
has been trying to make Linux work on my desktop

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.240
since long before it was appropriate to do so.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.800
And I don't know why my employers let me get away with it

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:36.080
to now where it's what I make my living doing.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.880
And I got to tell you, as somebody who is using it now,

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.640
it is so much easier than it used to be.

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:43.040
It is ridiculous.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.600
I am doing this live show, this entire freaking live show

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:51.080
from Grants Pass, Oregon in this stinky tiny hotel room

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:52.920
all on Linux end to end.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.640
Even in the studio, the machines that

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.640
are doing all the routing and the recording

01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:00.280
and the processing and all of it, everything, even the mixer

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.720
is Linux from end to end.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.600
And that would not have been the case a couple of years ago.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.100
Right.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:09.920
And we're victims of our own success there.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:12.360
It's got to the point where you can do a live stream

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.280
and you could take your show on the road and everything works.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.480
Like, why would you need nerds around you to help you fix it?

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.920
Because it all works now.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.420
Yeah, that's good and bad, isn't it?

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:24.920
I mean, it's good for getting to a larger consumer base.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:28.280
And my big drive for always trying

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.960
to get wider user adoption has always

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.200
been for wider application support.

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.440
I just, for some really naive reason,

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.480
thought it would be native application support.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:37.480
I don't know what it was.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:37.980
Right.

01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:40.760
I think a lot of us did, and we were wrong.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:42.480
Yeah, I did not expect this.

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:45.680
But along those lines, I also didn't expect this to happen.

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:48.220
And it is actually happening.

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:51.280
If I say the name RED when it comes to media production,

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.920
I think a lot of you would immediately

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:58.400
think of those really high end, beautiful RED 8K cameras.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.480
And the thing about those RED cameras

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:04.000
is that they are a beast onto their own.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.520
They have their own proprietary capture hardware

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.320
to pull that stuff down.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.240
They have their own raw format.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.720
And I say raw because it's not quite raw.

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.280
Like, when I think of raw, I think of raw data.

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.640
When they think of raw, they think of a tool

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.200
that you need to re-encode that to make

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.880
it readable by anything else.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:26.000
And that has only been available on the Mac and on Windows,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.040
except for today.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:31.240
Today, RED is releasing their REDLINE tool

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:34.300
and their RED Undead tool, which are

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:35.920
two different utilities for managing

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:39.840
footage that has been recorded on a RED 8K camera.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.440
They're releasing them for Linux.

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:44.240
And they're native Linux applications.

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.200
They're not perfect.

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.720
I don't have a RED camera to test,

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.920
so I just downloaded the applications and ran them.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:54.200
I didn't have any footage to import.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:57.960
But they support export to what I

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:03.640
consider to be really high end, intermediate exchange formats.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:07.880
Much like how when you're moving an audio file or a picture

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:10.600
between editing and you don't want to keep recompressing it,

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.820
like to JPEG or whatever or to MP3,

01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:15.680
you have that same issue with video.

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:19.040
And so a lot of times, editors use something like ProRes,

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.880
MJPEG, or a bunch of other stuff.

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:25.440
And their Linux version of this RED utility

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:29.200
is going to support a lot of those, including Apple's ProRes.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:32.120
So that way, you can download footage on a Linux box,

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:36.040
and you can convert it to ProRes on a Linux box.

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.080
Wow.

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.200
That's a big deal, I think.

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.740
And yeah, I don't know why RED's doing this,

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:43.000
but I think that is a really good sign.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.460
I wonder if there's just less, there's

01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:47.160
already a lot of Linux deployed at the higher end production

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:47.800
studios.

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:49.840
Is it just it makes their pipeline simpler

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.200
if they don't have to include some other things?

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.240
They can get this streamed up and then, sure,

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.480
the ProRes ends up on some Mac where they maybe

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:58.880
edit it down the line, but keeps it a little simpler.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:02.360
It is kind of funny if you look at their website,

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:06.080
even it says red line Linux and then beta, of course.

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:09.600
But at the bottom, they still have the Mac and Windows logo

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:12.080
for the release.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.280
Yeah, it's new.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.560
It just launched today.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:15.920
The site's not totally done yet.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.000
Hey, I noticed that, too.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.600
It's like, so am I getting a Linux version?

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.560
Or am I getting this?

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.480
Yeah, what is it?

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.080
But when you download it, it is 100% a Linux application.

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:27.120
It's in a tar.gz and everything.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.440
Yeah, it's full GNU slash.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.680
All right, so let's talk about some new hardware.

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.520
We were talking last week about the best Linux laptop for 2018.

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.680
We got a whole bunch of feedback.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:40.080
And to kind of kick this new segment off,

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:43.580
we have a batch of new hardware from Dell, thinner, lighter,

01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:46.000
and more powerful, all things that are good.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.560
And we have a whole new line.

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:56.840
You have the 3530 and also the 5530, the 7530, and the 7730.

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:57.600
Beefy.

01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:58.920
Yeah.

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.280
Barton George, friend of the show, Barton George,

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:04.200
says these systems, which represent the fourth generation

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:07.440
of Precision Developer Editions, come preloaded with Ubuntu

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.360
and also have been certified for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:13.960
Now, this is on top of the XPS 13 that is already available.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:17.720
The Precision 3530 is the first one that is available.

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:20.960
Its starting price is $943.

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:25.440
That'll get you a 15.6 inch 1366 by 768.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.200
Ugh.

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:26.880
Yeah.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:27.600
Don't say it.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.600
Just don't even say it.

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.280
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have even said it.

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:36.320
Four gigs of RAM and an Intel i5.

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:42.920
So don't get the $943 model, unless you have to.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.560
But as with all Dells, you can configure it way up from there.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.720
There's also going to be the other models I mentioned,

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:54.760
the 5530, 7530, and 7730, we'll be shipping later,

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:58.680
with 1604 installed on all of them.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:04.360
And eighth gen Intel processors, all those goodies.

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.000
All the typical goodies that you would

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.200
get in the latest bump of Dell or any kind of recent laptop

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.120
hardware.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:14.080
So yeah, as we're about to open up this segment here

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.240
on the show, you have a whole new batch

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.100
of laptops you could potentially buy.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.800
So get your credit cards ready.

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.640
Those Precision machines are pretty slick, too.

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:25.440
I used the older, back when it was the bigger, uglier

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:28.240
chassis of the previous generation, for a long time.

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:31.720
And they're just sturdy, really a good desktop replacement,

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.140
if that's what you need it for.

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:36.400
So now that they look a lot nicer, I'm kind of interested.

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.760
Yeah, and it's always nice to see them just getting

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.720
another spec bump, just to keep seeing, really what's nice,

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:44.240
actually, is to keep seeing Dell keep working at this,

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.520
just keep iterating on this.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.600
Yeah, it's more Linux momentum.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.400
And it's paid off.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.160
So we sent out the vote last episode.

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.240
And what I have found over the years

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:55.860
is we may have thousands of you download this,

01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:57.360
tens of thousands of you download this,

01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:00.480
but only a few hundred of you ever really vote on these polls.

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:03.520
But anywhere between a couple of hundred and a thousand,

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.600
it almost always shakes out to be the same.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.600
And I guess that's just the way that the math works.

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:12.240
So let's start with what didn't do well and what did well.

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.120
Last week, we asked the audience,

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:18.920
what is the best Linux laptop on this list for 2018?

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.480
We had the Oryx Pro on there.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:25.800
We had the ThinkPad X270 and 280, the X1 Carbon,

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.560
the Librem 15, and the XPS 13.

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:30.440
And we asked you guys, what do you think is,

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.820
if you were going to buy one today,

01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:34.000
which laptop would you buy?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.560
And I also said, whichever laptop doesn't win the vote

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.000
will just take off the list.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.360
And we won't be recommending that one to folks.

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:44.640
And the one that fell off the list this week,

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:47.920
I'm really kind of unsatisfied with.

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:48.920
It's really unfortunate.

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:52.400
And maybe it's partially my fault. The Librem 15

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:57.600
only got 5% of votes, 5% of votes.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.600
Yeah, it is a big ouch.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:04.680
And I don't know what's going on here.

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:07.560
I think there's a bigger problem that Purism is dealing with.

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:12.360
And it's this sort of outsider status that I feel like they

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.080
have.

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:14.760
I feel like people don't know about them,

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.420
and they don't think about them when they

01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:19.840
think of Linux-first hardware.

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.320
And I can't really put my finger on it.

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.880
I don't know if it's because they did crowdfunding,

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:27.240
or if it's because they're kind of going their own way

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.520
with PureOS.

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:30.400
I kind of have more of a sense it's that.

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.800
But what's your impression on that, Wes?

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.360
Do you feel like maybe they're not getting a fair shake?

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:39.440
Because you have a vendor here who is making hardware just

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.200
for Linux, physical kill switches.

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.040
It only ships Linux.

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:45.160
And it is the bottom of our list.

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.960
You know, it might just be a weird subset of people

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:50.520
that are kind of interested in this.

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.680
They're not always bargain-basement.

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:54.920
So if you're on a budget, they're not super expensive.

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.640
Then that's not necessarily an Apple tax.

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:59.280
But it's a little bit more over like a minimal XPS

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.640
or something like that.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:04.000
And I think some of these pre-installed or super

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.920
customized strange distributions are

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:08.440
off-putting to experienced users that feel that they're

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.880
going to have to flash it anyway.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:13.240
And maybe you just want some, to quote Pope,

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.840
bog-standard hardware that you're

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:18.040
going to install your own distribution on anyway.

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:20.040
And then for people that would benefit more

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:21.640
from a pre-installed Linux that don't want

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.760
them to mess with it so much, they probably

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.920
haven't heard of them.

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.640
I mean, there has been a kind of bumpy track record, too.

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:30.640
I know their most recent Librem 15 is a nice piece of hardware.

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:33.140
But I don't know if they've just had enough of a track record

01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:35.400
now in the good for people to have a lot of trust

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.840
in an expensive purchase.

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.720
Yeah, that's also a good point.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.160
Good points, Wes, all in all.

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.520
Mumbler, do you have anything to add?

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.920
Why do you think it is that purism

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:44.080
isn't higher up on our list?

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:48.740
And why isn't a Librem 15 or 13 more forward from Linux users

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:50.640
when they want to buy a Linux-first laptop?

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.560
I think if you have a support problem,

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:56.520
you would like an established company, maybe.

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.200
Also, maybe the keyboard.

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:01.280
Let's say you have some worldwide audition.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:06.800
And here in Switzerland, I cannot buy a Librem laptop

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:09.200
because of the missing keyboard for Switzerland.

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:10.820
Yeah, I mean, definitely international

01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:13.640
is a problem that is hard for a company like Purism that's just

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:14.760
getting started to address.

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:17.160
But it does seem like a deeper issue.

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:18.860
I'd like to know the audience's thoughts,

01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:21.120
because honestly, I feel like they maybe deserve a little

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.500
more credit than they're getting.

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:25.480
I was skeptical when I got my Librem 15, the original one,

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.120
and it wasn't what I wanted.

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:30.640
But when they did a make good and they sent me

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:34.000
a second or third iteration on the Librem 15,

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.880
it was a marked improvement in quality.

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:39.240
I could easily see where the trend line was going.

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:41.800
And it's not just me that said that.

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.320
When we have guests in the studio,

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:45.320
besides Wes, because Wes brings his own hardware,

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:47.280
and we have guests in the studio,

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.380
I give them the Librem 15 to use.

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:52.160
And people constantly remark on how nice the machine is.

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.360
And when Noah was in town, he sat down.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.160
He's like, really?

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:56.400
This is the Librem 15?

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.680
This is way nicer than I thought it would be.

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:01.160
And a lot of people comment on how great the keyboard is,

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:05.760
and the design looks great, the performance is good.

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:08.920
And it really is the big loser on our list.

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.640
And I don't really understand, because the number two

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.560
on our list is the Oryx Pro.

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:17.520
Well, these are the only two systems on our list

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.420
that are created by vendors that only make stuff for Linux,

01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:24.640
that only ship Linux, System76 and the Librem 15.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.200
That with the System76, you could have put the Galego Pro.

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.400
We decided to put the Oryx Pro,

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.880
because we were going for something a little high more.

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:32.040
It was brand new and high performance.

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:38.040
But still, the fact that ThinkPads and the XPS

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.720
are dominating this list, I think is telling.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:44.840
And so the XPS 13 is the one that was the clear winner.

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:47.060
44% of the votes.

01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:51.920
The number two was the X1 Carbon with 20% of the votes.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:55.240
And then the number three was the X270

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:57.160
with 17% of the votes.

01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:59.800
So the Carbon and the X270 were the closest.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:02.960
Then it drops down to the Oryx Pro at 15%,

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:07.960
and then the Librem 15 at 5%.

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:08.920
It's devastating.

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:10.880
And it, again, gives me concern

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.440
about how the Librem 5 is going to do.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.720
So these are bad numbers for the vendors

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:17.360
that ship only Linux systems.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:20.640
And I can't explain it, to be honest with you,

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:24.680
because if everything I hear is consistent,

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:27.400
people want companies that are making computers

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:28.600
for Linux first.

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.560
But then when you look at the actual numbers in our polls,

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:35.240
or you go to any kind of conference or event,

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:39.880
and it's stacked full of MacBooks, ThinkPads,

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:41.520
and then Dells, that's the three.

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:44.120
And then the fourth would be maybe an HP.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.360
And then the fifth is like a mix of Chromebooks.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.760
That's what you get when you go to these events.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.600
I don't know what to make of that.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.240
Anybody in the Mumba room have additional thoughts

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:56.700
on why these Linux-only vendors are not doing super well

01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:58.520
in our Linux user poll?

01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:01.320
Well, I would have to say that there's also

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.360
the original premise of purism was,

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.640
well, I think the premise still is like

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:09.920
to be privacy-focused, and that sort of marketing

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.880
sort of alienates people on occasion.

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.920
I suppose if you're not marketing for the other factors,

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:18.200
because it's not like some of the privacy features

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.120
don't really detract from the rest of the system,

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.180
but if all you're hearing is,

01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:22.860
oh, this is all about privacy, these are the features,

01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:25.040
this is what makes us great, and less about,

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.320
this is why this would just be a good laptop for you,

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.800
then yeah, maybe you're less interested.

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:32.840
I mean, and also a lot of the Linux laptop brands

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.440
are based in Europe, and they don't have a foothold

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:38.520
in the United States yet,

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:41.920
so I don't see any sort of competition.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.320
I know the Sputnik program at Dell

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:45.520
is sort of an initiative,

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.760
but is there really enough competition

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:52.400
in order to get Linux-based laptops

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.960
into a market of their own?

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.120
Bobby, do you have any thoughts?

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:59.800
I've not actually seen a Librem laptop,

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:01.440
but they've sent us one for review.

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:04.680
So very soon now, Mark has it,

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:06.480
and we'll be comparing,

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:08.960
because I believe the one we've got

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.280
is the same hard physical hardware

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:15.560
as the KDE Slimbook 2 that I've got for review.

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.800
So interestingly, we'll be able to compare and contrast,

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:21.080
and decide whether, you know, should you buy the Purism,

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:23.240
or should you buy the KDE Slimbook?

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:26.540
Well, interesting, and I look forward to hearing that.

01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:28.780
But, you know, the votes have it.

01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:30.920
We'll take the Librem 15 off the list,

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:34.700
and we'll have our list of our recommended laptops

01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:36.420
for 2018, at least.

01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:40.840
And maybe the Librem 15 gets back on there for 2019.

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.320
But Dom emailed in, by the way,

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.240
he emailed us in at linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:48.160
He said, I have a couple of recommendations,

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.680
depending on which laptop you get.

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.740
So if you're gonna get the XPS 13,

01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:53.000
they have two different models

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.360
that they're selling right now,

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.360
the 9360 and the 9370.

01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:58.740
And you'll notice this immediately

01:20:58.740 --> 01:20:59.840
if you start doing research.

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:01.900
There's these two different models out there.

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:04.760
Dell is selling both of those models

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.780
with upgraded eighth-gen processors.

01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:11.580
The 9370 is slimmer, but it embraces the dongle lifestyle.

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:16.440
And the 9370 has a better screen,

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:19.800
and it's like, that's really saying something,

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:20.800
because the screen before it was already

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:22.280
like one of the best ever.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:25.160
Now, Dom suggests you don't buy the Linux version.

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.680
Now, you might wanna double check this,

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.420
depending on when you listen to this episode.

01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:30.840
He says, currently, the Linux version

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:33.800
still has the seventh-gen Intel processor.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:37.040
He recommends, get the Windows version of the laptop,

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:40.880
but switch out the killer wireless card for an Intel card

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.520
for better Linux support.

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:45.240
Get a 1080p screen for better battery life.

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:47.720
And also, remember that you're not gonna be able

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:48.660
to upgrade the RAM later,

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:50.520
so keep that in mind when you're speccing it.

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:54.260
The 9360 has a full side SD card.

01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:57.380
The 9370 only has micro SD.

01:21:57.380 --> 01:22:01.680
The 9360 has a larger battery than the 9370,

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.360
but the 9370 is just slimmer in general.

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:08.280
When you're looking at the X270 or X1 Carbon models,

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:11.920
maybe consider just skipping the X280 right now.

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:14.300
Lenovo went kind of MacBook Air on that one,

01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:17.000
and they removed all of the features that made it great,

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.800
including soldering some stuff on.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:22.700
So, consider if you're gonna go with the X270 or 280 line,

01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:25.640
focus maybe more on the X270 for now,

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.100
and remember, you're gonna need an Ethernet dongle

01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:28.940
with that one.

01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:30.960
But the XPS 13 was our champion.

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:33.400
It was the winning laptop for the poll.

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:36.080
So, just look at this list, we'll have it linked.

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:38.060
Dom's gonna suggest that you consider looking

01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:43.060
at the 93060 versus the 93070, depending on your needs.

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:47.880
For me personally, I might still wanna go with the 93060,

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:50.720
because it's got the eighth generation Intel processor,

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.760
and it's got the larger battery life,

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:55.000
and it uses less dongles.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.680
It just has a downgrade on the screen.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.200
Right, and it's already pretty slim.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.960
Like, they're not fat laptops.

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.840
Right, yeah, it's still very, very thin.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:03.800
Very nice laptop.

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:05.400
I mean, I have an older one that's from that,

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:08.080
and it's still very thin and very nice.

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.200
All right, I think we're done with the laptops.

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.040
I don't know, I don't know.

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.660
Hopefully this show wasn't horrible, Wes.

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:15.300
I feel like it could've been a little stronger,

01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:16.140
could've been a little better

01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:18.920
if I wasn't running around town beforehand,

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.660
trying to find internet.

01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:22.560
You did have that Levi story, though.

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:24.680
That always pulls it out, even though he's not feeling well.

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:26.640
We're all glad to hear he's feeling better.

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:29.920
And you know, Wes, really, it was for me this week.

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:31.800
It was for me just to be able to do this

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:35.000
and talk to you guys and not have everything in my life

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.320
be totally crazy right now.

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:38.200
So hopefully the audience loved it.

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:40.500
I don't think so, but hopefully a couple people

01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:41.400
out there liked it.

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:43.720
Let us know, and also let us know your thoughts

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:45.840
on the laptops, Linux Action.

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:47.640
No, nope, nope, it's not Linux.

01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:51.240
Although you can go there, it's linuxunplug.com slash contact.

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:52.700
You can, you sure could.

01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:53.780
I don't know.

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:55.900
If you wanna let us know over at Linux Action News

01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:58.580
what you think, you can go to linuxactionnews.com

01:23:58.580 --> 01:23:59.780
slash contact.

01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:02.620
It's the same URL, just not the same URL,

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:03.900
it's a different show.

01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:04.740
I don't know, Wes.

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:06.620
I think it's just totally gone off the rails at this point.

01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:08.160
We should probably wrap it up.

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:11.180
But I'll leave Dom's email in the show notes

01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:12.720
if you guys wanna go through his list,

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:14.180
because I know I just went through the highlights,

01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:15.700
and all the other things we talked about

01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:17.820
at linuxunplug.com slash 251.

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:19.540
Go check it all out there.

01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:21.180
Mr. Payne, where can they get more of you?

01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:23.420
You can find me on Twitter, at Wes Payne,

01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:25.620
or go to TechSnap.Systems to check out

01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:27.100
our other wonderful show.

01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:29.840
Yeah, so go get more Wes and me at TechSnap.Systems.

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.020
I'm at Chris LAS.

01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:33.500
I'll be tweeting some updates along the way.

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:36.300
And the whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:38.020
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode

01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:39.380
of the Unplugged program,

01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:41.620
and we'll see you back here next Tuesday!

01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:51.540
MEDIAH

01:24:51.540 --> 01:25:18.500
Alright, let's uh, before we get out of here guys, thank you everybody, Momba Room, thank

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:22.340
you very much for putting up with all of that. I know that was difficult and challenging, so I

01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:27.300
really appreciate you guys being here. Thank you guys. Go vote, people who are still around. We do

01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:36.500
have, J-Bot seems to be alive today. Yeah, J-Bot. J-Bot survives, yeah. I tell you what, this day,

01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:41.140
the one thing I, the one thing I didn't get a chance to say, uh, because I just, I was sick

01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:45.700
of derailing the show, but while I'm sitting here during the last few minutes of the show,

01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:50.900
I saw somebody go by, he's wearing a motorcycle helmet, no shirt, and then I think he's wearing

01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:56.500
pants, I couldn't quite tell, and he was sitting outside the sunroof of a Suburban,

01:25:56.500 --> 01:26:01.220
and they were going down the road. So to make it clear, this guy was sitting on top of a Suburban,

01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:05.380
outside the sunroof, with no shirt on, wearing a motorcycle helmet, going down the road in front

01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:09.220
of this motel room. Well, at least he's thinking, you know, about safety first. That's the only way

01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:39.220
to get a good tan when you're on the road.
