00:00.000 --> 00:03.800
I learned something new about both of you this week.

00:03.800 --> 00:04.800
Really?

00:04.800 --> 00:11.200
I learned that Brent is in denial about rats in his walls, and I learned that you must

00:11.200 --> 00:12.200
have a new monitor.

00:12.200 --> 00:15.160
I have yet to confirm it, but I think you are now rocking the multi-monitor lifestyle.

00:15.160 --> 00:16.160
Am I right?

00:16.160 --> 00:17.840
Oh, I was already multi-monitor.

00:17.840 --> 00:22.080
I'm just more multi-monitor as I slowly piece together a better office environment.

00:22.080 --> 00:26.360
Well, I can attest your productivity seems to have increased.

00:26.360 --> 00:30.520
You are preemptively responding to messages now.

00:30.520 --> 00:36.240
I tell you what, I don't know how recently you turned it on, but there was one day where

00:36.240 --> 00:41.440
three times in a row you responded to a message before I or Hadeah finished writing the message,

00:41.440 --> 00:45.520
and I'm like, West must have a new monitor.

00:45.520 --> 00:59.760
Or I'm living a little bit in the future.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.760
Well hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:03.760 --> 01:04.760
My name is Chris.

01:04.760 --> 01:05.760
My name is Wes.

01:05.760 --> 01:06.760
And my name is Brent.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.720
Hello you handsome gentlemen coming up on the show today.

01:09.720 --> 01:14.860
It might be hard to believe, but there is some data that shows that as Linux grows,

01:14.860 --> 01:16.120
so does its malware problem.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.280
No, don't worry.

01:17.280 --> 01:21.920
Today we're actually taking a look at some work that's been going on on the down low

01:21.920 --> 01:25.560
in Mac OS to respond to a growing malware problem over there.

01:25.560 --> 01:30.160
So we're going to use that lens to see if maybe there's a precautionary tale for Linux

01:30.160 --> 01:32.600
users as we reach mass adoption.

01:32.600 --> 01:37.040
Plus, we're going to take a look at the old days of Linux that are new again, then we'll

01:37.040 --> 01:40.520
round out the show with some boosts and picks and more.

01:40.520 --> 01:44.280
So before we go any further, let's say time appropriate greetings to that virtual lug.

01:44.280 --> 01:45.280
Hello mumble room.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.280
Hello Chris.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.280
Hi Brent.

01:47.280 --> 01:48.280
Hi Wes.

01:48.280 --> 01:49.280
Hello.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.280
Hello everybody.

01:50.280 --> 01:53.760
And hello to everybody up there in the quiet listening as well.

01:53.760 --> 01:54.760
Thank you for joining us.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.280
Good morning to all of you.

01:56.280 --> 01:59.640
We are doing this over at Jupiter.tube on Sunday.

01:59.640 --> 02:04.000
This is our second to last regular episode in studio before the road trip.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.280
Then things are going to get crazy.

02:05.280 --> 02:08.400
So why not catch one over at Jupiter.tube next Sunday.

02:08.400 --> 02:12.220
Also a big good morning to our friends over at TailScale.

02:12.220 --> 02:17.040
TailScale is a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard's noise protocol.

02:17.040 --> 02:23.120
You can build yourself a flat mesh network that's all WireGuarded up and it is a thing

02:23.120 --> 02:24.120
of beauty.

02:24.120 --> 02:25.680
It works across all your devices.

02:25.680 --> 02:30.960
So go say good morning and try it out for free for 20 devices when you go to TailScale.com.

02:30.960 --> 02:36.440
And I don't know, tell them Lop sent you the unplugged program, would you?

02:36.440 --> 02:39.880
Okay guys, can we get a little nostalgic?

02:39.880 --> 02:43.640
All of us at some point, I believe on the show have used Unity back in its heyday.

02:43.640 --> 02:44.640
Of course.

02:44.640 --> 02:45.640
Oh yeah.

02:45.640 --> 02:49.040
And it was a little sad to see Unity go, but it seemed like, you know, if they were going

02:49.040 --> 02:52.920
to, if Ubuntu was going to make the switch over to GNOME, this was the route things needed

02:52.920 --> 02:53.920
to go.

02:53.920 --> 02:55.280
And we had some positives too, right?

02:55.280 --> 03:00.000
We were hopeful that some of those extra canonical contributions more focused at GNOME would

03:00.000 --> 03:01.200
be a wide benefit.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.400
I think we've seen that.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.660
I think that's played out.

03:03.660 --> 03:05.400
I think GNOME is better off.

03:05.400 --> 03:11.440
Well as is one to happen in the Linux community, somebody decided to up and fork Unity and

03:11.440 --> 03:13.480
they created the Ubuntu Unity Remix.

03:13.480 --> 03:14.640
We've looked at it from time to time.

03:14.640 --> 03:20.880
We haven't talked about it too much, but this week it caught our attention when it appears

03:20.880 --> 03:27.400
that starting with Ubuntu 22.10 in late October, Canonical is going to recognize the Unity

03:27.400 --> 03:31.180
Remix as an official flavor of Ubuntu.

03:31.180 --> 03:33.800
So this means there are certain things you can expect that's going to participate in

03:33.800 --> 03:34.800
the beta processes.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.520
It's going to have certain applications.

03:36.520 --> 03:40.840
It's going to have snap support and it's now going to be part of the Canonical release

03:40.840 --> 03:41.840
infrastructure.

03:41.840 --> 03:47.000
Hello Brent, were you surprised to see this happen since this is sort of a very backwards

03:47.000 --> 03:52.800
looking desktop environment in some sense, but yet clearly has its fans, right?

03:52.800 --> 03:59.360
Yeah, I was surprised actually that Canonical is now taking it under the wing in a sense

03:59.360 --> 04:00.840
and also quite happy about it.

04:00.840 --> 04:06.520
I think the other flavors have been great, but it sort of makes sense for Unity to come

04:06.520 --> 04:08.040
back around full circle.

04:08.040 --> 04:13.760
I wonder how that feels internally at Canonical to see a project that you've sort of for a

04:13.760 --> 04:18.920
variety of reasons abandoned a while ago, but I feel like there's been, I hope this

04:18.920 --> 04:23.760
is true, I feel like there's been good energy between the project and Canonical ever since

04:23.760 --> 04:27.600
it was forked and energy has been going into it, but I think this is great.

04:27.600 --> 04:32.920
I know a lot of people really love that desktop and seeing this now makes me kind of want

04:32.920 --> 04:36.440
to, Chris, I've been telling you that I might be wanting to try some different stuff, so

04:36.440 --> 04:39.400
maybe I'm going to give this a go.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.280
This feels like kind of tempting.

04:41.280 --> 04:45.560
I mean, maybe it's the new XFCE, Wes has got to be a little validating, I suppose, for

04:45.560 --> 04:49.640
the Canonical dev team because there's still user demand for something that they created.

04:49.640 --> 04:54.840
It does seem like just a real kind of sweet open source success story and just like this

04:54.840 --> 04:58.260
is something we talk about having the ability to do, even if it doesn't necessarily happen

04:58.260 --> 05:03.000
that often, but here's a case where some community was able to say, look, we were enjoying that,

05:03.000 --> 05:06.040
we get it, Canonical, you're going a different route, you don't want to allocate resources

05:06.040 --> 05:10.440
here, but we can step up and we can keep this thing going along because we're still getting

05:10.440 --> 05:11.560
value out of it.

05:11.560 --> 05:15.720
You know, as I use it, I got to say, a few things still hold up.

05:15.720 --> 05:18.300
They got that launcher with the search to launch.

05:18.300 --> 05:21.920
They were one of the first to that and it holds up.

05:21.920 --> 05:27.400
The layout where you have your top icons and your clock in the top right and then they

05:27.400 --> 05:31.400
have the one integrated bar where the menus and the minimize, maximize go all up in the

05:31.400 --> 05:32.400
top.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.400
It works.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.440
It works, especially on lower, smaller, tighter screens.

05:36.440 --> 05:40.320
A lot of the conventions still make sense.

05:40.320 --> 05:45.880
In fact, it's a lot of what I end up configuring a GNOME desktop for myself very frequently.

05:45.880 --> 05:48.000
It's like pretty close to that layout.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.800
I mean, they really got it.

05:49.800 --> 05:56.640
And one of the things that the Ubuntu Unity project is doing, ubuntuunity.org, is they're

05:56.640 --> 06:02.520
essentially, they're giving you the option to use Unity 7, which was the last like released

06:02.520 --> 06:06.560
version by Canonical, but they're upgrading components as they can.

06:06.560 --> 06:11.680
So the last version of Ubuntu that officially shipped with a Canonical developed version

06:11.680 --> 06:15.640
was in 16.04, but now they're offering it on modern Ubuntu basis.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.280
So you can get it with the most current Ubuntu release.

06:17.280 --> 06:21.880
Yeah, there was just like a huge release with the first release in six years back in June

06:21.880 --> 06:22.880
of this year.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.400
So it's like, oh, yeah, exciting days.

06:25.400 --> 06:28.360
Then they've done a couple of other things to modernize it.

06:28.360 --> 06:31.760
They've replaced the theme, obviously.

06:31.760 --> 06:36.120
They've included a tool called Unity tweak, which is great.

06:36.120 --> 06:41.880
I seem to recall it was available in Unity's past life, but it's really an essential tool.

06:41.880 --> 06:45.860
It's a really well laid out classic tool as well that lets you just modify things and

06:45.860 --> 06:49.240
make it more or less like a modern desktop, but you can go back to some of the older Unity

06:49.240 --> 06:52.280
themes if you want, or you can use the latest and greatest.

06:52.280 --> 06:56.160
And then something else they've done to kind of just bring it all together that I wanted

06:56.160 --> 07:02.860
to just note before we go on, is that they've mixed together a series of apps.

07:02.860 --> 07:06.320
So they have in here Terminal from GNOME 42.

07:06.320 --> 07:10.640
They've got the file manager is NEMO 5.24 for Mint.

07:10.640 --> 07:15.040
And the text editor is Pluma 1.26 for Mate, for example.

07:15.040 --> 07:19.200
So it's kind of like mixing modern tools in there from different places, sort of a best

07:19.200 --> 07:20.200
of breed.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.200
I like that.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.480
It feels like a kind of nice pragmatic approach, perhaps.

07:23.480 --> 07:24.760
I have a question, Chris.

07:24.760 --> 07:29.960
Do you have a sense at all in looking into this with how many developers are active in

07:29.960 --> 07:30.960
this project?

07:30.960 --> 07:31.960
You know, is it three people?

07:31.960 --> 07:32.960
Is it 30?

07:32.960 --> 07:33.960
Is it 300?

07:33.960 --> 07:34.960
I'd be curious.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.600
I know, I think it is about three.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.400
I did know, but I lost track of that.

07:39.400 --> 07:44.240
It's not a huge project, which I think is kind of why it's nice to see it get flavor

07:44.240 --> 07:47.440
status because they get some of that canonical infrastructure now.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.320
It's like, you know, the ISO download is not super quick.

07:50.320 --> 07:54.520
OK, another question I have then is, what does it take to become an official flavor?

07:54.520 --> 07:56.260
What's the bar that you need to match?

07:56.260 --> 07:57.260
Do we know?

07:57.260 --> 07:58.260
That's a great question.

07:58.260 --> 08:01.600
Yeah, so you can get a sense of that actually in the mailing list thread that we'll have

08:01.600 --> 08:02.840
linked in the show notes.

08:02.840 --> 08:07.540
But you know, reading through this mailing list thread, it seems certain like certain

08:07.540 --> 08:12.640
details like media applications like VLC versus Totem, there's some defaults that they want

08:12.640 --> 08:13.640
there.

08:13.640 --> 08:17.280
If you need to ship SNAP by default, that's another one of the requirements which they're

08:17.280 --> 08:18.560
doing.

08:18.560 --> 08:23.280
There is this sort of like minimum requirement to participating in the beta milestone releases

08:23.280 --> 08:27.120
along with the other Ubuntu releases that you also have to do that to be a flavor.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.120
It's an application process.

08:28.120 --> 08:32.280
And then several people vote on it to say, yes, we reviewed your case and it looks like

08:32.280 --> 08:36.720
you've met these baselines so you can now become an official flavor status.

08:36.720 --> 08:40.040
Once you do that, the work actually just kind of begins for the team because then they need

08:40.040 --> 08:43.160
to migrate a lot of their stuff over to the canonical infrastructure.

08:43.160 --> 08:45.440
Some of that's detailed in this mailing list too.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.120
It's interesting.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.720
It's interesting to see Unity coming back.

08:49.720 --> 08:57.360
My question that I had for me, was it Unity that was capable to display the menu in the

08:57.360 --> 09:00.000
top bar, the old menu?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.440
Yes, it still rocks it too.

09:02.440 --> 09:07.080
When you maximize the window, it goes all the way up and the file and the edit menu

09:07.080 --> 09:09.000
that goes up under the top bar.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.560
And I think the advantage of it is that you get more application real estate space.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.460
Everything looks a lot cleaner as well.

09:15.460 --> 09:19.920
The disadvantage is if you haven't used Unity in a while, it takes you a minute to remember

09:19.920 --> 09:21.160
that that stuff's up there.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.720
Wait, where are my menus?

09:22.720 --> 09:23.720
Yeah.

09:23.720 --> 09:27.200
So that was definitely a thing for me.

09:27.200 --> 09:33.720
Using it, it felt a little nostalgic and it also felt like I could see a world where if

09:33.720 --> 09:37.740
I had a workstation that didn't change much, I wanted something that was a kind of a modern

09:37.740 --> 09:41.320
looking desktop that had conventions that I like today because this is often how I set

09:41.320 --> 09:44.960
up Plasma and GNOME, I could see the logic in it.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.920
I really actually could because it's pretty low resource usage.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.200
It's pretty lightweight compared to modern desktops.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.200
Simple.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.720
You don't need to do a bunch of configuring, but you have some configuration options if

09:54.720 --> 09:55.720
you'd like to.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.720
Yeah.

09:56.720 --> 10:00.840
I mean, you're not going to be like getting a showcase of the latest GTK4 applications

10:00.840 --> 10:03.400
or a pure Wayland experience.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.160
That's not what's happening here.

10:05.160 --> 10:07.920
And you know, some people aren't building their systems for that.

10:07.920 --> 10:13.560
I think there is a spot in that Mate XFCE cinnamon market.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.560
I think Unity is a real contender.

10:15.560 --> 10:22.360
And I think the question was when they launched this fork forever ago now, could they actually

10:22.360 --> 10:23.360
do it?

10:23.360 --> 10:24.360
Could they actually maintain it?

10:24.360 --> 10:29.000
I mean, sure, one release, you know, getting one more version of Unity out, sure, fine.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.160
But could they actually do it?

10:30.160 --> 10:32.440
And it seems like they can.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.680
And the little trick that they've done is they've bundled a bunch of apps that, you

10:35.680 --> 10:39.200
know, weren't originally in the Ubuntu mix for this, but sure seem to work great for

10:39.200 --> 10:40.200
it.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.320
Which hopefully is a nice sort of, you know, to set the scope appropriately here, right?

10:43.320 --> 10:46.620
Keeping Unity going, you can provide a whole sort of experience, but you don't need to

10:46.620 --> 10:50.840
reinvent the whole world.

10:50.840 --> 10:53.000
Linode.com slash unplugged.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.400
That's where you go to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.440
It's just a great way to support the show.

10:58.440 --> 11:03.920
And it gets you down the path of trying out Linode's feature set on their dime, not yours,

11:03.920 --> 11:05.960
which is just always a better way to go.

11:05.960 --> 11:09.240
You know, Linode is really the Linux geeks cloud.

11:09.240 --> 11:14.000
We've deployed our new website, jupyterbroadcasting.com now runs from Linode.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.680
After a long time on a previous provider, we just had to rebuild and we wanted to rebuild

11:18.680 --> 11:20.280
it in a modern way.

11:20.280 --> 11:24.680
And one of the things I appreciate at a whole new level now is just how well Linode integrates

11:24.680 --> 11:27.680
with infrastructure management tools that we already have in place.

11:27.680 --> 11:33.120
You know, like Ansible and Kubernetes and Terraform, which by the way, side tangent,

11:33.120 --> 11:37.720
they have incredible Kubernetes documentation that they have just been working with just

11:37.720 --> 11:44.440
like tons of different really well known, really educated, really smart Kubernetes content

11:44.440 --> 11:45.440
providers.

11:45.440 --> 11:48.640
And they're putting some of that information out now on Linode's platform and on different

11:48.640 --> 11:49.640
YouTube channels.

11:49.640 --> 11:53.600
Anyways, it's worth going to their documentation website if you're trying to learn Kubernetes

11:53.600 --> 11:56.320
because they've just put together some of the best resources out there.

11:56.320 --> 11:58.760
They really have done a great job at that.

11:58.760 --> 12:02.520
But anyways, I just I really can appreciate it now because here's the crazy thing.

12:02.520 --> 12:05.360
And I was joking about this in a recent office hours, you guys.

12:05.360 --> 12:10.480
I make a website change and deploy it using Git.

12:10.480 --> 12:17.620
It goes to a GitHub repo and then like two minutes later, our website's updated.

12:17.620 --> 12:22.760
And Linode is just part of that entire pipeline and it's so perfectly part of that pipeline

12:22.760 --> 12:27.280
and then you combine it with their incredible performance.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.560
It's awesome.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.320
It's working so well for us.

12:30.320 --> 12:34.760
And of course, they've been rolling out screaming fast MVME PCIe storage.

12:34.760 --> 12:39.000
They have reliable, flexible S3 compatible object storage.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.200
And this dashboard is so easy to use that everyone on our team, you know, brand new

12:42.200 --> 12:44.720
to server stuff, people have been doing it forever.

12:44.720 --> 12:45.720
We can all work together.

12:45.720 --> 12:46.720
And they have that API.

12:46.720 --> 12:51.140
They snap in with Ansible and then they just kind of back it all up with the best customer

12:51.140 --> 12:54.080
support in the business, like, you know, no bigs, but it's actually like the biggest of

12:54.080 --> 12:55.360
the bigs.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.920
And they're architected in a way where all of their competitors are not.

12:58.920 --> 13:01.960
So they just cannot even compete on this front.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.280
Linode's been doing this for nearly 19 years.

13:04.280 --> 13:05.560
So they figured this stuff out.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.120
They got super fast rigs.

13:07.120 --> 13:12.480
They are their own ISP, 11 data centers around the world and a Linux culture that runs deep.

13:12.480 --> 13:14.720
So go try them out, support the show and get 100 bucks to do it.

13:14.720 --> 13:18.120
You go to linode.com slash unplugged.

13:18.120 --> 13:23.320
Go see why we chose to build our new website and we chose to run it on Linode, linode.com

13:23.320 --> 13:28.920
slash unplugged.

13:28.920 --> 13:31.120
We got some big news.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.380
We got some really big news.

13:33.380 --> 13:43.320
This week, our new website went live, built by our community, truly an awesome moment

13:43.320 --> 13:44.360
in value for value.

13:44.360 --> 13:50.200
Our community came together and just built us an awesome Hugo based website.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.160
I knew I wanted to move away from WordPress.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.160
Love you WordPress.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.160
But it was time.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.120
It was time.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.120
So great.

13:57.120 --> 14:00.040
So if you haven't seen the new Jupiter Broadcasting dot com, go check it out.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.840
And then we've got the details in office hours 11.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.760
We actually because you know how we roll.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.220
We flip the switch live.

14:07.220 --> 14:10.080
We published the website while we were doing the show.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.080
YOLO.

14:11.080 --> 14:12.680
We didn't break too many things.

14:12.680 --> 14:16.480
There was some interesting breakage, but we'll talk about that later in the show.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.280
But so happy to have that big thank you to our community.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.440
Go get all the details in office hours 11.

14:21.440 --> 14:25.940
You can watch the video version, too, at Jupiter Dot Tube for that.

14:25.940 --> 14:31.520
Now just weeks away to our West Coast crew meetups, a string of meetups on the West Coast.

14:31.520 --> 14:35.120
Go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting to find the one near you.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.120
Join us.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.120
Let us know.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.120
We got to get the venues updated.

14:38.120 --> 14:41.340
We've sent out the invites to the JPL tour.

14:41.340 --> 14:43.480
We had a couple of names, you know, get swapped.

14:43.480 --> 14:44.480
We had our backup list.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.860
It's been going real smooth.

14:45.860 --> 14:48.020
People are people are verifying that they can go.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.020
That's getting locked in.

14:49.020 --> 14:50.020
It's getting close.

14:50.020 --> 14:53.900
We'll have more details on that soon.

14:53.900 --> 14:57.080
The real excitement starting now, I'm starting to get very hyped about the road trip.

14:57.080 --> 15:00.320
Hey, don't forget to we've also got like a handy dandy little matrix room.

15:00.320 --> 15:04.320
If you want to chat, you want to do some planning, you want to find out what's going on leveling

15:04.320 --> 15:07.560
for that in the show notes as well.

15:07.560 --> 15:13.840
All right, now, I want to thank some of our top supporters for this week's episode.

15:13.840 --> 15:16.700
And our first one came in from Nilth as our top baller boost.

15:16.700 --> 15:24.240
And it is three hundred and seven thousand two hundred sats, which is oh, my goodness.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.240
Yeah.

15:25.240 --> 15:27.540
So I said, hi, all Nilth here.

15:27.540 --> 15:30.180
This is my first boost ever.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.440
Loving Fountain.

15:31.440 --> 15:32.440
You did it right.

15:32.440 --> 15:35.260
Live in Linux and I work in enterprise windows.

15:35.260 --> 15:36.260
So he lives.

15:36.260 --> 15:37.260
I think he means like day to day.

15:37.260 --> 15:41.220
He lives in Linux and he works in enterprise windows, which been there, man.

15:41.220 --> 15:45.140
He says, what are your thoughts on Dotnet on Linux and what sort of future do you see

15:45.140 --> 15:46.140
for it?

15:46.140 --> 15:50.260
Do you envision any form of scale in its adoption among the community and what sort of open

15:50.260 --> 15:53.860
source authentication protocol you could get access by paying sats, sort of like a toll

15:53.860 --> 15:55.940
booth, maybe a sat booth?

15:55.940 --> 15:56.980
We'll take both questions.

15:56.980 --> 15:57.980
So first question.

15:57.980 --> 16:01.540
Wes, you and I actually talked about this off air.

16:01.540 --> 16:05.920
I think Dotnet is going to continue to be a very successful platform on Linux, not so

16:05.920 --> 16:12.180
much in our bubble, but very much so in the enterprise bubble, the kind of area that Nilth

16:12.180 --> 16:13.180
is in.

16:13.180 --> 16:17.500
I think Dotnet is going to be huge there and continue to just have massive adoption, if

16:17.500 --> 16:24.780
not for just the massive momentum of Microsoft's platform in the small to medium business space.

16:24.780 --> 16:27.540
And then, you know, you just combine that with, I mean, who wants to keep running Windows

16:27.540 --> 16:28.540
servers these days?

16:28.540 --> 16:31.460
And if you, you know, if you are keeping up with things and you're moving things to using

16:31.460 --> 16:34.620
the Dotnet core world and you get off some of the stuff that was Windows only.

16:34.620 --> 16:35.620
Yeah, right.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.100
You can just containerize that stuff.

16:37.100 --> 16:39.500
They've made a lot of improvements for running containerized Dotnet apps.

16:39.500 --> 16:42.740
The Dotnet runtime keeps getting better and it just sort of, you know, you could fit it

16:42.740 --> 16:46.220
into a regular Linux server side deploy platform.

16:46.220 --> 16:50.500
That's the thing, you know, like it's not like we're going to do a show on it or something,

16:50.500 --> 16:53.060
but Dotnet seems like it's actually been doing really well.

16:53.060 --> 16:58.480
We cover its development in Coderadio and you got to you got to acknowledge when they're

16:58.480 --> 16:59.480
making good strides.

16:59.480 --> 17:04.460
They seem to be making genuinely competitive strides with Dotnet.

17:04.460 --> 17:06.020
It's always nice to have Linux support.

17:06.020 --> 17:09.260
And then that second part, what about like some sort of open source authentication protocol

17:09.260 --> 17:16.540
that you get access by paying SATs and think of like maybe a Linux ISO download or a special

17:16.540 --> 17:18.300
edition of a podcast.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.300
Maybe you get access.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.100
There are projects in the works right now for that.

17:21.100 --> 17:22.940
I'm drawing a blank on the name.

17:22.940 --> 17:27.140
So if you do know, boost in or email in, but there's a couple of projects out there that

17:27.140 --> 17:28.900
are working on it.

17:28.900 --> 17:32.700
I want to take a moment, though, and just thank you for the significant support here.

17:32.700 --> 17:38.540
I don't talk about this a lot, especially in relation to just how extremely passionate

17:38.540 --> 17:39.540
I am about this topic.

17:39.540 --> 17:40.540
All right.

17:40.540 --> 17:43.600
I'm bringing the receipts to office hours 12 to back up what I'm about to say.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.100
But I don't want to make this any longer than it has to be because I know not all of you

17:46.100 --> 17:49.540
care about the future of podcasting.

17:49.540 --> 17:57.980
But there is a rapid freight train approaching of dynamic ad insertion that they've realized

17:57.980 --> 18:03.380
the way to make money now, the dynamic ad insertion companies, is not to go after large

18:03.380 --> 18:06.340
podcasts, but to go after the smaller podcasts.

18:06.340 --> 18:08.180
Get a ton of the tiny guys.

18:08.180 --> 18:13.640
Get a ton of them and just blast them with the same dynamic ads over and over again.

18:13.640 --> 18:17.700
And they are making offers and letters to podcasters like crazy.

18:17.700 --> 18:20.700
And something that you might not understand if you're not a content creator, but it becomes

18:20.700 --> 18:24.080
immediately obvious if you ever want to try to do this as a business.

18:24.080 --> 18:28.820
If you create a YouTube channel, there is an inherent path to monetization built into

18:28.820 --> 18:29.820
the platform.

18:29.820 --> 18:31.660
You just have to get to a certain number of views.

18:31.660 --> 18:34.000
To do that, you have to placate the algorithm.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
We all know what that leads to.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.200
I don't need to explain the downsides to that.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.340
But in order to get views, you placate the algorithm.

18:39.340 --> 18:42.400
When you placate the algorithm, you get featured.

18:42.400 --> 18:43.700
People watch you.

18:43.700 --> 18:44.700
You get monetized.

18:44.700 --> 18:45.700
That's how it works.

18:45.700 --> 18:48.020
Some of that ad money goes your way.

18:48.020 --> 18:49.220
Right.

18:49.220 --> 18:51.300
Nothing like that exists in podcasting.

18:51.300 --> 18:54.300
There's no path to monetization in podcasting.

18:54.300 --> 18:58.540
You start out, you just throw some MP3s and an RSS feed out there, and it doesn't get

18:58.540 --> 18:59.540
you money.

18:59.540 --> 19:00.740
It's all decentralized.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.200
It's an open market.

19:02.200 --> 19:06.660
There's no platform that's going to have an algorithm.

19:06.660 --> 19:07.660
People are building that.

19:07.660 --> 19:10.380
But there hasn't been something like that traditionally.

19:10.380 --> 19:13.940
And so what you've had is a bunch of bespoke business models.

19:13.940 --> 19:16.940
Individual content creators coming up with their own models.

19:16.940 --> 19:18.620
But it is an intense amount of work.

19:18.620 --> 19:22.820
Plus you have to be able to run a business and manage your taxes and just do general

19:22.820 --> 19:26.040
things that sometimes people find challenging.

19:26.040 --> 19:31.860
And you have to do it and not get in trouble by the IRS and all of that, too.

19:31.860 --> 19:37.540
It leads to all different types of approaches, which is probably a good thing in a marketplace.

19:37.540 --> 19:42.460
But it also leads to whatever is going to be just the easiest route.

19:42.460 --> 19:46.860
And because it's hard, because it's bespoke, and because you have to build it yourself,

19:46.860 --> 19:51.100
it's so much easier if somebody just says, I'll give you $1,000 a month.

19:51.100 --> 19:56.340
You just run our dynamic ads, and you're going to get $1,000 plus a performance bonus.

19:56.340 --> 19:59.100
If you hit this level, you're going to get this bonus.

19:59.100 --> 20:00.100
Right.

20:00.100 --> 20:02.500
And suddenly you're thinking, all right, now I've got some revenue coming in.

20:02.500 --> 20:05.860
I don't have to worry about finding my next set of advertisers or whatever else I need

20:05.860 --> 20:07.300
to do to bring in that money.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.220
And I'm focusing on the content over here.

20:09.220 --> 20:10.220
Right.

20:10.220 --> 20:16.340
But the reality is you start tweaking the content to whatever operator, whatever platform

20:16.340 --> 20:18.340
is divvying out those ads.

20:18.340 --> 20:23.260
That becomes who you tweak the content for because you have to maximize that return.

20:23.260 --> 20:26.100
That becomes your incentive is maximizing that.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.900
And it's a perverse incentive.

20:27.900 --> 20:31.160
And you see it, I think the best example is on YouTube.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.180
You see what it has done to YouTube.

20:33.180 --> 20:37.660
And now it's beginning to happen with podcasts because of Spotify, because of groups like

20:37.660 --> 20:38.660
Libsyn.

20:38.660 --> 20:39.660
I'm calling Libsyn out.

20:39.660 --> 20:41.660
They're bad for the podcast industry.

20:41.660 --> 20:46.020
And because of this dynamic insertion technology that several different providers are trying

20:46.020 --> 20:52.140
to go after, it creates a perverse set of incentives for content creators.

20:52.140 --> 20:58.660
Boosts are the only solution that is truly decentralized, that is truly global, that

20:58.660 --> 21:00.300
there is no middleman.

21:00.300 --> 21:04.260
I run my node up in my office.

21:04.260 --> 21:05.500
I run that.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.380
I manage that.

21:07.380 --> 21:09.100
There's no middleman.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.120
And there's no algorithm.

21:11.120 --> 21:17.220
My only incentive is to please the audience so they're encouraged to boost.

21:17.220 --> 21:21.620
I think we get lost in like the sats and the crypto aspect of it.

21:21.620 --> 21:29.180
And we don't zoom out and realize that what we have is a massive shift in an industry.

21:29.180 --> 21:34.100
And what we are trying to champion here is a better way to do things where there can

21:34.100 --> 21:39.040
be a built in way to monetization and podcasting that is truly decentralized, that puts the

21:39.040 --> 21:42.660
audience first because you were incentivized to encourage the audience to boost by giving

21:42.660 --> 21:44.260
them the content they want.

21:44.260 --> 21:48.220
And it is the incentives are aligned with the expectations of the audience, and it is

21:48.220 --> 21:49.220
truly decentralized.

21:49.220 --> 21:53.220
Oh, and by the way, it's all built on free software.

21:53.220 --> 21:55.540
This is why the boosts are a big deal.

21:55.540 --> 22:02.900
And that's why when Nilf boosts in with 307,000 sats, he's helping to vote into a decentralized

22:02.900 --> 22:07.700
participant network that as more people come online becomes even more valuable.

22:07.700 --> 22:12.020
And now when Nilf's favorite free software project comes online to the Lightning Network,

22:12.020 --> 22:14.420
Nilf can send them a boost.

22:14.420 --> 22:15.420
Sorry if I'm saying the name wrong.

22:15.420 --> 22:16.420
Am I getting it right?

22:16.420 --> 22:17.420
No, you're doing great.

22:17.420 --> 22:18.420
All right.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.480
So thank you very much for the support.

22:19.480 --> 22:22.920
That's why we talk about the boosts on the show, because it is a bigger picture.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.720
There's a broader trend happening in the industry.

22:24.720 --> 22:28.380
And like I said, I will bring the receipts to the next office hours to prove it to you.

22:28.380 --> 22:32.740
I have the audio, I have the links, I have all of it to show you what's happening.

22:32.740 --> 22:36.540
Or you could just take my word for being in this industry for 15 years up to you.

22:36.540 --> 22:41.000
But that's why I thank you to our baller boost, to everybody who boosts in, to our members

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
as well.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.740
The membership programs play absolutely an essential role in that.

22:45.740 --> 22:46.740
So-

22:46.740 --> 22:48.140
We want to be here making content for you.

22:48.140 --> 22:54.660
With that, because I just have to get that out there because I think short-sighted individuals

22:54.660 --> 22:59.420
can look at just the sats aspect of it because it's ooh, it's crypto.

22:59.420 --> 23:04.140
Or they can think about like the jingles and that can be distracting.

23:04.140 --> 23:05.980
And that's the surface level stuff.

23:05.980 --> 23:10.340
Now what we're trying to do here is to create a monetization platform that incentivizes

23:10.340 --> 23:14.300
creators to produce good content for their audience.

23:14.300 --> 23:19.540
And anything else, dynamic ad insertion, Spotify centralization, Apple memberships, is bad

23:19.540 --> 23:20.540
for the listeners.

23:20.540 --> 23:22.060
It's bad for podcasting.

23:22.060 --> 23:27.060
It is the difference between free software and commercial software, decentralized and

23:27.060 --> 23:28.060
centralized.

23:28.060 --> 23:33.520
End of rant and we wrap it up with John A's 25,000 baller boost, our last baller boost

23:33.520 --> 23:34.520
of the episode.

23:34.520 --> 23:36.740
He says, you know what guys?

23:36.740 --> 23:41.860
Doing it the Nix way, it forces you to put everything into documentation.

23:41.860 --> 23:43.500
It is self-documenting.

23:43.500 --> 23:46.220
It's light years ahead of any other way of doing things.

23:46.220 --> 23:48.100
Who cares if you forget how it's set up?

23:48.100 --> 23:49.100
He's talking to me because I mentioned-

23:49.100 --> 23:52.220
Yeah, you were saying like, oh, I like this, but I'm worried that I'll forget how I'd set

23:52.220 --> 23:53.220
it up.

23:53.220 --> 23:54.220
Who cares if you forget how it's set up?

23:54.220 --> 23:55.220
It's self-documenting.

23:55.220 --> 23:56.900
I agree.

23:56.900 --> 23:58.700
I love the Nix love out there.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.380
There's some serious Nix love.

24:00.380 --> 24:04.380
I will say there's still room for comments and notes though because, you know, it's self

24:04.380 --> 24:07.100
documented the way it's going to work and it'll just run and set up, but if you need

24:07.100 --> 24:10.300
to make changes, you will probably need to remember a few things here or there.

24:10.300 --> 24:14.100
I like putting the comments in there with the date because then I look back and go,

24:14.100 --> 24:16.180
oh, huh, I figured that out back in June.

24:16.180 --> 24:17.180
Oh, that's interesting.

24:17.180 --> 24:18.180
Right.

24:18.180 --> 24:20.200
And you can leave yourself some little notes to be like, oh, here's like the Wiki page

24:20.200 --> 24:23.780
that I found some notes on this or the actual manual page and then just jump right back

24:23.780 --> 24:24.780
there.

24:24.780 --> 24:25.780
Yeah.

24:25.780 --> 24:31.260
I definitely am a big fan of just adding a little note to Future Chris, you know, just

24:31.260 --> 24:32.260
to remind Future Chris-

24:32.260 --> 24:34.060
Because that guy, he's got a lot going on.

24:34.060 --> 24:35.060
Yeah.

24:35.060 --> 24:36.060
Two RVs now?

24:36.060 --> 24:37.060
Wow.

24:37.060 --> 24:38.060
Really?

24:38.060 --> 24:39.060
Two RVs.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.060
All right.

24:40.060 --> 24:41.860
You got to have your work in RV and your sleep in RV.

24:41.860 --> 24:42.860
That's right.

24:42.860 --> 24:43.860
Right.

24:43.860 --> 24:45.980
Or just a whole studio RV that's dedicated for road trips.

24:45.980 --> 24:46.980
All right.

24:46.980 --> 24:50.220
If you'd like to send us in a boost and to get into our Baller Boost segment, please

24:50.220 --> 24:51.220
do so.

24:51.220 --> 24:55.180
You can get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com or go grab Breeze if you don't want to switch

24:55.180 --> 24:56.980
podcast apps.

24:56.980 --> 25:01.260
And if your boost is of a certain large amount, we don't specify, we allow you to sign the

25:01.260 --> 25:02.260
value.

25:02.260 --> 25:04.180
That's into the Baller Boost segment.

25:04.180 --> 25:05.180
All right.

25:05.180 --> 25:12.980
I want to talk about a future where we have a pretty decent market share for desktop Linux.

25:12.980 --> 25:15.260
Maybe it's, maybe it's via Chrome OS.

25:15.260 --> 25:19.820
I think for today's, unless you guys disagree, I think for today's conversation, let's say

25:19.820 --> 25:28.020
a distribution like Endless or Ubuntu proper just kind of reaches four, five, 8%, 10% of

25:28.020 --> 25:29.020
the market.

25:29.020 --> 25:32.020
Somewhere around probably where the max, I don't even know if the max that high, but

25:32.020 --> 25:37.100
somewhere in the max territory today, let's say, you know, in five to 10 years, Linux

25:37.100 --> 25:38.100
gets there.

25:38.100 --> 25:39.100
All right.

25:39.100 --> 25:40.100
So that's kind of the timeline.

25:40.100 --> 25:41.100
That's kind of the category.

25:41.100 --> 25:44.460
There's maybe a few more, a few more sort of shops have defaulted to offering it as

25:44.460 --> 25:48.500
an option alongside windows when you're buying PCs and it's relatively, you know, a little

25:48.500 --> 25:49.500
common.

25:49.500 --> 25:55.540
And if we go five to 10 years back in time, Apple had a very specific message to position

25:55.540 --> 25:57.940
their operating system over their competitors.

25:57.940 --> 26:01.540
Hello, I'm a Mac and I'm a PC.

26:01.540 --> 26:03.340
You okay?

26:03.340 --> 26:07.140
No, I'm not okay.

26:07.140 --> 26:09.580
I have that virus that's going around.

26:09.580 --> 26:12.540
Oh, you better, you better stay back.

26:12.540 --> 26:13.540
This one's a doozy.

26:13.540 --> 26:14.540
That's okay.

26:14.540 --> 26:15.540
I'll be fine.

26:15.540 --> 26:16.540
No, no.

26:16.540 --> 26:17.540
Do not be a hero.

26:17.540 --> 26:19.580
Last year there were 114,000 known viruses for PCs.

26:19.580 --> 26:21.060
PCs, not Macs.

26:21.060 --> 26:22.860
So just grab this thing.

26:22.860 --> 26:23.860
I think I got a crash.

26:23.860 --> 26:26.900
Hey, if you feel like that'll help.

26:26.900 --> 26:27.900
Good.

26:27.900 --> 26:34.180
There was a such a non-issue for Apple's platform that it was the basis of an ad campaign that

26:34.180 --> 26:37.020
actually was very successful for them.

26:37.020 --> 26:40.860
It really started life as the no viruses platform that used to be the pitch.

26:40.860 --> 26:44.860
You know, if you're sick of your viruses on your windows XP and your windows seven, go

26:44.860 --> 26:45.860
get a Mac.

26:45.860 --> 26:46.860
It's got no viruses.

26:46.860 --> 26:49.700
You won't get three levels of browser bars suddenly added in there.

26:49.700 --> 26:53.460
And they got almost a decade with that reputation, almost.

26:53.460 --> 26:57.980
And so for a while, the Mac fans just kind of started telling themselves, well, it's

26:57.980 --> 26:59.780
because Mac OS is built better.

26:59.780 --> 27:01.840
We have a user permission to system.

27:01.840 --> 27:04.860
You have to have pseudo privileges to alter the system.

27:04.860 --> 27:06.500
Mac OS is just built better than windows.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.700
I mean, we all know how annoying it is to run a random download you get off the internet

27:09.700 --> 27:11.140
on Mac OS these days.

27:11.140 --> 27:12.140
Yeah.

27:12.140 --> 27:13.140
Yeah.

27:13.140 --> 27:14.140
Well, that's part of it.

27:14.140 --> 27:16.760
They've had to build in a lot of these security features over the year.

27:16.760 --> 27:22.420
And now it seems they're almost at a scrambling pace, adding features into the latest version

27:22.420 --> 27:23.420
of Mac OS.

27:23.420 --> 27:24.420
It's currently under development.

27:24.420 --> 27:29.180
We'll have a link in the show notes Mac OS malware development has surged by over a thousand

27:29.180 --> 27:34.500
percent in the last couple of years, according to Atlas VPN.

27:34.500 --> 27:42.140
And Apple is aggressively building in new real time, always running malware scanners.

27:42.140 --> 27:44.820
Now they're taking it to a whole new level.

27:44.820 --> 27:48.420
If you are not using your Mac, it's like windows defender.

27:48.420 --> 27:52.540
They're going to now be scanning for all different kinds of malware in the background actively

27:52.540 --> 27:54.280
when your system is idle.

27:54.280 --> 27:55.740
They're building in their own virus scanner.

27:55.740 --> 28:00.100
They're doing a new set of virus definition updates they can push to it silently in the

28:00.100 --> 28:01.300
background.

28:01.300 --> 28:02.840
This is all happening.

28:02.840 --> 28:06.340
It's been kind of building for the last few Mac OS releases, but they're really going

28:06.340 --> 28:11.340
aggressive because the issue, you know, a thousand percent growth is starting to actually

28:11.340 --> 28:14.860
become a problem for their end users because it turns out there's a lot of damage you can

28:14.860 --> 28:17.660
do just as the regular user and you can get a lot of information.

28:17.660 --> 28:18.660
Right.

28:18.660 --> 28:22.500
And, you know, it turns out your regular user owns most of your files.

28:22.500 --> 28:27.980
And so it seems as the Mac has grown in popularity, so has Mac malware.

28:27.980 --> 28:32.540
And Apple has been kind of slow to come around to it, but they're pretty aggressive now.

28:32.540 --> 28:37.660
And so I wonder for the sake of discussion, is it possible we could see Linux go down

28:37.660 --> 28:40.960
a similar route?

28:40.960 --> 28:46.400
Could we see this become an issue where today, you know, they're not not that big of a deal.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.580
Viruses aren't really a problem.

28:47.580 --> 28:48.580
They're not really doing much.

28:48.580 --> 28:50.860
Yeah, there's a few, but it's not a big deal.

28:50.860 --> 28:57.340
Well, who says developers wouldn't start targeting Linux users if there were a bunch of bunch

28:57.340 --> 28:58.340
of them out there?

28:58.340 --> 29:01.940
I mean, even just there's an article over in ZDNet on the first just a couple of days

29:01.940 --> 29:06.780
ago, Linux devices increasingly under attack from hackers or on security researchers pointing

29:06.780 --> 29:10.140
to, you know, just more and more, even if it's not the primary platform, more and more

29:10.140 --> 29:14.980
popular things like lockbit or other cryptocurrency mining things or just malware in general.

29:14.980 --> 29:18.460
They're at least offering a Linux version now.

29:18.460 --> 29:22.740
So it seems plausible that that could just get worse, especially because, I mean, Linux

29:22.740 --> 29:24.340
isn't going anywhere on the server, right?

29:24.340 --> 29:26.840
So there's there's reasons to target it there.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.420
And it's it's the same Linux.

29:28.420 --> 29:29.420
And Clam AV doesn't count.

29:29.420 --> 29:31.980
I mean, it is a great tool, but it just this isn't what we're talking about.

29:31.980 --> 29:36.680
We're talking about Mac OS is building in Windows Defender type technology that scans

29:36.680 --> 29:41.540
the system every 15 to 35 seconds.

29:41.540 --> 29:43.180
Every hour or two it does that scan.

29:43.180 --> 29:47.140
The face you're making right now suggests to me that you're not excited about this running

29:47.140 --> 29:48.140
on your machine.

29:48.140 --> 29:49.140
Would you want this?

29:49.140 --> 29:52.580
Like, do you ever want to run antivirus on your machines ever?

29:52.580 --> 29:56.740
I mean, not to be like an elitist, but I don't want to run antivirus.

29:56.740 --> 30:00.620
Part of me kind of thinks it's it's not that I'm opposed to that.

30:00.620 --> 30:04.000
Like the idea, you know, it's already common in a lot of sort of production environments

30:04.000 --> 30:05.180
to have endpoint detection.

30:05.180 --> 30:09.220
They're trying to scan for anomalies and changes, but all that stuff sucks.

30:09.220 --> 30:12.060
Well, the desktop ones do not necessarily some of the server side.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.060
Yeah.

30:13.060 --> 30:18.180
So I think that's where I think it's maybe useful to like, are we objecting to the idea

30:18.180 --> 30:19.380
or the implementation?

30:19.380 --> 30:22.820
Because like the idea that my system could be self-monitoring and give me data is kind

30:22.820 --> 30:26.540
of like, you know, when we talk about other things like having data on cars where I want

30:26.540 --> 30:29.220
that info, I'd like to be alerted to changes in my system.

30:29.220 --> 30:32.660
But I also want to be able to configure how that runs, how often and how many resources

30:32.660 --> 30:33.660
it'll use.

30:33.660 --> 30:35.780
Here's where it crosses the line for me.

30:35.780 --> 30:36.940
It's turned on.

30:36.940 --> 30:38.100
It's like a deep level thing.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.980
There's not really any user control.

30:39.980 --> 30:42.500
And when it runs, it turns on telemetry.

30:42.500 --> 30:44.700
So it's reporting back to Apple all the time, too.

30:44.700 --> 30:46.540
Oh, well, that's a problem.

30:46.540 --> 30:47.540
Yeah.

30:47.540 --> 30:48.980
You have something that's built in.

30:48.980 --> 30:51.900
You have something that's reporting telemetry back to Apple.

30:51.900 --> 30:56.180
I just feel like if we got to this point in Linux and we needed this kind of tooling,

30:56.180 --> 30:57.820
I got to hope we do it better.

30:57.820 --> 30:58.820
Right?

30:58.820 --> 31:02.780
Like you'd be able to turn it off, you know, or you'd be able to not have it at all in

31:02.780 --> 31:03.780
theory.

31:03.780 --> 31:07.060
Now, the flip side, I wonder, is there some, you know, is there also an incentive to try

31:07.060 --> 31:11.100
to get some of that tooling in place just in the if we want to see more Linux adoption,

31:11.100 --> 31:14.180
it seems like more and more users will begin to expect it.

31:14.180 --> 31:18.620
And certainly, you know, enterprises and serious shops that are using it as workstations already

31:18.620 --> 31:19.620
do.

31:19.620 --> 31:23.660
Yeah, I've seen distros that sell to enterprises that, you know, advertisers that come in with

31:23.660 --> 31:24.660
built in antivirus.

31:24.660 --> 31:26.540
And that's not really what I'm picturing.

31:26.540 --> 31:32.400
I'm picturing something like system D scan, you know, something that's built in like Apple's

31:32.400 --> 31:34.580
doing built into the lower levels of Linux.

31:34.580 --> 31:37.420
But I have to think we would do it differently.

31:37.420 --> 31:42.060
And I'm not sure if it's 100% better, because this seems like an area where fragmentation

31:42.060 --> 31:46.660
would provide less effectiveness, but also gives us more choice.

31:46.660 --> 31:49.940
So I could choose a distro that just doesn't include this, or you could easily turn it

31:49.940 --> 31:50.940
off.

31:50.940 --> 31:54.980
But it wouldn't be as effective because it's not being centrally managed and controlled

31:54.980 --> 31:59.420
and not centrally pushing out to all machines at the same time on the same OS and, you know,

31:59.420 --> 32:01.460
which could mitigate an active problem.

32:01.460 --> 32:02.460
Right.

32:02.460 --> 32:06.500
If we if we kind of keep that mentality we have now of whatever, at least somewhat assembling

32:06.500 --> 32:08.100
and tweaking and changing things.

32:08.100 --> 32:11.180
But maybe that's harder to in a world where you're you are using something like endless

32:11.180 --> 32:15.860
or silver blue, and that stuff's kind of just pre baked in for you into the image and starts

32:15.860 --> 32:16.860
up.

32:16.860 --> 32:19.780
Brent, what do you think is somebody who likes to know exactly what his machine is up to?

32:19.780 --> 32:24.640
Does this maybe convert a few Mac OS power users to Linux?

32:24.640 --> 32:29.380
This is a hacker news comment I saw quote, Mac OS really seems to try to frustrate power

32:29.380 --> 32:31.940
users with these non optional security features.

32:31.940 --> 32:36.820
I even had to make a separate note document with the commands and references to disable

32:36.820 --> 32:38.340
various security features.

32:38.340 --> 32:43.580
I don't understand why they choose to frustrate this audience by making it so difficult.

32:43.580 --> 32:49.480
And then there was a cascade of child comment threads just talking about different ways

32:49.480 --> 32:55.200
they disable like security checks and like all these like hodgepodge solutions to turn

32:55.200 --> 32:56.740
this crap off.

32:56.740 --> 33:00.380
And at certain points, like, don't you just get frustrated fighting your your work tool?

33:00.380 --> 33:02.060
Well, yeah, absolutely.

33:02.060 --> 33:08.220
I mean, that's one of okay, and I'm not necessarily gonna put myself in the power user box or

33:08.220 --> 33:12.060
but that's one of the reasons I left the Mac 10 years ago was exactly that is like all

33:12.060 --> 33:16.980
this stuff's on and you had to change a bunch of stuff to make it your own, or at least

33:16.980 --> 33:18.480
to have it run the way you wanted.

33:18.480 --> 33:21.580
And that became more and more frustrating.

33:21.580 --> 33:26.120
And I would imagine now this could easily tip some people over the edge.

33:26.120 --> 33:31.420
But the question I have then is, and maybe it's the whole crux of the issue is like,

33:31.420 --> 33:33.220
those are implemented to try to help the user.

33:33.220 --> 33:39.140
And so what is the delta there between it being helpful and it being harmful to say

33:39.140 --> 33:40.860
productivity or something like that.

33:40.860 --> 33:45.900
So I, I feel like there's a better balance there or maybe it's better communication or

33:45.900 --> 33:48.820
like you said, better options for tweaking it.

33:48.820 --> 33:53.100
Because you know, if a bunch of people are just by default disabling the securities that

33:53.100 --> 33:58.020
are in place to try to keep them, you know, a little bit safer than what happens next,

33:58.020 --> 33:59.220
you know, is that really problematic?

33:59.220 --> 34:05.540
Yeah, I wonder if Apple would argue because it's built into the OS, it's less resource

34:05.540 --> 34:09.340
intensive because they can monitor what the system is doing more carefully and then run

34:09.340 --> 34:10.340
it.

34:10.340 --> 34:11.340
I don't know.

34:11.340 --> 34:14.900
I don't know if I buy that, because anything that's using more disk IO and using more

34:14.900 --> 34:17.700
memory and more processor, I'm not really a fan of.

34:17.700 --> 34:18.700
I don't really care.

34:18.700 --> 34:22.220
I don't care how who built it or how you know, low end it is.

34:22.220 --> 34:23.460
I just don't like it.

34:23.460 --> 34:28.860
I think too, you have to figure maybe the lesson that us Linux users could take away

34:28.860 --> 34:32.420
from this is let's not be snarky now, right?

34:32.420 --> 34:37.660
So that way some jackass isn't playing YouTube clips of us 10 years later laughing about

34:37.660 --> 34:39.460
how there's no viruses for Linux.

34:39.460 --> 34:43.940
I think we have to acknowledge that if the user base was large enough, people would start

34:43.940 --> 34:46.980
developing malware for the desktop.

34:46.980 --> 34:51.180
I like to think, though, that even when that starts to happen, it's not really ever going

34:51.180 --> 34:54.260
to get as bad as it did in Windows heyday, you know?

34:54.260 --> 34:58.820
I know not to channel some of that early, you know, a Mac overconfidence that they seem

34:58.820 --> 35:02.860
to have, but I just can't imagine it could be that bad.

35:02.860 --> 35:04.860
I think we'll have definitely user information loss.

35:04.860 --> 35:10.340
You're going to have stuff that can get encrypted, that kind of stuff, but it doesn't seem like

35:10.340 --> 35:15.900
it's going to ever be the scale it was back then just because the penetration of mobile

35:15.900 --> 35:20.700
and all these other platforms that are so popular, there isn't that one ginormous target

35:20.700 --> 35:21.700
like there was with Windows.

35:21.700 --> 35:26.740
And I mean, just as a whole industry, we've matured a lot in our approaches to security

35:26.740 --> 35:27.740
and sure, right?

35:27.740 --> 35:29.540
The Linux desktop in particular still has a long way to go.

35:29.540 --> 35:32.860
We're only now trying to get to things like containerized apps and immutability and, you

35:32.860 --> 35:36.740
know, sort of eventually maybe switching to Wayland and all of these things.

35:36.740 --> 35:40.820
But we are at least thinking of them and the, you know, some of the browsers and OS is way

35:40.820 --> 35:41.820
back in the day.

35:41.820 --> 35:44.360
They just that that was not the world of computing they were developed in.

35:44.360 --> 35:45.860
You just touched on something there.

35:45.860 --> 35:50.860
Like if we shipped, say, Linux today, where most people are on X11 and most people are

35:50.860 --> 35:52.860
using local packages.

35:52.860 --> 35:57.100
I just download devs I find on random forums and install them personally.

35:57.100 --> 35:59.600
That Linux would be in a worse position, right?

35:59.600 --> 36:02.780
That Linux is extremely vulnerable, especially X11 desktops.

36:02.780 --> 36:05.860
I mean, malware authors could just have a heyday with that.

36:05.860 --> 36:08.380
But I'm picturing Linux of the future is Wayland.

36:08.380 --> 36:10.540
Most applications are probably flat packed.

36:10.540 --> 36:15.340
So even if something gets on your system, you know, that's that application is self-contained

36:15.340 --> 36:18.740
and that's going to provide a lot of security because only you can only speak to that application

36:18.740 --> 36:21.480
in theory through the appropriate portals.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.540
So that that adds a layer of security.

36:23.540 --> 36:26.180
Then you look at these immutable desktops that we've been looking at.

36:26.180 --> 36:28.540
That adds a layer of security where you could just revert back.

36:28.540 --> 36:30.880
You start to bring all those technologies forward.

36:30.880 --> 36:33.860
And I think Linux would be in a lot better position by the time it has that kind of user

36:33.860 --> 36:34.860
share.

36:34.860 --> 36:35.860
I still think it's an issue.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.780
I still think we shouldn't be, you know, cocky about it.

36:38.780 --> 36:40.020
But I think it's not worth panicking.

36:40.020 --> 36:41.020
It's not.

36:41.020 --> 36:44.900
I do hope, too, that maybe at the same time, some of those methodologies enable us to keep

36:44.900 --> 36:45.900
really on top.

36:45.900 --> 36:49.780
Because often you see with these issues, right, they often stem from vulnerabilities that

36:49.780 --> 36:52.540
may not yet be patched on machines.

36:52.540 --> 36:56.220
And so if we can build rock solid desktops that can just easily roll forward and keep

36:56.220 --> 36:58.620
up with security updates, I think that'll help our position.

36:58.620 --> 37:02.500
Brandly, you did a little digging around just to kind of see like what major vendors are

37:02.500 --> 37:05.180
recommending today in 2022.

37:05.180 --> 37:06.180
What'd you find?

37:06.180 --> 37:11.180
Well, I had a look to see like, okay, well, it's been I think it was like five years ago,

37:11.180 --> 37:16.580
I really dug into this and thought, okay, well, I know it's everyone says I don't need

37:16.580 --> 37:21.460
a virus program on Linux, but I'm gonna really have a look.

37:21.460 --> 37:24.080
And the answer was, no, no, don't worry about it.

37:24.080 --> 37:26.860
And almost every suggestion has like Clam AV in it.

37:26.860 --> 37:30.580
And it's not really a solution, as you mentioned, good for it.

37:30.580 --> 37:32.460
It's basically designed for other purposes.

37:32.460 --> 37:41.020
But I did find Red Hat had an article that was updated pretty recently, March 2022.

37:41.020 --> 37:44.260
So I think for an article like that, that's pretty darn recent.

37:44.260 --> 37:50.820
And the question was, is any virus protection software needed for Red Hat Enterprise Linux?

37:50.820 --> 37:55.040
And the post goes into a little bit of detail, but basically says, well, we've got a bunch

37:55.040 --> 37:56.040
of things built in.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.920
And we would say, nah, you don't really need it.

37:58.920 --> 38:01.180
But if you really want to, there's this Clam thing.

38:01.180 --> 38:07.460
And that's just a, you know, a one liner at the end of the article, but to have them describe,

38:07.460 --> 38:12.540
you know, to all of their vendors and everyone running their software that they don't really

38:12.540 --> 38:14.900
need it was interesting to me.

38:14.900 --> 38:20.980
And I think maybe not the whole story, but definitely a point to pay attention to.

38:20.980 --> 38:25.080
Yeah, I think we should probably do an episode on some comprehensive security.

38:25.080 --> 38:29.380
And I'd love tips, boosted and emailed in from the audience or in the matrix room as

38:29.380 --> 38:31.900
we kind of prepare for that.

38:31.900 --> 38:37.460
Because right now, today, the real threat model is going to be things like your SSH hanging

38:37.460 --> 38:41.580
open like a fool or you got some box directly on the Internet and you have software that's

38:41.580 --> 38:42.920
out of date.

38:42.920 --> 38:47.180
These are going to be more of your common attack threat vectors in Linux, in my opinion,

38:47.180 --> 38:54.100
today in 2022, because Linux is predominantly used in the server space and so predominantly

38:54.100 --> 38:55.100
the malware.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.420
Guess what?

38:56.420 --> 38:59.620
It targets servers because that's where the user base is.

38:59.620 --> 39:03.620
And so it's typical things you would do to keep a server safe online is what will generally

39:03.620 --> 39:05.900
keep your Linux box safe, even if it's your desktop.

39:05.900 --> 39:07.920
I mean, that's just the reality of it.

39:07.920 --> 39:10.140
And so I could totally see us doing an episode on that.

39:10.140 --> 39:14.060
The reason why we've kind of shied away from talking specifically about how to secure your

39:14.060 --> 39:17.420
Linux box is because it's going to vary depending on distro.

39:17.420 --> 39:21.240
But I think there are some concepts and some ideas we could cover if we could make it interesting.

39:21.240 --> 39:24.540
So I'd love to see what people suggest, because that's really what you got to worry about

39:24.540 --> 39:25.540
today.

39:25.540 --> 39:29.660
We're going to build some malware maybe one day, but we'll build the tooling when that

39:29.660 --> 39:30.660
time comes.

39:30.660 --> 39:31.660
Right?

39:31.660 --> 39:32.660
Oh, you're going to build that tooling?

39:32.660 --> 39:33.660
Yeah.

39:33.660 --> 39:34.660
No, I'm a developer.

39:34.660 --> 39:35.660
You're not.

39:35.660 --> 39:36.660
You're a developer.

39:36.660 --> 39:37.660
Yeah.

39:37.660 --> 39:38.660
I'll just do a pull request and then I'll merge it.

39:38.660 --> 39:39.660
I'd like a Flutter UI.

39:39.660 --> 39:40.660
Right.

39:40.660 --> 39:42.660
I guess all I have to do is make the pull request.

39:42.660 --> 39:45.340
Sometimes I just think I don't really know.

39:45.340 --> 39:47.800
I just like put something in there and then somebody else actually puts the real code

39:47.800 --> 39:48.800
in there.

39:48.800 --> 39:49.800
I don't even do that.

39:49.800 --> 39:50.800
I'm a really good developer.

39:50.800 --> 39:57.700
If you're in the community and GitHub co-pilot, you'll be set.

39:57.700 --> 39:59.300
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

39:59.300 --> 40:04.740
Go get started with a free trial for a team or an individual at bitwarden.com slash Linux.

40:04.740 --> 40:08.620
You know, Bitwarden is the easiest way for yourself or a business to share and sync sensitive

40:08.620 --> 40:09.620
data.

40:09.620 --> 40:12.540
It's what we use for our password management and it's open source.

40:12.540 --> 40:14.820
It's trusted by millions of individuals.

40:14.820 --> 40:18.860
You know, one of the things that I think I'm going to use the heck out of with Bitwarden

40:18.860 --> 40:20.740
is their offline support.

40:20.740 --> 40:23.700
If there's ever a chance you're going to need to access your vault while offline, Bitwarden

40:23.700 --> 40:25.180
has you covered here.

40:25.180 --> 40:29.580
You can read how to configure your application on their support site and on their blog post

40:29.580 --> 40:30.580
too.

40:30.580 --> 40:31.580
That's how I was reminded of it.

40:31.580 --> 40:35.580
And I'm pretty grateful because there will be times on our road trip where I won't have

40:35.580 --> 40:36.580
cell service.

40:36.580 --> 40:38.340
So I'm going to take advantage of that.

40:38.340 --> 40:42.300
And you know, it really seems like Bitwarden has been firing on all cylinders this last

40:42.300 --> 40:43.300
year.

40:43.300 --> 40:44.300
Have you noticed that?

40:44.300 --> 40:47.980
They have been cranking out features that I didn't even realize I needed in my password

40:47.980 --> 40:50.380
manager and now they've set the bar.

40:50.380 --> 40:55.140
I love how they're integrating in with email relay services to allow you to use my term

40:55.140 --> 40:56.140
relay.

40:56.140 --> 40:57.140
But you know what I'm talking about.

40:57.140 --> 41:00.100
These email front services that allow you to use an anonymous email address.

41:00.100 --> 41:04.140
So that way the service or the app doesn't have your actual email address.

41:04.140 --> 41:06.860
That's always been such a pain in the neck to actually go do.

41:06.860 --> 41:09.820
I mean, it's doable, but it's going to take you like another couple extra minutes and

41:09.820 --> 41:11.380
you just want to get this thing signed up.

41:11.380 --> 41:15.900
So they've integrated that capability now into Bitwarden.

41:15.900 --> 41:21.020
They also have automatic username generation along with the password generation.

41:21.020 --> 41:25.620
So you could use a unique username, a unique password and a unique email address for every

41:25.620 --> 41:27.420
site and service and app you use.

41:27.420 --> 41:29.300
And they all need logins now.

41:29.300 --> 41:30.740
All of them.

41:30.740 --> 41:32.140
Everything needs logins now.

41:32.140 --> 41:37.800
And so it's so tempting to use the same password across all of them just to make life simpler.

41:37.800 --> 41:40.660
But that's a fatal mistake.

41:40.660 --> 41:42.340
We have all seen it happen.

41:42.340 --> 41:48.620
I mean, it just happens almost on a weekly basis where an account somewhere at some service,

41:48.620 --> 41:50.820
maybe you signed up four years ago, maybe you signed up for recently.

41:50.820 --> 41:52.300
That just happened to me, actually.

41:52.300 --> 41:56.420
I recently signed up for a service and then a couple of months later their username password

41:56.420 --> 41:57.920
database got leaked.

41:57.920 --> 42:01.640
And I felt a lot better knowing that I had generated a unique password.

42:01.640 --> 42:05.780
Now I generate unique usernames as well, which makes me feel even better.

42:05.780 --> 42:07.220
So go try out Bitwarden.

42:07.220 --> 42:08.220
Go see why I love it.

42:08.220 --> 42:13.780
Go see just really why millions of the community out there trust it and go see how it can improve

42:13.780 --> 42:14.780
your game.

42:14.780 --> 42:16.380
And maybe you already know all this.

42:16.380 --> 42:17.380
You probably do.

42:17.380 --> 42:24.680
But maybe somebody you know, maybe your workplace, maybe a friend, maybe a family member, go

42:24.680 --> 42:26.340
take care of them.

42:26.340 --> 42:27.700
You know they need this too.

42:27.700 --> 42:30.100
Send them to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

42:30.100 --> 42:33.660
That's where you go to support the show and try out Bitwarden for yourself for free, for

42:33.660 --> 42:37.380
a team or for an individual.

42:37.380 --> 42:43.340
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

42:43.340 --> 42:49.700
Well if you're one of our beloved Matrix community members out there, you may have noticed something

42:49.700 --> 42:55.380
funny going on this week.

42:55.380 --> 42:59.220
Yeah we broke Federation, sorry about that.

42:59.220 --> 43:00.780
That was a fun one.

43:00.780 --> 43:03.900
Running Matrix is a lot of fun because you learn a lot.

43:03.900 --> 43:06.780
And so if you come out with that attitude, you're going to do great.

43:06.780 --> 43:09.980
Because it is a complex, it's got a complex server side application.

43:09.980 --> 43:10.980
It's fast moving.

43:10.980 --> 43:12.620
I mean it has a lot of active development.

43:12.620 --> 43:17.500
It's several different clients that are all independently developed.

43:17.500 --> 43:19.320
And that's a bit of complexity.

43:19.320 --> 43:22.780
And then of course there's this Federation aspect, which is another bit of complexity.

43:22.780 --> 43:25.940
So there's really like three layers to the Matrix dip.

43:25.940 --> 43:28.940
I'm not saying you shouldn't self host or anything like that.

43:28.940 --> 43:31.300
But you just need to be aware of these things.

43:31.300 --> 43:36.460
So of course one of the ways that the Matrix network can verify your server is legitimate

43:36.460 --> 43:39.500
in the Federation, is by verifying that server.

43:39.500 --> 43:43.380
And it'll do a lookup, it'll check your domain, and then one of your options, there's several

43:43.380 --> 43:46.060
options, but one of your options is to put a little file.

43:46.060 --> 43:49.780
Just a little couple of files like in a hidden directory inside another folder, and then

43:49.780 --> 43:51.020
there's like a file in there.

43:51.020 --> 43:55.700
And in particular we've made this more complicated for ourselves as usual because we wanted like

43:55.700 --> 44:01.840
our usernames to be chris at jupitabroadcasting.com, but we're not hosting the server at jupitabroadcasting.com.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.520
It's got a separate subdomain for itself.

44:03.520 --> 44:07.060
So you need some of these little files to verify that and basically delegate from your

44:07.060 --> 44:09.320
real name to the name you want.

44:09.320 --> 44:12.260
Because we want to just have at jupitabroadcasting in our usernames.

44:12.260 --> 44:19.120
And so that was just living in the depths of our old WordPress website that's been

44:19.120 --> 44:23.380
running on ScaleEngine for like 13 years and just kind of got added.

44:23.380 --> 44:27.140
But because it's in a hidden folder, I think when some of the community members reviewed

44:27.140 --> 44:30.620
that folder, they didn't see it, it was a hidden folder, they didn't see it.

44:30.620 --> 44:35.780
And so we published the new website during office hours, everything goes live, and we're

44:35.780 --> 44:39.220
using the matrix chat room for the live show.

44:39.220 --> 44:44.820
We're chatting with people, we're voting on titles, everything's great.

44:44.820 --> 44:50.360
And then that evening, the matrix chat just kind of starts to slow down.

44:50.360 --> 44:55.620
And then the next day I notice, Wednesday, huh, the only people chatting are people on

44:55.620 --> 45:00.300
the server that have jupitabroadcasting.com accounts.

45:00.300 --> 45:02.940
And I'm talking to Wes, and Wes and I are like, what do you think, it's like a summer

45:02.940 --> 45:03.940
lull?

45:03.940 --> 45:04.940
You think people are just like...

45:04.940 --> 45:05.940
Yeah, we were debating.

45:05.940 --> 45:08.140
We were checking, server seems fine, pinging each other, it's like, okay.

45:08.140 --> 45:11.980
And it was odd because the volume recently on the server has been pretty consistent.

45:11.980 --> 45:15.460
If I look away for two minutes and look back, there's several unread threads.

45:15.460 --> 45:21.420
And so I'm like, okay, weird, but maybe healthy, maybe it's good, everybody's out.

45:21.420 --> 45:25.180
People are taking a break from being online, going and enjoying their friends and family

45:25.180 --> 45:26.740
or the outdoors.

45:26.740 --> 45:28.420
We hadn't changed anything on the matrix server.

45:28.420 --> 45:33.380
I mean, there hadn't been a new Synapse update for a bit and hadn't updated the Linux system

45:33.380 --> 45:34.380
on it.

45:34.380 --> 45:38.020
It's just been around there, which we did get around to, but Thursday, I'm off.

45:38.020 --> 45:41.420
I'm out driving all day because I'm looking for RV furniture.

45:41.420 --> 45:46.520
By the way, if you refurbish RV furniture in my area, contact me because I'm looking.

45:46.520 --> 45:49.940
And so I spent the whole day driving all over this here state looking for somebody who can

45:49.940 --> 45:50.940
do this.

45:50.940 --> 45:52.060
And I wasn't really paying attention to the matrix yet.

45:52.060 --> 45:55.800
So Friday I get in and I'm like, Wes, it's still totally dead.

45:55.800 --> 45:57.020
What's going on here?

45:57.020 --> 46:00.060
And I've also, people had PMed me asking for info.

46:00.060 --> 46:03.380
I've gotten back to them and then I was expecting to hear back from them and none of them had

46:03.380 --> 46:04.380
gotten back to me.

46:04.380 --> 46:05.380
I'm like, that's weird.

46:05.380 --> 46:09.020
I'm supposed to be recording a show here in a couple of hours.

46:09.020 --> 46:12.660
And so I start doing some troubleshooting and I realized, oh, our federation is broken.

46:12.660 --> 46:13.740
We're not federating.

46:13.740 --> 46:17.300
And so people who are on different servers like matrix.org or their home server can't

46:17.300 --> 46:19.060
get on our server anymore.

46:19.060 --> 46:22.780
But beautifully, because who wants to be troubled with air messages?

46:22.780 --> 46:23.900
There's no air.

46:23.900 --> 46:26.260
There's no air in element chat, right?

46:26.260 --> 46:28.020
There's no air on the other person's end.

46:28.020 --> 46:30.700
Perhaps if we dug through the server logs, there may have been an air, but there's like

46:30.700 --> 46:33.780
no outward like air to tell us something's wrong.

46:33.780 --> 46:36.420
And because the people were chatting with us during office hours, I didn't make the

46:36.420 --> 46:38.620
connection to the website immediately.

46:38.620 --> 46:41.680
But once I kind of like explained to you what was going on, you put the connection together

46:41.680 --> 46:44.540
pretty quick and realized we were missing a file.

46:44.540 --> 46:47.180
And then we figured out, then we had to figure out how to get it on the new site.

46:47.180 --> 46:48.180
Yeah.

46:48.180 --> 46:51.500
You know, we've got to go add the static file and make sure it's actually going to show

46:51.500 --> 46:52.500
up.

46:52.500 --> 46:53.500
Yep.

46:53.500 --> 46:54.500
This is when I turned into a developer.

46:54.500 --> 46:55.500
It was very exciting.

46:55.500 --> 46:56.500
Yeah.

46:56.500 --> 46:57.500
You got it.

46:57.500 --> 46:58.500
I mean, Hugo is ready for it, obviously.

46:58.500 --> 46:59.500
It has no problem serving static files.

46:59.500 --> 47:00.500
Yeah.

47:00.500 --> 47:03.580
So we just had to go, you know, find that little file, which really isn't much.

47:03.580 --> 47:08.020
Thankfully, now it's in Git and Git turns out can actually show you hidden files.

47:08.020 --> 47:09.020
No problem.

47:09.020 --> 47:10.580
So we won't go missing again.

47:10.580 --> 47:11.960
What a concept.

47:11.960 --> 47:13.860
And so now we know about it.

47:13.860 --> 47:14.900
Now we've documented it.

47:14.900 --> 47:16.660
Now it's there.

47:16.660 --> 47:21.440
And the matrix, you know, once we restored the file, things just started fixing itself.

47:21.440 --> 47:25.980
It just took a little bit and then all these messages started filtering in and we started,

47:25.980 --> 47:29.340
everybody got reconnected and it was like, oh, hey, I missed you.

47:29.340 --> 47:30.340
It is kind of neat though.

47:30.340 --> 47:34.600
You know, I mean, as confusing as it was for us dummies, just that like us, us messing

47:34.600 --> 47:38.220
up our server and some of our infrastructure, the community could just keep chatting away

47:38.220 --> 47:39.620
in the same places, right?

47:39.620 --> 47:42.020
That they didn't have to go down just because we mess things up.

47:42.020 --> 47:45.500
And that's, and that's really nice when we're still learning how to send apps.

47:45.500 --> 47:46.500
That is a good thing.

47:46.500 --> 47:50.380
And I suppose at first it just looks like we're just totally AFK for a few days and

47:50.380 --> 47:52.620
maybe they were all hoping we were taking an ice break.

47:52.620 --> 47:53.880
So it's back online.

47:53.880 --> 47:58.980
One other benefit is that Kyle Potts recently put in some end to end tests for the website,

47:58.980 --> 47:59.980
which is really cool.

47:59.980 --> 48:04.960
So there's some testing happening whenever you push to production and whenever you push

48:04.960 --> 48:06.880
a PR as well.

48:06.880 --> 48:12.580
And so Elray, which has been a real, been a real dream these last few weeks with the

48:12.580 --> 48:18.560
website has integrated some tests to make sure that that file exists in the future.

48:18.560 --> 48:23.600
And so if for some reason, you know, it vanishes again, that's part of our testing.

48:23.600 --> 48:27.720
And it'll come up with an error message before, you know, before we have to wait a few days

48:27.720 --> 48:29.200
and realize things are wrong.

48:29.200 --> 48:31.160
Would you guys fricking look at us?

48:31.160 --> 48:32.760
Would you just fricking look at us for a second?

48:32.760 --> 48:34.560
Hey, we might break fewer things next time.

48:34.560 --> 48:38.680
We've gone from like this rickety WordPress website that was literally collapsing on itself.

48:38.680 --> 48:39.680
It sure was.

48:39.680 --> 48:43.380
Where like a couple of us had access to it to now an entire community is building this

48:43.380 --> 48:47.000
website together and then building tests to validate the changes work and that we don't

48:47.000 --> 48:50.360
make that mistake again, like, would you just fricking look at us right now?

48:50.360 --> 48:51.640
I'm so proud of us.

48:51.640 --> 48:53.800
I am so proud of us right now.

48:53.800 --> 48:56.080
Community has been so great on this.

48:56.080 --> 49:01.560
And it's thrilling to be able to say that as a result of this project, other open source

49:01.560 --> 49:03.280
code was also improved.

49:03.280 --> 49:04.280
Definitely.

49:04.280 --> 49:05.280
That is for the show.

49:05.280 --> 49:06.280
That's just like a big deal.

49:06.280 --> 49:07.280
Like to be able to do this.

49:07.280 --> 49:12.360
And I actually, I kind of want to, I kind of want to take this mentality further if

49:12.360 --> 49:13.360
we can.

49:13.360 --> 49:17.920
I don't know how possible it is, but, you know, I think we could open source elements

49:17.920 --> 49:18.920
of the show.

49:18.920 --> 49:23.000
I think the soundboard clips for like the boost and stuff, if, if there's soundboard

49:23.000 --> 49:27.520
bites that people don't like, well, why couldn't we have like people submitting a couple of

49:27.520 --> 49:32.040
different ideas on GitHub for a different soundboard file or ideas or something like

49:32.040 --> 49:33.040
that.

49:33.040 --> 49:36.360
So I've been trying to think of like how we could extend this concept more.

49:36.360 --> 49:40.400
So what do you think Brent, as somebody who's been diving into GitHub a lot and using it

49:40.400 --> 49:44.400
for different things, is this something we could extend to elements of a show segment?

49:44.400 --> 49:46.360
Yeah, I think you're onto something.

49:46.360 --> 49:50.600
What I've really enjoyed about the website is that this like collective brain that we've

49:50.600 --> 49:55.920
created through all the collaborators that we have working on on this site, it's been

49:55.920 --> 50:01.480
amazing to watch all of the different ideas come in and it's because we all had different

50:01.480 --> 50:05.160
personalities and we all care about, you know, someone might visit the website on their mobile

50:05.160 --> 50:10.780
phone and they're really sensitive to the padding on the website.

50:10.780 --> 50:14.760
And so they'll put in an issue on that where I browse through it, I'm like, I don't know.

50:14.760 --> 50:20.600
So what's been interesting is that collectively, we're a pretty amazing little engine making

50:20.600 --> 50:24.880
some some amazing tweaks and observations to the website and just making it better and

50:24.880 --> 50:29.080
better and better through everyone's diverse interests.

50:29.080 --> 50:34.880
And so I don't see why that wouldn't work for elements of the show, or maybe it's improving

50:34.880 --> 50:40.360
the voting on gamma bot that we have running live on the shows.

50:40.360 --> 50:44.520
You know, I think there are many opportunities for a bunch of people to get involved and

50:44.520 --> 50:49.780
do some of the value for value stuff that we've been suggesting and just improve JB

50:49.780 --> 50:50.780
for everyone.

50:50.780 --> 50:52.480
I think that sounds amazing to me.

50:52.480 --> 50:53.480
Right?

50:53.480 --> 50:55.440
I mean, we're making we're making the show for the audience, right?

50:55.440 --> 50:58.200
We're not just here for our own for our own.

50:58.200 --> 51:02.800
So I mean, if the audience can help make the show that they want, how is that not awesome?

51:02.800 --> 51:07.840
We really will you help me will you create a an area for Linux unplugged and an issue

51:07.840 --> 51:09.920
for the baller boost theme?

51:09.920 --> 51:13.920
Sure, while we're doing just thank you, because I think that's a great way to go.

51:13.920 --> 51:15.880
It's so because I want to put a link in the show notes.

51:15.880 --> 51:17.840
So if people want to participate in that, let's start there.

51:17.840 --> 51:18.840
I've never loved it.

51:18.840 --> 51:19.840
And we all have a boost.

51:19.840 --> 51:20.840
We'll get to there.

51:20.840 --> 51:21.840
We'll talk about that in a moment.

51:21.840 --> 51:25.880
But I just think this could be an option for us to all collectively make the show better.

51:25.880 --> 51:27.720
So I want to give it a shot.

51:27.720 --> 51:29.040
Let's give it a shake, guys.

51:29.040 --> 51:30.800
Let's see what happens.

51:30.800 --> 51:34.600
So just one more thing before we move on while we're talking about matrix and we're talking

51:34.600 --> 51:37.300
about GitHub and Hugo and all of that.

51:37.300 --> 51:40.760
It was it was noted by Oh, Walker in the chat room.

51:40.760 --> 51:46.900
He says I'm watching Linux unplugged on peer tube while chatting about it on matrix.

51:46.900 --> 51:48.600
It's absolutely glorious.

51:48.600 --> 51:52.200
And of course, we have the low latency quiet listening on mumble.

51:52.200 --> 51:57.360
We're doing this entire stream now on decentralized free software.

51:57.360 --> 51:59.800
mumble is centralized on our own server, but there's lots of people that have their own

51:59.800 --> 52:00.800
mumble server.

52:00.800 --> 52:03.000
So it's decentralized in that respect.

52:03.000 --> 52:07.640
Matrix decentralized, peer tube decentralized, and it's all free software.

52:07.640 --> 52:11.620
And we made a couple of bets this year on our technology stacks.

52:11.620 --> 52:13.800
We kind of we kind of made a commitment.

52:13.800 --> 52:17.240
We kind of decided matrix was something we were going to pursue this year.

52:17.240 --> 52:18.920
And we kind of made a bet on it.

52:18.920 --> 52:21.780
And we kind of made a bet on peer tube again.

52:21.780 --> 52:24.100
And I think that's paying off.

52:24.100 --> 52:26.480
And we've made a bet on boosts more.

52:26.480 --> 52:29.040
And I think that's gaining steam and paying off.

52:29.040 --> 52:32.880
Like I feel I'm feeling really good about all of these technologies and all of them

52:32.880 --> 52:36.280
are about decentralization, which has been a big theme for me.

52:36.280 --> 52:40.480
And not only have we been able to pick the platforms that are free and decentralized

52:40.480 --> 52:44.520
and under the creator's control, but the audience is adopting them more and more willingly

52:44.520 --> 52:47.400
to like, feels like a pretty big win.

52:47.400 --> 52:50.080
Just look at I think every now and you got to reflect on them W's, you know, because

52:50.080 --> 52:53.040
usually we just move right along and don't think about it, but you know, it's pretty

52:53.040 --> 52:54.040
great.

52:54.040 --> 52:57.480
Well, that's I mean, it's just real nice to have some of the things that we opine about

52:57.480 --> 53:04.440
so often here on the show, really put into practice and working so darn well.

53:04.440 --> 53:07.120
And now it is time for the boost.

53:07.120 --> 53:12.800
We got 5000 sats from John a he says, Hey, it's my first boost to Graham.

53:12.800 --> 53:16.020
I'm going to check out peer tube next.

53:16.020 --> 53:19.000
Great work pushing these decentralized systems.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
Love it.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
Nice.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
Thank you, John.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
That's a very on topic boost.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.800
Look at how that happened.

53:25.800 --> 53:32.600
Next up from the golden dragon 1024 sats or one one kilo set.

53:32.600 --> 53:33.600
I don't know.

53:33.600 --> 53:34.600
Yeah.

53:34.600 --> 53:35.600
Is that a gigabyte set?

53:35.600 --> 53:41.160
Maybe I'll give him a little hard drive.

53:41.160 --> 53:44.280
Boosting while listening to coder 481.

53:44.280 --> 53:46.400
I can be the love mascot.

53:46.400 --> 53:48.760
Here's a partial list of resume pieces.

53:48.760 --> 53:51.960
I got that rove ducks thing moving in the community.

53:51.960 --> 53:54.360
Dragons are powerful.

53:54.360 --> 53:57.300
And oh, why not?

53:57.300 --> 54:02.680
Just like Egon said, what does the world come to where your podcast doesn't have a mascot?

54:02.680 --> 54:08.000
So that is embarrassing because Coder Radio has a mascot and I think it's pretty embarrassing

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
that this show does.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
Are we worse than Coder?

54:10.000 --> 54:12.320
Is that what you're trying to tell us?

54:12.320 --> 54:14.960
Those jerks on the street, you're going to offend Brent.

54:14.960 --> 54:16.960
Those jerks only have two hosts over on that show.

54:16.960 --> 54:18.000
We got three hosts.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.780
This show deserves a mascot.

54:19.780 --> 54:22.480
And I think golden dragon deserves credit for getting the duck ball rolling.

54:22.480 --> 54:26.200
So now golden dragon, I mean, you've got to realize this is a commitment.

54:26.200 --> 54:29.120
You got to have a social media presence from time to time.

54:29.120 --> 54:33.000
You got to come to events because the whole thing about having a mascot is you need to

54:33.000 --> 54:36.360
be able to walk up to other podcasters and ask them if they have a mascot.

54:36.360 --> 54:40.360
And if they don't have a mascot for their podcast, you get to just harrumph and walk

54:40.360 --> 54:41.360
away.

54:41.360 --> 54:45.720
You know, so you got to really, you know, master that face where you just judge them

54:45.720 --> 54:46.720
a little bit.

54:46.720 --> 54:51.000
Oh, oh, oh.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
So practice that.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
Are you good, Brent?

54:53.000 --> 54:56.120
You good with a golden dragon being the official podcast mascot of the unplugged program?

54:56.120 --> 54:57.120
Well, I think so.

54:57.120 --> 55:00.840
Yeah, that's a pretty, uh, pretty fancy resume, so, but send in a video.

55:00.840 --> 55:02.320
We'd love to see it.

55:02.320 --> 55:08.320
Margie boosts in with 5,000 sets been listening and loving for years.

55:08.320 --> 55:14.500
Usually I enjoy the jingles on the show, though for some reason the back home baller clips

55:14.500 --> 55:21.840
really rubbed me the wrong way.

55:21.840 --> 55:26.520
So I was wondering if it's possible to maybe gauge the temperature of audience sentiment

55:26.520 --> 55:27.520
on this.

55:27.520 --> 55:32.320
If it's just a minority that it annoys or just me, I'll pipe down and just fast forward

55:32.320 --> 55:33.320
through that part.

55:33.320 --> 55:34.320
No worries.

55:34.320 --> 55:35.320
Margie goes on here.

55:35.320 --> 55:39.400
Maybe if I was part of the matrix server, I could pull the community myself, though

55:39.400 --> 55:41.720
to my shame, I've never quite gotten around.

55:41.720 --> 55:43.280
I love he's being hard on himself.

55:43.280 --> 55:47.160
I mean, thank you for boosting and thank you for listening for us.

55:47.160 --> 55:48.440
We love all of that.

55:48.440 --> 55:49.440
Yeah.

55:49.440 --> 55:50.440
Also for being so reasonable.

55:50.440 --> 55:51.440
It's like, well, if you don't want to change it.

55:51.440 --> 55:52.440
Okay.

55:52.440 --> 55:53.440
I don't love it.

55:53.440 --> 55:56.520
It's I think Saturday Night Live fans will probably recognize it.

55:56.520 --> 55:59.720
It's it's a it's from a funny skit on Saturday Night Live.

55:59.720 --> 56:05.800
But you know what I'm trying to think what when you think of a big spender or a big baller,

56:05.800 --> 56:08.960
like what imagery do you invoke and what sound goes with that?

56:08.960 --> 56:10.840
Do we need some like cash register sounds?

56:10.840 --> 56:14.320
Do we need some like I think it needs to be I think it needs to be kind of iconic.

56:14.320 --> 56:15.320
We want to honor them.

56:15.320 --> 56:16.320
Right.

56:16.320 --> 56:17.320
Yeah.

56:17.320 --> 56:20.320
The point I think it needs to be like a sound like a sound bite from a movie or something

56:20.320 --> 56:24.240
that is recognizable and memorable and not annoying.

56:24.240 --> 56:28.360
So that's where I think we open that up as like maybe one of the first like pull requests

56:28.360 --> 56:32.260
where the community can submit ideas to the show and then we can modify the show based

56:32.260 --> 56:33.420
on whichever one we go with.

56:33.420 --> 56:36.560
I think that's an opportunity there because I don't love it, but I don't know what else

56:36.560 --> 56:38.120
to replace it with.

56:38.120 --> 56:40.040
So I'll take input from that.

56:40.040 --> 56:41.600
But thank you, Margie.

56:41.600 --> 56:45.560
Woden wrote in with 5000 sats coming in hot with the blues.

56:45.560 --> 56:52.240
As always, loving the show I've got a long 10 hour each way plus kids end of summer road

56:52.240 --> 56:57.620
trip coming up and would love your guys recommendation on what parts of any of the J.B. shows back

56:57.620 --> 57:00.760
catalog would make a good listen during the drive.

57:00.760 --> 57:03.280
Any specific series of episodes?

57:03.280 --> 57:06.680
Happy to take recommendations from my fellow listeners as well.

57:06.680 --> 57:09.360
Just take me in the J.B. chat matrix room.

57:09.360 --> 57:10.360
What in 501?

57:10.360 --> 57:15.160
You know, would it be interesting if we had series like the system D series of unplugged

57:15.160 --> 57:17.520
would that be interesting?

57:17.520 --> 57:18.520
I'd listen.

57:18.520 --> 57:21.840
I think one way to do it might be with the tags that we put on each episode.

57:21.840 --> 57:26.440
You know, if you're interested in a particular topic, you know, we have this summer of immutability

57:26.440 --> 57:31.280
that would be perhaps a way to get a series of episodes customized to your interests.

57:31.280 --> 57:35.520
Another tool to help find some of that might be notes dot Jupiter broadcasting dot com

57:35.520 --> 57:38.720
to kind of dig through all of that stuff.

57:38.720 --> 57:44.100
I'd probably go completionist and probably just look back for over the last year or something.

57:44.100 --> 57:48.000
Or like if you're new to the network, one thing that might be interesting is to try

57:48.000 --> 57:53.400
to find the episodes of Linux Unplugged where we announced the merger and acquisition.

57:53.400 --> 57:56.840
And then the Linux Unplugged where we announced that we've gone or maybe that I don't know

57:56.840 --> 58:00.480
if there's I guess there might be a Linux Unplugged where we announced the ACG acquisition.

58:00.480 --> 58:01.480
I don't know.

58:01.480 --> 58:02.480
Maybe not.

58:02.480 --> 58:04.680
And then, you know, find the one where we go independent again.

58:04.680 --> 58:06.320
That'd be an interesting little arc.

58:06.320 --> 58:09.360
You're thinking like epochs of Linux Unplugged.

58:09.360 --> 58:11.560
Yeah, that could be another way to go.

58:11.560 --> 58:15.300
Or like, you know, there's there's a stretch of the West era on CoderRadio.

58:15.300 --> 58:17.680
If you haven't caught that, that might be interesting because people love the coding

58:17.680 --> 58:18.680
challenges from that era.

58:18.680 --> 58:19.680
Oh, that was fun.

58:19.680 --> 58:20.680
It comes up all the time.

58:20.680 --> 58:21.680
So that could be good.

58:21.680 --> 58:26.120
I think there's some really neat live episodes that we've done that have a little bit of

58:26.120 --> 58:27.120
a different energy.

58:27.120 --> 58:33.320
And, you know, the one we did System76 last year, for instance, had a lot of people who

58:33.320 --> 58:35.200
were just at the tour.

58:35.200 --> 58:36.800
And that was a fun go.

58:36.800 --> 58:37.800
Yeah.

58:37.800 --> 58:38.800
So extras dot show.

58:38.800 --> 58:41.240
There's a bunch of bonus content over there.

58:41.240 --> 58:45.040
And then there's Jupiter Dot Tube as well for just like if you actually want to see

58:45.040 --> 58:48.000
how we make the shows and video.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
That's over there as well.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.880
I'm going to recommend taking some brunches.

58:51.880 --> 58:54.800
There's some really great ones in there that are perfect for a road trip.

58:54.800 --> 58:56.640
They're pretty evergreen, I would say.

58:56.640 --> 58:57.640
And that's a good way to go.

58:57.640 --> 58:58.640
Yeah.

58:58.640 --> 58:59.640
How come we didn't think of that?

58:59.640 --> 59:00.640
Yeah.

59:00.640 --> 59:01.640
Go make sure you've caught up on all the brunches.

59:01.640 --> 59:02.640
Those are always really great.

59:02.640 --> 59:07.120
And some of them are perfect, I think, road show content as well.

59:07.120 --> 59:08.960
You know, that listening while you're driving.

59:08.960 --> 59:12.920
And I mean, the guests are diverse, so you got you got all kinds of different topics.

59:12.920 --> 59:13.920
All right.

59:13.920 --> 59:14.920
Moving right along.

59:14.920 --> 59:18.000
Mississippi Mayhem boosted in with eight thousand sats.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
Boost!

59:19.000 --> 59:23.520
I'm cleaning out my fountain wallet because I'm setting up my own node to use Boost CLI.

59:23.520 --> 59:25.840
You gotta love command line software.

59:25.840 --> 59:28.120
That's full geek self-hosted mode right there.

59:28.120 --> 59:29.400
Sure is.

59:29.400 --> 59:32.640
We asked for feedback about folks' endless OS usage.

59:32.640 --> 59:36.760
He writes, I took one on a deployment to Africa back in 2017.

59:36.760 --> 59:40.120
It wasn't great, but then again, I'm not the typical use case.

59:40.120 --> 59:43.680
I eventually wiped the computer and gave it to a local man because I had a second one

59:43.680 --> 59:44.680
with me.

59:44.680 --> 59:47.680
He says, I wish I could be more descriptive, but I don't have enough characters.

59:47.680 --> 59:51.760
What I'll say, though, is I'd love to try it again, maybe as a bedrock strata.

59:51.760 --> 59:52.760
Oh, nice.

59:52.760 --> 59:55.000
Interesting idea, Mayhem.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.600
I like that.

59:56.600 --> 01:00:03.040
Green Eagle boosted in with three thousand three hundred and thirty three sats.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:07.320
He says, with no commute, I listen to the podcast while doing chores around the house

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:11.720
and I just finished episode 471 two days ago, so I'm not very current.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:12.720
And this got me thinking.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.040
I wanted to ask other people, how far behind are you?

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.040
Yeah.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.040
What's your average leg time?

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.040
Yeah.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.240
Which means we're going to hear from them in a couple of weeks, probably.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.240
And then see you in 2024.

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:25.960
I hope they're not that far behind, Wes.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.160
That would be too bad.

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:34.920
And then Green Eagle boosted in with a double boost, a row of ducks, two thousand two hundred

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:35.920
and twenty two sats.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:40.120
He says, I tried for two days to get sats into Podverse, but I ended up using Breeze,

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:43.560
which only took an evening to get sats set up.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.560
Yeah, thank you.

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.640
I know some of you out there do struggle with this.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.660
And so the fact that we're asking you to do this crazy thing and then you also spend so

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:53.240
much time getting it working, that really is putting a lot of effort and value into

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.240
this.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:57.640
And once you get it set up, it is like greased lightning.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:01.040
It just is super easy, super smooth.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.960
But I know every now and then it can be challenging.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:09.520
My current favorite like privacy focused way to get those sats is I go to RoboSats.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:12.360
And if you Google search RoboSats, you can find their educational website will tell you

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.040
everything you need to know.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:20.000
You can work with the moon wallet, M U U N. That works between Bitcoin and lightning and

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.720
just manages all that for you.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.960
It's super easy to get RoboSats, get them in your app, and there will be no trace when

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:26.960
you do that.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.480
Of course, there's other options like strike and blue wallet where you can buy it through

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.480
the conventional means.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:34.520
You just have to identify yourself, which some people are totally cool with.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:39.360
I think another way to do it as well that would be pretty user friendly is using fountain

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:44.360
and collecting some sats as you listen to podcasts you likely already listen to, including

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.360
this year show.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.700
And then, you know, once you've collected those, you can send them to whichever show

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.760
you want.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:54.760
The pro tip on fountain is if you go look in your profile, they have this screen called

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.280
flow.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:00.960
And you just that kind of tells you it's in the little hamburger menu.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:05.620
And that flow bar tells you what your kind of sat earn rate is going to be.

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:10.760
And you can up your flow by listening to clips, by clipping shows, by boosting, doing all

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.800
of that basically by participating in the app community.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:18.520
You up your flow and then you earn sats as you listen.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.320
I have switched to Podverse as my daily player.

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:29.080
But even still, when I was using fountain, I earned forty one thousand five hundred and

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:34.020
fifteen sats just by listening to podcasts that I was going to listen to already.

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:35.020
So that is a great way.

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:38.840
And then I hear that a lot in the booths, I see people, you know, boosting in the sats

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:39.840
I earned in fountain.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.200
And it's just a circular system.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.200
You don't even have to leave it.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.280
But you just have to listen to a lot of podcasts today.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.120
I suspect some of you do that anyway.

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:50.200
It might just be easier to go to newpodcastapps.com and just grab a podcast app and do it that

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.200
way.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.640
Gene Bean was really generous this week, boosting in kind of thoughts as he was listening.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.400
You know, it's one of the advantages of having the button right there in the app is you can

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.680
just give your feedback right away.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.560
He wants somebody to package up Google Teller and link it up if they would.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:04.600
And he said he'd also be down to hear more about Ham Radio.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:08.160
I'm still trying to take the temperature on the audience on Ham Radio.

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:11.280
I have a sense we'll hear a lot from people who do want to hear about it, but I don't

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.960
know if we're going to hear from people who don't.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.560
And I'd like to hear from both.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:20.500
And then lastly, Mega Strike 3 sent a congrats to all the JPL winners, which is so awesome.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:24.040
We had people who didn't get their name pulled, but they were still super cool about it and

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.040
congratulating everybody.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.040
Yeah, we wish.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.720
I mean, we obviously wish we could take everyone.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.480
That's just so that part sucks.

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:32.220
But we're very glad we have such a courteous community.

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:35.840
And if you're a member at unpluggedcore.com or Jupiter Party, you're thinking, I want

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.840
to boost in.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.320
We do have that on our radar for hopefully towards the end of the year.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:45.060
And we also are discussing like a private matrix room, kind of kicking around the pros

01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:47.020
and cons of that still.

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.480
So we'll have an announcement for you pretty soon.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.200
But it might be post road trip.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.200
Just that way.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.720
I can only focus on so many things and that way I'll make sure we do it right.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:00.000
But thank you, everybody who supports us through a membership or by boosting into the show.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.620
And we do have a pick this week.

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:05.520
It was boosted in by listener John.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:11.440
He says it's a beautiful music player for Linux, works on Android and Windows with material

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.440
design.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:16.800
So uses flutter and MPV under the hood.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.880
It's really easy to get installed.

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:23.380
I don't know if it didn't seem like there was a flat pack anymore, but there are devs

01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:26.840
and rpms and a tar and I just needed to install lib MPV.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:27.840
I love MPV.

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:29.760
So that makes me fairly happy.

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.400
And then, yeah, it's got a kind of slick looks kind of like an online Google app might, you

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:38.920
know, I actually think it looks like an iteration ago of Spotify's UI.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:39.920
Oh, yeah.

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.380
But, you know, not Spotify.

01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:44.600
So like the elements of Spotify I like, but it was really easy to get going.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:48.140
Like I just had to go by default to look under your home doors music folder.

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:51.320
I don't actually have anything on there right now, but I pointed it at my downloads folder

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.480
and I mean it automatically in no time at all.

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:54.920
It's reading all the metadata.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.040
It's finding images of it.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:00.420
It's showing I have some of our podcast and I found those no problem.

01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.360
So that's great.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.440
All right.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:07.200
So it does podcasts, too, or at least it recognizes podcasts.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:13.760
Harmanoid, harmanoid, H-R-M-O-N-O-I-D dot com.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:14.760
Harmanoid for that.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:21.960
Well, um, are you guys, either one of you still using like a jukebox on your desktop?

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.560
Does anybody do that still?

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:29.740
I do it occasionally, but sometimes, yeah, I do from time to time, especially when I'm

01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:35.240
trying to focus for many hours on something like, for instance, Jupiter Broadcasting's

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:41.120
new website and I find having, you know, my favorite music, that really works for me having

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.560
my favorite music just kind of either in a loop or a few albums that I know really well

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.100
just playing in the background.

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:52.840
That's a really nice thing for me and I find still, you know, not having to play it in

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:57.660
a web page or something like that is just, there's some simplicity there and some integrations

01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:00.620
with, with, you know, media keys on your keyboard or something like that.

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:04.620
So there's, there's still something there that is nice and I've been using Clementine

01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:08.880
for a while, you know, pick whichever app you want, but I think there's still a place

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:09.880
for it.

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:10.880
Yeah.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:15.680
I also, I like it for focus music, basically stuff that isn't going to distract me and

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.320
isn't going to surprise me.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:20.640
I just find all of the automatic recommended music just sucks.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.000
Like it doesn't feel like it goes together.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.320
It's like music that's popular, but I, nothing does as well as like old Pandora did back in

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:27.320
the day.

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.320
Yeah.

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.320
Ain't that the truth?

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.320
With the music DNA.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.320
And I've still kind of got a core set.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:34.000
Like I don't mind using the streaming services for, you know, new albums that come out that

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.480
I want to try or just like random stuff to put on in the background.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:39.880
But I've got a core set of music that much like, you know, you might have some LPs at

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:42.840
home or whatever, like that you just collect cause you know, you'll kind of always want

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:43.840
to have around.

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:47.000
And ideally I can get those, you know, off Bandcamp or something and Flackfile.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.040
And so it's nice to have something that looks decent to play those when, when I want to.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.440
This is why I don't go any further with it because I'm like two minutes away from like,

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.600
I need Flack everything.

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.920
I need high fidelity, high quality, all my music gotta be Flack.

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:04.240
And then I'm like, I'm 200 gigs deep into Flackfiles on music and I listen to it like

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.100
once a month.

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:11.840
But I, you know, I, I know this sounds cliche, but you guys probably all saw that news story

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:17.240
about Google that reported the dad to police and shut down his account and sent over all

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:21.540
of his account contents because he was using telemedicine and took a picture of his son

01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:24.980
that Google deemed as child porn.

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:29.280
And being a dad and being somebody who uses telemedicine, I started thinking to myself

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.960
like, God, that could be me.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:37.500
And I think it was really the thing that made me realize we've gone too far.

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:41.760
And so now I'm thinking about music more and I'm thinking about my photos.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:45.460
And I kind of wanted to put the question out there to the audience.

01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:51.100
Have you solved photo backup on your phone that isn't just going to Nextcloud?

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:55.600
I'm not totally opposed to that solution, but I'd really like something like PhotoPrism,

01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:00.960
but that has a really good client that is automatically sucking up the phone's photos

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.600
from Android or iOS and saving them.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:08.120
And then I have a web UI, I can search for stuff and it doesn't have to be a complete

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.120
end-to-end solution.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:13.300
I'd be curious to know what people are just using to solve this problem because photos

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:15.720
is definitely just, I got to get that solved.

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:18.280
I keep sliding back to Google Photos.

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:19.280
Yeah, right.

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.680
There might be some stuff you don't care about, like your listening habits that you're okay

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:26.240
with people knowing about in the cloud, but photos are pretty personal.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.240
Yeah.

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:31.160
And I also, I realized over the years that I've taken photos of people who implicitly

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:33.980
have chosen never to be online in any form.

01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:37.400
And if they're in my Google Photos, then now Google knows about them.

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:40.000
And then somebody else uploads a photo of them and then Google can start networking

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
it.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:47.000
And I'm like, I'm compromising other people's OPSEC basically, you know, including my own.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000
So let us know, send a boost into the show or go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.640
How are you solving automatic photo backup on your phone?

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.640
And did you use Kexec?

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:56.640
Because I hope so.

01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:58.600
Brennan, you must be playing around with this kind of stuff.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:02.240
Well, you know, I was actually remembering an episode that we did.

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:08.080
I believe it may have been of Linux Unplugged now that Alex did some deep dives of alternatives

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.140
to Google Photos.

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:13.760
I believe that may have been six months ago, maybe even a year ago.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:17.560
Someone should go to notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com and let me know which one.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:21.240
But I remember he dove into a bunch of alternatives that were self-hosted.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.240
And there were some that were good.

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:27.320
There was some AI tooling in there to do a bunch of recognizing of faces and objects

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.760
and hot dogs and such.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:33.500
And I think back then it wasn't quite where he was happy.

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:37.620
But I'm curious now, I wonder where it's come in that last six months.

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:41.920
And that was episode 409, launch your memories into the future.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:47.200
And Photoprism, which we talk about in that episode, is a really good solution, but it

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:50.000
isn't the complete solution.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:55.960
And I think that's the piece I'm missing, especially on iOS, because iOS is such a jerk

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.440
about background processes.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:03.020
So getting the files off the phone, but then also something that has a workflow for bigger

01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:06.440
picture photos that you import off an SD card.

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.120
You want to be able to have one unified photo collection, right?

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.120
Ideally.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.120
And I could use Prism.

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:12.120
I don't mind.

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:15.320
If I need to like hodgepodge this, kind of like we talked about in that episode, I could

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.320
go that route.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:19.540
But I'm just, I'm curious if anybody else has a better solution now.

01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:23.080
Maybe they don't, but if we hear something, we'll pass it along for those of you listening

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:24.080
to that way.

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.080
Yeah.

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:26.080
Hey, one more problem to solve as a group.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.080
Yeah.

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:28.080
Let's solve it together, everybody.

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:32.600
I remember if you want more show, you can become a member, then you get a recorded extended

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:36.560
version of the show that has a live show and a post show, a lot more.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:41.200
We also archive the sausage as it's made over at jupyter.tube if you want to check it out.

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:44.760
And then there's only one really big pro tip we should leave everybody with, Wes.

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.200
Like the one tip you should take away from this week's episode.

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:48.920
Do you know what it is?

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.400
Better get your antivirus sorted.

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:51.400
Okay.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.400
There's two tips.

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.400
Antivirus tip.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:54.400
See you next week.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:00.360
Same bat time, same bat station.

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:03.880
And of course, linuxactionnews.com.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.640
Join us live, hang out here, and then when we're all done, you go over to linuxactionnews.com,

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.640
you catch up on the news.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.640
Yeah.

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:11.640
How about that?

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:14.320
Less fussing around, just what you need to know.

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.320
That's what I would do.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.320
Tell you what.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.840
Actually, I mean, we were listening to something before the show.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.880
So you already got your Linux Action News site for the day.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.880
You're right.

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.880
We did it before the show.

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:23.880
That is true.

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.880
That's documented.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.880
We got the receipts.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:26.880
All right.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:27.880
Details and links, I don't know.

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.840
Stuff we talked about today, linuxunplugged.com, contact pages over there.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:34.720
Or check out the new website, jupitabroadcasting.com.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:35.880
We got links over there now.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880
It's so impressive.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.520
Thanks so much for joining us.

01:11:38.520 --> 01:12:06.320
See you right back here next Sunday.

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:21.240
Have we officially moved 100% to the matrix, sir, for this?

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:22.240
This is right.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:23.240
Yes.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.240
Right.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.000
This is our first show where we did the live chat on matrix.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.240
Coder made the jump first and it seemed to go smooth.

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:29.600
Office Hours really made the jump first.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:30.600
Well, come on.

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.540
Coder was the first long-running live show.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:33.540
And now LUP.

01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:35.520
You know, and Coder has the mask on.

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.480
I don't know what's going on over there.

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:39.240
And they're probably going to get to 500 first, too.

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.960
That's just some big Coder energy lately.

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:41.960
I know.

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.360
Maybe we should start doing double episodes, two a week, to catch up so we can get to 500

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.360
first.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:47.360
Okay.

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.360
Okay.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.360
Oh, I was thinking Sabotage would be the other way to go.

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:52.200
Oh, that's way easier.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.760
We send Brent down to Florida.

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:54.760
Yeah.

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.480
We get him a Jar Jar costume.

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.480
Right?

01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.480
Hmm.

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:02.920
Put some squirrels in his walls, you know, and see what happens.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:05.040
Yeah, I think he'll get there.

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.040
I think it's going to be awesome.

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.760
I can't wait for 500.

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.760
That's such a big number.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.400
I don't think any of my shows have ever made it to 500.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.920
So that's a landmark.

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.680
And I wonder if I'll make it to a thousand one day for any of my shows.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.680
Oh, I bet you will.

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:17.680
You think so?

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:18.680
Uh-huh.

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.680
If I survive.

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:40.200
Well, you got to.
