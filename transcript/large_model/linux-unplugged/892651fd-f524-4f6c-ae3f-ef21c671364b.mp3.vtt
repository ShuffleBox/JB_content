WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.480
You'd think I'd know that I eat three times a day

00:02.480 --> 00:03.940
and that I'd plan for that,

00:03.940 --> 00:05.700
and you'd think I'd plan for a pre-show

00:05.700 --> 00:07.680
because I've only been doing this for like, what?

00:07.680 --> 00:09.680
Oh, we're going on eight years now?

00:09.680 --> 00:11.240
You think maybe?

00:11.240 --> 00:13.320
I kinda doubt you eat three meals a day.

00:13.320 --> 00:15.080
I am just so distracted.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.080
See, behind the scenes,

00:16.080 --> 00:20.360
there's a big production issue with the show.

00:20.360 --> 00:23.360
We don't have a ritual getting started song

00:23.360 --> 00:24.400
figured out yet. That's true.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.600
And it's just consuming a lot of cycles.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.360
And I don't wanna blame anyone.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.400
No, you shouldn't. In particular, no.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.700
But it's just throwing off the pre-show.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.040
I think that's what it is, right?

00:34.040 --> 00:35.940
Well, all our energy is focused elsewhere,

00:35.940 --> 00:37.680
so we're not giving the pre-show.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.740
We're still trying to figure out what song to have

00:39.740 --> 00:41.120
before we start the show.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.640
I think maybe later we gotta take the pre-show

00:42.640 --> 00:44.520
out to dinner, maybe kind of apologize,

00:44.520 --> 00:46.320
try to make that get on good graces again.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.060
Yeah, we better pick up flowers too.

00:48.060 --> 00:49.960
And you know, those are going up in price right now.

00:49.960 --> 00:50.800
Sure are.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.620
Ah!

00:51.620 --> 01:06.560
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:06.560 --> 01:07.560
My name is Chris.

01:07.560 --> 01:08.560
My name is Wes.

01:08.560 --> 01:09.560
And my name is Brent.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.360
Hello, gentlemen.

01:11.360 --> 01:13.560
Coming up on this week's episode,

01:13.560 --> 01:17.360
is there a new king of Linux laptops?

01:17.360 --> 01:20.360
We've got the HP Dev 1 in studio right now.

01:20.360 --> 01:23.360
We've been putting it under a battery of tests.

01:23.360 --> 01:26.360
And I'll give you my most in-depth review of a laptop

01:26.360 --> 01:29.360
I've ever done in 15 years of podcasting yet.

01:29.360 --> 01:32.360
Even if you're not in the market for some Linux hardware,

01:32.360 --> 01:34.360
I'd like you to keep listening.

01:34.360 --> 01:37.360
I think you should probably be informed about this laptop

01:37.360 --> 01:39.360
and maybe keep in the back of your mind

01:39.360 --> 01:42.360
when you or someone you know is looking for Linux-first hardware.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.360
And then after we talk about that,

01:44.360 --> 01:46.360
we'll round out the show with some great boosts,

01:46.360 --> 01:48.360
some picks, and some more.

01:48.360 --> 01:51.360
I think you just said I have to hide my wallet for this episode.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.360
Yeah, I know, right?

01:52.360 --> 01:53.360
Or find yours, maybe.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.360
You've got it right there in front of you right now, Wes Payne.

01:56.360 --> 01:57.360
That's right, yeah.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.360
So you be careful, because once you start using it, that's when it...

01:59.360 --> 02:01.360
I should have brought, like, a decoy laptop I could have set here,

02:01.360 --> 02:03.360
and then you just wouldn't notice for a couple days

02:03.360 --> 02:04.360
till I'd left the studio with it.

02:04.360 --> 02:06.360
I think a funny thing about this laptop is

02:06.360 --> 02:09.360
it's not great at first impressions.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.360
It's once you get to know it that you start to like it.

02:12.360 --> 02:15.360
And we'll talk about that and why.

02:15.360 --> 02:18.360
And then, of course, of course, we can't do a show

02:18.360 --> 02:21.360
without having our backup crew, our virtual lug.

02:21.360 --> 02:23.360
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.360
Hello. Hello, Chris. Hello, Wes. Hello, Brent.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.360
Hello, darlings.

02:26.360 --> 02:29.360
I'm actually shocked we have this many people in there,

02:29.360 --> 02:31.360
because we started an hour early.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.360
We didn't tell anyone until, like, the day of.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.360
I mean, that's some charitable rounding, but yeah, you know,

02:36.360 --> 02:37.360
we started early today.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.360
Yeah, yeah.

02:38.360 --> 02:41.360
Well, we would still be shooting the S traditionally,

02:41.360 --> 02:44.360
so we're doing a double-lup recording because I'm leaving.

02:44.360 --> 02:49.360
I'm taking the little family to Montana for some good swimming.

02:49.360 --> 02:52.360
And so I'll be gone for almost two weeks, about a week and a half.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.360
So we won't have a live show next week,

02:54.360 --> 02:57.360
but we will have a released episode.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.360
And of course, we'll have something for our members.

02:59.360 --> 03:03.360
But this weekend, I was trying to get my Starlink game all figured out

03:03.360 --> 03:07.360
because you guys know I've got this ongoing saga

03:07.360 --> 03:09.360
where I had a Starlink motor fail on me,

03:09.360 --> 03:11.360
so my antenna didn't work.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.360
Tragic.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.360
And then I replaced it with a round dish.

03:14.360 --> 03:18.360
I got another round dish, and that dish didn't work.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.360
And now they've sent me a brand new square dishy.

03:20.360 --> 03:23.360
And so I've been kind of re-gearing up around this.

03:23.360 --> 03:28.360
And I've come up with this wackadoodle flagpole mount system, you guys.

03:28.360 --> 03:33.360
So I got this cheap flagpole from Harbor Freight.

03:33.360 --> 03:40.360
And on Etsy, I bought a, like, $6, after shipping, it was like $30,

03:40.360 --> 03:46.360
a $6 adapter that's 3D printed that lets the Starlink dish mount

03:46.360 --> 03:48.360
at the top of the flagpole.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.360
Oh, nice.

03:49.360 --> 03:53.360
And then I got some clasps to connect that flagpole

03:53.360 --> 03:57.360
to big industrial suction cups that I'm just going right to the side of Lady Joops.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.360
This is going to be very fun.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.360
And then I'm going to get the antenna up above the RV

04:02.360 --> 04:06.360
because the big thing I've now learned with Starlink

04:06.360 --> 04:09.360
is you've got to have complete clearance of the sky.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.360
And you've got, even around the edges, some blockage,

04:11.360 --> 04:12.360
you're going to get lost packets.

04:12.360 --> 04:15.360
And when you're trying to, like, live stream or something, that doesn't work.

04:15.360 --> 04:18.360
Yeah, right. You're not just browsing the web here, you're running a network.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.360
Although on this trip, I will not be podcasting.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.360
So even if it's just decent, I'll be happy.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.360
So this is like a setup where, like, after you've found your spot for the night,

04:24.360 --> 04:27.360
you've parked, you get this out in the sun and just pop it onto the side?

04:27.360 --> 04:28.360
Yeah. I mean, that's the idea.

04:28.360 --> 04:33.360
The other mount I got is the flagpole can mount into a hitch adapter.

04:33.360 --> 04:37.360
So I put a flagpole mount into the hitch, and then the flagpole sits in that.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.360
Smart.

04:38.360 --> 04:39.360
Okay, question.

04:39.360 --> 04:42.360
If we were to get ourselves, say, a Jupiter broadcasting flag,

04:42.360 --> 04:44.360
could that still be attached to the flagpole?

04:44.360 --> 04:46.360
Yes. You can keep your flag, yep, and have your Starlink.

04:46.360 --> 04:47.360
Excellent.

04:47.360 --> 04:48.360
Yeah. Oh, we've got to do that now.

04:48.360 --> 04:49.360
Now we've got to announce.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.360
Anybody who designs flags, get in touch.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.360
LinuxUnplugged.com slash contact.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.360
A vexillologist?

04:55.360 --> 04:56.360
Yeah, I know.

04:56.360 --> 04:58.360
Random knowledge.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.360
Okay. I don't want that. I don't want that.

05:00.360 --> 05:01.360
I don't want to know that.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.360
But if that's you, we want you.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.360
Yes, that's true. Yeah, that is true.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.360
Yeah, we'll see, because the spot we're going to stay in, Montana,

05:07.360 --> 05:08.360
typically have no cell coverage.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.360
At least we haven't for, like, the last five years.

05:10.360 --> 05:13.360
And so this may be the first time where we have internet connectivity.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.360
For better or worse, we'll see.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.360
Or maybe I'll just never get around to mounting it.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.360
Sorry, kids.

05:20.360 --> 05:23.360
I hope the suction cups really work out, because as you're describing it,

05:23.360 --> 05:27.360
and as I'm trying to imagine you out there with this contraption,

05:27.360 --> 05:32.360
all I can picture is, like, Wiley Coyote trying to, I don't know,

05:32.360 --> 05:35.360
manufacture some kind of ACME device that's going to work for him.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.360
So hopefully it works out for you.

05:37.360 --> 05:40.360
I thought maybe a roof mount would work, you know, like sandbags.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.360
And I get a roof. I don't want to get up there.

05:42.360 --> 05:45.360
People I was reading on forums are like, no, it doesn't work.

05:45.360 --> 05:48.360
Those sandbags are such a pain in the ass to take up the ladder.

05:48.360 --> 05:49.360
Oh, yeah, that would get old.

05:49.360 --> 05:53.360
Plus the roof is probably not designed for all that weight sitting on there all the time.

05:53.360 --> 05:56.360
Yeah, the biggest challenge with the roof is that it's rubber

05:56.360 --> 05:58.360
and that you can damage it with a lot of things.

05:58.360 --> 06:02.360
It's rubber. I would have never expected that.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.360
Yeah, you can actually sit up there, you know.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.360
You can lounge up there if you want.

06:06.360 --> 06:07.360
Just got to be a little careful.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.360
Yeah, don't step on the damn solar panels.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.360
Damn it. Those are expensive.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.360
Yeah, but this is going to be my attempt.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.360
We'll see while I'm in Montana to see if I can get Dishy working,

06:15.360 --> 06:17.360
because now I've got a fully working setup.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.360
I got a little crate that I got for it.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.360
I took all the bits out of the box that it shipped with

06:21.360 --> 06:24.360
and I built a little crate for it to sit in.

06:24.360 --> 06:26.360
Like a go rig set up for it.

06:26.360 --> 06:30.360
I just really don't want this one to break, you know, like it was a long process.

06:30.360 --> 06:33.360
It took almost a month for all of this to get resolved.

06:33.360 --> 06:37.360
But I do want to say every time I interacted with Starlink support, it was really good.

06:37.360 --> 06:41.360
And one time they even called me just to like expedite everything because they knew I had been waiting.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.360
Oh, okay. Nice.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.360
And so I really got to give it to them.

06:43.360 --> 06:46.360
Like the downside is it took almost a month,

06:46.360 --> 06:49.360
but the upside is they were really reasonable to work with.

06:49.360 --> 06:55.360
They didn't like I could just tell them, yeah, I pinged this or I checked this or yes, the POE injector has power.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.360
Like and they just believed me and they didn't like.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.360
You didn't have to go through a bunch of rigmarole.

06:59.360 --> 07:00.360
Yeah.

07:00.360 --> 07:04.360
And it's so cool. It is really just such a neat set up in those things running Linux and all that.

07:04.360 --> 07:05.360
I just I love it so dang much.

07:05.360 --> 07:12.360
I'll put a link to some of the mounting options I considered if you are also out there looking for this kind of thing.

07:12.360 --> 07:15.360
But let's talk about the dev one.

07:15.360 --> 07:19.360
It's quite literally well, it's not an elephant because it's kind of svelte, but it's right here in the room with it.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.360
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.360
Give me a quick weight check there. What would you say?

07:22.360 --> 07:25.360
Average weight there more or less than the ThinkPad.

07:25.360 --> 07:29.360
Probably a little heavier, a little heavier, but it's got because it's got a nice kind of density to it.

07:29.360 --> 07:32.360
It's not, you know, annoyingly heavy.

07:32.360 --> 07:33.360
It's just it feels sturdy.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.360
Yeah, it is.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.360
Yeah, it's a really solid, really solid.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.360
In fact, if you press on it there, it doesn't really flex much at all.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.360
No, not much flex.

07:39.360 --> 07:44.360
I'm holding it just by one corner and it's not really, you know, whipping around like a madman.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.360
I'm not worried about doing it like, yeah, I'm not going to hurt it.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.360
So I want to give a little context to this review.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.360
This isn't a paid review.

07:50.360 --> 07:55.360
This is a review unit, but there's been no transaction from services or anything like that.

07:55.360 --> 08:04.360
I did have the opportunity to join a joint call between HP and System 76 with my co-host Michael Dominic from Coda Radio and ask some questions.

08:04.360 --> 08:09.360
But I've owned a lot of Linux machines, so that's the experience I'm bringing to this.

08:09.360 --> 08:13.360
I mean, I'm literally the first public customer of System 76.

08:13.360 --> 08:17.360
I've probably bought six laptops from them somewhere in that ballpark over the years.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.360
It's been a little while.

08:19.360 --> 08:22.360
I've owned two Dell XPS as well.

08:22.360 --> 08:30.360
In fact, I owned the Dell Tower desktop that was launched before they even did the Sputnik line.

08:30.360 --> 08:31.360
I still own it.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.360
It's out in the living room, actually.

08:33.360 --> 08:37.360
I currently have a ThinkPad X1 and I bought that when it shipped with Fedora.

08:37.360 --> 08:44.360
So I'm bringing a lot of history of machines that I have personally paid for that were Linux first computers to this review.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.360
Safe to say you've been around the Linux laptop scene.

08:46.360 --> 08:54.360
And on top of that, like this unit, we've probably had literally over a dozen review units sent into the various shows over the years.

08:54.360 --> 09:00.360
So every new laptop that comes out that runs Linux, I generally have an opportunity to get my hands on.

09:00.360 --> 09:03.360
And I sometimes pass, sometimes I don't.

09:03.360 --> 09:07.360
So that's the background in which I am bringing to this review for this laptop.

09:07.360 --> 09:15.360
That's why when I say right up front, none of them are as good as the HP Dev 1.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.360
I hope you'll take me seriously.

09:17.360 --> 09:21.360
And I hope you will give me the time in this episode to justify that statement.

09:21.360 --> 09:26.360
So let's start with the funny thing that caught my attention about the Dev 1 and why I was interested in reviewing it.

09:26.360 --> 09:29.360
And I think that is the fact that this thing ships with Pop OS.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.360
Out of the box, it ships with Pop OS.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.360
How the hell did that happen, right?

09:34.360 --> 09:35.360
It's a little surprising.

09:35.360 --> 09:41.360
I mean, you know, Fedora is a new entry, but we're kind of used to seeing Linux laptops shipping with just Ubuntu.

09:41.360 --> 09:47.360
Yeah, a lot of the laptops out there traditionally that are focused at developers, quote unquote, are just shipping with vanilla Ubuntu.

09:47.360 --> 09:53.360
And when we interviewed the team behind Sputnik, remember, we were down at Dell.

09:53.360 --> 09:58.360
We literally got a tour of Dell and met everyone on the team that was available.

09:58.360 --> 10:05.360
They said that in their research, developers wanted vanilla Ubuntu and not like something like they had shipped on the desktop tower I had bought.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.360
That was a few years ago, though.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.360
And I think maybe things have changed a little bit.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.360
So I asked, how did this happen?

10:11.360 --> 10:14.360
How did HP and System 76 get together?

10:14.360 --> 10:22.360
So it seems like HP had done a bit of analysis of this market and looked at this as being a viable segment.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.360
You mean sort of like a developer focused laptop running Linux?

10:25.360 --> 10:28.360
Yeah. Yeah. Something for the enthusiast crowd.

10:28.360 --> 10:35.360
It's kind of a hyper focused machine that tries to balance sort of sort of things like performance and portability and price.

10:35.360 --> 10:41.360
And can kind of compete in the XPS MacBook range of machines, which is not an easy thing to do.

10:41.360 --> 10:44.360
And so HP did some surveys. They did some research.

10:44.360 --> 10:49.360
And that research led them to Pop OS.

10:49.360 --> 10:56.360
And they discovered Pop OS and by discovering Pop OS, discovered System 76.

10:56.360 --> 11:03.360
And then the dev one team reached out to Carl, CEO of System 76, and he ignored their email.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.360
And then they reached out again and he ignored their email.

11:05.360 --> 11:09.360
And then they reached out again and he answered their email, was very skeptical.

11:09.360 --> 11:14.360
And I mean, this may be this may not be exactly accurate, but this is the characterization I got.

11:14.360 --> 11:17.360
It's really seemed like HP realized they needed a topic expert.

11:17.360 --> 11:22.360
Like they had the hardware figured out, but they didn't have the customer figured out and they needed a topic expert.

11:22.360 --> 11:28.360
And so after that, back and forth with Carl, Carl said that he realized they were eye to eye on a lot of goals.

11:28.360 --> 11:33.360
Quote, HP is doing the right thing with this laptop, he said to me.

11:33.360 --> 11:37.360
And since that kind of started, they've seemed like they've actually become pretty good partners.

11:37.360 --> 11:40.360
It was really co-led that presentation was co-led by both of them.

11:40.360 --> 11:46.360
And it seemed like there were opportunities where System 76 kind of stepped up and did a little extra because they could.

11:46.360 --> 11:49.360
Like they this this laptop ships with an optional mouse.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.360
It's a pretty good mouse, actually.

11:51.360 --> 11:55.360
And System 76 created a GUI configurator for that mouse.

11:55.360 --> 12:03.360
Oh, that's a nice touch. Yeah. So they kind of they kind of also had an opportunity because HP has relationships that go deeper than System 76's.

12:03.360 --> 12:11.360
And so HP was able to put an AMD engineer in the room with System 76 and HP.

12:11.360 --> 12:17.360
And then they started doing things like working with AMD to optimize the battery life via some firmware tuning.

12:17.360 --> 12:22.360
They collaborated with AMD to get suspend and resume working properly with the Zen 3 architecture.

12:22.360 --> 12:28.360
And all of that's already been upstreamed. That's already upstream. And I asked to see that.

12:28.360 --> 12:33.360
Yeah, you do. Right. So I asked, you know, what what is in it for System 76?

12:33.360 --> 12:35.360
This is, you know, aren't they competing?

12:35.360 --> 12:40.360
Carl just said really bluntly, this was an opportunity for them to get Pabos on a tier one vendor hardware.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.360
Right. Somebody that builds their own machine directly.

12:43.360 --> 12:46.360
It's not necessarily like a Clevo that's been rebuilt and refirmware.

12:46.360 --> 12:54.360
And also it means that HP has dedicated QA staff now doing QA on Pabos releases.

12:54.360 --> 12:58.360
Isn't that interesting? And that benefits System 76. Yeah.

12:58.360 --> 13:02.360
And Carl noted that it's sort of a rising tides lifts all boats sort of thing.

13:02.360 --> 13:09.360
They didn't create Pabos just for System 76. So, you know, if they're going to use it, why not work together on it?

13:09.360 --> 13:19.360
Yeah, isn't that an interesting component? Just kind of thinking about when Pabos launched, right? Sure, we tried it on other things, but it kind of shipped first on the System 76 hardware.

13:19.360 --> 13:24.360
That's where you saw it the most, at least when it before it kind of, you know, became more of a hit outside of that niche use case.

13:24.360 --> 13:26.360
And here's the next stage of that journey.

13:26.360 --> 13:32.360
Definitely. And, you know, when it came out again with Pabos, I was pretty critical. I didn't think it was a good idea.

13:32.360 --> 13:38.360
I criticized System 76 on several of our shows, but I think retrospectively you can see it was pretty necessary.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.360
Because HP laid out reasons.

13:41.360 --> 13:47.360
And one of the things they like about Pabos is that the only thing Pabos does is a desktop.

13:47.360 --> 13:55.360
I guess to them when they're shipping a desktop, they don't like the idea that the vendor might actually be a little more focused on the server side.

13:55.360 --> 13:59.360
They want the vendor to be 100 percent focused on the desktop side.

13:59.360 --> 14:04.360
Here's another thing. I actually I have the still from the presentation.

14:04.360 --> 14:11.360
And on this slide where there was HP was talking about why they wanted Pabos.

14:11.360 --> 14:20.360
They list the pop shop, but below the pop shop, one of the things they liked about Pabos is that it has flat pack support out of the box and regular Ubuntu doesn't.

14:20.360 --> 14:24.360
And that actually played a bit of a factor in their decision making.

14:24.360 --> 14:30.360
They also really like the auto tiling. They think that's anything that was the first thing that HP touched on was the auto tiling.

14:30.360 --> 14:33.360
Oh, that's cool. Yeah. So there's that element of it as well.

14:33.360 --> 14:38.360
So there was certain aspects of pop us that drew them in there, but so sort of just came together.

14:38.360 --> 14:42.360
But let's talk about the hardware. Let's talk about this laptop and why I think it's probably the best yet.

14:42.360 --> 14:49.360
And what I mean by that is not only currently, it's the best yet, but I mean it's the best execution of this idea that I've ever seen yet, too.

14:49.360 --> 14:57.360
So it is both best, the best current laptop you could buy that runs Linux and in my opinion, and it is also the best execution of the idea.

14:57.360 --> 15:04.360
It has a 14 inch 1080p display, LED backlit at 1000 nits. It's extremely bright. On average, I probably run it at 35 percent.

15:04.360 --> 15:08.360
Wes can like blast himself. He's got it right now. Very bright. Yeah.

15:08.360 --> 15:12.360
It's you can turn it up that you can actually use it outside. It can get so bright.

15:12.360 --> 15:16.360
So it's a very solid, just great screen, which gives you a really nice impression out of the box.

15:16.360 --> 15:21.360
The overall design and this is why I say it's not great at first impressions.

15:21.360 --> 15:26.360
I think HP had a certain appetite for risk. They're a big company. It makes sense, right?

15:26.360 --> 15:34.360
And their appetite for risk was in creating a relationship with System 76, kind of creating this product category and trying to sell to this new customer base.

15:34.360 --> 15:38.360
Right. That was their risk appetite, which is that's that's a lot of new things.

15:38.360 --> 15:43.360
And where they kind of played it safe, in my personal opinion, is the design of the hardware.

15:43.360 --> 15:50.360
It doesn't blow you away. It's fine. It's above average. It's a magnesium alloy that feels really good in the hands.

15:50.360 --> 15:54.360
It's it's definitely a better build. It's a tier one build.

15:54.360 --> 15:59.360
But it doesn't blow you away. Right. Yeah. It's not going to stand out in the crowd necessarily.

15:59.360 --> 16:03.360
I mean, it's a nice looking laptop, but it's a nice looking laptop. Yeah.

16:03.360 --> 16:07.360
It's an above average design, but it's not a risky design. It's not like the XPS.

16:07.360 --> 16:11.360
And I think to its detriment, the XPS has gone really bold with its new look.

16:11.360 --> 16:17.360
They just released a new XPS. It doesn't run Linux yet, but it's got two ports and they're one on each side.

16:17.360 --> 16:21.360
Right. It's got it's got that kind of butterfly style keyboard.

16:21.360 --> 16:25.360
It's a beautiful machine, but it's not fully practical and functional.

16:25.360 --> 16:30.360
Right. You're the one you keep in your bag when you travel, maybe, but not the one you can take to every job site or really get a whole bunch of work done.

16:30.360 --> 16:35.360
Or one that like feels particularly high end and nice, which is sometimes it's just nice to have something that feels good in your hands.

16:35.360 --> 16:38.360
And the ThinkPad is on the other end of that spectrum. It's very utility.

16:38.360 --> 16:43.360
It's a very it's a workhorse, but it's sort of at the it's at the other end of the design spectrum.

16:43.360 --> 16:48.360
And this kind of fits in the middle between the XPS and the ThinkPad design language.

16:48.360 --> 16:53.360
And I think it kind of strikes the balance pretty well. It's got two USB-A ports, got two USB-C ports.

16:53.360 --> 17:00.360
It's got HDMI out. It's got a barrel powered connector and it also can be charged over a USB-C and has a headphone jack, of course.

17:00.360 --> 17:06.360
And it has a nice large trackpad. Again, an above average glass trackpad on this thing.

17:06.360 --> 17:17.360
Where I didn't really start to kind of become impressed by it until I really started throwing things at it when I decided, all right, well, this is going to be my work machine for the rest of the week and the weekend and the next few days.

17:17.360 --> 17:24.360
And so like I do, I go over to Flat Hub, I get a list of about 20 applications.

17:24.360 --> 17:30.360
I throw them all at once, you know, at the system. I do the Flat Hub install and I just paste like all of the apps on there at once.

17:30.360 --> 17:37.360
Just go, go, go. Then I get like about 100 things queued up and apped and I fire that off and I have app get installing things at the same time.

17:37.360 --> 17:42.360
And then I switch over to another workspace and I queue up about 15 Steam games and I get them going.

17:42.360 --> 17:49.360
Then once one Steam game gets loaded, I launched the first one and I get the Vulkan shaders rendering and I get all of that going while I also have Slack and Element going.

17:49.360 --> 17:52.360
And this is how I use a computer. I was going to say, yeah, this is not a special stress test.

17:52.360 --> 17:58.360
This is just, this is how I use a computer. This is the this is the table stakes that a computer has to do.

17:58.360 --> 18:04.360
And I'm throwing all of this at it and I realize about 20, 30 minutes into it.

18:04.360 --> 18:10.360
I'm not hearing the fans. In fact, this thing is taking everything I throw at it.

18:10.360 --> 18:14.360
I'm not even feeling it sweat. This thing's taken and I think, all right, that's interesting.

18:14.360 --> 18:19.360
That's that's that's a good sign. And then I start using it and I'm just really happy the way it all came together.

18:19.360 --> 18:26.360
You know, I think there's a lot of value in what Pop OS has done with some of their key bindings and the auto tiling stuff.

18:26.360 --> 18:31.360
I had to really wrap my head around it and I found a cheat sheet on Reddit and I printed it out and I put it on my desk.

18:31.360 --> 18:39.360
So I had the new key bindings map. Once you start to learn that, you can move around really quick and it works really well in that in that resolution.

18:39.360 --> 18:49.360
But the performance was really impressive. And so when I fired up my first game, that was sort of like taking things to the next level and really trying to really test it.

18:49.360 --> 18:58.360
Get an idea and get a sense of where this thing is at and really get an idea of how it performs under load and figure out if I needed to replace Pop OS.

18:58.360 --> 19:03.360
So that's where I really kind of started to take things next.

19:03.360 --> 19:11.360
lino.com slash unplugged. Go there to get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the show.

19:11.360 --> 19:16.360
So it's lino.com slash unplugged. That's it. It's simple as that to get that one hundred dollars.

19:16.360 --> 19:22.360
MVME storage, super fast CPUs, 11 data centers around the world, best support in the biz.

19:22.360 --> 19:27.360
I mean, I could go on and on. In fact, I often do. And you know what?

19:27.360 --> 19:33.360
Still to this day, two and a half years later, when I need to deploy something, I go to Linode.

19:33.360 --> 19:37.360
I go to Linode because I've had a great experience. Honestly, the performance, it matters to me.

19:37.360 --> 19:43.360
But they're also just great citizens in the Linux community. That's actually how I found Linode originally.

19:43.360 --> 19:47.360
I was at Texas Linux Fest, which feels like a hundred years ago.

19:47.360 --> 19:53.360
Texas Linux Fest was having a bit of a rough year and most of the vendors just weren't even really trying.

19:53.360 --> 19:57.360
But Linode was there with a smile on their face in the best booth,

19:57.360 --> 20:02.360
making what turned out to be one of the most influential Linux Fest in my lifetime possible.

20:02.360 --> 20:06.360
And I made a mental note. I wasn't even looking for sponsors back then.

20:06.360 --> 20:11.360
But I made a mental note that when it came time, I was going to look up Linode.

20:11.360 --> 20:16.360
And while I waited, I tried them out as a customer. I became a customer first.

20:16.360 --> 20:19.360
And I was so damn impressed. You know, they've been doing this for nearly 19 years.

20:19.360 --> 20:23.360
So it makes sense they get it right. But that doesn't mean every company does that.

20:23.360 --> 20:27.360
There's a lot of places you can host things, but no place quite does it like Linode with the performance,

20:27.360 --> 20:31.360
the support and just the continuous improvement.

20:31.360 --> 20:36.360
They just expanded their managed database offering, which was just MySQL back in May.

20:36.360 --> 20:42.360
Well, now they're offering Postgres and MongoDB, which is huge for us.

20:42.360 --> 20:47.360
I'm probably going to move our matrix Postgres database over to this. I mean, why not?

20:47.360 --> 20:53.360
Why not take advantage of the expertise that is Linode staff and their infrastructure to run the database?

20:53.360 --> 20:59.360
The part of running a matrix or I kind of don't like anyways. I think it's pretty great.

20:59.360 --> 21:03.360
And I'd do it to fight if I was using MongoDB or MySQL. I'm ready to jump in, though.

21:03.360 --> 21:06.360
I tell you what. They've also released a new e-book which you can get for free,

21:06.360 --> 21:10.360
which helps give you a high level understanding of database and database architectures

21:10.360 --> 21:16.360
and different deployment methods and what methods might work, you know, best in the cloud possibly.

21:16.360 --> 21:20.360
Or when you're working with their crazy fast storage or their AMD epic processors.

21:20.360 --> 21:26.360
AMD really has some great CPUs. And you know what? Linode was down. They were down.

21:26.360 --> 21:30.360
They put them in some of their high ends. We've got a system with AMD epic processors in it.

21:30.360 --> 21:34.360
I just I love it. I love the flexibility. I love the distribution choice.

21:34.360 --> 21:38.360
I love the support and all of it. Plus, it's a great way for you to try something,

21:38.360 --> 21:41.360
for you to learn something, to get that one hundred dollars and support the show.

21:41.360 --> 21:47.360
Just head right over to Linode.com slash unplugged. Get that one hundred dollars for 60 days on a new account.

21:47.360 --> 21:52.360
Kick the tires for yourself and support the show. Linode.com slash unplugged.

21:55.360 --> 21:58.360
All right. Well, I should probably be paying attention to the show right now,

21:58.360 --> 22:05.360
but I noticed you hadn't installed Race the Sun on here yet. I've got that fixed and it's working just great.

22:05.360 --> 22:08.360
I have not I've not heard the fans yet, though. And that was kind of the point of this.

22:08.360 --> 22:11.360
Yeah, it really is nice. It is nice to have performance and have it be quiet.

22:11.360 --> 22:16.360
So let's talk about the hardware and then talk about gaming in there because that is what gets the fans going.

22:16.360 --> 22:23.360
So this has a Ryzen 7 Pro 5850U processor that's based on the AMD Zen 3 micro architecture.

22:23.360 --> 22:29.360
It's got eight CPU cores and 16 threads total with a boost at four point four gigahertz max

22:29.360 --> 22:35.360
with a one point nine gigahertz base clock and an L3 cache that clocks in at 16 megabytes.

22:35.360 --> 22:43.360
The APU, that's the integrated graphics processor, is based on the Radeon RX Vega 8 graphics processor.

22:43.360 --> 22:49.360
So that is to say decent graphics performance, but it's not going to compete with a dedicated gaming laptop.

22:49.360 --> 22:54.360
And it's definitely not going to compete with a PC with a high end graphics card.

22:54.360 --> 23:00.360
But if you're a casual gamer and you're interested in a work laptop that can play games,

23:00.360 --> 23:06.360
modern Steam games when they come out, it will do that. I've played No Man's Sky on there.

23:06.360 --> 23:11.360
I've played Elder Ring on there, although there was some bugs with that that are not the hardware's fault.

23:11.360 --> 23:16.360
I played a whole slew of different games on their CSGO. They're all very, very playable.

23:16.360 --> 23:21.360
You might have to tweak some of the settings, but at the end of the day, you're working with a 14 inch screen.

23:21.360 --> 23:28.360
So even if your favorite game maybe has to get cranked down a little bit, the 14 inch screen is not that big of a deal.

23:28.360 --> 23:32.360
You probably expected a little compromise and a very portable little laptop, right?

23:32.360 --> 23:37.360
This really gets to the point of where they strike the balance. And just a note on that.

23:37.360 --> 23:42.360
You know, the reality is with my ThinkPad, I've never been really quite happy because it's all Intel.

23:42.360 --> 23:50.360
And that has been super nice for compatibility. But it has meant that I spent, you know, two grand on a laptop that I can't play games on.

23:50.360 --> 23:55.360
And Linux has gotten to be an awesome game platform. And if I only get three or four chances a year to play games,

23:55.360 --> 23:58.360
I'd like my computer to be able to do it when I do want to do that.

23:58.360 --> 24:02.360
But I'm not going to have a setup or a special gaming rig that, oh, you didn't bring with you to Montana.

24:02.360 --> 24:07.360
And yeah, right. And maybe I don't even game enough to justify buying a video card, really.

24:07.360 --> 24:16.360
So there's that. And the other way to go would be to get a bigger laptop with an integrated graphics card that is heavier,

24:16.360 --> 24:20.360
that uses more power, that produces more heat, that has more fan noise.

24:20.360 --> 24:24.360
And I have to screw with like the Nvidia driver problems or something like that.

24:24.360 --> 24:29.360
And with this AMD Ryzen platform, again, this strikes the balance.

24:29.360 --> 24:33.360
It's got a graphics processor in there you can actually play a current game on.

24:33.360 --> 24:43.360
But it also has a very fast desktop class, almost not quite processor, that does your regular computational stuff really well without killing the battery.

24:43.360 --> 24:50.360
Again, it's a it's a hard balance. And then when you factor in the price that it's basically eleven hundred dollars, ten ninety nine,

24:50.360 --> 24:55.360
and they've managed to kind of strike that area, I think it starts to become more compelling.

24:55.360 --> 24:59.360
There's a few other factors in here, too, that I think are really nice from a hardware standpoint.

24:59.360 --> 25:02.360
It's got 16 gigs of RAM from the factory, but it's user serviceable.

25:02.360 --> 25:05.360
And you can put up to 64 gigabytes of RAM in there. Oh, excellent.

25:05.360 --> 25:11.360
Hard drive is also user serviceable chips right now with a one terabyte m dot two PCI three.

25:11.360 --> 25:17.360
But you could put your own drive in there. These days, that feels kind of refreshing that you can do upgrades.

25:17.360 --> 25:23.360
It seems like everybody's dropping that concept when it was in the prototype stages and it wasn't a product yet.

25:23.360 --> 25:31.360
The very first version that system 76 got came as parts in a box and system 76 assembled it from parts.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.360
They are experts at that. They are right.

25:33.360 --> 25:38.360
I mean, but the reason they mentioned that story was to kind of underscore the serviceability here.

25:38.360 --> 25:42.360
The upstream HP laptop that ships Windows that this has been forked from.

25:42.360 --> 25:47.360
That has a 10 out of 10 repairability score from my fix it. Wow.

25:47.360 --> 25:50.360
So the serviceability is pretty good against really striking that balance, right?

25:50.360 --> 25:53.360
Right. But it's still it's not it's not big and bloated.

25:53.360 --> 25:58.360
Have you been tempted to, like, get a screwdriver at it? Have you done that yet?

25:58.360 --> 26:00.360
I want to. Yeah. Yeah, I want to. I think I will.

26:00.360 --> 26:03.360
Are you allowed to on the on the on a unit review unit?

26:03.360 --> 26:10.360
And that's another question, perhaps. You know, sometimes when it comes to these reviews, Brett, you you you don't really ask so much.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.360
Maybe you apologize after the fact.

26:13.360 --> 26:16.360
There's only like a one in one in four chance he breaks it.

26:16.360 --> 26:20.360
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We won't mention it publicly or anything, right?

26:20.360 --> 26:24.360
I mean, hey, you said it was serviceable. You said it's got a decent keyboard.

26:24.360 --> 26:29.360
I think probably the more notable thing about it is that it has that chick lit look without that butterfly feel.

26:29.360 --> 26:33.360
It's got a pretty it's not super clicky, but it's not too soft.

26:33.360 --> 26:35.360
It's sort of just an average, but pretty good keyboard.

26:35.360 --> 26:40.360
I'd say the keys are easy to find wide enough to, you know, decent travel.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.360
Yeah, not bad. It is backlit LED backlit.

26:42.360 --> 26:45.360
That's nice. That really, you know, I think I think I'm done.

26:45.360 --> 26:49.360
I could handle it for a while, but I think I'm done with non backlit keyboards.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.360
Oh, yeah. Also, it has the track point in the middle. I knew I was forgetting something.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.360
Also a nice touch. Yeah, that is a nice touch.

26:54.360 --> 26:58.360
It is actually you have both. I would take those on just every laptop I had if I could.

26:58.360 --> 27:01.360
Yeah. Yeah. It's not just a thing bad thing anymore.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.360
So that's that's a great thing about it.

27:03.360 --> 27:11.360
The other thing I couldn't really get like super solid details on this, but it has what they call a spill resistant keyboard.

27:11.360 --> 27:14.360
So in theory, you could spill an amount of water.

27:14.360 --> 27:17.360
I think your chances go down if it's a sugary beverage or alcohol.

27:17.360 --> 27:22.360
But if it's like water, maybe coffee, something like that, a little rain gets in your bag.

27:22.360 --> 27:26.360
Yeah, it has what they call a spill resistant keyboard.

27:26.360 --> 27:29.360
That's pretty nice. And I already said the track that's fine. It's a glass keyboard.

27:29.360 --> 27:34.360
It's a trackpad. It's it's probably the best trackpad that ships on a Linux machine.

27:34.360 --> 27:38.360
But the part that surprised me the most on this laptop, can you guess?

27:38.360 --> 27:41.360
You might you might be able to guess because I already mentioned it to you.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.360
Full size HDMI. That is sort of surprising this day and age.

27:44.360 --> 27:49.360
But no, the speakers. Oh, they're much better than I anticipated.

27:49.360 --> 27:55.360
When I see a thin laptop with thin, thin, thin speaker grills in the PC world, I have very low expectations.

27:55.360 --> 28:03.360
I assume you want to reuse them and move on. I do. I do. In fact, I had to check myself because I'd realized it wasn't until I started a game.

28:03.360 --> 28:06.360
I realized I hadn't even tested the speakers because I just saw the small little speaker grills.

28:06.360 --> 28:09.360
I was like, all right, fine.

28:09.360 --> 28:14.360
But then the game started and I actually had that reaction was like I looked around the room like that.

28:14.360 --> 28:18.360
Is that this laptop? Is that coming from this laptop?

28:18.360 --> 28:24.360
I mean, they're pretty good. They're not like they're not like going to like, you know, blow your ears off.

28:24.360 --> 28:27.360
They did a range test and like they don't really go below 100 hertz.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.360
So you're not going to get like real lows or anything.

28:29.360 --> 28:33.360
But I'd say they're as good as the MacBooks right before the M1.

28:33.360 --> 28:39.360
So pretty good competitive in the industry, especially on a laptop that size, which is better than, you know, PC laptops usually get.

28:39.360 --> 28:43.360
Yeah. And it's got a 720p webcam that does the job. I haven't tried that part yet.

28:43.360 --> 28:50.360
Yeah, I tried it. The battery in there is, I thought, going to be the weakest thing about it, because to be honest with you guys, spec wise.

28:50.360 --> 28:55.360
Fifty three watt hours. And I thought, OK, well, how good is this going to be?

28:55.360 --> 28:59.360
But the firmware tuning they did with AMD has paid off.

28:59.360 --> 29:02.360
You get a range depending on what you're doing in my testing.

29:02.360 --> 29:11.360
I got somewhere between five ish, six hours and three hours, depending on what I was doing, like playing games or benchmarking.

29:11.360 --> 29:16.360
When I was really taking the GPU and CPU, I got about three hours.

29:16.360 --> 29:22.360
They say twelve hours, depending on what you do for, like, you know, remote terminal work and working in a text editor and stuff like that.

29:22.360 --> 29:28.360
They say twelve hours and they do this thing called HP fast charging with this laptop.

29:28.360 --> 29:33.360
You get 50 percent charge in 30 minutes. And I took a look at how this works in good own power statistics.

29:33.360 --> 29:43.360
And what they do is for the first 50 percent of the battery or just a little bit over, they pump about 44 or 45 watts into the battery and get it up to that 50 percent.

29:43.360 --> 29:51.360
And then it kind of clocks down to about twenty three point seven watts for the remaining charge, which is about another half hour or so.

29:51.360 --> 29:55.360
And the rate of what it can put into the battery will also depend on what you're doing on the laptop.

29:55.360 --> 29:58.360
So that varies as well. But you can look at this in real time, you know, statistics.

29:58.360 --> 30:07.360
In fact, a whole suite of hardware sensors. I don't know if you look, but there's a I have a genome extension there that has like the temperatures or the CPU cores and stuff.

30:07.360 --> 30:13.360
Yeah. If you go in there, you can seven volts right now. You can see the voltage and the wattage of the CPU, the GPU.

30:13.360 --> 30:17.360
You can see the fan R.P.M. zero R.P.M. over here. Yeah. Yeah. Zero R.P.M. at the moment.

30:17.360 --> 30:23.360
It's pretty quiet. All the different sensors. I mean, this thing has a full suite of sensors that are supported by Linux out of the box.

30:23.360 --> 30:29.360
And so you get a lot of data sensor one and two. Yeah. You get good data to work with as a tester and a reviewer.

30:29.360 --> 30:38.360
I really appreciated that. And one thing I definitely noticed is the GNOME battery life algorithm is struggling to figure out the battery life on this laptop.

30:38.360 --> 30:42.360
So you couldn't go by the hour estimate. You had to you had to actually clock it.

30:42.360 --> 30:45.360
I don't know if that's going to get better with usage. It might. It has another laptops.

30:45.360 --> 30:52.360
But, you know, I'd peg it at six hours if you're doing your regular work in a tech center, in a web browser, in a terminal and chat.

30:52.360 --> 30:58.360
And I'd probably peg it at three hours if you're playing video games on battery, which you probably don't want to do.

30:58.360 --> 31:04.360
Another nice thing about it is it does have that barrel charger, but it does also charge over the USBC ports.

31:04.360 --> 31:11.360
And surprised by this. Charges slightly faster over USBC when you charge.

31:11.360 --> 31:15.360
Yeah, when you charge with USBC, you get around 50 watts of charging instead of 44.

31:15.360 --> 31:19.360
So, you know, I didn't expect that, but that's pretty great.

31:19.360 --> 31:23.360
So I was I was really happy about that and I was happy I had the option to do both.

31:23.360 --> 31:29.360
Yeah, that is kind of nice. I mean, I don't know that I would ever like want the barrel added, but once it's already baked in, like, why not?

31:29.360 --> 31:33.360
Right. Maybe that's the one you leave at your desk that you talk to because you use USBC for other things.

31:33.360 --> 31:39.360
You know, yeah, I can see that. And the USBC ports, they are USBC three, whatever, super speed.

31:39.360 --> 31:44.360
And it has display port and it does power delivery. Of course, they are not Thunderbolt.

31:44.360 --> 31:47.360
That's just not really a thing on the AMD laptop platforms.

31:47.360 --> 31:52.360
But future generations of AMD laptops are going to have USB four.

31:52.360 --> 31:57.360
Yeah, shiny new USB four. And that's basically Thunderbolt. So it is coming soon.

31:57.360 --> 32:01.360
You know, I think it was like a year ago, maybe eight months.

32:01.360 --> 32:08.360
We were getting quite excited about the Lemur Pro. And I wondered how you thought this compared to that.

32:08.360 --> 32:15.360
And I think the follow up question would be what is system 76 thinking about the comparison between those two?

32:15.360 --> 32:19.360
Do they use what they learned on the Lemur to apply to this?

32:19.360 --> 32:25.360
If I'm going out to buy one, which one should I choose? I know that Lemur Pro is not quite available right now because they're coming out with a new version.

32:25.360 --> 32:29.360
And I just I wonder how that's going to compare. That's a huge question I have.

32:29.360 --> 32:35.360
Well, I think your question actually gets at the root of why I think this might be the Linux laptop.

32:35.360 --> 32:40.360
Now, there's always going to be edge cases for different use cases and jobs and price points.

32:40.360 --> 32:42.360
You've got to fit your situation and all that.

32:42.360 --> 32:51.360
But when you're talking about a laptop that's eleven hundred dollars that you can safely recommend to anyone that wants to be a Linux user that wants a Linux first machine, I think this laptop fits the bill.

32:51.360 --> 32:59.360
And also one of the things that I know this sounds silly, guys, but think about it from like audience members email in and they want to know where to go to get a Linux computer.

32:59.360 --> 33:02.360
HP dev one dot com. It's just simple, right?

33:02.360 --> 33:07.360
You don't go to like Dell and search for the Linux machine and go through that really crazy ass complicated configurator.

33:07.360 --> 33:11.360
Would you say it was called Sputnik? Yeah. And with this, it's like there's one option and you buy it.

33:11.360 --> 33:15.360
It's like you click it, check out done. Right. It's a very simple process.

33:15.360 --> 33:21.360
And then to get to your core question about how it compares to something like the Lamer and this is my honest opinion.

33:21.360 --> 33:27.360
HP is a tier one hardware vendor and their build is better than what Clevo does.

33:27.360 --> 33:34.360
And the Lamer, while it's a good machine with good performance, it's not necessarily manufactured by a tier one hardware manufacturer.

33:34.360 --> 33:37.360
And there is a difference in the build quality.

33:37.360 --> 33:42.360
And this has a really great arrangement of performance and price.

33:42.360 --> 33:49.360
You know, not everybody wants a 14 inch screen. Not everybody wants an AMD system, although I think the experience is just fantastic.

33:49.360 --> 33:55.360
And the fact that everything is supported out of the box by the kernel means that it is a trouble free experience.

33:55.360 --> 33:58.360
It doesn't and it's not necessarily just a pop OS thing, I think.

33:58.360 --> 34:03.360
So because of that, I feel like it's a notch above the Lamer.

34:03.360 --> 34:12.360
I think it's even better option than the XPS because the XPS is the Intel architecture with the Intel graphics and sort of the limitations of what Intel can do right now.

34:12.360 --> 34:16.360
Now, they are doing the 12th gen and the latest XPS, but that's not available with Linux yet.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.360
I don't know how that would stack up.

34:18.360 --> 34:27.360
But I know that the AMD stack in a laptop is what I've been waiting for the Zen 3 architecture with its APU.

34:27.360 --> 34:33.360
I feel like I've been waiting for it for years and it's all in one tight tier one package.

34:33.360 --> 34:36.360
That's the difference. So it's a good question. I don't know how System76 feels about it.

34:36.360 --> 34:45.360
I mean, I hope that they're making a little bit off every sale or something and I hope they can use this as ideas to build their own hardware one day.

34:45.360 --> 34:46.360
I'd love to see that.

34:46.360 --> 34:50.360
Yeah, they they tease that a little bit when we were there and that would be fantastic.

34:50.360 --> 34:56.360
But I'm sure it sounds like the connections that they made at AMD would be really good long term connections.

34:56.360 --> 35:01.360
And I'm sure everyone on every team learned a little bit about this whole process.

35:01.360 --> 35:05.360
What do you think the Dev2 should have that this one doesn't have?

35:05.360 --> 35:10.360
You know, are there any features that you're like, oh, I would really love this.

35:10.360 --> 35:12.360
You know, maybe core boot is one of those things.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.360
That would be nice.

35:14.360 --> 35:18.360
Core boot would be probably number one. That's the biggest one that was sent in by the audience, too.

35:18.360 --> 35:23.360
I did ask. The answer I got about core boot is not in this version.

35:23.360 --> 35:29.360
It was initially on the to do list, but it's a big job and they just didn't have another year to work on it.

35:29.360 --> 35:33.360
However, it's probably better to have a good experience, as you mentioned before, right?

35:33.360 --> 35:35.360
You're doing a certain number of new things.

35:35.360 --> 35:40.360
And if that was going to make like battery life work or like maybe suspend was worse or something, that's not worth it right now.

35:40.360 --> 35:43.360
However, they would not commit to this.

35:43.360 --> 35:46.360
They would even come out and directly say this.

35:46.360 --> 35:49.360
But you do this long enough, you get a sense of these things.

35:49.360 --> 35:59.360
The idea is that if this is a successful product, there will be a line of dev ones, future dev one version two and core boot is on that list.

35:59.360 --> 36:03.360
You know, I'll tell you, in using this, I like a lot more about it than I don't like.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.360
But there are a few things I don't like.

36:05.360 --> 36:12.360
The things I don't like is I have had twice now some kind of unsettling Wi-Fi issue.

36:12.360 --> 36:14.360
The real tech Wi-Fi card in there.

36:14.360 --> 36:24.360
And at one point when I was just installing software like a madman and I was installing Steam's games and stuff, the Wi-Fi just kind of dropped out.

36:24.360 --> 36:28.360
And I brought up the message and I saw some messages in there about power saving.

36:28.360 --> 36:33.360
So I went into the menu, turned off the Wi-Fi, turned it back on.

36:33.360 --> 36:35.360
It fixed it. Problem solved.

36:35.360 --> 36:39.360
Then this morning when I arrived at the studio, I brought it out of sleep.

36:39.360 --> 36:42.360
But I've been in sleep since about yesterday at dinner time.

36:42.360 --> 36:45.360
It just didn't seem to find the Wi-Fi.

36:45.360 --> 36:48.360
I brought up the Wi-Fi networks and it just sat there spinning.

36:48.360 --> 36:52.360
It's been on the Wi-Fi before, so I shouldn't have to connect and I never found any open networks.

36:52.360 --> 36:54.360
So again, I brought up the message.

36:54.360 --> 37:01.360
And I got a Mac power on failed and failed to power on Mac, failed to pull messages, just kind of looping.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.360
Reboot, fixed it.

37:03.360 --> 37:05.360
I probably could have fixed it another way.

37:05.360 --> 37:06.360
I just decided to reboot.

37:06.360 --> 37:08.360
I think maybe it's power management.

37:08.360 --> 37:17.360
It might actually be something that's specific to Ubuntu because I have had other situations where Ubuntu-based laptops are very aggressive on the Wi-Fi power saving.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.360
And maybe where Fedora doesn't do it that way by default.

37:19.360 --> 37:20.360
And I've had that experience.

37:20.360 --> 37:21.360
So I don't really know.

37:21.360 --> 37:25.360
And I haven't had a chance to track it down because it literally happened this morning before the show.

37:25.360 --> 37:26.360
You mentioned it was serviceable.

37:26.360 --> 37:28.360
Is that one thing you could swap out?

37:28.360 --> 37:29.360
I'll have to check.

37:29.360 --> 37:30.360
That's a good question.

37:30.360 --> 37:32.360
Battery life jumps around a lot.

37:32.360 --> 37:33.360
That's my other criticism.

37:33.360 --> 37:35.360
Just the estimator in GNOME.

37:35.360 --> 37:36.360
I don't know.

37:36.360 --> 37:38.360
That could be a firmware update fixes that.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.360
It does get firmware updates over LVFS.

37:40.360 --> 37:42.360
So check that box.

37:42.360 --> 37:52.360
And that may be something that gets resolved with time or perhaps it's a GNOME update or perhaps just as it gets several charge cycles, which is really what I suspect.

37:52.360 --> 37:55.360
When it gets several charge cycles under its belt, it's only had a couple.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.360
I've been really slamming this thing.

37:57.360 --> 38:00.360
So I haven't really had like a proper charge and discharge cycle with it.

38:00.360 --> 38:04.360
When it gets a few of those, I suspect it'll probably sort itself out a little bit.

38:04.360 --> 38:06.360
So those are my criticisms.

38:06.360 --> 38:09.360
That's a pretty short list because I think both are solvable.

38:09.360 --> 38:13.360
I think they're both actually software problems, but I'm not positive.

38:13.360 --> 38:21.360
If the Dev 2 could have a bigger battery, that would make me tempted to want like a 2K screen or something maybe.

38:21.360 --> 38:26.360
I would be maybe a little hesitant with the current battery size because I get that that's one of the major tradeoffs.

38:26.360 --> 38:30.360
You know, I got a 2K screen on my ThinkPad and I won't do that again.

38:30.360 --> 38:31.360
Is that right?

38:31.360 --> 38:33.360
Yeah, it's just not the right spot for Linux.

38:33.360 --> 38:34.360
I don't know why, man.

38:34.360 --> 38:39.360
It works great on the desktop with a 27-inch screen, but on a 14-inch screen, it's murder.

38:39.360 --> 38:42.360
And you end up having to use like, I have to do it all the time.

38:42.360 --> 38:45.360
You go in there, scale up the fonts, you have to scale up everything.

38:45.360 --> 38:51.360
It works best if your desktop supports fractional scaling because 200% is way too much.

38:51.360 --> 38:53.360
It hasn't been great.

38:53.360 --> 38:56.360
I really think you either go 1080p.

38:56.360 --> 38:57.360
That's the best experience.

38:57.360 --> 39:04.360
So what you want to do is optimize for the best display at 1080p because I still think that's where Linux is at its best.

39:04.360 --> 39:05.360
Or you go 4K.

39:05.360 --> 39:11.360
But when you go 4K, there's a lot of performance tradeoffs and there's also a lot of UI tradeoffs still.

39:11.360 --> 39:19.360
Unless you're living in a totally GTK4 or GTK3 and later KDE world, there's a lot of issues.

39:19.360 --> 39:21.360
Like you open up things like Reaper or Mumble.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.360
It's true.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.360
Yeah, they may not scale nicely.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.360
Yeah.

39:24.360 --> 39:30.360
So whereas 1080p, you don't have that and you can actually scale down a little bit if you want and get a little more screen real estate.

39:30.360 --> 39:33.360
So I've kind of gotten back on the 1080p bandwagon.

39:33.360 --> 39:38.360
So I don't know if I'd actually tweak that for the version 2 unless the broader Linux landscape had gotten better.

39:38.360 --> 39:40.360
But I'd like to have the option, I think.

39:40.360 --> 39:41.360
Yeah.

39:41.360 --> 39:42.360
Could see that.

39:42.360 --> 39:43.360
A few more options.

39:43.360 --> 39:47.360
I'd like to be able to build it with more RAM just from the factory.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.360
You don't have an option right now to do that.

39:49.360 --> 39:54.360
Yeah, right, so, you know, your normies won't be able to customize it.

39:54.360 --> 39:55.360
I guess we can.

39:55.360 --> 40:07.360
And I think the biggest negative that I can think of and the biggest thing they either need to change as soon as possible or definitely with version 2 is it's US only right now.

40:07.360 --> 40:09.360
And I think that's such a shame.

40:09.360 --> 40:14.360
Yeah, because I think this is the best Linux laptop probably ever made.

40:14.360 --> 40:17.360
And it's a damn shame that it's limited to the US.

40:17.360 --> 40:21.360
And I can't believe the pricing for this thing, especially these days.

40:21.360 --> 40:23.360
You know, and the other thing.

40:23.360 --> 40:25.360
The shipping on these things is ridiculous.

40:25.360 --> 40:27.360
They're shipping them out in like two, three days.

40:27.360 --> 40:30.360
So that's the upside to not having a configuration, right?

40:30.360 --> 40:32.360
And being a tier one.

40:32.360 --> 40:34.360
They can afford to have some inventory.

40:34.360 --> 40:36.360
But, you know, when you're a business, that matters.

40:36.360 --> 40:39.360
Like if you want to get equipment for a new hire, it's nice to be able to get it within a couple of days.

40:39.360 --> 40:41.360
So I think that's fantastic.

40:41.360 --> 40:44.360
I'd love to see a fingerprint reader in there perhaps as well.

40:44.360 --> 40:49.360
And the other thing that I would probably tweak is I would probably move the power button.

40:49.360 --> 40:51.360
You see where the power button is?

40:51.360 --> 40:59.360
Yeah, it's right above the backspace and kind of next to a row where you've got your delete and home and page up and page down on the far right hand side.

40:59.360 --> 41:00.360
Uh huh.

41:00.360 --> 41:01.360
But where is it again, Wes?

41:01.360 --> 41:03.360
Between backspace and delete.

41:03.360 --> 41:04.360
Yeah.

41:04.360 --> 41:05.360
Yeah.

41:05.360 --> 41:06.360
I can see hitting that accidentally.

41:06.360 --> 41:07.360
I mean, kind of often.

41:07.360 --> 41:08.360
I haven't yet.

41:08.360 --> 41:09.360
I also have not yet.

41:09.360 --> 41:10.360
Yeah.

41:10.360 --> 41:11.360
And what happens if I do hit it?

41:11.360 --> 41:15.360
OK, not the end of the world, at least on Papa just brings up, hey, do you want to turn this off?

41:15.360 --> 41:17.360
I could see that being a little annoying, though.

41:17.360 --> 41:21.360
Yeah, I mean, just, you know, that's again, that's the laptop they forked this from.

41:21.360 --> 41:22.360
That's where it is.

41:22.360 --> 41:26.360
So speaking of that awkward question, how well does it run Windows?

41:26.360 --> 41:27.360
You know, what if you're going to do this thing?

41:27.360 --> 41:28.360
I assume fine, right?

41:28.360 --> 41:29.360
Yeah.

41:29.360 --> 41:30.360
It's forked from a Windows line.

41:30.360 --> 41:31.360
I would think so.

41:31.360 --> 41:37.360
Funny enough, I assume when I got this out of the box on office hours, it arrived live while we're doing office hours.

41:37.360 --> 41:39.360
So I unboxed it on office hour six.

41:39.360 --> 41:43.360
I think I said in that episode, I'll have like Fedora on it by Sunday.

41:43.360 --> 41:46.360
I think I said something like that, but I haven't.

41:46.360 --> 41:48.360
And I didn't even think to try Windows on there.

41:48.360 --> 41:49.360
Pop is pretty good.

41:49.360 --> 41:52.360
Where it falls down, in my opinion, is apt.

41:52.360 --> 41:56.360
Just as a quick aside, I decided to install steam from the pop shop.

41:56.360 --> 41:58.360
I don't think I'll do that again.

41:58.360 --> 41:59.360
I had a bad time.

41:59.360 --> 42:06.360
Well, or I'll change it from the flat pack because by default installed the flat pack version of steam, which I was fine with because that's worked great for me on Fedora.

42:06.360 --> 42:14.360
And then I launched steam and I get this error message that like steam hardware, steam accessories or some steam package is missing.

42:14.360 --> 42:19.360
And it tells me to apt get install or it tells me to basically install this.

42:19.360 --> 42:22.360
And I knew right then and there I was in trouble because I figured, all right, this probably exists.

42:22.360 --> 42:27.360
It's just locked up in a flat pack or something or the flat pack is sandboxed and I can't see it or whatever.

42:27.360 --> 42:30.360
But I'll go along. I'll do what I'm told to do because this is what a regular user would do.

42:30.360 --> 42:32.360
So I tells me to install this package.

42:32.360 --> 42:35.360
So I install that package on the command line like it tells me to.

42:35.360 --> 42:41.360
And of course, that package pulls in steam, the deb as a dependency.

42:41.360 --> 42:44.360
So now I've got two copies of steam on this machine.

42:44.360 --> 42:46.360
That's too much steam.

42:46.360 --> 42:47.360
They're not which one you're launching.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.360
Neither one of them is aware of each other.

42:48.360 --> 42:53.360
And yeah, you don't know which one you're launching when you just type steam into the very nice cosmic launcher.

42:53.360 --> 42:58.360
Thankfully, you know, you can remove a flat pack with a scalpel unlike a lot of times with apps.

42:58.360 --> 43:00.360
So I just removed the flat pack.

43:00.360 --> 43:02.360
But it's things like that.

43:02.360 --> 43:10.360
I described it to my co-host, Mike, that apt feels like 90s technology that we've just dragged forward because it for so long was better than anything else we had.

43:10.360 --> 43:11.360
And now it's not.

43:11.360 --> 43:18.360
And, you know, when you look at what happened to Linus Tech Tips when they were trying out Pop OS, it again was an apt issue.

43:18.360 --> 43:27.360
If I was not familiar with the Linux landscape and I was just trying to get steam running on this laptop as a reviewer, I just would have hit an issue there.

43:27.360 --> 43:30.360
And I would have had a messed up thing, you know, with my gaming setup.

43:30.360 --> 43:33.360
Just that kind of stuff. It's no one's fault in particular, really.

43:33.360 --> 43:36.360
It's just sort of the world of apt get right now.

43:36.360 --> 43:40.360
Yeah, right. And kind of where some of the curation ends in the experience.

43:40.360 --> 43:45.360
To Pop's credit, they do have pretty good Nix package support and they will even do auto Nix updates.

43:45.360 --> 43:46.360
That's right.

43:46.360 --> 43:51.360
So it's not like they're not thinking of this, but I'm just saying like right now that's where things are at.

43:51.360 --> 43:53.360
I got a question that came in.

43:53.360 --> 43:58.360
Does it run a mainline kernel or does it need closed source blobs to take full advantage of the hardware?

43:58.360 --> 44:01.360
I know some laptops require blobs for certain power management features.

44:01.360 --> 44:03.360
I'm hoping this is 100 percent mainline.

44:03.360 --> 44:15.360
It is. And I asked this question directly because HP and System 76 are doing QA on every firmware kernel and major Pop OS update that will go on the dev one.

44:15.360 --> 44:21.360
In fact, Carl said on the call that they are going to indefinitely QA Pop OS on the dev one.

44:21.360 --> 44:24.360
They have dev ones there and they're going to do indefinite QA.

44:24.360 --> 44:25.360
That's impressive.

44:25.360 --> 44:32.360
That's another reason why I think maybe it's worth sticking with Pop because when you first install it, they say and they're very clear about it.

44:32.360 --> 44:36.360
I think you'd like this, Wes. They ask you if you want to submit analytics to HP.

44:36.360 --> 44:39.360
And when if you say yes, they actually show you the JSON.

44:39.360 --> 44:40.360
Oh, that's great.

44:40.360 --> 44:42.360
They're going to send. So you can just read the JSON file.

44:42.360 --> 44:44.360
Yeah. OK, I'm OK with this or not.

44:44.360 --> 44:46.360
Yeah. And so you can choose to do it or not.

44:46.360 --> 44:50.360
It's it's not by default and you can choose to opt in.

44:50.360 --> 45:01.360
And what they said what they're going to do with that data, because I asked, is that they are planning to do continuous improvements to Pop OS and to the drivers in the firmware based on the data they collect.

45:01.360 --> 45:03.360
And they're going to try to see, like, are people upgrading the RAM?

45:03.360 --> 45:05.360
Is that something we should offer that kind of stuff?

45:05.360 --> 45:08.360
So that's what they're using that for. But you don't have to do it.

45:08.360 --> 45:12.360
And yes, everything is being mainlined and they are doing the QA before they mainline it.

45:12.360 --> 45:14.360
So that's pretty great. Is it upgradable?

45:14.360 --> 45:20.360
The website says it supports 64 gigs of RAM. How would you compare it to the XPS 13 came in from Grant?

45:20.360 --> 45:25.360
Yes, it is upgradable, Grant. And I think the XPS 13 is a better looking machine.

45:25.360 --> 45:30.360
It's a more aggressive design. I think it's trying to kind of compete more with the MacBook Air.

45:30.360 --> 45:36.360
I think this is kind of a mix of the XPS and the ThinkPad and kind of a more.

45:36.360 --> 45:41.360
Utility design, but skewing a little bit nicer because it is that magnesium alloy.

45:41.360 --> 45:45.360
It does have a real nice profile when it's closed. It does feel really solid and well built in the hand.

45:45.360 --> 45:50.360
It doesn't feel plasticky. I wasn't sure exactly what is made out of it first.

45:50.360 --> 45:53.360
Yeah, I could say it being metal or like a really nice plastic.

45:53.360 --> 45:56.360
Yeah, but it is magnesium alloy. I was told so.

45:56.360 --> 46:01.360
And then as you when you buy it, you have the option to get it with the HP 935 creator wireless mouse.

46:01.360 --> 46:06.360
That's an 80 dollar add on. It it's actually not a bad mouse.

46:06.360 --> 46:10.360
They sent it in as well. Twelve weeks of battery life. OK, here's what I liked about it.

46:10.360 --> 46:14.360
As you can see, I'm using the USB-A dongle. I just like that.

46:14.360 --> 46:19.360
But it also does Bluetooth and it comes with a USB-C charging cable and it charges over USB-C.

46:19.360 --> 46:25.360
That's nice. Yeah. Modern. Yeah. And it's got a bunch of cool buttons, including buttons that can basically do macros.

46:25.360 --> 46:30.360
Whoa. I could use this for like doing multiple things. Yeah. Changing shots, perhaps.

46:30.360 --> 46:37.360
Yeah, exactly. And they create System 76, created a graphical configurator to set all that stuff up on the mouse.

46:37.360 --> 46:42.360
They also offer the launch keyboard for 285 because HP said they just wanted to offer a keyboard.

46:42.360 --> 46:49.360
They knew it was good that worked with Linux. The developers would like I know 285 for some folks seems crazy for a keyboard.

46:49.360 --> 46:54.360
I know a guy who's got a thousand dollar keyboard, though. So, you know, to each their own, I suppose.

46:54.360 --> 46:57.360
I mean, we spend all day on it. So it seems to make sense. Yeah.

46:57.360 --> 47:02.360
Hey, man, you're talking to a guy who's literally got one right here. So, yeah, yeah.

47:02.360 --> 47:07.360
I bought that with my own money. Why don't they make them with padded keys or auto type? You just think things and it types for you.

47:07.360 --> 47:11.360
Oh, wouldn't that be cool? Then you wouldn't need a keyboard, I guess.

47:11.360 --> 47:15.360
Yeah. Although you'd probably need a neural interface. So there is that.

47:15.360 --> 47:21.360
So I think as I used it, as I continue to use it, I have begun to like it more and more and more.

47:21.360 --> 47:28.360
And it's actually been a long time since I've come on air and said, this is the laptop I recommend, but this is the laptop I recommend.

47:28.360 --> 47:33.360
You know, I started very skeptical. I've never really liked an HP laptop. I have one.

47:33.360 --> 47:37.360
Yeah, I have owned one. And I've also supported hundreds in IT.

47:37.360 --> 47:46.360
And that's where I really kind of built a disdain for them because Windows and HP hardware and corporations were always trying to buy like the cheapest laptop possible.

47:46.360 --> 47:51.360
And so I came in pretty skeptical, you know, because the design, too, didn't blow me away at first, too.

47:51.360 --> 47:56.360
Like, I wasn't immediately drawn to it. And so it's one of these situations where I kind of started on the.

47:56.360 --> 47:59.360
All right. That's going to be one of those where Chris goes on air and has a rant on HP.

47:59.360 --> 48:06.360
And I talk about the years of issues I've had with HP and then I used it and I used it and I used it and then I benchmarked it,

48:06.360 --> 48:10.360
which I will have links in the show notes to some open benchmarks if you'd like to compare it to your system.

48:10.360 --> 48:15.360
Super easy to do that. And now now it's my I think it's the best Linux laptop ever made.

48:15.360 --> 48:19.360
And it's my totally do recommend laptop. And I think the price is totally fair.

48:19.360 --> 48:24.360
I think this is easily a fifteen hundred dollar laptop going for, you know, eleven hundred bucks.

48:24.360 --> 48:27.360
Are you going to try some new distros now that you've had some time with Papawas?

48:27.360 --> 48:34.360
Yeah, I've been thinking about that. I think so mostly just because I really like Fedora and I really like Nix on laptops now.

48:34.360 --> 48:40.360
So but if you've got any questions, feel free to boost them in or send them at Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact.

48:40.360 --> 48:44.360
I'll try to get them answered.

48:44.360 --> 48:53.360
Bitwarden dot com slash Linux. Get started with a free trial of teams or enterprise plans at Bitwarden dot com slash Linux or try it for free as an individual user.

48:53.360 --> 48:59.360
Bitwarden is just the easiest way for an individual or for a business to store, share and sync sensitive data.

48:59.360 --> 49:02.360
Bitwarden is fully open source, trusted by millions of users.

49:02.360 --> 49:05.360
You know, we trust it. You guys know we use it as our password manager.

49:05.360 --> 49:12.360
You know that part of what made me choose that is Bitwarden's open source is what Weston I used to manage our passwords, our two factor codes and other sensitive data.

49:12.360 --> 49:17.360
And we're finally getting Brent on board, too. You know, we've achieved something there.

49:17.360 --> 49:19.360
And I love the support that Bitwarden offers.

49:19.360 --> 49:24.360
If you get stuck, if you have a family member or friend that you recommended a Bitwarden, they got you covered there.

49:24.360 --> 49:26.360
On top of that, they're always rolling out new features.

49:26.360 --> 49:29.360
They just added a new quick account switcher to Android.

49:29.360 --> 49:33.360
This is absolute fire, you guys. You're sitting there trying to fill out a password.

49:33.360 --> 49:35.360
Oh, crap. That's a business log in, not a personal log in.

49:35.360 --> 49:38.360
Oh, you know what? Tap an icon, switch over to the other account.

49:38.360 --> 49:40.360
Boom. Now you're filling that out.

49:40.360 --> 49:42.360
They've recently introduced a new username generator.

49:42.360 --> 49:47.360
So that way you're using a unique username and a unique password when you're signing up for a site or a service.

49:47.360 --> 49:50.360
Man, is that not super great?

49:50.360 --> 49:58.360
And they've also now begun working with certain email relay services like Firefox Relay or a non Addy or simple log in or more.

49:58.360 --> 50:00.360
You can just put in your API key.

50:00.360 --> 50:06.360
And then when you go create an account now to service, you know, like an app or a website or whatever, it'll generate the password.

50:06.360 --> 50:09.360
It'll generate the username and it'll give them a unique email address.

50:09.360 --> 50:14.360
And it makes sure you get all that stuff. You keep track all that stuff and it all still gets back to you.

50:14.360 --> 50:17.360
That right there killer feature right there.

50:17.360 --> 50:23.360
And you guys know this, but maybe someone you know, maybe a family, a friend, maybe the place you work.

50:23.360 --> 50:27.360
Maybe they really haven't gotten the religion of good password hygiene.

50:27.360 --> 50:35.360
And I just I got to just say, like, there are so many things you could do, but there's really one thing you must do to protect yourself online.

50:35.360 --> 50:39.360
And that is using a unique password at every website, every service, every app.

50:39.360 --> 50:46.360
And now you can combine that with a unique username and a unique email address and keep it all in Bitwarden and get access to it super quick.

50:46.360 --> 50:48.360
On my iPhone, I have it set up with face ID.

50:48.360 --> 50:52.360
So when it's time to fill out a password, I pull my phone up, it scans my damn face, puts it right in there.

50:52.360 --> 50:55.360
Boom. You know what? Next thing you know, I've unlocked the site or whatever.

50:55.360 --> 50:58.360
It's so easy. I can't believe people aren't doing it all the time.

50:58.360 --> 51:05.360
I feel like I want to like parachute down and give people Bitwarden to save them from some password mess they're probably living in.

51:05.360 --> 51:11.360
Maybe just be easier if everybody went to Bitwarden.com slash Linux and tried it out for themselves or your business.

51:11.360 --> 51:15.360
You know, maybe you got an open source team that could use some good password hygiene.

51:15.360 --> 51:18.360
Any of that. Go try it out. Share it with a friend.

51:18.360 --> 51:26.360
Tell somebody about it and support the show. Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

51:26.360 --> 51:35.360
Some quick feedback this week. Greg wrote in about us trying out this new fangled video thing when we're doing the livestream.

51:35.360 --> 51:39.360
Oh, no. Oh, wait. I put my shirt back on.

51:39.360 --> 51:45.360
You put cameras in the studio again? You know, we're always consuming illegal substances while we podcast. You can't do that.

51:45.360 --> 51:49.360
You know, last time I was there, I did that and I thought, I'm just going to wait a few months before turning them on.

51:49.360 --> 51:51.360
They'll never notice.

51:51.360 --> 51:57.360
Greg writes, I just watched Linux unplugged 4.6.0. I want to add my thumbs up for the video version.

51:57.360 --> 52:03.360
I really miss the video versions of Lass and TechSnap and Stoked. Thank you for the great shows.

52:03.360 --> 52:09.360
Well, thank you, Greg. I don't have a lot of thoughts on it because we're trying to be really low key about the fact that we're doing video.

52:09.360 --> 52:11.360
It's true. We're not making a big deal. It's not a big deal.

52:11.360 --> 52:15.360
We're not going to put too much effort into it and we're not going to ruin the audio shows.

52:15.360 --> 52:17.360
It's just a little bit of extra fun on the side.

52:17.360 --> 52:23.360
It's really just because so many dang people are working from home now and sitting at their desks and we can do it too.

52:23.360 --> 52:27.360
And it's something that I kind of wouldn't mind easing back into the right way and taking our time.

52:27.360 --> 52:31.360
So if someone maybe would want to check it out, where would they go, Chris?

52:31.360 --> 52:34.360
If they wanted to see some of our video stuff.

52:34.360 --> 52:42.360
Great question. Jupiter.Tube. Jupiter.Tube is where the live streams will be and the archives of those plus other specials that we upload.

52:42.360 --> 52:46.360
Stuff like that. Jupiter.Tube. That's a great question, isn't it?

52:46.360 --> 52:51.360
I think we may have also mentioned it on the latest Office Hours if you want to check that out.

52:51.360 --> 52:54.360
OfficeHours.hair.

52:54.360 --> 52:57.360
And now it is time for Le Boost.

52:57.360 --> 53:02.360
Limiting Factor wrote in with a thousand sats about Tumbleweed.

53:02.360 --> 53:08.360
It always feels like discovery in GNOME software is an afterthought to the distro.

53:08.360 --> 53:11.360
Not just Tumbleweed, but especially Tumbleweed.

53:11.360 --> 53:16.360
Yeah, I think that's because it sits on top of package kit, which then sits on top of the actual package manager.

53:16.360 --> 53:17.360
There's a lot of layers going on.

53:17.360 --> 53:19.360
You think that might be part of it?

53:19.360 --> 53:21.360
It's kind of impressive that it works at all some days.

53:21.360 --> 53:33.360
Yeah, I think this is in reference to my mentioning how I was having a hard time with discovery kind of hiccuping with trying to help me solve the problem last week on my Tumbleweed install here.

53:33.360 --> 53:37.360
And I think that's a pretty accurate description of how it felt.

53:37.360 --> 53:40.360
It was like, oh, yeah, this just isn't going to work for me.

53:40.360 --> 53:45.360
If you're doing the one use case, which is like updating your system and everything's going really well.

53:45.360 --> 53:49.360
Perfect. But as soon as something goes wrong, it's not really that helpful.

53:49.360 --> 53:54.360
But then again, maybe you shouldn't be running Tumbleweed if you're that kind of person.

53:54.360 --> 53:57.360
Maybe. Although, Tumbleweed can be for everyone.

53:57.360 --> 54:00.360
Boosting in with another row of ducks.

54:00.360 --> 54:02.360
That's three hundred people over here.

54:02.360 --> 54:05.360
Two thousand two hundred and twenty two sats six days ago.

54:05.360 --> 54:11.360
All this next talk and the new graphical calamari installer makes me want to switch to Nix on a system or two.

54:11.360 --> 54:13.360
Hey, more power to you, Golden Dragon.

54:13.360 --> 54:16.360
You got this. Let us know how it goes.

54:16.360 --> 54:18.360
I love it. The road ducks always makes me smile.

54:18.360 --> 54:24.360
It always does. User 309 boosted in two days ago with 5000 sats.

54:24.360 --> 54:27.360
Hey, Chris, longtime listener and supporter.

54:27.360 --> 54:30.360
I wanted to boost you up and give you some unsolicited advice.

54:30.360 --> 54:36.360
Well, first of all, I think when I ask you to boost that is solicited advice. So love the video content.

54:36.360 --> 54:40.360
But stop dicking around and get Brent a proper setup for his house.

54:40.360 --> 54:43.360
Calling you out right here on the show.

54:43.360 --> 54:45.360
Calling me out. Calling me out.

54:45.360 --> 54:48.360
You know, I think that's because Brent was grousing on office hours. Right.

54:48.360 --> 54:50.360
So now the audience is coming to his defense.

54:50.360 --> 54:54.360
I tell you what. Sorry, Chris. But, you know, Wes and I were talking about this before the show.

54:54.360 --> 54:58.360
We really, really think it's time for Brent to get a new computer.

54:58.360 --> 55:00.360
That's part one, right? It's bandwidths, too.

55:00.360 --> 55:02.360
But it's also his computer.

55:02.360 --> 55:08.360
And so Wes and JB are going to go in on a brand new HP dev one for Brent.

55:08.360 --> 55:12.360
We haven't told Brent yet. So surprise, Brent, you're getting a new computer.

55:12.360 --> 55:14.360
That's amazing. I really like I like the dev one.

55:14.360 --> 55:17.360
So you're getting one. It's going to be your podcast machine.

55:17.360 --> 55:21.360
So that'll help with the compute. You only have to use one computer now.

55:21.360 --> 55:23.360
There you go. I'm really excited to find out how you managed to break it.

55:23.360 --> 55:26.360
Well, I promise to find a way.

55:26.360 --> 55:30.360
Well, that's just it. Actually, you are JB's chief QA man.

55:30.360 --> 55:32.360
You are the QA chief.

55:32.360 --> 55:35.360
And honestly, why not?

55:35.360 --> 55:37.360
Why not throw a little Brent QA at this thing?

55:37.360 --> 55:41.360
Because HP actually has dedicated staff just for the dev one.

55:41.360 --> 55:44.360
Oh, so I can call them up and tell them they need something to do.

55:44.360 --> 55:46.360
You're saying Brent can whip them into shape.

55:46.360 --> 55:48.360
Right. They got to justify keeping them around.

55:48.360 --> 55:51.360
I think we know a few people at System 76's QA who.

55:51.360 --> 55:57.360
Yeah. Would love to hear hear me come in with a few little maybe challenges for them.

55:57.360 --> 56:01.360
And I really think this is first of all, I think this is a laptop that people are going to be skeptical about.

56:01.360 --> 56:04.360
And I think they have some justification and being skeptical about it.

56:04.360 --> 56:07.360
They could be skeptical about pop or they could be skeptical about HP.

56:07.360 --> 56:12.360
What are their skepticals about? I think there's going to be some and I think it's probably going to be somewhat justified.

56:12.360 --> 56:20.360
But I think as time goes on and more people get their hands on and you're going to see a whole bunch of reviews dropping over this weekend in the next few days because everybody's finally getting you know, they've been doing the work.

56:20.360 --> 56:23.360
I think you're going to see that that opinion shift.

56:23.360 --> 56:27.360
And so I would like us to have a long term picture on this as well.

56:27.360 --> 56:30.360
So that's part of it is you can help us QA and test this thing.

56:30.360 --> 56:32.360
You know, I mean, if you stop doing the show, you might have to give it back to you.

56:32.360 --> 56:35.360
So maybe maybe that's maybe we would. Yeah.

56:35.360 --> 56:37.360
Make that a rule. Yeah. There you go.

56:37.360 --> 56:39.360
I think I'm strangely OK with it.

56:39.360 --> 56:43.360
It'll only take a couple of days. I don't know how we're going to get it to you because it's probably going to arrive while I'm in Montana.

56:43.360 --> 56:45.360
But it'll arrive at the studio. We'll order it tonight.

56:45.360 --> 56:47.360
It'll probably be here by Monday or Tuesday.

56:47.360 --> 56:52.360
So you want me to house it at the studio? That's that's really where you're going with this.

56:52.360 --> 56:57.360
But I want you to QA it for us and I'll give you give you a better base to do the shows with.

56:57.360 --> 57:00.360
So, you know, user 309 was right. Well, that's sweet.

57:00.360 --> 57:03.360
Thank you very much. User 309. Thank you for inspiring Chris.

57:03.360 --> 57:05.360
Chris, thank you for inspiring me.

57:05.360 --> 57:08.360
They also noted that we should be putting chapters in the damn live show.

57:08.360 --> 57:13.360
The supporters deserve it. To be fair, to be fair, we did try that last week.

57:13.360 --> 57:17.360
We did. Yeah. We had a bit of a technical failing in that.

57:17.360 --> 57:20.360
But we got started and tried. Yeah. And we're going to try it again.

57:20.360 --> 57:26.360
I don't promise a lot of chapters, but, you know, if you want to if you want to skip past all the shenanigans,

57:26.360 --> 57:29.360
well, you could just get the ad free version, which is just a nice tight production.

57:29.360 --> 57:34.360
You got two options, but we will. We're going to try to start dropping some chapters.

57:34.360 --> 57:38.360
We're kind of rigging up a whole new back end for some of our live stuff.

57:38.360 --> 57:41.360
So, yes, that's one of the things.

57:41.360 --> 57:44.360
And the number three, he says we are restricting the growth of the network

57:44.360 --> 57:51.360
substantially by not making the video content available to the enormous tech YouTube audience.

57:51.360 --> 57:53.360
Take the plunge. The views will be their best of luck.

57:53.360 --> 57:57.360
Snapdragon. I disagree with Snapdragon on the YouTube thing.

57:57.360 --> 58:01.360
I love YouTube. I love watching me some YouTube as a viewer.

58:01.360 --> 58:04.360
I enjoy YouTube as a content creator.

58:04.360 --> 58:10.360
I think YouTube is a dark path and I'm not really convinced that I want to bother with it.

58:10.360 --> 58:14.360
And I also don't really care if thousands of people don't watch the video.

58:14.360 --> 58:18.360
We got JupiterTube, but I'm not totally like dead set on that.

58:18.360 --> 58:20.360
I might consider it one day. I don't know.

58:20.360 --> 58:24.360
But that's where my views are at right now, and I don't want us to fuss with it too much.

58:24.360 --> 58:26.360
I want us to stay focused on the audio. Yeah, that's fair.

58:26.360 --> 58:31.360
Make sure the audio is great, but we don't have like a super compelling video product at the moment.

58:31.360 --> 58:35.360
And yeah, you're right. If we go down that road too far, that's a whole rabbit hole.

58:35.360 --> 58:40.360
I give Chris a little credit. I mean, he threw us into his like KDE setup and he's got the...

58:40.360 --> 58:43.360
Which application am I sitting in? Is that a terminal?

58:43.360 --> 58:46.360
Yeah, I put you in console. You're getting there. It's pretty creative.

58:46.360 --> 58:49.360
Yeah, I mean, we've gone from like zero to 60 pretty darn fast. Don't get me wrong.

58:49.360 --> 58:53.360
It's just that, you know, we don't have like, I know Chris's standards.

58:53.360 --> 58:56.360
And like, if he's trying to make like, you know, like a YouTube production,

58:56.360 --> 58:58.360
he's going to want to be competitive with what's out there now.

58:58.360 --> 59:02.360
We're going to need a few more boosts, Snapdragon, to get there.

59:02.360 --> 59:05.360
Now, if you send us a boost and you didn't hear it on this show.

59:05.360 --> 59:07.360
B-O-O-S-T

59:07.360 --> 59:10.360
Don't worry. We're going to do another batch of boosts in the next episode.

59:10.360 --> 59:14.360
We're doing a double today. And so we wanted to spread them out a little bit.

59:14.360 --> 59:16.360
And we do appreciate your boosts.

59:16.360 --> 59:20.360
You can send us one in by getting a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

59:20.360 --> 59:24.360
Pick one that's right for you. I like to use the strike app to grab my stats.

59:24.360 --> 59:28.360
But if you don't want to switch podcast apps, you can also grab the Breeze app at

59:28.360 --> 59:32.360
Breeze, B-R-E-E-Z dot technology.

59:32.360 --> 59:36.360
And then you can send a boost and keep your favorite podcast app.

59:36.360 --> 59:42.360
Now, speaking of podcast apps, we do have a pick that I've really been enjoying recently.

59:42.360 --> 59:49.360
I was looking for a podcasting 2.0 app that supported things like chapters,

59:49.360 --> 59:53.360
live streams, because that's something they're working on that I think is going to be super cool in the podcast app.

59:53.360 --> 59:54.360
And we're going to want to play with.

59:54.360 --> 59:58.360
I really had this mindset of I want to consume the same content mobile that I do at my desk.

59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.360
And Podverse fits in that really well.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:03.360
It's podcasting 2.0 compliant.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.360
It has a web version that's really nice.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:10.360
Oh, and it has an Android and iOS version that's really nice.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:15.360
It's it syncs across all of them. It's it'll do OPML imports.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:17.360
And of course, it supports value for value.

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.360
If you want to send a boost, it supports cloud chapters.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.360
It supports transcripts. It supports alternative tag enclosures.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:28.360
And it supports live audio and video streams for podcasting 2.0 apps.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.360
It's all in there. And it's such a nice app.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:37.360
And on top of that, Brent and I were joined by one of the co-creators on office hours this week.

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.360
And we got the details about like why they did it as a GPL app.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:46.360
And if they plan to make money on it, that kind of stuff, and why they publish an F-Droid and all of that.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:52.360
And I just really I support more apps that are this license with this kind of release scheme

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.360
that do the Play Store, that do iOS and do F-Droid.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.360
You can just get it everywhere. And it's podcasting 2.0.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.360
So I will link in the show notes to Podverse. It's podverse.fm.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:07.360
And I will also in there link directly to Linux Unplugged on Podverse as well as office hours.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:10.360
Well, you've sold me. I think I'm going to give it a try.

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.360
Yeah, just kick the tires a little bit. See what you think.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.360
I know people been pretty happy with Fountain, but not everybody has.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:18.360
And so there's a lot of options out there.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.360
And the fact that this one is FOSS is just so great.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:24.360
And GPL3 could do with more of that. We really could.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:29.360
And they've published components of it as open source as well, including the web player.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.360
That may be coming as an embeddable piece in the future.

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:37.360
Is that right? Yeah. An embeddable web player that supports all the podcasting 2.0 standards.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.360
It sounds like our website, future website, might need this.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.360
I see where you're going. I see that smile on your face.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.360
I love it. I love it.

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:48.360
My understanding is you like open source software. Yeah, I'm kind of a fan.

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:51.360
So I'd be good with that. I'd be good with that.

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:57.360
All right. Well, if you've got questions about the HP Dev1 or topic suggestions or another piece of hardware you'd like to have us look at.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:01.360
Send us an email Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact or send a boost into the show.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:05.360
We'd love to hear from you. Now, we will not be live next week.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:10.360
So this is normally the spot in the show where I'd say same bat time, same bat channel.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:14.360
But that ain't happening. I don't have a next bat time, next bat channel.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.360
I mean, we got to assume you make it back from your adventures.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.360
Yeah, who knows? I might get over to Montana and the price of gas might be so much cheaper.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.360
I might just stay there. I'm still thinking you might end up going north through picking up Brenton, Canada.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:30.360
Hey, that's an idea. Hand delivered laptop. I like it.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:34.360
Of course, Linux Action News rolls on. There's always more going on in the world of Linux.

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:38.360
You got a Linux Action News dot com for that.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.360
And of course, we'll be out at our regular release time.

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:46.360
If you subscribe like 98, 99 percent of everybody out there, they just get the show on the regulars.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:51.360
But you can get the links to what we talked about today at Linux Unplugged dot com slash 462, right?

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:57.360
462. This doesn't seem possible, Wes. I still feel like we just did 400. I still got some beer.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.360
But we're about to do 463, so prepare yourself.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:05.360
All right. Well, with that bombshell, that wraps up this week's episode of the unplugged program.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:23.360
We'll see you right back here next week.

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:49.360
Sounds like your studio winged beast just just took off there.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:53.360
You might want to close. Oh, yeah. The pet the pet eagle. I know. I know.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:57.360
I tried to get West to take it home, but it poops all over everything.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:01.360
Everything. Yeah. I'm just a little worried, you know, might attack my small dog.

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:06.360
Yeah. Well, there's that. It does try to eat the dogs, but watch out.

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.360
You got to dodge that thing. You got to watch out. I know.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:16.360
I've got some talent scars. I asked you not to make it, too, but you put our last good wireless mic on that damn eagle.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.360
I just don't even understand it. You know, for the Colin show. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:25.360
That makes sense. So, Chris, I'm I'm curious, are you going to bring this laptop on your trip?

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.360
I'm debating that right now because that's kind of a defining factor. If you do, then it's like, oh, wow.

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:37.360
Well, I thought I could, but then I thought I could also have West take it for a week while I'm gone and try it out, too.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:41.360
Interesting. Yeah. And, you know, that could be I mean, I don't know if you'd like to.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:44.360
I think that might be I mean, I wouldn't mind taking it, too.

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:50.360
But at the same time, I'd like to get, you know, your experience with it as a developer and, you know, somebody that's not me trying it.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.360
Oh, yeah. It can be fun to try to set up, put a video game on there, too.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:57.360
And I don't know what you do, you know, just to keep it clean.

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.360
Does Kexec work on that thing? I can find out.
