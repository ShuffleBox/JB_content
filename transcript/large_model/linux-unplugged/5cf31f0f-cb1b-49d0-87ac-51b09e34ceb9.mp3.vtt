WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
Well, that's a good question. So Wimpy, how could somebody who's just getting started in computer science help on projects like Ubuntu Mate?

00:06.600 --> 00:23.400
Oh, wow. Um, Ubuntu Mate is a bad project to pick because I have been very tardy and actually preparing the how to contribute page, which has been a work in progress for months and months and months. Other projects have better how to contribute pages.

00:23.400 --> 00:41.400
Um, some of the ways that you can contribute, um, translations, if you're, um, one of these lucky people that speaks and reads, writes more than one language, translations are always extremely welcome. Um, so, you know, that doesn't necessarily require, um, computer science skills.

00:41.400 --> 00:45.000
But what if they want to get their hands on the code? They want to, they want to, you know, code stuff.

00:45.000 --> 01:06.000
Um, the best thing to do in that respect is to find, um, where the developers for that project are talking to one another. In some cases, that might be an IRC channel, it might be slack or hip chat, or, you know, one of these live chat environments that will certainly be mentioned on the website somewhere.

01:06.000 --> 01:25.000
And the best thing to do is go to that place, introduce yourself, explain that you would like to get involved and, uh, maybe ask if there are any particular bugs that, um, either just need triaging to start with, as in there's a bug has been raised.

01:25.000 --> 01:33.000
Can you provide some more information? Can you reproduce the issue reliably? Um, and start to get familiar with code base.

01:33.000 --> 01:43.000
Be helpful there. That would be really helpful. Yep. Uh, make yourself known, be helpful. And by doing things like that, you get familiar with, because for example, Marte is a relatively small desktop project.

01:43.000 --> 01:52.000
I think there's about, um, 40 components, something like that, that make up the desktop, you know, compare that with KDE where there's about 300 components.

01:52.000 --> 02:08.000
So, um, it takes some time to actually learn what each of the components are, what its function is and how they interact. And as you start to learn that, then you can start to understand, uh, how you can help improve specific areas.

02:08.000 --> 02:24.000
So we've had somebody join, uh, Marte probably six or seven months ago as a sort of a regular contributor, and they are primarily looking after just one of the applications in the Marte desktop suite, rather than trying to get involved in everything.

02:24.000 --> 02:41.000
They've got an interest in making, um, and grandpa, which is the archive manager better focusing on that area. So you could pick, you know, a, a component within the, within the suite of tools that you are interested in most of all, and just focus on that.

02:41.000 --> 03:02.000
Um, because once you learn one area of the system, the rest tend to be similarly architected. I mean, I know that's true of, um, Gnome and Marte and KDE. Um, I can't speak to the other so much cause I've, I've not really looked at the code so much, but certainly find the developers where they're hanging out and join them there and have a conversation.

03:02.000 --> 03:19.000
I liked all your advice. I think a lot of times hard stuff is you should break a project that you're actively using so that you can maintain interest in it because a lot of times, like what you're saying, the biggest thing is just getting familiar with everything, learning one, how do I get everything up so I can even make code changes and submit them properly to, you know, find the things.

03:19.000 --> 03:32.000
And then when you do find bugs that either you've found or you want to fix with other things that you have the resources and you've already knocked down all those barriers, you know, who the right people to ask questions are, all of that. So when you're, you know, in a couple, in a year when you're like, Hey, I really want to make this go change. You have all the tools to do it.

03:32.000 --> 03:44.000
Those are great points. Yeah. Solve problems, get engaged and go to where they're at. And I think your point of sticking with something that you're passionate about. So that way you remain committed and have an interest.

03:44.000 --> 03:54.000
It's like documentation is a great way to do it. But if you don't use something, it's pretty hard to go improve docs. But if you're using it every day and you're like, wow, these docs could really be better. Here's the ways that I like it. Here's how it becomes much more natural.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Yeah.

03:55.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah. And some projects are looking for people that are interested in setting up continuous integration. You know, there's more and more of a shift to that now. You definitely see that from the DevOps scene and you're seeing it more on, you know, desktop and application development now.

04:11.000 --> 04:23.000
And you know, some projects just simply don't have the resources to do that stuff. So actually becoming a really valuable QA engineer in automating a lot of that work can be extremely valuable to the project.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
So it's the same as in the real world. You start out in QA and then you'll...

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
In some cases, helping build systems like that might not even require code initially. It could just be systems engineering.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Configuration.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Configuration.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Indeed.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
And you don't even have to be a developer to contribute that.

04:38.000 --> 04:57.000
Yeah. When I started with Marte, I was just doing packaging. I didn't do any code at all until a long time in before I had the time and the interest to really get involved. I was just doing packaging. And of course, that teaches you a lot about how the system works because you're actually, you know, stitching them together to make it all run.

04:57.000 --> 05:14.000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 184 for February 14th, 2017.

05:14.000 --> 05:27.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's going to change Android for you forever. And that's just us getting warmed up. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes. I am pumped about today's show.

05:27.000 --> 05:41.000
We got a good one and it's right before the beard apocalypse strikes Jupiter broadcast. There may be no network next week. Yeah, just like the mighty salmon. Just like the mighty salmon, the beard streams upstream, returns to main once a year.

05:41.000 --> 05:54.000
It's a little snowier, less water, more snow. I think it's way more snow. Yeah, maybe, maybe. But the beard, I mean, it'll freeze in place and protect him. Less hipsters, which allows him to recharge and refortify, which is really what he needs.

05:54.000 --> 06:06.000
And less flannel, I believe. I'm led to believe. Coming up on this week's show, we're going to get into some big news that's breaking today as we go on the air. Then we're going to discuss the sleeper desktop environment that came out of nowhere.

06:06.000 --> 06:23.000
It's apparently legit, ready to go. We're going to talk about our future plans and some upcoming events. Then getting into some really interesting ways of ripping Google's Play services out of your Android device, but not sacrificing the apps that require those APIs.

06:23.000 --> 06:35.000
And perhaps integrating the whole thing with F-Droid, that open source app store. We'll tell you about that. Then we'll dig into the state of snaps across different distributions.

06:35.000 --> 06:58.000
Then, I'm so excited about this, we'll dig into takeover.sh, a shell script that will wipe and reinstall a running Linux system via SSH. Then we'll tangent off into the Depenguinator, which our own Mr. Alan Jude, I believe, has had a role in this monster that is wiping out Linux systems and replacing them with FreeBSD.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
What?

06:59.000 --> 07:25.000
I'll tell you about this scandal later on in the show. Then last but not freaking least at all, and I hope William is able to stick around for this part too, Mr. Wes over here has been playing around with WireGuard, the fast, modern, secure VPN tunnel, which if I recall from our previous coverage, has that fancy asset of the fact that it's built into the Linux kernel to some extent.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
There's a module or some kernel component, right? It is a kernel module that will hopefully be upstream soon.

07:30.000 --> 07:40.000
So, we'll talk about that. Also, the coverage it recently got, how Wes' experience went. So that is a hell of a lot of show. I ran out of music. I ran out of music, Wes.

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
So before we can get into any of that, you know what we've got to do. We've got to say time-appropriate greetings to our virtual log. Hello, Mumble Room.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Hello. Hello.

07:49.000 --> 08:00.000
Hello, everybody. Good to have you here today. I wanted to start with some really up-and-front breaking news, big stuff that I think everybody has heard about at this point, I suspect.

08:00.000 --> 08:08.000
I have no idea what it means for things like Wire and Jitsi and other services, but Amazon has announced Chime.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
We used to work like this, and it was easy.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
They're in an office.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
But then things got more complicated.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
The internet, time zones, it's hard.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
And we started to work like this.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
I guess that's...

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
But it was obvious that there were some problems.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Over the internet.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Can anyone else hear Susan?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
AWS was down, so...

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
We had to deal with this...

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Hello.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
And this...

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Just one sec here. Let me see if I can find it.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
You know, I'm not at my desk right now. Can I call you back in a couple minutes?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
And a whole lot of this.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
A couple things I wanted to add to that. I think someone else just joined us. Who was that?

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
But now we have this.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Amazon Chime turns this...

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Into this.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Everybody, thanks for taking the time to check in.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
It frees us up to be mobile with seamless notifications, synced chats, and frustration-free meetings.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Hello, everyone.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
So this is a big play here.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
This is like taken on GoToMeeting, it's taken on Skype, it's taken on Office...

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I forget what the Office...

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
What's Microsoft?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Microsoft has like the...

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Is it Yammer?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Link.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Link, yes, thank you.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
It's taken on all of these.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
And obviously running on top of the AWS infrastructure.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
It's called Amazon Chime.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
And I don't think it's open source, gentlemen.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
Which is kind of disappointing in the age of WebRTC.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Yes. Yes, it is.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
And there's no Linux client as yet.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
What is this?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
What year is this, Amazon?

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
It's an interesting, obvious play for like the corporate enterprise.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
Yeah, it definitely is.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
We'll see if it takes off.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
I don't think it's really taking on like what we do.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
No, I don't think so either.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
And there's like a...

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
You know, it seems very...

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
I don't know how customer...

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
I have not played with it yet.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
But it doesn't seem like quite what we want, what were the problems we're trying to solve.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
But I could see it for like, hey, I want to have a conference of these people.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
We need to discuss this subject for this length of time.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Yeah.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
They run it on their existing infrastructure.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
They're going to use like...

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
They're going to have some of the features that some of the nicer Google Hangout features like

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
when there's excessive noise, it can maybe automatically mute somebody, has a clear roster.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
So I saw other people asking this question, but why didn't Hangouts do this already?

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
Well, I mean, Hangouts has been kind of doing this, but people also sort of...

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
It seems like there's been no innovation there.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Yeah, you're right.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
And it seems like what people do for business is they back their way into Hangouts.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
They kind of make it work for them.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
And Hangouts says, you know, they have some apps and stuff like that.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
But they definitely haven't put a dent in GoToMeeting like this will.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
I don't know.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
I'm just...

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
So they also have that AWS, like you get like a virtual desktop in the cloud product.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Yeah, yeah.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Maybe your startup and just your whole thing.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
You're hosted there.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Your desktops are there.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Geez.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
You just give people like Chromebooks or...

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
With some Amazon cloud storage.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Cloud storage.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Fire tablets.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Echoes in every room.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
God, dude.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Oh, and of course, Dash buttons.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
That way they can order office supplies with a touch of a button.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
All automatable with our friend.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
And soon arriving via drone.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Wow.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Yeah, they really are doing it all, aren't they?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Huh.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Wait and see.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
We will regret this day.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
You watch.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
We will regret the...

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
We will regret the Internet Walmart that we have created one day.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
But in the meantime, let's get back to more Linux-y things.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Things that are soundly in our wheelhouse.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
This is something that passed over me this week.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
And it didn't really land on me appropriately.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
This is a new Linux desktop environment.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
What?

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
What?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
This is a new desktop environment inspired by your good friend,

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
your old buddy, Windows 7.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
It was forked from Matei to create something, they say,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
better suited for their needs.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Who's they?

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Ubuntu Chillin', which is something we've talked about a little bit in the past.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
It's an official Chinese language spin of Ubuntu.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
It aims to provide a simpler and more enjoyable experience for browsing,

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
searching, and managing your computer.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Boy, it looks kind of spot on there.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I'm impressed.

12:10.000 --> 12:17.000
I am shocked that they've even made it this far this quickly.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
They've really got a Windows 7 look here.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
I mean, it really looks like Windows 7.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I remember screenshots of the old UI.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
It was much more cartoony.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
And this new one, geez, they've really got close here.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
So they have plans afoot to ship it as a default desktop in Ubuntu Chillin' 17.04,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
due in April.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
I wanted to ask Wimpy what he knew about this.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
And also specifically, I noted that they said they forked it from Matei.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
Is this, Wimpy, to your knowledge, is this a full-on fork of Matei?

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Not everything in Matei, no.

12:51.000 --> 12:57.000
They've forked some of the core components, really, for namespacing reasons.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
And this is so, if you look at some of the screenshots,

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
and even if you like, you can use the PPAs on 16.10 and 17.04,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
and actually run this stuff up,

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
you'll see that some of the applications have really had their looks changed radically.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
So they need to fork those things,

13:16.000 --> 13:22.000
because we're not going to change Kaja to look exactly like Windows Explorer, for example,

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
which, if you look at the screenshots, it's a very convincing replica.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
So in order to do those big style changes and fork,

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
they then need to change some of the underlying namespaces.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
And it looks like they've gone to quite a bit of effort to make sure that Matei,

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
and it's called UKUI, this new project, can co-exist.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
UKUI.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Ubuntu Kiling user interface, I think it's short for.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Not Chillin'?

13:49.000 --> 13:56.000
Well, Chillin' is the distro, so Ubuntu Chillin' is the distribution, the flavor.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
That's not confusing at all.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
So Chillin', for those of you that don't know, is spelled how?

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
K-Y-L-I-N.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
Yeah, okay. And Kiling is spelled...

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
I'm mispronouncing it. I'm mispronouncing Kiling.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
So Kiling is actually pronounced Chillin'.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Oh, okay. All right. Well, good.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Because otherwise my mind was going to melt wimpy.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
I couldn't handle it.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Too much.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Do you see the steam coming up?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Oh, yes.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
He's done. The show's over. Sorry, guys.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
We got to go.

14:24.000 --> 14:30.000
All right. So have you had a chance to dig around this project at all?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
It doesn't sound like it's...

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
I did.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Okay.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
Yeah, I had a little poke around their GitHub repos last night.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Because until yesterday I hadn't heard about this at all.

14:41.000 --> 14:47.000
I saw the bug turn up in the issue tracker in Ubuntu for packaging requests.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Yesterday morning.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
And I sort of did a double take.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Yeah.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
When it was like the first line is it's forked from Marte.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
I was like, really?

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
What? Yeah.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
This is a third generation fork now because it was Gnome 2, it was Marte.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
And now we've got another fork from it.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
It's like children.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
And I didn't have time to really look at it until the evening.

15:12.000 --> 15:19.000
But yeah, they've forked, I don't know, maybe a dozen components, something like that.

15:19.000 --> 15:30.000
All the core stuff, things to do with keyboard handling, session management, the settings daemon and then policy kit and the file manager and a few bits like that.

15:30.000 --> 15:37.000
They've obviously got their own super sexy Windows 7-esque theme that sits on top of it all.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Very aero.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Yeah.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
And then they've got a couple of new components.

15:41.000 --> 15:56.000
So they've changed the panel a bit and they've used a new panel applet to do the indicator integration, which I'm going to take a closer look at because that looks quite tidy.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
It really does.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
And that could be reused in Ubuntu Marte, for example.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
So I want to have a closer look at that.

16:04.000 --> 16:14.000
And they've also taken so there's mint menu, which I forked as Marte menu and they forked again as UK UI menu.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
But they've absolutely stripped it back to like the bare essentials.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Oh, really?

16:19.000 --> 16:26.000
And yeah, and that looks quite interesting as well because we've obviously got Brisk now, which has just entered the scene for Marte.

16:26.000 --> 16:39.000
And this is another menu that is more efficient than Marte menu and mint menu and has search capabilities, but some of the traditional categorization.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
So there's a couple of interesting things that have come out of this that we'll have to take a closer look at.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Cool.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Earlier today.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Yeah.

16:46.000 --> 16:53.000
So earlier today I reached out to that team and basically said, you know, come and introduce yourselves to the Marte developers.

16:53.000 --> 17:00.000
We'd certainly be interested in talking to you and also to see if we can maybe reduce the forking effort.

17:00.000 --> 17:07.000
You know, maybe there are things we can do in Marte to accommodate what they need to do so they don't have to fork as much stuff.

17:07.000 --> 17:15.000
And that way we get more developers looking at the same code rather than independent streams.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
So we'll see if anything comes of that.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
We'll just have to have to wait and see.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
But I hope so.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
What a random development.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
This is totally on my radar.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
How the open source kind of crosses borders here and brings diverse communities together.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
Yeah, right. Because this has been this is a Chinese, primarily Chinese development.

17:31.000 --> 17:39.000
This was this was random to me until I spoke to one of the guys I work with and he explained some of the history and said that they'd been talking.

17:39.000 --> 17:47.000
The Chilean team had been talking about creating a Windows-esque environment for some time.

17:47.000 --> 18:01.000
And it sounds as though they did it earlier in the year or later last year because I believe this was like a preview session you could log into on 1610.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
And now they're making a push to make it the default for 1704.

18:05.000 --> 18:15.000
And it seems to me that I would guess that the idea here is you're trying to maybe reach out to potential Windows 7 and 10 pirates and say,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
here's a legitimate operating system you could install.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
It functions much like you would expect.

18:19.000 --> 18:28.000
I think also there's a reluctance probably to continue to follow Windows 10 and the future versions of Windows outside of Western countries.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
So this seems like it could perfectly fill that niche.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Yeah.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Or actually not even a niche.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
It's not a niche at all.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
It's the opposite of a niche.

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
What I was told is that in China, people want to use Windows.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
That's what they're familiar with.

18:44.000 --> 18:58.000
And some of the computers that are sold with Ubuntu Chilin pre-installed, there are reports that people are just taking their hooky copy of Windows and wiping over it and putting Windows back on it.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
I've heard that too.

18:59.000 --> 19:05.000
Because Unity is a bit of a departure from the way Windows 7 looks and operates.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Right.

19:06.000 --> 19:15.000
And you may remember relocating the Unity 7 launcher to the bottom of the screen.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
That actually came from the Chilin project.

19:17.000 --> 19:23.000
That was their contribution to try and make Unity more Windows-like.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
And so they've just taken it further now.

19:25.000 --> 19:32.000
They're going for a far more Windows look and feel type desktop arrangement.

19:32.000 --> 19:38.000
It sounds like if your user base is hooked on the Windows UI sauce, you've got to make more sauce.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
So you're saying, no, I'll be using this.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Yeah.

19:40.000 --> 19:49.000
I think it could be a double-edged sword though, because if it looks like something that it isn't, if it looks like Windows, there's the expectation it will work like Windows.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
And then the frustrations will set in when that isn't the case.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Perhaps.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
I think it has to be managed quite carefully, those expectations.

19:56.000 --> 20:05.000
Do you suppose they're rolling the dice that if you give them a web browser and a couple of decent things to do locally, that's going to meet the majority of the needs?

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Yeah, I'd be guessing.

20:06.000 --> 20:13.000
But until I get to speak to them, I can't really say what their thoughts are.

20:13.000 --> 20:20.000
But yeah, it looks like they're trying to appease those people that want something that works like Windows by giving them something far closer to that.

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
Did you get a sense at all of what version of Mete they forked from?

20:25.000 --> 20:36.000
Yeah, when I wrote in the issue tracker earlier, it wasn't clear to me how they'd forked, because the way they forked this is a little bit unusual.

20:36.000 --> 20:45.000
And in fact, ironically, it's the same unusual way that Mete was forked originally way, way back when that was forked from Gnome 2.

20:45.000 --> 20:55.000
So I think what they've done is they've actually taken what are called the Debian source packages, either from the Ubuntu archive or from one of my PPAs.

20:55.000 --> 21:03.000
And I was concerned that they'd actually forked the GTK2 builds, but I had a closer look earlier and they have actually forked from GTK3.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
Oh good, that was where I was going.

21:06.000 --> 21:12.000
But the problem here is that they've forked from the Debian source packages and then committed those to Git.

21:12.000 --> 21:29.000
So there's no Git history, so we can't see precisely where they've branched from our stuff, which means that if we want to cherry pick bits and pieces from their project to ours or vice versa, that then is a bit more complicated.

21:29.000 --> 21:35.000
So that's a bit unfortunate, but that ship sailed now, so we just have to get over that.

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
Well, I'll have a link in the show notes if you are listening and want to check it out.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
I think you can also download it, it looks like, because a Joey did over at OMG Ubuntu downloaded it.

21:45.000 --> 21:54.000
Yeah, there's an ISO image, or if you've got an Ubuntu, I think it's 16.10 or 17.04, maybe both, there's a PPA as well.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
That might even be a better way to go.

21:56.000 --> 22:17.000
Quick question guys, I'm assuming that there's an English build of Qilin, right, and let's say if you were to try to give it to a stereotypical Windows 7 user, they would probably pretty much easily be able to adapt to it?

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Yeah.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
What are some explanations as to what's going on?

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
I think that's kind of the idea, because if you look at the article, I'll have a link in the show notes, it's all in English.

22:24.000 --> 22:40.000
The only caution there is that Ubuntu Qilin itself is default Chinese language, so if you download Ubuntu Qilin, it's Chinese until you tell it you want a different language.

22:40.000 --> 22:47.000
So just be aware of that, you just need to be able to spot your language and go with it.

22:47.000 --> 22:54.000
Do you think we'd be able to get into the source code for the Iceland to change the default language to English?

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
Or if you add it as a PPA, just add it as a PPA to your existing list.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
That then picks up the local and regional settings you've already configured.

23:03.000 --> 23:14.000
I saw one of the Linux YouTubers had actually done an install of the PPA over the top of Marte, so I'll ping you a link for that a little bit later, because he's sort of given it a run through.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Very good.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
If I remember, I will drop a link in the show notes.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
So that's interesting, and if you hear anything more about it, let us know.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Oh, will do.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Wimpy's now on the beat, Wes, you like that?

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Oh, yes I do.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Thank you, Wimpy.

23:27.000 --> 23:36.000
All right, so Wes, you found a series of links that could be fundamentally a game changer for Android users in the audience.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
You can effectively use Android without Google Play services.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
Now don't get too excited, this is kind of like a multi-part solution, so buckle up, we're not quite there yet.

23:45.000 --> 23:51.000
But imagine a world in where this has sort of been smoothed out, and it's really kind of simple.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
So I personally have experimented a while trying to use Android without Google Play services,

23:56.000 --> 24:01.000
and while this article sort of points out the security reasons why you wouldn't want to use Google Play,

24:01.000 --> 24:09.000
I walked away realizing that I got like a day and a half to two day battery life improvement when I didn't use Google Play services on the Nexus phone.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
So that alone almost made me not want to.

24:12.000 --> 24:20.000
And custom ROMs like LineageOS proposed by default that Google Play services free version be an optimal installation

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
and then make Google Play services like a secondary option you choose.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
So that's sort of where Momentum is at right now.

24:25.000 --> 24:31.000
A major drawback when you don't have Google Play services installed is you cannot use any of the official Google applications

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
like the Google Play app to install more apps.

24:33.000 --> 24:39.000
But of course, F-Droid is out there, it's not really full of everything you might want,

24:39.000 --> 24:48.000
but it does have a lot of good apps like K9 Mail, Firefox, Nextcloud, TTRSS Reader, and lots of other ones.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
But check this out, Wes, check this out.

24:52.000 --> 25:02.000
The author of this post was experimenting around and came across a project, an open source project called G Play Web.

25:02.000 --> 25:09.000
G Play Web allows you to easily download applications from Google Play with a simple response of WebEye.

25:09.000 --> 25:15.000
It uses G Play CI, an unofficial library to download applications from Google Play.

25:15.000 --> 25:21.000
I think it's like using like Docker in the background and all kinds of stuff.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
I didn't read that far into it because that wasn't the part that I cared about.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
This is the part I cared about.

25:26.000 --> 25:32.000
He says, I forked this project on GitHub to use the latest version of G Play CLI and F-Droid server.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
So now I can easily install, oh yeah, he says he published it as a Docker.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Okay, yeah, so he does have it out there as a Docker.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.000
So now with this kind of tool, you have a web interface to easily download applications from Google Play

25:43.000 --> 25:49.000
and then an optional integration into the F-Droid app which creates custom F-Droid repositories

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
to install and update more applications as you need them.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
So suddenly, through F-Droid, you can install Google Play apps.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
Yeah, because you're running G Play CLI on a Docker image.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Maybe up on a droplet or something in Docker.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
Sure, and then it's creating this private repository for you.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
So that solves the Play Store without having Google Play.

26:08.000 --> 26:13.000
You should note that it only works because the G Play web is backed by G Play CLI.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
That only supports free, gratis applications.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
So if you have some apps that you paid for that you need, maybe it won't work.

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
Yeah, and it's not a complete solution for a couple of other huge reasons too

26:25.000 --> 26:30.000
because it doesn't provide the Play API, which a ton of these applications, once you install them,

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
expect, like Google's own applications.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
So when I read that, I was like, man, this is great because it makes it available for us to get a lot more software

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
from the Play Store, and a lot of the apps I use from the Play Store are honestly free.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
And maybe they have like an in-app purchase or something.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
So that was like, okay, all right, well this is cool.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
It's not quite there yet.

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
You could do it yourself if you're up for it, but you only get the apps angle.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
You still need the API angle.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Ho hum.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
And then that's when I saw Wes's link for Micro G,

27:00.000 --> 27:07.000
a free as in freedom re-implementation of Google's proprietary Android user space apps and libraries.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
Now we're starting to get closer to replacing the Play API.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Have no illusion, it's not a complete replacement.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Let me break this down for you.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Most Micro G components are far from complete,

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
so even the ones it does support are far from complete.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
The users are amazed by the results, though, they say.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
Free software users got to extend application support.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
Privacy-carrying users are able to reduce or monitor data that's sent to Google.

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
Because you have control over this stuff, you could put interesting monitoring in the middle of it.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
That's fascinating.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
This could be great for security research.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
And they say also older phone users are reporting dramatic better battery life.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Oh, wow.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
Micro G is not only used on real devices, but also replaces Google tools in test emulators.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Yeah, that's interesting.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Very interesting.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
So right now it offers GMS core.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
It's a library app providing the functionality required to run apps that use the Google Play services

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
or Google Maps API version 2.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Wow.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Wow.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Full stop wow right there.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
They also have the service framework proxy.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.000
It's a smaller help utility to allow apps developed for Google Cloud device messaging

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
to use the compatible Google Cloud messaging service included with GMS core.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
So they're taking care of the messaging angle, too.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Huge, huge.

28:20.000 --> 28:25.000
Unified network location provider is a library that provides Wi-Fi and cell tower-based geolocation

28:25.000 --> 28:31.000
to applications that use Google's network location provider.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Nice.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I'm just blown away.

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
Maps API is a system library providing the same functionality as now depreciated Google Maps API 1.

28:40.000 --> 28:45.000
And Store is a front-end application providing access to Google Play Store to download and update applications,

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
which development is in the early stage and there's no usable application yet.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
But they're working on it.

28:52.000 --> 28:58.000
Now you combine the F-Droid combo thing which you're using the G Play CLI to download.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Actually get the apps.

28:59.000 --> 29:05.000
And F-Droid to manage them on your phone and update them and also install great open source apps.

29:05.000 --> 29:14.000
Then Micro G to replace the Google Play API stuff and the location stuff.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
This is a huge development I think.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Two separate or three separate projects, right?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Three separate or four separate projects?

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
A lot of separate projects here.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
If you look at the individual like G Play CLI stuff and G Play Web.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
A lot of moving pieces.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
It's interesting.

29:30.000 --> 29:35.000
I think there's still also there's obviously problems with the Android ROM.

29:35.000 --> 29:42.000
Anytime you're getting away from Google's upstream then do you lose the benefits of the monthly patches if you do have those kinds of things?

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Yeah.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
There's a lot of good questions.

29:45.000 --> 29:54.000
But it also seems like there's a lot of opportunities to monitor applications and how they use the API and how it behaves and what kind of information it's exposing and sending.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Even if it's not you and I who are using this.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
It seems like there is a lot of useful things on the edges for researchers or developers.

30:00.000 --> 30:18.000
But it also makes it feel like maybe something like LineageOS with no Google Play services by default a year down the road could be a really feasible option for those of us who want a day more of battery life and don't want Google tracking us constantly.

30:18.000 --> 30:28.000
But we'd need Android for work or you know like Popeye's come on and said yeah I have to have Android because my bank only makes an Android app and that's how I have to interact with them.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
There's a lot of people that have that story.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
This would be amazing.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Super excited about this.

30:33.000 --> 30:41.000
This is like the big discovery of the week for me is that we really could be getting there and I didn't think that we would be able to do this.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
It felt like unachievable.

30:44.000 --> 30:49.000
Maybe it will always be a race against Google but wow Wes.

30:49.000 --> 30:54.000
Well I think there's another component here that we need if we're going to have going to have Android playing a little bit better.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Was that.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Well what do we do about the carrier.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
You know that's a good point.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
That's a damn good point.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
You got to go to Ting make the whole package Linux dot Ting dot com.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Not like any other carrier.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
If you if you if you want to play that in that game sure you go over there you sign up for a duopoly.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
You can play that.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Here's the problem.

31:10.000 --> 31:16.000
Once you even start getting a plan you're all you're already is part of the system is too late.

31:16.000 --> 31:22.000
A plan is never going to work for you because there's going to be months where you didn't need all those minutes.

31:22.000 --> 31:27.000
There's going to be months where you needed more minutes or megabytes or messages.

31:27.000 --> 31:39.000
I know for me I've never ever ever once in the years in years sent more than 10 text messages a month because I do everything over every other messaging platform that uses data.

31:39.000 --> 31:46.000
I don't I do not use text messages except for very rare alerts or like authorizing places to fly with my drone.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Like that's what I use text messages for.

31:48.000 --> 31:54.000
So this kind of stuff is this is where they get you in Ting is different thing is you only pay for what you use.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
It's six dollars for the line and then your usage on top of that.

31:57.000 --> 32:05.000
Now imagine a scenario where you have family members you want to have multiple accounts or you are a small business and you want to have multiple lines.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Six dollars for each line.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
No other carrier can match that.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
That is an unbeatable price and you only pay for what you use.

32:13.000 --> 32:18.000
So if you have Wi-Fi in the house and in your office why would you pay for data when you're not using it.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
It doesn't make any sense.

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
They've tricked you into it and Ting is doing it differently and they match that with incredible customer service.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
You speak to a real human being.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
They've got a great dashboard and apps to manage your account.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
You can turn devices off.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
You can set limits and alerts.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
It's so nice.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
I really appreciate that.

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
And then I think the favorite thing for Ting when I'm traveling.

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
My favorite thing when I'm on the road is the fact that they have CDMA and GSM services.

32:44.000 --> 32:50.000
And I bring one of each because it's six dollars and I need to be connected.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
It's part of my business.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I might have business papers I've got to take care of.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
So I need that.

32:54.000 --> 32:58.000
Six dollars a month for a CDMA line and a GSM line.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
That's my no brainer.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
You want to call in that hamburger order.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
How are you going to do it?

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
How am I going to listen into how you and Nor are screwing up the show if I don't have connectivity when I'm on the road.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I love you guys.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
Also I think Ting is pretty cool with this whole Ring Plus situation.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
There's a lot of Ring Plus shenanigans going down.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
Things are falling apart and Ting has swept in and they're really hooking people up.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
And you can read about it on their blog.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
It just shows what a great company they are.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Check it out.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Go to linux.ting.com.

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
And also while you're there, even if you're not ready to sign up yet, why not read the blog.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Lots of good stuff there for cord cutters too.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Linux.ting.com.

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
And thanks to Ting for sponsoring the unplugged program.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Thank you very, very much.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
All right.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
It's that time of the year when we've got big events coming up.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
Scale is very soon.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Noah will be down at scale.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
Wow.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
So soon.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
That's awesome.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
And I think we'll do last live from there.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
He'll do last live from there.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
I'll be back here at the studio.

33:56.000 --> 34:03.000
And then shortly after that, Linux Fest Northwest 2017 is going on.

34:03.000 --> 34:08.000
Linux Fest is the show that's always the kind of the one we go all in at every year because it's here in our backyard.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
We love the folks that run it.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
It's in Bellingham, Washington, May 6 and the 7th.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
And the thread was started by Sidley09.

34:16.000 --> 34:21.000
The subreddit says, is last going to go to Linux Fest Northwest?

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Yes.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Last will be.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
Last will be there for two days.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
We'll be live both two days like we always are.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Nice.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
We'll have a good crew there.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
You're going to make it, right, Wes?

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Oh, yeah.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
I love it.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
And we always have a good time.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
It's an awesome time.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
I'm going to bring Lady Joups up there.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Nice.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
I'll have the lady up there.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
We'll have Noah in town.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
Angela will be there to say hi to everybody.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
We'll probably have to swag.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
There's always a ton of awesome booths.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
We'll do a live show on Sunday from there of the Linux action show.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
I've always loved that people come by and watch the show live.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
That's the real live experience.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
It's a real treat.

34:56.000 --> 35:01.000
We basically only do it once a year in front of a group, so it's a good place to catch it.

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
And plus, the other thing that's really great about it, if you're going to make the trip out,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Washington is remarkably beautiful.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
The Pacific Northwest in general is very beautiful.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
And Bellingham is very eclectic.

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
It's very Washington in a lot of different ways.

35:17.000 --> 35:22.000
And so if you're going to come out here and you don't necessarily want to be in the crazy downtown Seattle area,

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
but you still want to get a good taste of Washington, Bellingham is a very unique way to do it.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Would you agree?

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
Oh, absolutely.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Yeah.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
So it's a fun town.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
It's worth traveling to.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
And I've got to be honest, it probably wouldn't be on your destination list otherwise,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
and you would be missing out.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
So check it out.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Linuxfestnorthwest.org if you're going to be there.

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
And I will link to the thread in the subreddit if you guys want to throw in.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
Oh, and he was asking about where to stay.

35:46.000 --> 35:53.000
If you go to linuxfest.org, slash 2017, slash travel, they have an area map with the hotels.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
Book soon because they do fill up.

35:56.000 --> 36:01.000
And for the JB crew, we'll be getting that all figured out here in the next couple of weeks too.

36:01.000 --> 36:07.000
So, yes, there's three really, none very close to Linuxfest.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
And don't bring your RV because that's my gig.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Don't do that.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
He's got tips, everyone.

36:12.000 --> 36:17.000
Anybody in the Bomba Room making plans to come out to Linuxfest Northwest?

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
I would like to try and make it this year.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
That would be awesome.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
Yeah, I'm really hoping.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
Wimpy, that's one of the reasons I'm most excited about this year is I'm hoping you're making it.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
I think you would really like it.

36:27.000 --> 36:32.000
And I think anybody that hasn't gone to an event like this,

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
even if you've gone to like corporate events, this is very unique.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
It's very welcoming.

36:37.000 --> 36:43.000
It's nearly 2,000 people, but it's at a large college campus, so there's space for everybody.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
It's not like it's awkward.

36:45.000 --> 36:50.000
It can get a little busy in the main event room, but I've seen a lot worse too.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
And they have on-location barbecuing that they do usually,

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
but there's also tons of really great food nearby.

36:57.000 --> 37:03.000
And it's a great feel because the whole event is put on by the Bellingham Linux Users Group.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
So it's not like it's some big commercial interest.

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
It's not like a company that they make profit from events.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
It is the Bellingham Linux Users Group who has been working with the Bellingham Technical College now for years,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
working together to host this event,

37:16.000 --> 37:23.000
and it has gotten large enough that it brings in large companies like Microsoft and Red Hat

37:23.000 --> 37:30.000
and sometimes Canonical and Hardware Management, lots of big companies, which you see in our coverage.

37:30.000 --> 37:40.000
But it still retains the roots of there's a lot of sessions to go to that are really well-run,

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
that are hosted by people that are authoritative on the topics.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Oh yeah, the sessions are great.

37:45.000 --> 37:51.000
And the whole thing has this very chill, relaxed feel to it because the Bellingham guys are just pretty chill guys.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
People are just hanging out, talking about Linux, sharing stories.

37:54.000 --> 37:59.000
So you get this really good mix of high-end vendors and speakers.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Also, this has been a long-running event.

38:01.000 --> 38:08.000
So you get this high-end mix that you normally would only get at California events or a New York event,

38:08.000 --> 38:14.000
really large events, but you get it here in a field that is more laid back and more community-driven.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
So they really nail it.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
Plus, Bellingham's got a lot of good breweries, so if that's your angle.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Yeah, they got a lot of good, a lot of things.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
They got a lot of good, a lot of things.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
That's what I'll just say to that. They really do.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
So yeah, check it out at Linux Fest.

38:27.000 --> 38:33.000
I don't have to go on and on about it, but the question has been raised and the answer is yes, we will be there.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
We will be there live.

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
They should do what Katie Easton and get you to narrate one of their ads.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Yeah, they should have ads.

38:41.000 --> 38:46.000
They also have the Linux Game Den, the Robotics Lab, the Arduino Hacking Lab,

38:46.000 --> 38:52.000
and every now and then, depending on the brewers, they also have a Linux Beer Brewery Lab.

38:52.000 --> 38:57.000
It kind of comes and goes depending on their schedule, but they have an automated brewing process running on Linux.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
And if they're there again this year, I am definitely getting another interview.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
And I'm going to ask where the hell their brewery is at so I can go there.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Because I run into them every other year.

39:06.000 --> 39:13.000
In fact, one year, they had a booth right next to our booth with the beer.

39:13.000 --> 39:19.000
And I don't know if they were supposed to be handing out beer, but I mean, somebody had beer

39:19.000 --> 39:26.000
and somebody was passing that beer on to me in little sippy cups over and over and over again while I was on the air.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Just to help the broadcast.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
And it is delicious. What are you going to do? It's delicious.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Well, I mean, if it's brewed by Linux.

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
It's super local, right? It's home batch, small batch, homegrown.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
So you can check out their travel page too, which I will link.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Wes, I'm going to drop this in the IRC.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
Will you link the travel page specifically in the show nizzles?

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
So that way folks listening that think they might make it can find it.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
All right. Then one other thing, just super quick from the subreddit.

39:52.000 --> 39:59.000
It looks like that whole Munich is dumping Linux and switching back to Windows.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Will they? Won't they?

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Well, now we're back on the they won't.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
This is unbelievable. It's the soap opera over here.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
And I got to just put a big disclaimer.

40:08.000 --> 40:13.000
We prerecorded the episode of Linux Action Show where we talk about this news story.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
And this hadn't come out yet.

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
And what this is, is not necessarily the whole thing is off.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
But that the motion to discuss it has moved.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
And so it's not necessarily on like they thought it was.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
So anyways, the correction is in the subreddit.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
And I wanted to make a big errata correction now.

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
Because in the future, you will hear an episode of Linux Action Show where we talk about this situation.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
And we talk about it without this context.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Go figure. Go figure.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
That never happens.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Nope. Never.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
The whole Munich thing is...

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
Hopefully by the time that airs, they've flopped back the other way.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
And then you'll be right.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
You know, I would just like them to switch.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Just get it over with.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Whatever you're going to do, do it.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Just cut it off.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
Just go to Windows. Go spend a ton of money.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
Go be wrong for a few years so we can stop talking about it.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
I'm so sick of it.

41:00.000 --> 41:06.000
But yeah, part of the reason the confusion here is because the news comes out and it's not in English.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
So there's a lot of translation happening.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
And the translation is sometimes wrong.

41:10.000 --> 41:19.000
And so thankfully, I think it was Clause4040 in the subreddit who was able to do some translation for us.

41:19.000 --> 41:25.000
And also to ChemBrotron who was following this closely and did some source linking for us.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
And interestingly, one of the things he linked has now been pulled down.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
But I really appreciate it.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
And they got 98 upvotes on the subreddit.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
So I wanted to make sure, yes, we saw it.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Hot news.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
That's right. Hot news.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
Okay.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
So before we move into a few more things,

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
I want to mention really quickly that there's been a big update on XFCE.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
A new task manager, which sounds actually pretty dope,

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
including one of the things that's really nice is as you click on Windows on your desktop,

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
it'll automatically highlight that process in the task manager.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
And it just looks really nice too.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
That's nice.

41:54.000 --> 41:59.000
Yeah. They're porting task manager to GTK3 and dropping support for GTK2.

41:59.000 --> 42:04.000
They say so far the GTK3 branch already works and has a feature parity with master.

42:04.000 --> 42:10.000
They're also working on the new notify D feature for XFCE.

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
Thunar 1.6.11, which is a maintenance release but does bring some important fixes.

42:14.000 --> 42:19.000
So Thunar is getting a new feature too with regards to copy.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
So I guess their point is, hey, XFCE, we're not dead yet.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Look at this great stuff coming out.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
They're going to work on some panel stuff soon.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
So there you go, Wes.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
It's your next desktop.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
I wanted to give them a quick mention.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I feel like nobody cares.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
But it's still a very good minimal desktop.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Do I need to stop covering it?

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Nobody cares.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
Look at this. Nobody cares.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
Yeah.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
Nobody cares.

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
I mean, their last update was like in 2015.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
I just checked their website earlier.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
I can't give up on it.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
It was like one of my first loves.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Yeah. I used it for a long time as well.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
I can't give up on it.

42:54.000 --> 42:59.000
But I'm not getting any reaction from the chat room, from the mumble room.

42:59.000 --> 43:04.000
I mean, is it like a good anti-soulless coverage for the show just to wait it out that way?

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
No, man.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
See, use XFCE.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
We're telling you to just use it.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
It's good. It's good.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
It's good.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
Yeah, okay.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
Does LXDE do the same thing pretty much?

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
It's a lightweight desktop?

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Oh, here we go.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
I always get this.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Of course.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
I'm not even a believer.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
I think lightweight desktops are bogus to begin with.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
I think the entire thing is bogus.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
How do you like that?

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
It's a bogus idea.

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
It's a concept people use to trick themselves into thinking they're hacking their Linux box to be more efficient.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
It's crap.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
But I compiled it from source, Chris.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
It's junk.

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
I agree with you because then I always hear like, oh, yeah, plasmas bloated.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
This is bloated.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
Like, no, that's not how this works.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
It's garbage.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
It's garbage.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
That's all.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
All right, Monkeycom, you want to jump in.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
Go ahead.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
I haven't used XFCE in so long.

43:52.000 --> 44:02.000
I mean, it was good back in the day, but I want something like KDE or Mate which I can add modern things to and it's just not XFCE.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.000
I tell you what.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
I tell you what.

44:04.000 --> 44:09.000
I understand that you guys out there that are using it, you got your reasons.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
I appreciate that.

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
But I'm looking at this and I'm saying our chat room is pretty much pronouncing it dead.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Our mumble room is – I just – I don't want to believe it.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
They are the definitive source.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
I refuse.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
I refuse to accept it.

44:20.000 --> 44:26.000
I will continue to fight for XFCE for you out there, listener, because I want to be your representation.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
I will fight for you.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
I will fight for you.

44:29.000 --> 44:36.000
A couple of years ago, we had this conversation and I really felt like XFCE was on the way out.

44:36.000 --> 44:45.000
But seeing the amount of effort Simon's putting into projects recently, I think that he's turning the tide and it's got a bright future ahead of it.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
Thank you.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
See Wimpy and me, we'll be here.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
We will – thank you.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
Thank you.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
I agree.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
It was a good blog post.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
And that does add a different spin on it, right?

44:53.000 --> 44:58.000
Like when you don't see updates, when you don't hear about it, that just makes it feel stagnant to you and that kind of goes a long way.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Plus you know what the best thing would be?

45:00.000 --> 45:09.000
The best thing would be that all of a sudden XFCE starts getting updated all the time and then all of these jerks that say they use XFCE because it never gets updated can STF you.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
So I think I am all for it.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
I want to talk about something that I've seen discussed in our subreddit a few times.

45:15.000 --> 45:20.000
And Wimpy, feel free to jump in any time you know something else or have something else to add.

45:20.000 --> 45:31.000
I find this to be a fascinating write-up over on – Wimpy, maybe you could tell me the gentleman's name that's been working on packaging up Snap for all the –

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Zygmunt.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
Oh, okay.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Zygmunt.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
Zygmunt, yeah.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
This is the state of SnapD support across distros.

45:37.000 --> 45:46.000
And he says, first of all, let me preface that SnapD development moves fast. There's a lot of things landing all the time. Many of them are non-trivial, introducing big changes.

45:46.000 --> 45:51.000
A few of those include me in the loop, which significantly cuts out the amount of time I have left to work on.

45:51.000 --> 45:57.000
Ultimately, the whole problem is the problem of having inefficient time to work on everything.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

45:58.000 --> 46:07.000
So he says – he wants to go back. He says, during the SnapD sprint, I started working on distribution packages for Fedora, OpenSUSE, Arch, Gentoo and others.

46:07.000 --> 46:13.000
After a few quick experiments, I was positive that it was doable and probably not that hard.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Boy, was I wrong.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Packaging SnapD is both straightforward and hard.

46:17.000 --> 46:23.000
As a Go project, SnapD builds to a small set of executables and a few supporting system to units.

46:23.000 --> 46:29.000
SnapD has a small brother, SnapConfine, that is written in C and builds anywhere with auto tools.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
So far, so good, right? Well, no.

46:32.000 --> 46:37.000
Fedora 25 requires any service started by SystemD to be confined by SELinux.

46:37.000 --> 46:51.000
Since SnapD itself is not confined, even on Ubuntu, this means that we would build a nice package, but you'd have to disable SELinux, which is not the experience they want their users to have, so the package was never officially released.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
Now, of course, there is some talk about creating an SELinux policy for it.

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
Each Linux distribution has its own set of quirks and nuances.

46:58.000 --> 47:06.000
Software skew aside, the policy is what really differs Debian from Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE or Gentoo.

47:06.000 --> 47:11.000
In one distribution, doing something is frowned upon, while in another, it's perfectly fine or even encouraged.

47:11.000 --> 47:19.000
In fact, he does kind of give us an example about that down here, especially about like where the Snap packages would live.

47:19.000 --> 47:25.000
First, he wanted to create SlashSnap, but the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee said, no, you can't use SlashSnap.

47:25.000 --> 47:32.000
So then after that, he said, okay, that's fine, that's their choice, so I'll move it to var lib SnapD SlashSnap.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
But of course, other distributions don't really care.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
Then there's the whole executable bit.

47:38.000 --> 47:43.000
SnapD relies on a small c executable snap confined that is setuid root.

47:43.000 --> 47:51.000
It needs to be root to perform file system namespace manipulation necessary for the construction of the snap execution environment.

47:51.000 --> 47:58.000
Now, that's all fine and good except for Fedora highly and strongly discourages setuid root executables.

47:58.000 --> 48:03.000
They'll allow it but is not recommended and they'll give you a course talking to.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
So Debian, though, however, exact opposite.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
So Fedora wants you to use extended attributes and these kinds of things.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
But Debian, no extended attributes for you.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
It must be a setuid.

48:15.000 --> 48:20.000
OpenSUSE, to the best of his knowledge, requires that you first get a security review and then get your package

48:20.000 --> 48:25.000
and the exact file name added to a special package called permissions.

48:25.000 --> 48:32.000
For OpenSUSE, the plus S bit can apparently be used or this plus setuid bit sidestepping the permission package,

48:32.000 --> 48:37.000
but it relies on a documented hack that just fools the packaging review tools.

48:37.000 --> 48:42.000
He goes on to basically summarize, snap D is easily to build from source and run in almost any environment

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
with system D and a reason of kernel.

48:45.000 --> 48:49.000
You really should be able to get that going in just a few minutes.

48:49.000 --> 48:56.000
However, packaging that for wider use is a rat's hole of issues and it's not done.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Snappy is a free software project.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
If you'd like to help him out, please reach out to him.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
He's got links in this.

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
There's also the Snappy RC channel and on Rocket Chat.

49:05.000 --> 49:09.000
He says, one day I'll write a book about packaging software for Linux distributions.

49:09.000 --> 49:15.000
I'll start the book with the phrase, this book is already out of date.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
That's a very good summary.

49:16.000 --> 49:22.000
It's interesting how, I mean, Snappy is almost in a second package manager in a sense.

49:22.000 --> 49:28.000
And so it's, I can see where it kind of breaks some of the abstractions or the, you know, be a lot easier like,

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
hey, I just want this game that runs, doesn't need any special permissions.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Can I put it in your repository?

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
Compile's done.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
But when you suddenly need special permissions, when you're managing other apps,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
when you're building your own project, it gets more complicated.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
Wimby, do you, you kind of fly close to the sun on this one.

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
Do you have any things to share from this perspective?

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
Yeah, I read Zygmunt's post last night and there's a couple of things that stand out.

49:48.000 --> 49:56.000
The most interesting to me is when, you know, Linux vendors have been trying to bring,

49:56.000 --> 50:01.000
you know, external people from outside of the Linux world to bring their software to Linux.

50:01.000 --> 50:07.000
If you have to start explaining this stuff to them, that's why their software isn't on Linux.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
I agree.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
Yep.

50:09.000 --> 50:15.000
And it is ironic that Snap, which is designed to solve these problems,

50:15.000 --> 50:19.000
is facing these very same problems in order to solve those problems.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
Is the real problem just a lack of strong distro buy-off?

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
Like if there was passion in the Fedora community, would there maybe?

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
I think somewhere in Zygmunt's post that he said, you know,

50:32.000 --> 50:39.000
the best thing you can have when you're working on this stuff is to actually have somebody

50:39.000 --> 50:45.000
who's got commit rights to the packaging system for the distro who's interested to help you.

50:45.000 --> 50:50.000
You know, if you've got that kind of collaboration, then it makes it easier because they know

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
what some of these nuances are with, you know, the distro that they work on

50:54.000 --> 51:00.000
and what some of the requirements are that maybe somebody coming to it from the outside might not appreciate.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
And I think that's true.

51:01.000 --> 51:07.000
You know, my experience of working in Arch Linux and Debian and Ubuntu is that knowing somebody

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
that can help you is the best way to get stuff done to orientate yourself.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
I agree.

51:12.000 --> 51:19.000
And I wonder if that doesn't mean that Flatpak might have some home turf advantage in that regard.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Well, who can say?

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
Maybe.

51:22.000 --> 51:26.000
I mean, obviously that's being sort of led by Fedora.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
I think it's a Fedora developer primarily that's working on that.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
So, yes, they're going to target their things.

51:33.000 --> 51:41.000
But, you know, the different distributions have chosen different security models and, you know, different policies.

51:41.000 --> 51:47.000
They all grew up at slightly different times and they would have done things in accordance to, you know,

51:47.000 --> 51:52.000
how things were, you know, at that time to some extent and those policies would have shifted over time.

51:52.000 --> 51:57.000
So there are subtle differences, but those subtleties are challenging when you're working at such a low level.

51:57.000 --> 52:02.000
You know where it leaves me wimpy is it leaves me still basically just relying on the AUR.

52:02.000 --> 52:16.000
I've seriously been considering switching to Neon LTS even or potentially we'll see another distribution that I feel like I don't want to list them all again.

52:16.000 --> 52:27.000
But I'm considering in both cases an LTS distribution based on Ubuntu and I just – I think I find myself twice to three times a week

52:27.000 --> 52:34.000
when prepping for the shows or something extremely grateful that I'm able to pull down an application from the AUR and try it really quick.

52:34.000 --> 52:42.000
And I don't know – that's what I would like from a universal packaging standard is that essentially all of the world's best open source

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
is available to me in a standard installable method.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
And I don't feel like we're any closer at all anymore.

52:48.000 --> 52:52.000
We've been watching this now for a while and I feel like both sides have made really good gains but –

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Yeah, there has been progress.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
We have some new frameworks and things that –

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Need killer applications, that's what we need.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
We need killer apps.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
We need killer apps.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
We need really killer – we need like a bunch of them.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
We need a bunch of really good ones.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
I agree.

53:06.000 --> 53:16.000
So looking at Flatpak applications, LibreOffice, Spotify, Monodevelop, Telegram, Skype, Blender, Gnome, Twitch, Gnome MPV.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
I mean there's some good ones on here, Corebird.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
It's kind of the standard list right now.

53:22.000 --> 53:26.000
And I should play around with the Telegram and Skype ones and see how frequently they're updated.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
Yes, those ones stand out to me as –

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
And Spotify.

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
At least especially on the Snap side it seems like the most – like if I can install –

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
Yeah.

53:33.000 --> 53:37.000
Gnome MPV from like a copper or an easy enough other repo.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Yeah.

53:38.000 --> 53:43.000
I really appreciate when I load up a new Ubuntu rig, I really appreciate the Telegram Snap.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
Yes.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
That is really nice.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
I got to play around more with the Flatpak.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
Yeah, go ahead.

53:47.000 --> 53:55.000
So I was going to say last week I think I basically went through all of the applications that I have installed and found –

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
I did a gap analysis to see which ones were available as snaps.

53:59.000 --> 54:06.000
And I've installed the snaps of all of the things where it's available and purged the apt equivalents off my system.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
So how's that going?

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Yes, it's going fine actually.

54:09.000 --> 54:13.000
I was expecting to run into lots of edge cases and things like that.

54:13.000 --> 54:20.000
But I mean there's a couple of little niggles with app indicators that we're working on fixing.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
But by and large it's working very well.

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
Do all the mounted file systems ever bother you?

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
That's something I'm looking at actually.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
Yeah, that's something I'm going to look at, yeah.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
Huh.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
So I wonder how they got a Flatpak of Skype.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
I wonder how they got that.

54:37.000 --> 54:42.000
They pulled down the deb and wrap it and –

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
It's just the Skype alpha.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
So somebody is volunteering to manually re-Flatpak that up.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
I don't think Microsoft Flatpak –

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
It's Alex Larson, the Flatpak developer, is doing that.

54:52.000 --> 54:57.000
Ah, that's a good way to get people using it I suppose.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
I'm going to mess around with all of it.

54:59.000 --> 55:05.000
But this whole universal packaging thing, you know, I'm losing my momentum.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Although I think it's still going to happen.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Gosh, get universal already.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
Get universal already.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
That's all I want.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
Just get it universal already.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
All right, well we've got a lot more to talk about.

55:14.000 --> 55:20.000
In fact, we should probably keep moving because Mr. Wessier is going to be text snapping soon.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
I want to mention Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
Go there and sign up for a free seven-day trial and support the show

55:28.000 --> 55:33.000
and get access to a platform to learn more about Linux, video courses, labs, instructor mentoring,

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
course schedulers, learning paths, practice exams and quizzes,

55:37.000 --> 55:41.000
and note cards forked by the community which is stacked by Jupiter broadcasting members.

55:41.000 --> 55:48.000
But this is big because Linux Academy is always growing, adding new content, making the old stuff even better.

55:48.000 --> 55:53.000
And they just announced a big partnership with Chef to provide high quality in-depth training.

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
You can find out more at linuxacademy.com slash cheftraining

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
and get started on the basic Chef fluency courses.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Hallelujah.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
You can get the basic Chef fluency badge.

56:03.000 --> 56:09.000
They have public profiles and you also get all ready to take certifications too.

56:09.000 --> 56:13.000
We got an email in the Linux Action Show the other day about courses to get into.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
This would be a good one.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
Find out linuxacademy.com slash cheftraining.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
But do me a favor.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
Start at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
That way we get the credit for your visit.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
You can sign up for that free seven-day trial and check it all out.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
And Linux Academy is out on the street if you want to say hi.

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
They're at Developer Week, booth 229.

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
Stop by, shake some hands and say hello.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
Look at that nice looking guy.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
I think I see some swag.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
I think I see swag there, Wes.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
See that's maybe a woman.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
I know.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
And look at the size of that penguin.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Look at the size of that sucker.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
Check them out.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
That's at linuxacademy.com.

56:49.000 --> 56:53.000
Not.com, linuxacademy.com on Twitter if you want to follow their feed.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Or go say hi at Developer Week.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Like I said, it was booth 229.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
And do me a favor and support the show.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
Visit linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

57:02.000 --> 57:08.000
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
So this is a hell of a script.

57:10.000 --> 57:15.000
Takeover.sh, a script to completely take over a running Linux system remotely,

57:15.000 --> 57:20.000
allowing you to log in in a memory rescue environment.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
I don't know why I thought that said recurse.

57:21.000 --> 57:26.000
Unmount the original root file system and do anything you want all without rebooting,

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
because Linux.

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
You can replace it one distro with another without ever having to physically touch a console.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Badass.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
Pretty sweet.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
Pretty badass.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
That's really cool.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
And you see the warning, warning, warning, warning.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
This is experimental.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
Yeah.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Definitely try it out in a VM.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
You know, the first thing I think of is a VPS.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
Yes, right?

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
You just spin it up, throw it away.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
It is neat.

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
It's not a bad read through if you just want to read over the script.

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
In the show notes, I linked a couple other ones that I find a little more readable,

57:58.000 --> 58:01.000
but do the same thing that kind of walk you through to how to turn a Debian into an Arch.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
I bet it's fascinating just to learn how it's doing it.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
Yes.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
And it kind of teaches you a little bit about like what happens in the initramfs.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
How does this kind of work?

58:07.000 --> 58:12.000
So this one's interesting because he makes his own little fake init and kills init.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
You can then kill, unmount the root file system,

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
kill all the old processes that you couldn't kill from your old session.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
Right.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
I've seen other versions and there's some here,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
like one great stack exchange discussion about,

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
hey, can I like reformat or like resize my root partition from...

58:25.000 --> 58:30.000
So you can also say make a little Ubuntu user land with systemd

58:30.000 --> 58:34.000
and then put that in memory and pivot everything with your running kernel there.

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
Wow.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
Yeah.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
That's some cool stuff.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
And then on the other end of the spectrum,

58:40.000 --> 58:46.000
it turns out way back, way back in the day,

58:46.000 --> 58:52.000
Colin Percival created something called the Depenguinator.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
It's a script, and this is his words,

58:55.000 --> 59:02.000
for remotely upgrading a Linux system to FreeBSD.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
They never stopped those guys?

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
No, they just can't help themselves.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
It's great.

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
It's so great.

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
It unfortunately didn't take long for changes in the layout of the FreeBSD releases

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
to make the Depenguination script stop working.

59:13.000 --> 59:17.000
So for the past three years, he's been receiving emails, and he was motivated.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
He wanted the Depenguinator to work with recent FreeBSD releases.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
He got it all set up.

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
But with all things FreeBSD, they slipped behind,

59:25.000 --> 59:30.000
and it only worked on Ubuntu 7.10 for FreeBSD 7.0.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
That's pretty useful.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
Yeah, super useful.

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
You just downgrade from 16 to 7, then switch.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
You're fine.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
It's about as modern as that Linux compatibility layer.

59:38.000 --> 59:45.000
So we all thought, okay, that was cute, but there's just not enough interest to keep this alive.

59:45.000 --> 59:50.000
And so Colin Percival sort of moved on, let it fade away.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
Had to go make tar snap.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
You're a busy guy.

59:52.000 --> 59:57.000
Tar snap needed to be created, and there was really just not a big interest.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Nobody saw it fit to spend their precious time creating Depenguinator 3.0

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
until Alan Jude came along.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Alan Jude forks Depenguinator and creates version 3.0 to override a remote Linux server with FreeBSD.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000
It's new. It's fresh. It's really simple.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
So you swap off. You turn off your swap.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
You DD the swap partition with MFSBSD.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
You then go to your grub menu.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
You fiddle with it to boot from the swap partition.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
You reboot the system from inside MFSBSD.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
You can then SSH into it and reformat everything to FreeBSD.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Do I basically have the process?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Yes, you do.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Damn it, Alan Jude.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And then he says, warning, still contains sharp edges, is not really meant for automated use.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
It's very likely that using this tool without understanding,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
it will leave your server in an unbootable state.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
That is pretty important if you're working with bare metal,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
you don't have a nice HTML5 console, that kind of thing.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Depenguinator.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
So our challenge to you, audience, let's get the reverse.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Let's say I got a FreeBSD droplet.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I'm kind of sick of it. I want the latest Ubuntu.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Right.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Let's get that going.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
That would be good.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
There's not as much of a market need for that because there's not as many VPSs running FreeBSD,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
but we got to fix the ones that are.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
We have to upgrade them to Linux.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
You know what we should do?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Guys, guys, make it, switch it to Arch, right?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
That's great.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Or Gentoo.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Whichever you prefer. Your choice.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000
So let's make, they got Depenguinator, what should we call it?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Repenguinator?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
No, that's not as good.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Something with a GPL.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
That will be good.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Something with Richard Stallman, something with a GPL.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
My little room, you guys have any ideas?

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Stallman strikes back.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
What would you call a script that converts a FreeBSD install,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
wipes it out, and switches it over to Linux?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
So happy hacking.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
The de-demonizer?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
De-demonizer is not bad.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
It's not bad.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
The exorcism.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Beastie Be Gone.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
There we go.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I like that.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Beastie Be Gone or Exorcist.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Yeah, Beastie Be Gone.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I think it's got to be Beastie Be Gone.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Yeah, they're having a bad week.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Wasn't there also a new Beehive project announced

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
that has nothing to do with Beehive Virtualizer?

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Yeah, different spelling, but that's true.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Name collisions there.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And there's a snap for that as well.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Oh, God.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
It's probably going to have more users than Beehive.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I'm sorry.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Beehive is technically very cool, and the guys that work on it,

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I respect them a lot.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I've talked to them, but that's funny,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
because that's going to be a thing.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
So, yeah.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Yeah.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
De-demonizer or something with exorcism would be good.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
And I say Archer Gentoo would be preferred.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
If you can make it, we'll run it next week.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
You know, you could even put Debian Stable.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
It'd still be more up-to-date and modern than FreeBSD.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Oh!

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I'm just trolling at this point.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Just trolling.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
So, you heard us mention at DigitalOcean.com,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
go over there and create a droplet.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
This is a great way to get set up with their awesome,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
powerful infrastructure.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
It's one word.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
You apply it to your account, you get a $10 credit.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
DigitalOcean is incredibly fast, incredibly easy to use,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
and there's incredible prices.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Woo!

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Woo!

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Just kind of lost it for a second because I'm so excited.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
I'm so excited.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
You know why I'm super excited?

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
You have a problem.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
What's that?

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
You have too much excitement.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
What are you going to do with it?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
How are you going to handle that?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I'm going to load balance it, Wes.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
I'm going to load balance it.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Brand new DigitalOcean feature launched today.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Scale your applications and improve availability

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
across your infrastructure in just a few clicks.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Don't look at it.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Go use it now.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Don't walk.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Run to DigitalOcean and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
It's simple to set up.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
You can easily manage the load balancers

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
through DigitalOcean's API or control panel.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
I got good ones at that.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
You can scale your traffic capacity.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I was just talking to the beard earlier today.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
We've been having some Libsyn problems.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
See, the thing about Libsyn is we've been a customer now

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
for like as long as Libsyn has been a company,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
and they have just gone through some bad changes,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
and they shut down one of our accounts

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
because they don't offer that plan anymore.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Oh, no.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
You know what my first thought was?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Let's go spin up three droplets.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
They have data centers all over the world,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
so we'll do them in West Coast, East Coast, and in Germany.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Use the load balancer.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Easy-peasy.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
There's our new MP3 distribution system.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Set it up in just minutes.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
DigitalOcean.com.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
There's lots of reasons to try it,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
from simple infrastructure

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
to long-term deployment and projects.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
We run lots of our backend pieces now on DigitalOcean.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
My backend is all up in DigitalOcean.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Yours can be, too.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED to get started.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Get a $10 credit and try them out.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Support the show, too.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
DOUNPLUGGED.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Thanks, DigitalOcean, for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
All right, Wes, you crazy SOB.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
You had a weekend with WireGuard.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Actually, I don't know how long you had time with WireGuard,

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
but I know that you got a little WireGuard time in.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Now, break it down for me.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Break it down because I know we've talked about it before,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
but it sounds like you really kind of got inspired

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
after watching this FOSDEM discussion on it,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
or listening to it, I guess.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Yeah, there's a MP4 and WebM, I think, if that's your style.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000
So, yeah, Jason, the author, gave a talk at FOSDEM.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
It's a good talk.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
He talks fast, goes through a lot, but it's not that complicated.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
And he has a really short demo,

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
which is also linked on that same page that you can watch

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
where he just kind of shows it off in the terminal.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
And it's so easy to get started.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
That's kind of what appealed to me.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
So, on the site they kind of go through,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
and in the presentation they go through, it's a new VPN.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
It's opinionated, so it's layer 3 only, right?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
So you're not doing your broadcast domains, Ethernet stuff.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Uses the noise protocol framework.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Uses the noise protocol.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
So it makes some choices.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It doesn't have cipher agility,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
so they have a set list of secure ciphers that are secure right now.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
So you don't even have the option to use a secure one.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
And it's very minimal.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Like, here's the size of the open VPN code base.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Here's the size of strong SWAN.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Sure, because he's probably heavily relying on the kernel module

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
to do the heavy lifting, right?

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Or is he including that?

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Uses a fair bit, and then his new stuff to be added

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
is a little over 3,000 lines of C.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
So it hasn't been audited yet.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
We don't know. It's not even upstreamed yet.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
He's working on a 1.0 version,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000
kind of finalizing some of the protocols and formats.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
And then he's going to submit it for inclusion to the kernel.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
But it's really simple, and it works.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
It uses the interface as its native,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
kind of its base building block.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.000
So you do IP link add WG0 type WireGuard.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Now you have a new interface.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Then you assign it an IP address.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Right now, there is a third party,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
or he wrote a WireGuard utility

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
that basically configures it with the keys that it needs

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
and the peers it can allow.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
You do that, and IP link set WG0 up

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
on your two hosts or whatever.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
So I'm VPNed right now to a droplet.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Oh, really?

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
So one of the nice advantages it has is the way it works.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
It's kind of like the MOSH utility.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Oh, really?

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
So you set the endpoint IP for your droplet.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Yeah.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I have my whole...

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Actually, right now I'm connected to the IRC.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I'm connected to everything through the WireGuard tunnel

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
on my laptop.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
It was working at home.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I suspended, turned it back on.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
It just works.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
So you have it right on the droplet,

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
and that IP stays the same.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
And your laptop IP changes,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
and when you wake from sleep on a new Wi-Fi network...

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Yeah.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
And so he goes into it more in the presentation,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
but it has a very short handshake

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
so it can start up again, and it's very quiet.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
By default, it doesn't do a lot of keep-alives or anything.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
It does have some options for better NAT punching

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
and that sort of thing.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
So there are a lot of caveats.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
It's not open VPN.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
It doesn't come with a whole bunch of stuff.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
It's really meant to be a secure...

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Just a secure, minimal base framework

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
that you can build on top of.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
WireGuard securely encapsulates IP packets over UDP.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Can you tell this is like the third show I've done

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
that my tongue is giving up?

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
It's done.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
You add a WireGuard interface,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
configure it with your private key and your peers' public keys,

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
and then you send packets across it.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
All issues of the key distribution

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
and pushed configurations are out of scope of WireGuard.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
That's what I mean.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
These are issues much better left for other layers,

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
which really you can solve those problems

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
in ways that work better for you.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
So for somebody like yourself,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
that might actually be kind of a preferred thing.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Yep.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I'm already thinking of using it.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I like Tink.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I use Tink, right?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
So this does not necessarily replace Tink.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
You could do a lot of the same things.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Where would you use it in place of?

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
It's not as good for a complete...

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
It wouldn't work in as a complete mesh necessarily

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
or as a little less.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Sure, sure.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
But you could do like an IPsec style star configuration

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
or other still similar to mesh,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
especially in an environment where it's less dynamic

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
or where you have like configuration management

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
or other systems where basically all the peers

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
need to talk to you,

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
they need to know about the peers

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
and have the public keys

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
or the peers they want to talk to you.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
But I do something where I have some family and friends

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
who have VPN tunnels to my network.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
I'm already thinking about placing Tink with this.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Really?

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Because it just stays in place.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
And eventually I'm hoping it'll be in the kernel,

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
so it'll be really easy as a dependency as well.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Yeah, he's upstreamed everything.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Well, it's not in the kernel yet,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
but it's planning to be.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Oh.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
So he started our discussion

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
with the network maintainers already.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
He gave this talk.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
He has a white paper.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
And so at some point in this year,

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
we expect to see it submitted for a formal review on the mailing list.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
So it could be a little while.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Yeah.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
But it's super easy.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
It's already packaged.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
So there's a copper repo.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
There's a PPA.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
In Arch, it's already there.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
And you can just install it as a DKMS module.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
It builds really easy.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
It takes like two minutes.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Yeah.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
And then you don't have to worry about it.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Yeah.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
So once you have it all set up,

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000
your connection process is you just activate the interface

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
once everything's configured.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Yep.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
You just turn on the interface.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
There's also a couple scripts that he wrote.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
So there's, again, it's meant as a lower level building block,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
but it comes with a WG Quick script

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
where it has a little kind of like a system D style

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
INI configuration file.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
And then there you can set up a little more

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
so the script will also set your IPs and stuff.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
So you can pretty much do WG Quick up, WG Quick down.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
And then that will up and down your interface.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
And that's a little script that takes care

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000
of all the other little nimbly's in the background.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Yeah.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000
But I had already set that up before.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
And so all I did when I got here,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
I'm pinging it right now, like 10 millisecond ping

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
up to the San Fran droplet.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Really not bad.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
I just did IP link set interface up,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
and then it immediately does the handshake

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
to get everything going again, and it just works.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
That's slick.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000
WireGuard, WireGuard.io if you want to check it out.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Oh, I should mention there, IRC, thank you.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
They're already working.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
There's some PRs already for system D network D,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
which I think would be great.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000
We need simple server configured VPNs and a network manager.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Yeah.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
And then you combine that with eventually getting the kernel.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Yeah.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Magic.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
It sounds pretty sweet.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000
That'd be really nice.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Well, cool.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Very cool, Wes.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
I'm glad you were able to try it out.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Because I remember us talking about it,

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
and it seemed pretty exciting.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
I'm a little bummed.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I was hoping the kernel module would be further along

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
to being upstream because the reality is you can submit things all day long.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Yes, we don't know.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
There's no guarantees it will be approved,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
nothing like that at all.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Yeah.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
But that has been some positive reviews.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
That's how it works though, right?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
That's how it goes.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
The system D people seem to like it.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
So if that's a sign for or against, I really don't know.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
But it's something.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000
All right.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I don't know what to make of that.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
That means it's probably going to be controversial.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Damn it.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Leonard, we love you though, really.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
We love you, baby.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Happy Valentine's Day.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
All right.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
That brings us to the end of this week's broadcast.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
184 has got to get out of here so we can make room for 185

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
and the TechSnap show.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Now, I encourage you to visit our live stream at jblive.tv.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
But Chris, but Chris, when do I go?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Such a great question.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Such.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Feedback at linuxaction.reddit.com.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Follow Wes on the Twitter.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
You're at Wes Payne, right?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
That's right.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I'm at Chris LAS.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Thank you for joining us.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:12:14.000
See you right back here next Tuesday.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Thank you, Mumble Room.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
I love your faces.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Thank you, Chat Room.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Let's go get our title, and then we got to scoot.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Wow, look at us though.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I think we're going to get well.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Oh, I see what happened.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.000
This clock over here says 326, and this clock over here says 329.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
We're not actually doing as well as I thought we were, but that's okay.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
For exception, that's kind of funny.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
XFC evangelism.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
That's pretty good, Wes.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Internet Walmart.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Yeah, that would be our first story.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Amazon chimes in.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Nice.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Nice.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
And Al and the Penguin Slayer.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
How about that de-Penguify?

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
I know, right?

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
It's a funny story.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I do think there's some things in that script we talked about.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Oh, Mumble's muted.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Sorry, Mumble.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I had you muted.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I love you anyways.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Go ahead if you were talking.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Sorry, guys.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
I had you muted during the music, and I forgot to unmute you.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I'm kind of sad Woolly wasn't able to stick around for WireGuard.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I know.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I know.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I know.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I know.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
So Wimpy, will we see you?

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Probably not next week.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Probably nay on the Wimpy.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Don't know at this point.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Yeah, it was nice to have you.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
It was nice to have you.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000
It was nice to have you.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Yeah.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Yeah.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
And thank you for bringing that story up, because that was an interesting discussion,

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
too.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Yeah.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Yeah, I was a bit surprised by it, so I wondered how many people it had passed by.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000
It's funny that I saw it, and for some reason it didn't land with me.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
That's not an entire new desktop environment.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
It didn't land for some reason.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000
I was just like, okay, well, I got to move on, but something about that's odd, and that

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
was pretty much all I thought.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Chilling with Kylan.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Chilling.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Yes, I was about to suggest that, and then I saw WW had already put it there and started

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
up.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
That's pretty good.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Will people know what the hell we're talking about?

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Okay, I say it's chilling with Chilling versus Forkception right now.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000
What do you like better, Wes?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Ooh.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
You like chilling with Chilling better?

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I really do like it.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
There's a little bit less of that front end.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Once someone's seen the title and listened to the episode, they'll like it, right?

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
It's a good title.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Yes.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
But it has a little less of the draw angle.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
I see that.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Yeah.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Forkception is...

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Yeah.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
But then again, maybe that's not what we should be letting drive our title choices.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Right.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
What's the main goal of the title?

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I mean, I used to think it was to get people to watch and listen, but now I'm thinking

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000
it's to just please the people already listening, because with a podcast, it's a long show.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
It's not like you're just getting a lot of drive-bys.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
You've got to slowly just accrue your listener base.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.000
You've got to convince them to listen every time, or at least most of the time.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Talking about slowly accruing your listener base, can I make a small plug?

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Yes.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
In fact, do while we're still recording, because I...

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Go ahead.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Yes.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.000
So those of you that listen to the Ubuntu podcast will know that we're on a season break

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.000
at the moment, and we always have a planning meeting after a few months to see if we're

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
going to come back for another season, and we did that last week, and we're going to

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000
come back for season 10, and we'll be putting out a teaser episode soon.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:23.000
So if you want to hear more opinion from myself or Alan or Mark, then head over to UbuntuPodcast.org

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:36.000
and get subscribed.
