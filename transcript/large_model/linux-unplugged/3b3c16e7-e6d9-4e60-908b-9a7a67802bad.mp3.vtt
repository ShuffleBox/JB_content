WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.120
I was thinking about dropping the coming up

00:02.120 --> 00:03.260
on this week's episode of Unplugged.

00:03.260 --> 00:04.100
You know, I always like,

00:04.100 --> 00:05.740
coming up on this week's episode of Unplugged.

00:05.740 --> 00:06.580
The little pre-tease.

00:06.580 --> 00:07.540
It just feels old.

00:07.540 --> 00:09.540
You know, now that we got chapter markers and stuff,

00:09.540 --> 00:10.820
like, I don't need to tell you what's coming up.

00:10.820 --> 00:12.180
It's all right there.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.020
Yeah.

00:13.020 --> 00:15.180
You know, we now live in a post-chapter marker reality.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.260
So I think I'm gonna drop it.

00:16.260 --> 00:17.380
We'll see how it goes.

00:18.580 --> 00:23.580
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 297 for April 16th, 2019.

00:23.580 --> 00:28.580
Welcome into Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

00:36.960 --> 00:39.880
that's gearing up for the big Ubuntu 19.04 release.

00:39.880 --> 00:40.720
My name is Chris.

00:40.720 --> 00:41.560
My name is Wes.

00:41.560 --> 00:43.000
Hello, Wes.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.820
So I'm not doing the whole coming up this week thing.

00:44.820 --> 00:45.660
I'm not doing it anymore.

00:45.660 --> 00:46.500
We're skipping it.

00:46.500 --> 00:47.320
We're not skipping it anymore.

00:47.320 --> 00:49.100
We're gonna get right into the content.

00:49.100 --> 00:50.900
So to achieve that mission,

00:50.900 --> 00:52.060
let's bring in our virtual lug.

00:52.060 --> 00:53.700
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

00:53.700 --> 00:54.540
Hello.

00:54.540 --> 00:55.380
Hello.

00:55.380 --> 00:56.200
Hello.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.040
Hello.

00:57.040 --> 00:57.880
Hello.

00:57.880 --> 00:58.700
You want a lovely bunch.

00:58.700 --> 00:59.540
Look at that.

00:59.540 --> 01:00.360
Look at that over there.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.200
We got Brent.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.040
We got Elle.

01:02.040 --> 01:04.260
We got Mimidus, Mini-Meg.

01:04.260 --> 01:06.400
We got Neon Burner, which looks like Neon Burger

01:06.400 --> 01:07.620
from where I'm at.

01:07.620 --> 01:11.180
M. Mason's in there, Tech Mav, the project manager.

01:11.180 --> 01:14.740
Turth and Wimpy in there, all repping our virtual lug.

01:14.740 --> 01:17.740
And of course, joining us on a direct studio line

01:17.740 --> 01:19.260
is the one, the only, Mr. Bacon.

01:19.260 --> 01:20.080
Hello, cheese.

01:20.080 --> 01:20.920
Hey, guys.

01:20.920 --> 01:21.760
How's it going?

01:21.760 --> 01:22.600
Everybody?

01:22.600 --> 01:23.420
Everybody?

01:23.420 --> 01:24.260
Pretty good.

01:24.260 --> 01:26.620
I'm pretty excited today about Ubuntu 19.04.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.940
Wes and I have been running it for quite a while

01:28.940 --> 01:31.180
and have many thoughts to share.

01:31.180 --> 01:32.880
And I have arrived somewhere

01:32.880 --> 01:35.520
that I don't think any of you will expect.

01:35.520 --> 01:36.600
I'm just gonna put it like that.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.440
We'll just, we'll get there.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.180
But what do you say we start with some community news?

01:39.180 --> 01:40.020
We've got to.

01:40.020 --> 01:41.220
We've got to, Wes,

01:41.220 --> 01:43.460
because that's what we have lined up so far.

01:43.460 --> 01:45.420
I thought maybe we'd do a couple like quick

01:45.420 --> 01:48.160
like service announcements and then get in.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.580
Normally we've been starting with birthdays,

01:49.580 --> 01:52.180
but we're had a birthday, unless we missed one.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.020
Did we miss one?

01:53.020 --> 01:53.860
Raise your hand if so.

01:53.860 --> 01:56.540
Is it, it's not anybody's birthday

01:56.540 --> 01:57.820
in the mumble room, right?

01:57.820 --> 01:59.580
Happy birthday again, Wes.

01:59.580 --> 02:00.420
Yeah.

02:00.420 --> 02:01.620
Thank you.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.180
Yeah, there we go.

02:03.180 --> 02:05.460
No, let's start with just a couple of bits of like,

02:05.460 --> 02:06.580
this is gonna matter,

02:06.580 --> 02:10.500
but not a lot of conversation needs to be had.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.020
First up is Red Hat is announcing changes

02:13.020 --> 02:14.920
to their certified engineer program.

02:14.920 --> 02:17.240
Currently the RHCE is a Red Hat certified

02:17.240 --> 02:19.660
system administrator, R-H-C-S-A,

02:19.660 --> 02:21.460
geez, I have these acronyms.

02:21.460 --> 02:23.340
This, Elle could explain this better than I could,

02:23.340 --> 02:24.940
who possess additional skills, knowledge,

02:24.940 --> 02:27.100
and abilities required in data center services.

02:27.100 --> 02:28.340
In the updated program,

02:28.340 --> 02:32.280
we are shifting the focus to automation of Linux systems,

02:32.280 --> 02:35.900
like administration tasks using Red Hat Ansible Automation,

02:35.900 --> 02:37.540
and we'll be changing the requirements

02:37.540 --> 02:40.180
for achieving an RHCE credential.

02:40.180 --> 02:41.020
Yeah, all right.

02:41.020 --> 02:43.840
So in the next set of this stuff,

02:43.840 --> 02:46.760
there's gonna be a new course and then a new exam.

02:46.760 --> 02:50.940
So Red Hat System Administration 3, Linux Automation,

02:50.940 --> 02:53.100
which is basically designed for Linux system administrators

02:53.100 --> 02:55.300
and developers who need to automate provisioning,

02:55.300 --> 02:58.300
configuration, application deployment, and orchestration.

02:58.300 --> 03:01.540
Basically, you learn how to use Ansible.

03:01.540 --> 03:02.580
It makes a lot of sense, right?

03:02.580 --> 03:05.420
In the age of the cloud, in the age of automation,

03:05.420 --> 03:07.300
data center knowledge is important,

03:07.300 --> 03:10.260
but this seems to have maybe a wider scope.

03:10.260 --> 03:12.260
To me, it feels like what Red Hat is saying here

03:12.260 --> 03:14.660
is having a comprehensive understanding

03:14.660 --> 03:17.260
of the automation tools is just as important

03:17.260 --> 03:18.900
as having a comprehensive understanding

03:18.900 --> 03:20.220
of the operating system.

03:20.220 --> 03:21.180
That's the implicit statement.

03:21.180 --> 03:23.220
That's a big statement.

03:23.220 --> 03:24.060
It's true.

03:24.060 --> 03:25.660
I mean, I think the market feels that way,

03:25.660 --> 03:27.540
but it's Red Hat kind of updating

03:27.540 --> 03:30.140
their really well-known industry programs to reflect that.

03:30.140 --> 03:32.140
Yeah, well, I mean, you just have a lot of systems

03:32.140 --> 03:33.860
that you probably have to take care of, right?

03:33.860 --> 03:36.620
It's not about one Linux server or two in an HA pair.

03:36.620 --> 03:38.460
It's about all the ones that you have

03:38.460 --> 03:40.940
in various data centers and cloud programs.

03:40.940 --> 03:44.140
While we're talking about big corporations using Linux,

03:44.140 --> 03:45.420
this is kind of an interesting one

03:45.420 --> 03:48.220
that folks have noticed on the Google I.O. schedule.

03:48.220 --> 03:53.220
There is a Linux for Chromebooks secure development track.

03:53.220 --> 03:56.460
Learn how Chrome OS gives you a secure, safe sandbox

03:56.460 --> 03:58.300
for the web, Android, and Linux

03:58.300 --> 04:00.500
through Chrome OS design principles.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.860
Yeah, that's right.

04:01.860 --> 04:05.180
Ah, ha-ha, this session will also cover ways

04:05.180 --> 04:07.100
to handle challenges to high performance

04:07.100 --> 04:09.580
and trade-offs with safety.

04:09.580 --> 04:11.500
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

04:11.500 --> 04:12.940
Well, that's something to watch.

04:12.940 --> 04:14.660
So they're really going all in to position this thing

04:14.660 --> 04:15.900
as a development platform.

04:15.900 --> 04:17.500
I mean, they've slowly been piecing it together, right?

04:17.500 --> 04:20.140
Every week, it seems like one little new piece

04:20.140 --> 04:22.380
is added to Chromebook Linux app support.

04:22.380 --> 04:23.780
Winby, I don't think I've heard your thoughts

04:23.780 --> 04:26.500
on Google's moves here to clearly turn this thing

04:26.500 --> 04:29.920
into kind of a Sputnik competitor.

04:31.060 --> 04:34.940
Probably, I mean, yes, why not?

04:34.940 --> 04:38.860
I mean, we saw from the OpenStack developer survey

04:38.860 --> 04:42.700
that came out last week that there is 20-odd percent

04:42.700 --> 04:45.220
of developers using Linux,

04:45.220 --> 04:48.620
so wherever you can provide Linux to developers

04:48.620 --> 04:51.660
is obviously going to be popular with developers, I think.

04:51.660 --> 04:53.500
This is maybe my normal default reaction

04:53.500 --> 04:54.500
for Google stuff like this,

04:54.500 --> 04:56.220
but I am sitting a bit uneasy

04:56.220 --> 04:57.700
after our conversation last week

04:57.700 --> 05:00.060
about what makes desktop Linux, really.

05:00.060 --> 05:00.900
Yep.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.540
I'm less enthusiastic about this.

05:02.540 --> 05:05.380
Yeah, I'm conflicted on this.

05:05.380 --> 05:08.740
So we obviously had that conversation last week,

05:08.740 --> 05:13.740
and there's a class of Linux devices

05:14.500 --> 05:17.420
where you don't want to be able to do

05:17.420 --> 05:19.060
all of those things that we described,

05:19.060 --> 05:21.980
which is you express the ultimate flexibility

05:21.980 --> 05:24.340
of the Linux desktop by being able to download,

05:24.340 --> 05:28.620
compile, and boot off the kernel that you've just compiled.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.220
That defines the true heritage

05:31.220 --> 05:33.460
of Linux distributions in my mind.

05:33.460 --> 05:36.780
However, if you're building IoT devices, for example,

05:36.780 --> 05:39.020
you don't want to expose that kind of flexibility

05:39.020 --> 05:40.460
to the device manufacturer, right?

05:40.460 --> 05:42.380
You want to lock that stuff down and provide them

05:42.380 --> 05:47.060
with a secure, updated environment.

05:47.060 --> 05:48.900
And there's an argument to be made

05:48.900 --> 05:51.340
for having a desktop environment

05:51.340 --> 05:52.660
that kind of mimics that as well.

05:52.660 --> 05:53.700
If you're only ever going

05:53.700 --> 05:55.540
to be developing Android applications,

05:55.540 --> 05:57.220
do you need all of the flexibility

05:57.220 --> 05:59.020
that we see as an advantage?

05:59.020 --> 06:00.620
Do you just need the ability

06:00.620 --> 06:03.100
to install the development tools that you need

06:03.100 --> 06:04.740
to create the development environment

06:04.740 --> 06:06.660
that you need to get your job done

06:06.660 --> 06:08.540
and then to go about the business

06:08.540 --> 06:11.380
of creating Android apps or whatever it might be?

06:11.380 --> 06:13.940
Does that type of developer actually need

06:13.940 --> 06:17.500
all of the flexibility that we hold so dear?

06:17.500 --> 06:18.660
Right, I mean, the same stuff when we talk

06:18.660 --> 06:20.660
about the Windows subsystem for Linux, right?

06:20.660 --> 06:22.540
And I think already too many developers,

06:22.540 --> 06:25.020
Linux is a tool that you run on your servers, right?

06:25.020 --> 06:26.140
You kind of view it as an environment

06:26.140 --> 06:27.940
that I make for my application,

06:27.940 --> 06:30.460
especially if it's going to be in some sort of container

06:30.460 --> 06:31.940
or virtual machine.

06:31.940 --> 06:34.460
So it's not necessarily the thing you play with

06:34.460 --> 06:35.860
or are embedded in.

06:35.860 --> 06:37.140
Yeah, so I'm being a little bit

06:37.140 --> 06:38.460
of devil's advocate this week.

06:38.460 --> 06:40.220
I'm playing the counter position.

06:40.220 --> 06:42.060
The other thing is maybe it's just easy, right?

06:42.060 --> 06:43.380
And then they're like, oh, this Linux stuff's

06:43.380 --> 06:45.620
pretty handy and I like how it can do more stuff

06:45.620 --> 06:47.380
than it can do in the outside application.

06:47.380 --> 06:48.380
Maybe I should explore,

06:48.380 --> 06:51.020
but that's going to be a tiny percentage realistically.

06:51.020 --> 06:52.820
Once again, RMS was right.

06:52.820 --> 06:55.540
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.660
He just deploys it as a container and good to go.

06:58.660 --> 07:03.020
So there is some buzz around video

07:03.020 --> 07:06.580
that the Linux, the Linux, oh my God, I'm that guy.

07:06.580 --> 07:08.340
Oh my God, I'm that guy.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.940
The Linus Link.

07:09.940 --> 07:12.380
Juniper Broadcasting, is that it again?

07:12.380 --> 07:13.420
I never really said it out loud.

07:13.420 --> 07:15.540
The Linus Link Tech Show, is that what it's called?

07:15.540 --> 07:17.260
Linus Link Tech Tips, that's what it is.

07:17.260 --> 07:18.500
Linus Tech Tips.

07:18.500 --> 07:19.340
Okay, okay.

07:19.340 --> 07:20.180
LTT.

07:20.180 --> 07:23.540
Yeah, and I do actually watch from time to time.

07:23.540 --> 07:24.380
I don't know why I just,

07:24.380 --> 07:26.340
I guess I've never had to say it out loud before.

07:26.340 --> 07:28.340
There's a lot of buzz though around a video

07:28.340 --> 07:30.820
that they did recently around gaming on Linux.

07:30.820 --> 07:35.220
The title of the video is Microsoft should be very afraid.

07:35.220 --> 07:37.660
A noob's guide to installing Linux gaming.

07:37.660 --> 07:39.660
It's actually a pretty well done video,

07:39.660 --> 07:41.580
which is a nice change of pace in general

07:41.580 --> 07:43.260
for this kind of stuff.

07:43.260 --> 07:45.620
But they really made a pretty good sales pitch

07:45.620 --> 07:48.820
for both Manjaro and Pop!OS in there.

07:48.820 --> 07:52.300
But I would say they really kind of sealed the deal

07:52.300 --> 07:54.580
right here towards the end of the video.

07:54.580 --> 07:55.940
For Pop!OS and Manjaro,

07:55.940 --> 07:57.700
and actually for a number of other distros

07:57.700 --> 07:59.220
we didn't cover today,

07:59.220 --> 08:01.940
the steps basically boil down to install the OS,

08:01.940 --> 08:04.260
install Steam or Lutris, and start playing.

08:04.260 --> 08:05.300
That's what makes these distros

08:05.300 --> 08:07.180
especially enticing for gamers.

08:07.180 --> 08:09.500
But while Manjaro is set up well

08:09.500 --> 08:11.340
to cater to gamers out of the box,

08:11.340 --> 08:14.060
it's not going to be as stable as a distro like Ubuntu.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.320
And that's why Pop!OS and others like it

08:16.320 --> 08:18.500
try to bridge that gap with updated drivers

08:18.500 --> 08:20.480
while still retaining excellent community support

08:20.480 --> 08:21.800
and stable packages,

08:21.800 --> 08:24.180
which makes them a good choice for getting your feet wet.

08:24.180 --> 08:26.820
So Emma, I'm curious what System76

08:26.820 --> 08:28.660
has seen as response to this video.

08:28.660 --> 08:32.560
So we've had thousands of gigabytes of data downloaded.

08:32.560 --> 08:36.500
We had, since then we've had 18,000,

08:36.500 --> 08:39.620
almost 18,000 downloads of Pop!OS.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.020
It's very exciting.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.020
Are you seeing higher than average,

08:43.020 --> 08:44.680
like people sticking around now

08:44.680 --> 08:46.420
that the video has been out for a little bit?

08:46.420 --> 08:48.560
Like are the downloads still remaining high?

08:48.560 --> 08:51.500
Yes, we're seeing about 2,000 per day.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.420
The first day was about 5,000,

08:54.420 --> 08:57.740
and each day after has been 2,000 or more.

08:57.740 --> 08:59.420
So.

08:59.420 --> 09:01.900
Wow, congratulations.

09:01.900 --> 09:03.740
That is an achievement right there.

09:03.740 --> 09:05.580
That is fantastic.

09:05.580 --> 09:09.060
And I think, you know,

09:09.060 --> 09:10.580
overall, the last few months,

09:10.580 --> 09:13.100
I've seen more and more people talking about Pop!OS,

09:13.100 --> 09:14.660
using Pop!OS.

09:14.660 --> 09:16.580
It's becoming more and more

09:16.580 --> 09:18.300
of a well-established distribution.

09:18.300 --> 09:19.300
Well, thank you.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.540
You are almost enticing me, I have to admit.

09:21.540 --> 09:23.540
Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, there's a lot of effort

09:23.540 --> 09:25.060
that's been put in there to tune some things,

09:25.060 --> 09:26.580
and I think people are talking about that,

09:26.580 --> 09:27.820
and other people are picking it up,

09:27.820 --> 09:28.820
and be like, oh, I want that.

09:28.820 --> 09:30.460
Why doesn't my computer do it already?

09:30.460 --> 09:31.860
Yeah, and I've heard rumors

09:31.860 --> 09:33.140
that there'll be a new installer,

09:33.140 --> 09:35.620
that the new installer will support CFS soon,

09:35.620 --> 09:36.500
and things like that.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.580
So there's other advantages

09:38.580 --> 09:39.780
that start to make it appealing,

09:39.780 --> 09:41.720
besides just a few other things,

09:41.720 --> 09:42.860
like maybe a new theme,

09:42.860 --> 09:44.440
or a different way to encrypt the hard drive.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.980
But there's other things that have been coming along

09:46.980 --> 09:49.100
that really seem like a pretty good innovation.

09:49.100 --> 09:50.540
Or at least a nice value add,

09:50.540 --> 09:52.460
in a case like this, easy access to Steam,

09:52.460 --> 09:55.020
and what not, that got the attention

09:55.020 --> 09:57.420
of the folks over at Linus Tech Tips,

09:57.420 --> 09:58.260
and I got it.

09:58.260 --> 09:59.080
Good job.

09:59.080 --> 09:59.920
Thank you.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.860
And I just, I'm really happy to hear

10:01.860 --> 10:04.940
that you guys have gotten some traffic from it,

10:04.940 --> 10:07.440
and I'd be curious to know

10:07.440 --> 10:08.980
what the Manjaro project has seen,

10:08.980 --> 10:11.860
because the Manjaro got a fair amount of mentions.

10:11.860 --> 10:13.380
They lean Pop OS, though, towards the end,

10:13.380 --> 10:14.700
and I think for good reason,

10:14.700 --> 10:15.820
especially for the type of user.

10:15.820 --> 10:17.000
Yeah, for the video that this,

10:17.000 --> 10:18.080
and the audience they're aiming for,

10:18.080 --> 10:19.620
that's probably the best advice.

10:19.620 --> 10:23.100
But the title, Microsoft should be very worried,

10:23.100 --> 10:25.620
all uppercase, very, very worried.

10:25.620 --> 10:26.940
That's pretty good.

10:26.940 --> 10:27.780
That's pretty good.

10:27.780 --> 10:28.600
Pretty, pretty good.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.960
So that's cool to hear, Emma.

10:29.960 --> 10:30.800
That's really cool to hear

10:30.800 --> 10:32.100
that you got some downloads from it.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.860
Hello, Mr. Popey, I see you sneaking in there

10:33.860 --> 10:34.700
under the wire.

10:34.700 --> 10:35.780
Oh, hello.

10:35.780 --> 10:37.580
How are you doing, sir?

10:37.580 --> 10:38.420
I'm good, thank you.

10:38.420 --> 10:39.620
It's like when you sneak into class,

10:39.620 --> 10:42.400
and then the teacher calls you out for sneaking in.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.620
I saw you see me out the corner of your eye, but yeah.

10:45.620 --> 10:46.700
I know you were just getting back

10:46.700 --> 10:48.540
from the DevWan conference,

10:48.540 --> 10:51.260
and so I just wanted to get your report

10:51.260 --> 10:54.440
at the first ever DevWan conference, and how it went.

10:55.900 --> 10:56.740
Wait, what?

10:56.740 --> 10:59.660
Oh, I thought you'd just go with it.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.620
Oh man, I actually feel a little bad

11:03.620 --> 11:05.740
about giving these guys such a hard time.

11:05.740 --> 11:07.660
At least I did until I read this blog post.

11:07.660 --> 11:09.240
But before I read this blog post,

11:09.240 --> 11:11.780
I was starting to feel like maybe I should go easy.

11:11.780 --> 11:13.860
Like they've actually got some genuine.

11:14.940 --> 11:15.940
I mean, it's not like it's a problem.

11:15.940 --> 11:17.220
They're not hurting anyone by.

11:17.220 --> 11:18.500
And they're finding a market.

11:18.500 --> 11:19.340
And they're, you know.

11:19.340 --> 11:20.880
If there are users and people who are happy to develop

11:20.880 --> 11:21.980
and use the operating system,

11:21.980 --> 11:24.140
then all the better for them to do so.

11:24.140 --> 11:26.060
It starts out, the blog post starts out pretty good.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.940
It starts, the conference took place in Amsterdam

11:28.940 --> 11:30.340
in one of the rooms of a building

11:30.340 --> 11:31.940
that is floating on the water,

11:31.940 --> 11:34.780
and looks a lot like an anchored submarine.

11:34.780 --> 11:36.700
This white submarine gives us home

11:36.700 --> 11:39.580
to offices of dyne.org, D-Y-N-E.org,

11:39.580 --> 11:41.900
a nonprofit foundation dedicated to free software,

11:41.900 --> 11:44.020
art, and sustainability.

11:44.020 --> 11:46.380
All right, okay, they got some pictures of food.

11:46.380 --> 11:47.800
They say each day was filled

11:47.800 --> 11:49.380
with lots of interesting speakers

11:49.380 --> 11:51.340
and intermittent hack sessions

11:51.340 --> 11:53.880
where participants got the chance to exchange ideas,

11:53.880 --> 11:55.740
share knowledge, and plan future steps

11:55.740 --> 11:58.700
regarding their role in the open source community.

11:59.820 --> 12:03.180
But things kind of take a turn to the left

12:03.180 --> 12:04.540
or to the right, however you, I don't know.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.580
They just take a turn for the worse.

12:06.580 --> 12:08.380
They go down a different route, Wes.

12:09.260 --> 12:11.140
It starts around here.

12:11.140 --> 12:13.540
There was an omnipresent feeling

12:13.540 --> 12:15.280
that the people attending the conference

12:15.280 --> 12:19.860
were superheroes finally being able to put on their suits.

12:19.860 --> 12:23.260
That's one of many things that are in this post

12:23.260 --> 12:25.220
that are very, very hyperbolic.

12:25.220 --> 12:27.100
Now, I get what they're going for.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.180
I get what they're going for,

12:28.180 --> 12:30.740
but it starts to really kind of go off the rails

12:30.740 --> 12:31.580
in the language here,

12:31.580 --> 12:34.020
and I think this is why I originally gave them

12:34.020 --> 12:36.900
such a hard time is the way they say things.

12:36.900 --> 12:37.820
Yeah, I like this.

12:37.820 --> 12:39.840
The submarine-looking building gave home

12:39.840 --> 12:42.220
to an event gathering open source superheroes

12:42.220 --> 12:44.240
and all sorts of magical creatures

12:44.240 --> 12:47.340
because to quote the first Dev1 docs print,

12:47.340 --> 12:48.500
software freedom your way.

12:48.500 --> 12:51.180
We must apply thought and attention to software development.

12:51.180 --> 12:53.500
We share responsibility as users and developers

12:53.500 --> 12:56.300
of software systems to foster values of cooperation

12:56.300 --> 12:58.340
in the spirit of science, human cultures,

12:58.340 --> 13:00.140
and the diversity of life.

13:00.140 --> 13:01.380
That's pretty bold.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.780
They got a mission there.

13:02.780 --> 13:04.420
They're a project with a mission.

13:04.420 --> 13:06.060
I can't really argue with any of that though.

13:06.060 --> 13:08.340
I mean, they really grandiose in the way they talk,

13:08.340 --> 13:10.220
and if you're gonna do something like this,

13:10.220 --> 13:11.260
if you're gonna fork Debian

13:11.260 --> 13:13.500
and make a system-D free version of Debian,

13:13.500 --> 13:15.380
you've really gotta have some fundamental beliefs

13:15.380 --> 13:16.500
to be willing to put yourself

13:16.500 --> 13:18.020
through that kind of hell and torture.

13:18.020 --> 13:20.860
I will also say whatever salad that they're having there

13:20.860 --> 13:21.700
looks delicious.

13:21.700 --> 13:22.940
Yeah, I see a lot of cilantro.

13:22.940 --> 13:25.260
I think it's like a nacho thing, Wes.

13:25.260 --> 13:26.220
I don't know if it's a salad.

13:26.220 --> 13:27.700
Cause look at that melted, that's melted cheese, right?

13:27.700 --> 13:28.740
Oh, okay.

13:28.740 --> 13:29.820
Yeah, I think it's a salad.

13:29.820 --> 13:31.700
Look, then they got the plates with the cilantro on them.

13:31.700 --> 13:33.660
They're really big on the cilantro over there apparently.

13:33.660 --> 13:34.540
I'm down with that.

13:34.540 --> 13:36.660
Yeah, I don't mind a little cilantro.

13:36.660 --> 13:41.660
So speaking of ZFS, it appears that work is in way

13:41.660 --> 13:44.780
for Ubuntu 20.04-ish.

13:44.780 --> 13:47.660
And gentlemen, correct me if you know anything differently.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.020
Michael over at Ferronix writes

13:49.020 --> 13:52.380
that the ZFS undertaking is a huge effort.

13:52.380 --> 13:54.500
And we really haven't heard much about it.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.860
Although I was actually sniffing around

13:55.860 --> 13:57.100
and I did see some status updates

13:57.100 --> 13:59.300
about like testing and restoring stuff.

13:59.300 --> 14:01.000
So there is actual work underway.

14:01.900 --> 14:04.900
And it looks like it'll probably land

14:04.900 --> 14:09.660
for the user installer in 20.04, the LTS for next year.

14:09.660 --> 14:11.140
Feels far away, but really,

14:11.140 --> 14:14.180
it's not that far and there's a lot to get right here

14:14.180 --> 14:15.300
and you don't wanna mess it up.

14:15.300 --> 14:16.140
Yeah.

14:16.140 --> 14:21.140
Well, I've seen some stuff at company sprints,

14:21.220 --> 14:24.980
but I'm not sure if we're gonna land this for 20.04.

14:24.980 --> 14:25.900
Really?

14:25.900 --> 14:28.700
I'll have to go away and confer with my colleagues

14:28.700 --> 14:29.860
to be absolutely certain,

14:29.860 --> 14:32.820
but I think this is due to land after 20.04.

14:32.820 --> 14:35.900
Now the ZFS stuff or something else like a new installer?

14:35.900 --> 14:37.500
Both of those things, I believe.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.380
I see, okay.

14:39.380 --> 14:41.220
But the work has already started

14:41.220 --> 14:44.460
and I've definitely seen some prototypes working

14:44.460 --> 14:46.180
and I don't wanna give too much away,

14:46.180 --> 14:48.220
but there's some very interesting strategies

14:48.220 --> 14:51.560
that are being used to deploy this and it's pretty nifty.

14:51.560 --> 14:54.500
I will say that the time it takes to install

14:54.500 --> 14:57.860
is radically reduced using this mechanism.

14:57.860 --> 14:58.860
It's pretty impressive.

14:58.860 --> 15:03.140
Ooh, okay, now I'm properly teased.

15:03.140 --> 15:04.460
I also wanted to give a little plug skis

15:04.460 --> 15:07.660
to TechSnap, TechSnap.Systems slash 401.

15:07.660 --> 15:10.060
Wes and Jim did everyday ZFS,

15:10.060 --> 15:13.300
just really, really good information about ZFS,

15:13.300 --> 15:15.180
especially for everyday use cases.

15:15.180 --> 15:16.140
Busted some myths,

15:16.140 --> 15:18.900
covered some of the license and legality stuff.

15:18.900 --> 15:20.700
You know, Jim just lives and breathes ZFS

15:20.700 --> 15:22.020
and it's kind of a TechSnap tradition,

15:22.020 --> 15:23.260
so I thought we should have our take on it.

15:23.260 --> 15:24.520
I was gonna say that.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.700
It is a TechSnap tradition, so yeah.

15:26.700 --> 15:29.060
TechSnap.Systems slash 401.

15:29.060 --> 15:31.180
If you want that, I enjoyed it.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.020
I enjoyed it.

15:32.020 --> 15:32.840
I did too.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.420
Yep, you guys make a good team.

15:34.420 --> 15:37.140
I miss doing the show, but you guys make a good team.

15:37.140 --> 15:38.660
Well, that's the community news.

15:38.660 --> 15:39.620
Pretty brief today.

15:39.620 --> 15:41.500
Pretty brief today, so I think we should move on.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.860
Move on with the rest of the show.

15:42.860 --> 15:44.700
Let's get into a little housekeeping.

15:44.700 --> 15:47.260
And for fun, I'm gonna do it

15:47.260 --> 15:49.380
with a little music this week.

15:49.380 --> 15:50.220
Yeah?

15:50.220 --> 15:51.620
Yeah, just to kind of keep it going.

15:51.620 --> 15:52.460
Just to kind of keep going.

15:52.460 --> 15:53.280
Keep our house clean.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.020
We do have a couple of things to talk about

15:55.020 --> 15:56.380
in the housekeeping this week.

15:56.380 --> 15:58.220
Yeah, get out, get it tidy.

15:58.220 --> 16:00.440
First of all, big, big deal.

16:00.440 --> 16:03.900
Linux Academy is doing a 299-year promo right now.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.140
It's a 33% discount.

16:06.140 --> 16:06.980
That's great.

16:06.980 --> 16:07.820
Go take advantage of that

16:07.820 --> 16:10.620
by going to linuxacademy.com and sign up.

16:10.620 --> 16:12.300
It's in effect for about a week or two.

16:12.300 --> 16:13.140
I don't know.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.180
It started yesterday, and it's a limited time offer,

16:15.180 --> 16:16.020
so go check it out.

16:16.020 --> 16:17.340
Divide that by 12, and you'll be like,

16:17.340 --> 16:18.700
okay, yeah, that's a good deal.

16:18.700 --> 16:19.540
Very good deal.

16:19.540 --> 16:21.500
Plus, they're launching a bunch of content right now too.

16:21.500 --> 16:24.940
Now, Friday, Friday on the jblive.tv stream,

16:24.940 --> 16:26.300
we're doing a little hangout.

16:26.300 --> 16:27.580
We'll be doing it at 2 p.m.

16:27.580 --> 16:29.920
Jupiter Broadcasting Time, that's specific.

16:29.920 --> 16:31.220
You can get it converted to your local time

16:31.220 --> 16:33.600
at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

16:33.600 --> 16:34.460
Just hanging out.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.340
We wanted to do some community interaction stuff.

16:36.340 --> 16:37.820
We'll do a week in review.

16:37.820 --> 16:40.940
We'll review some of the show clips,

16:40.940 --> 16:43.900
expand on a little further, hang out, chat with the crew.

16:43.900 --> 16:45.140
We're gonna try to have a lot

16:45.140 --> 16:47.740
of the Jupiter Broadcasting crew participate as they can.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.900
Just a little hangout session, jblive.tv,

16:49.900 --> 16:52.980
2 p.m. Pacific this Friday, and hopefully next Friday,

16:52.980 --> 16:54.420
when we'll have people in town.

16:54.420 --> 16:55.380
Oh, yeah.

16:55.380 --> 16:58.060
People in town can stop by while they're in studio

16:58.060 --> 16:59.780
and hang out with us on the Friday stream.

16:59.780 --> 17:02.540
Always a good time to join live, join the IRC room too.

17:02.540 --> 17:03.820
Totes.

17:03.820 --> 17:05.140
Speaking of Linux Fest.

17:05.140 --> 17:06.260
Oh, it's coming up.

17:06.260 --> 17:08.380
Yeah, and if you're coming and you're gonna hang out

17:08.380 --> 17:10.820
at our Linux Fest parking lot barbecue,

17:10.820 --> 17:14.340
if you're driving, consider bringing your own chair, please.

17:14.340 --> 17:15.220
We'll have some chairs,

17:15.220 --> 17:16.540
especially for those of you who are flying in,

17:16.540 --> 17:19.660
because I can't expect you to bring a chair on the airplane.

17:19.660 --> 17:21.540
But if you're flying up and you have the room,

17:21.540 --> 17:24.020
you might bring a camping chair too with you.

17:24.020 --> 17:26.020
Everybody likes to sit, right?

17:26.020 --> 17:26.860
Everybody likes to sit.

17:26.860 --> 17:29.860
And last but not least, very awesome,

17:29.860 --> 17:31.660
our community is self-organizing

17:31.660 --> 17:33.860
in the Linux Fest Telegram group right now

17:33.860 --> 17:36.140
for carpools from the airport.

17:36.140 --> 17:38.860
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Linux Fest.

17:38.860 --> 17:41.060
Angela has made a spreadsheet

17:41.060 --> 17:42.460
that people can put their names in

17:42.460 --> 17:44.900
and time of arrival and all that date stuff.

17:44.900 --> 17:47.300
And then people can organize and give each other rides.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.780
That's happening right now in our Telegram group.

17:48.780 --> 17:51.940
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Linux Fest.

17:51.940 --> 17:56.300
And last but not least, Mr. Bacon's here with the job report.

17:56.300 --> 17:58.660
We got a special community job posting, don't we?

17:58.660 --> 17:59.500
Yes, we do.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.540
We had one of our community members, Jacob,

18:01.540 --> 18:06.380
reach out to me this last week on our Telegram,

18:06.380 --> 18:08.460
which you can find a link to that

18:08.460 --> 18:11.060
if you go to Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

18:11.060 --> 18:13.060
Up at the top, you'll see a Telegram icon.

18:13.060 --> 18:15.540
Click on that and you can join us.

18:15.540 --> 18:18.060
But he works for a company called Simplot.

18:19.420 --> 18:21.820
They're an agriculture company.

18:21.820 --> 18:24.460
So they do a lot of work with farmers and such.

18:24.460 --> 18:25.620
They're currently looking for

18:25.620 --> 18:28.580
an infrastructure engineer three

18:28.580 --> 18:32.780
to work in their Boise, Idaho office.

18:32.780 --> 18:36.340
They go in to talking about what you'll need to do.

18:36.340 --> 18:40.060
And we'll have this link posted in the show notes.

18:41.140 --> 18:44.060
But you'll provide rock-solid platforms to run workloads

18:44.060 --> 18:46.780
such as MySQL, Apache, WebLogic, Tomcat,

18:46.780 --> 18:49.260
HANA, Docker, OpenShift, Hadoop.

18:50.220 --> 18:51.300
All those things, obviously,

18:51.300 --> 18:53.100
you can get training for on Linux Academy.

18:53.100 --> 18:55.580
Maybe we have some Linux Academy students out there

18:55.580 --> 18:57.460
that might be interested.

18:57.460 --> 18:59.740
This would be a good place to apply.

18:59.740 --> 19:01.180
I've talked to Jacob and he said that the team

19:01.180 --> 19:02.740
is a really awesome team to work with.

19:02.740 --> 19:06.540
So if you're looking for a job, this might be for you.

19:06.540 --> 19:07.420
There you go.

19:07.420 --> 19:09.580
Combining farming and Linux together.

19:09.580 --> 19:10.420
Amazing.

19:10.420 --> 19:11.260
That'd be pretty good.

19:11.260 --> 19:12.340
We'll have a link in the show notes.

19:12.340 --> 19:13.820
Go check that out.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.500
Thank you, Mr. Bacon, for the job report there.

19:15.500 --> 19:19.060
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the housekeeping.

19:19.060 --> 19:19.900
See, we got through it.

19:19.900 --> 19:20.900
Good job, everybody.

19:20.900 --> 19:21.980
Got through that pretty fast, actually.

19:21.980 --> 19:22.980
I'm so proud of us.

19:22.980 --> 19:24.100
I felt good.

19:24.100 --> 19:25.020
That felt really good.

19:25.020 --> 19:25.860
All right.

19:25.860 --> 19:28.060
Well, I think this is why we're all

19:28.060 --> 19:29.020
kind of in a rush today.

19:29.020 --> 19:29.860
This is what we're really-

19:29.860 --> 19:30.700
There's a lot to chew on.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.700
This is what we're here for today.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.700
Very, very much, very much so.

19:34.700 --> 19:39.140
Looking forward to talking about Ubuntu 19.04, disco, dingo.

19:39.140 --> 19:44.140
Everybody's doing disco, disco, disco, disco, disco, disco.

19:47.660 --> 19:51.620
The new 19.04 release is a really big deal

19:51.620 --> 19:53.180
for a non-LTS release.

19:53.180 --> 19:56.580
In fact, I'd argue it's one of the bigger deals

19:56.580 --> 19:58.860
for a non-LTS release in years.

19:58.860 --> 20:01.900
In fact, even bigger than 17.10 was,

20:01.900 --> 20:04.740
which was the first version that switched to GNOME.

20:04.740 --> 20:06.380
And to give us some context,

20:06.380 --> 20:09.180
while I feel this is sort of a big deal,

20:09.180 --> 20:11.620
is I want to go back in time for a moment.

20:11.620 --> 20:15.380
Let's go back almost two years right on the nose

20:15.380 --> 20:18.940
when Noah and I were standing at Dell headquarters

20:18.940 --> 20:22.540
covering the news that Canonical was dropping Unity.

20:22.540 --> 20:26.180
So Mark Shuttleworth just sort of changed

20:26.180 --> 20:28.100
the Linux landscape in a big way.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.060
And I say that once we get into it,

20:30.060 --> 20:32.120
I think you'll understand why I say that.

20:32.120 --> 20:34.940
But what was announced was that Canonical,

20:35.780 --> 20:37.940
starting with, was it 18.04?

20:37.940 --> 20:39.080
Right, next LTS.

20:39.080 --> 20:42.980
The next LTS, they're going to switch to GNOME by default.

20:42.980 --> 20:47.980
And they will be de-investing efforts into Unity 8.

20:48.140 --> 20:50.860
They will be sunsetting Unity 7.

20:50.860 --> 20:52.740
They will be shipping GNOME by default

20:52.740 --> 20:55.500
on the next LTS Ubuntu.

20:55.500 --> 20:57.700
And the ramifications of that are ginormous.

20:57.700 --> 21:00.820
There's a personnel ramification within Canonical.

21:00.820 --> 21:03.580
And we actually ended up seeing shipping before 18.04.

21:03.580 --> 21:06.080
It ended up shipping in one of the point releases

21:06.080 --> 21:06.920
ahead of time.

21:06.920 --> 21:09.180
And I think it is unquestionable that it has really,

21:09.180 --> 21:11.200
it has really changed the Linux desktop

21:11.200 --> 21:12.540
in the last couple of years.

21:12.540 --> 21:14.220
It has been a couple of wild rides.

21:14.220 --> 21:17.700
And while why I believe 19.04 is a bigger deal

21:17.700 --> 21:19.260
than your average bear,

21:19.260 --> 21:21.260
is because it is truly the release

21:21.260 --> 21:26.260
that is the full net result of this new focus.

21:27.020 --> 21:29.060
17.10 was the first go.

21:29.060 --> 21:31.180
18.04 was a stable shot at it.

21:31.180 --> 21:32.980
You know, let's make sure we're conservative here.

21:32.980 --> 21:34.980
There's a lot to consider for an LTS release.

21:34.980 --> 21:38.100
So this, you know, one more past that and...

21:38.100 --> 21:41.620
And now with 19.04, you've got GNOME 3.32.

21:41.620 --> 21:45.780
You've got Mesa 19.0, Linux kernel 5.0,

21:45.780 --> 21:48.860
and the new default Yaru theme,

21:48.860 --> 21:51.420
which gives it its own unique look again.

21:51.420 --> 21:56.420
So Ubuntu looks modern, but unique again, and still.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.480
And so I think it was these reasons perhaps

21:59.480 --> 22:00.660
that you and I were,

22:02.860 --> 22:04.080
I guess it wasn't just these reasons,

22:04.080 --> 22:07.460
but it's these reasons amongst also all of the work

22:07.460 --> 22:09.940
that's gone into GNOME Shell by Canonical,

22:09.940 --> 22:11.540
by Red Hat employees, by Endless,

22:11.540 --> 22:15.940
that have really made it much, much more performant.

22:15.940 --> 22:17.980
And we had been watching the development of that,

22:17.980 --> 22:20.260
you and I were like, we've got to try this.

22:20.260 --> 22:21.580
There's just so much going on.

22:21.580 --> 22:23.980
It kept feeling like it kept getting better and better.

22:23.980 --> 22:25.420
Yeah, and we've been on Plasma at that point

22:25.420 --> 22:26.540
for nearly a year.

22:26.540 --> 22:27.820
A long time, yeah.

22:27.820 --> 22:29.020
Almost, yeah.

22:29.020 --> 22:30.380
And at least for me, yeah.

22:30.380 --> 22:32.060
And nearly a year for you.

22:32.060 --> 22:34.180
And it was just kind of time to like dip our toe

22:34.180 --> 22:35.500
in the GNOME world again and see,

22:35.500 --> 22:37.860
okay, how does 3.32 really shake up?

22:37.860 --> 22:40.300
Like, is it better?

22:40.300 --> 22:43.800
And you could just instantly,

22:43.800 --> 22:46.700
instantly within moments of logging in,

22:46.700 --> 22:48.540
notice a performance difference.

22:48.540 --> 22:50.960
Animations were clearly smoother.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.620
They just felt snappier.

22:52.620 --> 22:54.260
Most of it is the things that you don't see.

22:54.260 --> 22:55.460
It just is snappy.

22:55.460 --> 22:56.620
Things happen quickly.

22:56.620 --> 22:58.820
It's almost like there's the Joe style,

22:58.820 --> 23:01.140
no transitions anywhere effect.

23:01.140 --> 23:03.380
Yeah, and I thought, okay,

23:03.380 --> 23:06.940
well, let's give it a go on Fedora Rawhide, right?

23:06.940 --> 23:08.740
Because that's supposed to be a real GNOME showcase.

23:08.740 --> 23:10.900
So let's give it a go over there

23:10.900 --> 23:14.180
and see what 3.32 is like on Rawhide.

23:14.180 --> 23:15.220
And it was pretty great.

23:15.220 --> 23:16.900
It was quite great, actually.

23:16.900 --> 23:18.700
Yeah, I remember you telling me that you were doing that.

23:18.700 --> 23:21.140
Honestly, I know you, I know how much you like Fedora.

23:21.140 --> 23:23.060
I expected you to be sitting out there

23:23.060 --> 23:24.060
on Fedora for a while.

23:24.060 --> 23:25.820
I did too.

23:25.820 --> 23:27.080
But I will say this,

23:27.080 --> 23:31.020
there are a few vendor modifications to the GNOME shell

23:31.020 --> 23:32.540
that Canonical makes,

23:32.540 --> 23:36.860
the combination of their doc and the Yaru theme

23:36.860 --> 23:39.500
and the performance fixes that I think they've implemented

23:39.500 --> 23:41.480
that aren't necessarily on Fedora yet,

23:41.480 --> 23:45.440
kind of came together to make the GNOME 19.04 experience

23:45.440 --> 23:47.440
superior, in my opinion.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.960
And after running Rawhide for a couple of weeks,

23:49.960 --> 23:54.040
I switched back to 19.04 and just went all in.

23:54.040 --> 23:57.520
And I found the performance to be noticeably better.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.680
Wow, and that is impressive.

23:58.680 --> 24:01.920
It's funny to think about that we had two years ago

24:01.920 --> 24:03.080
when we were first talking about this,

24:03.080 --> 24:06.120
we were kind of wondering about what the future investments

24:06.120 --> 24:09.160
of Canonical into the desktop might be, right?

24:09.160 --> 24:10.480
Switching to GNOME, was this just gonna be,

24:10.480 --> 24:12.280
we were like, is this gonna be a stock GNOME

24:12.280 --> 24:13.400
or are we really gonna see something

24:13.400 --> 24:15.800
that feels like Ubuntu?

24:15.800 --> 24:18.240
And I think now we can say, we can answer that.

24:18.240 --> 24:21.560
Yeah, in fact, going back in time again, two years,

24:21.560 --> 24:24.000
you and Noah were sitting here on this very show

24:24.000 --> 24:25.160
while I was driving up from Dell.

24:25.160 --> 24:26.320
You lazy schmuck.

24:26.320 --> 24:29.400
And we're pontificating on what this might mean

24:29.400 --> 24:31.320
for future Linux users.

24:31.320 --> 24:33.080
I think that it's gonna be a really great thing

24:33.080 --> 24:35.840
for Linux as a whole to have the biggest manufacturers

24:35.840 --> 24:37.400
of the desktop Linux operating system,

24:37.400 --> 24:39.160
that being Red Hat and Canonical,

24:39.160 --> 24:40.920
both of them working together

24:40.920 --> 24:43.680
to form a single desktop environment.

24:43.680 --> 24:46.240
And I think it's gonna be really good for the end users

24:46.240 --> 24:47.520
because they're gonna have more freedom

24:47.520 --> 24:49.040
to go from one to store the other

24:49.040 --> 24:50.600
and it's all gonna look the same because,

24:50.600 --> 24:51.960
hey, they're starting with GNOME.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.440
And this idea that we'd see some real improvements

24:54.440 --> 24:58.000
with everybody focusing on one desktop environment

24:58.000 --> 24:59.560
was theoretical at the time.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.800
But here we are two years later

25:00.800 --> 25:05.640
and it's clearly had some great improvements for GNOME.

25:05.640 --> 25:08.080
It's not 100% yet.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.720
It has still crashed on me.

25:09.720 --> 25:12.200
I'm gonna say, you've spent quite some time

25:12.200 --> 25:14.080
on this here show talking about some of the problems

25:14.080 --> 25:14.920
with GNOME.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.680
And you had some shell crashes in 1904 as well.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.520
Yeah, admittedly, I was kind of pushing things

25:18.520 --> 25:19.360
to its limits.

25:19.360 --> 25:23.320
I might keep Plasma as my audio workstation.

25:23.320 --> 25:25.320
But the rest of the time, it was super pleasant.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.200
And kind of, I might prefer that, honestly.

25:27.200 --> 25:31.160
I might just like GNOME as everyday browsing.

25:31.160 --> 25:32.520
It's kind of perfect for just, you know,

25:32.520 --> 25:34.760
maybe a terminal, a couple of electron apps

25:34.760 --> 25:35.600
and a web browser.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.840
Where it doesn't need to be a mission critical workstation.

25:37.840 --> 25:38.680
Mm-hmm.

25:38.680 --> 25:39.520
It's not bad.

25:39.520 --> 25:40.360
Not at all.

25:40.360 --> 25:43.880
No, I really, it's snappy, it's easy, it's very intuitive.

25:43.880 --> 25:48.120
And I like that I can just mostly, especially on 1904,

25:48.120 --> 25:49.200
I can run the default.

25:49.200 --> 25:52.200
I don't need to spend that sort of Plasma investment time

25:52.200 --> 25:53.040
of tuning everything.

25:53.040 --> 25:53.880
Right.

25:53.880 --> 25:54.720
It just works.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.360
I gotta give you a ding on that.

25:56.360 --> 25:58.560
Because that is a big differentiator.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.120
I just got right to work.

26:00.120 --> 26:00.960
I really did.

26:00.960 --> 26:04.000
I think I installed one or two extra extensions.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.880
I like having the ping indicator up in my thing.

26:05.880 --> 26:06.720
Yeah, that's right.

26:06.720 --> 26:07.640
I like that.

26:07.640 --> 26:10.360
And that might have been it.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.360
That might have been it.

26:11.360 --> 26:12.200
Yeah.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.600
And I was good to go.

26:13.600 --> 26:18.040
But 1904 isn't just the default release.

26:18.040 --> 26:21.320
It is a ecosystem of flavors.

26:21.320 --> 26:23.760
And I kind of wanted to turn it over to the mobile room

26:23.760 --> 26:27.200
and talk with Mr. Popey and Mr. Wimpy about their thoughts

26:27.200 --> 26:29.160
on the 1904 release.

26:29.160 --> 26:30.440
Mr. Popey, I'll start with you.

26:30.440 --> 26:34.640
Are you even trying out the betas anymore?

26:34.640 --> 26:36.760
Or are you just sticking on 1804?

26:36.760 --> 26:40.080
I was so excited about the performance improvements

26:40.080 --> 26:43.480
in 1904 and other UX improvements.

26:43.480 --> 26:45.720
I might get an opportunity to mention

26:45.720 --> 26:48.480
that I upgraded two of my machines.

26:48.480 --> 26:52.720
I've got a ThinkPad X220 and an Entroware Athena,

26:52.720 --> 26:54.000
which is quite a beefy machine.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.320
So I've got two ends of the scale,

26:55.320 --> 26:57.600
one with an Nvidia GPU, one with an Intel GPU.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.560
So I wanted to be able to see how this thing performs

27:00.560 --> 27:03.720
on different chipsets at different ends of the scale.

27:03.720 --> 27:04.560
And I love it.

27:04.560 --> 27:05.400
It's really great.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.080
It's so much better.

27:07.080 --> 27:10.920
And I feel fine upgrading away from an LTS.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.560
I'm usually the kind of person who sticks on LTSs.

27:13.560 --> 27:16.120
On those two machines, I've moved.

27:16.120 --> 27:17.360
That's the ultimate benchmark.

27:17.360 --> 27:19.840
In fact, I want to come back to that very question

27:19.840 --> 27:20.800
here in a second.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.560
But you said two things I'd like to circle back to.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.920
Number one, I'm curious to know what the performance

27:25.920 --> 27:28.040
difference is like on Intel versus Nvidia.

27:28.040 --> 27:30.600
And then I'm also curious what those other UI improvements

27:30.600 --> 27:31.840
are that drew you in.

27:31.840 --> 27:34.800
So I don't notice, really, a lot of difference

27:34.800 --> 27:37.440
between the Intel laptop.

27:37.440 --> 27:38.360
And it's a few years old.

27:38.360 --> 27:41.000
It's like a 2012 Sandy Bridge i7.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.640
So I mean, it's not a slouch.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.920
But still, it's an Intel GPU.

27:44.920 --> 27:48.200
And it's not a top-end brand new one.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.400
And the Nvidia GPU is a 960 mobile device,

27:51.400 --> 27:53.360
which is relatively common.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.840
And it's, again, not the top of the range.

27:55.840 --> 28:00.720
I'm not wimpy with 1070 Ti's coming out the wazoo.

28:00.720 --> 28:01.680
1070?

28:01.680 --> 28:04.680
I'm not a peasant.

28:04.680 --> 28:06.040
Triggered.

28:06.040 --> 28:06.600
Oh, man.

28:06.600 --> 28:13.240
But the performance is comparable across them.

28:13.240 --> 28:14.480
It's just the same.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.720
It's the applications that are the problem now.

28:16.720 --> 28:18.800
The shell isn't the problem anymore.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.760
It's all these big fat applications

28:20.760 --> 28:21.760
I'm running on top of them.

28:21.760 --> 28:22.240
Sure.

28:22.240 --> 28:23.320
And were there other?

28:23.320 --> 28:25.360
You said there was some UI improvements, too.

28:25.360 --> 28:28.840
Yeah, I've personally complained.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.960
And I know many of our users did about some

28:31.960 --> 28:36.320
of the UX of application switching

28:36.320 --> 28:39.360
and the way the shell does application switching.

28:39.360 --> 28:43.120
The alt tab and alt.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.600
What's that key above tab?

28:44.600 --> 28:47.840
In Unity land, we used to call it the key above tab.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.560
Yeah, it's tilde, but it's not on a Mac.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.040
It's grave.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.120
Yeah, but it's not a grave.

28:52.120 --> 28:53.120
It's a key above tab.

28:53.120 --> 28:54.120
Oh, god.

28:54.120 --> 28:57.520
It's, sorry.

28:57.520 --> 29:01.520
But the improvements to the way switching windows

29:01.520 --> 29:05.200
is massive for me because I often

29:05.200 --> 29:07.800
have multiple windows for each application open.

29:07.800 --> 29:11.240
And what I hate is alt tabbing between two applications

29:11.240 --> 29:13.560
and being punched in the face by lots of windows

29:13.560 --> 29:14.360
coming to the front.

29:14.360 --> 29:15.480
I only want one of them.

29:15.480 --> 29:19.840
And having to do a dance with multiple alt tab and alt grave

29:19.840 --> 29:21.920
is just bizarre.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.000
So we fixed that in 1904.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.080
The desktop team fixed that in 1904.

29:26.080 --> 29:27.800
I'll admit to being confused at first

29:27.800 --> 29:30.800
because I got pretty used to the old admittedly

29:30.800 --> 29:31.880
unintuitive method.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.800
Yeah, yeah, totally.

29:33.800 --> 29:37.160
And the sound panel is easy to use.

29:37.160 --> 29:39.320
So it's a lot more intuitive.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.120
Oh, I just love the new system preferences.

29:41.120 --> 29:43.240
It's gotten so much better since I've used GNOME.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.200
Yeah, GNOME upstream have done a really good job

29:45.200 --> 29:47.200
with the redesign of the setting stuff.

29:47.200 --> 29:50.760
And we're consuming that pretty much as it is.

29:50.760 --> 29:51.480
It's great.

29:51.480 --> 29:52.520
Now, what about you, Mr. Wimpy?

29:52.520 --> 29:54.280
What are your thoughts on the 1904 release,

29:54.280 --> 29:57.120
both from a Maté standpoint, but also just what

29:57.120 --> 29:58.320
you hear around town?

29:58.320 --> 30:00.000
Well, there's obviously, being a flavor,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.280
there's obviously a number of advantages

30:02.280 --> 30:05.520
that you get to inherit just by being based on top of Ubuntu.

30:05.520 --> 30:08.000
So there's a couple of subtle things this time

30:08.000 --> 30:10.240
around that are probably worth pointing out

30:10.240 --> 30:14.000
that you might not notice unless you had it explained to you.

30:14.000 --> 30:19.320
So everyone may have heard of or be familiar with WPA supplicant,

30:19.320 --> 30:22.000
which is a tool to manage your Wi-Fi.

30:22.000 --> 30:22.920
Yeah.

30:22.920 --> 30:28.720
And the new hotness, maybe, is a tool called IWD.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.840
So in Network Manager in this release,

30:30.840 --> 30:33.360
you can optionally choose to use IWD

30:33.360 --> 30:39.080
to manage your network authentication, which is good.

30:39.080 --> 30:42.200
And that could well be a default in the future,

30:42.200 --> 30:44.440
and that's one of the reasons why it's here for playing

30:44.440 --> 30:46.200
and testing with.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.920
And then a simple thing.

30:47.920 --> 30:51.240
In the Boot Manager these days, you'll

30:51.240 --> 30:53.200
find the Safe Graphics mode.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.200
So for all of the different boot options,

30:55.200 --> 30:59.120
you'll find a duplicate entry which says Safe Graphics Mode,

30:59.120 --> 31:02.000
and that automatically sets no mode set.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.320
And anyone not familiar with what that does,

31:04.320 --> 31:08.600
that effectively sidesteps the DRM driver modules.

31:08.600 --> 31:12.640
So if you have a GPU which is not well supported

31:12.640 --> 31:15.200
by your kernel by default, you can

31:15.200 --> 31:18.080
use that to get installed using a basic frame buffer

31:18.080 --> 31:20.600
and then install your drivers after the fact

31:20.600 --> 31:21.680
to get a working system.

31:21.680 --> 31:25.120
And that's a small thing, but it's a nice little change.

31:25.120 --> 31:27.200
So that's something that all of the flavors

31:27.200 --> 31:30.760
get to benefit from.

31:30.760 --> 31:32.600
In terms of Ubuntu MATE itself, it's

31:32.600 --> 31:34.560
a bit of a dull release for us.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.680
It's just bug fixes and finessing,

31:37.680 --> 31:41.960
one of the reasons being I work alongside the Debian packaging

31:41.960 --> 31:42.440
team.

31:42.440 --> 31:43.800
They've got a release coming up.

31:43.800 --> 31:45.960
Debian 10 is just around the corner,

31:45.960 --> 31:48.240
and I've been doing all of the package

31:48.240 --> 31:51.480
uplifts for MATE in Debian.

31:51.480 --> 31:54.080
So we kind of put things on hiatus

31:54.080 --> 31:56.360
because we've done this in the past

31:56.360 --> 31:57.840
and made a right Horlicks of it where

31:57.840 --> 32:01.000
we get this split of the versions of MATE in Debian

32:01.000 --> 32:02.520
and the versions of MATE in Ubuntu,

32:02.520 --> 32:05.960
and it all becomes a big pickle that we have to sort out.

32:05.960 --> 32:10.160
So I've stuck alongside the Debian versions that are going

32:10.160 --> 32:11.760
to be in Debian Buster.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.520
I've committed all of my changes to Debian Git

32:14.520 --> 32:17.360
last week for the new version of MATE,

32:17.360 --> 32:19.400
including all of the fixes we needed

32:19.400 --> 32:23.000
to do on some third party modules to get that stable.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.880
So when we enter the 19.10 release,

32:26.880 --> 32:30.880
we'll hit the ground running with MATE 1.22 from day one.

32:30.880 --> 32:34.320
Now, I've been testing all of the flavors,

32:34.320 --> 32:37.200
and I would just like to put a little hat tip out there

32:37.200 --> 32:39.440
to the Ubuntu budget team.

32:39.440 --> 32:43.660
That is a really, really nice implementation.

32:43.660 --> 32:45.920
I was seriously impressed.

32:45.920 --> 32:46.560
Yeah.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.200
A great way to have a modern desktop

32:48.200 --> 32:51.680
and run some GTK applications without using Home Shell.

32:51.680 --> 32:52.800
Completely agree.

32:52.800 --> 32:53.600
It's terrific.

32:53.600 --> 32:54.640
It's really, really good.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.440
I mean, it's been a while since I used it.

32:56.440 --> 32:59.860
I think I last installed the 18.04 version, which was good,

32:59.860 --> 33:03.560
but this version seems really bob on, really good.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.920
So well done to the guys over there.

33:05.920 --> 33:07.920
Congratulations on a fine release.

33:07.920 --> 33:09.720
You should be very proud of yourselves.

33:09.720 --> 33:16.480
You know, I'll also give a shout out to the Ubuntu release.

33:16.480 --> 33:20.400
So I obviously spent the vast, vast majority

33:20.400 --> 33:24.160
of my time on the Gnome Shell implementation of 19.04.

33:24.160 --> 33:28.920
However, I have found it to be, it being Gnome Shell,

33:28.920 --> 33:34.600
to be particularly challenging when I go beyond two monitors.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.400
When I get into three and four monitors

33:36.400 --> 33:41.240
that are like a DisplayPort over USB-C specifically, yeah.

33:41.240 --> 33:42.160
That sounds complicated.

33:42.160 --> 33:42.660
Right.

33:42.660 --> 33:45.800
And so I grant you, it shouldn't be perfect, right?

33:45.800 --> 33:49.000
I mean, it should be, but I understand why it's not.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.120
But you like working.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.960
Gnome Shell really kind of gets sporadic

33:51.960 --> 33:54.340
about what monitor it's going to turn on when I boot up

33:54.340 --> 33:55.760
and which ones don't get activated

33:55.760 --> 33:58.160
and what orientate, because some of them are vertical.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.660
And so what orientation is the screen?

33:59.660 --> 34:02.640
And all of that basically changes every time I boot.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.600
I never know what I'm going to get.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.360
And maybe there's a method to the madness,

34:06.360 --> 34:07.440
but I can't figure it out.

34:07.440 --> 34:10.940
So after getting my feet fully wet on Gnome Shell

34:10.940 --> 34:14.760
and really enjoying it, I think my inner Joe came out.

34:14.760 --> 34:15.880
Everyone has one.

34:15.880 --> 34:20.720
And I ended up installing the Zubuntu 1904 desktop.

34:20.720 --> 34:21.920
And I have to say.

34:21.920 --> 34:25.260
I'm kind of imagining you clicking over to the download

34:25.260 --> 34:28.120
page and sneakily not admitting it to yourself

34:28.120 --> 34:30.280
as you click the Download ISO button and install it.

34:30.280 --> 34:31.880
I haven't even told you.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.120
How could I?

34:33.120 --> 34:34.720
He knew he was right this entire time.

34:34.720 --> 34:35.760
That's amazing.

34:35.760 --> 34:38.640
I have to say, it is extremely pleasant.

34:38.640 --> 34:41.320
It is wicked fast.

34:41.320 --> 34:43.820
It uses a tiny amount of resources.

34:43.820 --> 34:45.360
All these things don't really matter.

34:45.360 --> 34:46.760
I mean, that wicked fast matters.

34:46.760 --> 34:50.080
But the resources, not as much, but it matters.

34:50.080 --> 34:52.920
And yeah, there's things about it that are old school.

34:52.920 --> 34:55.320
Like setting up my panel feels old school and stuff like that.

34:55.320 --> 34:59.840
But once I have it set, man, like if it isn't just

34:59.840 --> 35:02.600
set it and forget it and then just use your computer.

35:02.600 --> 35:06.040
And just it's everything I got out of Gnome Shell,

35:06.040 --> 35:09.080
but just straightforward and simpler.

35:09.080 --> 35:14.160
And I really feel like it's a great recording workstation

35:14.160 --> 35:16.880
desktop or a great workstation desktop.

35:16.880 --> 35:19.920
I will very much be considering just switching my desktops

35:19.920 --> 35:21.160
over to Xubuntu.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.080
I mean, it makes sense.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.000
It's been around.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.960
Nothing needs to have changed except there's just

35:24.960 --> 35:26.840
made steady improvements.

35:26.840 --> 35:29.360
Now the question is, are there, and maybe Wimpy,

35:29.360 --> 35:30.720
maybe you have an answer to this,

35:30.720 --> 35:32.520
are there as many compelling reasons for me

35:32.520 --> 35:34.920
to use 19.04 if I'm using Xubuntu?

35:34.920 --> 35:38.080
Or should I just stay on 18.04 and use Xubuntu?

35:38.080 --> 35:40.600
Because I don't think the XFCEs, I mean,

35:40.600 --> 35:41.680
I didn't really check.

35:41.680 --> 35:44.040
I mean, it feels like with XFCE it doesn't really matter.

35:44.040 --> 35:47.800
It's, I just, I feel like it'd be the same XFCE regardless.

35:47.800 --> 35:50.960
I think you're doing a little bit of a disservice to XFCE.

35:50.960 --> 35:55.040
I know they are making the sort of steady march

35:55.040 --> 35:58.480
to GTK3 only future.

35:58.480 --> 36:01.880
And more of the component technologies

36:01.880 --> 36:04.480
that make up their desktop offering

36:04.480 --> 36:06.680
have been moved over to GTK3.

36:06.680 --> 36:09.920
So that work is ongoing.

36:09.920 --> 36:13.520
So and there's, if you follow Simon's blog,

36:13.520 --> 36:16.480
this is a different Simon to Simon Quigley, obviously,

36:16.480 --> 36:18.920
you will find that there's regular updates

36:18.920 --> 36:20.720
on the improvements and new features

36:20.720 --> 36:22.760
that they're adding to their suite of applications.

36:22.760 --> 36:24.920
So, you know, they're going about their business

36:24.920 --> 36:25.960
very methodically.

36:25.960 --> 36:26.800
Yeah.

36:26.800 --> 36:29.760
And not upsetting, you know, the Apple Car

36:29.760 --> 36:31.920
in terms of, you know, how it looks and behaves.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.840
You know, it's, I think Joe said, you know,

36:33.840 --> 36:38.240
it was a comfortingly familiar when he installed 19.04.

36:38.240 --> 36:42.520
It is truly a fantastic power user experience.

36:42.520 --> 36:44.000
It is so simple, it is so straightforward.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.440
In fact, not even for power users,

36:45.440 --> 36:47.760
but just all the things I appreciate about a desktop,

36:47.760 --> 36:48.600
it is that.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.560
And no one complains that there are moving features.

36:50.560 --> 36:53.360
I was very, very, very, very impressed.

36:53.360 --> 36:54.860
So that brings me to the question

36:54.860 --> 36:56.600
that Popey alluded to earlier.

36:56.600 --> 37:01.600
Is it worth switching from an LTS 18.04 to 19.04

37:02.120 --> 37:04.160
and getting back on that upgrade train

37:04.160 --> 37:06.800
where you have to upgrade every so often?

37:06.800 --> 37:09.480
And I'm wondering what your take is, Wes,

37:09.480 --> 37:13.240
is it worth switching out, say, your laptop here,

37:13.240 --> 37:17.020
which has Kubuntu on it right now, 18.04,

37:17.020 --> 37:20.120
would you consider replacing that with 19.04?

37:20.120 --> 37:20.960
Yeah, absolutely.

37:20.960 --> 37:23.220
I mean, for my personal workstations,

37:23.220 --> 37:25.160
at least for ones that I touch every day,

37:25.160 --> 37:28.040
let's say, or nearly every day, that's reasonable.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.380
It's like a reasonable amount of work.

37:29.380 --> 37:30.520
It serves as a good, you know,

37:30.520 --> 37:32.480
good making sure that I have documentation

37:32.480 --> 37:34.460
about everything that I know and need to install

37:34.460 --> 37:36.280
on a workstation that I'm using.

37:36.280 --> 37:37.880
And especially in the case, you know,

37:37.880 --> 37:40.360
this time around with the GNOME improvements,

37:40.360 --> 37:41.920
I like having up-to-date packages.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.120
I used Arch for a long time.

37:43.120 --> 37:45.480
I've been using Ubuntu more recently,

37:45.480 --> 37:47.080
but I'm still that same Wes.

37:47.080 --> 37:48.680
It is just getting to that age where it's like,

37:48.680 --> 37:49.520
I could use a couple of packages.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.080
Now, you do have to balance that, right?

37:51.080 --> 37:53.220
Like, especially if you have like maybe a lot of PPAs

37:53.220 --> 37:54.600
that you have to wait to tell,

37:54.600 --> 37:57.680
they've got packages supported now with snaps

37:57.680 --> 38:00.180
and other systems that's less relevant,

38:00.180 --> 38:02.760
but it's still relevant to me.

38:02.760 --> 38:05.040
Yeah, the PPAs are the only pain point.

38:05.040 --> 38:08.160
Thank goodness there's so many workarounds around that now.

38:08.160 --> 38:11.320
That's my line too, the line you just drew right there.

38:11.320 --> 38:12.880
It's like, if it's my daily driver

38:12.880 --> 38:15.520
and I'm on that machine as my main workstation,

38:15.520 --> 38:17.320
I actually think it is worth the upgrade.

38:17.320 --> 38:18.620
Normally I would say, no, hold off.

38:18.620 --> 38:20.100
But in this particular case,

38:20.100 --> 38:22.680
the machines I'm going hands-on all the time, I'm upgrading.

38:22.680 --> 38:24.720
And the machines that are more appliances

38:24.720 --> 38:26.080
that I just like the ones here in the studio,

38:26.080 --> 38:27.200
I'm gonna leave on 1904.

38:27.200 --> 38:29.820
Yeah, and then usually if you upgrade at least one machine,

38:29.820 --> 38:31.200
at some point you'll figure out like,

38:31.200 --> 38:32.220
is this really enough better

38:32.220 --> 38:34.640
that I'm frustrated at the LTS release now?

38:34.640 --> 38:36.160
And if not, just leave it.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.400
I am a little annoyed

38:37.400 --> 38:39.680
because when I came back to Ubuntu,

38:39.680 --> 38:42.380
I just wanted to stay on one version for like five years

38:42.380 --> 38:44.000
because there's this weird part of me

38:44.000 --> 38:47.040
that really envies people that just like stick to an LTS

38:47.040 --> 38:48.640
for like the full five years.

38:48.640 --> 38:53.520
Because LTSs, in my opinion, go through like this life cycle.

38:53.520 --> 38:58.400
1804 is just cresting the boring period of the life cycle.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.480
And then it'll ride that for a while

39:00.480 --> 39:02.000
and that sort of like curves down

39:02.000 --> 39:03.320
and gets more and more boring.

39:03.320 --> 39:06.800
And especially as like a 1910 comes out

39:06.800 --> 39:07.640
and stuff like that,

39:07.640 --> 39:09.600
1804 is gonna seem really boring.

39:09.600 --> 39:12.100
And then when 2004 comes out,

39:12.100 --> 39:15.020
like boy, 1804 is gonna seem like a cow.

39:15.020 --> 39:20.020
But then it's sort of like it hits rock bottom around 2004.

39:20.620 --> 39:22.440
And then when 2010 comes out,

39:22.440 --> 39:24.760
it kind of starts to get interesting again.

39:24.760 --> 39:25.800
And then it's like back up,

39:25.800 --> 39:30.000
we're like 1404 and like we're 1604 is right now.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.820
And it's like still people love it.

39:31.820 --> 39:33.640
There's people that are still running 1604

39:33.640 --> 39:35.600
and it works great for them.

39:35.600 --> 39:36.440
And then you know what?

39:36.440 --> 39:37.560
They've got all their stuff set up,

39:37.560 --> 39:40.320
all their PPAs work, all their custom configs work.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.140
Yeah, when you're still in the support cycle,

39:42.140 --> 39:44.000
for the most part, it just works.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.400
I wanted to be that guy.

39:45.400 --> 39:49.120
Shall I offer you a hook to tempt you back to 1804?

39:49.120 --> 39:50.720
Yeah, do it.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.520
So those performance improvements

39:52.520 --> 39:55.440
that you've been able to observe in 1904,

39:55.440 --> 39:56.600
you're enjoying that, right?

39:56.600 --> 39:58.800
I am, especially the non-shell stuff.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.520
Right, so just to be clear

40:00.520 --> 40:02.160
for the benefit of the listeners,

40:02.160 --> 40:04.520
this is not work that Canonical are doing

40:04.520 --> 40:07.800
and holding to our chest, they're not sharing.

40:07.800 --> 40:10.600
This is all work that's going back upstream.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.640
However, some of those patches

40:12.640 --> 40:15.060
haven't completed peer review yet.

40:15.060 --> 40:19.080
So aren't merged into the upstream known project.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.840
And that's why we're carrying them

40:20.840 --> 40:22.880
as vendor patches within Ubuntu.

40:22.880 --> 40:26.360
So we can take advantage of those things now.

40:26.360 --> 40:30.720
That said, all of that hotness is in 1904.

40:30.720 --> 40:34.120
We have already backported it to 1810,

40:34.120 --> 40:38.000
and those patches will be landing in 1804 soon.

40:38.000 --> 40:38.960
How is that possible?

40:38.960 --> 40:40.720
It's a totally different version of Gnome Shell.

40:40.720 --> 40:42.000
Well, it is a different version,

40:42.000 --> 40:46.400
but Daniel Van Vo is a magician and he's making it happen.

40:46.400 --> 40:49.440
He is fixing multiple versions of Gnome Shell.

40:49.440 --> 40:51.140
Yeah, and this is not uncommon

40:51.140 --> 40:52.360
within the desktop team, right?

40:52.360 --> 40:55.320
If you look at some of the applications that we carry,

40:55.320 --> 40:56.560
we have multiple versions

40:56.560 --> 40:58.480
across the current supported releases,

40:58.480 --> 41:00.120
and they will be making patches

41:00.120 --> 41:02.040
that are different patch sets

41:02.040 --> 41:04.000
in order to deliver the same functionality

41:04.000 --> 41:05.800
across versions of applications.

41:05.800 --> 41:10.680
So they're not going to just upgrade 1804 to Gnome 3.3.2,

41:10.680 --> 41:12.000
they're going to patch the version,

41:12.000 --> 41:13.880
like what is it, 3.3.0 or whatever that shipped with?

41:13.880 --> 41:14.960
Yeah, I forget what it is.

41:14.960 --> 41:18.520
Was it 3.3.26 maybe, 3.3.28, something like that?

41:18.520 --> 41:20.360
That kind of boggles my mind a little bit.

41:20.360 --> 41:22.880
That is some work.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.440
That is some serious work.

41:24.440 --> 41:27.840
But it's important because people like sticking on LTSs

41:27.840 --> 41:30.840
and depending upon the LTS

41:30.840 --> 41:33.720
and depending upon which non-LTS you're looking at,

41:33.720 --> 41:36.640
I've mentioned this before, it's between 10 and 20 times

41:36.640 --> 41:40.120
the number of people stick on LTSs than non-LTSs.

41:40.120 --> 41:41.880
And if we said to everyone,

41:41.880 --> 41:43.920
hey, it sucks to be you on the LTS,

41:43.920 --> 41:48.080
we're over here enjoying better performance in non-LTS land,

41:48.080 --> 41:50.480
then our LTS customers would be very unhappy,

41:50.480 --> 41:54.400
or 10 times more of them, very unhappy.

41:54.400 --> 41:55.920
And so it makes total sense

41:55.920 --> 41:58.720
for the patches that can be back ported.

41:58.720 --> 42:00.800
And not all of them can, as Martin said,

42:00.800 --> 42:04.000
some of them are too intrusive and too structural

42:04.000 --> 42:06.680
and can't be back ported to an older release of Nome Shell

42:06.680 --> 42:10.040
or the underpinnings of Nome Shell.

42:10.040 --> 42:11.680
But those that can will be.

42:11.680 --> 42:15.560
And so you don't have to look with envy

42:15.560 --> 42:19.160
at the 1904 users who get all of the performance improvements.

42:19.160 --> 42:21.200
You'll get some of them as well.

42:21.200 --> 42:22.960
Somebody ought to send this episode to management

42:22.960 --> 42:24.760
over at Apple and tell them they can back port

42:24.760 --> 42:27.000
some of their fixes and old versions of Mac OS.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.960
Okay, but MiniMac, you get what I'm saying though, right?

42:28.960 --> 42:31.080
Like there are people that really benefit

42:31.080 --> 42:33.480
from just sticking with the LTS for like a really long time.

42:33.480 --> 42:34.760
I believe you're one of them.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.640
Yeah, in fact, I have one computer

42:36.640 --> 42:40.360
is my working horse desktop that I rarely upgrade.

42:40.360 --> 42:42.280
So it's still running 1604

42:42.280 --> 42:46.280
within an enlightenment E22 desktop.

42:46.280 --> 42:50.280
And I run with enlightenment, some snaps and PPAs,

42:50.280 --> 42:52.720
and that's working really, really great.

42:52.720 --> 42:54.600
So no questions asked.

42:54.600 --> 42:56.560
There's a sentence you don't hear very often

42:56.560 --> 42:57.760
running enlightenment.

42:57.760 --> 42:58.880
Yeah, that's great.

42:58.880 --> 43:01.040
We should get the MiniMac review of enlightenment.

43:01.040 --> 43:02.000
Totally should, yeah.

43:02.000 --> 43:02.840
I haven't used that yet.

43:02.840 --> 43:04.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:04.200 --> 43:09.200
I will change my setup probably during this year

43:09.360 --> 43:13.200
and then I can give you a review of enlightenment desktop.

43:13.200 --> 43:16.320
For me, I think with the multi-monitor setup,

43:16.320 --> 43:18.640
it's still one of the best desktop environments

43:18.640 --> 43:19.960
you can have.

43:19.960 --> 43:21.000
All right, I want that.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.360
I want that, I want you to do that.

43:22.360 --> 43:23.200
I totally want that.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.520
Okay, promised, promised, excellent.

43:25.520 --> 43:26.840
All right, so that's the big question.

43:26.840 --> 43:29.160
And it sounds like, I mean, both Wimby and Popey

43:29.160 --> 43:31.240
are kind of telling me I don't need to upgrade.

43:31.240 --> 43:32.520
And I think we need to,

43:32.520 --> 43:34.360
I would like to give an answer to the audience.

43:34.360 --> 43:36.240
Is it worth upgrading from LTS

43:36.240 --> 43:38.320
and getting back on this upgrade train?

43:38.320 --> 43:42.160
And maybe it's not, if you're willing to wait around

43:42.160 --> 43:43.700
and wait for those, I mean, it'll take time

43:43.700 --> 43:45.480
for those things to get back ported.

43:45.480 --> 43:48.280
But it sounds like maybe it's not worth it yet,

43:48.280 --> 43:50.720
unless you really are a gnome shell enthusiast.

43:50.720 --> 43:53.280
There's pros and cons to staying on the LTS

43:53.280 --> 43:55.240
or jumping on the interims, right?

43:55.240 --> 43:58.800
If you're a Linux enthusiast,

43:58.800 --> 44:02.080
and I imagine most people listening to this are,

44:02.080 --> 44:05.680
then running the latest stuff is always sort of compelling

44:05.680 --> 44:06.520
on what you want to do,

44:06.520 --> 44:08.720
because you want to play with the latest technology

44:08.720 --> 44:10.920
and learn it and tinker with it.

44:10.920 --> 44:13.960
But by the same token, you don't need to do that.

44:13.960 --> 44:16.480
And there are benefits to staying on the LTS

44:16.480 --> 44:20.920
because the LTS is well supported out in the wider world.

44:20.920 --> 44:22.120
Outside of our bubble,

44:22.120 --> 44:26.280
those people that are producing software for Linux

44:26.280 --> 44:29.640
will absolutely produce packages and software for you

44:29.640 --> 44:32.120
for the current LTS version,

44:32.120 --> 44:34.480
not so much for the interim releases.

44:34.480 --> 44:36.840
So it really depends what you need

44:36.840 --> 44:38.520
to get out of your machine.

44:38.520 --> 44:40.720
If you don't need to listen to us for advice,

44:40.720 --> 44:42.440
then yeah, okay, upgrade.

44:42.440 --> 44:46.040
I would say, I think the consensus is,

44:46.040 --> 44:47.160
stick with the LTS

44:47.160 --> 44:49.520
unless you have a compelling reason to upgrade.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.480
If you're a performance hound,

44:51.480 --> 44:53.320
and you really, really care about

44:53.320 --> 44:55.840
the perceived performance of your desktop,

44:55.840 --> 44:58.280
I will say out of the box,

44:58.280 --> 45:00.560
the 1904 implementation is clearly faster.

45:00.560 --> 45:04.520
And I have been doing for about 48 hours,

45:04.520 --> 45:06.360
a little side-by-side GNOME boxes.

45:06.360 --> 45:10.480
I just did a base 1804 install out of the box

45:10.480 --> 45:12.160
and a base 1904.

45:12.160 --> 45:13.280
That's a good little experiment.

45:13.280 --> 45:15.320
Yeah, it was the most up-to-date daily 1904.

45:15.320 --> 45:17.280
No updates though installed on either,

45:17.280 --> 45:20.520
just installed them, rebooted once,

45:20.520 --> 45:23.320
got back to the desktop and then let it ran for 48 hours.

45:23.320 --> 45:24.920
And without a question,

45:24.920 --> 45:26.800
I mean, it's clear just by looking at the charts,

45:26.800 --> 45:30.360
the 1904 version out of the box uses less RAM

45:30.360 --> 45:34.160
and continues to use less RAM the longer GNOME shell runs.

45:34.160 --> 45:35.880
And I'm talking like,

45:35.880 --> 45:38.280
it's a difference of about 500 megabytes of RAM right now,

45:38.280 --> 45:39.680
difference, just sitting there running.

45:39.680 --> 45:40.520
Yikes.

45:40.520 --> 45:41.640
Yeah, so it really, you know,

45:41.640 --> 45:44.200
there is clear advantages to the new release.

45:44.200 --> 45:45.800
That sounds like some of that will be coming back

45:45.800 --> 45:47.800
to the older versions, maybe not all of it.

45:47.800 --> 45:49.320
And if you want it today,

45:49.320 --> 45:51.160
then you basically have to go to 1904.

45:51.160 --> 45:52.520
That's what it comes down to.

45:52.520 --> 45:54.040
If you're willing to wait, then you're good.

45:54.040 --> 45:55.480
Or if you're like me and maybe just gonna switch

45:55.480 --> 45:58.120
to XFCE or Xubuntu, it doesn't matter.

45:58.120 --> 46:00.960
I was, I just can't believe it.

46:00.960 --> 46:03.720
I just, you know, I thought I wanted something sexy.

46:03.720 --> 46:06.600
I thought I wanted a desktop that was like plasma,

46:06.600 --> 46:08.560
that is very, very modern because-

46:08.560 --> 46:10.240
I think you're making a transition here.

46:10.240 --> 46:11.600
I think I am.

46:11.600 --> 46:12.440
I think that's what it is.

46:12.440 --> 46:14.720
You're approaching the desktop a little bit differently.

46:14.720 --> 46:15.560
I think I am.

46:15.560 --> 46:18.120
It's going from like the computer is my video game

46:18.120 --> 46:20.440
and to the computer is my tool.

46:20.440 --> 46:22.760
And I want my tool to be as effective and efficient

46:22.760 --> 46:26.400
and at the best of doing just what I want it to do.

46:26.400 --> 46:28.840
And XFCE is really good for that.

46:29.920 --> 46:32.560
There's one other feature of 1904

46:32.560 --> 46:34.760
that might be worth touching on.

46:34.760 --> 46:36.000
Yeah, tell me about it.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.360
It's a feature in the installer.

46:38.360 --> 46:41.120
So when you run the install now,

46:41.120 --> 46:43.160
one of the tick boxes,

46:43.160 --> 46:44.880
it used to be where it used to say

46:44.880 --> 46:48.320
install third-party codecs and that sort of thing.

46:48.320 --> 46:53.320
That bit of text now says install third-party hardware

46:53.440 --> 46:56.320
drivers for graphics and wifi.

46:56.320 --> 47:00.760
If you have an Nvidia GPU and you tick that box,

47:00.760 --> 47:04.920
it will install the proprietary Nvidia drivers for you

47:04.920 --> 47:08.600
so that you've got Nvidia out of the box on your first boot.

47:09.640 --> 47:10.480
That's great.

47:10.480 --> 47:11.840
That's slick, wow.

47:11.840 --> 47:13.000
Yeah, it's a good release.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.960
It's a really good release.

47:14.960 --> 47:17.560
And I mean, you know, it's not an LTS,

47:17.560 --> 47:20.080
but it is a really good midterm release.

47:20.080 --> 47:21.760
The Yaru theme is sharp.

47:21.760 --> 47:23.240
I really like it.

47:23.240 --> 47:24.360
I installed GNOME tweaks.

47:24.360 --> 47:26.320
I used the dark mode of it, dark version of it,

47:26.320 --> 47:28.060
and I think it looks really good.

47:28.060 --> 47:28.900
I just left it.

47:28.900 --> 47:30.840
I mean, this is probably the least tweaking

47:30.840 --> 47:32.800
and modification I've ever done.

47:32.800 --> 47:36.240
I spent a lot more time setting up XFCE than I did GNOME Shell.

47:36.240 --> 47:38.480
So of course now my XFCE is like super dialed in.

47:38.480 --> 47:39.320
It's really awesome.

47:39.320 --> 47:42.520
I mean, yeah, once it's tuned, you can make it very lovely.

47:42.520 --> 47:44.760
All right, I believe for one last time.

47:44.760 --> 47:50.760
Everybody's doing the distro, distro, distro, distro.

47:50.760 --> 47:57.560
Distro, distro, distro, distro, distro, distro.

47:57.560 --> 47:59.680
Yeah, congratulations to the Canonical team.

47:59.680 --> 48:00.600
They got a great release.

48:00.600 --> 48:03.760
And now we look forward to other distros

48:03.760 --> 48:05.480
that are shipping at GNOME 3.3.2

48:05.480 --> 48:07.360
and see how their implementations stack up.

48:07.360 --> 48:08.840
There'll be a lot of,

48:08.840 --> 48:11.280
this is probably one of the more exciting release cycles

48:11.280 --> 48:12.680
that we've entered in a while

48:12.680 --> 48:14.980
because in a way we're entering a golden age

48:14.980 --> 48:16.120
of GNOME development now.

48:16.120 --> 48:18.800
And I'm really curious to see

48:18.800 --> 48:21.240
what the other distros do with it.

48:21.240 --> 48:22.200
What do you say, Wes?

48:22.200 --> 48:23.320
What do you say?

48:23.320 --> 48:24.720
A couple of picks before we get out of here.

48:24.720 --> 48:25.560
No, let's do it.

48:25.560 --> 48:26.380
We got two picks.

48:26.380 --> 48:27.440
I brought one to the table today

48:27.440 --> 48:28.880
and Wes brought one to the table.

48:28.880 --> 48:33.880
And let's just say, please, ladies and gentlemen,

48:34.000 --> 48:36.560
this next pick that we're about to cover here on the show,

48:36.560 --> 48:39.040
please, please do use it responsibly

48:39.040 --> 48:41.920
because you need to be a good internet citizen.

48:44.060 --> 48:45.520
It's called Party Loud,

48:45.520 --> 48:49.300
a simple tool to generate fake web browsing traffic

48:49.300 --> 48:52.680
and mitigate tracking by essentially blasting web trackers

48:52.680 --> 48:54.160
with a lot of noise.

48:54.160 --> 48:55.680
Oh yeah, that's right.

48:55.680 --> 48:56.720
You got a chance to give it a go.

48:56.720 --> 48:58.960
In fact, we'll have a link to an ASCII video

48:58.960 --> 49:01.640
in the show notes if people wanna see Wes's,

49:01.640 --> 49:02.480
what do you call this?

49:02.480 --> 49:04.200
A spoof session?

49:04.200 --> 49:05.560
A Party Loud session?

49:05.560 --> 49:06.440
Yeah, exactly.

49:06.440 --> 49:09.120
There's a previously, there's a script out there

49:09.120 --> 49:10.720
that's kind of popular, noisy.py,

49:10.720 --> 49:12.200
which was the inspiration for this,

49:12.200 --> 49:14.520
but that's Python, it's a little more complicated.

49:14.520 --> 49:16.280
Party Loud has the advantage of being

49:16.280 --> 49:18.320
pretty much just a simple bash script.

49:18.320 --> 49:20.560
You can and should read it yourself.

49:20.560 --> 49:22.720
And then otherwise it has a list predetermined.

49:22.720 --> 49:25.200
You can add your own of websites, queries,

49:25.200 --> 49:26.360
and then it basically just goes,

49:26.360 --> 49:29.020
spins up a couple of threads with your resolvers,

49:29.020 --> 49:30.480
goes out and pulls a bunch of websites

49:30.480 --> 49:33.800
and walks around on the various URLs that they offer.

49:33.800 --> 49:36.280
And it's like you're doing your own web browsing session.

49:36.280 --> 49:38.080
Nicely too, it does display it for you

49:38.080 --> 49:39.120
so you can see what it's doing,

49:39.120 --> 49:40.640
it's not just off lurking in the background.

49:40.640 --> 49:42.280
That's why I mentioned the ASCII video.

49:42.280 --> 49:44.440
It's pretty cool actually watching it go on

49:44.440 --> 49:46.120
and knock on the doors of all these trackers

49:46.120 --> 49:47.440
and be like, I'm over here, I'm over here,

49:47.440 --> 49:48.480
I'm over here, I'm over here.

49:48.480 --> 49:50.080
It might be convenient too if you just need

49:50.080 --> 49:53.200
some sort of simulated HTTP traffic for a while.

49:53.200 --> 49:56.360
Yeah, yeah, I don't know, yeah, for testing I suppose.

49:56.360 --> 49:58.880
Just be careful where you use it

49:58.880 --> 50:01.680
because it could be kind of network intensive I suppose.

50:01.680 --> 50:04.000
Its default configuration wasn't crazy,

50:04.000 --> 50:06.520
it was like every two seconds and had four or five sites.

50:06.520 --> 50:08.920
But yeah, I'm sure you could tune it to be pretty rough.

50:08.920 --> 50:10.560
Okay, four or five sites, that's not gonna be too bad.

50:10.560 --> 50:11.840
That's not gonna be too bad.

50:11.840 --> 50:13.320
All right, well tell me about,

50:13.320 --> 50:15.760
tell me about, did I, wait, or no, I found this one.

50:15.760 --> 50:17.360
Oh, I thought you found, what?

50:17.360 --> 50:18.440
Maybe we both found it.

50:18.440 --> 50:19.280
Maybe.

50:19.280 --> 50:21.120
Oh, maybe, oh, that's what it was is you linked it to me

50:21.120 --> 50:22.760
and then I added it to my bookmarks

50:22.760 --> 50:26.000
and then I took credit for it, that's what happened.

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
It's called NCSpot and it is an NCurses Spotify client

50:31.000 --> 50:33.280
written in Rust.

50:33.280 --> 50:35.400
I heard all those things and it just screamed Chris to me.

50:35.400 --> 50:37.240
I know, that had to go in the show, right?

50:37.240 --> 50:41.440
It's Spotify on the command line, what else do you need to know?

50:41.440 --> 50:44.240
If you gotta use Spotify, this is the way to do it.

50:44.240 --> 50:47.040
This is so great and NCurses is wonderful.

50:48.200 --> 50:49.760
I don't know how you found this, Wes.

50:49.760 --> 50:51.200
I have not tried this one yet

50:51.200 --> 50:53.360
because I don't know that they have a release.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.640
I think you have to actually have a Rust tool chain installed

50:55.640 --> 50:57.160
and I don't own this laptop.

50:57.160 --> 50:58.720
I just can't.

50:58.720 --> 51:01.800
But I'm sure before long that will change

51:01.800 --> 51:03.440
or maybe you can just get Michael Dominic

51:03.440 --> 51:04.280
to compile it for you.

51:04.280 --> 51:08.480
I do actually think this would be perfect for the studio.

51:08.480 --> 51:11.640
I already want it, yeah, for playing music as well.

51:11.640 --> 51:13.160
We just put my credentials in there

51:13.160 --> 51:15.480
and just let it connect to my Spotify account.

51:15.480 --> 51:17.000
Yeah, that's not bad.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.520
That's pretty cool to have it on the command line

51:18.520 --> 51:21.000
and I'm a sucker for any kind of NCurses you want.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.440
They're just simple, functional and they look good.

51:23.440 --> 51:26.800
Yeah, Spotify on the command line, I can't even.

51:26.800 --> 51:29.080
You know, we ought to get some pics from the audience.

51:29.080 --> 51:31.600
We haven't got, I don't think we've got any for ages.

51:31.600 --> 51:32.440
Help us out.

51:32.440 --> 51:34.920
LinuxUnplugged.com slash contact.

51:34.920 --> 51:37.360
You can send us show feedback but also pick suggestions

51:37.360 --> 51:39.720
or you can tweet Wes or myself at Chris Elias

51:39.720 --> 51:42.720
or me at Wes Payne for him.

51:42.720 --> 51:43.560
I've got a pic.

51:43.560 --> 51:44.400
Yeah, oh, you do?

51:44.400 --> 51:45.440
I'd love to hear it. Amazing.

51:45.440 --> 51:46.400
I do.

51:46.400 --> 51:49.360
Now, don't everyone groan when you hear the name.

51:49.360 --> 51:52.160
Just hear what it does after I tell you the name.

51:52.160 --> 51:53.000
Okay.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.480
This is called Electron Player

51:55.480 --> 51:58.400
and it's, among other things,

51:58.400 --> 52:02.440
it's a Linux desktop Netflix client.

52:02.440 --> 52:03.520
Oh, what?

52:03.520 --> 52:04.520
Can you drop a link to that

52:04.520 --> 52:05.360
and show us what's on the show notes?

52:05.360 --> 52:10.360
Yeah, it's snapcraft.io forward slash electron player.

52:11.440 --> 52:14.680
I spoke to the author a little while ago

52:14.680 --> 52:16.880
and it also does YouTube and float plane

52:16.880 --> 52:18.920
and a couple of other streaming services

52:18.920 --> 52:21.680
but it's got all of the DRM modules baked in

52:21.680 --> 52:24.160
so you can unclutter your browser

52:24.160 --> 52:25.960
and dedicate some screen space

52:25.960 --> 52:29.400
to a desktop client video player.

52:29.400 --> 52:30.240
That's brilliant.

52:30.240 --> 52:31.080
That's great.

52:31.080 --> 52:33.120
That, oh, I love it.

52:33.120 --> 52:34.960
I'm giving that one another ding.

52:34.960 --> 52:35.800
Good pick.

52:35.800 --> 52:36.640
Yeah, we'll throw a link to that

52:36.640 --> 52:37.480
in the show notes right now.

52:37.480 --> 52:38.320
You know what?

52:38.320 --> 52:39.760
I'm gonna take that, Electron Player.

52:39.760 --> 52:41.680
That's a great use for Electron right there, right?

52:41.680 --> 52:43.800
Because you're using web streaming services anyways.

52:43.800 --> 52:44.640
That's a great use case.

52:44.640 --> 52:45.480
It kind of just makes sense.

52:45.480 --> 52:47.320
It does kind of just make sense.

52:47.320 --> 52:48.760
Go check out the Ubuntu podcast.

52:48.760 --> 52:50.720
Go get more Popey, Wimpy, and Mark II

52:50.720 --> 52:53.120
over at ubuntupodcast.org.

52:53.120 --> 52:55.080
You guys want to tease anything for an upcoming episode?

52:55.080 --> 52:56.840
Anything in the works?

52:56.840 --> 52:59.240
Next episode's out in a couple of days.

52:59.240 --> 53:02.800
We're apparently planning an extravaganza for Foss Talk Live

53:02.800 --> 53:04.280
but I've not been completely looped in

53:04.280 --> 53:05.400
on this extravaganza.

53:05.400 --> 53:06.640
The other two have got planned.

53:06.640 --> 53:08.880
So I'm looking forward to finding out

53:08.880 --> 53:09.920
what that's all about.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.560
And of course, both you gentlemen

53:11.560 --> 53:14.720
will be at Linux Fest Northwest in just a few days.

53:14.720 --> 53:15.880
Very exciting. We will.

53:15.880 --> 53:17.840
This time next week we'll be on a plane or something,

53:17.840 --> 53:18.800
I think, Popey and I.

53:18.800 --> 53:20.160
Yeah.

53:20.160 --> 53:21.640
I should be having stern words with him

53:21.640 --> 53:23.920
about GPUs as well.

53:23.920 --> 53:24.920
That's right.

53:24.920 --> 53:27.240
Make sure he never gets that wrong again.

53:27.240 --> 53:28.800
Yeah, when you get here, you got to stop by.

53:28.800 --> 53:30.200
Maybe we'll do dinner or something.

53:30.200 --> 53:31.640
Telegram me when you get in.

53:31.640 --> 53:35.040
I'm going to, I'll be waiting, watching your flights,

53:35.040 --> 53:35.880
tracking you now.

53:35.880 --> 53:36.720
You cannot escape him.

53:36.720 --> 53:40.080
We'll turn tracking on for you, Chris.

53:40.080 --> 53:41.200
Very, very good.

53:41.200 --> 53:43.160
All right, well, that brings us to the end

53:43.160 --> 53:46.600
of this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

53:46.600 --> 53:48.080
Links to everything we talked about

53:48.080 --> 53:49.480
are in your podcast player of choice

53:49.480 --> 53:52.160
over at linuxunplugged.com slash 297.

53:52.160 --> 53:54.320
You can also get the RSS feeds for the show there,

53:54.320 --> 53:57.400
linuxunplugged.com slash subscribe.

53:57.400 --> 53:58.880
What else should we plug?

53:58.880 --> 53:59.880
The Friday wrap up stream.

53:59.880 --> 54:00.720
Mention that again.

54:00.720 --> 54:04.680
Oh yeah, come join us live on Friday, 2 p.m. JB time.

54:04.680 --> 54:07.000
That and this are like the two times

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
I get to see people live.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.080
So come say hi.

54:09.080 --> 54:13.040
You can also hang out here over at jblive.tv.

54:13.040 --> 54:14.480
We do this on a Tuesday.

54:14.480 --> 54:15.800
Go to Jupiterbroadcasting.com

54:15.800 --> 54:18.200
to get that converted to your local time.

54:18.200 --> 54:19.920
Thanks so much for joining us.

54:19.920 --> 54:22.000
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.520
Ah!

54:53.520 --> 55:06.120
So Cheese, I'm curious, what do you think about Linus Tech Tips getting into Linux coverage?

55:06.120 --> 55:08.920
This is like the third or fourth Linux video they've done in a year.

55:08.920 --> 55:10.400
They're getting to, they're doing it more and more.

55:10.400 --> 55:11.400
Yeah.

55:11.400 --> 55:12.400
What do you think, Bacon?

55:12.400 --> 55:13.400
You know, it's kind of interesting.

55:13.400 --> 55:19.240
I have some friends that game on their desktops and use Windows primarily.

55:19.240 --> 55:24.640
And this past week, I guess they caught the video, I didn't plug it to them or anything,

55:24.640 --> 55:27.880
but they caught the video and they were asking me, dude, what's up with Linux?

55:27.880 --> 55:28.880
What is this?

55:28.880 --> 55:29.880
What's this all about?

55:29.880 --> 55:34.320
So I had to kind of give them the quick two minute rundown.

55:34.320 --> 55:35.920
Look at you, ambassador to Linux.

55:35.920 --> 55:36.920
Yeah, right?

55:36.920 --> 55:39.720
Well, and I've been telling them for years, man, that they need to look into it.

55:39.720 --> 55:43.880
But you know, until it revolves around gaming, I guess it doesn't matter to them.

55:43.880 --> 55:49.760
I am both very excited to get more Linux coverage and get more users over and both that and

55:49.760 --> 55:50.760
a little nervous.

55:50.760 --> 55:55.860
That's like, I don't necessarily know if gaming is the real hard sale we want to make.

55:55.860 --> 55:57.360
Come over and emulate your Windows games.

55:57.360 --> 56:01.840
I mean, I know I'm being harsh there, but I just feel like it's not the strongest foot

56:01.840 --> 56:02.840
forward.

56:02.840 --> 56:06.160
Like you want to come over and be a, you know, assistant administrator or developer or learn

56:06.160 --> 56:08.840
to develop, you know, educational stuff.

56:08.840 --> 56:09.840
Like that's great.

56:09.840 --> 56:13.120
I think Google saying that with Stadia, right?

56:13.120 --> 56:18.480
Yeah, it's just as Proton adds compatibility with more Windows games, it naturally opens

56:18.480 --> 56:20.400
it up to a larger audience.

56:20.400 --> 56:24.180
It's just it's sort of selling Linux on something that's getting much, much, much, much better

56:24.180 --> 56:30.120
at and has gotten much better at, but it's not selling it on its absolute strongest,

56:30.120 --> 56:31.120
strongest case.

56:31.120 --> 56:32.120
That's all.

56:32.120 --> 56:33.120
And I just.

56:33.120 --> 56:34.120
Right.

56:34.120 --> 56:37.040
It's hard to be like a really enthusiast evangelist when you're like, but also just to clarify,

56:37.040 --> 56:39.240
this has been a weak spot that it's getting better at.

56:39.240 --> 56:42.000
So it might not be perfect and a lot of stuff doesn't work great.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.720
And when you play that network game that uses DRM, it's probably not going to work quite

56:45.720 --> 56:46.720
right.

56:46.720 --> 56:51.220
And those kinds of things like, at the same time, I'm like, you know, anything that gets

56:51.220 --> 56:56.160
people interested and has them checking it out and downloading an ISO and giving it a

56:56.160 --> 57:02.240
go, you know, maybe for every, for every thousand, for 50 of them to a hundred of them, it sticks.

57:02.240 --> 57:03.240
Even that would be good.

57:03.240 --> 57:04.240
Yeah, absolutely.

57:04.240 --> 57:07.560
And, you know, MSS, they're seeing a bunch of big downloads, so that's great too.

57:07.560 --> 57:11.720
And I mean, gaming has come a long way on Linux, so it's probably good to talk about

57:11.720 --> 57:12.720
it a little more.

57:12.720 --> 57:18.480
And it's also interesting to hear people outside the quote unquote community talk about the

57:18.480 --> 57:19.480
distributions.

57:19.480 --> 57:22.560
Like the way they talk about Ubuntu and the way they talk about Manjaro and the way they

57:22.560 --> 57:23.560
talk about Pop OS.

57:23.560 --> 57:25.400
I find that to be really interesting too.

57:25.400 --> 57:32.240
It's sort of like getting to observe like a scientific experiment as they discover and

57:32.240 --> 57:33.240
learn and explore.

57:33.240 --> 57:35.760
Let's observe the humans as they try out Linux.

57:35.760 --> 57:36.760
Yeah.

57:36.760 --> 57:50.680
They're going to be so happy.
