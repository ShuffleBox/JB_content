WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
So Wes, have you ever owned a Windows phone?

00:02.400 --> 00:05.200
Oh, I was hoping you weren't going to ask me that.

00:05.200 --> 00:07.480
I'm ashamed to say yes.

00:07.480 --> 00:10.700
OK, I mean, it was a significant other at the time.

00:10.700 --> 00:12.580
But there was one in my household.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.280
And I definitely played with it a little.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.960
But you don't have access to it anymore then?

00:15.960 --> 00:17.480
No, although I am curious.

00:17.480 --> 00:20.440
There was some news out this week.

00:20.440 --> 00:23.200
Microsoft, they've just kind of abandoned that whole platform,

00:23.200 --> 00:23.700
right?

00:23.700 --> 00:25.960
But they were producing new phones.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.200
They were still getting sold.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.120
So there's still relatively recent Windows phones

00:30.120 --> 00:30.920
out there.

00:30.920 --> 00:33.140
If you had one on the Lumia-branded smartphones,

00:33.140 --> 00:35.460
which I did, there was already a jailbreak.

00:35.460 --> 00:37.160
So you could actually do something useful

00:37.160 --> 00:39.840
with this unsupported hardware that you've probably

00:39.840 --> 00:42.520
either subsidized or paid directly for.

00:42.520 --> 00:46.240
But now, thanks to actually a secure boot flaw, which

00:46.240 --> 00:48.880
I think is hilarious considering how much work Microsoft put

00:48.880 --> 00:51.800
to making that standard, thanks to that,

00:51.800 --> 00:55.280
now on any Qualcomm-based, which is basically every single one,

00:55.280 --> 00:58.520
any Qualcomm-based Windows phone, there's a jailbreak.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.600
Yeah, I'm sure that devs will be rushing to port ROMs to it.

01:01.600 --> 01:02.920
Yeah, probably not.

01:02.920 --> 01:06.680
But if you have something like an HP Elite X3 or HTC One M8,

01:06.680 --> 01:07.760
I did see that one out.

01:07.760 --> 01:11.360
That was kind of popular, maybe more so on a better operating

01:11.360 --> 01:11.860
system.

01:11.860 --> 01:14.280
But you get what you pay for.

01:14.280 --> 01:20.560
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 283, for January 8, 2019.

01:20.560 --> 01:35.120
Hello, and welcome to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.680
Let's put Chris out to pasture this week.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.640
My name is Wes.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.640
My name is Joe.

01:39.640 --> 01:42.520
Thanks for joining us, Joe, especially since I

01:42.520 --> 01:44.440
know you have a new toy you would probably

01:44.440 --> 01:46.160
rather be playing with.

01:46.160 --> 01:46.880
Yep.

01:46.880 --> 01:47.560
But you're here.

01:47.560 --> 01:48.400
You're helping out.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.480
Chris is traveling.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.600
He's already told us all about his adventures.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.280
But meanwhile, well, there's a whole bunch of community news

01:54.280 --> 01:57.920
to talk about, some big changes planned or not planned

01:57.920 --> 02:00.440
for the upcoming Fedora releases.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.980
And there's a shiny new kernel coming soon

02:02.980 --> 02:06.960
with a brand new major version number.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.360
Then those old GNU projects, they've got releases too.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.720
It's just that time of the year.

02:12.720 --> 02:15.600
And one of them, well, it's that bass shell,

02:15.600 --> 02:17.300
which we all know and love.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.640
Speaking of shells, we had an opportunity

02:19.640 --> 02:22.340
to sit down and talk with one of the developers of the fish

02:22.340 --> 02:25.580
shelf, one of my personal favorite shells.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.120
We've also got a discussion coming up

02:27.120 --> 02:29.880
about with the success of Proton,

02:29.880 --> 02:34.000
are there still problems lurking at the heart of gaming on Linux?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.840
And contributing even more, Joe had a chance

02:36.840 --> 02:40.280
to sit down and get some information about just what's

02:40.280 --> 02:41.480
going on with Adobe.

02:41.480 --> 02:45.440
Is there any chance of Creative Cloud coming to Linux?

02:45.440 --> 02:48.120
But before we get into any of that,

02:48.120 --> 02:49.920
well, we're going to need a little help

02:49.920 --> 02:50.840
from our Mumble Room.

02:50.840 --> 02:53.280
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.000
Hello there.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.400
Hello.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.560
Oh, aren't you guys the best?

02:57.560 --> 02:59.160
All right, let's just get started.

02:59.160 --> 03:03.480
We talked about this back in Linux Unplugged 2.77.

03:03.480 --> 03:08.160
And there was some chatter going on about Fedora 31.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.960
And was it going to be delayed by a half year?

03:09.960 --> 03:13.600
Were they going to break the six month release cycle?

03:13.600 --> 03:16.280
They've been discussing this since November.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.840
Turns out, no, they're not.

03:17.840 --> 03:19.720
Yeah, this was a bit of a surprise, wasn't it?

03:19.720 --> 03:21.760
Because Matthew Miller came on and talked

03:21.760 --> 03:23.760
about all the good reasons they were doing this

03:23.760 --> 03:25.560
with all the retooling and the fact

03:25.560 --> 03:29.960
that they really needed time to just wait for the release

03:29.960 --> 03:32.320
and concentrate on that retooling.

03:32.320 --> 03:35.520
But it seems that maybe they're just

03:35.520 --> 03:38.200
going to have to get on with it and double up their work.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.400
Yeah, as Paul Fried explained, after talking

03:40.400 --> 03:42.040
with the council, as well as some

03:42.040 --> 03:44.720
of the folks who are depending on the cadence,

03:44.720 --> 03:47.120
especially they highlight IoT here,

03:47.120 --> 03:50.080
it was clear we need to look at this option.

03:50.080 --> 03:53.040
But for now, we're not going to have any cadence changes.

03:53.040 --> 03:54.360
There's no changes for cadence.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.200
There's no objective requirements from them.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.560
Unless more specific reasons are given,

03:58.560 --> 04:01.040
we're not adopting this at this time, which, OK.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.000
It did seem like there was a little discussion

04:03.000 --> 04:06.560
about, clearly, there's a lot of underpinnings in just how

04:06.560 --> 04:09.520
Fedora gets made, the build processes, the CICD

04:09.520 --> 04:12.200
infrastructure, all the stuff behind the scenes.

04:12.200 --> 04:15.200
I know there were particularly concerns about unblocking

04:15.200 --> 04:17.280
more community management, tying it

04:17.280 --> 04:18.880
less to maybe some specific resources

04:18.880 --> 04:21.520
that just Fedora team members have.

04:21.520 --> 04:23.560
That's all important work.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.480
I guess there just wasn't enough of an argument

04:25.480 --> 04:27.320
about really breaking from the release cycle,

04:27.320 --> 04:29.400
because even though it's not always perfect,

04:29.400 --> 04:31.320
it is something a lot of people depend on.

04:31.320 --> 04:33.720
Well, this does go to show that Fedora does everything

04:33.720 --> 04:36.320
in the open, including making major decisions like this.

04:36.320 --> 04:37.300
It was proposed.

04:37.300 --> 04:38.680
There was a lot of support for it.

04:38.680 --> 04:40.120
We thought it was going to happen.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.640
But ultimately, there was discussion,

04:42.640 --> 04:45.240
and the consensus was against it.

04:45.240 --> 04:47.040
I suppose this kind of thing would probably

04:47.040 --> 04:48.400
happen in quite a lot of projects,

04:48.400 --> 04:50.360
certainly in proprietary software,

04:50.360 --> 04:51.800
and we'd just never hear about it.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.320
Yeah, that's a great point, right?

04:53.320 --> 04:55.480
If it was in a private company, and we

04:55.480 --> 04:56.360
didn't hear about the first part,

04:56.360 --> 04:57.640
well, we would have never heard about it.

04:57.640 --> 05:01.440
It would have just been released and no news story.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.840
It also goes to show that Fedora, well, they

05:03.840 --> 05:06.240
don't stand still, and that's a good thing, right?

05:06.240 --> 05:09.120
There's a lot of great innovations coming from Fedora.

05:09.120 --> 05:13.120
This next story is maybe an area where they're playing catch-up.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.580
So we've already talked about all the data collection,

05:15.580 --> 05:17.040
and Linux for a long time has kind of

05:17.040 --> 05:20.360
been an environment where you had a little bit of privacy

05:20.360 --> 05:21.680
on your desktop.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.640
There was a big hullabaloo about Ubuntu adding more data

05:24.640 --> 05:27.960
collection to the installer, and now Fedora developers

05:27.960 --> 05:31.640
are looking at implementing a per-system UUID identifier

05:31.640 --> 05:35.480
leveraged exclusively by DNF, their package manager,

05:35.480 --> 05:38.100
in order to more accurately count their user base.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.480
So what do you think about this?

05:39.480 --> 05:41.520
Do you think that the controversy is justified,

05:41.520 --> 05:44.360
or do you think that there's nothing to see here,

05:44.360 --> 05:45.240
move along?

05:45.240 --> 05:47.720
My mature opinion after thinking about it for a while

05:47.720 --> 05:49.260
is going to have to be the second one,

05:49.260 --> 05:51.680
but I think it's a question worth asking.

05:51.680 --> 05:54.680
I don't think it's nonsense to bring up the topic.

05:54.680 --> 05:56.920
I think the way that they've implemented it

05:56.920 --> 05:59.640
seems like it's going to be OK, though.

05:59.640 --> 06:02.440
They're not reusing these UUIDs.

06:02.440 --> 06:05.560
Their intention is not to try to identify you as a user.

06:05.560 --> 06:06.860
Mostly, they've seen a lot of problems

06:06.860 --> 06:08.880
of trying to count stuff like, you know,

06:08.880 --> 06:10.960
if you install six-piece copies of Fedora

06:10.960 --> 06:13.440
behind a gnat at your house, well, that counts as one,

06:13.440 --> 06:16.080
even if it was your roommate installing that.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.280
They've also added a couple controls around,

06:18.280 --> 06:20.000
is this just like a short-lived environment,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.400
something like a container, versus an actual,

06:22.400 --> 06:24.600
maybe a server install or a desktop workstation?

06:24.600 --> 06:26.760
That all seems like data that would help them a lot,

06:26.760 --> 06:29.280
and personally, I'm OK giving up.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.320
Yeah, I don't have any problem with this,

06:31.320 --> 06:34.560
and I think they kind of deserve the metrics, don't they?

06:34.560 --> 06:37.600
If you're working hard at making an operating system,

06:37.600 --> 06:39.840
you kind of want to know how many people are using it.

06:39.840 --> 06:43.240
It's like counting the download numbers for a podcast.

06:43.240 --> 06:46.000
We know roughly how many people download the shows that we do,

06:46.000 --> 06:49.280
but we have no idea about any of the people

06:49.280 --> 06:51.840
unless they write in specifically to talk to us.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.880
And I do trust Fedora to do this properly.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.200
They will do it all in the open, and they'll

06:57.200 --> 06:59.240
make sure that this data isn't misused,

06:59.240 --> 07:02.680
but then they can actually use it to do good things,

07:02.680 --> 07:05.960
like concentrate on the areas where the users are,

07:05.960 --> 07:08.280
and potentially even concentrate on areas

07:08.280 --> 07:10.360
where they want to get new users.

07:10.360 --> 07:13.280
Yeah, right, that is sort of the flip side is that you have

07:13.280 --> 07:15.160
good metrics about what people are using

07:15.160 --> 07:18.200
or what user bases are growing that

07:18.200 --> 07:20.320
can help the limited resources that are available

07:20.320 --> 07:21.280
for development.

07:21.280 --> 07:25.000
Yeah, and it's a shame to see so much controversy about it.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.520
People will just get up in arms about anything, won't they?

07:27.520 --> 07:30.120
Yes, they will.

07:30.120 --> 07:34.600
They also get rather excited about just about anything,

07:34.600 --> 07:37.320
and that's probably going to be true about the upcoming Linux

07:37.320 --> 07:40.800
release, Linux 5.0.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.200
Yeah, this was going to be 4.21.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.200
I thought it was actually going to be the 4.20,

07:46.200 --> 07:49.520
but it seems that they wanted to 4.20 represent.

07:49.520 --> 07:55.160
So yeah, Linus has decided that 4.21 will actually now be 5.0.

07:55.160 --> 07:58.400
And there's quite a lot that's actually gone into this

07:58.400 --> 08:01.120
or that's going to be going into it, quite a lot of graphics

08:01.120 --> 08:02.360
stuff specifically.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.480
Oh, yeah, there is a lot of graphics changes.

08:04.480 --> 08:07.520
I also noticed that the Raspberry Pi touch display is

08:07.520 --> 08:08.720
finally getting mainlined.

08:08.720 --> 08:09.920
Hey, that's nice to see.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.800
Yeah, that's long overdue, but yeah, good to see now.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.120
The other one that stood out to me

08:14.120 --> 08:18.000
is this new large version of the Terminus console font

08:18.000 --> 08:20.080
that you can optionally compile in.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.600
That's going to be useful if you've

08:21.600 --> 08:24.000
got one of those fancy high DPI displays,

08:24.000 --> 08:25.560
and you'd actually like to be able to use

08:25.560 --> 08:27.120
the regular terminal before you get

08:27.120 --> 08:28.480
to your graphical environment.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.840
No, I wouldn't know about those high DPI displays, Wes.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.880
No, I wouldn't, but that's one of those reasons, right?

08:33.880 --> 08:35.560
It's not quite working well enough,

08:35.560 --> 08:38.800
and since we are something of a terminal forward operating

08:38.800 --> 08:41.200
system, it's nice to see this somewhat first class.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.520
That's true, but I think there are other high DPI

08:43.520 --> 08:45.080
concerns before that.

08:45.080 --> 08:48.000
Oh, that's true, but this one's a low hanging fruit.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.080
The other good part that probably needed

08:50.080 --> 08:52.840
to get some work seen in general is

08:52.840 --> 08:55.520
work to remove some of the performance hits from Spectre

08:55.520 --> 08:57.240
and meltdown bug mitigation.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.680
In particular, some of the network performance problems

08:59.680 --> 09:02.200
that came from Google's retpoline fix.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.400
That's just going to be good.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.560
I mean, as long as security isn't compromised,

09:06.560 --> 09:09.160
we'd like it to be both secure and fast.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.900
Have we had a kernel release since the beginning

09:11.900 --> 09:14.800
of last year that hasn't had some sort of mitigations in it?

09:14.800 --> 09:18.080
If so, it was there were pretty few and far between.

09:18.080 --> 09:21.080
And I imagine 2019 is going to just be more of the same.

09:21.080 --> 09:23.240
Yeah, but it's very arbitrary, isn't it?

09:23.240 --> 09:25.840
As Linus says, it's really just he

09:25.840 --> 09:28.400
ran out of fingers and toes to count the number on,

09:28.400 --> 09:30.720
and that's why he iterated it up to five.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.480
But there is something psychological about that,

09:33.480 --> 09:34.120
isn't there?

09:34.120 --> 09:37.000
When the new distros come out with a 5.0, anything

09:37.000 --> 09:39.680
with 4.0, whatever, it's going to seem old and crusty.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.840
Yes, it will.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.920
And especially, I mean, the kernel

09:42.920 --> 09:44.600
has just had such an interesting history.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.960
There was the two days which lasted just forever,

09:47.960 --> 09:50.240
and now we're burning through version numbers.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.120
I think for us people familiar with it,

09:52.120 --> 09:53.160
it doesn't really matter.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.000
Once you realize it doesn't really matter,

09:55.000 --> 09:56.760
you just pay attention to the release notes

09:56.760 --> 09:59.160
and what's going on with the kernel, you'll be fine.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.380
Outsiders, though, it might be a little bit confusing,

10:01.380 --> 10:03.320
especially things keep changing.

10:03.320 --> 10:05.140
We have the Chrome-style version numbers.

10:05.140 --> 10:08.560
We have more semantic versioning style,

10:08.560 --> 10:10.560
and then other projects are just all over the place.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.440
You know which project I love for version numbers?

10:13.440 --> 10:15.640
System D. It's just so straightforward.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.240
It's just a whole number, and it just

10:17.240 --> 10:18.800
keeps going up and up and up.

10:18.800 --> 10:22.120
No points, releases, no confusion.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.840
It's just whatever the number is, add one to it.

10:24.840 --> 10:29.680
Yeah, that's a system even I can understand.

10:29.680 --> 10:32.080
Yeah, that's the one good thing about System D.

10:32.080 --> 10:35.640
Ooh, Joe, ouch.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.600
OK, well, speaking of confusion, we've

10:38.600 --> 10:42.920
got a little update from the corrections department today.

10:42.920 --> 10:46.200
Yeah, so on the last episode, which I was nothing

10:46.200 --> 10:47.360
to do with whatsoever.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.640
Didn't touch it one bit.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.320
No, no.

10:49.320 --> 10:52.800
You talked about this blog post on the Clear Linux blog

10:52.800 --> 10:55.280
that was written by Aiki and Aoki,

10:55.280 --> 10:57.720
and talking about how Clear Linux was going

10:57.720 --> 10:59.480
to go and concentrate on the desktop

10:59.480 --> 11:02.440
and have all this remote desktop stuff.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.920
And you guys got pretty excited about that,

11:04.920 --> 11:07.540
specifically because Chris had been tipping Clear

11:07.540 --> 11:09.720
Linux to be the next big thing.

11:09.720 --> 11:13.720
Well, it turns out that blog post was a couple of days old.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.320
Was it maybe a few hundred days old?

11:16.320 --> 11:22.160
Yeah, I mean, published April 22, 2016.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.920
Right, so yeah, almost three years ago.

11:24.920 --> 11:28.320
Yeah, after that in 2017, they switched to Gnome, obviously,

11:28.320 --> 11:31.200
as we know from using it and reviewing it.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.240
Yeah, so that's not very good of us, really.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.000
That was kind of all of our faults.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.960
Chris said that we can throw him under the bus

11:37.960 --> 11:40.600
because he is ultimately responsible.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.280
But really, I'm going to blame Maurice Quarbek because someone

11:43.280 --> 11:44.040
sent it to him.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.280
He sent it to me.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.000
I posted it in our Slack.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.940
You guys read it and then talked about it.

11:49.940 --> 11:52.200
And along that whole chain, nobody

11:52.200 --> 11:53.400
stopped to look at the date.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.540
So it's quite embarrassing, really.

11:55.540 --> 11:58.240
It very much is, and something we try very hard

11:58.240 --> 11:59.440
not to have happen.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.640
And generally, we have a chain of trust, right?

12:01.640 --> 12:04.200
And we only refer links that you've at least somewhat read

12:04.200 --> 12:06.320
or vetted or thought this might be interested.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.560
And this time, no one did it.

12:08.560 --> 12:11.720
It had been discussed that there was excitement around it,

12:11.720 --> 12:13.000
and that was too much for us.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.120
So we're sorry about that.

12:15.120 --> 12:18.240
And I just appreciate the corrections on it, though.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.360
We want to be accurate, and we want to make mistakes.

12:20.360 --> 12:21.920
Well, we've got to own it.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.840
I will also say, a lot of the stuff

12:23.840 --> 12:26.720
that it talked about in the article, XFCE things,

12:26.720 --> 12:28.560
that's maybe the silver lining here

12:28.560 --> 12:32.840
is XFCE still does make a great remote server desktop.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.000
Yeah, it does.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.400
I think from now on, you're going

12:36.400 --> 12:37.880
to have to write some sort of script

12:37.880 --> 12:39.480
to check all these links, go through and grab

12:39.480 --> 12:40.440
the date or something.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.600
You know, that was kind of my instinct as well,

12:42.600 --> 12:45.520
just like a link verify or something, a procedure

12:45.520 --> 12:48.920
to go through and make sure we're always up to date.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.760
Well, you've probably noticed, dear audience,

12:50.760 --> 12:52.400
that Joe stepped in today.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.680
And we're very grateful.

12:53.680 --> 12:56.640
That's because Chris, well, he's on the road.

12:56.640 --> 13:00.080
And once again, you can follow right along.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.400
If you go to our show notes, linuxunplugged.com,

13:02.400 --> 13:06.440
slash 283, you'll find a link to the Rover tracker.

13:06.440 --> 13:08.600
That lets you be as creepy as you like.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.840
Surprise Chris while he's out shopping or just trying

13:10.840 --> 13:12.080
to live his life, no, no.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.360
But it will help you find out where he is.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.320
Follow along.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.480
He's tweeting updates, real cute updates

13:16.480 --> 13:17.680
with some Levi pictures.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.400
So go check those out too.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.800
Yeah, he's in California at the moment.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.360
And I'm very jealous because the weather's probably

13:22.360 --> 13:24.000
a lot better than it is here.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.720
You know, I'm sure it is.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.440
I'm trying to get back at him in my own small way,

13:28.440 --> 13:30.800
though, for abandoning us in the rain and the drizzle

13:30.800 --> 13:32.560
and the cold.

13:32.560 --> 13:35.760
And that's because, as you know, Chris is something of a nano

13:35.760 --> 13:36.560
fan.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.880
And I just can't abide that.

13:37.880 --> 13:40.240
I mean, we're all welcome to our editors, of course.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.320
But that's just an intrinsic free choice

13:42.320 --> 13:43.800
that we all have inside of us.

13:43.800 --> 13:48.760
But when you have workstations that don't have Vim on them,

13:48.760 --> 13:49.560
kind of upsets me.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.080
So while he's been away, I've been

13:51.080 --> 13:53.400
making sure every darn computer in this place

13:53.400 --> 13:54.600
has Vim installed.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.280
So I was thinking about editors, right?

13:56.280 --> 13:59.080
And I just, I'm faster at it.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.960
How do you get to the bottom of a file in nano?

14:00.960 --> 14:02.920
Am I just like paging down like an animal?

14:02.920 --> 14:04.040
I just don't get it.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.000
You know, I've got a great idea, Wes.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.160
While you're installing it, alias nano to Vim.

14:09.160 --> 14:11.280
Oh, that's evil.

14:11.280 --> 14:14.240
I'm not sure he would forgive me on that one.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.520
Thankfully, he could figure it out and fix it himself.

14:16.520 --> 14:17.320
Yeah, true.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.920
Although, how would he edit the config file?

14:20.920 --> 14:23.480
I think at least he's got a GUI on these machines,

14:23.480 --> 14:26.600
so he could probably pull up everyone's favorite, Kate.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.360
No, gedit.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.440
That's everyone's favorite.

14:28.440 --> 14:29.560
Oh, yeah, gedit.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.160
Timeless classic.

14:31.160 --> 14:35.400
Speaking of timeless classics, another recent release

14:35.400 --> 14:36.800
caught my eye.

14:36.800 --> 14:41.640
And that's GNU-Ed 1.15.

14:41.640 --> 14:44.400
As you probably already know, or probably don't,

14:44.400 --> 14:46.840
Ed is a line-oriented text editor.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.340
It's used to create, display, modify, and otherwise manipulate

14:49.340 --> 14:51.720
text files if you're a sadist.

14:51.720 --> 14:55.240
Now, of course, no one really uses Ed anymore unless you're

14:55.240 --> 14:57.320
in a very particular, maybe an embedded environment.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.680
But I'm sure there are thousands of shell scripts out there

15:00.680 --> 15:02.280
that still make use of it in some way

15:02.280 --> 15:04.920
and have been ported from a legacy Unix environment

15:04.920 --> 15:07.520
and probably still work.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.920
Well, should I be embarrassed that I'd never heard of this

15:09.920 --> 15:11.200
until you put it in the show, doc?

15:11.200 --> 15:13.080
You know, honestly, I don't think you should.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.160
It just won't come up.

15:14.160 --> 15:17.760
It's an interesting piece of Unix history and trivia,

15:17.760 --> 15:19.640
still getting updates to this day.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.800
But you would just never have any occasion

15:21.800 --> 15:24.760
to use it, especially these days with rich text editors.

15:24.760 --> 15:27.040
You probably do a bunch of composition on a website.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.760
So Ed is about the complete opposite.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.480
It's not the only GNU release, though, is it?

15:31.480 --> 15:33.800
No, no, it's not, Joe.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.200
This one, I think you probably have heard of.

15:36.200 --> 15:40.000
It's the Bash shell, the born-again shell,

15:40.000 --> 15:43.920
a complete implementation of the POSIX shell spec.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.440
5.0, they've got a bunch of new, interesting supported

15:46.440 --> 15:46.920
variables.

15:46.920 --> 15:50.040
A lot of people had actually been using Bash compiled

15:50.040 --> 15:52.680
before the official release because some distributions

15:52.680 --> 15:55.800
wanted these features, which that's understandable.

15:55.800 --> 15:56.800
But now they're official.

15:56.800 --> 15:57.300
They're out.

15:57.300 --> 15:58.560
You can go get it.

15:58.560 --> 16:01.480
They've got some nice new substitution variables.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.800
The random variable works pretty nicely these days.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.920
Every time you call it, you get a new random number.

16:05.920 --> 16:06.840
Hey, that's nice.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.120
And I think it's just nice to see

16:08.120 --> 16:11.240
that such a fundamental tool that makes up,

16:11.240 --> 16:14.880
even in the days of containers running

16:14.880 --> 16:18.240
on virtual infrastructure as functions that

16:18.240 --> 16:20.040
live for like 10 seconds, there's

16:20.040 --> 16:22.840
still a whole bunch of Bash in like half of those.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.820
Yeah, but common ways, who is still using Bash at this point?

16:25.820 --> 16:27.760
I think a lot of people.

16:27.760 --> 16:33.080
As a, let's say, prosumer on the desktop, shell switching,

16:33.080 --> 16:35.200
it can be something that's pretty fun and useful.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.720
But when you're in the admin server side,

16:37.720 --> 16:40.960
there's a lot of pressure against that sort of thing,

16:40.960 --> 16:42.960
mostly because, well, Bash is everywhere.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.800
It's already installed.

16:44.800 --> 16:48.840
I think that's less of a problem now that Linux is kind of one.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.760
There's a homogeneity about the marketplace

16:50.760 --> 16:54.080
that you might not have had in the days of Solaris or HPUX

16:54.080 --> 16:57.440
or any of the other bigger Unix distributions.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.680
But if you're just a user, maybe you're just a developer,

17:00.680 --> 17:02.720
you don't have root on a bunch of these boxes,

17:02.720 --> 17:04.360
Bash is going to be the shell you have,

17:04.360 --> 17:06.080
so you probably have to know it.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.400
Yeah, I mean, I was only joking, really.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.120
The thing is, it's ubiquitous, isn't it?

17:09.120 --> 17:12.360
It's even on Macs and on the Windows subsystem for Linux.

17:12.360 --> 17:13.880
It's just everywhere, Bash.

17:13.880 --> 17:16.240
Yeah, and there are some more minimal shells,

17:16.240 --> 17:20.280
things like Dash, of course, classic SH that you could use.

17:20.280 --> 17:23.640
But I think we're stuck with Bash for the time being.

17:23.640 --> 17:26.320
But you don't have to be on your own.

17:26.320 --> 17:29.520
And I don't frequently change shells on servers,

17:29.520 --> 17:31.760
unless it's a server I either use all the time

17:31.760 --> 17:33.560
or use very infrequently.

17:33.560 --> 17:37.160
But for home machines, if I'm doing some processing,

17:37.160 --> 17:39.160
if I'm really getting some work done

17:39.160 --> 17:41.160
and I need some specific Bash-isms

17:41.160 --> 17:43.120
or I just know how to do that really well in Bash,

17:43.120 --> 17:44.680
well, it's one command away.

17:44.680 --> 17:45.880
You just type, whatever your shell,

17:45.880 --> 17:48.680
you just type Bash and hit Enter and you've got a Bash shell.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.760
That's why on a lot of my machines,

17:50.760 --> 17:53.160
well, I'm running the Fish shell.

17:53.160 --> 17:55.720
And as rightly pointed out by many people,

17:55.720 --> 17:58.200
Fish, it's not POSIX compliant.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.280
It does things a little bit differently.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.720
And for the old guard, you might not be comfortable with it

18:02.720 --> 18:04.160
because it'll break a lot of assumptions.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.960
But I think for someone new,

18:06.960 --> 18:08.160
someone you're trying to get on Linux,

18:08.160 --> 18:09.600
maybe they're interested in learning a little bit

18:09.600 --> 18:10.440
about the command line,

18:10.440 --> 18:11.880
maybe they're interested in development

18:11.880 --> 18:13.880
or learning administration, anything like that.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.040
They just wanna play with their computer,

18:15.040 --> 18:17.440
but they haven't had 10 years

18:17.440 --> 18:19.240
of using a command line before.

18:19.240 --> 18:20.880
Fish really is friendly.

18:20.880 --> 18:22.600
It's called the Friendly Interactive Shell.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.440
And I think that really does live up to that.

18:24.440 --> 18:28.720
You've got stuff like easy history searching automatically.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.520
It's also got like smart directory memory.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.760
So it knows if you run a command frequently

18:32.760 --> 18:34.000
inside a certain path,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.640
well, that command will just surface up automatically.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.880
I'm curious, Joe, do you use Fish at all?

18:38.880 --> 18:43.160
I have tried it before and I did find it very useful,

18:43.160 --> 18:46.280
but it's not something that really stuck with me.

18:46.280 --> 18:49.840
I think that it's just a case of Bash is just there.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.920
It's always there no matter what machine you're on

18:52.920 --> 18:56.520
and that extra little step to get Fish installed

18:56.520 --> 18:57.840
is just a bit of a blocker.

18:57.840 --> 18:58.920
I just forget to do it.

18:58.920 --> 19:02.160
And then I just haven't got into the rhythm of using it.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.600
But you've kind of pushed over that hump, haven't you?

19:04.600 --> 19:07.400
And it's kind of your daily driver shell.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.400
Once you get used to it,

19:08.400 --> 19:10.440
it's not on all of my machines, as I said,

19:10.440 --> 19:14.960
but for just like simple common command line tasks,

19:14.960 --> 19:17.240
it's really hard to beat because it is friendly.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.080
It'll remember commands.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.200
So if you haven't taken the time

19:19.200 --> 19:20.960
to make a whole bunch of complicated aliases

19:20.960 --> 19:24.320
on that machine, it's got your back on those.

19:24.320 --> 19:27.280
And well, it just had a release.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.040
This was just at the end of December,

19:29.040 --> 19:33.960
right before the new year, Fish 300 was released.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.680
Now there's some backwards incompatibility.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.520
So you're gonna wanna go read the release notes

19:38.520 --> 19:40.600
if you're a big Fish shell user.

19:40.600 --> 19:43.280
That said, they obviously have their eye on stability.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.200
So those are just kind of only the things

19:45.200 --> 19:46.360
they had to change.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.680
There's also some good news.

19:47.680 --> 19:50.280
A lot of people as someone in the IRC

19:50.280 --> 19:53.480
just pointed out, previously Fish wouldn't let you use

19:53.480 --> 19:57.000
double ampersand for like an and command

19:57.000 --> 19:58.760
as you would traditionally do with the bash shell.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.640
They wanted you to use the literal word and,

20:01.640 --> 20:02.600
they've added that syntax.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.500
So there's actually a lot of new changes

20:04.500 --> 20:08.420
that are really friendly for people coming from POSIX.

20:08.420 --> 20:11.720
So I think now is probably a better time than ever

20:11.720 --> 20:15.080
to talk about Fish shell and to give it a try.

20:15.080 --> 20:18.580
Because of that, we were lucky enough to be joined

20:18.580 --> 20:21.480
by Peter, one of the developers of the Fish shell.

20:21.480 --> 20:25.040
He came on and chatted with Chris and I before Chris left.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.040
Let's hear a little bit more from that.

20:27.040 --> 20:29.360
Anybody who's listened to Linux Unplugged for a long time

20:29.360 --> 20:32.360
knows that Wes and I are both daily drivers

20:32.360 --> 20:33.200
of the Fish shell.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.460
We love Fish.

20:35.460 --> 20:37.700
And we wanted to bring on one of the core members

20:37.700 --> 20:39.480
of the project to just talk about a little bit

20:39.480 --> 20:40.720
after their new release.

20:40.720 --> 20:42.640
Peter, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.960
Thanks Chris, it's great to be here.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.960
Oh no, no, thank you for making it.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.800
Especially sort of last minute when this just crossed

20:47.800 --> 20:49.360
your mind after the new release.

20:49.360 --> 20:50.820
But I thought, Peter, instead of me

20:50.820 --> 20:52.520
saying it in any kind of ham-fisted way

20:52.520 --> 20:55.560
that I might explain it, from your own words,

20:55.560 --> 20:57.280
how do you describe Fish shell?

20:57.280 --> 20:58.880
What is the Fish shell?

20:58.880 --> 20:59.960
Sure.

20:59.960 --> 21:04.320
So Fish is a command line shell like Bash.

21:04.320 --> 21:07.880
If you are a Mac user and you launch the Terminal app or iTerm

21:07.880 --> 21:12.440
or you're a Linux user, you launch Xterm or Kitty

21:12.440 --> 21:16.480
or whatever, you have a program which draws the window frame

21:16.480 --> 21:18.360
and it has some text in it, renders the text.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.320
And that's called the Terminal emulator.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.720
And the shell is the program running

21:22.720 --> 21:26.160
inside the Terminal emulator that will receive the text

21:26.160 --> 21:27.760
that you input and then, based on that,

21:27.760 --> 21:29.160
decide what commands to run.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.960
So a lot of users are initially confused

21:30.960 --> 21:33.120
about the distinction between the Terminal emulator

21:33.120 --> 21:34.320
and the shell.

21:34.320 --> 21:38.000
And Fish occupies the same space as Bash, as Zshell,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.480
as some other ones like TCH.

21:40.480 --> 21:41.440
I like that explanation.

21:41.440 --> 21:44.920
That's probably much better than the one I would have given.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.040
No kidding.

21:46.040 --> 21:49.160
So I guess I have to ask you the biggest question on my mind.

21:49.160 --> 21:52.440
And that is, how do you get people to use Fish shell?

21:52.440 --> 21:54.640
Because everybody's just got Bash by default now.

21:54.640 --> 21:57.880
Bash is sort of the default, and default is sort of supreme.

21:57.880 --> 22:01.640
And Fish shell is an alternative to that.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.960
And in most cases, or maybe in a lot of cases at least,

22:03.960 --> 22:07.640
people might not even be aware that they can switch a shell.

22:07.640 --> 22:10.760
So how does Fish shell fit in with that?

22:10.760 --> 22:11.560
How does that work?

22:11.560 --> 22:12.400
How does that?

22:12.400 --> 22:15.440
I guess the better way to put that is,

22:15.440 --> 22:19.560
how do you feel about the fact that Bash may always

22:19.560 --> 22:22.080
remain dominant and supreme?

22:22.080 --> 22:24.160
And some people may not even know they can switch.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.520
Does that affect the way you work on the project?

22:26.520 --> 22:27.680
Does that affect you in any way?

22:27.680 --> 22:29.520
That seems like a major elephant in the room

22:29.520 --> 22:30.640
with a project like this.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.080
Yeah, that's a great question.

22:33.080 --> 22:37.200
Driving adoption is certainly a challenge for our project.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.640
For the reason you said, Bash is very entrenched.

22:39.640 --> 22:42.360
And shells are like text editors.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.720
They're very personal.

22:44.720 --> 22:48.880
When you develop a lot of techniques and muscle memory

22:48.880 --> 22:55.000
to use these tools day to day, that

22:55.000 --> 22:56.880
makes it a challenge to switch, because when

22:56.880 --> 22:59.360
you try a new project, it feels unfamiliar, right?

22:59.360 --> 23:03.200
The things you're used to don't work.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.960
None of your muscle memory applies or less of it

23:04.960 --> 23:07.120
applies, and there are surprises.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.640
And so one of the ways that we try

23:09.640 --> 23:11.200
to address that in the Fish shell

23:11.200 --> 23:14.840
is we try to identify the features that users miss

23:14.840 --> 23:17.280
from Bash the most, and then we add them in.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.200
And we're conservative about that.

23:19.200 --> 23:22.760
We do that slowly, but that's one of the ways

23:22.760 --> 23:26.080
that we can help make users feel more comfortable initially.

23:26.080 --> 23:29.240
It also helps that Bash is missing out

23:29.240 --> 23:31.320
on a lot of user-friendly features, features

23:31.320 --> 23:33.920
that are part of the Fish shell.

23:33.920 --> 23:36.000
We say that the Fish shell is a command line

23:36.000 --> 23:38.080
shell for the 90s.

23:38.080 --> 23:41.440
That illustrates that in a lot of ways,

23:41.440 --> 23:43.280
command line shells are stuck in the past,

23:43.280 --> 23:45.640
but we think that Bash is a command line

23:45.640 --> 23:47.480
shell from the 80s.

23:47.480 --> 23:49.760
It doesn't have features like syntax highlighting.

23:49.760 --> 23:53.840
It doesn't have features like autocompletion and so forth.

23:53.840 --> 23:57.240
So one of the ways that users learn about the Fish shell

23:57.240 --> 23:59.480
is they just see it on other people's screens,

23:59.480 --> 24:00.320
on other users' screens.

24:00.320 --> 24:02.120
They're like, wow, that looks really cool.

24:02.120 --> 24:02.880
How can I get that?

24:02.880 --> 24:04.160
And it spreads by word of mouth.

24:04.160 --> 24:07.640
Yeah, that has definitely been my experience,

24:07.640 --> 24:09.680
not only how I found it, but how others have found it

24:09.680 --> 24:11.320
after they saw it on my screen.

24:11.320 --> 24:15.240
And you described it as it's a personal thing.

24:15.240 --> 24:17.120
I used the word when I was chatting with Wes

24:17.120 --> 24:18.080
before we sat down.

24:18.080 --> 24:21.280
It's also maybe the most intimate software

24:21.280 --> 24:23.920
I use on my computer, because I'm not just interacting with it

24:23.920 --> 24:25.040
and clicking it.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.320
I'm communicating with it.

24:26.320 --> 24:27.800
Yeah, it sees everything that you run,

24:27.800 --> 24:29.520
and it enables you to use your machine.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.760
And there's not much software these days

24:31.760 --> 24:35.640
that I have a very strong emotional opinion about,

24:35.640 --> 24:38.720
where you could use language like love,

24:38.720 --> 24:41.360
as for how strongly I love Fish shell.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.960
I really feel strongly about it.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.000
I don't feel that way about a lot of software anymore,

24:46.000 --> 24:47.320
but Fish shell is still one of them.

24:47.320 --> 24:50.040
And so there's something special about building a shell.

24:50.040 --> 24:53.720
So the project's been around now, what, since 2005?

24:53.720 --> 24:55.540
The project is around since 2005.

24:55.540 --> 24:56.880
That was the first release.

24:56.880 --> 25:00.160
I was not on one of the original authors of the Fish shell.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.440
That would be Axel.

25:02.440 --> 25:03.840
I wanted to attempt his last name,

25:03.840 --> 25:05.920
but you can put it in show notes.

25:05.920 --> 25:09.600
And Axel started the project in 2005 as the first release.

25:09.600 --> 25:12.600
And I think development started to slow down around 2010.

25:12.600 --> 25:14.720
And that's when I picked it up.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.920
And I was a user of the Fish shell,

25:16.920 --> 25:19.000
and I was very happy with it.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.360
But there were some bugs I found or things

25:21.360 --> 25:22.680
that I thought could work a little differently.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.640
And I just decided to scratch my own itch

25:24.640 --> 25:26.160
and set out to fix them.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.680
And I figured it would take me a week.

25:27.680 --> 25:33.360
And then a year later, I was pretty embedded in it

25:33.360 --> 25:34.000
at that point.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.760
So that's how I got my start, just scratching my own itch.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.480
Well, isn't that interesting.

25:38.480 --> 25:40.480
How many stories have we heard like that, where somebody

25:40.480 --> 25:41.960
starts scratching their own itch?

25:41.960 --> 25:45.200
You guys just recently had a big release, too.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.080
Was it version 3?

25:46.080 --> 25:47.400
Is that the new version that just came out?

25:47.400 --> 25:48.920
3.0, or is it 0.3?

25:48.920 --> 25:49.880
It is 3.0.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.680
So this is the third major release.

25:52.680 --> 25:56.000
The first major release where I was on the project

25:56.000 --> 25:59.200
was 2.0 and 3.0 signals that we've

25:59.200 --> 26:02.960
made some fairly radical changes in this release.

26:02.960 --> 26:05.080
And that's why we think it deserves a new major version

26:05.080 --> 26:05.600
number.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.560
Would you chat a little bit more about those?

26:07.560 --> 26:09.120
One thing I've always liked about Phish

26:09.120 --> 26:12.120
is I have it on some systems, not all, unfortunately.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.440
But whenever I use it, I'm not concerned, usually,

26:14.440 --> 26:15.740
that things are going to break.

26:15.740 --> 26:16.840
It's mostly just work.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.440
So are there some things people really

26:18.440 --> 26:20.560
need to look out for when they upgrade here?

26:20.560 --> 26:22.280
There's a few things that are different,

26:22.280 --> 26:26.080
but we don't want anyone to have an experience where they

26:26.080 --> 26:28.440
install it and their software breaks.

26:28.440 --> 26:32.400
So a lot of the changes are backwards compatible.

26:32.400 --> 26:36.720
So for example, we support now in 3.0 the double ampersand

26:36.720 --> 26:40.960
for AND or double pipe for OR, a very long requested feature.

26:40.960 --> 26:45.280
But the old syntax, the explicit AND and OR commands

26:45.280 --> 26:46.080
are still supported.

26:46.080 --> 26:47.440
So none of that breaks.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.240
Very good.

26:48.240 --> 26:48.840
Yeah.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.720
We also have a way of staging breaking changes

26:51.720 --> 26:55.000
called feature flags, which allow users to opt into it.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.720
So these are changes that we plan

26:56.720 --> 27:00.160
to make in the future when the current syntax is deprecated.

27:00.160 --> 27:03.520
So this includes, for example, question mark as a glob.

27:03.520 --> 27:06.400
This often breaks users who paste in the URL,

27:06.400 --> 27:09.040
and this will be interpreted as a wildcard.

27:09.040 --> 27:11.680
So with 3.0, we plan to eventually remove

27:11.680 --> 27:13.720
the question mark wildcard.

27:13.720 --> 27:16.200
But in 3.0, you can opt into that removal

27:16.200 --> 27:19.240
by just setting a feature flag in one of your variables.

27:19.240 --> 27:22.920
So there's a lot of forward-looking features

27:22.920 --> 27:24.880
in the 3.0 release like that.

27:24.880 --> 27:28.320
Is the feature flag new to 3.0, or has that

27:28.320 --> 27:29.520
been around for a while?

27:29.520 --> 27:33.480
The whole mechanism of staging these deprecations

27:33.480 --> 27:35.640
and breaking changes is part of 3.0.

27:35.640 --> 27:36.140
Wow.

27:36.140 --> 27:36.640
Interesting.

27:36.640 --> 27:39.680
It signals a bit of a philosophical shift

27:39.680 --> 27:43.280
where we're trying to be a little less dogmatic

27:43.280 --> 27:48.200
and a little more practical and move a little faster, right?

27:48.200 --> 27:50.680
It is very rare to have any program,

27:50.680 --> 27:52.920
but especially a shell, remove features.

27:52.920 --> 27:55.400
Normally, they just secrete features over time.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.800
So we want to have the capability

27:56.800 --> 28:00.440
to have the right feature set, not just the sum of all past

28:00.440 --> 28:01.040
feature sets.

28:01.040 --> 28:01.540
Right.

28:01.540 --> 28:03.480
But how you actually pull that off

28:03.480 --> 28:05.680
is a little new in the world of shells.

28:05.680 --> 28:07.560
And getting it right is important.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.480
That's right.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.760
It is a little risky, so we'll see how it works out.

28:10.760 --> 28:11.280
Yeah.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.480
Oh, I'm excited to hear that.

28:13.480 --> 28:16.240
Let's keep talking about the practical stuff for a moment.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.000
One of the things I love about Fish Shell, to be honest

28:18.000 --> 28:20.720
with you, is I can load it everywhere, Fedora, Arch,

28:20.720 --> 28:23.680
Ubuntu, and even Mac OS, and probably the subsystem

28:23.680 --> 28:25.760
for Linux if I was on a Windows box.

28:25.760 --> 28:28.520
And I really appreciate that fact.

28:28.520 --> 28:29.720
It's one of the, I mean, obviously,

28:29.720 --> 28:31.800
Bash is everywhere, but I don't want to use Bash, right?

28:31.800 --> 28:32.760
I want to use Fish.

28:32.760 --> 28:38.200
So I'm curious, roughly, is Linux your largest

28:38.200 --> 28:38.960
install base?

28:38.960 --> 28:41.320
Do you have, are there a bunch of Windows users?

28:41.320 --> 28:43.040
What's the user base look like for Fish?

28:43.040 --> 28:45.240
Yeah, honestly, I don't know that.

28:45.240 --> 28:51.680
I mean, Linux and Mac are both huge, the largest users,

28:51.680 --> 28:52.200
of course.

28:52.200 --> 28:54.160
But we don't track how many users there

28:54.160 --> 28:57.520
are from any particular platform.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.920
There's no telemetry in the Fish Shell, so we don't know.

28:59.920 --> 29:03.480
But we do have a lot of actually surprising use cases

29:03.480 --> 29:04.960
that we discover.

29:04.960 --> 29:12.760
The team that is on Haiku, which is the BOS recreation,

29:12.760 --> 29:15.360
they have a lot of Fish Shell fans there.

29:15.360 --> 29:19.120
And they have Fish Shell running on Haiku.

29:19.120 --> 29:20.120
That's awesome.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.600
Makes me really happy.

29:22.600 --> 29:25.320
WSL, a Windows subsystem for Linux,

29:25.320 --> 29:26.840
there's also a number of users there.

29:26.840 --> 29:30.320
I actually feel like WSL is a big opportunity for the Fish

29:30.320 --> 29:36.000
Shell because users who have WSL are less likely to be,

29:36.000 --> 29:38.800
you know, have a long history with Bash.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.760
So they're coming at it with fresh eyes.

29:40.760 --> 29:42.040
Yes.

29:42.040 --> 29:44.640
I run it on my Raspberry Pi.

29:44.640 --> 29:47.120
I run it on AWS.

29:47.120 --> 29:50.480
We even have a user running Fish on the TH2,

29:50.480 --> 29:55.360
which is a 33 petaflop supercomputer in Guangzhou,

29:55.360 --> 29:57.320
China.

29:57.320 --> 29:58.200
Right on.

29:58.200 --> 29:59.760
I bet Fish runs just great on there.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.000
I bet it does.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.080
I bet it does.

30:02.080 --> 30:03.600
Fish has always been one of those projects where

30:03.600 --> 30:06.760
you install it, and the defaults have just felt right.

30:06.760 --> 30:09.560
I've been able to install Fish and then run it for six months

30:09.560 --> 30:11.880
before I even changed a single thing.

30:11.880 --> 30:12.800
I really love it.

30:12.800 --> 30:16.800
And I think it's one of the projects

30:16.800 --> 30:19.000
that you can install on a new Linux user's computer

30:19.000 --> 30:21.640
and make the command line a little less intimidating.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.720
And that has massive potential.

30:23.720 --> 30:26.160
I agree completely.

30:26.160 --> 30:30.440
One of the design goals of Fish is that it be very user

30:30.440 --> 30:31.080
friendly.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.960
And the way we design features is we start by thinking about,

30:33.960 --> 30:37.320
what do we want the user to see, to encounter?

30:37.320 --> 30:39.280
And then we work backwards to the implementation

30:39.280 --> 30:40.680
of the feature from there.

30:40.680 --> 30:43.040
So for example, setting your prompt

30:43.040 --> 30:45.440
can be done either via the command line

30:45.440 --> 30:47.440
or via a graphical UI.

30:47.440 --> 30:50.640
There's a command Fish config, which spins up a little web

30:50.640 --> 30:54.000
server and opens a web page that connects to that, all local.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.640
And there's nothing on the network here.

30:55.640 --> 30:58.360
It allows you to set your colors and your prompt and so forth

30:58.360 --> 31:00.560
just with a graphical UI.

31:00.560 --> 31:03.000
So that's much more convenient for new users

31:03.000 --> 31:06.920
compared to, for example, setting the PS1 variable

31:06.920 --> 31:09.680
for controlling your prompt like you would do in Bash.

31:09.680 --> 31:11.200
Which is how I had been doing it.

31:11.200 --> 31:15.860
What's funny is I've been using Fish for years and years

31:15.860 --> 31:17.400
and years.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.080
And it was only until last week that I

31:19.080 --> 31:20.620
ran Fish config for the first time

31:20.620 --> 31:21.960
and did it through the web page.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.320
I've always just done it the old way, the old school way,

31:24.320 --> 31:26.320
because I'm used to the way Bash does it.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.920
That's how you assumed you would do it.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.620
But that web page was great because there

31:29.620 --> 31:33.440
was pre-suggested themes and looks and styles

31:33.440 --> 31:35.420
for my command line that I love.

31:35.420 --> 31:35.920
I love.

31:35.920 --> 31:38.600
And it's an example of making, again, the command line

31:38.600 --> 31:40.860
accessible to people that are maybe transitioning

31:40.860 --> 31:43.360
from another platform where you don't use the command line as

31:43.360 --> 31:43.800
much.

31:43.800 --> 31:44.660
And I think one of the things that

31:44.660 --> 31:46.400
makes Linux more usable as a platform

31:46.400 --> 31:48.200
is if we just acknowledge sometimes it's OK

31:48.200 --> 31:49.280
to use the command line.

31:49.280 --> 31:50.480
And people don't like that, but we

31:50.480 --> 31:51.980
can make the command line a better experience.

31:51.980 --> 31:52.480
Yeah, right.

31:52.480 --> 31:55.840
If we just embrace that and say, we have a great command line.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.680
Well, Peter, what else should people know about?

31:57.680 --> 31:58.920
Is there anything you want them to check out

31:58.920 --> 32:01.000
for the project or things you guys are working on

32:01.000 --> 32:03.360
or any destinations you want to send them?

32:03.360 --> 32:05.960
Well, the project is hosted on GitHub.

32:05.960 --> 32:09.340
We have five contributors on the project other than me

32:09.340 --> 32:11.800
who are very regular and very passionate.

32:11.800 --> 32:14.680
I'd like to give them some credit here

32:14.680 --> 32:18.680
because many of them are even more active than I am.

32:18.680 --> 32:21.280
In particular, I want to give credit

32:21.280 --> 32:24.700
to David Adam and Fabian, who are both very long time

32:24.700 --> 32:25.560
contributors.

32:25.560 --> 32:28.200
And we have Aaron Guise, who's done a ton of great work

32:28.200 --> 32:29.560
across all parts of the shell.

32:29.560 --> 32:32.360
And we have Saeed Shuar, who was with me from the beginning.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.800
And Mahmoud is our newest contributor,

32:34.800 --> 32:38.600
who's very active in porting fish and getting it running

32:38.600 --> 32:40.480
well on WSL.

32:40.480 --> 32:43.060
So I'm really grateful for all their contributions.

32:43.060 --> 32:47.040
It's actually pretty easy to get started contributing

32:47.040 --> 32:47.840
to the fish shell.

32:47.840 --> 32:53.160
A lot of contributors just have a command they want to run,

32:53.160 --> 32:55.760
and tab completions aren't working for it properly.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.840
So they can just add a tab completion.

32:57.840 --> 32:59.560
And that's a very easy way to get started

32:59.560 --> 33:00.920
or improving the documentation.

33:00.920 --> 33:05.360
So if you'd like to contribute, if you're a fish shell user,

33:05.360 --> 33:07.760
it's very easy to get started contributing to the shell.

33:07.760 --> 33:09.800
Yeah, I think especially in this case.

33:09.800 --> 33:13.120
That's more so than what is even, I think, common with

33:13.120 --> 33:14.460
an open source project like this.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.080
There's some stuff in there that is really

33:16.080 --> 33:17.960
user-facing, like documentation that anybody

33:17.960 --> 33:19.480
can participate in.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.720
Well, Peter, thanks so much for coming on the show.

33:21.720 --> 33:24.400
Thanks to you and the entire team

33:24.400 --> 33:26.960
for working on one of my absolute favorite pieces

33:26.960 --> 33:28.000
of open source software.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.080
All right, thanks, Chris.

33:29.080 --> 33:29.720
Thanks, Wes.

33:29.720 --> 33:32.440
And thank you to Peter for coming and chatting with us

33:32.440 --> 33:32.960
about that.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.240
Peter was great, real friendly.

33:34.240 --> 33:37.420
And it's an interesting tale, because as we

33:37.420 --> 33:42.040
talked about in that interview, at around 2012,

33:42.040 --> 33:45.120
Phish development had stagnated.

33:45.120 --> 33:48.880
It's very obvious if you go look at the commit analysis

33:48.880 --> 33:50.320
over on GitHub.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.760
And Peter stepped in and sort of reinvigorated the project.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.240
And they've just had a recent release.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.440
He wasn't the one who released it, right?

33:55.440 --> 33:57.640
There's enough other people in the project

33:57.640 --> 34:00.680
that there are several main contributing developers.

34:00.680 --> 34:02.200
So it seems healthy.

34:02.200 --> 34:05.400
It's probably not for some expert users.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.000
It might not even be a forever shell

34:07.000 --> 34:09.500
if you're going to go off and become like a terminal expert.

34:09.500 --> 34:12.000
But I think it's a shell that thinks

34:12.000 --> 34:15.040
about what the interaction between a user and a computer

34:15.040 --> 34:17.120
should be in a terminal environment.

34:17.120 --> 34:19.360
They're exploring interesting grounds.

34:19.360 --> 34:21.720
He almost made me switch to it.

34:21.720 --> 34:24.720
He almost convinced me, but almost.

34:24.720 --> 34:26.760
Well, you do need to be the curmudgeon, Joe.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.240
What would we do without you?

34:29.240 --> 34:31.720
OK, so let's move on to another area

34:31.720 --> 34:34.160
I've been excited about recently.

34:34.160 --> 34:38.920
That's gaming on Linux, and it's just some of my friends

34:38.920 --> 34:41.880
who are not Linux desktop enthusiasts.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.720
They might not even listen to the show.

34:43.720 --> 34:46.560
But they make a lot of comments about how great Proton is,

34:46.560 --> 34:50.360
how they can use their Linux desktops to game.

34:50.360 --> 34:51.720
And I've certainly experienced that.

34:51.720 --> 34:54.160
I've been advocating for it more.

34:54.160 --> 34:55.960
But while we were getting excited about that,

34:55.960 --> 34:58.200
we talked a lot about it here on Jupiter Broadcasting

34:58.200 --> 35:02.320
over our various holiday and year-end review episodes.

35:02.320 --> 35:05.360
There was a discussion right around the new year

35:05.360 --> 35:09.040
over on Twitter that I missed until now.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.360
It started with a tweet from Ben Golos, who

35:11.360 --> 35:13.240
works over at Uber Entertainment,

35:13.240 --> 35:15.920
actually local here over in Kirkland, Washington.

35:15.920 --> 35:17.960
They make Planetary Annihilation.

35:17.960 --> 35:20.200
And while the discussion is basically

35:20.200 --> 35:22.800
they shipped Planetary Annihilation on Windows, Mac,

35:22.800 --> 35:25.600
and Linux, Linux users were actually

35:25.600 --> 35:28.480
a big vocal part of the Kickstarter for the project.

35:28.480 --> 35:33.040
But in the end, they accounted for less than 0.1%

35:33.040 --> 35:36.200
of the sales and greater than 20%

35:36.200 --> 35:39.440
of auto-reported crashes and support tickets.

35:39.440 --> 35:43.040
Most of that graphics driver-related, I guess.

35:43.040 --> 35:46.880
His opinion would totally skip Linux.

35:46.880 --> 35:49.180
So does this mean, is this a fundamental problem?

35:49.180 --> 35:50.760
Is there something we're missing here?

35:50.760 --> 35:53.040
Or does it just mean that much like Electron apps,

35:53.040 --> 35:55.960
we're going to get games, we just won't get them natively?

35:55.960 --> 35:58.560
I think that that is the reality of the situation.

35:58.560 --> 36:03.280
Because if you look at this Twitter thread,

36:03.280 --> 36:05.920
it's easy to kind of come down on the side of, well,

36:05.920 --> 36:08.240
it's just not worth supporting Linux.

36:08.240 --> 36:10.760
But then people have chipped in on the Hacker News

36:10.760 --> 36:12.840
thread about this that surfaced this week,

36:12.840 --> 36:15.600
saying that, well, they did it wrong.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.320
They didn't go into it with their eyes fully open.

36:18.320 --> 36:21.600
They kind of thought it would be easy to port it to Linux.

36:21.600 --> 36:24.400
And the reality dawned on them that it was actually

36:24.400 --> 36:25.160
quite hard.

36:25.160 --> 36:26.600
And I think in that Twitter thread,

36:26.600 --> 36:30.600
there's a very, very depressing and telling phrase

36:30.600 --> 36:32.680
that he says, adding Linux support

36:32.680 --> 36:35.880
ended up likely costing Uber hundreds of thousands

36:35.880 --> 36:40.360
of dollars for a few hundred dollars in sales.

36:40.360 --> 36:44.120
And that just doesn't look good for anyone

36:44.120 --> 36:47.680
trying to port any software to Linux, never mind just games.

36:47.680 --> 36:48.800
Yeah, that is true.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.600
And that's part of the problem is,

36:50.600 --> 36:53.440
even if we have a more successful game development

36:53.440 --> 36:56.160
story in 2019, you might not know about it.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.680
You might not know the right choices.

36:57.680 --> 36:58.840
You might not.

36:58.840 --> 37:00.040
That's hard to find.

37:00.040 --> 37:03.000
There is no universal development kit to target.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.600
You can be an expert at game development

37:04.600 --> 37:08.680
and still not be able to develop for our platform

37:08.680 --> 37:09.840
and have it be a success.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.480
And that's concerning.

37:11.480 --> 37:15.160
When the whole Proton thing broke as a story,

37:15.160 --> 37:17.400
there was kind of two ways to look at it.

37:17.400 --> 37:18.880
One is that, OK, well, this means

37:18.880 --> 37:21.920
that no one will bother developing natively for Linux

37:21.920 --> 37:22.720
anymore.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.680
But the other way to look at it was, well,

37:24.680 --> 37:28.920
it will enable a lot of Linux users to use these games,

37:28.920 --> 37:32.200
play these games that they otherwise couldn't before.

37:32.200 --> 37:33.760
And it will potentially make people

37:33.760 --> 37:38.160
on the fence about switching to Linux make that switch.

37:38.160 --> 37:42.280
And then where the users are, the development goes.

37:42.280 --> 37:44.880
I think that realistically, it's probably the former rather

37:44.880 --> 37:46.280
than the latter, though, isn't it?

37:46.280 --> 37:51.320
That you're much more likely to get just Windows games working

37:51.320 --> 37:54.440
and tested with Proton, and that's good enough.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.800
Why bother doing a whole native port

37:56.800 --> 37:59.960
when you can just use this off-the-shelf solution

37:59.960 --> 38:00.760
from Valve?

38:00.760 --> 38:02.040
Yep, that is true.

38:02.040 --> 38:04.600
And then even more so, we're still,

38:04.600 --> 38:08.460
even with it working really well just out of Valve,

38:08.460 --> 38:10.160
you're still going to buy a computer that

38:10.160 --> 38:11.360
probably has Windows on it.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.800
And if you're a gamer but not a Linux fan,

38:13.800 --> 38:16.300
there's not going to be a big reason that you should ever

38:16.300 --> 38:17.000
switch to Linux.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.840
Now, you might have a better switching story

38:18.840 --> 38:21.960
if you eventually happen to listen to this program, say.

38:21.960 --> 38:27.000
But we're just still same old, same old, I guess.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.200
I don't know, though, Wes.

38:28.200 --> 38:30.560
My Evo 970 didn't come with Windows on it.

38:30.560 --> 38:33.400
It came completely blank, and I had to install whatever

38:33.400 --> 38:34.240
I wanted onto it.

38:34.240 --> 38:37.880
And that's the reality for most gamers who build their PC.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.600
I mean, most enthusiasts who want to go full RGB and all

38:40.600 --> 38:42.920
of that, they build their machines.

38:42.920 --> 38:46.080
So this argument of that they come with Windows,

38:46.080 --> 38:48.400
I don't think is necessarily true.

38:48.400 --> 38:49.960
Obviously, laptops come with Windows.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.240
But if you're doing a self-build,

38:52.240 --> 38:56.760
and no self-respecting gamer would use a pre-built desktop,

38:56.760 --> 38:57.760
surely.

38:57.760 --> 38:58.600
Yeah, sure, sure.

38:58.600 --> 38:59.180
Yeah, of course.

38:59.180 --> 39:01.760
But they just consider Windows to be part of that build.

39:01.760 --> 39:03.400
No, that's a very interesting point.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.920
Like, there's this cultural element.

39:05.920 --> 39:08.160
So if we can maybe change some of that,

39:08.160 --> 39:09.980
then if you're already an enthusiast,

39:09.980 --> 39:11.560
you're willing to do research, you're

39:11.560 --> 39:15.840
willing to maybe tweak or tune, Linux does

39:15.840 --> 39:17.280
have a better story there now.

39:17.280 --> 39:21.400
Yeah, but you only have to look at big gaming and PC YouTube

39:21.400 --> 39:23.200
channels, like Linus Tech Tips.

39:23.200 --> 39:26.120
And he had this video, Linux gaming

39:26.120 --> 39:28.160
doesn't suck, because the assumption was

39:28.160 --> 39:29.280
that it would just suck.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.120
And then he actually tried some Linux games

39:31.120 --> 39:33.280
and said, actually, they're all right.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.320
And that was a surprise.

39:34.320 --> 39:35.740
And that's that culture, isn't it,

39:35.740 --> 39:39.480
that gaming really is all about Windows.

39:39.480 --> 39:42.480
That's just been the assumption for 20-plus years,

39:42.480 --> 39:44.240
that if you want to play games on a PC,

39:44.240 --> 39:46.360
you're using Windows to do that.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.000
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.400
And unfortunately, there are still many workflows

39:51.400 --> 39:56.640
that you might need a Windows or another proprietary operating

39:56.640 --> 39:59.080
system to get your work done.

39:59.080 --> 40:02.520
And one of those, for a long time and still remains one,

40:02.520 --> 40:05.680
is the Adobe platform, their whole creative suite

40:05.680 --> 40:07.440
of applications.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.880
I know, I mean, I've used them over the years.

40:09.880 --> 40:10.920
I don't have them now.

40:10.920 --> 40:12.720
But they're obviously the standard.

40:12.720 --> 40:14.480
And Linux users, for a long time,

40:14.480 --> 40:18.800
have been wondering, do we have even a shot of ever getting

40:18.800 --> 40:20.120
these applications?

40:20.120 --> 40:22.480
You've done some hard work and found out a little bit more

40:22.480 --> 40:23.760
information, though, Joe.

40:23.760 --> 40:27.400
Yeah, I've been chatting with Jason Evangelo, who

40:27.400 --> 40:29.920
has become well-known in the last few months,

40:29.920 --> 40:33.320
I suppose the back half of last year, for writing for Forbes.

40:33.320 --> 40:36.400
He kind of switched from writing about gaming and hardware

40:36.400 --> 40:38.940
to writing about Linux as he got into Linux.

40:38.940 --> 40:41.560
And it's just become really, really popular.

40:41.560 --> 40:44.800
Everyone seems to be following on Twitter

40:44.800 --> 40:45.920
and reading his articles.

40:45.920 --> 40:48.040
And more importantly, it seems that he

40:48.040 --> 40:50.880
has driven a lot of people into our community, people

40:50.880 --> 40:54.320
who are into gaming or kind of on the fence or whatever.

40:54.320 --> 40:58.840
He is really doing good stuff for the whole Linux community,

40:58.840 --> 41:00.280
as far as I can see.

41:00.280 --> 41:02.000
And he's very pragmatic.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.840
I know, OK, some people are going to say,

41:03.840 --> 41:06.120
oh, we don't want that proprietary software.

41:06.120 --> 41:10.440
Why don't you just use Kdenlive or whatever or GIMP or Krita?

41:10.440 --> 41:13.240
But the reality is that if we are

41:13.240 --> 41:16.040
going to grow the Linux user base,

41:16.040 --> 41:18.480
we're going to need some of these huge proprietary

41:18.480 --> 41:22.240
commercial bits of software, like Creative Cloud.

41:22.240 --> 41:24.400
And he is very much of that belief.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.040
He's very much a pragmatist.

41:26.040 --> 41:26.840
We need both, right?

41:26.840 --> 41:28.640
We should have good open source technology,

41:28.640 --> 41:31.840
but we also need to use what the market's using.

41:31.840 --> 41:33.320
Well, in an ideal world, we wouldn't

41:33.320 --> 41:35.320
need any proprietary software at all.

41:35.320 --> 41:39.920
But it's a vicious circle of the proprietary software

41:39.920 --> 41:42.400
isn't there so the users don't come to the platform,

41:42.400 --> 41:45.320
and then the developers don't develop open source software

41:45.320 --> 41:47.160
for them to use.

41:47.160 --> 41:50.680
So I think it's hard for me to say

41:50.680 --> 41:53.760
that I want this proprietary software to come to Linux,

41:53.760 --> 41:56.760
because I don't think I would use very much of it if it did.

41:56.760 --> 41:59.160
But I think that an awful lot of people would,

41:59.160 --> 42:01.520
and that would be better overall for Linux,

42:01.520 --> 42:02.960
because this is all additional stuff.

42:02.960 --> 42:04.680
It's like the Proton stuff.

42:04.680 --> 42:05.360
It's like Steam.

42:05.360 --> 42:07.960
It's like the graphics drivers.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.600
You don't have to use any of that stuff.

42:09.600 --> 42:11.920
You can run Debian or Triskel or whatever

42:11.920 --> 42:14.080
and just run completely free software.

42:14.080 --> 42:15.080
That's a good point.

42:15.080 --> 42:18.760
It's all additions to Linux and free software.

42:18.760 --> 42:20.360
So I see it as a good thing.

42:20.360 --> 42:22.800
But yeah, he had a chance to talk

42:22.800 --> 42:27.080
to some people from Adobe, some quite important people

42:27.080 --> 42:27.960
actually.

42:27.960 --> 42:30.840
And so I thought that I would catch up with him

42:30.840 --> 42:32.600
and get him on the show and speak

42:32.600 --> 42:34.120
to him about how that went.

42:34.120 --> 42:36.160
And so should we have a listen to that?

42:36.160 --> 42:37.000
Let's do it.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.800
Thanks a lot for coming on the show, Jason.

42:38.800 --> 42:39.960
Yeah, you bet.

42:39.960 --> 42:40.840
Happy to be here.

42:40.840 --> 42:42.120
Yeah, we've been wanting to get you on Linux

42:42.120 --> 42:43.200
unplugged for a long time.

42:43.200 --> 42:45.560
And finally, the timings have worked out.

42:45.560 --> 42:48.460
Yeah, and before, when you asked me the first time around,

42:48.460 --> 42:49.160
I was really shy.

42:49.160 --> 42:52.000
And now I'm not.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.920
So just a little bit of background.

42:53.920 --> 42:56.760
You've been writing for Forbes for quite a while now.

42:56.760 --> 42:59.520
And in the relatively recent past,

42:59.520 --> 43:00.920
you started writing about Linux.

43:00.920 --> 43:03.200
And those articles have really taken off.

43:03.200 --> 43:05.760
And you've used your Twitter following as well

43:05.760 --> 43:07.800
to kind of help that.

43:07.800 --> 43:09.560
And it's just gone a bit crazy, hasn't it?

43:09.560 --> 43:12.480
It has, in a very unexpected way.

43:12.480 --> 43:17.720
When you spend like six years on a major platform talking

43:17.720 --> 43:24.560
about AMD and NVIDIA and Intel and reviewing big products

43:24.560 --> 43:27.560
and things like that or just breaking news,

43:27.560 --> 43:31.400
and then six years later, you kind of

43:31.400 --> 43:36.420
stumble into Linux for the first time in like 13 years

43:36.420 --> 43:38.000
and fall in love with it.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.720
And at that point, I gradually decided, you know,

43:42.720 --> 43:43.800
I'm loving this.

43:43.800 --> 43:48.040
I'm loving the discovery and really loving

43:48.040 --> 43:52.600
just writing about it and being so engaged on Twitter

43:52.600 --> 43:56.000
and Facebook with people who are enjoying the content.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.160
It's been a repeatable thing where I will take,

43:59.160 --> 44:00.920
say I'm writing two articles in one day.

44:00.920 --> 44:05.500
And I'll say, OK, hey, Introware is launching their Aries

44:05.500 --> 44:09.720
all in one desktop PC with Ubuntu and Ubuntu Mate, right?

44:09.720 --> 44:13.160
And then the same day, I'll write something about NVIDIA.

44:13.160 --> 44:16.360
And the Introware article will get more traffic.

44:16.360 --> 44:18.080
And it blows me away every single time.

44:18.080 --> 44:20.720
But it is becoming a consistent thing.

44:20.720 --> 44:24.820
And I think that there's a really, at least to me,

44:24.820 --> 44:27.040
a surprisingly large audience who

44:27.040 --> 44:30.000
is hungry for that content in kind

44:30.000 --> 44:35.800
of a, I guess, non-technical, more conversational manner,

44:35.800 --> 44:36.840
if that makes sense.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.600
Yeah, well, it seems to be working for you.

44:38.600 --> 44:42.000
I've seen you post stats about the Linux articles being

44:42.000 --> 44:44.320
the most popular of all time, almost.

44:44.320 --> 44:49.400
Yeah, towards the end of the year, I wrote about Deepin.

44:49.400 --> 44:51.840
And it was just kind of an opinion piece,

44:51.840 --> 44:54.280
talking about why I think that it's

44:54.280 --> 44:57.560
a more beautiful desktop experience than Windows

44:57.560 --> 44:59.160
and Mac OS.

44:59.160 --> 45:03.600
And within a few weeks, that climbed to the number three

45:03.600 --> 45:08.320
most viewed article since 2012.

45:08.320 --> 45:11.320
We're talking about beating stuff like Pokemon Go

45:11.320 --> 45:13.080
when it launched and things like that.

45:13.080 --> 45:17.000
I mean, yeah, incredible, just incredible.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.040
Months later, I'm just still blown away.

45:19.040 --> 45:20.880
And it's been a blast.

45:20.880 --> 45:23.960
But just before Christmas, there was a bit of a blow up

45:23.960 --> 45:28.760
on Twitter about Adobe and Premiere.

45:28.760 --> 45:31.080
And people requesting that for Linux.

45:31.080 --> 45:33.520
And you managed to send so much traffic their way

45:33.520 --> 45:36.600
that they shut down the topic.

45:36.600 --> 45:37.720
So what was all that about?

45:37.720 --> 45:39.440
They did.

45:39.440 --> 45:41.720
I think that I actually heard about it

45:41.720 --> 45:43.960
through a couple of my Twitter followers

45:43.960 --> 45:46.760
and also Michael at Foronix.

45:46.760 --> 45:49.640
And I want to make sure people understand he's

45:49.640 --> 45:51.480
the one who wrote it first, right?

45:51.480 --> 45:55.560
I just kind of elevated it and gave it a bit more exposure.

45:55.560 --> 45:58.200
But I do want to make sure that people realize

45:58.200 --> 46:00.840
he kind of broke that news.

46:00.840 --> 46:03.800
But anyway, I wrote an article saying, hey,

46:03.800 --> 46:07.380
Adobe wants your feedback on bringing Premiere Pro to Linux.

46:07.380 --> 46:10.360
And the tweet blew up.

46:10.360 --> 46:12.440
The article blew up.

46:12.440 --> 46:15.260
And I think within three or four days,

46:15.260 --> 46:21.000
they had somewhere north of 6,000 upvotes for that.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.520
And a lot of really healthy discussion

46:23.520 --> 46:26.360
in there between both the Linux community and a lot

46:26.360 --> 46:32.320
of the Adobe staff, like I think it was Patrick Palmer, who

46:32.320 --> 46:34.480
does, he's their senior product manager

46:34.480 --> 46:37.840
for professional video editing for Creative Cloud.

46:37.840 --> 46:42.040
And at some point, someone alerted me to the fact

46:42.040 --> 46:43.240
that it was just gone.

46:43.240 --> 46:45.080
They're like, I'm trying to click the link in your article.

46:45.080 --> 46:45.880
It's just not there.

46:45.880 --> 46:46.440
It's nowhere.

46:46.440 --> 46:47.800
It's gone.

46:47.800 --> 46:53.840
And Adobe Help, actually, got in touch with me.

46:53.840 --> 46:58.360
And they said that it had received so much,

46:58.360 --> 47:01.320
like a surge in upvotes, that it had triggered their spam

47:01.320 --> 47:03.240
filters, and they had taken it down.

47:03.240 --> 47:06.640
They just had no idea that it would be so popular.

47:06.640 --> 47:09.320
So that got resolved.

47:09.320 --> 47:11.280
And yeah, that got resolved soon.

47:11.280 --> 47:12.280
And that was good.

47:12.280 --> 47:13.480
And then people kept on voting.

47:13.480 --> 47:17.240
So after that, sometime after that,

47:17.240 --> 47:22.480
Adobe's Help account on Twitter actually reached out to me.

47:22.480 --> 47:25.000
And they were like, hey, Bill Roberts and Patrick Palmer

47:25.000 --> 47:31.160
would love to just chat with you about your point of view

47:31.160 --> 47:34.040
as someone in the Linux community

47:34.040 --> 47:38.000
looking at the possibility of Adobe products being

47:38.000 --> 47:38.840
ported over to Linux.

47:38.840 --> 47:41.360
And I said, great, let's do it.

47:41.360 --> 47:44.200
And so yeah, we got on the phone like four or five days later,

47:44.200 --> 47:45.600
and we had a really great chat.

47:45.600 --> 47:47.400
But before you had this chat with them,

47:47.400 --> 47:51.400
they did officially respond and say something along the lines

47:51.400 --> 47:54.960
of, we take this interest very seriously,

47:54.960 --> 47:56.640
but don't get your hopes up.

47:56.640 --> 47:58.480
There's a lot of fragmentation with Linux,

47:58.480 --> 48:01.480
and it's not just supporting one platform.

48:01.480 --> 48:03.200
It means supporting loads of different ones

48:03.200 --> 48:06.320
and basically saying, thanks for the interest,

48:06.320 --> 48:07.920
but don't hold your breath.

48:07.920 --> 48:11.200
Yeah, and I think that that discouraged a lot of people.

48:11.200 --> 48:14.920
But in a way, Joe, I kind of appreciate them

48:14.920 --> 48:19.840
for not getting people's hopes up.

48:19.840 --> 48:23.280
Although through the course of the chat we had,

48:23.280 --> 48:26.920
it became apparent to me that what matters right now

48:26.920 --> 48:29.400
is that this is a possibility.

48:29.400 --> 48:30.700
And this is what they told them.

48:30.700 --> 48:32.160
This is what Bill and Patrick said.

48:32.160 --> 48:33.960
They're like, this is a possibility now.

48:33.960 --> 48:36.000
They weren't entertaining this idea before.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.160
Oh, wow, so it really has made a difference then.

48:38.160 --> 48:39.520
It really has.

48:39.520 --> 48:42.860
And I don't know if it was, let's be honest,

48:42.860 --> 48:47.440
it probably wasn't the user voice post and feedback

48:47.440 --> 48:50.160
that prompted that, but it may have helped, right?

48:50.160 --> 48:53.640
It may have definitely changed or influenced maybe

48:53.640 --> 48:58.400
their timeline or brought a few other important members

48:58.400 --> 49:00.120
of the team over to the Linux side of the fence.

49:00.120 --> 49:02.320
I don't know, but what matters is

49:02.320 --> 49:07.320
that they are looking at this as something that's possible now.

49:07.320 --> 49:10.160
And when they said that there was this fragmentation problem,

49:10.160 --> 49:12.720
everyone replied to them saying, snaps, flat packs,

49:12.720 --> 49:14.200
snaps, flat packs.

49:14.200 --> 49:17.040
Is that something that they weren't aware of or what?

49:17.040 --> 49:19.040
They're very aware of it.

49:19.040 --> 49:21.840
And I kind of brought that up.

49:21.840 --> 49:24.320
I said, hey, you can use stuff like Vulkan.

49:24.320 --> 49:27.600
You can focus maybe on just one distro

49:27.600 --> 49:29.680
and don't spread yourself too thin.

49:29.680 --> 49:31.520
But they're completely aware of all

49:31.520 --> 49:34.800
of the technical environments surrounding

49:34.800 --> 49:39.120
what it would take to port Premiere Pro over to Linux.

49:39.120 --> 49:42.920
But Patrick's problem is that there's

49:42.920 --> 49:46.040
a major difference between developing and testing, right?

49:46.040 --> 49:49.520
Because sure, they could develop it for Ubuntu.

49:49.520 --> 49:53.080
But it will get used on other distributions, right?

49:53.080 --> 49:54.640
And there's all these combinations

49:54.640 --> 49:59.280
of distro and CPU and GPU and everything else.

49:59.280 --> 50:03.960
And the cost of testing those and scaling that up

50:03.960 --> 50:05.960
is what concerns them.

50:05.960 --> 50:08.880
But beyond that, they want the product

50:08.880 --> 50:12.560
on everything it could possibly be used on, right?

50:12.560 --> 50:16.200
And they want to come out of the gate flawlessly.

50:16.200 --> 50:18.560
Even though they're very aware, and they told me this,

50:18.560 --> 50:21.960
they're very aware that they could have hazardly released

50:21.960 --> 50:24.740
something on one distribution, and maybe everything

50:24.740 --> 50:25.240
doesn't work.

50:25.240 --> 50:27.820
And they know the community will make it work, right?

50:27.820 --> 50:29.400
But that's not how they want to do it.

50:29.400 --> 50:31.680
They want to come out of the gate flawlessly.

50:31.680 --> 50:36.200
And one other aspect of this is that the conversation isn't

50:36.200 --> 50:38.200
just about developing Premiere Pro.

50:38.200 --> 50:41.160
And I think that a lot of people in the Linux community

50:41.160 --> 50:44.000
think, why not just do that, right?

50:44.000 --> 50:45.520
That can't take a lot of resources.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.360
It can't take a lot of time.

50:47.360 --> 50:49.880
But Adobe's issue is that their users

50:49.880 --> 50:52.480
are tapping into their entire ecosystem, right?

50:52.480 --> 50:56.640
They have a workflow that normally extends

50:56.640 --> 50:58.580
beyond just a single Adobe app.

50:58.580 --> 51:01.200
Well, yeah, people want the whole Creative Cloud, don't they?

51:01.200 --> 51:01.700
Exactly.

51:01.700 --> 51:05.120
And so that is bringing the entire Creative Cloud

51:05.120 --> 51:09.640
is what seemed to me to be a monumental effort.

51:09.640 --> 51:12.880
And they just don't want their products

51:12.880 --> 51:17.160
coming onto Linux handicapped and kind of robbing users

51:17.160 --> 51:21.320
of what they've come to expect from their products, right?

51:21.320 --> 51:24.640
And another wrinkle to this is that, obviously, they

51:24.640 --> 51:27.240
want to achieve some levels of parity

51:27.240 --> 51:29.400
when we're talking about performance, right?

51:29.400 --> 51:33.360
They want to have parity between Mac OS and Windows

51:33.360 --> 51:34.440
and Linux.

51:34.440 --> 51:36.040
But that's only half the story.

51:36.040 --> 51:39.280
If all the third-party libraries don't support the format,

51:39.280 --> 51:41.960
having that great performance is kind of useless.

51:41.960 --> 51:45.280
So it really is that entire ecosystem

51:45.280 --> 51:48.600
that has to start coming together.

51:48.600 --> 51:52.280
Yeah, suddenly this becomes quite a large endeavor,

51:52.280 --> 51:54.480
sort of almost too much to take on.

51:54.480 --> 51:55.920
Yeah, but yes.

51:55.920 --> 51:56.920
I mean, yes.

51:56.920 --> 52:00.600
And they did have a lot of interesting things

52:00.600 --> 52:03.080
to say about enterprise.

52:03.080 --> 52:06.800
I mean, not in a lot of detail, but that's

52:06.800 --> 52:07.960
where they would focus first.

52:07.960 --> 52:09.240
I will tell you that.

52:09.240 --> 52:12.520
That's where Adobe would focus first is the enterprise.

52:12.520 --> 52:14.640
But here's what's really interesting.

52:14.640 --> 52:18.600
The path to having these Adobe products on Linux,

52:18.600 --> 52:20.800
where do you think that would happen?

52:20.800 --> 52:22.400
Would it be just a straight port,

52:22.400 --> 52:26.040
or is there something actually coming that would kind of get

52:26.040 --> 52:27.120
their foot in the door?

52:27.120 --> 52:28.240
What do you mean by something coming?

52:28.240 --> 52:31.080
I mean, I would assume that the path to getting it on Linux

52:31.080 --> 52:34.640
would be snaps, essentially, or possibly Flatpak.

52:34.640 --> 52:38.600
Yeah, and I don't have an argument for or against that.

52:38.600 --> 52:42.360
But I think when we're talking about the architecture

52:42.360 --> 52:44.160
and the development and just the knowledge

52:44.160 --> 52:47.320
that their engineers and developers need,

52:47.320 --> 52:48.760
it's actually Premiere Rush.

52:48.760 --> 52:49.400
All right.

52:49.400 --> 52:52.280
So Premiere Rush, as probably you guys know,

52:52.280 --> 52:57.280
is kind of a mobile lite version of Premiere Pro.

52:57.280 --> 52:58.840
And it's already on desktop.

52:58.840 --> 53:00.800
It's already on iOS.

53:00.800 --> 53:04.560
But it was strongly hinted to me that once it

53:04.560 --> 53:08.840
comes to Android this year, that is their kind of first step.

53:08.840 --> 53:10.040
Oh, right.

53:10.040 --> 53:10.800
Interesting.

53:10.800 --> 53:12.160
And I wish I could tell you more,

53:12.160 --> 53:13.560
but that's really all that I know.

53:13.560 --> 53:18.320
I can just tell you that the way that they were explaining it

53:18.320 --> 53:21.200
to me and the kind of the attitude

53:21.200 --> 53:23.800
that they were portraying and the enthusiasm,

53:23.800 --> 53:25.880
don't take this as the gospel truth or anything.

53:25.880 --> 53:30.520
But I really feel like once this hits Android,

53:30.520 --> 53:33.360
it's something that they can legitimately start to explore.

53:33.360 --> 53:37.600
Did the market share issue come up at all?

53:37.600 --> 53:38.800
That must be in their mind.

53:42.320 --> 53:44.800
It really didn't.

53:44.800 --> 53:47.880
And I don't know if that's just because they

53:47.880 --> 53:49.880
were trying to be polite.

53:49.880 --> 53:52.080
And I also didn't bring it up.

53:52.080 --> 53:54.640
I was really encouraged walking away from that conversation

53:54.640 --> 53:58.480
because they don't view bringing their products to Linux,

53:58.480 --> 54:00.240
they don't see it as a technical barrier.

54:00.240 --> 54:02.600
They know how to get there.

54:02.600 --> 54:05.360
And I think the larger issue for them

54:05.360 --> 54:10.400
is having some reassurance that all of the effort

54:10.400 --> 54:13.800
that they invest into it, into not just Premier Pro,

54:13.800 --> 54:15.880
but the entire Creative Cloud suite,

54:15.880 --> 54:20.480
into the testing and scaling for every distribution

54:20.480 --> 54:25.960
and making sure that the entire ecosystem is working as it

54:25.960 --> 54:28.960
should on other major operating systems,

54:28.960 --> 54:32.680
it's encouraging to me that they know all that

54:32.680 --> 54:35.480
and that they are, in the process of developing

54:35.480 --> 54:39.520
Premier Rush for Android, kind of hinting at the fact

54:39.520 --> 54:43.320
that it helps them with potential Linux development.

54:43.320 --> 54:45.080
I was really happy walking away from that

54:45.080 --> 54:48.480
because it wasn't a lot of the Linux community, at least

54:48.480 --> 54:51.960
who's that has interacted with me about this whole Adobe

54:51.960 --> 54:56.920
thing, they feel like Adobe is just giving them lip service.

54:56.920 --> 54:58.440
Like, we're going to get your hopes up

54:58.440 --> 55:01.040
and we'll do this poll and we'll make you think it's possible

55:01.040 --> 55:03.160
and then we're just going to slam the door shut in your face.

55:03.160 --> 55:04.960
And that may have been true in the past,

55:04.960 --> 55:07.680
but I genuinely don't believe that's true now.

55:07.680 --> 55:11.400
And I think it's something they're at least open to

55:11.400 --> 55:16.200
and it's just a matter of resources and time.

55:16.200 --> 55:18.680
And market share probably, let's be honest.

55:18.680 --> 55:19.920
Yeah, yeah.

55:19.920 --> 55:22.700
Well, it'll be very interesting to see what happens with it,

55:22.700 --> 55:24.960
whether or not it is just lip service,

55:24.960 --> 55:27.080
but hopefully you'll be clued into what's happening

55:27.080 --> 55:29.080
and you can maybe come back and let us know.

55:29.080 --> 55:30.480
But it's been great to have you on

55:30.480 --> 55:33.400
and very much look forward to speaking to you again sometime.

55:33.400 --> 55:34.280
Yeah, absolutely.

55:34.280 --> 55:35.120
Thanks, Joe.

55:35.120 --> 55:37.600
Yes, thank you, Mr. Joe.

55:37.600 --> 55:39.760
That was a great contribution and a great interview

55:39.760 --> 55:40.520
with Jason.

55:40.520 --> 55:44.920
You know, he's been doing a lot of great writing these days

55:44.920 --> 55:47.320
and he's definitely a friend of the network.

55:47.320 --> 55:49.680
Yeah, could you tell that I'd only just woken up

55:49.680 --> 55:51.040
and it was still daylight?

55:51.040 --> 55:53.120
You know, I wasn't going to bring that up and no,

55:53.120 --> 55:55.200
actually, I don't think I could tell, so good job.

55:55.200 --> 56:00.200
It was a good chat and yeah, he's a very interesting guy.

56:00.800 --> 56:03.480
And yeah, I definitely recommend checking out his articles

56:03.480 --> 56:04.320
on Forbes.

56:04.320 --> 56:06.200
He's always got a positive spin on everything.

56:06.200 --> 56:08.040
That is actually what I was,

56:08.040 --> 56:09.000
I have a question for you about it,

56:09.000 --> 56:11.400
but that was going to be my takeaway from that interview

56:11.400 --> 56:14.200
is all right, well, there's nothing concrete there.

56:15.520 --> 56:16.520
Nothing's changed really,

56:16.520 --> 56:19.920
but it's also not a bad thing, you know?

56:19.920 --> 56:22.280
I mean, obviously Adobe runs a massive cloud platform.

56:22.280 --> 56:24.160
They clearly deploy a lot of Linux servers

56:24.160 --> 56:27.840
and have a wide array of technical experts at their employees.

56:27.840 --> 56:29.360
So of course they know about Linux,

56:29.360 --> 56:32.640
but it's nice to hear that there's not this like horrible bias

56:32.640 --> 56:35.400
or rejection or just, you know,

56:35.400 --> 56:37.880
like developers being tired of hearing this like

56:37.880 --> 56:41.080
very vocal minority of people clamor for support.

56:41.080 --> 56:43.520
So it seems like there's a positive relationship

56:43.520 --> 56:44.560
we can actually build on here

56:44.560 --> 56:45.920
and it might not be anything soon,

56:45.920 --> 56:49.040
but there are professionals who use Linux.

56:49.040 --> 56:53.560
Yeah, it does feel like it's going to be medium term

56:53.560 --> 56:54.520
rather than short term,

56:54.520 --> 56:57.120
but they are clued into the fact

56:57.120 --> 57:00.360
that Linux users do want to use their software,

57:00.360 --> 57:02.040
do want to pay them money.

57:02.040 --> 57:05.960
And as Windows and Mac OS seems to get worse and worse,

57:05.960 --> 57:08.040
and Linux seems to get better and better,

57:08.040 --> 57:08.960
then you never know,

57:08.960 --> 57:12.200
maybe we'll get that critical mass of users

57:12.200 --> 57:13.880
and maybe they will pull the trigger on it.

57:13.880 --> 57:14.720
Right, and I mean,

57:14.720 --> 57:17.440
they already have to adapt to a changing marketplace.

57:17.440 --> 57:19.360
Well, you know, Windows and Mac might still dominate

57:19.360 --> 57:22.120
the creative design markets.

57:22.120 --> 57:23.560
And mobile is huge, right?

57:23.560 --> 57:25.840
It's eating the desktop market share all the time.

57:25.840 --> 57:29.240
So they've already worked on some stuff for that platform.

57:29.240 --> 57:33.080
So I've talked to a couple of people inside Adobe as well.

57:33.080 --> 57:37.160
And they're actually, that platform is surprisingly modular.

57:37.160 --> 57:40.080
They have a lot of high level code and infrastructure

57:40.080 --> 57:41.320
to sort of orchestrate on top.

57:41.320 --> 57:44.080
So it was interesting to hear Jason talk about

57:44.080 --> 57:47.320
that the technicals aren't the problem

57:47.320 --> 57:50.960
and that it comes down to something like, you know,

57:50.960 --> 57:52.320
not wanting to cripple the product,

57:52.320 --> 57:55.000
wanting to have a good reputation.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.240
That's a very business sort of concern

57:57.240 --> 57:59.640
that I think sometimes we in the open source world

57:59.640 --> 58:00.480
forget about.

58:00.480 --> 58:01.960
Yeah, it is all about dollars and cents

58:01.960 --> 58:02.880
at the end of the day, isn't it?

58:02.880 --> 58:04.720
Right, I mean, I guess it has to be

58:04.720 --> 58:07.040
because that's what keeps the whole thing going.

58:07.040 --> 58:08.360
And clearly there's a lot of people

58:08.360 --> 58:10.480
who use and rely on their products.

58:10.480 --> 58:12.400
So I can't blame them.

58:12.400 --> 58:14.640
Time will tell.

58:14.640 --> 58:16.840
Maybe go try some free and open source software

58:16.840 --> 58:19.000
and submit bug reports

58:19.000 --> 58:20.880
and see if you can make them a little bit better.

58:20.880 --> 58:21.720
Yep.

58:21.720 --> 58:23.400
All right, do you want to hear about my toy then?

58:23.400 --> 58:24.400
Yes, I do.

58:24.400 --> 58:27.400
We teased it a little bit at the top of the show.

58:27.400 --> 58:30.920
You were very gracious despite being woken up early

58:30.920 --> 58:33.360
by this delivery of something you've been expecting

58:33.360 --> 58:35.840
for quite some time, I believe.

58:35.840 --> 58:36.680
What did you get?

58:36.680 --> 58:38.520
Yeah, I've been wanting this for quite some time

58:38.520 --> 58:40.480
and finally sorted it out.

58:40.480 --> 58:43.040
This is an Entraware Apollo laptop.

58:43.040 --> 58:46.720
Now I have to say quickly, full disclosure,

58:46.720 --> 58:49.000
Entraware do sponsor my other show,

58:49.000 --> 58:50.600
my independent show, Late Night Linux,

58:50.600 --> 58:52.800
but this will be completely unbiased.

58:52.800 --> 58:53.920
I can't do a full review

58:53.920 --> 58:56.280
because I've only had it for a matter of hours

58:56.280 --> 58:58.440
and I did go back to sleep briefly today as well.

58:58.440 --> 58:59.840
So.

58:59.840 --> 59:01.120
You deserve to, you deserve to.

59:01.120 --> 59:02.880
Yeah, I haven't had much time with it.

59:02.880 --> 59:05.000
So it's really just first impressions.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.400
But I'm pretty pleased with it so far.

59:07.400 --> 59:08.840
Turning it on straight away,

59:08.840 --> 59:12.040
the screen was just super bright, super sharp.

59:12.040 --> 59:13.840
And yeah, really, really impressed.

59:13.840 --> 59:16.440
This is their 14 inch Ultrabook

59:16.440 --> 59:18.320
that I'm talking about here called Apollo.

59:18.320 --> 59:21.600
Right, okay, so Chris had an Apollo as well

59:21.600 --> 59:24.040
and I've used that somewhat extensively,

59:24.040 --> 59:28.760
but is this right, that was a 13 inch screen size,

59:28.760 --> 59:30.760
but the form factor hasn't actually changed?

59:30.760 --> 59:33.240
Yeah, it's the same chassis, but smaller bezels.

59:33.240 --> 59:34.480
Oh, I like it.

59:34.480 --> 59:37.120
Yeah, so they've squeezed that 14 inch screen into it

59:37.120 --> 59:40.280
and that gives you that extra little bit of real estate.

59:40.280 --> 59:43.960
It's 1080p, we're not talking about crazy 4K or anything.

59:43.960 --> 59:45.680
And on a 14 inch screen,

59:45.680 --> 59:48.960
do you really need any more than 1080p? I certainly don't.

59:48.960 --> 59:51.760
No, no, I mean, I think you probably need a bigger screen

59:51.760 --> 59:53.600
if you're gonna really leverage those resolutions,

59:53.600 --> 59:55.480
but some people like it.

59:55.480 --> 59:59.560
And you've seen, even on some of the low end Mac products,

59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.160
some pretty high resolutions.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.720
Yeah, well, there are some bad sides to this.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:09.480
It's got USB-C, but that is not Thunderbolt.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.960
So there's no external graphics to be had.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.240
But then again, I'm not gonna go buy

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.160
an external enclosure and a graphics card.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.840
If I want a serious graphics card,

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.040
I'll put it in my desktop machine.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:19.880
Thank you very much.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.520
This is supposed to be light and portable.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.880
Was that a dig at Mr. Martin Wimpress

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.320
on a day that he's not here?

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.960
Well, I just don't really understand

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.840
why you would use that.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:35.480
If you're tethered to a desk and an external screen anyway,

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.080
why not just use a proper desktop machine?

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:39.320
I don't understand all this Thunderbolt business,

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.000
but I know some people are into it.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.880
And storage as well, obviously,

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.800
is gonna be faster over Thunderbolt.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.120
But it has got some full size old school USB,

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.200
although they are 3.1, so that's nice.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.800
And it's got DisplayPort and full size HDMI

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:58.040
and an SD card slot and gigabit ethernet.

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.320
You don't often get that these days on an ultrabook.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.640
And that's important when you have

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.760
a lot of WAV files to upload.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.920
Yeah, exactly.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.240
And it's also got a headphone jack,

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.600
which you can't really take for granted these days,

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.440
can you?

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.280
No, you have to check.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.120
It's a little awkward.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.000
It's sort of like trying to be like, what's going on here?

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.040
You're holding it up to the light.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.400
Oh yeah, there it is.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.000
Okay, so there's some questions in the IRC

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:19.840
I just have to ask.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:22.680
As someone who has used one but never bought one,

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.520
is this just a rebadged Clevo?

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.040
What's going on with Entryware?

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.120
Well, Clevo is the ODM,

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:33.280
but there are some less scrupulous vendors,

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:36.320
resellers, you might say, who just buy Clevo stuff

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.960
and then just sell it.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.920
Whereas what Entryware does is they very carefully

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.400
select the parts.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.600
It's a Clevo chassis,

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.400
but they make sure that the parts

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.920
that they're putting inside this thing

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:52.680
actually are going to work with Linux properly.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:55.000
And they also make sure that the firmware

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.360
and everything's working.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.360
And that's why there are some vendors

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:03.320
who punt out the new Clevo machines quite quickly

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.960
without fully testing this firmware stuff.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.400
Whereas Entryware sometimes wait a little bit

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.960
and make sure that everything is going to work.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:15.040
And that was my first impression of it with Ubuntu.

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.120
Okay, I don't really like GNOME.

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:21.480
I think it's fair to say, but it worked perfectly.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.160
Everything worked as you should.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.440
It was a very good experience.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.720
It was very much a stock Ubuntu installation.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:31.960
It wasn't long before I put Xubuntu on it, obviously.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.040
But from what I saw of the Ubuntu installation,

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.520
it was very stock and everything just worked perfectly.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.920
And with Xubuntu as well, so far, so good.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.160
I've not come into any problems at all.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.440
See, that's a really good point

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.160
because there aren't that many ODMs in the world.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.680
And so really whatever you buy,

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.800
you're just hoping that the person who assembled it

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.120
did a good job of choosing equivalent parts.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.760
So if you've got a little bit of a guarantee

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.600
that, oh, well, the people who sold me this

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.320
are at least aware that Linux is a thing.

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.640
And in this case, actually optimize for it.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.600
Well, it might not be the fanciest.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.800
It might not have the smallest bezels,

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.760
but it'll run Ubuntu.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.800
Yeah, someone's asking about a suspend in the IRC.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.720
I've never suspended a laptop.

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:15.080
Once you've got an NVMe drive in there,

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:18.240
it boots so quickly that there's just no need to suspend it.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:19.400
Oh, really?

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:20.520
See, that's funny.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.720
I feel like I used to have that.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.280
That was my workflow for a long time,

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:27.920
but now I just close my laptop lid and forget about it.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:28.760
I don't know.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:31.440
I just like to have it either on or off.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.960
I mean, it's not secure.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:35.120
It's not, you know, that's totally reasonable.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.000
And it's nice to actually reboot your machine,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.800
that your update didn't work anything, all of those things.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.720
I'm just surprised.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.960
I'm so used to, I just don't even,

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.160
it goes probably weeks without rebooting.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.000
Yeah, I don't know.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.160
I reboot my machines all the time

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.640
because now that storage is so fast,

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.040
this thing, you turn it on,

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:54.040
and before you've even taken a sip of your drink,

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.160
it's booted.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:58.000
So, you know, that's the same with all modern machines

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.640
with decent storage in them.

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:02.840
So for me, suspend's just not really a thing anymore.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.800
The nice part too is if you don't reboot

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.120
all the time, then you forget what you have to do

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.320
when you reboot, maybe adding SSH keys

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.080
or entering permissions or re-logging into something.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:14.200
And of course, the moment that you have rebooted

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.720
is probably the time that you really didn't want to.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.200
Yeah, exactly.

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:20.840
One nice thing about this is it's got a 2.5 bay as well.

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.800
So if you want to put spinning rust in it

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:26.640
or a larger SATA SSD, you can do that.

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.440
I'm not going to do that, I don't think.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:32.800
I've got a 500 gig Samsung SSD NVME in there,

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.520
which I think will do me for now.

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:36.720
But it's good to know that I've got that option

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.680
if I want to.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.520
Yeah, right.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.760
That's something that you always want to look for is,

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.880
is this serviceable?

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:42.800
Will it have a lifetime?

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.360
Can I upgrade it when I want and need to?

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.400
Now, most users might not, but in our audience, well,

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.920
that's a great way to get more life out of your machine.

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:55.040
Yeah, well, as for upgrading it, it's really, really easy.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.120
It's like 10 screws or something.

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.520
And then the bottom just comes off

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.440
and it supports up to 32 gigs of RAM, which is really nice.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:06.240
So you can get all the VMs essentially running on it.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.480
It's easy to take that for granted.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.080
I mean, I've owned several laptops

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:11.640
where you have to take the whole main board out before you can

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:12.840
even get to the hard drive.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.040
So the fact that it's 10 screws and, you know,

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.880
Bob's Joggle, great.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:20.480
Yeah, you can upgrade both storage and the RAM.

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.680
It's very user serviceable.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.600
And you could even swap out the fan and stuff

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.760
if you wanted to, you know, down the line

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.880
if anything goes wrong with that.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:30.320
So yeah, pretty impressed with it so far.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.800
But yeah, I can't really say that I've

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.000
lived with it long enough, so maybe I'll

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.800
have to give you an update at some point.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:41.080
Is this going to become a distro review machine or just

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.440
a mobile workstation for you?

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.560
No, very much not.

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:46.840
It means that my old, old laptop is

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:50.000
going to become the full-time distro review machine.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.880
This is very much production.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:54.360
I've got my main desktop for main production,

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:58.000
but this is my take to Linux Fest Northwest machine.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.800
And so it'll be probably Zubon 2, you said?

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.040
Yeah, yeah, Zubon 2.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.680
No, no deviance there.

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:06.560
All right, that makes perfect sense.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:09.240
Thank you for that mini preview of the intro.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.640
I'm sure we're going to find out a lot more as you actually

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:12.440
use this machine.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.840
I'll be curious to give it a hands-on look when

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.840
I get to see you at Linux Fest Northwest.

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.800
That's a great chance.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:20.000
We should just talk about Linux Fest Northwest.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.680
It's their 20th anniversary this year.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:25.840
And if you've never gone before, it's a great time to go.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.680
We've got links to all of that and everything

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.800
we talked about today, linuxunplugged.com

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.360
slash 283.

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:37.800
Now, Joe, I'm just ever so grateful that you came and hung

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.360
out here with us today.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.080
Where can the audience go to find more of you?

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.600
Well, Linux Action News is a good one,

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.320
linuxactionnews.com and error.show.

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.840
If you want to listen to User Error,

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:51.640
that's me and Popey and Dan from elementary talking

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.400
about life, the universe, and everything,

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.320
and a bit of Linux chucked in there.

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:56.520
So yeah, check those two out.

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:58.440
And also, lateknightlinux.com.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:01.040
If you want to hear me effing and blinding,

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.200
effing and a jeffing.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:05.160
And you almost always do.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:08.720
Thank you to our wonderful Mumble Room, as always.

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.920
And of course, the IRC and everyone else

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.560
in the Jupyter Broadcasting community,

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.440
linuxunplugged.com slash contact if you

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.520
want to send us some of your favorite things,

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:19.600
either interesting finds, questions, or just

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.800
your comments and feedback.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.400
We love it all.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.240
For all the other Jupyter Broadcasting shows,

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.800
go to JupyterBroadcasting.com.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.800
Thank you so much for joining us.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.840
We're going to get out of here, but don't worry.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.920
There's lots of good stuff to look forward to.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.440
I'm always excited about the next User Error release.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:37.360
Just let me say, Joe.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.320
So good job.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.800
Thank you for joining us.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:44.720
And I think we're going to see you next Tuesday.

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.200
Come on, Wes.

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.000
You can do better than that.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:46.880
Next Tuesday.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.080
Yeah, you're right.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:48.640
Tuesday!

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:55.160
Hey!

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:32.740
So, I just got my father an iPad, mostly so he could read some, like, journalism, you

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:39.700
know, various apps from bigger newspapers than his tiny, dying hometown newspaper.

01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:43.780
And he used, like, a Windows, oh, I don't know, was it an XP machine?

01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:46.420
I don't know, whatever his, before he retired, right?

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:50.080
And so he has this very particular interface with computers, and I've got, I've got my

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:54.800
mom on Linux now, and part of me wonders, he might just actually take to the command

01:08:54.800 --> 01:09:01.440
line, because it's sort of a conversation, and less of an exploration visually.

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:05.400
And so, like, but Bash is kind of arcane, and if you know what you're doing with Bash

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:11.040
or CSH or really any shell, you can obviously configure most of the stuff that you find.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:15.560
But with Phish, it just, like, it really is friendly, and that friendly only goes so far,

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:20.760
and once you're an expert, you probably don't care about friendly, but for new users, like,

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.400
if you first got a Phish shell and then you learned Bash, there's probably a lot of Bash

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.080
things that you would think were so silly.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:31.920
Don't you find that Phish kind of does things by itself too much, though?

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:36.520
At least with Bash, you type stuff in, you press enter, okay, you've got tab completion,

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:39.480
but if you don't know about that, you're not going to get it, whereas you start typing

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:42.880
and then just things happen, and you're like, it's a bit scary for people who don't know

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:43.880
what they're doing.

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.680
Okay, I can see that.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.040
You probably do need, in, like, a basic introduction, you probably do need a little bit about that.

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.440
Like, you probably have to touch on that feature.

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:57.060
It feels like, to me, you have to have used Bash and have some vague understanding of

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:59.760
how it works before you could use Phish.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:04.880
I guess I could see that with the very, very present autocomplete, I could see that being

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:05.880
confusing.

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.880
Yeah.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:12.760
But I wonder if you started off from a blank shell, like, with no autocomplete history,

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:16.320
and if it would make more sense that it would, like, if it was only commands that they had

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:19.640
typed that got suggested to them again, if that would be better.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.640
I don't know.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:24.160
It'd be an interesting experience in user experience research.

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.160
Yeah.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:28.760
I can't see many companies putting money into that, though, unfortunately.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.640
No, no, that's exactly what I was thinking.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:43.480
No one's, no one's wondering that.
