WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:05.320
All right, so here's what here's essentially what my the last like week and a half has been like so

00:06.360 --> 00:09.760
Starting last week. I was out at a clients, and I was working and

00:10.400 --> 00:13.440
My kids every time they get sick it kind of like passes around

00:13.440 --> 00:17.300
It's like we're gonna rather Rosie, and then we all die right and around Sunday

00:17.300 --> 00:20.440
I started to get sick the Sunday that I arrived there now

00:20.440 --> 00:25.260
That's a Sunday that feeling prior with starting this is Sunday prior to election day, right?

00:25.660 --> 00:28.240
so Sunday and Monday, I kind of stick it out not too bad and

00:28.240 --> 00:35.120
Around Monday Tuesday it starts to kind of sink in right after the election start to lose my voice start to get super stick start

00:35.120 --> 00:37.840
Throwing up start coughing. Yeah, it's bad and

00:39.000 --> 00:43.920
Go basically the rest of the week like that get home Friday late late Friday

00:44.880 --> 00:47.720
and I thought well, I'm gonna take the weekend and just

00:48.840 --> 00:50.840
hyper hyper rest

00:51.200 --> 00:55.640
Lots and lots of rest lots and lots of water lots and lots of good food try to fix yourself

00:55.640 --> 01:01.040
Yeah, I'm gonna kick myself back into gear so that I can be here ready to roll on Monday

01:01.960 --> 01:05.240
So that's what I do Friday that what I little time I have on Friday

01:06.560 --> 01:08.560
Saturday and Sunday

01:09.120 --> 01:15.320
Monday get a super important call, and I decide I have to go into a client to take care of something before I leave town

01:16.320 --> 01:22.160
So I look at the seats available, and I find out that there aren't a lot of flights to Seattle anyway

01:22.160 --> 01:27.760
So I go take care of the client and I get to the airport fly over to Minneapolis

01:27.760 --> 01:29.680
Which is the only place you can fly out of Grand Forks?

01:29.680 --> 01:35.560
And I spend nine and a half hours in the airport trying to get flights to Seattle

01:36.160 --> 01:40.760
We get to 1045 at night, and it turns out we're not going to get to Seattle

01:40.760 --> 01:43.680
There's just no way flights are not gonna happen so I

01:44.320 --> 01:50.120
Call Rekind I'm like dude. I am exhausted. I have had four or five hours of sleep

01:50.120 --> 01:52.240
I have been here for nine and a half hours

01:52.240 --> 01:53.920
I don't know how to get to Seattle and

01:53.920 --> 01:57.400
I just I don't know what I'm gonna be able to do and Rekind says well

01:57.400 --> 02:00.040
We got to find something so him, and I spend like an hour

02:01.100 --> 02:05.640
looking at every possible flight between Minneapolis st. Paul Airport and

02:06.680 --> 02:10.760
Seattle Airport where did those two intersect well turns out Boise, Idaho is

02:11.440 --> 02:15.140
A city that nobody wants to go to or from from either

02:15.360 --> 02:19.080
Minneapolis or Seattle and so they have 68 seats available, and so I'm all right

02:19.080 --> 02:20.400
I'm gonna go I'm gonna go get on that flight

02:20.400 --> 02:23.360
So I go hop on on the flight to Boise the problem is the flight to Boise

02:23.480 --> 02:29.040
Doesn't leave until 1045 at night, so now I'm at the airport going on 12 hours, and I

02:29.680 --> 02:36.960
Fly to Boise, and I land in Boise at midnight flight back out of Boise into Seattle isn't till 645 the next morning

02:37.320 --> 02:40.560
so I go like lay down to try and get some sleep and

02:40.560 --> 02:48.360
Airport security guy comes and he's like excuse me sir you you can't sleep here you have to be outside of security well

02:49.120 --> 02:52.240
Inside a security they have nice soft little benches outside of security

02:52.240 --> 02:57.200
They have the anti-bum metal benches that have big bumps on them, so you can't actually sleep right

02:57.840 --> 03:04.400
So I'm I try it can't sleep can't sleep can't sleep about an hour in I get some sort of sinus

03:04.880 --> 03:07.080
plug infection something and

03:07.080 --> 03:10.760
It just makes my entire jaw and my face

03:10.760 --> 03:15.320
Just like this crippling pain that I can't I can't even I can't talk I can't breathe

03:15.320 --> 03:18.680
I can't do anything all I can do is concentrate about how much my face hurts

03:18.960 --> 03:22.920
So I look to see if there's like a little shop or something I can go get some some decongestant

03:22.920 --> 03:26.000
Well there is on the other frequent side of security, right?

03:26.680 --> 03:30.760
So I'm telegramming Rekai, and I'm like I need to get something you know arm

03:30.760 --> 03:34.680
I I don't know how I'm going to continue living like this because I really cannot take this

03:34.680 --> 03:39.960
So finally after four and a half hours or five and a half hours the security checkpoint opens back up

03:39.960 --> 03:43.960
I'm able to get through before I actually get through this the security line the

03:44.480 --> 03:46.840
Crippling pain goes away, so I'm well

03:46.840 --> 03:47.360
I mean yeah

03:47.360 --> 03:52.920
This is this is looking up so but I still go spend seventeen dollars on some decongestant stuff just to have on hand

03:52.920 --> 03:57.920
I just considered a mantis suicide pills because it was gonna be and I didn't take my own life from pain right seemed like a good

03:57.920 --> 04:02.960
Investment so I get those I get on the plane, and I'm like and thank God they had first-class available

04:02.960 --> 04:07.920
so I was I was like well, I'm actually gonna get to sleep well apparently everyone in first class on a

04:09.280 --> 04:14.040
645 a.m.. Flight wants to like have a social hour with the flight attendant right that's crazy

04:14.040 --> 04:17.200
So every 30 seconds the flight attendants is coming up, and she's like

04:18.040 --> 04:19.360
Hey there

04:19.360 --> 04:21.000
How do I?

04:21.000 --> 04:24.200
You know do you want anything to drink? Would you like a banana? Would you like toast?

04:24.200 --> 04:30.480
Would you like to add a bread like really what I'd like is for you to GTFO and just let me sleep right you know

04:30.480 --> 04:36.320
So I so I you know it's a it's a hour or something actually I entered the space-time continuum

04:37.200 --> 04:42.200
It took off at 645 and landed at 6 o'clock, which is kind of cool. That's great. Yeah, so

04:43.880 --> 04:46.600
So I land and and

04:47.840 --> 04:51.200
Or maybe it was I took off at 6 and we let I don't remember anymore

04:51.320 --> 04:56.960
but I land and all I want to do is get my just get a rental car and get to the studio and sleep and

04:56.960 --> 05:00.520
I pull on to i5 and it is

05:01.080 --> 05:07.640
Standstill traffic, and I'm like what is going on and so I'm flipping through the radio stations turns out

05:07.640 --> 05:13.060
There's this huge car accident takes me three and a half hours to drive from the airport to the studio

05:13.760 --> 05:20.820
And I finally get to the studio like I don't know 10 10 30 and I just crash right onto the couch

05:20.820 --> 05:28.660
No sooner does my face hit the the the cushion do I hear the deep rumbling voice of a beard going?

05:29.220 --> 05:35.300
Hey, Noah. It's you might want to get up because you got to be on air in 20 minutes. I'm like

05:36.620 --> 05:39.020
So I drag myself back up go into the shower

05:39.020 --> 05:41.060
And I have been trying not to use my voice

05:41.500 --> 05:45.140
for the past couple days for two reasons one is because it hurts and two is

05:45.340 --> 05:49.620
because I need to save what little of my voice I have left to do these two shows so

05:49.620 --> 05:50.740
all

05:50.740 --> 05:53.000
That to say that big long rant to say

05:54.020 --> 05:55.460
I

05:55.460 --> 06:01.340
Hear it's gonna be a fun. Yeah, it's gonna be a fun show and you get you know late-night jazz announcer Noah

06:01.340 --> 06:06.420
That's that's what it's gonna be and the thing is like I was talking to my mother and we're going back and forth and

06:06.420 --> 06:09.940
I'm like this is this is why my clients hire me though and

06:10.580 --> 06:13.900
Because when Noah says Noah's gonna get something done

06:13.900 --> 06:18.420
I will either get something done, or I will die in the process of trying to get something done

06:18.420 --> 06:23.900
But one way or another yeah, it's happening. It's very stressful for your family, but it works out great

06:23.900 --> 06:27.540
Yeah, yeah, well shit with you know we knew about the the JB trip

06:27.540 --> 06:33.500
Well, we didn't know a family perspective was we weren't aware that I was gonna be gone the week prior in Wisconsin

06:33.500 --> 06:36.380
I didn't find that out until late in the week. Yeah, that's rough

06:36.900 --> 06:40.380
so beard was kind enough to share his orange juice with me, so I

06:40.940 --> 06:45.540
Have I have I have orange juice and vitamin C that I'm gonna be sucking down on the whole show

06:45.540 --> 06:51.820
This is Linux Unplugged episode 171 for November 15th 2016

07:03.620 --> 07:11.100
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show where the current hosts have taken off and been replaced by the walking dead

07:11.100 --> 07:16.060
My name is Noah and joining me for the first time both of us here in the studio is Wes

07:17.900 --> 07:23.820
How's it going man, I think I'm doing better than you are I think so you know it's great to finally be here in studio

07:23.820 --> 07:27.700
I don't think we've ever done a show just you and I in the studio. I don't think so

07:27.700 --> 07:31.300
We've done it remote yeah, we've done remotely you and I well those are a lot of fun

07:31.300 --> 07:36.860
So this must be even more I agree I agree and hopefully if all goes well and according to plan

07:36.860 --> 07:41.500
I won't kill you by the end of the episode and Chris won't tell us when he gets back exactly yeah

07:41.500 --> 07:43.660
I didn't wipe out JB. That'll work out

07:43.660 --> 07:48.420
We have a super fun and exciting show, but no show is complete

07:48.420 --> 07:53.300
No show can even begin without first saying hello to our mumble room. Hello mumble room. How are you guys?

07:57.940 --> 07:59.780
Holy cow

07:59.780 --> 08:01.100
Full house well

08:01.100 --> 08:02.700
Thank you mumble room and yeah

08:02.700 --> 08:07.900
If if you didn't catch if this doesn't if it if my rent didn't make it into the pre-show this week

08:08.260 --> 08:12.060
Noah is doing jazz voice Noah because Noah is

08:13.060 --> 08:15.460
Practically dead, but I'm still here so

08:16.460 --> 08:22.680
The first thing we're gonna talk about today is something near and dear to my heart anyone that has known me for more than 10 minutes

08:22.680 --> 08:27.980
If you if you meet me on the street, or we're having a conversation in a restaurant the first thing

08:27.980 --> 08:29.980
I'm going to do is switch you to Linux and

08:29.980 --> 08:37.180
After that happens after you've been converted and after you are letting you that's going to know it's gonna happen. Yeah, I just did it happens

08:38.100 --> 08:43.240
After that happens though the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to give you direct communication like to me

08:43.960 --> 08:48.660
So that I can continue to troubleshoot your problems and so that you can communicate not like an animal

08:48.940 --> 08:51.220
And so I put people on telegram. Mm-hmm. I

08:52.380 --> 08:57.460
have so many telegram conversations that it it would take me a

08:57.460 --> 08:59.460
year to

09:00.460 --> 09:05.860
Just get through. I mean I'm scrolling right now right scrolling. I'm continuing to scroll. I'm continuing to scroll

09:06.340 --> 09:11.180
Continuing to scroll. I'm just I have telegram conversations with everyone so if he doesn't respond

09:11.180 --> 09:14.700
That's why yeah, that's why and here's a great way to get me to not respond if you send me like

09:15.220 --> 09:18.100
Seven messages in a row. It's not I'm not trying to be rude

09:18.100 --> 09:23.140
I just I literally like my brain does this weird thing where I'm like I'll just ought to get back to him like I can't

09:23.140 --> 09:28.260
I can't process that much information when the tech star goes off the screen. I just I can't keep up with you

09:28.260 --> 09:31.660
And then and then a lot of times I just forget so it's not me being rude

09:31.660 --> 09:33.260
I just I literally don't know

09:33.260 --> 09:37.200
Yeah, I have I have I have the memory fish of a I have the memory of a goldfish anyway

09:37.300 --> 09:41.820
So besides you don't need to do that. That's what the great feature of editing your messages are for

09:42.320 --> 09:46.940
Right exactly or maybe just you know composing a message one time and then sending it. You know, there's that

09:48.060 --> 09:50.580
so when signal messenger first came out I

09:50.580 --> 09:57.580
I was super excited because I saw this is possibly the only replacement for telegram

09:57.580 --> 10:01.300
I would have ever considered I am I've been very happy with

10:01.900 --> 10:06.100
Telegram and I've had no reason to want to leave telegram, but

10:07.660 --> 10:12.580
At the end of the day all of the security audits of telegram have come back and said

10:13.060 --> 10:15.320
We haven't found any problems with it per se

10:15.320 --> 10:20.920
But the way that they tell us that they want us to audit their security leads us to think that

10:21.120 --> 10:24.700
There may be some security holes that were unable to discover

10:25.720 --> 10:27.720
so introducing

10:27.920 --> 10:30.080
signal signal messenger is a

10:31.320 --> 10:32.760
encrypted

10:32.760 --> 10:35.800
Chat program that not only does chat but also does voice

10:37.040 --> 10:41.200
communication SMS that whole the whole nine yards and it went through a

10:41.200 --> 10:45.280
Crypto analysis and the results are in you can trust it

10:45.880 --> 10:47.880
Signal is secure

10:48.560 --> 10:55.640
So the article from the register.co.uk says encrypted SMS and voice app signal has passed a security audit with flying colors as

10:55.960 --> 11:03.160
Explained in a paper titled a formal security analysis of the signal message protocol published by the International Association of Cryptologic Research

11:03.360 --> 11:08.040
signal has no disc no discernible flaws and offers a well-designed and

11:08.040 --> 11:13.520
Compromise resistant architecture signal uses a double ratchet algorithm that employs in

11:14.680 --> 11:16.680
ephemeral key exchanges

11:16.840 --> 11:22.840
Continually during each session minimizing the amount of text that can be decrypted at any point should the key be compromised

11:23.240 --> 11:28.640
Signal was examined by a team of five researchers at the UK Australia and Canada namely Oxford University

11:29.140 --> 11:32.440
information security professor Cass Kramer and his PhDs

11:33.440 --> 11:36.660
catril cone garden and Luke Garrett

11:36.660 --> 11:43.980
Queensland University of Technology PhD Benjamin Dowling and McMaster University assistant professor Douglas Stabila

11:44.820 --> 11:47.100
so basically they went through and they looked at

11:47.780 --> 11:49.140
the

11:49.140 --> 11:51.060
this particular messenger

11:51.060 --> 11:52.020
And they said yeah

11:52.020 --> 11:54.020
It it's it's actually pretty secure

11:54.220 --> 12:00.500
Providing a security analysis for the signal protocol is a challenging for several reasons first signal employs a novel and

12:00.500 --> 12:08.420
Unstudied design of involving over ten different types of keys and a complex update process which leads to various chains of related keys

12:08.420 --> 12:12.580
It therefore does not directly fit into existing analysis models second

12:13.180 --> 12:16.540
Some of its claim properties have only recently been formalized

12:17.100 --> 12:23.400
Finally as a more mundane obstacle the protocol is substantially documented beyond its there is not

12:23.620 --> 12:27.260
Substantially documented beyond its source code now. That's an important point

12:27.920 --> 12:29.720
signal messenger the

12:29.720 --> 12:31.720
protocol of the server

12:32.020 --> 12:34.020
The entire thing from top to bottom

12:34.700 --> 12:40.780
Open source open code. Yep, you can look at it look at it modify it run it right so that makes me

12:41.500 --> 12:48.440
It makes it a very compelling product now. I tried it a couple weeks ago, and you know my experience was not great

12:48.440 --> 12:50.440
I had a crash a lot

12:51.740 --> 12:54.940
You know that was back when I was on a boat too, but I

12:54.940 --> 12:59.140
I the experience was definitely not as polished as telegram

12:59.140 --> 13:03.540
Did you try it on the phone no because I think you know that's kind of like where they started like they had

13:03.740 --> 13:05.540
Tech secure on Android for a long time

13:05.540 --> 13:10.100
and then they they had a different iOS app and then they kind of made signal and merge them together and finally it's merged and

13:10.100 --> 13:14.620
Then eventually got the the desktop app which I think is a Chrome app right isn't it really these days

13:15.620 --> 13:18.660
So like all electron. Yeah, yeah, it's electron app

13:18.660 --> 13:24.060
So they've come a long long way so that I can definitely see the desktop not being their primary focus at least hasn't yeah

13:24.060 --> 13:28.380
Yeah, and to be fair most of the time. I'm on telegram. I'm using it on my phone

13:28.380 --> 13:30.380
But you know on the other side of the coin

13:30.900 --> 13:36.180
Telegram has made the Linux desktop client a huge priority for them really is it's a very good client

13:36.180 --> 13:42.780
I mean honestly I use it more because I like it as a chat program than it has a security chat program exactly

13:43.060 --> 13:47.420
How about you the desktop version of telegram doesn't even have security at all anyway?

13:48.300 --> 13:53.740
Well, it's still encrypted. It's just like yeah, it's encrypted from this. It's not encrypted

13:53.740 --> 13:58.320
It's it's from server to server like everything on the server is not encrypted

13:58.900 --> 14:04.320
Say what no if on their server when you use the secure chat feature in telegram

14:04.320 --> 14:07.500
That's encrypted when you're not using that it's not encrypted

14:07.500 --> 14:13.180
I was under the impression that the difference within the secure chat and the regular chats were the secure chat the private key is on

14:13.180 --> 14:14.740
your device only

14:14.740 --> 14:16.660
whereas the

14:16.660 --> 14:21.220
Regular chat it's still encrypted, but they hold the key on their server so that it can do synchronization

14:21.220 --> 14:28.660
What'd you but the fact that you can edit it on on both parties means that it's not really secured

14:29.660 --> 14:31.560
Okay, because it's on their server editable

14:31.560 --> 14:37.140
So it's not yeah secure and so that's just like it comes back like telegrams the thing that I try to get my family

14:37.140 --> 14:41.200
On because you know end of the day if we're spied on that's alright

14:41.200 --> 14:46.220
But for people you know that have more real concerns are more concerned about that lead different lives sure cool enough

14:46.220 --> 14:50.500
You know we could have even more trust in open whisper systems and signal in particular. Yeah, yeah

14:50.500 --> 14:53.580
They have a choice anyone in the mumble room actually used whisper. What do you think of it?

14:54.500 --> 15:00.300
Yeah, I use it. I used it when it was tech secure then it became signal, and then it combined red phone

15:00.780 --> 15:06.000
Right into signal. Thank you, and it's uh. It's all it's really good and

15:06.980 --> 15:12.100
It also could do tell on text messages for SMS on signal on the the phone version

15:12.260 --> 15:18.600
So it's it's really cool because it also gives you like a notification whether this this particular conversation is encrypted or not

15:18.600 --> 15:22.040
So like if someone else is using signal

15:22.040 --> 15:28.280
But you're you there or you're using the SMS feature, and they're also using signal as their SMS

15:28.280 --> 15:32.600
It will just automatically convert it into a signal thing so that's really cool

15:33.120 --> 15:34.920
But what can yeah?

15:34.920 --> 15:40.940
What confuses me is more like how do they have the keys shared between devices for conversations that are encrypted?

15:41.400 --> 15:45.200
From phone to phone and then move to the desktop right it's an electron app

15:45.200 --> 15:48.480
It's like I don't I don't even see how it works. That's a good question, but

15:49.480 --> 15:56.860
Just to be one more thing is really interesting to know that that signal protocol is also used by Facebook really

15:57.520 --> 15:59.520
Yeah, they're messenger

16:00.240 --> 16:03.120
Yeah, and what's that? Yeah, it's too bad

16:03.120 --> 16:08.720
They won't let that messenger be like it's the thing is when Facebook started forcing you to install messenger

16:08.720 --> 16:14.840
That's when I stopped using messenger second. I just I don't play that game. Yeah anyone else in the mobile room use signal

16:14.840 --> 16:16.840
What do you think of it?

16:18.000 --> 16:22.120
Nobody when I installed it I installed it, but I have no friends using it so

16:23.000 --> 16:27.480
Very difficult to to really convert them the canonical chat platform

16:29.200 --> 16:32.240
That's the problem if you don't have anybody to get on there

16:32.240 --> 16:35.480
It's a little point in having it right I have I have telegram

16:35.480 --> 16:40.200
But that that got started pretty slowly, and I just met new people there right

16:40.200 --> 16:46.800
Mm-hmm yeah, and you know if you think about it any social networking platform any chat platform any communication platform

16:47.200 --> 16:51.300
Really what it amounts to is you're gonna be where your friends are right? Yeah, and I think that's why

16:52.000 --> 16:56.800
things like g-plus and Facebook have reason to such prominence and in Twitter because

16:57.040 --> 17:02.240
So many people are already there. It just becomes natural. I mean I remember back when I was in high school

17:03.760 --> 17:06.240
MSN messenger was the way that everyone communicated right and

17:06.240 --> 17:11.000
Nobody used it when MSN messenger started to die was when Facebook took off

17:11.000 --> 17:16.840
Yeah, because they had an integrated messenger, and so why would you why would you have friends on MSN?

17:17.200 --> 17:20.240
When you could just chat through Facebook, it just doesn't make a lot of sense

17:21.440 --> 17:27.960
So well what's up? I remember the same thing I used to be on Yahoo messenger and MSN messenger

17:28.520 --> 17:34.200
Isn't it funny how we just kind of go rotate through chat platforms. Yep. I just have everyone on aim

17:34.200 --> 17:38.320
Yeah, I'm not died. Yeah, I see Q like j-core says and IRC

17:41.920 --> 17:48.360
IRC is still around and we're still using yes. Yeah. Yeah, there's a guy never got on IRC until like three years ago

17:48.560 --> 17:52.460
You know I think that's actually kind of it seems like the PRC has kind of had a resurgence at least in the

17:53.120 --> 17:57.640
Tech crowd oh for sure yeah, I was I was on the original ICQ

17:57.640 --> 18:03.880
You know why IRC has got a resurgence because slack has an IRC. Oh, yeah, there you go. Oh, yeah

18:03.920 --> 18:08.360
Yeah, that's that's a big thing and if you think about it really slack is just IRC for 2016

18:14.360 --> 18:20.760
What is right I'm a huge fan of riot and matrix tell me about it um so

18:21.880 --> 18:27.080
Matrix is a way to do federated chat so you can it's sort of similar to diaspora

18:27.080 --> 18:30.960
But for just a chat protocol and so you have all these disparate home servers

18:30.960 --> 18:34.680
And you have usernames at the home servers hosted on a domain

18:34.840 --> 18:37.520
And so it's kind of federated in the same way email is

18:37.760 --> 18:43.280
So if I'm at one server with my name I can send to another server with that name and they connect to each other and start

18:43.280 --> 18:49.000
Sending messages back and forth got the server store the seat and then you log into the servers using some client like riot

18:49.800 --> 18:54.240
That's really the biggest one actually you may have heard of it. I don't know of many others before they used to be

18:54.240 --> 18:57.440
Okay, yeah, yeah, but one of the neat things about it is like

18:57.440 --> 19:01.480
I think they kind of build themselves as the the missing signaling layer for web RTC

19:01.480 --> 19:06.160
So they support web RTC kind of you know yes as a first-party platform and the same time

19:06.160 --> 19:10.600
It's really the signaling part really shines through so it really is good at like they have a lot of different bridges

19:10.680 --> 19:16.480
IRC bridges slack bridges sure rocket ship bridges and so like it's a it seems and the nice thing is you can host your own

19:16.480 --> 19:20.400
Without having to deal with someone else's server directly you always just talk to your own local instance

19:20.400 --> 19:22.400
And then it goes out and federates with other people

19:22.400 --> 19:25.620
And on top of that it also has bridges for slack and IRC

19:26.800 --> 19:30.160
All of your conversations in there like you know like a modern web

19:31.000 --> 19:37.100
HTTP json focused yeah bridge that can just take glue that you can take between I actually like it more than using quassel for IRC

19:37.100 --> 19:40.580
I have all my IRC pumped through a matrix Helm server really that's which is super nice

19:40.760 --> 19:44.760
Yeah, and then I just use riot on like my phone or in my browser. I will have to try that

19:45.040 --> 19:48.820
It's pretty cool. There's a lot of infrastructure you to set up, but it's pretty nice once you get it running

19:48.820 --> 19:53.020
So now how do you have a setup on your phone? Oh the phone?

19:53.020 --> 19:57.500
There's an app so iOS and Android have a riot app right now. You can talk to your own home server

19:59.120 --> 20:03.660
So ham radio you were saying that they're going to be discontinuing along a lot of the Google apps

20:04.780 --> 20:09.820
Yeah, I heard that Google next year is going to be disabling the Google apps on Chrome

20:09.820 --> 20:13.780
And so that means that the desktop client for signal is going to be going away

20:13.780 --> 20:18.180
Huh, okay, and that does not know doesn't mean that

20:19.220 --> 20:21.220
Okay, what does mean then?

20:21.220 --> 20:25.540
Anything running on electron can run on electron because that's a completely different framework

20:25.780 --> 20:30.620
It's Google is room is eliminating the apps that are inside of the chrome store

20:31.280 --> 20:36.800
So like they're like you won't be able to be able to install apps from there. Why are they removing it?

20:36.800 --> 20:40.060
I thought that was a big thing part of the whole Chrome OS thing Chromebook

20:40.060 --> 20:44.300
they're saying that the whole point of those ass was to be able to use offline and

20:44.900 --> 20:48.180
They're saying that the majority of people who use those apps do not use them offline

20:48.580 --> 20:52.820
So it doesn't really benefit them to even have that infrastructure available

20:53.420 --> 20:58.200
That makes sense, but if I go to open whisper systems website, there's no

20:58.940 --> 21:03.800
Download our look on app. It's you have to download it through the Google Chrome store

21:03.800 --> 21:09.520
So, yeah, but they could convert it more than likely like it's mainly that the bit there what they're

21:09.520 --> 21:14.400
Just they're removing is the offline features and because signal is a online only thing

21:16.360 --> 21:21.400
Well as far as like is sending the conversations back and forth right it makes sense they could just switch it but

21:21.720 --> 21:25.720
They're not that's good. It's gonna be for at least another year. I guess we'll have to wait and see

21:27.640 --> 21:32.160
They're actually doing it they're just gradually doing it most of the rest you'll be doing it for like a year

21:32.160 --> 21:36.360
They're just gradually doing it most of the rest you had a comment about why IRC is coming making a research

21:37.720 --> 21:44.160
Actually wasn't really that it was speaking of research. It's just that I can remember using it before the internet became big and

21:45.320 --> 21:46.920
as

21:46.920 --> 21:50.120
Things went on a lot of people that were on like, you know

21:50.120 --> 21:53.480
The old-school BBS is and all that kind of stuff if they wanted to keep in touch with each other

21:53.600 --> 21:59.200
They ended up just sliding over to IRC because it gave them the same kind of setup as well

21:59.200 --> 22:02.600
I RC unlike let me see if I can get the theme here

22:03.200 --> 22:05.760
MSN messenger Yahoo messenger

22:06.680 --> 22:12.600
AIM if you're not getting the theme the theme is that they're all branded IRC is not branded

22:12.600 --> 22:20.720
It's just kind of there. It's sort of like hey, it's a library. It's called a library. It's not Roger's library or

22:21.560 --> 22:24.480
Verizon's library, it's a library you go to the library, right?

22:24.480 --> 22:30.280
Sure, so it was the same thing with IRC just anyone had it and he would access it

22:30.480 --> 22:34.560
The servers were all over the place. You just kind of went there. So it wasn't

22:35.560 --> 22:39.960
Attached to any one particular company. So it wasn't a matter of hey

22:39.960 --> 22:43.840
I don't like this company or hey this company how it now has you know

22:43.840 --> 22:48.560
These flashy little ball things that wink at you and stuff like that. It was just kind of there

22:48.560 --> 22:53.320
All right. Anyone else any thoughts on signal messenger? So

22:55.280 --> 23:01.120
They conclude that it's impossible to say if signal if signal meets its goals as there are none stated

23:01.120 --> 23:06.640
but what their analysis did say is approves that it's it it satisfies security standards and

23:07.200 --> 23:09.340
They add that we have found no major flaws

23:09.880 --> 23:16.240
So it's not definitive but it's a kind of the first the first ratchet if you along the way towards it being trusted

23:16.240 --> 23:23.520
All right. Now this next story as you can imagine it has me super excited and that is that the new MacBook

23:24.200 --> 23:26.200
doesn't run Linux

23:26.520 --> 23:33.120
So there was a gentleman that did a very comprehensive write-up in the Ubuntu

23:33.700 --> 23:38.760
subreddit and basically he took his brand new 2015 MacBook and

23:40.240 --> 23:43.120
Went through and said here's what I tried to do

23:43.120 --> 23:46.440
Here's I tried to get Linux to work and here's why it doesn't work. Basically

23:48.240 --> 23:50.040
It the

23:50.040 --> 23:56.600
The first problem is that you can't even get past the grub screen. So you can't even actually get Linux to boot

23:58.240 --> 24:02.040
Secondly if you can actually get into Linux the built-in keyboard and mouse don't work

24:02.560 --> 24:05.480
Only the power only the power key works to force

24:06.160 --> 24:09.620
The the reboot and he tried this on the non touch bar version

24:09.620 --> 24:16.420
He says that there's a patch for the 2015 MacBook that may work for it, but he's not obviously entirely sure

24:17.180 --> 24:24.340
Any links to the driver and we'll have that in the show notes and the biggest problem is that the NVMe drive?

24:24.700 --> 24:28.420
has the wrong PCI class ID so

24:29.180 --> 24:34.280
Linux doesn't actually see it as a bootable device. So you can't boot off the built-in hard drive

24:34.280 --> 24:40.360
Which by the way, if you look at Louis Rossman's breakdown of it, they used like some

24:41.160 --> 24:43.160
fancy special connector that is

24:43.800 --> 24:50.400
You know only available to them and that particular computer so you can't just replace the drive

24:50.880 --> 24:53.560
The thing is a walking disaster

24:54.120 --> 24:56.600
Another thing is like the input devices. He was saying they don't work

24:56.600 --> 24:59.520
That's because they're over the SPI bus and said right USB bus, right?

24:59.520 --> 25:01.960
It really is quite a different machine than we've seen before

25:01.960 --> 25:08.320
This thing is a disaster. Yeah, I was glad to see that at least some of the people in the reddit thread world, you know

25:08.320 --> 25:10.600
Thank like being like well at least thank you for sharing right?

25:10.600 --> 25:12.160
I know some people turn to the like

25:12.160 --> 25:14.200
You know like you should have checked and like yeah

25:14.200 --> 25:19.560
Probably if you weren't willing to spend that that money check to see if it's Linux compatible right given like the history of Macs

25:19.600 --> 25:24.420
But it is it is a nice donation to the field of maybe we can eventually get something work sure

25:24.940 --> 25:30.480
You know and the thing is is there's oh, there's a lot of chat in this in the subreddit about well actually

25:30.480 --> 25:36.080
There's a lot of chat in general the community of we need to be ready to accept Mac users when they come over to us

25:36.080 --> 25:42.720
I think a certain amount of time should be spent on that and then I think we should start focusing on

25:42.880 --> 25:46.040
the manufacturers that aren't actively working on these like

25:46.640 --> 25:52.400
One-off models that are just freaking crazy. You know, it's one thing to you know

25:53.080 --> 25:55.760
Take a Lenovo machine and swap a wireless card in it

25:55.760 --> 26:00.960
It's one thing to open a you know, the Adele and and you know

26:00.960 --> 26:03.640
Put a different wireless card in it or put a different sound card or something like that

26:04.560 --> 26:11.440
It's something entirely different when the manufacturer makes a totally separate hard drive that is barely related to

26:11.880 --> 26:14.480
What we know as computers everything

26:16.280 --> 26:17.780
Exactly

26:17.780 --> 26:19.320
exactly, it's just

26:19.320 --> 26:24.320
The amount of time that I would like to see the the Linux community doing that

26:24.320 --> 26:32.440
For a couple of reasons one is I don't know that I even necessarily agree that there are droves of people that are buying

26:32.440 --> 26:36.040
a 2015 MacBook and then wanting to put Linux on it

26:36.920 --> 26:40.200
Think of you're in the market for a to think of you're on the market and you're willing to make a compromise

26:40.680 --> 26:44.080
For a laptop that's limited to 16 gigs of RAM and doesn't have an escape key

26:44.400 --> 26:47.600
You're probably buying that computer because you wanted macOS to begin with

26:48.240 --> 26:50.200
so I

26:50.200 --> 26:52.760
Don't know that that's a really valuable use of our time

26:52.760 --> 26:59.720
But secondly if we really want to take people over and we really want to be there for Mac users

26:59.880 --> 27:05.560
Then they can sell their Macbooks and buy something like a system 76. It's gonna work right out of the box with Linux, you know

27:06.880 --> 27:09.880
I'd be interested what you guys in the mumble room think I

27:12.160 --> 27:17.400
Think it's crazy that you have that 16 gig limitation on something so expensive

27:17.400 --> 27:24.520
I mean I have 16 gigs on a T for 20 from 2011 so but it's he 420 has so much more space on the motherboard

27:24.520 --> 27:31.080
And the chassis you have to kind of understand what Apple's constraints are for their motherboard and layout of devices and such things

27:31.600 --> 27:34.440
Well, they're only getting one dim in there effectively

27:34.440 --> 27:38.720
Even though I think it's actually soldered on but it's the capacity of one dim in one controller, right?

27:39.600 --> 27:44.480
So it's until they make 32 gig dims. They're not gonna have 32 gigs available

27:44.480 --> 27:49.480
Yeah, but you know the answer that I've seen for that is that they wanted they wanted to keep it smaller because they wanted

27:49.480 --> 27:51.820
More room for the battery exactly, but hold on

27:52.680 --> 27:57.280
That stands up to reason until they say well until we reach 100 watt hours

27:57.280 --> 27:59.280
And then we don't want to go over that

27:59.560 --> 28:05.960
Because the airline the airlines wouldn't let you take a laptop on on a plane and I looked into this that's total BS

28:06.080 --> 28:10.080
The airline restricts external batteries over a certain

28:10.080 --> 28:14.000
Oh and I don't remember off the top of my head what it is X external batteries are restricted

28:14.000 --> 28:17.760
So you can't separate on your big pack of right now separate batteries

28:17.760 --> 28:22.480
You can't take on and only that you can take that on carry-on. It just can't be checked in luggage

28:23.240 --> 28:26.400
Internal batteries things that are inside of a device. There is no limit

28:26.400 --> 28:30.920
So you could have if you can find a way to get a five thousand, you know

28:31.640 --> 28:37.160
What our battery attached to a laptop as long as it's in case the in the laptop generator in that whatever day

28:37.160 --> 28:42.560
Yeah, exactly. You can take that puppy put it in a laptop bag. Check it in the baggage compartment

28:42.560 --> 28:46.160
No problem from the FAA. So that's BS

28:47.320 --> 28:52.640
Now they might be limited to it to a single dim and I guess I can understand that the problem is

28:53.200 --> 28:55.200
It seems like they had two lines

28:55.640 --> 28:58.120
the MacBook Air seemed to target the

28:58.680 --> 29:04.840
Daily desktop user and the people who wanted light and thin exactly there were their focus exactly. I want a thin

29:05.600 --> 29:10.440
Daily driver laptop exactly exactly that seems like the appropriate place to put in

29:10.440 --> 29:17.080
You know 16 gigs of RAM and integrated graphics and stuff like that. The pro line has always been set aside for

29:18.480 --> 29:21.000
People that are doing more demanding tasks media tasks

29:21.800 --> 29:26.060
You know, well, what else do they have? I guess just media tasks, but people

29:28.840 --> 29:36.160
How much yeah, yeah, I guess you're running VMs so I don't understand Apple's decision to handy

29:36.160 --> 29:38.160
well, I guess I shouldn't say that I

29:38.160 --> 29:40.280
I understand their decision from this standpoint

29:41.840 --> 29:44.900
Even with as many MacBooks as you see at a conference

29:45.040 --> 29:51.420
They still don't really hold any significant share of the PC marketplace, right? I'm still under 10% Maybe 15, right?

29:51.840 --> 29:53.760
They're the outliers in the enterprise, right?

29:53.760 --> 29:55.040
So by and large

29:55.040 --> 30:02.800
Majority dominated by Windows right with Windows 10 no longer having a I mean as far as they say no longer having a newer and newer

30:02.800 --> 30:04.640
version of Windows

30:04.640 --> 30:10.420
They've lost the advantage of well buy this machine in the last two ten years or whatever and we'll just keep giving you updates

30:10.420 --> 30:13.880
No, Microsoft can make that claim at least for the time being right at the same time

30:13.960 --> 30:20.440
You look at tablets and smartphones and they are surging right a lot of people even die-hard Linux users

30:20.440 --> 30:23.840
Make compromises and go buy an iPhone or an iPad. Yeah, definitely

30:23.840 --> 30:29.480
So if you're the if you're a executive at Apple and you're sitting in your office and your primary

30:29.880 --> 30:33.260
Task is to make a lot of money and you look over here and you say

30:33.260 --> 30:38.600
We're selling iPhones out the wazoo and making bank on them and over here on this department

30:38.640 --> 30:41.640
We're still struggling to get a real grasp on the marketplace

30:43.080 --> 30:45.560
Where are you gonna spend your R&D? Where are you gonna spend your time?

30:45.560 --> 30:48.560
Where are you gonna spend pushing all of the stuff together?

30:48.560 --> 30:52.480
If you look at the latest version of Mac OS it resembles now more than ever

30:53.560 --> 30:58.960
iOS right, so I think that there is a I think there's a real chance

30:58.960 --> 31:03.720
That I think there's a real chance that what they're looking to do is

31:04.480 --> 31:09.480
Migrate iOS into Mac OS make them all one platform

31:10.200 --> 31:13.480
Let the people that are doing media production and all that stuff

31:14.200 --> 31:18.240
Port all their tools over to iOS and use all that stuff and

31:19.040 --> 31:23.520
Then just then they all they have to do is sell what they would call like an iPad Pro with it

31:23.520 --> 31:27.120
Oh wait, we already have that. You know what I mean? So it's just like at every turn

31:27.120 --> 31:30.080
It seems like they're continually doing that. I'd be interested if anyone has any feedback

31:30.080 --> 31:35.120
I think it plays into their history as well of just like, you know, but before they went Intel they had their own

31:35.120 --> 31:40.320
I mean not that their own architecture, but they you know, they used these power chips and they used Motorola chips and

31:40.880 --> 31:46.400
I think we just see what was almost more of a convenience or coincidence for them when it was like a large overlap with

31:46.400 --> 31:53.200
Our x86 based PC marketplace and I think we see iOS as sort of its own ecosystem its own architecture

31:53.200 --> 31:55.680
They're making their own processors or at least, you know having them fabulous

31:55.680 --> 32:01.920
Right, so I think that they've always viewed their desktops or Mac OS X in the same way

32:01.920 --> 32:03.600
It just doesn't look like it from the outside

32:03.600 --> 32:06.640
But now like with more with their touch bar and with their you know

32:06.640 --> 32:08.720
The arm chip sitting on their system on a chip right?

32:08.720 --> 32:12.960
Well, it really is like they see it as a whole platform as one thing and probably yeah

32:12.960 --> 32:16.480
It will form more into with iOS into their Mac ecosystem

32:17.520 --> 32:19.520
Mamoru, what are your thoughts?

32:19.520 --> 32:21.520
Honestly, I'm saying

32:21.520 --> 32:27.120
IOS is going to be better than Mac OS for professionals is I didn't say that

32:27.920 --> 32:35.040
Well, I don't think IOS would ever be for professionals if anything any professional that I know from

32:36.080 --> 32:39.840
Outside of Chris or Rekai or professionals. I know personally

32:40.800 --> 32:46.400
They don't use Mac anymore because of their hardware choices and their software choices. Yeah

32:46.400 --> 32:53.200
They're like they're done. They they've had it if if Matt doesn't you know cater to them and go look

32:53.200 --> 32:57.440
We have these awesome machines for editing. We got this rock solid OS, you know

32:57.440 --> 33:05.440
We're still working on Final Cut. If you don't grab those people you're gonna lose them and I don't see them doing that with their offerings

33:05.440 --> 33:09.280
Yeah, I agree. Yeah, we actually we had a we have a small production house in Grand Forks

33:09.920 --> 33:14.720
They're an offshoot of a local news agency and they have switched to Adobe

33:14.720 --> 33:22.640
Premiere on Windows boxes and the university. Yeah, and the university first they dumped. They originally dumped Final Cut Pro for

33:24.640 --> 33:31.840
For Premiere and and the new machines the new desktop machines are Windows boxes because they support all of their PCI capture stuff

33:32.400 --> 33:39.520
And they have repurposed the they had like a learning lab and those had a lot of IMAX and those have been repurposed for up with

33:40.080 --> 33:41.280
Adobe

33:41.280 --> 33:48.240
Premiere on on those IMAX so that when those students get up into the the later years and they're they're doing because then

33:48.240 --> 33:51.920
In your third and fourth year when you're doing journalism school, then you actually go do assignments, right?

33:52.720 --> 33:55.600
And so they're teaching them to do it on these IMAX in

33:56.160 --> 34:01.520
On Premiere because they already had these IMAX and then they're moving off onto these Windows machines where they're using Adobe

34:01.520 --> 34:06.960
So I've seen the exact same trend. However, I of course being the Linux guy that I am I

34:06.960 --> 34:12.080
Contacted a couple of guys that were teaching that particular video course at UND

34:12.880 --> 34:14.480
Switched them to Linux

34:14.480 --> 34:20.960
Got them editing all of their stuff under Linux and now this year is the first year that they are teaching in tandem with

34:21.120 --> 34:27.680
Premiere Lightworks, so it's gonna be done. Yeah, unfortunately, it's gonna be done on IMAX because that's where the that's where the lab is

34:28.000 --> 34:33.280
But the advantage of those students is they can take those they can take that software those things that they have learned

34:33.280 --> 34:36.560
Inside of that class and take it home and then they can edit there. So

34:37.040 --> 34:40.960
I actually haven't checked in with those guys to see how that's going. But um, you know at the end of last year

34:40.960 --> 34:45.920
That was my that was my understanding that that you know, they they saw that as being a really competitive advantage

34:46.560 --> 34:50.960
So I I have seen that I I have I have seen that trend as well with people moving off of OSX

34:51.200 --> 34:54.960
But I think what you have to consider is that there are a lot of people

34:55.360 --> 34:59.360
That change the definition of what a professional is right 15 years ago 20 years ago

34:59.360 --> 35:06.320
a video professional was somebody that showed up with a $65,000 camera and had either you had a studio camera

35:06.320 --> 35:10.560
You're recording inside of a studio or you had an electronic news gathering crew. So you had an ENG camera

35:11.360 --> 35:16.240
And you filmed and then you brought that back into an actual edit bay and you had and you know

35:16.240 --> 35:20.080
And you had you had a you had an actual hardware mixer where you took your audio

35:20.400 --> 35:25.760
Where you know everything was recording you could tweak all that stuff in you know live right there and you do all of your editing

35:25.760 --> 35:29.840
And then you produce it you take it to your editor and then that would go out and then that would get produced onto

35:30.080 --> 35:36.000
Some sort of published media like a DVD or VHS or whatever master sent and get stamped out exactly and we can send out, right?

35:36.640 --> 35:37.600
today

35:37.600 --> 35:44.080
The definition of a professional has changed Apple sees a professional as somebody who films on their iPhone

35:44.800 --> 35:51.380
Edits edits on iMovie and publishes on iTunes the New York Times fired the majority of their photographers

35:51.380 --> 35:56.740
And gave all of the reporters iPhones and said here they all have 64 gigs of RAM start clicking away

35:56.740 --> 35:58.740
I'm sure you'll get something that's usable

35:59.060 --> 36:05.700
Does that quote post? Huh? Well, you know, yes, but I mean, you know, there was a there was actually I was looking

36:05.700 --> 36:07.220
I was watching a um

36:07.220 --> 36:11.860
Thing on still photography and they bought a bunch of Canon rebels put them all on auto mode

36:12.180 --> 36:15.780
Handed them to 50 people and said go take pictures of the sport events

36:16.500 --> 36:18.100
They had you know

36:18.100 --> 36:24.420
150,000 photos 148,000 of which were useless and then they found like six that they actually wanted to use

36:24.420 --> 36:30.420
But the cost to buy those cameras give them to people have them shoot was still cheaper than hiring like 10 real professional photographers

36:30.900 --> 36:37.220
So I think the definition of a professional is is rapidly changing. I think people on YouTube broadcasting themselves

36:37.860 --> 36:39.060
Are professionals, right?

36:39.060 --> 36:43.380
And Apple does a good job of hitting that like we have a pipeline and it's good enough for what you want to do

36:43.380 --> 36:45.380
I completely agree. They

36:45.380 --> 36:49.300
Put all of those tools in place. So my my question back to you, sir, is

36:50.020 --> 36:55.540
Is is it possible that Apple says they take all of the stuff in iOS and they just say all right. Here you go

36:55.860 --> 36:57.220
Let's make

36:57.220 --> 37:00.340
Let's make these tools available on iOS and push those out to people

37:02.820 --> 37:04.820
Just redefining what a professional is

37:06.180 --> 37:08.180
Or you're still not seeing it

37:09.380 --> 37:10.900
Maybe i'm totally off

37:10.900 --> 37:17.300
I I can say that they the fact that they're more switching to the prosumer grade. I don't think professional is really changing

37:17.540 --> 37:19.540
I think more

37:19.620 --> 37:22.500
More areas and industries are developing to become professional

37:22.820 --> 37:28.740
But I think the vast majority of people who are like professional youtubers are using professional gear

37:30.500 --> 37:35.140
Yeah, I I think that statement is true like you like you can use

37:35.700 --> 37:36.660
low-end

37:36.660 --> 37:41.780
prosumer stuff or consumer stuff, but eventually you will be going to

37:42.400 --> 37:48.740
Cannons and other rigs and you know professional XLR mics. It's just the road to get there pretty much

37:49.700 --> 37:51.300
so eventually

37:51.300 --> 37:55.300
I think any kind of prosumer that's not hardcore

37:56.420 --> 38:01.060
A studio or news journalists or anything like that from the past

38:01.060 --> 38:05.940
Will eventually want to demand tools from Apple and I think they're just going to have to give it to them eventually

38:06.660 --> 38:12.660
Andy Akers, you're saying that that you still define a professional photographer as somebody who can operate a camera in manual mode

38:12.980 --> 38:15.380
And it's essentially second nature to them

38:18.260 --> 38:20.260
Andy Akers

38:20.580 --> 38:22.900
He's going once going twice

38:24.100 --> 38:27.140
Thanks for the call. So, uh, basically I

38:27.140 --> 38:30.900
I believe I truly believe that Apple is uh, is

38:31.460 --> 38:35.940
Is sucking it up on I think they're sucking on the desktop and on the laptop

38:36.260 --> 38:41.220
And I think that's a good thing for their business model because I don't think that was where they're going to see

38:41.540 --> 38:47.380
Huge profits anyway, right? And I think that the cost to continue to develop macos to make it a competitive platform

38:48.100 --> 38:50.820
Was going to be high and I don't know that they would see the returns that they're getting

38:51.300 --> 38:53.300
So I think that's a good thing

38:53.300 --> 38:56.900
for them as a Linux desktop user. I have never been more excited because

38:57.940 --> 39:01.780
Windows despite the changes that they have made

39:02.580 --> 39:05.780
still suck and they will forever hold a

39:06.580 --> 39:13.780
A bad taste in everyone's mouth for being Windows. What do you what do you think though about the that new subsystem of theirs for Linux?

39:14.340 --> 39:17.140
And and the potential there for at least like a new version of Windows

39:17.140 --> 39:23.220
What do you what do you think though about the that new subsystem of theirs for Linux and and the potential there for at least

39:23.220 --> 39:28.180
Like the developer side or the content creator, right? Because they have the Adobe apps. Yeah, and there you can have both

39:28.500 --> 39:30.500
I I it did it does scare me a little bit

39:30.580 --> 39:31.460
um

39:31.460 --> 39:36.740
I think maybe what we're counting on in some ways is there is that distaste distaste of Windows and the want for a real

39:37.220 --> 39:41.940
You know POSIX style system, which you get with OS X at least a little and and obviously with Linux

39:43.380 --> 39:44.660
Huh?

39:44.660 --> 39:50.020
I I I I I guess I can see that I I can see that being a threat at the same time

39:50.100 --> 39:54.020
I think that eventually the people that like to dig down and get dirty with the system

39:54.580 --> 39:57.780
Are eventually going to want more so I think they'll come over to us eventually

39:58.180 --> 40:00.740
And I think they're also going to just be honest with you

40:00.740 --> 40:03.060
I think they're just going to get tired of their computer crashing all the time

40:04.180 --> 40:05.940
I like it. So uh

40:05.940 --> 40:09.220
So this brings a lot of hope to me because I think that you're going to have people

40:09.620 --> 40:11.860
I don't think Windows is a great place to be on the desktop

40:11.860 --> 40:15.780
I think macOS is becoming a less great place to be on the desktop. And so

40:17.040 --> 40:21.300
Microsoft continues to focus on and in transition to cloud-based services

40:22.260 --> 40:28.180
Exactly and Apple is transitioning and focusing on mobile. So who's left to really concentrate on the traditional desktop?

40:28.740 --> 40:29.860
Linux now

40:29.860 --> 40:33.860
If if if the answer to that is while the majority of people are just going to have an iPhone

40:33.940 --> 40:36.580
They won't have a computer. I can totally live with that

40:36.580 --> 40:42.680
if my job revolves around supporting Linux desktops for people that work in in CEO positions

40:42.980 --> 40:48.020
Or tech level positions or something like that and in the traditional desktop keyboard mouse laptop

40:48.260 --> 40:52.020
If that paradigm is is relegated to Linux

40:52.020 --> 40:57.700
Even if the even if the amount of people in that paradigm shrinks and those people have and the majority of the society

40:57.860 --> 41:02.740
Has moved over to mobile devices. I can live with that compromise. I can happily live with that compromise

41:03.060 --> 41:05.620
I think I think there's some nuance there at least in terms of where

41:05.620 --> 41:10.100
We're expected to do things but along as long as things are currently shifted towards the

41:10.660 --> 41:14.820
Obviously you can do content creation in some domains on your mobile device

41:14.980 --> 41:18.660
but I think as long as it's like, you know, there's professionals in the back rooms creating things and then you know

41:18.660 --> 41:24.660
We have all these other devices we use for consuming and interacting with them. Sure. Yeah, that's where I could I could live with it that way, too

41:25.780 --> 41:30.580
so a couple of uh, so a couple of weeks ago we talked about the

41:31.300 --> 41:33.300
Super Nintendo on

41:33.300 --> 41:39.620
or the uh, the new Nintendo Entertainment System that is going to be running on Linux

41:40.180 --> 41:43.940
And apparently there is an exploit compromising Linux desktop

41:44.980 --> 41:49.460
Wes, can you tell me about this? Yeah, so it doesn't actually relate to that fun device. It's just kind of similar

41:49.940 --> 41:52.260
There's a lot going on with the NES these days

41:52.500 --> 41:55.700
So this is a zero day exploit right now, though

41:55.700 --> 42:00.340
At least the one that was released it really only affects like a specific version of Ubuntu 12.04

42:00.340 --> 42:04.260
So it's not something you necessarily need to have

42:04.340 --> 42:10.900
But basically there's a Gstreamer plugin that plays these NSF files, which are music files from the from the NES

42:11.380 --> 42:13.780
Um, and when you're using something like Nautilus

42:14.020 --> 42:14.500
Yeah

42:14.500 --> 42:16.740
It it tries to part like when you open it

42:17.300 --> 42:20.740
these files gets parsed by Gstreamer and there is a

42:21.460 --> 42:27.380
There's a vulnerability in in one of these it's in the bad set of plugins for Gstreamer and it only is in the 0.10

42:27.380 --> 42:30.920
Distribution not the newer 1.0 Gstreamer package

42:31.720 --> 42:33.720
But basically when that happens then

42:34.200 --> 42:40.520
Then you get pwned, but it's kind of interesting because these files they're not like a regular music file, you know broken down into samples

42:40.680 --> 42:40.920
Yeah

42:40.920 --> 42:46.680
It actually emulates a processor like it takes less space and the way they're encoded it emulates a processor to then

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Tell and then it tells the processor

42:49.000 --> 42:53.480
Do these instructions to produce these tones and then it captures those tones and plays them which I thought was kind of interesting

42:53.560 --> 42:54.600
It is interesting

42:54.600 --> 42:58.840
So not to not to totally so first, I guess I'll open it up to the moment room. What do you guys think of this?

43:00.680 --> 43:02.680
You guys are so quiet today

43:02.760 --> 43:09.400
You guys come in the the technology of the the emulating the the processing of it to create the sound is it's kind of amazing

43:09.480 --> 43:14.440
because it more like one of the biggest problems with most emulators is like they're trying to

43:15.320 --> 43:17.400
reverse engineer it instead of trying to

43:18.840 --> 43:20.840
Try to create a hardware emulation

43:20.840 --> 43:27.960
Uh-huh, like one of the the biggest things is like a lot of games that are impossible to play as an emulator because the the hardware

43:29.320 --> 43:36.600
Emulation that they're trying to compensate is more like slowing down the current process the current hardware we have

43:37.160 --> 43:39.800
whereas this is more super interesting, but the

43:40.840 --> 43:45.240
the the the problem with the zero day doesn't really sound like it's a big problem, but it's

43:46.120 --> 43:49.880
You know, it's going to get a ton of attention, especially like ars technica and stuff, right?

43:49.880 --> 43:55.160
And it just to me it was more interesting really to highlight these files and the way they work and of course to be just

43:55.160 --> 43:59.960
To just to realize like, you know, um, obviously this just doesn't affect newer distributions

44:00.360 --> 44:02.600
But it's always good to be aware of parts of your systems that are

44:03.000 --> 44:07.240
Taking vulnerable inputs which are you know file system files and auto loading them or that kind of thing

44:07.240 --> 44:08.840
Just just something to think about

44:08.840 --> 44:10.840
Anyone else? I'm only using 12

44:10.920 --> 44:15.320
1204 should yeah gtfo great from what I saw it was

44:15.320 --> 44:20.380
Is recommended to use a raspberry pi and put retro pi. I mean, how does that compare?

44:21.740 --> 44:23.740
I mean, this is not really right. It's

44:23.980 --> 44:30.300
This is a difference between being an official product versus um, you know creating yourself. It's like you you technically aren't

44:30.940 --> 44:34.060
Legally allowed to download roms unless you own the game itself

44:34.620 --> 44:36.620
so um

44:36.700 --> 44:39.100
They're not losing any money from it. So they're not gonna like

44:39.820 --> 44:43.180
technically attack anyone for those doing those things but

44:43.180 --> 44:47.980
This is more like if you want to have like a set top box kind of thing that's built for you

44:47.980 --> 44:52.300
And you don't have to build it yourself, but there's also certain games that can't run

44:52.860 --> 44:54.860
without proper emulation

44:54.860 --> 45:00.060
So like if you're getting retro pi that retro pi is just like a distro that pulls all these different emulators in

45:00.700 --> 45:03.500
So you're not really going to get the exact kind of experience

45:03.740 --> 45:09.580
So maybe some games like for example, this is not what nes classic does because it's just the nes

45:09.580 --> 45:17.180
but if they ever come out with like n64 classic or something like that, that would be amazing because games like banjo kazooie were

45:17.820 --> 45:19.100
taking

45:19.100 --> 45:22.940
Flaws that were in the hardware of the n64 and making that a feature of the game

45:23.420 --> 45:27.820
So they're impossible to emulate. So if they figure out a way to emulate the the

45:28.600 --> 45:31.420
Processor for the n64 that would be amazing

45:32.380 --> 45:38.640
I mean i've been waiting on that a long time as well. Uh, super nintendo, I think would be more exciting to me or n64

45:38.640 --> 45:41.120
I I i'm really hoping for the n64

45:41.200 --> 45:44.400
In fact when uh, I was I was joking with rikai a couple of weeks ago

45:44.400 --> 45:51.120
I said when we talked about that little portable nes system. I said I wish nintendo would make a portable n64 system

45:51.200 --> 45:55.040
Right, I would take that everywhere. I would if I had a portable game boy like device that I could play

45:55.680 --> 46:01.280
golden ion that would be ideal, right and what uh rikai's answer was

46:02.400 --> 46:05.680
He said you have one. It's called your s6 and I said

46:05.680 --> 46:09.360
They they have that and he goes. Yeah, so sure enough went to the google play store

46:10.160 --> 46:15.840
And uh, and I was able to download an emulator on my phone and you know, the great thing about

46:16.240 --> 46:18.240
My phone is it's on ting, right?

46:18.560 --> 46:25.520
And so I have I don't pay to download any of the any use any of my data because i'm on wi-fi

46:25.600 --> 46:32.000
In fact, we have a special wi-fi network that is at every location that we work at and it we call it the tech network

46:32.000 --> 46:36.320
The tech network and it's oh that's clever. I like it. Yes. It's there's no speed restriction anything like that

46:36.400 --> 46:41.280
So basically any client I go to I have internet. I have network coverage

46:42.060 --> 46:48.880
Unrestricted unrestricted network coverage and so I can walk into to any of these places and and just my phone automatically connects

46:48.880 --> 46:53.120
So basically what I need my mobile carrier to do is to provide me with

46:53.840 --> 47:01.120
Basically gap coverage, right? So right when you're on your way between sites exactly. So I had a nine and a half hard drive between

47:01.120 --> 47:04.000
uh, wisconsin and grand forks and then

47:04.560 --> 47:09.040
Today, uh, well over the past two days. I actually I had to

47:09.600 --> 47:14.240
I was in an airport for well what ended up being like 17 hours 18 hours, right?

47:14.560 --> 47:16.560
And the great thing was I don't usually

47:17.680 --> 47:22.400
Tether on my on my laptop. Usually I just have a dedicated little card that that connects there

47:23.120 --> 47:26.240
Card wasn't connecting and so I was like i'll just tell it right now

47:26.240 --> 47:28.320
This is something I haven't used in a long time on my phone

47:28.320 --> 47:30.880
My phone had a great signal laptop didn't I take my phone?

47:31.120 --> 47:35.680
Climb up the airport and set it on like the edge of the window. Nice. Yeah enable hotspot

47:36.240 --> 47:39.440
Ting doesn't charge me any extra for the hotspot. It's just pay for what you use

47:39.680 --> 47:41.760
So you use 100 minutes you fall into that bucket

47:41.760 --> 47:45.920
They charge you for 100 minutes you use one gig of data you use one gig of data and they don't care if you're using

47:45.920 --> 47:53.440
That giga data on your phone or if you're using that giga data through tethering on your laptop cell phone plans for adults

47:53.440 --> 47:59.200
Exactly. Yeah cell phone plans for adults. Now. There was a gentleman in the chat room that asked me if I would send him

47:59.280 --> 48:03.200
A ting sim. So if you send an email to know at jupiter broadcasting.com with your address

48:03.520 --> 48:07.840
I will throw a ting sim in there and get that out to you. No problem ting sims as a service

48:07.920 --> 48:10.400
I am. Yeah, I am. This is not an offer for everyone

48:10.400 --> 48:14.880
I said one person that like reached out to me and specifically asked i'm going to accommodate him

48:15.040 --> 48:18.880
I am not going to send ting sims to everyone but that particular guy it's i'm feeling generous

48:18.880 --> 48:24.560
So, uh, you send me your address and I will ship you out of ting sim free of cost at my expense

48:25.360 --> 48:28.420
And if you want to get a ting sim, you can go to linux.ting.com

48:29.120 --> 48:32.560
It'll get you 25 off your first device your first month of service or

48:33.360 --> 48:35.360
You can get 25 sim cards

48:35.440 --> 48:38.240
You didn't think about that. Did you no I didn't no you didn't but if you wait for the dollar

48:38.320 --> 48:43.600
That's your whole business right there. Exactly exactly if you wait for the dollar sim sale

48:44.240 --> 48:46.240
You could get 25 sims

48:46.640 --> 48:48.160
for free

48:48.160 --> 48:50.160
with your first month of service

48:50.160 --> 48:54.000
I don't know if that's really a necessary or good thing to do but you could totally do it

48:54.240 --> 48:58.320
The other thing you could do is you could get uh, 25 off your first phone which for me

48:59.600 --> 49:04.480
Paid for the majority of the phone because I buy cheap phones exactly or you could get 25 off your first month of service now

49:04.880 --> 49:10.080
Between my wife my son my mother and I I think our average ting bill is like

49:10.800 --> 49:14.880
Oh, and I have a couple office phones and I think our average ting bill is 45 bucks

49:14.880 --> 49:19.920
That's all right. Let me look i'll tell you what not only does ting have an amazing dashboard. They have an amazing app

49:19.920 --> 49:24.320
We don't talk about the app nearly enough, but I can pull this app up in about 30 seconds 27

49:25.280 --> 49:29.920
Wes, will you verify please? Yep, 27. All in the nose now. Look at how many minutes i've used

49:30.800 --> 49:34.880
Zero zero minutes. You know why because all of my calls are funneled over sip

49:35.200 --> 49:39.280
So I use a I use a program data and then and then you're just you have the one bucket system to worry about

49:39.440 --> 49:43.520
Exactly not only do I have the one bucket system to worry about that particular bucket doesn't apply to me

49:43.520 --> 49:49.680
Basically anytime i'm not in in transit, right when I got here as soon as I got here stop not using minutes anymore

49:50.320 --> 49:54.480
So linux.ting.com get yourself something nice and thank you

49:55.200 --> 49:58.720
To ting for sponsoring the linux unplugged program

50:00.720 --> 50:04.720
All right guys, so let's take a look I want to dive back into

50:07.120 --> 50:09.040
This uh

50:09.040 --> 50:15.600
Linux fest northwest founder honored with uh, the community builder west. Can you tell me a little bit about this?

50:16.560 --> 50:21.920
uh, yeah, so there's just uh, there's a an award called the cascadia community builder award and it's you know, it's meant to

50:22.320 --> 50:25.840
to recognize people in the the cascadia region the pacific northwest who

50:26.160 --> 50:31.120
Have done good work building community building things that people can feel a part of building organizations that last you know

50:31.520 --> 50:34.080
Over time that bring people to get diverse groups together

50:34.400 --> 50:38.480
and so this is kind of it's just a nice article over on open source.com talking about uh,

50:38.480 --> 50:45.120
Bill who has been the the main founder and person running linux fest northwest. Obviously the home show here of the jb network

50:45.280 --> 50:52.640
Yeah, um, so kind of tells the story back in 1968 the great northern railroad hired bill then a student at western washington university my alma mater

50:52.960 --> 50:54.960
Uh because of his computer experience

50:55.440 --> 51:00.160
Uh bill became interested in linux and open source community in the late 1990s as things were ramping up

51:00.640 --> 51:02.320
With another few other computer nerds

51:02.320 --> 51:08.640
He helped start the bellingham linux users group and then from then started its linux fest and since then he's been he's been doing it uh,

51:08.800 --> 51:14.560
You know, he's he's seen a lot at other festivals around the area. He's known in the community. He's recognized by people all around

51:14.640 --> 51:19.920
So this is just a great little thank you bill. Thank you for all you've done and some nice community recognition. That's super cool

51:20.480 --> 51:22.880
Momo room, how many of you guys are coming out to linux fest northwest?

51:24.160 --> 51:26.560
I'm, hoping to be there. Awesome. Anyone else?

51:26.560 --> 51:31.200
No idea if i'll make it all right. All right. Well, it's in april. So start thinking about it now

51:32.160 --> 51:33.680
early may

51:33.680 --> 51:38.640
Money money issues. Yeah, that's that's a real thing, right if we could come up with some way

51:40.160 --> 51:45.840
To have some sort of like sponsorship to get people to uh different linux fest. That'd be a be the real way to go

51:46.880 --> 51:51.840
Uh, you know, the other thing is too is I wish they would split these uh linux fest linux cons up a little bit

51:51.840 --> 51:56.480
Because it would be nice they all hit like in the first couple months. Yeah march to june

51:56.560 --> 52:01.440
You know scale the linux fest northwest itself. Yeah, it's just like immediately all in a row exactly

52:01.440 --> 52:05.040
Yeah, it just it just it just it drains the pocketbooks of those of us that have to uh,

52:05.600 --> 52:10.000
Have to be at all those it's unbelievable. I'll be at scale. I don't know about lfnw. All right

52:10.560 --> 52:14.240
Uh, so kde neon users are requested to perform a full

52:14.860 --> 52:17.760
Reinstall, uh west. What can you tell me about this?

52:17.760 --> 52:24.240
Uh west, what can you tell me about this? Uh, well, so it looks like it was just that some of their uh package distribution servers

52:24.560 --> 52:27.200
Uh, it was possible for people to push things to them, right?

52:27.200 --> 52:32.640
So here's a package archive used by katie neon was incorrectly configured so that anyone could upload packages to it

52:32.800 --> 52:35.760
They have no reason to think that anyone actually did so or that there was any, you know

52:35.840 --> 52:40.800
Intentional compromise or that any of these packages are bad, but they do ask that for your own protection

52:41.360 --> 52:44.320
They've they've updated packages. Everything has a newer version in the repo now

52:44.320 --> 52:48.100
So if you if you do a reinstall you'll get all the new packages and they fix that configuration

52:48.480 --> 52:51.520
And restore the server. So it's just something to be aware of if you're on neon

52:52.080 --> 52:54.080
That's crazy

52:54.080 --> 52:55.360
uh

52:55.360 --> 52:58.320
What else do we have mumble room? How are you guys doing? I haven't heard much from you

52:58.400 --> 53:03.440
This would be a great episode for you guys to to chat because my voice is just uh, it's not great

53:03.520 --> 53:06.640
Take it easy on poor newick. Well, I mean, I don't know you're chatting at all

53:06.720 --> 53:09.120
I just don't want to be rude when people are talking. Oh, no, no

53:09.120 --> 53:13.200
Um, we we're we're following your lead though. All right

53:13.920 --> 53:17.440
For so for the about the uh, the katie neon thing

53:18.000 --> 53:18.960
um

53:18.960 --> 53:20.960
There it's not necessary to

53:22.080 --> 53:24.080
To do a reinstall

53:24.400 --> 53:26.400
They're they're suggesting that

53:26.560 --> 53:28.560
If you're worried about it

53:28.560 --> 53:32.320
Like for extra security to be absolutely sure you could do a reinstall

53:32.880 --> 53:38.400
But they're saying that if you just do an upgrade once the packages are rebuilt that it's it should be fine

53:38.400 --> 53:40.400
Do they not sign their packages?

53:41.040 --> 53:43.440
they they do sign the packages but it's more like

53:44.160 --> 53:49.840
if someone had access like the configuration issue is that someone could just push the packages and

53:50.640 --> 53:52.640
They would be on the server

53:52.640 --> 53:54.000
kind of

53:54.000 --> 53:55.360
with like

53:55.360 --> 54:00.640
Already allowed to be in so they would be signed by this process kind of yeah

54:01.600 --> 54:03.840
So unfortunately that doesn't solve the problem

54:04.800 --> 54:05.840
but uh

54:05.840 --> 54:09.600
They wouldn't be able to like replace the other packages. They would be able to replace like add their own

54:09.840 --> 54:12.560
extra package they could kind of like so it wouldn't be like

54:13.920 --> 54:16.080
Like having to rehash anything or anything like that

54:16.080 --> 54:19.280
It's just more they could put something on the server and then they could kind of like

54:19.680 --> 54:23.680
Trick a mega mega meta package to pull something down. It's it's a really

54:24.720 --> 54:31.040
Uh, it's it's a really scary sounding issue that is not as bad as it is but could potentially be terrible

54:31.040 --> 54:34.240
So it's more like just let's be aware of it. Yeah

54:35.280 --> 54:39.280
It's more like let's get it and get in front of it. So it doesn't actually make any problems

54:39.600 --> 54:44.580
I'll tell you what else is terrible is the internet of things this article comes to us from hackerboards.com

54:45.200 --> 54:49.120
Despite growing security threats the internet of things hype shows no signs of abating

54:50.160 --> 54:54.000
Feeling the fomo companies are busily rearranging the robots for iot

54:55.120 --> 54:58.880
The transition to iot runs deeper and broader than ever before

54:58.880 --> 55:05.440
Iot runs deeper and broader than the mobile revolution everything gets swallowed into the iot including smartphones

55:06.000 --> 55:13.360
Which are often our windows on the iot world and sometimes our hubs and sets are and endpoints now I have

55:14.640 --> 55:17.200
Said once or twice on this show and on lass

55:17.840 --> 55:21.440
That I don't like the internet of things. I don't like the concept. I don't like the name

55:21.600 --> 55:23.680
I don't like the branding. I don't like anything about it

55:24.480 --> 55:27.840
and yet there the answer now is

55:27.840 --> 55:29.520
from what I understand

55:29.520 --> 55:31.520
looking at containers

55:31.520 --> 55:39.680
To solve a lot of the problems that we face in the iot world. So canonicals iot oriented snappy abuntu core

55:40.640 --> 55:46.960
Version of abuntu is built around a container like snap package management mechanism and offers app store support

55:47.520 --> 55:53.920
The snap technology was recently released on its own for linux distributions on november 3rd canonical released abuntu core 16

55:53.920 --> 56:01.360
Which improves the white label app store and and update service control some update serve update control services, excuse me

56:01.760 --> 56:05.440
So basically their idea is let's take this really crappy

56:06.160 --> 56:11.840
World that we live in and try to use containers to leverage updates and security patches

56:12.080 --> 56:15.120
and I think on one one on one side that sounds ridiculous because

56:15.440 --> 56:20.240
Obviously from the world of our you know in the you go from the iot world to the server world and containers are the new

56:20.240 --> 56:25.440
Thing that's kind of viewed skeptically from the security angle where vms are trusted or you know bare metal even

56:25.760 --> 56:28.480
Uh, but but I think here the the idea really is, you know

56:28.480 --> 56:33.120
You're using you know using a bunch of like this the snap stuff or you're using resin.io

56:33.200 --> 56:38.800
Which is like a platform trying to use docker containers on embedded devices. Yeah, um, I think really what you're getting

56:40.000 --> 56:44.880
Is better, you know a better understanding of what you of the build structure and a lot of these embedded devices, right?

56:44.880 --> 56:49.040
Like they're you know, they're using build root. They're they're forking from existing open source packages

56:49.040 --> 56:55.200
But they're maybe not upgrading things. They may not have great build pipelines or anything approaching that so I think this is just trying to take

56:55.600 --> 57:02.320
Some some modern development practice modern, you know understanding what your dependencies are understanding what you're built from in ways where you can then

57:02.720 --> 57:08.640
Improve on that rapidly, uh to to hopefully at least compartmentalize and then establish right because with a container system you need to then

57:09.440 --> 57:10.160
Rather, you know

57:10.160 --> 57:11.520
If you have a telnet system, you know

57:11.520 --> 57:15.840
You have telnet running because you have to export the port for the telnet and you have to configure the daemon

57:15.840 --> 57:22.560
Uh more so than if you're just taking a fork of open wrt and sticking it on your light bulb bow chicken. Wow. Wow, you nailed it

57:23.200 --> 57:25.280
Yeah, no, uh mama room. What do you guys think?

57:26.480 --> 57:30.800
I don't know how that fixes the problem. I mean most of the problem is people aren't doing their jobs in

57:31.280 --> 57:33.280
Setting the systems up securely

57:33.360 --> 57:38.480
right, so I think I think and not not that this is the answer but more like it's it's one place they're exploring I think the

57:39.200 --> 57:41.200
their their idea then is to is to

57:41.200 --> 57:46.320
And make that easier to do have better systems to produce those artifacts to produce, you know

57:46.640 --> 57:52.320
And things without having to do things from scratch where you might not have the incentive to actually update things or configure them securely

57:52.640 --> 57:57.680
But personally I still like the separate offline network of things. That's my favorite. Yeah. No, that's fair

57:57.760 --> 57:58.320
Yeah

57:58.320 --> 58:05.920
But you're just complicating the the design of the solution to make it simpler and more secure kind of oxymoron there, you know

58:05.920 --> 58:12.000
Well, I I mean, I I think I think basically what they're doing is they're trying to say if you're going to have something insecure

58:12.720 --> 58:17.680
First of all, let's try to make it so that the people that develop the iot stuff don't have to

58:18.080 --> 58:22.800
Think about the security per se that can be handled for them on a different level and be pushed out, right?

58:23.200 --> 58:25.200
And the second they're not thinking about it now

58:25.440 --> 58:28.480
I agree, but that but so I mean if my choice is between

58:29.280 --> 58:34.560
An insecure internet of things any more secure internet of things. I don't like internet of things either way

58:34.560 --> 58:39.360
But i'll take more secure internet of things every time right and it may be that you have less of a service area that you

58:39.360 --> 58:45.200
You know if you're if you're responsible for the entire os stack and securing it versus if you're grabbing a base, you know

58:45.280 --> 58:51.440
Almost container hypervisor type thing and then you're responsible just for your app and what it exposes. It may be a different incentive structure

58:52.560 --> 58:58.400
And also it's more even more specific that it's not just a containerization system like docker

58:58.960 --> 59:00.240
snaps are

59:00.240 --> 59:06.080
Are are secured in a more of a mount a mount point that is its own

59:06.720 --> 59:13.440
Separate thing that it's but it's also connected to other pieces so that you have benefits of basically both worlds

59:15.040 --> 59:17.040
Hurricane uh herndes

59:19.520 --> 59:21.440
Hey, how's it going on

59:21.440 --> 59:22.320
Correct me if i'm wrong

59:22.320 --> 59:27.760
But most of the iot in devices that have been insecure has been because people haven't followed

59:27.760 --> 59:32.640
Best practices right and we're talking at the base level of the operating system

59:32.800 --> 59:38.080
So I don't see how docker is going to stop people deploying these

59:38.640 --> 59:40.960
devices with operating systems that have

59:41.520 --> 59:47.120
Um, you know, I mean the same password on all the systems or I mean the same security certificate

59:47.120 --> 59:52.560
You know, I mean these guys are not following best practices and I think that's the biggest issue here. Yeah, absolutely

59:52.560 --> 59:58.160
It's it's it's because it's not docker and it's more it's the same thing of you want to upgrade your system

59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.240
You do snap upgrade you're done

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:03.360
Well, I think what he's saying is that if you if you take a company

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:07.680
That doesn't it's we have a human problem not a security problem, right?

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.160
We have companies that aren't taking security seriously

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:15.920
And if you think that technology can solve security concerns and you don't understand the technology and you don't understand the security concerns

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.320
That's the famous quote, right?

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:24.960
Right. It's the issue of them being lazy and not updating it sure, but that's the same thing with all software of any kind

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.840
Okay, fair enough mini mac

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.040
Yeah, I more and more see that

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.360
Internet of things has become a marketing

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:38.160
Argument for products. I don't see the reason that a coffee machine has to be on the internet

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:43.360
So the real need and use it to secondary and these are in fact the machines

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.120
They're in fact used for spamming other machines afterwards, right?

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.840
Right, and that happens a lot actually you find that

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:56.080
You find that you you you run into a lot of these machines that like I saw a meme

01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:02.480
A couple days ago and it was talking about you know things like the the the internet connected broom and stuff like that

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:06.480
When you get to I mean there becomes a point where it becomes ridiculous, right?

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:10.960
There are certain things that make sense to be connected to the internet, you know from my perspective

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:17.280
But even people like my grand my grandparents would have not understood internet connected light switches to them

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.680
That would have been ridiculous that you'd want to put your light switch on the internet

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.240
So I I have a hard time deciding where exactly to draw that line because what seems ridiculous to me

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:32.080
May may not seem really ridiculous to the next generation and what seems perfectly logical to me probably seems ridiculous to the previous generation

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.480
but I this idea that this idea that

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:42.560
This idea that everything is is going to just happen in the cloud for us and talk out to the internet

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.520
Is kind of ridiculous, you know, I think it was william that brought up

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:52.000
There is a you don't have to be on the internet to have a connected lifestyle

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:55.680
I have ip based cameras. They are connected

01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:01.360
Three through their own dedicated switch. They have their own dedicated dhcp server

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:07.120
Uh, and they are on an entirely separate wiring system than the rest of the house

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:13.280
They are technically networked. Yes, but there is absolutely no tie-in to my normal household

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:16.000
Network and certainly no tie-in to the internet

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:22.880
So the chances of those cameras getting hacked some even if they they could be the most insecure thing in the world

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:29.040
The chances of those getting hacked slim to none slim to none unless you're physically inside of my house

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:34.000
And you manage to plug into that switch. There's no wi-fi access. There's no outside internet access

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:39.680
In a weird way. I kind of wonder if we haven't jumped a little too far with containers too fast

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.600
I kind of wonder if we haven't rushed it a little bit

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.600
I remember when containers first came out

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:49.600
I barely had a chance to start trying them before I started to hear people rolling them out into production

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.640
And in fact, I myself have rolled a couple of them out in production

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:58.400
And the only reason I was comfortable doing that is because we have services like digital ocean that

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:03.680
You that I can go ahead and try those things on before I actually have to go to a client's network

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:09.200
You know or someplace that where it really matters and you can set up a production ready

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.240
Emulation suite, you know, there was a time

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:16.480
When I was going through networking where I had to rent a cisco stack

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:21.200
So I rented, you know, you know a cisco switch and a cisco router and a cisco this and you know

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.200
It's very expensive. It's a couple hundred dollars

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:26.000
For the week to access that what they call the cisco lab, right?

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.360
and I I did when I was first setting up containers I did the same thing by going over to digital ocean and using the

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.160
uh the promo code do unplugged

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:39.440
And basically I was able to get a ten dollar credit and I was able to spin up

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:44.720
My first two droplets my first two five dollar droplets for free using their private networking

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:50.080
I was then able to build a virtual data center that I could test all of this stuff on

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.440
And I mean it was it was a total game changer

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:58.880
So come five six months down the road being able to walk into a client's

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.800
Facility and say yeah, I can do this with confidence. Yeah, we can go ahead and set this up

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.520
It was no problem for me because I had already tried it

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.840
I had already had a chance to play with this stuff

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:11.280
And if it didn't work out, I just blew it away and I started all over again

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:15.600
And i'll tell you the real key though, and no pun intended pun intended

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.480
The real key is when you pair this stuff with a ubi key

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:24.400
Because now you're not getting root passwords emailed to you and they're always like some obtusely long thing that you have to like copy

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:27.360
And paste and then you forget that you have to use shift when you paste into the terminal

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:31.680
So it doesn't really paste and then it closes something else. Oh my gosh, it's ridiculous

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.960
And then the other thing is too is I have this weird paranoid sense about me

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:40.240
I'm, like oh the nsa is spying on me that they've captured my yeah. Yeah, they've captured my email now

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.440
None of that with the ubi key

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:45.520
I literally add my ssh key and then when I spin up all my digital ocean droplets

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:51.120
I just checked that little box that says, you know, noah's ubi key around his neck or whatever and boom digital ocean spins up

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:55.680
Do makes it so easy to do that they do and if you use our code do unplugged again

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.120
You're gonna get ten dollars

01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.560
Which will give you the you can get a five dollar rig for free for the first two months

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:04.560
Or you can get two rigs or you could get a ten dollar rig if you wanted to try something

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:07.840
You know with a little bit more oof to it. We actually spun up

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.200
We were testing uh saccom one and saccom two

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.760
uh, we actually

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.360
We spun up like super super powerful ones just to kind of get the hang of it

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.400
Just to kind of see what it would be like to to work on a super powerful linux rig

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:23.920
I think we did it more out of novelty than any real production requirement

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.400
so linux, uh, uh

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.680
Digital ocean.com and use the promo code do

01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:34.000
Unplugged is crystal with us or did he he drop out?

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:40.080
He's still there. Yeah, you gotta did is your uh, is your connection any better, sir?

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:46.180
It's not his connection more like he's trying to set up push to talk and he's currently on voice activation

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.480
Got it. Okay. All right. Well, we'll let him sort that out. I uh, yeah

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.720
Kind of nice to have him here because uh, you guys are super quiet today

01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.160
Uh, so west tell me about the the end of the general purpose operating system

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.800
Uh, yeah, so this was just an article

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.320
I saw that I thought was kind of interesting uh over at the blog more than seven dot net

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:11.040
Uh, and it was just talking about kind of and it's probably is focusing maybe on the opposite end

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:18.000
Spectrum of the iot. I threw that article in there just to kind of get this this topic started. Um, but what we're seeing at the

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:21.760
I don't know when I when I started doing things on the internet, you know

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.440
Kind of in the early days of linux not super early, but the early days of like web scale linux

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:30.480
You know you were getting your vps or maybe a shared host and you were configuring things on the you had an ftp account

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:35.280
Or you had a you know, you had a whole open vz server that you were then configuring you had a whole

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:39.760
That you were then configuring you installed apache with mod php and you got your mysql going

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.520
Oh boy, now you got your web app running. Uh, but these days there's a lot of things

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:48.320
That's that's not necessarily the level of abstraction that people are going for these days

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.720
We're seeing a lot more, you know, you have infrastructure. It's a service

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:55.280
You have all kinds of different intermediate service platform service layers

01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:00.080
Uh, you have things like aws lambda where you know, you're not concerned at all or you know

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:04.320
The the whole no ops thing where you're not concerned about what operating system is. Is it rel?

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:10.000
Is it ubuntu it all runs on linux sure, but but for you, you know, you you write your java application

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.160
It gets executed in your container or wherever and then it runs. I want the candy

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.680
I don't care how I get the candy, right?

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:20.640
And I understand that I mean I even may support that that worldview when you're trying to build large scale distributed systems

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:24.080
I just wonder what it is that a success for linux. What does that mean?

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.520
Also, like what does that mean in terms of new developers who you know, maybe they start from the code side

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.120
But they want to start deploying things

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:35.440
I think in the past some of those people would then be pulled into the linux ecosystem

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:39.040
Where you're suddenly running linux at home and you're converting your media center and you know

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:44.240
You get in the linux culture and if you're just using these cloud scale platforms where yes linux is there

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:48.000
But that's not really never, you know, you make a docker container where you you know

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.840
You might your import python and then you build your python thing. Never is it even say the word ubuntu?

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:58.240
Or linux on it. What does that mean for the linux ecosystem and new developers new people in that ecosystem who are coming to this?

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:02.000
Well, let's tie that back to our original discussion about free nas and bst, right?

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:08.720
right, I think if you start to look at things in it from the from the from the perspective of I just want to

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.200
Put yeah, I want to push the button take the banana

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.600
If you know if we look at things in that sense

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:18.400
I like free nas because I can drop an enterprise ready solution if linux becomes

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:23.600
So effective at doing its job that I don't have to know it exists for me to get the banana

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:30.480
I'm okay with that. That actually doesn't bother me and if amazon can make a buck by customizing that operating system

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:36.160
And delivering delivering an end of banana to a to a user without them having to understand

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:41.920
How how the banana got there to begin with I guess i'm okay with that too. And so then to to to go on from there

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:47.920
How do you feel about the uh, how do you want to call it patriotism or you know to the to the kernel level?

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:49.680
Do you care mostly about?

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:53.440
You know the experience is it posix like is it or is it a license issue?

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:58.560
Like could you could amazon then replace their ec2 service with free bsd hosts or even a luminous host?

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:03.120
And would that change things for you? Would you is there a community loss there? Does it matter?

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:09.840
Well, I think first of all, I don't I i'm usually not aware if they're going to change something like that out

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:13.680
Right, I wouldn't know is again. I'm it's it's a black box. I don't know how it's working

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.920
I like I don't see that happening for a couple of reasons. First of all

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.680
I think that a lot of these systems have gotten built up

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:28.560
On the backbone of linux and they have ridden that train up and you get a lot of people that are very very comfortable

01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:32.240
Uh administrating in in what they already know and i'll give you a great example of that

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:37.380
It's been 15 years since I first sat down and was required

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.040
To use a given server a server operating system, right when I first started out

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.480
They said you will use rel because that's what we use here and that's you know, whatever

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:50.320
And you know, I was formally trained on rel and whatnot and and I got and I and I got my start in rel

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:54.080
Partly because I sought out jobs in that in you know in that area

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:55.920
but

01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:01.280
I ever since then I have formal training on rel I have worked with rel i've worked with redhat the company extensively

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:04.400
So when I go to set up a server, it is second nature to me

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:09.520
I just naturally want to use rel and you see in the military a lot of the guys that that go in and

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.160
They become very proficient with with a given firearm

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:17.360
They own a very similar firearm when they get home because it's what they like to shoot because they're very comfortable with it

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.800
And I I think that we have gotten as an industry

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:25.120
so entrenched in the linux ecosystem in the linux system

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.160
I think it's going to be very difficult if not impossible to ever back our way back out

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:33.440
And and and and so if you're going to go to something like bsd

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:38.320
Bsd would not just have to equal linux in in a competitive advantage

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:42.480
It would have to far exceed it because you would have to have something so compelling

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:47.360
That it's worth people to fundamentally relearn the system that they know. What do you guys think in the mumbo room?

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:53.920
In general, I don't think the general use os is going to go away for a long time because I mean

01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:00.160
These cloud solutions are great and all but even the average user is going to have to be on the technological level

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:05.200
And understanding to be able to use these and have them work

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:11.040
And people who really want a general use os to do whatever they want with as a playground

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:18.560
I think most of us in here and most people who work in it and devs who like to tinker will probably always use one

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.440
rotten corpse, what do you think?

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:26.400
Going once we'll always use um

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:34.320
I'll always use a, you know, general operating system. I mean, yeah, totally. I'll add stuff like um

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:42.720
A cody box or something. Sure, you know, there's definitely there's definitely places where it makes sense, but it's not a fundamentally going to change

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:50.080
How I use majority of what I do like I guess and I think that applies to most people because they're they're even if you have

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:59.040
Uh, like even if people switch like earlier we were talking about how maybe the mass majority of people will switch to something like a phone or a tablet as their main system

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:03.120
That's a general operating system. Sure. So I don't really think that this really has much

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.480
You know ground to stand on sure

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.440
so I guess I just wonder from the new user perspective and

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:13.360
And and maybe maybe it's like the the difference like you were talking about like learning rel

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:18.000
And like even learning rel like even though it's an enterprise distribution. It's kind of locked away in its own little tower

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.520
You know, you're on the command line. You're using these gnu tools. It's it feels more part of the community versus like

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:28.320
These days maybe you could have come up and like what you got you got certified in aws, right?

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:31.760
You know how to administer the acls for network access as you know

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:35.600
All about ec2 sure and that doesn't I guess that doesn't feel the same in terms of

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:39.440
You're maybe even accomplishing the same things, but it doesn't have the same heart to me

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:40.880
You know, it doesn't and you know

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:44.880
The thing is it's we're in a drastically different landscape today than we were 15 years ago

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.120
You know these days when I started out

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:51.760
I spent I and I spent it out of my own money too. Uh, no, no actually I didn't that's not true

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:57.360
That's not true. I I got a company to pay for but I I I contacted a company and had them pay

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.440
I think it was like three grand

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:05.200
To send me to official training to get trained on on rel because I was doing this stuff for them

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.400
And I said, you know, I just I really need some some actual training and it wasn't so much that I needed

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.080
To learn how to do things. I think I knew how to do the tasks

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:18.160
I needed to do really what it gave me was the confidence to know I was doing things correctly

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:22.480
These days you don't have to spend twenty five hundred three thousand dollars to get that sort of training

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:25.620
You know, you don't you you can go to linuxacademy.com

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.640
Unplugged and we will give you a great deal

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:38.000
Uh to be able to use linux academy and the thing about linux academy is they take everything in bite-sized pieces

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.240
So they work with your schedule

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:44.960
They take everything that you'd need to know and and you can do it on anything

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.940
You can do it on rel you can do it on abuntu. You can do it on aws

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:53.760
You pick the area of expertise that you need to know and then you go through those snippets now for me personally

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.520
I went through when I when rel7 came out. I didn't need to go through

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.400
You know the basics of the red hat operating system

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:03.760
I'd been using it for 10 years, but I needed to know it was different between six and seven

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:10.480
Wow, linux academy had a course for me. They had a course from transitioning from six to seven and I was able to in just

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:14.240
A week or so get myself up to what I would have had to spend

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:19.280
Five days plus hotel plus food plus taking time off work. A lot of people don't

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.760
Constantly, you know if you're self-employed

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:26.880
The cost to come here to do a show the cost to fly out here the cost to stay here that

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.640
That's not where the money is

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:31.520
The money is in the fact that i'm not working when i'm back in grand forks

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:37.920
How much money could you have made exactly the cost in going to a training session is not the 2500 three thousand dollars

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.360
Really? That's peanuts

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:43.280
It's not the couple thousand dollars i'm going to spend on a hotel for a week or the food i'm going to spend

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:48.560
It's the time away from it's the time away from my business and and I see that dropping well with linux academy

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:53.360
I'm able to keep doing my work keep serving my clients and at the same time

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.040
Stay up to uh, stay up to date on the leading edge of technology

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.280
You can get a professional grade education right there in your office

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:03.920
You can and these people are dedicated linux professionals. They're not just people that show up, you know

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:09.280
You know just just to collect a paycheck. These people are dedicated linux professionals that that you know

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:15.600
Really have a passion for teaching linux. So head over to linux academy dot com slash unplugged and a huge. Thank you

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:20.000
To linux academy for sponsoring the linux unplug program

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:28.080
So one of my passions in fact it one of the focus of uh, the show that we are working on uh, the call-in show

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:35.360
Called ask noah that we're working on is uh going to be small business. Small business is near and dear to my heart

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:40.720
And one of the things that fits in tandem with small business is of course

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:44.240
Linux because in small business, it's all about that roi

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:50.400
How can I get the most return on my investment for the least amount of money invested? So this article comes to us from zdnet

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:57.520
Many small businesses with tight budgets are facing a tough choice stick with an obsolete operating system and remain vulnerable to hackers or spend a lot

01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.520
to install new gear

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:05.280
David gerwitz shows how linux can help preserve your investment while still staying safe and secure

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.560
Earlier this week my phone rang. I looked at the caller id and it was from a neighbor in the community since I was writing

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:13.040
I ignored it. Next week. I'm going to show you how to do it

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:18.720
I ignored it next came a text from the same guy. Please call me. Like I said, I was working so I ignored it

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.720
God, we've all been there, right?

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:24.560
Then came a succession of text alerts on my phone. I turned my phone off and finished my article

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:29.120
When I finally looked at my phone there were a scroll of alerts all from fred

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:33.840
I don't know fred all that well, but we often bump into each other around town and events

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.480
He normally seems like a cheerful calm sort but not today

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.160
I listened to his voicemail message where he sounded like he'd been crying

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:43.300
We're done. Dave. Don't know what to do expletive computers

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:49.440
It was a busy week and it sounded like it'd been generally desperate. I I reluctantly decided to get involved

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:53.200
I called him back and said hey fred what's going on? You sound upset dave. Can you come over?

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:58.880
I think I might be done for if there's if there's a chance fixing computers is not her. Sorry. This is back to him

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:03.840
Fixing computers is not my favorite thing, but i'd been inside all day and so it would be nice to get out

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:05.840
So I headed over to his office

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:10.560
What I walked into seemed like a war zone more than an office a cluster of workers

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:16.640
Were staring at a clunky old lcd monitor that looked like they'd seen a ghost. Here's what I discovered fred's service business

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:23.600
Has 20 pcs all more than a decade old and still running you got it windows xp. Where's abel?

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:29.600
This time it was ransomware this time. He wasn't going to recover quickly or cheaply

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:35.760
Fred was running windows xp for a few reasons his hardware was running solidly and he didn't want to pay for a windows upgrade

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:40.720
Remember that free windows upgrade to windows 10 didn't include xp, but he couldn't afford to buy new machines

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:43.440
Now here's the thing

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:46.320
I see this

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:50.400
This is this is not a this is not a an isolated incident

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.920
I see this on a daily basis this right here

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.560
And if you're wondering why I dove so far deep into this article

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:59.520
It's because I first of all, I think the writer just did a fantastic job

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.240
really drawing you into his narrative, but the second thing is

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:05.040
this story is

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:11.600
Probably 95 of our customers really rings true. They have reached the end of their rope. They don't have a

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:14.800
Necessarily large budget they have a budget

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.760
Yeah, you know, we're not america worker, right?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.080
But they have a budget just not a large budget and they don't want to spend, uh, you know

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:27.540
60 000. Well actually more than that. We we just did a bid for a business that is getting all new machines

01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:33.060
Uh whole nine yards and that's I think it was 85 grand and of course that includes all the network

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:38.420
Infrastructure and installation stuff like that and they're doing you know, so we're pulling new wire and stuff for them

01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:43.060
Yeah, but uh, but and that doesn't even include I mean i'm sure it would be more expensive

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:46.660
We are buying those computers with windows right because these are no operating system. We're gonna put linux on them

01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:51.300
This kind of client exists out there. So if you are a that there are two

01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:56.980
People that this story should speak volumes to the first story is if you want a small business and you're running computers with windows

01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:58.980
Xp you need to stop today

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:02.500
You need to go download up on to mate and you need to make it work for you

01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:05.940
The first thing you're going to say is well noah

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:11.060
There are some applications that I just have to run on windows xp or that i'm just very used to this

01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:14.980
Not saying it's going to be a perfect experience. You might have some hiccups along the way

01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:17.300
But I promise you a hundred percent

01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:23.460
You are going to have hiccups if you continue down this path of using a 15 year old operating system and expecting it to continue

01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:24.980
To work for you

01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:26.980
Microsoft isn't doing any favors in that regard, right?

01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:31.940
The second group of people that should really take light note of this story

01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:35.700
Is if you have it in you to start a local it service

01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:42.980
This is your client right here. You go find this person and you say for you know, $50 an hour $75 an hour

01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:46.580
You know $50 an hour $75 an hour $90 an hour whatever you think you can get

01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:49.780
I will come in here and I will clean all these machines up

01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:55.460
I will reinstall them with the latest version of an operating system for you and i'll work with you until we get your business operating

01:19:55.860 --> 01:20:00.260
With acceptable solutions if you are willing to do that and you're willing to stick with it, you know

01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:02.340
And I sat just last week

01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:06.580
sat in a boardroom across from a uh, you know a very demanding client

01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:11.700
And he looked right at me and when I told him we're gonna wipe these machines gonna wipe windows off

01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:15.940
I'm gonna put linux. We're gonna do this. We're gonna do that. You know, it was not I was not met with uh,

01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:19.460
You know, oh that sounds great, right? He wasn't very happy about it

01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:22.820
Um, but you just you stick on your guns and you say this is why we're doing it

01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:28.740
And I have a I have a proven track record in the last 10 years of doing this and we have successfully served clients

01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:31.300
We can successfully serve you but you need to trust us on this

01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:35.140
You need to let us go forward. You need to let us do this and this is why and here are the competitive advantages

01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:39.140
You will make so much money off of doing stuff like this. It's not even funny

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:41.140
I'm a room. What do you guys think about this?

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:49.940
I definitely think that's a good service to have and people should be jumping up on that because they really do need to move

01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:51.780
away from xp

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:55.060
It seems to be like a a good value add that the community, you know

01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:58.820
Like where maybe open source plays well where a commercial solution wants to wrap it all up

01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:03.780
They want to sell you the support but where open source solutions open up is a good business opportunity for people who like open

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:08.420
Source who contribute who support it who can then go out in the agency and one evangelize and then two

01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:12.340
Maybe provide support sell support that can then you know foster the community

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:17.220
What do you guys think it'd be it'd be a great option for

01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:22.340
If there was like a community project that would do a service but provide like you still had to pay for it

01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:24.420
but you're paying for support and

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:30.100
The people who are committing to the project are getting paid from that in certain ways. So it's more like

01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:35.460
You're you're contributing to help the community help people come to the community

01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:38.020
And that would be awesome. Um

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:43.380
but there was actually there's people who are still using xp and

01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:46.820
continue to use xp regardless of having

01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:53.300
Dealing with stuff all day. Like there is one. This is just an anecdotal story

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:59.060
But there was someone I was talking to a company that was potentially becoming was going to become a client for mine

01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:05.220
But they decided that um, they didn't they didn't realize they didn't think that they were a big risk

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:07.300
So they're going to keep using xp

01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:08.500
um

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:14.260
And I refuse to let them keep using xp as everywhere because they wanted to do it where every

01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:19.700
Every system was xp and their server was xp and everything absolutely. Everything's xp

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:23.460
I wanted to get like give them uh, linux everywhere

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:28.020
But an xp vm for the people who are going to use it so I could keep them off the internet and

01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:30.580
Since the xp is not online. It's not a big deal

01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:33.140
Uh, but they refuse to do that

01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:40.100
So I have uh one person who works there who sends me messages at least three times a week or so

01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:45.700
Uh complaining about something going wrong where their their computer completely crashes or

01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:50.820
You know the server getting infected even though supposedly that's impossible as they say

01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:52.820
but

01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:54.820
if we could actually provide them a

01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:59.940
community or a service or something that would give them, you know a semblance of

01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:02.740
support and they

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:06.900
Weren't they're not going into like oh, we're switching completely and it's up to us to figure it out

01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:12.260
Right. How many business owners would spend hours on google trying to figure that out when they really just need to get it done?

01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:15.540
And if they have a resource that they can maybe support financially or you know

01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:18.900
Whatever you need to do to make that work where it feels like, you know, they're doing it as part of community

01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:22.900
Maybe it helps put uh, you know businesses together against the virus

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:28.660
Uh, you know businesses together who have done that so that they have people to talk to talk about how the transitions went

01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:30.900
Problems with training all that stuff

01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:33.780
That's a good idea

01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:35.780
More as a part of a

01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:37.780
Good good. No good

01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:42.340
I was a part of a local it business, uh that that totally missed this vote

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:45.140
Um, I had been railing on them to begin supporting

01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:47.300
linux in any form

01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:53.860
Um from day one that I arrived there and I spoke to several clients about you know, oper oper

01:23:54.420 --> 01:24:00.260
Switching their operations over to linux and and finding solutions that worked and this was five six years ago

01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:01.380
um

01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:06.420
and now the local it business is dead and those clients are

01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:10.500
Looking around I guess they they have nothing to fall back on

01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:15.620
Uh, because this was this was a business that developed when doing hardware repairs was easy money

01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:19.860
And you could actually make you know a fair living at just repairing the boxes

01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:23.540
And I could not get this business to look bigger to look smarter

01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:29.460
at what was going to happen in the next five years with the hardware becoming essentially unrepairable because

01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:34.580
Joe consumer was buying tablet related machines more so than laptop or desktop related machines

01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:41.620
And they weren't looking at the commercial market. So there's my sob story of of an it business that totally missed the boat

01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:45.800
uh, yeah, just give me a second here. I got the link for you

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:48.840
It is a company called three

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:53.560
Sorry, there's a company that is inside of toronto where i'm located called free geek toronto

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:56.520
What they do is they take old machines and they convert them over

01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:00.920
Get them back up and running and they always throw linux on it. Sometimes they give them out for free

01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:02.920
Sometimes you can buy them. Here's the link here

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:09.560
Now the reason why i'm bringing them up is because there's a lot of people that are

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:15.640
out there right now that are in the hey, we're just going to remake this machine business now if more of them actually provided

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:23.080
Setups with linux on it, which would mean that they wouldn't be paying as much towards the um, the operating system

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:26.440
They could always you know, donate that to the people that are making the operating system

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:31.800
You know more people would be actually willing to try it out because a lot of people

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:36.600
Who are you know making the decisions about the computers at the work place?

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:41.560
You know making the decisions about the computers at the workplace. They're going to have windows at home

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:43.320
Or they're gonna have mac at home

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:48.520
So if they start off with linux at home say linux and windows like what I have all of a sudden

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:54.360
You're no longer as afraid to sit there and try out linux at the workplace because you already know

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:58.280
Hey, this is what it can do. This is what I can't do so on and so forth

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:01.400
And i've actually converted businesses doing exactly that rotten corpse

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:06.700
I like the idea of providing machines to people so that they have the transition

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.240
From work to home

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:11.800
And I also like the idea of giving them

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:17.080
Uh, you know a service that provides them with the free equipment to make it easier for that transition

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:24.200
But I don't like the idea of these free equipment. There's been there's multiple plate companies that do this

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.040
I know of one

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:29.080
One that mosenrath mentioned in toronto. I know of one in the uk

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.080
And they all do the same thing

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:37.560
They take these really terrible hardware that well linux can run on this old hardware. Yes, it can

01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:40.040
But that doesn't mean it's going to be a good experience

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:45.240
Right, it's probably going to be an awful experience because it's awful hardware linux deserves good hardware

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:49.560
You'll get even more value. Exactly that like when when they use something that's good

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:53.240
That's fantastic when they use them. They're giving something that's terrible

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:56.920
They're just going to blame linux and not the hardware because they have no idea

01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:02.280
Exactly. Well, thank you so much for the mumble room for joining us today. We really appreciate it as always

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:08.120
Special thanks to michael tonel our producer and show screener mit free the man who keeps our mumble room up and running

Linux unplugged airs live on tuesdays 2 p.m. Pacific time

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:21.420
You can keep an eye on the schedule of this show and every other show at jupiter broadcasting.com

01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:27.120
We look forward to seeing you right back here next week

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:53.500
So

01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:12.220
So, uh

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:16.640
There's an article here from mod zero on modzero.github.io

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:19.040
Github.io

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:26.240
And it is with the release of microsoft windows 10 operating system several innovations have been introduced into the market regarding privacy settings

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.080
What is normal?

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:34.880
What is a normality with apple since long apparently has been accepted by osx user now has finally become a reality for microsoft users

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:39.520
The analysis of the user data and behavior of the us american creator of software

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:46.160
Over time more users published instructions on how to break microsoft's habits of spying on the users including

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:50.640
Private users whose computers are not part of a company or enterprise domain

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.360
I was annoyed that this

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.240
That this leads to manually clicking check marks on a graphical user interface

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:03.040
Or running confusing powershell scripts that merge with several several single rule sets

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:06.640
So I don't know if you guys have seen this article or not

01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:09.600
Um, but it it basically

01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:14.960
Uh it my understanding is that there is a it is a it is basically a how-to guide

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:19.440
On how to fix windows 10 to be more privacy respecting. Is that right?

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:23.280
Well, even better than that. It's uh, like uh something you can install that will do it for you

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:30.880
Took a bunch of other guides tips on how to do it best practices that have emerged and then made a tool that will just

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:31.840
Apply that for you, you know

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:35.200
So if you don't really want to get into powershell scripts or find the registry or who knows what?

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:39.200
Uh, here's something that will purportedly do it for you. I haven't tested this myself. I don't have

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:42.560
Windows 10 at home, but I know a lot of people do, you know

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:46.880
Maybe you have it for gaming or something else or your spouse is using it and this might be something just to

01:29:46.880 --> 01:30:05.040
Help make it more like you're used to. Oh, that's awesome
