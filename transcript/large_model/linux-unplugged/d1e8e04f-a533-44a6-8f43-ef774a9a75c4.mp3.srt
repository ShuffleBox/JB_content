1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
You know, Wes, we've got this wonderful Apollo laptop here.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,120
This here, I got it from Entraware as an extended test here.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,280
They sent it over and I've been using it now as the main show.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,020
And it's such a nice looking laptop

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,920
that I don't really want to put stickers on it

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,880
because it feels like this laptop's gonna outlive

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,080
any one particular sticker.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,920
Totally.

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,120
So then I thought, well, you know what I'll do

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,600
is I'll get those vinyl sticker mats

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,440
for the whole back of the screen.

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,600
It does have a nice, beautifully clean back.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,800
Yeah, and so you just get one roughly the shape

14
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,720
of like a MacBook Pro or MacBook 13, whatever they're called.

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,480
And I'll put the stickers on that.

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,440
So I got a couple of different ones

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,880
and you know, they take a little time to be made.

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,900
So they're still getting delivered.

19
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,120
The first one I got, I just wanted, you know,

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,440
a canvas to put like cool stickers from Fests on

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,480
because when you go to these Fests, you just get-

22
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,320
Stickers abound.

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,880
Yeah, so the first one I got is just a real nice,

24
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,760
it's kind of hard to see, it looks a little blue

25
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,020
because there's blue lighting in the studio,

26
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,640
but it's just a wood grain vinyl sticker.

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,560
You see that there, Wes?

28
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,400
Very tasteful.

29
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
Just a nice wood grain.

30
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,560
Oh yeah.

31
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,520
And I'll just, I thought because it's brown,

32
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,360
white stickers would really pop on this.

33
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,200
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

34
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,000
So this is gonna be one that I could take on and off

35
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,120
and these can be applied and removed and then reapplied.

36
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,080
And then the other one I got,

37
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,080
because I thought it would maybe match my outfit

38
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,760
very often on the Linux Action Show,

39
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,920
is a red plaid sticker.

40
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,760
You see that? Yeah.

41
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,960
I got a red plaid for the back of the Apollo.

42
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,520
So I can be wearing red plaid

43
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,320
and the Apollo can be a red plaid

44
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,280
and it can be double red plaid and last now.

45
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,120
This is amazing, Chris.

46
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,640
Yeah, I'm really happy about this one too.

47
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,240
So that'll be going on the back of the Apollo.

48
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,400
That'll be the first one I'm rocking.

49
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,360
I'm really excited for a red plaid.

50
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,720
Yes, thank you, thank you, thank you.

51
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,720
This is Linux Unplugged episode 136 for March 15th, 2016.

52
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:56,720
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's getting in Lady Jupiter and going to pick up the ham radio. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. That's my plan at least, we'll see.

53
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:05,720
The weekend before Linux Fest Northwest, I'm going to see if Noah wants to take a road trip in Lady Jupiter and go pick up ham radio to help assemble the Linux Fest crew.

54
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720
Guess what, Wes? Big show today.

55
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
Yeah, huge show.

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,720
Big show.

57
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,720
You know, there's a few things we need to talk about.

58
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,720
Some new Linux hardware that people are really excited about and we're going to talk about some of the interesting things around that.

59
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,720
Mozilla's got something new that I'm really looking forward to, excited to share that.

60
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,720
Later on in the show, we'll talk about our Snappy future

61
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,720
and if these Snap packages, Snappy packages are really, you know, they are coming, are they really advantageous?

62
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:37,720
There actually seems to be a pretty good solid pro and cons list and there's one potential thing that sort of reeks of issues of the past.

63
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,720
We'll discuss that and a few of the security issues around Snappy packages. See what people think. See what they think, Wes.

64
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
Absolutely.

65
00:02:43,720 --> 00:03:01,720
And then, I've been tracking a particular drama since about 2013, gnome client-side decorations, love them or hate them. Starting in Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu Mate will have, or Mate, will have support for client-side decorations, pop over menus, shadows around borders.

66
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
So much fanciness.

67
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,720
Yeah, Wimpy spent some time getting everything up to snuff and we're going to talk about client-side decorations a little more.

68
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:16,720
Not going to spend a lot of time on it, but we're just going to talk a little bit about why a traditional-style desktop like Ubuntu Mate might be doing something like this.

69
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,720
So we got all of that, plus we got the updates to do before we get into the show.

70
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,720
It's just too much stuff, Wes. It's too much stuff.

71
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
Let's get started.

72
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,720
Let's get started by bringing in that mumble room. Type of probably a Green's mumble room.

73
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Hello.

74
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
Hello.

75
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Good evening.

76
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
Hello, everybody.

77
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,720
So, guys, Wes brought something real special into the studio today.

78
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:43,720
As hosts of your virtual Lug, we like to have a couple of brewskis because, really, I don't know if you've ever been to a meetup or a Lug.

79
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
I have.

80
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,720
But the best ones that I've been to were at a restaurant where they were serving beer.

81
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,720
Usually they're at schools or libraries.

82
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
Something a little more tame.

83
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
Yeah.

84
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,720
You can't really let your Linux flag fly.

85
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
No, that's right. That's right.

86
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,720
That's what I like about Linux Unplugged's virtual Lug is you get to bring your own booze and we like to just have a beer.

87
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,720
We're not going crazy. We're not getting stupid.

88
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
We have a show to do.

89
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,720
Actually, I mean, we do sometimes get stupid, but that's not related to the beer.

90
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,720
No.

91
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,720
So, Wes brought two couple of unique beers in, both from the same brewery but different types.

92
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Mine is the Ribstop Rye Pills from Basecamp Brewery out of Portland, Oregon, Wes.

93
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,720
They even put their GPS coordinates on the metal can.

94
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
Easy to find.

95
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Yeah, so there you go.

96
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,720
And then Wes is drinking the Intense IPL.

97
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Intense, like a tent.

98
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Whoa.

99
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
Hey.

100
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Fun city over here.

101
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
From Basecamp.

102
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,720
I got a score of 85 on your brewskis and I got a BA of 85 on mine.

103
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,720
So, both rated very good from the beer advocate community.

104
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
And these bottles are beautiful.

105
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
Very beautiful and I'm really enjoying this beer.

106
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
Yeah, right?

107
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Yeah, it's really a good beer.

108
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,720
So, anyways, Basecamp out of Portland, Oregon, great beer to go with your Linux.

109
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Wes, you know I spotted this story a couple of days ago and I dropped it in our thread and I said we got to talk about this thing.

110
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Here it is right here.

111
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
I got this here.

112
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,720
This is the – this one here is the Raspberry Pi 2.

113
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Could you tell by looking at it?

114
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
Can you tell?

115
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:02,720
No.

116
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,720
There's a couple of ways you can tell.

117
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,720
If you look at the Raspberry Pi, there's a little –

118
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
A field guide to the Raspberry Pi.

119
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
This is your quick guide right here.

120
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:20,720
If you want to know if it's a Raspberry 1, 2, or 3, you know it's a Raspberry Pi 3 on the – if there's a little Wi-Fi, a little white Wi-Fi antenna right there and then nothing on the corresponding side.

121
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
That's one quick way.

122
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Also, this HDMI port has this little color thing on there that's not there on the number one.

123
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:35,720
Anyway, so the Raspberry Pi 3, pretty nice device, but the first thing I thought when I saw this thing was, geez, I really now want the ability to boot from USB storage.

124
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Yeah.

125
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
I'm sick of the SD card thing.

126
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,720
I want just a big disk.

127
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Turns out that was actually a feature they enabled in the Raspberry Pi 3.

128
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
Really?

129
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
And Western Digital didn't take any time.

130
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,720
They're capitalizing on this.

131
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,720
They got a $46, 314-gigabyte hard drive built just for the Raspberry Pi.

132
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
The Pi drive.

133
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
It's based on a Western Digital Blue.

134
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,720
And one of the things that's kind of unique about it is its interface.

135
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
It's got a little – see the little USB interface there?

136
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,720
It's a slim profile drive.

137
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
Oh, that's cute.

138
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
Yeah.

139
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,720
They say it would normally cost about $45 a gigabyte – no, I'm sorry, $45 for the drive.

140
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,720
They're selling it right now at $34.42.

141
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,720
Seven-millimeter high drive.

142
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,720
It's just based on the regular blue drives that you'd see in a laptop.

143
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,720
They're going to also include with a Berry bootloader to make it easier to run multiple

144
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,720
OSes from the same drive hooked up to your Pi.

145
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
Huh.

146
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
That's funny.

147
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
Yeah.

148
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
And I was watching –

149
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
I could see that getting included in some of those kits, though.

150
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Mm-hmm.

151
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Mm-hmm.

152
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
For sure.

153
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
I was watching in my Google Plus feed.

154
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
A lot of people are ordering this.

155
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Yeah.

156
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
So people are excited about this.

157
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Bummer.

158
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Anybody seen this?

159
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
Would you add a hard drive to your Raspberry Pi?

160
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
You know, $46.

161
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,720
You get 314 gigabytes.

162
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:54,720
I definitely would if I had one just to be able to do what I want to do with it.

163
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
Is that a media center?

164
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,720
Because that was one of my first thoughts was – yeah.

165
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Yeah.

166
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Media center, pretty much.

167
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:06,680
You know, just have something small or maybe I want to do media center and IRC local server.

168
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,480
You know, I could do two things with it easily.

169
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,680
That's also enough for like if you kept this as your on-the-go media server, you could

170
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,080
sync down from Plex or whatever.

171
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
That's what I was just going to say.

172
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,400
That's enough for a pretty reasonable moving library.

173
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,200
I've been coming up with – I've been trying to come up with a solution for an offline

174
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,360
storage for my library that makes it easy to work with and being able to hang something

175
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,960
off a Raspberry Pi moves that Raspberry Pi up a notch in my list.

176
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
Pretty cool.

177
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,160
And the price, $46 for your 314 gigabytes.

178
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,400
My first hard drive was 20 megabytes.

179
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
So –

180
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Yeah.

181
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Is that still in production?

182
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Is that –

183
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
No.

184
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
No.

185
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
No.

186
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Wes, have you heard of Servo?

187
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Yes, I have.

188
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,400
I'm actually legitimately excited about Servo because we finally got ourselves – well,

189
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,560
a rough ship date of like June, was it?

190
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
I think.

191
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
June.

192
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,560
June.

193
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
Servo –

194
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
That's very specific.

195
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,560
June.

196
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
Which could be like the very end of June.

197
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
I don't even know if there's a – I mean, I assume they mean this June, but I don't

198
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
know if it's said.

199
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
Could be.

200
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
Hey, June.

201
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
Yeah.

202
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Could be.

203
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,000
It could be like June 2018.

204
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,760
Servo is a modern – a permanent – modern performant browser engine designed to be

205
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,440
super fast.

206
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Everything is of multi-process, but outside of that, it's built on Rust, which is interesting,

207
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,440
which I think is maybe the most interesting thing about it.

208
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,200
It's coming out of the Mozilla Research Division and they're building it for Linux

209
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,320
and – what's that?

210
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
The Mac and Android.

211
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
You know, it's funny.

212
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,960
They don't list Windows on here, but they do say Linux, 64-bit Linux.

213
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
64-bit Linux.

214
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
And Firefox OS.

215
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,400
What are you looking forward – well, yeah, sure, sure.

216
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,920
What are you looking forward to with Servo?

217
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,680
I think it's just neat to see like a project of this scale being built in Rust.

218
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,560
I've enjoyed following Rust's development.

219
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,260
I think it's a neat new systems language with a lot of interesting features.

220
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,260
So it'll be neat.

221
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,260
I don't know.

222
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:57,440
And Gecko is cool, but everyone is – it's WebKit these days or Blink or whatever.

223
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,560
So it's kind of interesting to see Mozilla pursuing something new and maybe if they can

224
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,000
bring some real improvements to that scene using Rust, that'd be awesome.

225
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,560
I would love.

226
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,320
I haven't tried it or anything, so I don't know.

227
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Go ahead, Rodden.

228
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,160
The cool thing about it is that Rust, the language, was actually developed because of

229
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
Servo.

230
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
Yeah, right.

231
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
I know, which shows you how long they've been working on it, too.

232
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,120
Hopefully that means they're getting it right.

233
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Yeah.

234
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
Hopefully.

235
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,480
The benchmarking with Red Renderer looks awesome, though.

236
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
This is the thing.

237
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,680
I mean, you guys know if I could switch my workflow over to Firefox, I would and this

238
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,280
could be a huge step towards making people excited again about writing some of the extensions

239
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,880
that I use on Chrome and some of that stuff.

240
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,500
I find just totally arbitrary example that is not really any kind of real-world test

241
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,520
other than it happens to affect me directly.

242
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,120
When I use that web app called IRC Cloud – have you ever seen this?

243
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
Yes, I have.

244
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,000
When I use it in Firefox, if I leave the studio on a computer and I leave it running and I

245
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,160
come back the next day, Firefox will be seized up, but not only just that, my entire desktop

246
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,860
session will be very, very, very laggy, very laggy.

247
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,460
Same thing happens on our GNOME web.

248
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,460
Same thing.

249
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,200
The same thing, which is a WebKit browser, does not happen under Chrome.

250
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,120
In fact, I can pin it to my browser in Chrome and accidentally forget to leave it there

251
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,120
for days and days and days and notice zero performance difference.

252
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,280
I know this is a silly benchmark, but for me, it tells me something about the way these

253
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:28,760
applications are architected, that the same exact web application in Chrome seems – yes,

254
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,400
Chrome uses more memory up front and all of that, but at the same time, it doesn't, after

255
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,840
a day, crash my machine.

256
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,960
Not a very common work scenario.

257
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,520
Not a big deal, but I think it makes a difference.

258
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,080
Is there a possibility there's also some sort of effect here with what we see in the Linux

259
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,680
world with firmwares, where things are tested for Windows but not Linux, are things these

260
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,840
days kind of just being written for Chrome in mind?

261
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
I don't know.

262
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Could be.

263
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Could be.

264
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
Could be.

265
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Could be, yeah.

266
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,240
So I'm looking forward to seeing them get people excited and fired up, and Servo –

267
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,720
I'm going to try to write something in Rust.

268
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
It seems fun.

269
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,760
Yeah, and Servo looks really cool.

270
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,600
So we like to follow – another project we like to follow is – this is sort of what

271
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,760
this portion of the start of the show has become on Unplugged, is open source projects

272
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,680
that we think are interesting that we follow and want to give you updates on.

273
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,360
Kitson, you want to jump in on Chrome and using more memory before we move on?

274
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
Go ahead.

275
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
Yeah.

276
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,420
I was thinking that might be why it is more performant is because it's keeping that

277
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:28,520
memory fresh in the background rather than perhaps pushing it on to hard disk or swap.

278
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
Right.

279
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Yeah.

280
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
That could very well much.

281
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,440
And also because even if one tab goes a little wonky, it very often does not affect the other

282
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,840
tabs on Chrome.

283
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
That could help, too.

284
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,320
So yeah, good point.

285
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
All right.

286
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,420
So we'd like to follow the Minecraft project.

287
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,360
The future of open source artificial intelligence, intelligence, intelligence.

288
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,240
We often hear from Ryan in their videos.

289
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,920
They have a new keynote style video, which doesn't work as well for me as some of their

290
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,360
other videos, but they do have something pretty cool to announce.

291
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,840
You heard of that X Prize there, Wes?

292
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Minecraft's going cray.

293
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Oh.

294
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,320
So we'd like to introduce founder and CEO of Mycroft, Joshua Montgomery, to tell you

295
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,200
about our new announcement.

296
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,240
Thank you, Ryan.

297
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
Hello, Joshua.

298
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,240
Hello.

299
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,880
I'm Joshua Montgomery, the founder and CEO of Mycroft AI.

300
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,380
Mycroft has partnered with Techstars, Vocality, Sprint, Ubuntu, and Lucid Labs in the pursuit

301
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,560
of an artificial intelligence platform for the connected home.

302
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:29,680
Today, I'm pleased to announce that Mycroft will be pursuing the IBM Watson AIX Prize.

303
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,160
The IBM Watson AIX Prize is a $5 million prize being awarded for significant accomplishments

304
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,960
in the field of artificial intelligence.

305
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,600
Should we win the prize, the $5 million will be donated to open source projects based on

306
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,480
the wishes of our developer community.

307
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,160
To win this prize, we've set a lofty goal.

308
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,760
It's our goal to create an artificial intelligence platform that interacts with people so naturally

309
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,520
that when you speak to it, you can't tell whether you're speaking to a machine or to

310
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
a person.

311
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
That's awesome.

312
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,640
For this effort, we're providing $250,000 in resources and assigning machine learning

313
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,960
expert Jonathan Dorlands to lead the effort.

314
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:14,080
Our first milestone on the road towards this goal is the open source speech-to-text engine

315
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,000
that takes speech and converts it into text both accurately and fast.

316
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We're looking for developers, students, and researchers interested in artificial intelligence

317
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,700
and in donating time and effort to the open source community.

318
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,760
If you're interested in working with AI and you have a passion for open source, please

319
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,960
visit us at openstt.org to find out more information.

320
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,680
Together we can win the IBM Watson AIX Prize.

321
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
That's interesting.

322
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
Thank you.

323
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,880
There is so much going on in AI right now.

324
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,600
It really is.

325
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,840
Microsoft today is talking about their AIX initiative, which they're going to be training

326
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,360
open... They're going to be some sort of... Oh, I got to look into it more.

327
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,520
I said I was going to, and I need to.

328
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,520
It looks very interesting.

329
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
And just in our backyard.

330
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,280
Of course, this week, Google's AlphaGo just...

331
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,280
Where can it go?

332
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,280
Right?

333
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,800
It just won a four-to-one match, I guess, so the human won once.

334
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,240
It's a really interesting week for artificial intelligence, and the MyCraft project basically

335
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,760
seems to have news almost every week.

336
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
It really does.

337
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,760
I'm thrilled with how well they're doing.

338
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,140
So far, I don't get a sense that they're failing to deliver.

339
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,720
It feels like they're on track, and they're doing well.

340
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,720
I'm a little taken aback, because not only is it rare these days, it seems like, for

341
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,660
a Kickstarter that I've been interested or backed actually to do well...

342
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,280
Where's the subtle disappointment?

343
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,880
Right, right.

344
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:50,400
But also, this is a really big deal for them not to F up for Linux and open source.

345
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,960
This is an area that's been so corporate control.

346
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,960
There's open elements to it, but all the big stuff is coming from...

347
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:04,440
It's an area that has been so driven by the marketing strategies of Amazon, and Google,

348
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,480
and Apple, and Microsoft with Cortana.

349
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,080
This has taken it so much further beyond that.

350
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,560
None of them are extensible in any way, really.

351
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,040
One point, I'm like, at what point is the MyCraft project going to crack?

352
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,320
At what point does a little upstart new project like this, that's doing something so ambitious,

353
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,920
reach their maximum capacity to handle all of these new partnerships and agreements?

354
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,280
Or when do they get bought and suddenly corrupted?

355
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,320
Well, they did just get into that accelerator, which should help, but yeah, it's just something

356
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,960
that I worry about, because they're so important.

357
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
Yes.

358
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,640
You don't really have a... They're it, really.

359
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,240
Yeah, but Joshua and Ryan seem to have pretty good heads on their shoulders.

360
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,420
It's pretty interesting to watch all of that.

361
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,200
To see the broader market.

362
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,840
So if you're interested, please do help them out.

363
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,080
I think this is going to... If things keep going like they're going, this is going to

364
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
be a big project.

365
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,080
Yeah.

366
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
I'm hoping... Here's what I'm hoping.

367
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,080
I'm hoping MyCraft test production unit, Linux Fest Northwest, hands-on.

368
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
Yes.

369
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
Hands-on.

370
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
Right?

371
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,080
That would be the thing.

372
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
And then we'd be one of the few places with cameras there-

373
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,840
Maybe we can ask it to play the live stream.

374
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
Oh my gosh.

375
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
That would be-

376
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
That could happen.

377
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
If you could say, MyCraft.

378
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
MyCraft, play JBLive.

379
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,360
We have to get its name right.

380
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
That's prerequisite.

381
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
I want to call it JARVIS.

382
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,360
You should be able to call it whatever you want, right?

383
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,360
Computer.

384
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
Wouldn't that be nice?

385
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
Computer.

386
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
Computer.

387
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
Play JBLive.

388
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
And then it starts the stream.

389
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,360
That would be so awesome.

390
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,600
So I'm hoping we get our hands on, because we're going to have cameras there.

391
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,720
We're going to have the whole crew there.

392
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
Everybody get to play with it.

393
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
We'll all get our thoughts.

394
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
We'll see.

395
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,240
We shall see.

396
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,280
And you know that back end... Because one of the nice things about MyCraft, you can

397
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,360
deploy your own back end infrastructure.

398
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,800
You can deploy that on a DigitalOcean droplet.

399
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,480
Oh, that's right, DigitalOcean's sponsor of the Linux Unplugged program.

400
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,060
Go to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

401
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,060
One word.

402
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,060
Lowercase.

403
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,060
Ultimate power.

404
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,120
You hear those clowns over at the Linux Action Show, they have a new promo code?

405
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Losers.

406
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,860
Screw those guys.

407
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,160
We got DOUNPLUGGED and we've had that for a long time.

408
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,400
Go unplug your DO droplet.

409
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Well don't unplug it.

410
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,780
That would be bad.

411
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,400
Unplug your mind and expand it by creating a DigitalOcean droplet.

412
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
DigitalOcean.com.

413
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,080
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED and you get a $10 credit.

414
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,080
You can start in less than 55 seconds.

415
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,080
And pricey plans?

416
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,640
They start at only $5 a month.

417
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,680
You see how that DOUNPLUGGED is going to hook you up.

418
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,760
You get 512 megabytes of RAM at $5 a month.

419
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,480
A 20 gigabyte SSD because they all SSDs.

420
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,320
All SSDs with one CPU and a terabyte of transfer.

421
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,280
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

422
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,200
London, and I believe a brand new one.

423
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Brand new.

424
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
In India.

425
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
It's crazy.

426
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,920
They've got a simple interface, that intuitive control panel, and that powerful and straightforward

427
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
API.

428
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
API.

429
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
They've got a straightforward API, Wes.

430
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,720
And you've got to go check it out at DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

431
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,000
Their pricing plans are simple and straightforward.

432
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,480
They've got one click deployment of a bunch of great open source applications using all

433
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
open source code.

434
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,920
The entire stack from the virtualizer all the way up, they're using open source code

435
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
there.

436
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
AVL.

437
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Love it.

438
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
Love it.

439
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,120
And then when you get going, they have tutorials to take it even further.

440
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,240
If you go to their community section, they've got write-ups on all those things you need

441
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
to know.

442
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,480
These are some of the best tutorials in the community.

443
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,760
Like Let's Encrypt.

444
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
That's a hot topic right now.

445
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,240
They've got Prometheus, package management basics, how to use Tink, how to use Puppet.

446
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
All of these things.

447
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,800
And DigitalOcean has gots it.

448
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,160
And it just makes your experience even better.

449
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
So go to DigitalOcean.com.

450
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,440
Go check out all of the good stuff.

451
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,200
Look at the incredible pricing.

452
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,680
And if you really want to feel like it's 2016, like if you've just been like, ho hum, Back

453
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,920
to the Future said it was going to be awesome and you're not feeling like it's really 2016,

454
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,480
I got something for you.

455
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,760
Install Docker on your laptop or your desktop.

456
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,200
Create a really cool Docker image.

457
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,640
And then go deploy to a DigitalOcean droplet in seconds and realize, okay, yeah, it's 2016.

458
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,660
I just spun up a super powerful server with crazy fast bandwidth with all of my software

459
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,080
config that was completely identical on my laptop in seconds.

460
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,200
It's very cool.

461
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,520
And you know, even if you don't use any of that stuff, if you just want a Linux rig,

462
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,120
you can SSH into and just poke around, a great opportunity.

463
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,760
DigitalOcean.com.

464
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,240
Just use that promo code, DOUNPLUGGED.

465
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,560
Big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

466
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,240
Wes, you got yourself here one of them early edition Sputniks, right?

467
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
Yes, I do.

468
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,760
The first one, if I don't make a mistake there.

469
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,600
And you know, that's what my son uses too.

470
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,680
And it's a pretty great laptop, but this week, a new laptop entered the scene.

471
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,680
It's making me jealous.

472
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah, the new Skylake-based Dell XPS 13 with Ubuntu pre-installed is arriving in the US.

473
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,760
It's a fifth generation Intel.

474
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
So that's not bad.

475
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:50,440
With an i7, you know, it's a two-core, up to 16 gigabytes of RAM and a nice fatty SSD

476
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,600
loaded out of the gate with Ubuntu.

477
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Are you tempted, Wes?

478
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Oh, yeah.

479
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Are you?

480
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,360
I mean, I've been looking at these new ones with that tiny bezel for a long time now.

481
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,360
Yeah, that is nice.

482
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,360
Yeah, that, yeah.

483
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,760
And I guess on these new ones, they're also offering a lot of these in their business

484
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,980
precision line, but with the same form factor.

485
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,280
So I think that would be the one I would be looking at.

486
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
Yeah.

487
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,600
Their precision line workstation notebooks, the Precision 5510, 3510, and 7510, and 7710,

488
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,600
15 and 17-inch variants are also available.

489
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,880
I believe they're more configurable, like they're less locked down.

490
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Yeah.

491
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,880
So the XPS 13 is a small, tiny laptop that's really nice.

492
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,640
Don't have any word yet on when they're going to support 16.04.

493
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,200
They're shipping with 14.04 right now.

494
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,360
I mean, I didn't install Arch anyway, so I don't know why you're wasting my time here,

495
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Chris.

496
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
Hey-o!

497
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,920
So up to 16 gigabytes of memory, a 512-gigabyte solid-state drive.

498
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,560
I don't understand this, and this is where I don't feel like Dell has yet matured to

499
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:55,160
a true Linux vendor, is 14.04 is just not a good choice if you're shipping on a high

500
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,880
DPI display.

501
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,920
This is a soapbox I've gone up on before.

502
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:04,000
It's not a – I guess they must have used – yeah, yeah, yeah, because you can only

503
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,480
go to, what, GTK 3.10 in 14.04, and that's only the very initial high DPI support in

504
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,680
your GTK applications, and it's gotten so much better since then, and you're really

505
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
missing out.

506
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:23,400
And so when you ship a laptop with a 3,200 by 1,800 resolution, and you don't –

507
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,360
Close to 16's release.

508
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
Yeah, exactly.

509
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,600
That's why it will be a really nice upgrade to 16.04 when they do ship.

510
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,880
Hopefully it's not too long.

511
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,400
You know Project Sputnik's been going since 2012.

512
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,760
And so that's actually a pretty old laptop in computer terms you've got there.

513
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,760
Yeah, it is.

514
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,560
And when they first did it, I was a little – I was actually pretty skeptical.

515
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,040
I didn't think this was a good idea.

516
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,440
I also basically didn't think Dell was going to stick with it.

517
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
No.

518
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,120
Well, in all time, it's kind of just been this one little thing, not on the side.

519
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,680
I am encouraged that they're expanding to the precision line.

520
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,760
I think that's a big story here.

521
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,840
And they've had some in the past, too.

522
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,240
This isn't the first time they've done this, but they've expanded the program even

523
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
more so.

524
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,840
And I think what they've done here that was really super smart, that the other OEMs

525
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,680
should take away from like your HPs and your La Navas, is they're targeting developers.

526
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,800
They're calling it the developer edition, right?

527
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,440
They're targeting power users.

528
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,360
And I think that has been key to a success because they're not saying this is the laptop

529
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,320
that will forever replace Windows.

530
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,480
This is a laptop that's better than a MacBook.

531
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,480
This is the MacBook killer.

532
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,800
They're not saying any of that.

533
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,240
What they're saying is if you want a developer laptop and you're a technical user, we've

534
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,240
got a computer for you.

535
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,280
Which is pretty neat because it makes it good like you're hired at your new job and then

536
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,020
I go, what do you need to work with?

537
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,880
You could say MacBook Pro or whatever, but now you could say something like this and

538
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,720
get nice hardware, nice screen.

539
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Very much so.

540
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
You don't need to have work or probably order from Dell.

541
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
Right.

542
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,720
They already have a supplier there.

543
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Yeah.

544
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
That is a big deal.

545
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Now, not available outside the U.S. yet.

546
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
Good to know.

547
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,880
But I think some of the precision machines are, which might be better rigs to go with

548
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,280
anyways depending on your needs.

549
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,280
Probably more expensive.

550
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
Okay.

551
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,280
So let's ask the mumble room.

552
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,440
Anybody in the mumble room, you know, tempted to pick up a laptop, maybe put funds aside.

553
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,040
Let's put yourself in the market for a laptop right now.

554
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Around 2000.

555
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,040
Chris Lass is buying.

556
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Around 50.

557
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,040
Yeah.

558
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
That's a big coin.

559
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Well, it's about $400, everybody.

560
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,480
You know, something around $15,000 to $2000, a nice high-end laptop, and you want it to

561
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,840
run Linux.

562
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:28,880
Can somebody give me a reason why you wouldn't necessarily go with this laptop at this point?

563
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,880
That says it right there.

564
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
I think.

565
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Look at Dell.

566
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,200
I can't think of, I mean, other than if you want a larger screen, but then you go to precision.

567
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,100
So you know, I'm hoping now that this really spurs on System76 to really step up.

568
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,480
They have some great machines.

569
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
They do.

570
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,040
And especially like in the higher end, like just on the pre-show, I was sort of wishing

571
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,200
that I had my Bonobo hooked up right here.

572
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,940
And on the Oryx Pro, like, right?

573
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:57,360
But when it comes down to these super light, really thin, good battery life, high-resolution

574
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,700
screens, I know for my XPS 13, which is the last model, that screen is damn good.

575
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,160
It's one of the best screens.

576
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
Yeah.

577
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,720
You know, I still look at it every now and then when I open up, I go, damn, I can't believe

578
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,160
this is a Linux computer.

579
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
I just can't even believe it.

580
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,160
And that's you.

581
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,160
Yeah.

582
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,400
I mean, and Apollo is great, and Entraware has a great hardware setup.

583
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,120
I think I would – my preference would be to go with System76 or Entraware first.

584
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,040
Yes, I agree.

585
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,520
But if they weren't – but if I wanted something like this, I would consider it.

586
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,520
I would.

587
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,760
Oh, I guess they say we're in a different channel on the Mumble Room.

588
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
Is that true, Wes?

589
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
Is that true?

590
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
That doesn't look true to me, Wes.

591
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
That don't look true to me.

592
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
If we are, double-click on there.

593
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,760
There you go.

594
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
All right.

595
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,760
So if anybody – sorry.

596
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,760
If we were in a different channel, I don't know how that could have happened.

597
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,480
But if you didn't get a chance to say something, your thoughts on the XPS 13 virtual log before

598
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
we move on?

599
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
No.

600
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:51,060
It seems like a great laptop.

601
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,720
And nobody had a reason why you wouldn't pick it up, right?

602
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
We didn't miss that?

603
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
No.

604
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
There's no major reason I could think of.

605
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,720
Other than – I mean, what about the fact that it's Dell?

606
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,000
They're all the same now.

607
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,040
Isn't it even cheaper, though, than the Windows one now?

608
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
I don't know if it is.

609
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,040
It used to not be.

610
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,040
Maybe it is now.

611
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,760
I thought I heard someone make a comment about that.

612
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,760
Hmm.

613
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,760
Hmm.

614
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Yeah.

615
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,560
But to say that it's just a Dell – I mean, Alienware is Dell, too, so.

616
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,560
Well –

617
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,320
Yeah, but you're just basically saying Alienware is awful now.

618
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,320
Well –

619
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,400
And you'll put a Linux sticker over the little Dell symbol, right?

620
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,480
I haven't yet on my other one.

621
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,160
I guess I just – I don't know.

622
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,240
I don't really know what Dell's future holds for them, but I'm glad they're doing it.

623
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,040
But at the same time, I look at the other vendors and go, so you're still planning to

624
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,680
just do that Windows thing, huh?

625
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
Right.

626
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
Still planning to ship Windows.

627
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,680
That's working for you, huh?

628
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
Okay.

629
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Yeah.

630
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
So, muhahaha.

631
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,920
You're a Dell fan, so defend them now that I've insulted the honest –

632
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,000
Yeah.

633
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,120
So I have two Dell laptops, and the first one holds five gear, and the cellist – one

634
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:00,120
– the one I have now is still going, and it's about six GM, maybe seven.

635
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,120
So it's held up well is what you're saying.

636
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
Yeah.

637
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
Yeah, that counts for something.

638
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,120
Yeah.

639
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,400
I have a laptop that its birthday was last week, and it's now 10 years old and still

640
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
runs and it's a Dell.

641
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,480
The other nice part is they're pretty easy to get parts for and service generally.

642
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,880
There's a lot of people who know how to fix Dell laptops.

643
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
That's true.

644
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
That is all true.

645
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,320
If you're a developer and you just want to get your job done and you want a nice support

646
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
contract –

647
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,320
It's a pretty good choice.

648
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,320
Yeah.

649
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,320
I would shop around.

650
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
Those support contracts.

651
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
That's right.

652
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,320
Yeah.

653
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,320
So you want to buy one?

654
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,320
Let's just look.

655
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
We're not going to actually buy one, but I've got the XPS 13 laptop up here, the Dell

656
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,320
figure.

657
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,960
So I figured before we got done here, let's just see.

658
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,000
So it starts here with a couple of different – I wonder if I'm on the right one.

659
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,880
It's kind of hard to find the Ubuntu edition.

660
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,880
I don't feel like I'm on the right one because these ones have Windows stickers.

661
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,160
So let's start by trying to find it, and let's just Google search for it, okay?

662
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,160
We're going to get the full experience.

663
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
Are you ready?

664
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,160
Yeah.

665
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
Okay.

666
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
We are Linux users who need a new laptop.

667
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,320
So, yeah, let's say we're going to search for Ubuntu Dell XPS, okay?

668
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
That should be enough, don't you think?

669
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,320
I would hope so.

670
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,320
Okay.

671
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
There we go.

672
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,160
The Dell Developer XPS 13 Edition.

673
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,080
First link on our Google search results.

674
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
Easy peasy.

675
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,080
All right.

676
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,080
Didn't even have to bother with the Dell site.

677
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,560
I'm feeling good already because that's usually where I go wrong.

678
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Oh, look.

679
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
It's Ubuntu right there.

680
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
Yeah, Ubuntu right there.

681
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
Now, look at this, Wes.

682
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:22,520
We've got two editions to choose from, one that starts at $899.99 and one that's $1,049.

683
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,720
I'm kind of inclined to say –

684
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
What's the difference?

685
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,840
Well, I think the huge difference here is a faster processor.

686
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,400
Well, you're going to need that.

687
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,680
But otherwise, the specs look – let's customize the $1,000 one.

688
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,240
I have work to get done here.

689
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,240
Yeah.

690
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
I do like a fast rig.

691
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:48,320
So you really get – so you can upgrade to 256 gig solid state.

692
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,160
These all say fifth generation i7.

693
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
Are these the last ones?

694
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Oh, it must be.

695
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,440
No, though, because mine's an i7.

696
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,560
So I can't change it to an i7 from here.

697
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
So the final –

698
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
The fifth generation.

699
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,560
Yeah.

700
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,560
These are all – the new ones are Skylake.

701
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
Yeah, that's true.

702
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
That is true.

703
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
But you know what?

704
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
They're marketing this.

705
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,600
Yeah, maybe they're not available for – well, that's too bad.

706
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,320
So why make the announcement yet?

707
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,760
Double check on that for me, Wes.

708
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,820
So it looked like it was around – that one was around $1,100, $1,400, depending on how

709
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,240
you configure it.

710
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Fifth generation is Skylake.

711
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,240
Sixth generation?

712
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,240
Yes.

713
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,240
Well, then those probably are.

714
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,280
So they're not actually available for sale yet.

715
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,200
That's too bad.

716
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,320
I was going to see how much it would be if we wanted to configure one right now.

717
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,320
I want it right now.

718
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Yeah, yeah.

719
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
Would you consider upgrading yours?

720
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,480
I mean, is that your personal machine or is that a work laptop?

721
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,120
It is a work laptop.

722
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,200
It's an extra work laptop, which is why it's good enough for now.

723
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,960
But I have been – I mean, I have been – one of these days, I'm just going to snap and

724
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,960
buy a new laptop.

725
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
Yeah?

726
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
Would this be on your list?

727
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,960
It's very high on my list.

728
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,960
You know what's confusing?

729
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,480
It's hard because they all called the new.

730
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,040
So they say the new XPS 13 developer edition, and it starts at $1,500, but then you – oh,

731
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
wait a minute.

732
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,880
Well, look at this, Wes.

733
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
What changed?

734
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
What?

735
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,880
I don't know what changed, but now you're –

736
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,320
Now you're on the new, new, new developer edition.

737
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,160
Yeah, and now it's sixth generation.

738
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,400
What the hell just happened?

739
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
What the?

740
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Holy crap.

741
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
All right.

742
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Well, here on Linux Unplugged, we've unlocked the secret code necessary.

743
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,080
I wonder if I just had to refresh the page.

744
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,160
That might have been it.

745
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
So here we go, Wes.

746
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,160
It starts – holy smokes.

747
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,280
It starts at $1,500, but it goes all the way up to $2,300.

748
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,620
You get a one-terabyte hard drive.

749
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,620
So let's go with the middle –

750
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,620
So it really is in the MacBook Pro.

751
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,620
Yes.

752
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,620
Let's go in the midrange.

753
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,620
Let's start with a 512.

754
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,880
I can't go below 512 for my main work machine, right?

755
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
I mean, that's –

756
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,440
I'm all right with 256, but let's go 512.

757
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,600
In what world, Wes?

758
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
In what world?

759
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
Jeez Louise, Wes.

760
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Jeez Louise, that's disgusting.

761
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,960
Sixty gigabytes of RAM, 512-gigabyte PCIe solid state.

762
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
Oh, PCIe.

763
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
Yeah.

764
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,960
Oh, boy.

765
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,960
Tasty.

766
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
Oh, boy.

767
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,120
Oh, boy.

768
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,260
So that's funny.

769
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,480
So by the way, don't Google search for like what we did because you might get that same

770
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
result we did.

771
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
Yeah.

772
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
Do not imitate.

773
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,820
We re-clicked on the logo of the XPS developer edition and it loaded this page.

774
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,080
So be careful how you search because you might get to the wrong thing.

775
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,000
So ours is going to be $1,949.99.

776
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Okay.

777
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Okay.

778
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Okay.

779
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I can see it.

780
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:24,360
Boy, it's barely worth that, I mean at least based on mine, unless they've improved the

781
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,360
build quality a little bit.

782
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
Right.

783
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,900
There's the case gives – it's a plastic case.

784
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,160
It gives – and the other thing is is where you rest your wrist right here, see they're

785
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,720
showing that right here, yeah, it's the same exact material.

786
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
It shows stains like an SOB.

787
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
Oh.

788
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,720
That's disappointing.

789
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,240
And like when you're sitting there like we all do when you're sitting there eating chicken

790
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,680
wings and browsing Reddit.

791
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,680
You get chicken –

792
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
The truth comes out.

793
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
You get grease.

794
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,440
You get wing grease on your laptop and ain't nobody –

795
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,680
Is this why you won't bring that to the studio?

796
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,680
You're too embarrassed.

797
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
It's just filthy.

798
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,680
No, man.

799
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,680
It smells delicious.

800
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
I want it at home.

801
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
I want it heated up gently.

802
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
It smells great.

803
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,680
Yeah, it's great.

804
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,680
Yeah, the build quality.

805
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
So the build – I don't know.

806
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,680
$2,000 for a Dell is –

807
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,520
Then you imagine what you can spend that money on a desktop.

808
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
Yeah.

809
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
Yeah, exactly.

810
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
Oh, yeah.

811
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,600
With a really nice – that's the other thing is the Intel graphics is not cutting it for

812
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
me.

813
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,560
And when you throw high DPI in there, it's even worse.

814
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
So if you just get like a nice –

815
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
This is –

816
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,880
Full HD, you know, like 1080p laptop and then you can spend your money on your beautiful

817
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
desktop.

818
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,240
I was trying a little, you know, a little game in here on the Apollo which is the Sky

819
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,920
Lake Iris.

820
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
Still not good enough.

821
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:34,520
Still – so, boy, if $2,000 – I might be wrong.

822
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
Let's go check.

823
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,100
But I think when you get into a $2,000 Apple laptop, I think you get dedicated graphics.

824
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,980
You get the Iris Plus.

825
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,600
Right now it's an AMD.

826
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,640
Is that how – okay, so let's go look.

827
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,800
So would that be a MacBook Pro?

828
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,800
And I guess this maybe isn't a fair benchmark but it kind of seems like, you know, you have

829
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:59,240
to at least consider that one of the better selling competitors – but they don't offer

830
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,640
dedicated graphics in a 13-inch form factor.

831
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
So you do have to step up –

832
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
Oh, that is a difference.

833
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,440
You do have to step up to 13-inch but, yeah, when you – or I'm sorry, 15-inch.

834
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:12,160
But once you step up to 15-inch, you get a legitimate quad-core processor on the MacBook

835
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,600
instead of the dual-core i7.

836
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:20,240
You get 256 gigabytes of PCIe storage, not as good as the Dell.

837
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,640
And you get the Iris Pro video.

838
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,440
I don't see dedicated graphics on this one actually.

839
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,440
Oh, okay.

840
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,440
Well, then maybe you have to go a little more expensive.

841
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,440
Yeah, you might.

842
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,440
So, okay.

843
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,440
All right.

844
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,520
I just – for $2,000, I want my damn dedicated graphics and I want my damn dedicated graphics

845
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,520
real bad.

846
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,560
Although, even at a – unless you get something like the Oryx, a lot of the dedicated in the

847
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:43,360
laptops are still – they're better but it's not what you pay for, you know?

848
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,360
Yeah.

849
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:51,120
I want something around $1,000 that's really – like the Centraware starts at a good price,

850
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,120
the Apollo, right?

851
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
Yeah.

852
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
So, yeah.

853
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
It's closer.

854
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
But, yeah.

855
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,440
The marketing is done by Dell.

856
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,440
Look at our beards.

857
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,480
We sell Linux as system T.

858
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,360
Mumbo room, anybody else want to talk about the XPS?

859
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,440
Either we're being unfair or maybe we're being too fair.

860
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,440
Go ahead and share your thoughts.

861
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,440
Going once, going twice.

862
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:15,400
I think what it comes down to is that Dell might be trying to shift – excuse me, shift

863
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:20,880
over from being just strictly a Windows OEM and they're trying to get that Linux crowd

864
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,360
a bit.

865
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:28,480
Looking at the System76 Oryx Pro and even at a 15-inch or 17-inch, it's still a better

866
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,600
deal for under $2,000.

867
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,600
Wow.

868
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Oh, really?

869
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Yeah.

870
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:41,120
Like, it's like $1,300 and you're getting a GTX 970 or a 980 mobile from NVIDIA.

871
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
Oh, boy.

872
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:48,080
And so it's like, good try Dell, but dude, System76 is killing it on these deals.

873
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,080
Yeah.

874
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,560
So how much is the super thin lightweight worth and I guess it all comes down to your

875
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
workflow.

876
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
Yep.

877
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,560
That's your like main workstation.

878
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:02,080
He said something there, Wes, that I wanted to – do you think this is Dell's hedge against

879
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,760
Windows collapsing and are they just doing it in a way that is hyper-focused and they're

880
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
able to learn from?

881
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,800
Because obviously they're focusing, like we mentioned, at developers.

882
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,800
Yep.

883
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,800
And I think that –

884
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,880
But if you're Dell, you're Michael Dell and you're like, you've got to look at your money,

885
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
you see where your money's spent.

886
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,440
You see this group of like eight or ten guys and gals that are burning money on working

887
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
for Linux.

888
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
Why are you spending that money?

889
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,200
Why is Michael Dell spending that money, Wes?

890
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,720
You know, I think it kind of – it might play also into the enterprise shift.

891
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,960
You know, they bought EMC.

892
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,160
They were looking at kind of focusing on enterprise and I think if you're going to still be selling,

893
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:42,840
you know, workstation level components, Linux is a good bet for that kind of like power

894
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
user.

895
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
Yeah.

896
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
And maybe you're building web apps.

897
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
Yeah.

898
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,840
And infrastructure.

899
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,840
Yeah.

900
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,720
The red pepper, you had a point to make about workstations.

901
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,080
Go ahead.

902
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:01,520
You can always order a Dell Precision 15-inch laptop with Fibonacci on it.

903
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,520
Yeah.

904
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,880
The Precisions now, they've expanded with this announcement.

905
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,680
They've expanded the Precision line with more customizability and so maybe one day we'll

906
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,160
see Wes show up with a Precision.

907
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:18,600
You know, I love – if I had unlimited money, if I could have all of the laptops in the

908
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,520
world, I think I would like to have the Apollo for my portability instead of an XPS.

909
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:28,120
I actually think – my truly unbiased opinion having the XPS 13, the last generation, and

910
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,000
having the Apollo, the Apollo is a better computer and the trackpad is better on the

911
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Apollo.

912
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Wow.

913
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,080
So for portability, I think the Apollo is better.

914
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,080
But –

915
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,080
I really want to just slide that into my bag when I leave.

916
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,080
I'm not going to lie.

917
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:45,160
At the same time, I want some of the features and power of the Oryx and I actually have

918
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,880
had some limited production capabilities with the Apollo because it's not powerful enough.

919
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,600
So part of me, if I had unlimited money, Wes, I would have the Apollo as like my portable

920
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:00,360
machine and the Oryx as my – I got to do a whole bunch of work and I'm doing it between

921
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,240
the studio and home all the time and that would be my machine.

922
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,600
And I would have two laptops because there's not a perfect laptop for me right now.

923
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:13,120
There's not one that answers all the things like the – the thing about the Apollo, lightweight,

924
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,240
super easy to –

925
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,240
Sturdy construction.

926
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,240
Yeah.

927
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,960
So it makes it very easy to move it around because it's really sturdy and a very small

928
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,320
power adapter.

929
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,560
The plus about the Oryx would be it has a great graphics card in it, a great desktop

930
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,560
class CPU.

931
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,560
You can do whatever you throw it at.

932
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,560
Exactly.

933
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
But it's huge.

934
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
It's heavy.

935
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
It has a big power brick.

936
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
And fans.

937
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Yeah.

938
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Yeah, that too.

939
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,320
This thing has never once – once – the fans have never once spun up on air, which

940
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,640
is a huge thing for me because then it makes it sound better.

941
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,680
Stopping the show, complaining about the fans.

942
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,280
It happens almost every other week until the Apollo.

943
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,840
And the Apollo has better battery life than the Oryx.

944
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,600
I would guess because it's all Intel and no dedicated graphics.

945
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:55,920
But either way, yeah, I don't feel like I could land on one single laptop right now.

946
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,560
I guess the way to strike that distance would be to have – or to strike that balance would

947
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:05,120
be to have a pretty well-built desktop PC that's within reason and then have a nice

948
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
portable laptop.

949
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
Right.

950
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:11,600
And then – but still, I'm just trying to justify how you spend $2,000 on a computer

951
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,600
that is limited to 16 gigs of RAM and doesn't have dedicated graphics.

952
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,240
Maybe I'm just a PC master race guy.

953
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,800
I mean, I don't even – I'm not trying to be like, oh, you've got to have fast components.

954
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,560
But $2,000 and you don't have dedicated graphics and you can only do 16 gigs of RAM, that sounds

955
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,060
crazy to me.

956
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,800
On the other side, I get frustrated that the RAM is always lock-stepped with the other

957
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
components.

958
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,240
Like, maybe I don't need the 512 because I do a better job of keeping my file system

959
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,240
organized than Chris does.

960
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,240
Right.

961
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,840
You know, or I don't need the super nice touch, I just want the full HD.

962
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Yes, right.

963
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,880
You can never get the like 16 gigs and 32 gigs in that model.

964
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
Yeah.

965
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,880
Yeah, yeah.

966
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,760
Okay, Muhahaha, tell me about this.

967
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,960
You think it's – for $2,000, you say it's worth it if – as long as you get a good

968
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,800
amount of use out of it, like several years, maybe more?

969
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,800
What do you think?

970
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,120
Yeah, I think it's fine.

971
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,640
But how do you get five years of use out of a computer that doesn't have dedicated graphics

972
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,760
and is locked to 16 gigs of RAM?

973
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,160
Seriously, how do you get five years out of that?

974
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,840
Debbie unstable and never change a thing.

975
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:22,000
So I think you – okay, I don't think you can do it if you are planning to game, but

976
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,920
if you're just planning to use it for development, yeah, just browsing, okay, maybe browsing

977
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,840
maybe that is kind of overpowered, but yeah.

978
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,840
I don't know, man.

979
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,440
You know, I just read something, Wes, today.

980
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,440
Didn't you link it to me?

981
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,840
One of the features, and the reason why I didn't put it in the show is because I didn't

982
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:43,240
understand it, so I didn't want to read it on air, but one of the features in kernel

983
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,360
4.5 is a bunch of work on the new open source AMD driver, right?

984
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,280
Yes, I believe so.

985
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,740
And I don't know – can you pull up our thread on that computer and pull that up because

986
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:56,800
– maybe I can, because one of the things – and this is why I didn't include it in

987
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:06,880
the show is they talk about accelerating ButterFS file system calculations using the AMD GPU.

988
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,200
So if you're following me here, that would mean your file system runs faster because

989
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,920
it's using the GPU to crunch numbers.

990
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,280
That – yeah, okay, let's see.

991
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:21,840
Also, by the way, it has better PS2 support, Wes points out.

992
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Super important.

993
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,800
When you need that very accurate PS2 mouse.

994
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,600
Here's why – here's the part that it says – this is why I didn't read it on air.

995
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,780
So they say, so what's exactly so promising about Linux kernel 4.5?

996
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:39,600
It includes an implementation of initial support for the AMD PowerPlay power management technology,

997
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:46,440
and it also brings high performance to the AMD GPU open source driver for Radeon GPUs.

998
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:55,080
As a result, it will improve scalability in the free space handling of the ButterFS file

999
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:01,100
system, and it will have better EPOL multi-threaded scalability.

1000
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,200
So this article is saying that the – I don't – this is why I didn't – this just got

1001
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,800
– I'm just shooing this in, but this thing is claiming that the improved GPU drivers

1002
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,420
will help with ButterFS free space calculations.

1003
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,720
How can that be a thing?

1004
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,720
And if it –

1005
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
It's not a thing.

1006
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,720
Okay.

1007
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,720
It's not a thing.

1008
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,720
There's supposed to be separate things.

1009
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,920
They added a new free space map cache to ButterFS in version 4.5.

1010
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,840
Okay, good, good, good.

1011
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,840
All right.

1012
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,000
So because my point was going to be – but I can't – and that's why I was like that

1013
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
can't be right.

1014
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,520
There's no way that's right, but where I was going with this is I see future workloads

1015
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:43,740
that are improved because your GPU takes some of the compute.

1016
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:48,160
It's already here today, but it's mostly here in production work.

1017
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:54,760
So when you tell me that this XPS 13 is a five-year computer, I don't know.

1018
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,720
I don't know if that's true.

1019
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
I don't know if that's true.

1020
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,240
I think there's a certain class of people that don't – they can't have a five-year

1021
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:09,020
computer, and you might be one of them.

1022
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,020
Maybe on a desktop.

1023
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,680
Maybe on a nice desktop that you don't game on.

1024
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,680
That's okay.

1025
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,560
Well, so there you go.

1026
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,560
There you go.

1027
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,560
Fine.

1028
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,560
Fine.

1029
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
That's just fine for Chris.

1030
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
But that's not that there's anything wrong with that.

1031
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,360
And there are some users that you can have an older ThinkPad and use it for a long time

1032
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,360
and it works great.

1033
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,360
Yeah, that's true.

1034
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,360
That's a good point, Wes.

1035
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,360
That's a good point.

1036
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,640
Yeah, I guess where I was going with this is I guess what I was trying to say and I'm

1037
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,040
not saying it very well is I think there will be future work tasks and loads that are automatically

1038
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,200
offloaded to the GPU that you as an end user don't even realize like your web browser

1039
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,160
and its rendering or how your menu pops up when you go to search for applications on

1040
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,160
your computer.

1041
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,160
Oh, yeah.

1042
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,160
Lots of interaction stuff is being –

1043
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,160
Yeah.

1044
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,560
Today and in the future, more and more stuff will be GPU accelerated.

1045
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,440
And if you don't have a computer that has a good GPU, you're going to be left behind

1046
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
a little bit.

1047
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,440
Your system's – that's all I'm saying.

1048
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:01,100
You see that software rendering pop up and you get sad and everything's slow.

1049
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,120
And for me, when I'm using my XPS 13, that just means, okay, this isn't a time I could

1050
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,120
play games.

1051
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,120
I just – I can't play games on this computer.

1052
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,120
And that's kind of a bummer sometimes.

1053
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,640
I mean, there's always race to the sun.

1054
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,640
That barely works.

1055
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,640
That barely works.

1056
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,640
Really?

1057
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,840
Well, part of the issue is 4K.

1058
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:22,000
And then part of the issue is so many games right now suck at changing their resolution.

1059
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,360
And so when you try to run it in windowed mode, it still gets really funky.

1060
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,080
So there's just a lot of rough spots still.

1061
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,120
And it makes gaming frustrating on the XPS.

1062
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,120
It's just not even worth it.

1063
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,120
Where you stream it from your computer.

1064
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,120
I don't know.

1065
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,120
Probably different games.

1066
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,680
Like a different – my kids can play Minecraft.

1067
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,680
That works pretty well.

1068
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,680
Right.

1069
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,680
So there you go.

1070
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,680
That works.

1071
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,840
That works, Wes.

1072
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:47,320
But things like – like actual game games that are like not – that aren't like

1073
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,320
–

1074
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,320
That aren't written in Java?

1075
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,320
Yeah.

1076
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,320
Those don't play so well.

1077
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,320
Mm-hmm.

1078
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,320
Mm-hmm.

1079
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,320
Yeah.

1080
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,320
All right, Mumbo.

1081
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,320
Any other thoughts on the Linux laptop topic before we move on?

1082
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,320
Going twice.

1083
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,320
Going twice.

1084
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,160
All right.

1085
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
So let's talk – let's take a break.

1086
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,760
Let's take a moment to reset before we get into something that is looking out into the

1087
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,760
future of it.

1088
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,760
Let's talk about Ting.

1089
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,760
All right, everybody.

1090
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,960
I'll talk about something you can get right now.

1091
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,280
You don't got to wait until the future.

1092
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,160
You don't have to wait until Captain Picard on the Enterprise comes by and has the solution

1093
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,160
for you.

1094
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,160
No, friends.

1095
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,760
Get out there right now.

1096
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,160
And go to linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com, Wes.

1097
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,680
You go there right now and you'll get a $25 discount off your first device.

1098
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,600
Or if you have a Ting compatible device and they got CDMA and GSM, guess what?

1099
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,760
They'll put $25 towards your first month or whatever.

1100
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,980
Like your average Ting bill right now, $24 a line.

1101
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,960
So $25 in credit is going to pay for more than your first month.

1102
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,560
It's your minutes, your messages, your megabytes.

1103
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,560
They add them up.

1104
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,680
Whatever bucket you fall into, that's all you pay.

1105
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,840
It's $6 for the line.

1106
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,840
That is Ting.

1107
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,040
They got a bunch of great devices.

1108
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,040
They're unlocked.

1109
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,320
You can get them from Ting directly or you can bring your own.

1110
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,320
They have no contract, no early termination fee, and they have a really good dashboard

1111
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,620
and fanatically good customer service.

1112
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,620
That's Ting right there.

1113
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,620
It sells itself.

1114
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,620
I don't need to sell it.

1115
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,620
It sells itself.

1116
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,280
But one thing that's kind of cool is they're geeks.

1117
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,040
And you can see this in some of their blog posts.

1118
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,320
They did a blog post about cord cutters.

1119
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,320
They've been doing a whole series about cord cutters.

1120
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,320
They love cord cutters.

1121
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,320
Yeah, they do.

1122
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:21,800
They talk about how cord cutting not only saves you money, which is kind of obvious,

1123
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,640
but also saves you a whole bunch of time.

1124
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,580
The geeks over at Ting did the math and it's unbelievable.

1125
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:33,360
Not only do you learn a little bit about how commercials work in television, which is pretty

1126
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:38,680
insightful, but you also get a little idea of how much time you save when you stream

1127
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:43,040
shows without commercials versus watching shows or even like DVRing through them.

1128
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,040
It's a pretty cool blog post.

1129
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,520
They've got a whole bunch of good stuff.

1130
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,020
Start by going to linux.ting.com.

1131
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:50,600
That supports this show, gets you the discount, and lets them know you heard about it.

1132
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:55,280
See, the best part, they let us put – Linux is now a sub-domain on their website.

1133
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,280
Isn't that wonderful?

1134
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,720
That says it all that you need to know about Ting right there.

1135
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,720
Yes, it does.

1136
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,720
Exactly.

1137
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,440
It is very, very cool.

1138
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,440
Go check them out.

1139
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,240
Go get a great device from GSM Cards starting at $9.

1140
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,240
All the way up to feature phones.

1141
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,240
With Amazon Prime.

1142
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,240
Yes.

1143
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,240
Get it just as soon as you possibly want.

1144
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,240
Yes.

1145
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,240
Put it in anything.

1146
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,800
Then they've got, of course, feature phones and basic Android phones that are just nice,

1147
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,880
clean Android phones all the way up to the high-end luxury phones.

1148
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,840
I'm thinking of having like a, oh no, the internet went out again, emergency gateway

1149
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,160
with Ting, $6 a month.

1150
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,000
I probably won't use it like nine months out of the year.

1151
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Here's a nice thing.

1152
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,800
If you had a way to activate it when your internet goes out, you could just turn the

1153
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,520
line on and off, and then you're not even paying the $6.

1154
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,520
Exactly.

1155
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,820
And then just transparent internet.

1156
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,060
Don't tell Ting I told you that.

1157
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:43,480
But you could go get one of their MiFi devices, or whichever one you want, just grab a SIM.

1158
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,600
There's no contract, and you just pay for $6.

1159
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:51,840
If you forget to turn it off, you'll pay $6.

1160
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:56,480
If you say to yourself, you say, self, it's worth it to me to pay $6 a month to have internet

1161
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,480
always available.

1162
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,480
Honestly, it is.

1163
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,600
Yeah, it is.

1164
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,120
Then you could just pay $6 a month.

1165
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:06,240
But you could also turn it off, and then use the Ting app on your phone to then turn the

1166
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,520
line back on when your internet goes out, and then good to go.

1167
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,160
Because if the internet goes out, I know.

1168
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,160
Yeah, yeah, you do.

1169
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,160
Right away.

1170
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,160
Oh, there's no missing out on that.

1171
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,160
I'm in a terrible mood.

1172
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,160
Yeah.

1173
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,160
Where's all my stuff?

1174
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,160
Linux.ting.com.

1175
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,040
Go there, support this show, check out Ting, get yourself a discount.

1176
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,840
Big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

1177
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:29,600
I don't know what it is about these snappy packages, Wes, but I continue to feel like

1178
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,600
a dope.

1179
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,600
It's gotta be in your bonnet.

1180
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,800
Well, I struggle because it's a whole bunch of different type of technologies.

1181
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,720
And you know what's funny about it?

1182
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,420
It's not even like the first attempt at this.

1183
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,240
It's maybe a different take on many attempts, we're gonna get to that.

1184
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:47,440
But I do wanna take a moment and talk about snappy packages.

1185
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,200
So there's Snappy Personal, their new approach to package management and updating is designed

1186
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,680
to be faster, more reliable, transactional with stronger security.

1187
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,480
Snappy for at least one of the desktop spins and of course, you got Snappy Core, you got

1188
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,760
the phone, they're all using snap packages.

1189
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,280
There's also on a future, which is still gonna be deb packages, a lot of the base OS will

1190
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,400
be using deb.

1191
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,640
Snap packages will be used to sort of unify the concept of package management against

1192
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,400
Internet of Things and desktops and all of this.

1193
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:20,960
So developers could create these snap packages that are like a package build from the AUR,

1194
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:26,560
so it's a script file that tells you where to go get all of the files, meets a container,

1195
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,800
meets PBIs, which are like statically linked libraries and all of that.

1196
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,760
Is this a good rough description, do you think, Wes, from your understanding?

1197
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,600
It seems to capture it.

1198
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,320
Basically, I mean it's pretty rough.

1199
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,320
There's a little more but...

1200
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,800
That's the snap package.

1201
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,600
And then there's a backend component to it that's run by Canonical that's sort of like

1202
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:49,360
the backend repo server, if you will, that is aware of where things are at and keys and

1203
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,240
whatnot and things like that.

1204
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,320
So this is another component to it.

1205
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:58,240
It's not a distributed system necessarily, it is a centralized system with a server.

1206
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:04,520
And this appears to be something that a lot of projects are trying to solve, this particular

1207
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,560
problem of distributing software.

1208
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,680
And there's different takes on how it should be done.

1209
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:14,000
A couple of them that are interesting is the GUIXSD, I don't know if you know about this

1210
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,120
one, Wes, but GNU's got an attempt at this one.

1211
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,680
Nix, I think is what it's called, Nix.

1212
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,400
Yeah, they're kind of sister distributions.

1213
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,400
Yeah, yeah.

1214
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,000
So you have Nix and you have GUIX and you have Limba, which is another project that's

1215
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
trying to do this.

1216
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
That's a new one to me.

1217
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,080
And you have, of course, XUG App, which is a big one from the GNOME folks.

1218
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,040
I've kind of been waiting to see what's going to happen there.

1219
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:40,120
And XUG Apps are sandbox apps that the whole goal here, they say, is allowing developers

1220
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:44,560
to distribute applications across Linux distributions, something we've talked about with Michael

1221
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,440
Dominic on Coderadios many, many times, even in the last week's episode, because he'd been

1222
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,840
running Ubuntu for a while.

1223
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,720
If I wanted to create an app, let's just crazy-pie this guy.

1224
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,520
Let's say, have you noticed how there is not really a great app store for Linux?

1225
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,120
Let's just say we could create an app store for all distributions, but how would you make

1226
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,320
applications you could distribute across all of those?

1227
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,520
You need something, you need something sandbox, something that takes into account all the

1228
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,540
different libraries and different versions of things.

1229
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:16,020
Sandbox applications are the future for that type of distributed application.

1230
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:19,120
Not all of our apps that we install are going to be sandbox, but the ones where it's like

1231
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:23,220
one click and you download and you run, these are going to be sandbox applications.

1232
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:26,000
That's the way these things, all of these different projects are going.

1233
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,080
And however they're implemented, that's where there's differences.

1234
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,960
SNAPs, SNAP packages are an Ubuntu-specific thing.

1235
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:37,280
XUG Apps are sort of a distribution agnostic kind of thing.

1236
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,280
Recently we talked about AppImage.

1237
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,280
Remember?

1238
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,280
Yeah, that was fun.

1239
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,680
Yeah, was that just last week we talked about AppImage or two weeks ago?

1240
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,720
Two weeks ago, which is essentially another download run anywhere thing.

1241
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,760
It's download an application, mark it executable, and run it.

1242
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,760
No need to install.

1243
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,760
No system libraries.

1244
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,760
Has similar SNAPs.

1245
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,760
You know, it has like a read-only kind of, you know your app doesn't change.

1246
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,960
It's not getting overwritten.

1247
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,720
All the dependencies are bundled together.

1248
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,040
So a lot of different takes on this.

1249
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,200
Anybody in the Mumber Room kind of maybe more familiar with SNAP packages and some of the

1250
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,160
technical details that maybe wants to fill in anything that I've missed here?

1251
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,960
You guys are welcome to jump in.

1252
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,160
And of course, the Chapman's pointed out, updates are going to be an interesting thing

1253
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,520
with SNAP packages because you'll have your base system updates and then you'll have to

1254
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,560
update your SNAP packages as well, which might have their own libraries and their own containers.

1255
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,200
But those will just be Delta updates, right?

1256
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,760
Is that what they're working on?

1257
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,760
Supposedly.

1258
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,760
Yeah, supposedly.

1259
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,760
Very much so.

1260
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,240
So we're going to get to a point in the future where there's going to be a lot of different

1261
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,320
like technologies that are essentially solving the same problem.

1262
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,320
Well, we're already there.

1263
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,400
It's just none of them have any large acceptance.

1264
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,640
When Ubuntu rolls out SNAP packages.

1265
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,640
That's going to be a big push.

1266
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,640
Yeah.

1267
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,640
Yeah.

1268
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,720
XGG Apps though is, you know, Fedora, Red Hat, Gnome behind that one.

1269
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,720
So I wonder.

1270
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,720
Yes.

1271
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,520
Kits and Kitty, you were asking about APT?

1272
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,520
Yes.

1273
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:00,680
So if I'm understanding this right, does this mean that SNAP packages will coexist on the

1274
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,920
same system as APT Git?

1275
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,920
Correct.

1276
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,920
Yeah.

1277
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,960
So basically the base OS is still going to be based on Debian.

1278
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,960
Ubuntu, whatever it's going to be, is still Debian based.

1279
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,800
The core OS packages are installed by APT.

1280
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,640
You can still install packages from APT.

1281
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:22,600
Think of it, I do in this term, I think of it as how the AUR has this user created applications

1282
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,520
and then Arch itself has repos, official repos.

1283
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,960
Well, I think the FreeBSD models may be a little better.

1284
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,960
Yeah, you're probably right.

1285
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,960
Yeah.

1286
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,960
Or, you know, in OSX land it's slash applications.

1287
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:32,960
Yeah.

1288
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,960
It's the same thing here.

1289
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:34,960
It's the same directory.

1290
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,080
But OSX doesn't have a base package manager, right?

1291
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,080
Well, no.

1292
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,080
You just get it all at once.

1293
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,080
It's the same thing.

1294
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,080
Yeah.

1295
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,080
Yeah.

1296
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,080
In this case, you still have devs getting updated in the background.

1297
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,080
Sure.

1298
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,080
You're now going to have your package manager is going to need to update.

1299
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:49,040
You're going to need to do an APT Git update and upgrade and SNAP package manager is going

1300
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,040
to do an upgrade.

1301
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,040
Right.

1302
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,720
I wonder if they'll wrap that in one or if it will be distinct.

1303
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,720
I would assume, right?

1304
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,720
Yeah.

1305
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,720
I would think so.

1306
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,720
Yeah.

1307
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,360
So the two will coexist because, I mean, let's be honest, they can't repackage everything

1308
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,600
in Debian as a SNAP.

1309
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,240
Yeah, becoming another Debian.

1310
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,240
Yeah.

1311
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,240
Yeah.

1312
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,920
And there's no benefit to that, really.

1313
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,320
So you have a couple of different technologies.

1314
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:18,640
The ones that I'm very interested in, besides SNAP packages, are XEG apps.

1315
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:24,920
They use cgroups, just like Docker containers do, and namespaces, could leverage SE Linux

1316
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,960
and KDBus in the future.

1317
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,520
And they're already writing today with Wayland in mind, which I think is really nice.

1318
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,520
See, that's nice.

1319
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:37,680
And I would – I mean, however we get to better sandboxed, better containerized or

1320
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,720
not applications, that would be a big win for Linux security.

1321
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,920
Do you think actually it would be a big win for security?

1322
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,920
Because the big pushback –

1323
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,920
I mean, it depends on how well it's done.

1324
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:50,840
The big pushback that seems – that everybody always talks about is don't bundle your dependencies.

1325
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:51,840
Don't statically link.

1326
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,520
Gentoo has this Wiki post here about why you shouldn't do it.

1327
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,000
Everybody always says the problem with PBIs is they include all of their own libraries,

1328
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,200
which means if there's a security vulnerability in open SSL, you have to update lib SSL on

1329
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,520
lib open SSL on all of those applications instead of just updating it once on your system.

1330
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,520
Is it better for security?

1331
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,920
See, that's a good point.

1332
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:18,440
I was more referring to the sandboxing parts of it, which I think Snappy has less as compared

1333
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,440
to maybe XEG.

1334
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,720
You know, where you're using cgroups, maybe you have a whole network namespace.

1335
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,180
I don't know.

1336
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,320
There is an issue with bundling dependencies.

1337
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,840
That's one thing that Linux users for a long time have kind of cited as like, hey, we don't

1338
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,840
do this.

1339
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,440
I guess it depends on how widespread it is.

1340
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,760
Like I like if the base system –

1341
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,760
And I think it –

1342
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,760
Oh, go on.

1343
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,120
I was going to say, I think it depends on who's doing the bundling.

1344
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,120
I think if it's upstream, the maintainers of the distro doing the bundling and they're

1345
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:48,320
actually keeping track of security updates and those sorts of things, it's fine.

1346
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,160
Like in the case of Snappy, if Canonical is doing the building of the snaps and they're

1347
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,720
actually being responsible and updating it, then it's fine.

1348
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,280
It'll come right from the same source they're getting the things in the distro.

1349
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,800
If it's coming from somebody who's responsible –

1350
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,800
If it's coming from somebody who's responsible –

1351
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,800
And all the bundling will be okay.

1352
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,800
Yeah.

1353
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,800
If it's coming from somebody who's responsible.

1354
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,800
Right.

1355
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:04,800
But that's kind of the problem is then when you let it go to developers, sometimes they

1356
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,800
are not responsible.

1357
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,800
They're fixing their bundle dependencies.

1358
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,800
Yeah.

1359
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,800
An example –

1360
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,800
Oh, go ahead.

1361
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,800
If you're getting Eclipse and it's given the Eclipse project, chances are they're just

1362
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,680
going to throw it all together into one great big snap and it's just going to be like,

1363
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,680
well, what if that changes?

1364
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,520
It's like, well, they're probably just going to say, oh, it works.

1365
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,520
Just don't use that.

1366
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,520
You know?

1367
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,520
Hmm.

1368
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,520
Yeah.

1369
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,440
I think that – I look at that and I go, there could be a possibility that you could

1370
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:33,840
have a couple of applications installed that have out-of-date libraries after a security

1371
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,840
issue.

1372
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,040
At the same time, that's a theoretical problem.

1373
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,960
I mean, it's a theoretical problem that's pretty easy to abstract from watching what

1374
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,360
could happen.

1375
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,920
But it is a theoretical problem.

1376
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,560
It also can go the other way, like subsonics problem, right?

1377
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,560
It wants newer libraries to be installed.

1378
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,560
Oh, yeah.

1379
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,560
That's very much.

1380
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,560
You're trying to install in 14.4.

1381
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,560
Yeah.

1382
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,560
If you start messing around with that stuff.

1383
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,560
Right.

1384
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,560
But you want your new app to have the shiny new on.

1385
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,560
Yeah.

1386
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,560
Super patched.

1387
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:04,280
The other thing is actually – what actually makes a system usually more secure is to avoid

1388
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:10,160
a monoculture and to have diversity and to have a lot of different obstacles in the way

1389
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,520
for an attacker.

1390
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,560
And so ironically, we've talked so much about having statically linked libraries could

1391
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,840
be a security issue.

1392
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,840
It's possible.

1393
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,360
This is just – I'm just putting this out there.

1394
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,920
But it's possible that having a whole bunch of random different versions of things on

1395
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:30,440
one system makes it very hard for an attacker to be able to set expectations and know what

1396
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,360
to be able to rely on exploiting in order to take advantage of a system.

1397
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:38,520
In other words, because these applications will all be using different versions of libraries,

1398
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,840
there may not be a common threat for an attacker to take advantage of.

1399
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:46,160
So diversity may actually end up being a security advantage.

1400
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,140
Just saying – I'm not saying theoretically that sounds sound, but in the way things seem

1401
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:54,880
to actually work out, one of the reasons why there's way less viruses for Linux – don't

1402
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,880
kid yourself.

1403
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,720
It's not because we have a small usage.

1404
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,760
Linux has a huge market share in servers.

1405
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,320
There's a ton of money in Linux malware.

1406
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:06,400
There's very few Linux malware, partially because we have a good security model, but

1407
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:12,220
also because we are fragmented as F. And it's very hard to write once and run anywhere on

1408
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:13,440
Linux right now.

1409
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,160
And that includes malware.

1410
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,360
That includes malware.

1411
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:22,320
And so if you continue to diversify in a weird way, you may be adding to security.

1412
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,320
I don't know.

1413
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,320
I could be wrong.

1414
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,320
But it might not be all –

1415
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,080
I'm going to package all my malware as SNAP packages thanks to you, Chris.

1416
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,080
Hey-o!

1417
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,080
Hey-o!

1418
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,080
And also submit it to the AUR while you're at it.

1419
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,880
Kitson, I wanted to give you a chance to jump in, though, because you had a point that

1420
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,880
I wanted you to ask.

1421
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,880
Yeah.

1422
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:42,720
I could actually see this being used to create a two-tiered system for package managing.

1423
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:47,480
Maybe you could have packages installed in your home directory somewhere.

1424
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:53,320
That way when you go to update your system and you want to do a full wipe on your system

1425
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:59,880
partition, you can keep those applications that you have installed on your home partition.

1426
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,320
I don't know if that's technically possible, but that's an interesting idea.

1427
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,320
Yeah.

1428
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:08,880
I've – Poppy, I'm glad you joined us because I just gave like a rough explanation

1429
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,880
of SNAP packages.

1430
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,520
I don't know if you've been listening.

1431
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,760
But if you want to correct me in any way, if you know any better, you feel free to jump

1432
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:15,760
in.

1433
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,760
I haven't been listening.

1434
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,760
I'm sorry.

1435
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,760
I was far too busy on the other podcast.

1436
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,760
Yeah.

1437
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,760
I know the time zone thing.

1438
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,760
The time zone thing.

1439
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,760
Yeah.

1440
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,760
Look at you.

1441
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,760
You're back-to-back podcasting right now, aren't you?

1442
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,760
I know, right?

1443
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,760
You're pro.

1444
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,760
You're pro.

1445
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,760
Never stop.

1446
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,620
We were just actually talking about SNAP packages, and this is actually something that I'm really

1447
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:36,880
glad you're here to answer because we talked about the dependencies and static link libraries,

1448
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:44,240
but one other thing, a kind of a con I've heard about SNAP packages is the backend can't

1449
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,240
be implemented on premises.

1450
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:53,520
The backend is run and controlled by Canonical, and there's not really an equivalent of having

1451
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,440
a local repository on your land.

1452
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,120
Is that – am I accurate?

1453
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,720
I'm not sure that's the case.

1454
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,240
That might be the case today because it isn't all finished yet.

1455
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:10,560
It's all like shifting sand underneath you at the moment, but I don't doubt that that

1456
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:14,320
will be the case in the future because I know there are plenty of people who want to implement

1457
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:20,520
SNAP on premises and don't necessarily want to have their systems calling outside to the

1458
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,520
internet.

1459
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,520
Sure.

1460
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,360
I mean, just look at providers like DigitalOcean who have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

1461
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,520
and hundreds of Ubuntu machines doing updates.

1462
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,520
For them, it makes a lot of sense.

1463
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:36,440
Also, one of the big selling points of SNAP is the secure side of it, and if you're a

1464
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:41,800
security-conscious organization where you want to make sure that there's no possibility

1465
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,560
for outside ingress to your network, then you want to make sure that all updates are

1466
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,360
delivered from inside your network.

1467
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,240
So I'm sure that's something that's on the radar.

1468
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:54,440
I've seen other people discuss it within Canonical, and at trade shows I've seen it

1469
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,680
being discussed, so I don't think it's dismissed as not happening.

1470
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,680
It's just not done yet.

1471
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,680
Sure.

1472
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,680
Sure.

1473
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,680
That makes sense.

1474
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,880
So if I was a betting man, Bobby, and I was asking for hints from you, when would I bet

1475
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,640
that I could install – when can I reliably expect to install SNAP packages?

1476
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,800
And am I using the right term?

1477
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,800
Is it a SNAP package?

1478
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,240
When I'm talking like instead of a DEB, is it a SNAP?

1479
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,240
Well, we tend to call it a SNAP.

1480
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,240
A SNAP.

1481
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,240
Oh, okay.

1482
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,240
So have you got a SNAP for that?

1483
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,240
Yeah.

1484
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,240
Yeah.

1485
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,240
Have you got a SNAP for that?

1486
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,240
That's good.

1487
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:28,240
So will there be a point where I'll be able to install them?

1488
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,240
You made that up.

1489
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,240
Wow.

1490
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,240
That's brilliant.

1491
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,240
I'm glad that came over.

1492
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,240
Get this man a raise.

1493
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,240
That is good.

1494
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,240
That is what's going to happen.

1495
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,240
That's what people will say.

1496
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,520
And so is the goal to have – is it going to be possible to install them in 16.04?

1497
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,520
Like I don't understand when that –

1498
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,520
Yep.

1499
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,520
Really?

1500
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,520
Oh.

1501
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,520
Yep.

1502
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,520
Well, you already – I mean, there's pre-release images now.

1503
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:51,160
I'm running SNAPy on my Raspberry Pi 2, which is on my desk in front of me.

1504
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:56,360
I've got the light blinking away at me as it's building stuff, but it's kind of – it's

1505
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,360
under development.

1506
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,360
It's shifting sand right now.

1507
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,480
It's really heavily under development.

1508
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,520
And so, you know, things can change.

1509
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,680
APIs can change, terminology changes, and so on.

1510
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:13,800
But once 16.04 is out, sometime soon after that, I would expect it to all stabilize,

1511
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:21,800
and you would get an LTS-style SNAPy image for your device, whatever device that is,

1512
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,760
and be able to install SNAP packages or indeed for the desktop as well.

1513
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,880
I remember the next – it seems like – not that that isn't enough of a challenge.

1514
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:36,000
But then the next really big milestone would be to get the developer community creating

1515
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
their own SNAPs.

1516
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,200
Are you – I mean, am I following?

1517
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,200
Does that seem like the next step?

1518
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,680
And that seems like a massive task.

1519
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,680
Yeah.

1520
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,920
And we're trying to – we're creating tools to make that easy.

1521
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:47,920
Like that is a target.

1522
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:53,080
That is a definitive target is to get developers creating SNAPs.

1523
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,840
And one of the tools that we have is called SNAPcraft.

1524
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,840
Oh, yeah.

1525
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,840
That's right.

1526
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:02,200
SNAPcraft just takes a single plain text YAML file, like – so for example, you can

1527
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:09,080
take a single plain text YAML file and bring together an application that is currently

1528
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,080
on GitHub.

1529
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:16,340
And you can bring like the tip of trunk on GitHub, and you can pull in whatever dependencies

1530
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,340
it needs.

1531
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,520
Maybe that application needs FFmpeg or AVConf or something like that.

1532
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:25,480
And so you can go and get the AVConf from the Debian Archive or the Ubuntu Archive.

1533
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:29,240
Or you can go and get – if you need Bleeding Edge, you can go and get that from GitHub

1534
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:34,200
or Bitbucket or wherever it comes from and pull all of these things together into an

1535
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:38,520
application and define all of that just in a single plain text YAML file.

1536
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,520
Right.

1537
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,520
And SNAPcraft.

1538
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,520
Right.

1539
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,480
And boom, it pushes out SNAP, which you then upload to the store.

1540
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,640
In fact, you can upload to the store directly from SNAPcraft.

1541
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:52,200
So you can just do SNAPcraft, SNAP, and it will create a SNAP, and then SNAPcraft upload,

1542
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,680
and boom, you're in the store.

1543
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,120
It's super easy.

1544
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,120
I love it.

1545
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:04,000
You know, when I first started playing with SNAPs, I was as skeptical as you and was fearful

1546
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,300
for change as you.

1547
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:10,440
And recently, I have been playing with it, and it is an amazingly good file.

1548
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,680
So the YAML file that describes the SNAP, what is that called?

1549
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:18,680
Because I watched Shuttleworth up on stage write one of those in probably 25 seconds.

1550
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:21,000
He'd probably written it 100 times, but...

1551
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It's a plain text file.

1552
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Yeah.

1553
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
What do you call that file, though?

1554
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
It's the...

1555
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
YAML?

1556
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Yeah.

1557
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
It's a SNAPcraft.yaml.

1558
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
It's got a predefined name, SNAPcraft.yaml.

1559
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Okay.

1560
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Okay.

1561
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
YAML.

1562
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Yeah.

1563
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
YAML.

1564
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
So...

1565
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
It's got a predefined format, and it's very easy to read.

1566
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Yeah.

1567
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,520
And in this file, you could say grab a file from GitHub or grab a file from FTP or grab

1568
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,760
a file from apt-colon-slash.

1569
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,760
Like, the source can...

1570
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:47,760
Okay.

1571
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,760
Where am I wrong?

1572
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:49,760
Well, yeah.

1573
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,760
But you're right.

1574
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,760
I mean, the syntax is different.

1575
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,760
But yeah, you say, go and get this from GitHub, go and get that from the archive.

1576
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:02,600
But you might say, like, for example, if you package up something simple like Calcet, right?

1577
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,920
Calcet is written in Perl, I think.

1578
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,880
So you'd need a certain number of Perl modules.

1579
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:11,280
You don't need all of Perl, and you don't need every Perl module.

1580
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,920
And in fact, the way that Debian and Ubuntu package things, they tend to bundle together

1581
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,120
a whole bunch of modules, but you don't need all of them.

1582
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:23,020
So why would you package all of that together in dependencies in your Calcet application?

1583
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:27,220
You would pull in Calcet and then the one or two modules that you need.

1584
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:32,240
So it's not just go and get this thing from GitHub, but go and get this thing from GitHub,

1585
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:37,280
go and get this Debian package, but only get these individual parts of that Debian package.

1586
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:41,080
You don't have to get the whole thing, and go and get these individual parts of another

1587
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,080
Debian package.

1588
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:47,720
So you can smush together all the bits that you would normally find inside, say, for example,

1589
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:51,760
a Windows executable, or what you'd find inside a Mac DMG file.

1590
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,280
There'd be loads of individual parts.

1591
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,920
We call them parts in the Snappy world.

1592
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:03,920
And those are brought together and built together to form one atomic unit, which is a snap.

1593
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,740
Has there been any talk about any other distributions letting this run?

1594
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:09,160
How easy would it be to port?

1595
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,160
Because I feel like that's where I'm really amazed.

1596
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,880
Dude, we barely have it running on Ubuntu, let alone someone else having it.

1597
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,840
But how standalone are they?

1598
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:17,840
Maybe it can work on Debian.

1599
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:18,840
They're all self-referenced.

1600
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,120
It seems like it could probably work on Debian.

1601
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,120
Right.

1602
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,120
So they are SquashFS files.

1603
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:31,840
So technically, a snap is a SquashFS file, which is mounted at a particular path in the

1604
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:32,840
file system.

1605
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:33,840
Okay.

1606
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:34,840
That's kind of similar to what AppImage was doing.

1607
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:35,840
Yeah.

1608
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,480
And there's two parts to it.

1609
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:41,000
There's the read-only part, which gives you the security that you know those files haven't

1610
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
been modified.

1611
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Right.

1612
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
And then there's a writable part.

1613
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:50,320
So every application needs a writable area, whether it's config or data or state or whatever

1614
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,320
it is.

1615
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,320
Yeah, exactly.

1616
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,600
And so a snap gives you both of those.

1617
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:00,040
And potentially, that could be installed on other distributions.

1618
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,080
Obviously, that's not our focus.

1619
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,080
Right.

1620
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,080
Right.

1621
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,720
We're totally focused on running on Ubuntu.

1622
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:09,800
I want to just, if we can – well, you know what?

1623
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,560
I want to do the big takeaway.

1624
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,240
But before then, I want Kitson to jump in.

1625
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,240
And then I'll jump in.

1626
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,720
Kitson, go ahead.

1627
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:23,440
So with what you're describing and everything, it does sound really complex to actually install

1628
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,920
the application as far as the behind-the-scenes stuff goes.

1629
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:30,800
So does this mean that the snap packages, will they remove themselves cleanly from a

1630
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,040
system and clean up their own depths and not configs?

1631
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,600
Oh, my God, yes.

1632
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,040
It's less complex, in fact.

1633
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:45,600
So one of the nice things about snaps is when you upgrade them, if anything goes wrong,

1634
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,320
they automatically roll back.

1635
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:50,160
And the same goes for the kernel and the OS.

1636
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,960
So in the event that you have –

1637
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:52,960
Whoa, whoa.

1638
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:53,960
The kernel's going to be a snap?

1639
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:54,960
Yep.

1640
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:55,960
The kernel's a snap.

1641
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:56,960
Not a deb.

1642
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:57,960
The OS is a snap.

1643
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:58,960
Well, where's the line drawn?

1644
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,660
No, in terms of desktop, is that true?

1645
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:01,660
Or is that you just talking –

1646
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:02,660
Oh, right.

1647
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:03,660
Okay.

1648
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:04,660
No.

1649
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:05,760
If you think about the Raspberry Pi running –

1650
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:06,760
Sure.

1651
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,760
Or the phone.

1652
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,760
Or the snappy – yeah, yeah.

1653
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,760
Or the phone.

1654
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,760
Then the kernel is a snap.

1655
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:11,760
The OS is a snap.

1656
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:19,320
On the desktop, right now, for 16.04, it's slightly blurry because you have a mixed mode.

1657
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:23,740
You've got the Debian world where you can still install Debs, but you've also got the

1658
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:25,960
ability to install snaps as well.

1659
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,760
You've got these two dimensions, as we call them.

1660
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:33,600
So in fact, this is where it gets – it fuzzes your brain a little bit.

1661
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:39,160
If you install on a Raspberry Pi a snappy install – so it's snappy out of the box

1662
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:46,740
– then you can have the classic dimension, which lets you install Debs, and conversely,

1663
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:52,240
if you've installed a Debian-based distro, like a desktop, there is the snappy dimension.

1664
01:06:52,240 --> 01:07:00,020
So on either side, you can install both, but they're kind of kept separate.

1665
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:06,880
So if this actually all gets pulled off and there are actual snaps available for things

1666
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,600
I care about, like say Sublime Text and Dropbox and Telegram and Chrome, which could take

1667
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,160
a year or so, but whatever.

1668
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,360
Let's just say it takes a while.

1669
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:22,560
What we are essentially now entering into the era of is an LTS that no longer holds

1670
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,820
you back from having modern applications.

1671
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:32,720
So where 14.04 – you could say the difficulty with 14.04 was it was always sort of tied

1672
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,920
down to an older version of GTK, which at this point in time now feels a little limiting.

1673
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,080
Certain things you just can't install, et cetera.

1674
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:47,240
But with 16.04, if snap packages actually take off and there are snaps, I could install

1675
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,720
an application like Corebird two years down the road now.

1676
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:55,640
So let's take like a hypothetical example, like exactly what you're saying.

1677
01:07:55,640 --> 01:08:02,360
Let's take 16.04 and 16.04 ships with, I don't know, LibreOffice 5.1 or whatever

1678
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,720
the latest version of LibreOffice is.

1679
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:08,180
Because it's an LTS, the support lasts for years.

1680
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:13,760
And then sometime during that support cycle, the Document Foundation release a new version

1681
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,760
of LibreOffice, which is like the kick-ass version of LibreOffice that has –

1682
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:23,200
High DPI, integrated support, online collaborative editing.

1683
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,200
Oh yeah, boom, go.

1684
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,200
All of that stuff.

1685
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,200
Yes.

1686
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,120
And more that you could not even think about.

1687
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,120
I want it now.

1688
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:33,200
Like we're talking AlphaGo levels of functionality.

1689
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,320
So imagine they did that, right?

1690
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:40,040
Typically we wouldn't put that back in the LTS release because we freeze the release

1691
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:44,460
and we only do bug updates and security updates.

1692
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:50,080
Imagine that there is a Snappy package in the store which is LibreOffice 6 or 7 or 8

1693
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:54,240
or whatever, which is bundled with whatever libraries are required to make that thing

1694
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,720
work on 16.04.

1695
01:08:55,720 --> 01:09:02,560
Now you could choose to stay on LibreOffice 5 or you could say I'll take LibreOffice

1696
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:07,600
6 or 7 because my business needs it or because I like the bleeding edge or I just want to

1697
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,640
try this stuff out and then undo it afterwards and roll it back afterwards.

1698
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:15,840
Because it's a self-contained SquashFS file, when you uninstall it, it's all gone away,

1699
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,600
including all the dependencies.

1700
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,600
That is going to be.

1701
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,960
And of course I know people listening are going to say, hey, there's a bunch of other

1702
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,560
people doing this.

1703
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,560
And I say, great.

1704
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,560
Totally.

1705
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,120
Which validates exactly what we're doing.

1706
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,440
Clearly we're not doing the wrong thing.

1707
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:32,960
And it's like a very common, it's like, okay, great now ship and let's see what works really

1708
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:33,960
well.

1709
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:34,960
I'm looking forward to that.

1710
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:35,960
Yeah.

1711
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:36,960
Wow.

1712
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:43,760
So maybe is it possible that there is something I can play around with for like my 16.04 review

1713
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,160
to talk about the process?

1714
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:49,680
Is there something out there already or am I going to, is it going to be like, you know,

1715
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:53,600
a down the road 16.04 kind of thing?

1716
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,600
What to install?

1717
01:09:54,600 --> 01:10:00,680
I would love to install a snap package for the first time on Linux action show during

1718
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,720
the 16.04 review.

1719
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:03,720
That'd be awesome.

1720
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,720
Yeah.

1721
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:05,720
You probably could.

1722
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:06,720
You probably could install it.

1723
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:09,400
You're not going to be able to install because it's early days, but there would be a small

1724
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:15,680
set that you could probably install fairly close to release, if not like soon before

1725
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,680
release.

1726
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,720
I think it's and then many more after.

1727
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:25,480
Well another idea for the developers, because one of the most as a developer side, the most

1728
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:31,120
annoying thing about Linux distribution is to get it in the repo with the snap packages.

1729
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:35,800
It seems like you just write a YAML script file or, you know, not script, but a YAML

1730
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:41,240
setup file and then you just submit it or build a package, submit it and you're done.

1731
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,440
And you're in control of that.

1732
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:46,600
So if you, if you want to push a new version to the store every day, if you want to push

1733
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:51,020
a new version, like yeah, a new version comes out twice a day and then there's a security

1734
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:54,920
update and then there's a bug fix cause you were having a bad day and you did a typo and

1735
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:59,360
sure enough you can shove another one in the store and your users will get another.

1736
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:03,520
And if you, and if you push an update that actually balks on client systems and it doesn't

1737
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,400
start anymore, then the client systems will roll them back for you.

1738
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,400
That's nice.

1739
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,400
That is nice.

1740
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,400
Wow.

1741
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,140
I am so, uh, the next segment, I'm going to, it's good.

1742
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:16,480
This actually sort of just builds on everything we just talked about in terms of 1604 I, I,

1743
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:20,400
before we go too much further here, I got to just disclaimer sitting in front of me.

1744
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:25,520
I do have an Ubuntu Mate 1510 machine, but that right there, that's mint over there.

1745
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,120
That's arch upstairs is arch.

1746
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,480
I mean, I'm still a multi distribution man.

1747
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:32,480
I love, I still love arch, but I gotta say,

1748
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:39,480
I have never been more excited about an Ubuntu release in, uh, I mean, I'm, I mean, I, I

1749
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,560
maybe since 1204, I don't know.

1750
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:46,240
I don't, I, this is genuinely looking like an incredible release.

1751
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:52,040
And a part of that is because, I mean, the snapback is just sounding awesome, but what's

1752
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:57,600
coming down the road, uh, I just had a conversation last night with Wimpy about some of the work

1753
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:04,040
he's done on Ubuntu Mate that's going to ship in 1604 to, to sort of bridge that gap between

1754
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:09,800
the traditional desktop environment and where the quote unquote modern Linux desktop is

1755
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:14,160
going and how do you not fall behind and have to become your own island.

1756
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:18,180
And that stuff is landing in 1604, so you take the snap packages, you take the long

1757
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:26,080
term support, you take the really great derivatives now, um, and ZFS.

1758
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:29,280
So anyways, uh, I'm going to, we're going to talk about, uh, the work that Wimpy did,

1759
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:33,200
but first I want to talk about Linux Academy, our sponsor right here on the Unplugged program,

1760
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,200
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

1761
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,280
In fact, live stream, would you all go there right now?

1762
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:40,520
Go there right now so that way they can see in their logs during the Unplugged show.

1763
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,520
They got a huge spike in traffic.

1764
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,520
Let's just do it.

1765
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,520
Let's see.

1766
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,600
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

1767
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,600
Go there right now.

1768
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,440
Learn more about the Linux Academy.

1769
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:53,520
It's a platform to learn the technologies built on top of Linux and of course the Linux

1770
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,600
fundamentals itself.

1771
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:58,560
Either that's in a nugget, a deep dive, two minutes to 60 minutes long, or it's through

1772
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:06,000
a comprehensive course with downloadables, great study guides, audio, video, live streams,

1773
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,940
all of that, 2,300 and what, 32 courses.

1774
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:12,940
Look at that.

1775
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:14,820
Instructor help is available when you need it.

1776
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:15,820
That's really nice too.

1777
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:16,820
They have a great system.

1778
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:19,880
You can go in there and you can tell it how much time you have available in a week.

1779
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,960
I have time on a Tuesday.

1780
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,800
I have time on a Thursday.

1781
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,660
And then of course after the Linux action show, I'm going to do a little bit of study

1782
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:27,160
and so I got some time on Sunday.

1783
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,280
Well, guess what?

1784
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,320
You tell it that, you plug that into the system, it automatically generates courseware for

1785
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,400
you that matches that availability.

1786
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,320
They also have other systems that are great for those of us that are time crunched and

1787
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:40,720
when you want to go deep, so many great courses on that.

1788
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,740
I think their scenario-based labs are pretty unique.

1789
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:47,520
Those are really cool labs that put you in the middle of tasks common to everyday environments

1790
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,440
so you really get a sense of working out in the field.

1791
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:54,200
You can work in their advanced lab environments completing the task from beginning to end.

1792
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:57,080
It's an entire scenario that you might find in the working environment.

1793
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,080
It's the real deal.

1794
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,840
It is nice and the thing about it is they have seven plus distributions to choose from

1795
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:06,040
so it automatically adjusts the virtual machine and the courseware to match that distribution

1796
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:10,240
and then they've got graded server exercises which I think is really cool.

1797
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:14,120
They automatically grade your actions so you can see how well you did which is really nice

1798
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,120
and they have systems in there.

1799
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:20,640
If you've got a little bit of anxiety, not to mention the community is stacked full of

1800
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,040
Jupyter Broadcasting members and they're adding content.

1801
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,120
They're working on an Android app.

1802
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,800
They've got an iOS app now.

1803
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:27,960
They're updating all the time.

1804
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,560
They've just moved to new offices with new staff.

1805
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:34,040
They're expanding like crazy and they're doubling down on the content but what I think is really

1806
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:43,920
nice is they're hiring dedicated staff to make sure the back catalogue of content, huh,

1807
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:48,080
the back catalogue – that's harder to say – try saying that, Wes, the back catalogue

1808
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,080
of content.

1809
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,080
Try that.

1810
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,080
I'm not sure you said bat catalogue.

1811
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,080
Yeah.

1812
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,080
Try saying the back catalogue of content.

1813
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,080
Go ahead.

1814
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,080
Try it.

1815
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,080
Back catalogue of – it's hard.

1816
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,080
Try it.

1817
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,080
Back catalogue of content.

1818
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,880
You had to slow down.

1819
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:00,880
Try it.

1820
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:01,880
Say it fast, Wes.

1821
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:02,880
Say it fast.

1822
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:03,880
Back catalogue of content.

1823
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:04,880
Say it one more time.

1824
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:05,880
Back catalogue of content.

1825
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:06,880
That's really hard.

1826
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:07,880
Damn you, Chris.

1827
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:11,360
So they've got dedicated personnel now, dedicated – because they're dedicated, Wes.

1828
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,360
I don't know if you knew this.

1829
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:13,360
They're very dedicated.

1830
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:17,160
They're dedicated to that back catalogue of content over at Linux Academy, which I

1831
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,440
think is just a brilliant move.

1832
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,440
Great in-depth resources.

1833
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:21,440
Go check them out.

1834
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,440
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1835
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,280
It's a great fit for you guys.

1836
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,280
And they're a great sponsor.

1837
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:29,200
Thank you, Linux Academy, for sponsoring the unplugged program, LinuxAcademy.com slash

1838
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,200
unplugged.

1839
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,200
Unplugged.

1840
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,240
And keep that catalogue shining, Linux Academy.

1841
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,720
Keep that catalogue shining.

1842
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:40,840
So this is literally how the conversation goes last – I think it was last night because

1843
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:47,480
Wimpy knows that we've been following the client-side decoration thing on Gnome and

1844
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:51,640
the whole debate between client-side and server-side decoration implementations and all of that.

1845
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,480
We've followed it since the beginning, really.

1846
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:57,840
So we're talking back and forth and he says, well, tomorrow I'm going to write up this

1847
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,760
post about this work I did in Ubuntu Mate.

1848
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,520
And then about 30 minutes go by and he links me to the post that he'd written because

1849
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,680
he's so excited about it.

1850
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,000
He's had to get it out there, I think.

1851
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,760
So I don't even want to take it from you, Wimpy.

1852
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:09,760
I don't want to steal it.

1853
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:14,480
But give us an update about some of the work that you did to implement client-side decorations

1854
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:18,000
and header bar applications in Ubuntu Mate, which will be shipping in 16.04.

1855
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,520
Can you tell us a little bit about some of that work you did and why?

1856
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,740
I can.

1857
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:31,560
So although I've done some things, I've not done anything particularly new.

1858
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:39,040
So there's a hat tip here to Wolfgang Albrecht, who is the Mate developer who maintains the

1859
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,000
Mate themes.

1860
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,920
And he worked out a lot of this stuff.

1861
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:50,640
And I borrowed from the work that he's done in order to do this.

1862
01:16:50,640 --> 01:17:00,560
But what this gives us is that the default themes in Ubuntu Mate now support client-side

1863
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:04,960
decorated applications and those applications with header bars.

1864
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:10,760
And although they have run in the past, they obviously execute, they didn't render correctly.

1865
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:17,400
So they didn't have the shadowing effects, and the popovers didn't render correctly,

1866
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,640
and a whole raft of just little annoyances.

1867
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:25,840
And it's one of those things that when you're using the computer, and I'm using it day after

1868
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:31,280
day, and you want some of those newer applications that are using client-side decorations and

1869
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:37,560
header bar, my favorite at the moment is Corebird, which is hands down the best Twitter client

1870
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,560
for desktop Linux.

1871
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,800
I agree.

1872
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:46,520
But looked like complete arse, and it wasn't, you know, Ubuntu Mate wasn't doing justice

1873
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,520
to this application.

1874
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,000
How do I install it right now?

1875
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,880
Could I install it in the repo right now so I can show people?

1876
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,200
Because I'm on the older version.

1877
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,120
I'll tell you what, I'll log in.

1878
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,120
Is it not easy?

1879
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:57,840
Okay, if it's not easy, it's okay.

1880
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,200
If it was in the software boutique, for example, I would just go ahead and do it.

1881
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:07,560
Yeah, it's not easy because it's part of the artwork package, which also includes the Plymouth

1882
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:13,440
themes, and the structure of the Plymouth stuff has changed in 16.04 and isn't backwards

1883
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,440
compatible.

1884
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,400
What is the version of GTK in 16.04?

1885
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,040
I think it's 3.18, I think.

1886
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,040
Yeah, I think that sounds right.

1887
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:23,560
I think that's what I remember reading too.

1888
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:28,120
So Wimpy, one of the first things when you implemented this, and by the way, it genuinely

1889
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,120
looks good.

1890
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:33,280
One of the things I like about the screenshot is you mixed in traditional title bar applications

1891
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,900
and client-side decoration.

1892
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:36,920
It's very consistent.

1893
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:40,640
It took, I think, three or four comments before people are like, why would you do this?

1894
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:41,840
This is an atrocity.

1895
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,080
Client-side decoration should burn.

1896
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:49,400
I looked back, Wimpy, we've had comments about this, about client-side decoration since 2013.

1897
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,460
The drama doesn't seem to be going away.

1898
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:57,840
Why would the bastion of the traditional desktop, where I go to avoid the atrocity that is Unity,

1899
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,880
why would that implement client-side decoration?

1900
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:00,880
Hang on.

1901
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:01,880
I was just channeling.

1902
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:02,880
I was just channeling.

1903
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:03,880
Cool.

1904
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:04,880
Peter, you've got something to say.

1905
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:05,880
I can tell.

1906
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:06,880
No, no, no.

1907
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:07,880
Carry on.

1908
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:08,880
Okay.

1909
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:16,040
So it's very, very simple.

1910
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:21,680
You can't hide from the fact that there are client-side decorated applications and applications

1911
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,760
using header bars.

1912
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,280
And there are not a huge number of them, but those numbers are growing.

1913
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:33,200
And certainly some of the new applications that are coming along from the GNOME desktop

1914
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:37,440
are compelling and use this design paradigm.

1915
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:43,420
And to simply cut yourself off from being able to use those applications would be extremely

1916
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:50,280
short-sighted for an LTS release and thinking about how those applications are going to

1917
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:54,680
develop and probably become more prominent over the next five years.

1918
01:19:54,680 --> 01:20:00,880
So I wanted to get the support in so that people that are using Ubuntu MATE can have

1919
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:06,320
their traditional applications and we like that stuff and that's great.

1920
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:12,080
If there are one or two client-side decorated applications that are clearly best in class

1921
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:16,360
and hands down, the best one that you want.

1922
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:20,360
You don't want it to look rubbish and you want it to work properly and blend with the

1923
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:21,360
rest of the desktop.

1924
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,360
Yeah.

1925
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,960
You don't want a penalty for choosing a different desktop environment.

1926
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:25,960
No.

1927
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:26,960
Yeah.

1928
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:27,960
No.

1929
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:32,260
So Michael Dominic, co-host Coderadio, probably the second mention in this episode, he switched

1930
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:35,240
to Ubuntu recently when his MacBook died on him.

1931
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:40,820
And he's been running 14.04 and one of the applications he tried to install was Corbird.

1932
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:43,080
But it's not been going well for him.

1933
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:47,560
So your insight about needing to have this well supported on an LTS I think is a good

1934
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:51,180
one because he's not willing to run anything but an LTS.

1935
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:56,840
So he's just sort of stuck in this limbo right now and it looks really well done.

1936
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:59,560
Kitson, I wanted to give you a chance to jump in though because you had something you wanted

1937
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,560
to mention.

1938
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,560
Go ahead.

1939
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:04,760
I think Kitson went to get some popcorn.

1940
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:05,760
I think he's good.

1941
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:06,760
He's good.

1942
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:07,760
He's good.

1943
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:12,000
Well, I did find it interesting that people were jumping on the bandwagon saying, by you

1944
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:18,520
supporting client-side decorations here, you're going to help encourage more application development

1945
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:19,520
like that.

1946
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,520
Which I –

1947
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:27,640
Well, the thing is that GNOME is kind of this unstoppable force.

1948
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:35,520
So you can't just pretend that GNOME is not out there iterating on their desktop and their

1949
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:41,480
applications every six months and that this is the design direction that they're going

1950
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,480
in.

1951
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,800
That's simply crazy.

1952
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:50,040
Well, and I think also – and I don't know, it's not just that wimpy.

1953
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:53,200
Isn't it also Mere and Weyland?

1954
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:59,120
Well, to some extent and I'll cross that bridge in the future.

1955
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,120
That's –

1956
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:07,460
I guess if my understanding is correct though, GNOME's plan for supporting Weyland is essentially

1957
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:14,920
– their continued effort is behind client-side decorated apps and that's sort of going

1958
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:19,360
to be the future direction for Weyland-supported GNOME applications, am I – right?

1959
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:24,280
So in order for Mate desktop to even begin down the path of Weyland or Mere support,

1960
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:30,000
which your parent distribution is switching to, you have to go this route, don't you?

1961
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Eventually?

1962
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,080
To some extent, yes.

1963
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:37,920
And even if it's eventually, even if it's in another two years for the next LTS, isn't

1964
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:42,680
it sensible just to do it now and learn that?

1965
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:46,160
And this isn't stuff that other people haven't done before.

1966
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:52,560
I think that Ubuntu have got this to some extent as well and some of the other desktop

1967
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,680
environments.

1968
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:59,280
But this was new to Ubuntu Mate and I was very pleased with the results because I've

1969
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:08,840
had about a week of some spare time with my computer and we've got ahead of the schedule

1970
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:13,880
for the 16.04 release, so we've got an extended period of being able to do some bug fixing

1971
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,400
and refinements.

1972
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:19,520
And there's been a few things about the themes and the look and feel that I've really never

1973
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:24,420
been happy with, but there's always been something more important needed dealing with.

1974
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:29,640
So actually having the time to sit down and sort of smooth some of those rough edges.

1975
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:35,240
And then I look back at this, you know, several evenings work and I'd got one computer that

1976
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:38,080
was running that last week's image.

1977
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:42,320
And then this one I'd been working on, I thought, you know what, I really feel like we've nailed

1978
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,320
this.

1979
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:46,800
This is such an improvement because there's there's tweaks and improvements across the

1980
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:55,560
theming across the board and with the Qt4 and Qt5 integration that is activated by default.

1981
01:23:55,560 --> 01:24:00,920
So those are facilities that exist within Qt4 and Qt5 that you have to hook into.

1982
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,680
But all of that is baked into Ubuntu.

1983
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:06,320
And just to sort of just sort of break that down, what you're saying is you've enabled

1984
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:11,960
the support for Qt applications to sort of integrate and adopt the look of the GTK application.

1985
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:15,000
So they should look at place on the Mate desktop.

1986
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Yeah.

1987
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:23,320
And those applications that don't define a very specific style will look like a GTK application.

1988
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:28,960
So the Qt apps will look like GTK applications where that's not the case is something like

1989
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,940
the official telegram desktop client.

1990
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:36,320
They've got a very specific style that they've kind of hard coded into the application.

1991
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:40,120
They have linked to their own version of Qt and all that kind of stuff.

1992
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,120
Yeah.

1993
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,120
Yeah.

1994
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,520
This is pretty cool.

1995
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:49,600
And I think this combined with the software boutique will also be in 16.04, right?

1996
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,600
Yeah.

1997
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,560
And Corebird is in the software boutique.

1998
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:53,560
Yeah.

1999
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,760
That software, literally wimpy, I'm not kidding.

2000
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:02,600
That software boutique is what kept me on the Apollo running 15.10.

2001
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,880
Because when you gave me the PPA for that, all of the extra stuff that I was wanting

2002
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:09,720
from the AUR was in the boutique and I just went through and installed it all in a few

2003
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:10,720
minutes and then, OK.

2004
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:11,720
Well, now I'm good.

2005
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:12,720
I don't need to go anywhere.

2006
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:17,920
But now, now I'm actually considering switching my Arch desktops over to Mate for a little

2007
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:18,920
while.

2008
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:19,920
Whoa.

2009
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:20,920
Yeah.

2010
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:21,920
I know.

2011
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:22,920
We'll see where it goes.

2012
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:23,920
Crikey.

2013
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:24,920
I know.

2014
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:25,920
You'll have to do a lot of heavy lifting for yourself because...

2015
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:26,920
I know.

2016
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:27,920
That is legitimately true.

2017
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:28,920
And that's why I'm hoping Snap packages.

2018
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:31,160
That's why I'm hoping Snap packages.

2019
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:34,760
I want Snaps for everything and then I'm back on Ubuntu, everybody.

2020
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:35,760
What's up?

2021
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:36,760
Oh, we'll see.

2022
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:37,760
I was actually...

2023
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,760
Full circle.

2024
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,440
I was targeting for Fedora as my next landing spot.

2025
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:44,120
But you take this, you take the stuff that Wimpy is doing here, I just love it, and then

2026
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:45,800
you combine that with Snap packages.

2027
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,800
That's a hard, hard thing.

2028
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,280
You know, it's going to drive me to...

2029
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:49,280
Yeah, go ahead.

2030
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:55,400
I was just going to say, just to sort of close out, I started by mentioning Wolfgang Albrecht

2031
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:58,240
and then I've reused his work.

2032
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:04,600
I've updated the default themes in Ubuntu Mate, so that's Ambient Mate and Radiant Mate.

2033
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:10,760
But all of the official Mate themes also have all of this support built in.

2034
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:18,400
So the full theme suite is all CSD header bar enabled.

2035
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:22,800
So it's not just one theme, it's everything that comes.

2036
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,800
It is...

2037
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:28,240
The next couple of years are going to be really something.

2038
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:30,440
There is really a lot of, you know...

2039
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:36,400
And wouldn't it be great in this time if Copper on Fedora got even better, and the build service

2040
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:40,640
had more and more vendors that were just using the build service, and Snap packages had more

2041
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:44,960
and more people creating Snap packages, and the AUR continues to just be the best thing

2042
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,240
out there ever.

2043
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,240
Wouldn't that just...

2044
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,560
I mean, wow!

2045
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:50,560
It's so funny.

2046
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,680
Depending on your perspective on where you sit, software is either the hardest thing

2047
01:26:54,680 --> 01:27:01,240
to ever do on Linux, and deploy and install, or it is about to be the coolest it has ever

2048
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,400
been ever.

2049
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:06,480
It just depends on your perspective at this point, and if you're a power user who might

2050
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:12,820
be buying that Dell Sputnik because you're a developer, then to you, this is awesome.

2051
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:15,640
And if you're a regular user, you just got to wait it out a little while, and all this

2052
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:17,280
stuff will eventually get smoothed out.

2053
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,320
That is pretty freaking cool.

2054
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:23,600
Well, in mumble room, anything else before we wrap up on today's episode, because I'm

2055
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:28,440
ready to go get myself some 16.04, I'm ready to go install some Ubuntu Mate on my arches.

2056
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:29,440
Get some snaps!

2057
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,680
It's going to be a mess up in this place.

2058
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:32,680
And you know what?

2059
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:33,680
Yeah.

2060
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:34,680
Yeah, go ahead.

2061
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:38,720
I wanted to say earlier before my system decided to do what it did.

2062
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:41,960
When you went AFK, we need away from Mike.

2063
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:42,960
You went AFM.

2064
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:43,960
AFM.

2065
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:44,960
Yeah.

2066
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:45,960
AFM, bro.

2067
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:46,960
Yeah.

2068
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,240
Well, what happened was this push to talk stopped working on me temporarily, so I had

2069
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:51,160
to log out and log back in.

2070
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,160
I forgive you.

2071
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,160
Go ahead.

2072
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:58,080
But yeah, I think supporting the client-side decorations in Mate is extremely important

2073
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:02,000
because it's part of the concept of just working.

2074
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,160
And if an application doesn't just work, then people aren't going to use it.

2075
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:10,720
And then the other part of that is if this is a new person coming to Linux, suddenly

2076
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:15,040
that desktop is a desktop that doesn't work for them, and they're not going to recommend

2077
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,600
it to anybody else.

2078
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:21,680
So I think it is crucial that these kinds of standards are implemented and supported

2079
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:24,880
correctly in other desktops.

2080
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:25,880
Hmm.

2081
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:26,880
Good point.

2082
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,880
And you know what?

2083
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:35,120
I just realized that if I switch away from GNOME 3 because I like Ubuntu Mate's implementation

2084
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:41,080
of the desktop, I'm literally stepping away from the beast that is GNOME and then becoming

2085
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:44,600
dependent on Wimpy's brand of implementation.

2086
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,600
That is a scary...

2087
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:46,600
That is a scary...

2088
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:47,600
They all have all the power.

2089
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,600
Oh, my goodness.

2090
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:49,600
Oh, my goodness.

2091
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,480
Well, Cotton Rotten, you wanted to mention something.

2092
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,480
Go ahead.

2093
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:54,480
Oh, about extensions.

2094
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,480
Yeah.

2095
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,480
Oh, yeah.

2096
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:01,400
I just wrote a solution for a problem that I had and a lot of people had.

2097
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,120
In general, there's a preview for it.

2098
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:06,000
That's what it looks like without the extension.

2099
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,600
And this is what it looks like with it.

2100
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:11,480
Well, describe it for the audio audience, too.

2101
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:12,480
It's a...

2102
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:17,820
Essentially, what it does is take the GNOME extensions website and provides download buttons

2103
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:18,820
for the actual extensions.

2104
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:19,820
Oh, cool.

2105
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:20,820
So you can install them directly.

2106
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:21,820
I see.

2107
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:22,820
Yeah.

2108
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:24,800
So it's a little cut off on the live stream, but...

2109
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,280
And then I guess that'd be...

2110
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:29,280
So that way, when you reload, you can add them back really quickly, I guess?

2111
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,280
Yeah.

2112
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,900
You can add them back with the tweak tool and you can also pick which version you want

2113
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:35,160
in case you don't have...

2114
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,120
It's not detecting the right version, things like that.

2115
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,120
Nice.

2116
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:41,320
And it also supports Chromium and basically everything.

2117
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:43,120
Oh, that's definitely nice.

2118
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:47,360
Yeah, because you got to use a browser that has the Netscape plugin API in order to use

2119
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:48,360
that.

2120
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,360
Yeah.

2121
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:50,360
So it just bypasses it completely.

2122
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:52,960
I'm not sure it's the best way to go, but for you Arch users, oftentimes, almost all

2123
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:56,920
those GNOME extensions are in the AUR, too, and then the package manager updates them.

2124
01:29:56,920 --> 01:30:03,640
While developing it, I talked to one of the GNOME developers and he said that in 3.22,

2125
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:06,560
he's expecting to have GNOME software support for extensions.

2126
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,560
Oh.

2127
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:11,440
And as we wrap up, we should mention, too, that I think OMG Ubuntu has an article about

2128
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:18,320
Canonical looking for a hand on getting their implementation of GNOME software up to schnuff

2129
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,560
because the icons and stuff are broken.

2130
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,480
So you guys, if you are interested in that, you can go check that out.

2131
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:26,120
Hey, but you know what, Wes?

2132
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,760
It's a great sound effect.

2133
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:33,760
That brings us to the end of this week's episode of the Unplugged program, 1.36, in the bag,

2134
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:34,760
in the can.

2135
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:36,880
Man, Linux Fest is coming up so soon.

2136
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:37,880
I'm excited.

2137
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:38,880
Yeah.

2138
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,600
At some point, we're going to have people in the studio.

2139
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,240
I mean, what are we going to do with them?

2140
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:44,240
I don't know.

2141
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:45,240
Just join us for the shenanigans over at jblive.tv.

2142
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:46,240
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com.

2143
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:50,720
Get it converted to your local time zone and submit content to the show by going to linuxactionshow.reddit.com

2144
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:51,720
and go to jupitabroadcasting.com.

2145
01:30:51,720 --> 01:31:18,680
Contact to send us an email, and we'll see you right back here next week.

2146
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:39,800
We should give a total shout out to both Popeye and Wimpy, pro broadcasters.

2147
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:44,840
If you ever watch a radio DJ live stream, you get kind of weirded out, at least I did.

2148
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:50,840
The first couple of times I watched Adam Carolla or our local DJs here on Cairo do radio, the

2149
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:56,480
music's playing, and the music's right about to hit, and as the music's hitting the intro,

2150
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:59,440
they sit down and go, ah, welcome to blah, blah, blah, blah, and it's like, they were

2151
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:04,240
just outside in the room three seconds ago, and then they sat down and just started talking

2152
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:05,920
like they'd been there the whole time.

2153
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,000
That's what Popeye and Wimpy did this week, because the time zone changed.

2154
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:15,040
They're recording the Ubuntu podcast, and then they slip into the mumble room, and some

2155
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,680
quick maneuvering on our part.

2156
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:21,280
We bumped the client-side decorations at the end of the show, and we realized daylight

2157
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,280
savings.

2158
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,280
You're giving away our secrets.

2159
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:26,240
I know, but it all worked out pretty well in the end, so thank you guys for making that

2160
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,240
work.

2161
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,240
Yes, thank you.

2162
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,240
We appreciate it.

2163
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:30,240
That was good fun.

2164
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,240
You're welcome.

2165
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:32,240
I had no idea what the hell you said before we arrived about Snappy.

2166
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:36,640
You could have said it was just on the biggest pile of dog shit before I came in.

2167
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:38,120
Ironically, no, I think if you listen back to the whole-

2168
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:40,160
And then I come in and go, yeah, I completely agree.

2169
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:44,940
I think if you listen back to the whole episode, it all flows really well, because it all sort

2170
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:48,880
of went together, so that was pretty funny.

2171
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,880
Firewatch is loading.

2172
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:51,880
Here we go, Wes.

2173
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:52,880
I'm excited.

2174
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:57,920
Ooh, we get a little intro video.

2175
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,600
All right, bring it.

2176
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:03,440
Now the mouse cursor's in the video.

2177
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:04,440
Panic Incorporated.

2178
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:11,100
Hey, Panic, sure, okay, I know Panic.

2179
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:13,840
You old hat, you.

2180
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,800
Boulder, Colorado, 1975, Wes.

2181
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:21,800
Get ready.

2182
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:30,120
Uh, I don't see anything right now.

2183
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:33,760
All I see is this, oh, okay, I'm supposed to do something.

2184
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,480
Here we go.

2185
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:40,280
She's about your age, late 20s, laughing with well-dressed professors and grad students

2186
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:42,520
from a nearby CU, Boulder.

2187
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:46,040
You, Henry, are out drinking with your pals.

2188
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:47,040
You approach her.

2189
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,240
Bold move, Chris.

2190
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,840
You are drunk.

2191
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:53,800
So what's your, you know, major?

2192
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:54,800
You?

2193
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:55,800
You're pretty.

2194
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:56,800
Which one do you want to go with?

2195
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:57,800
I like that one.

2196
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:58,800
I like that one.

2197
01:33:58,800 --> 01:33:59,800
I do too, I like that one.

2198
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:00,800
It's sincere.

2199
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:01,800
Are you guys playing Leisure Suit, Larry?

2200
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:03,080
No, we're playing Firewatch.

2201
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:05,520
You're pretty, she says coolly.

2202
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:06,520
You are not.

2203
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:08,160
You are a future hangover.

2204
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:09,160
Wow.

2205
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:10,160
What?

2206
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:11,160
You reply confused.

2207
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:12,160
Someone should buy you a cheeseburger, she says.

2208
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:16,000
You flake down a waiter, and one week later, you are Julia's boyfriend.

2209
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Nice move.

2210
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Thank you, sir.

2211
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Thank you.

2212
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:30,000
All right, so now we're in an elevator, sort of an emo elevator with a really low frame

2213
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,680
rate.

2214
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,680
So I can click on objects.

2215
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:33,680
I'm going to pick up this backpack.

2216
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:34,680
Hey, look at that.

2217
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:35,680
I got a backpack.

2218
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:36,680
Wes.

2219
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:37,680
Why are you so critical of this elevator?

2220
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:38,680
Well, look at the frame rate.

2221
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:42,920
I mean, I know this thing's just Intel Graphics and it's doing mirroring, but, oh, what do

2222
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:43,920
we got here?

2223
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:44,920
Okay.

2224
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:46,920
Let's walk forward.

2225
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:47,920
Huh.

2226
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:51,000
The music is great.

2227
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,160
So I'm in a parking garage.

2228
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,760
Do they sell just the music?

2229
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:54,760
Yes, they do, actually.

2230
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:55,760
Oh, wow.

2231
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:56,760
Great.

2232
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:57,760
Yeah.

2233
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:58,760
They do have that on Steam.

2234
01:34:58,760 --> 01:34:59,760
Well, I'm going to buy both, I guess.

2235
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:00,760
It's pretty cool.

2236
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:01,760
All right.

2237
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:02,760
So this is a pretty hip little truck.

2238
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:03,760
Let's see if I can get in.

2239
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,240
Oh, I happen to have the keys.

2240
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:08,880
It does seem to match your bag.

2241
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:09,880
All right.

2242
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:13,640
I'm in the truck now.

2243
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,920
You date for over a year.

2244
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:17,760
She drives you absolutely nuts.

2245
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,760
It's great.

2246
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:24,640
Aw, cute.

2247
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:25,640
You move in.

2248
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:29,240
You share an apartment near the school with a view of the mountains.

2249
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:31,040
You two drink beer out on the deck.

2250
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,480
Here, cheers, Wes.

2251
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,960
You drink beer just about anywhere.

2252
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:35,960
That's great.

2253
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:39,080
Life is good.

2254
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:40,080
Julia wants to get a dog.

2255
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,080
Oh, do it.

2256
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,720
Dogs are great.

2257
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:44,920
There's a scruffy undersized beagle Julia's in love.

2258
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:45,920
She wants to bring it home.

2259
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:48,840
She wants to bring it with her to class.

2260
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:51,280
She's also an intimidating but gentle.

2261
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:54,680
There's also an intimidating but gentle German shepherd.

2262
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,760
Nothing bad could happen to Julia while walking this dog.

2263
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:57,760
It's badass.

2264
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:00,760
Let's go with the G. I don't know.

2265
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:03,760
What do you think?

2266
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:09,000
I feel like if Julia got the dog that she can bring to class, it would be an expression

2267
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,240
of your love out in public.

2268
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:12,240
Yeah, true.

2269
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:15,520
So then she would be able to brag about you, like, oh yes, my boyfriend got me this dog.

2270
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,280
As long as she's the one feeding the dog.

2271
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,800
And the thing is, beagles are barkers.

2272
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:19,800
They sure are.

2273
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:20,800
They're going to bark.

2274
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:21,800
So I'm going to say beagle.

2275
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:22,800
What do you say?

2276
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:23,800
All right, do it.

2277
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:24,800
We name him Bucket.

2278
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:28,120
Bucket's a good dog, and a week later, you've totally forgotten about the other one.

2279
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:29,920
Julia loves him.

2280
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:30,920
You love him too.

2281
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:32,960
Does it feel like they're manipulating us?

2282
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:33,960
Yeah.

2283
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:40,040
1979, you talk out on the deck, it's summer, 9.30 PM, and the heat still radiates off the

2284
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,040
high desert.

2285
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,520
What do you think about kids?

2286
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:43,520
She asks.

2287
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,520
Oh boy, Wes.

2288
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:45,520
Getting serious.

2289
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:46,520
Kids?

2290
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:48,660
They're not very smart, or good at much.

2291
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:54,360
I'm saying if you and I had some, a couple of little idiots.

2292
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:55,600
I think we should just say yes.

2293
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:56,600
All right, do it.

2294
01:36:56,600 --> 01:37:00,080
I mean, when this question comes up, she's been thinking about that for a long time.

2295
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,920
You've got to be careful how you answer this one, Wes.

2296
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:03,920
Heads up.

2297
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:04,920
You're a man with experience.

2298
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:05,920
In that case, we should probably get married.

2299
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:06,920
Yeah?

2300
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:07,920
I would like that, you say.

2301
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,620
These kids are going to be screwed up enough.

2302
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:12,440
It's probably the best that their parents are hitched.

2303
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:13,960
You say she's absolutely right.

2304
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:15,720
This game moves fast.

2305
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:16,720
Yeah, man.

2306
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:19,240
It's a modern game.

2307
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:22,720
Now you're getting in your super cool... Wait, no, we just got out of our super cool truck.

2308
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:24,480
I missed the truck.

2309
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:27,000
Looks like we're out for a hike.

2310
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,200
Let's go take a little walksies.

2311
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:31,640
Thorough fire trial head.

2312
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:32,640
We're all here.

2313
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:34,480
Don't forget to check in.

2314
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:38,080
Warning, thoroughfare trail is not recommended for the inexperienced hikers.

2315
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:39,560
Don't bring fireworks.

2316
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:40,560
Huh.

2317
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:44,640
This is a pretty gorgeous game, even with the graphics settings turned down to work

2318
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:45,640
on the Intel graphics.

2319
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:46,640
Yeah.

2320
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:51,560
How do you check in, Wes?

2321
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:53,560
Interesting.

2322
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:56,200
Boy, look at this.

2323
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:59,660
This is something I think I'm going to play later after the show.

2324
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:02,520
This is where I miss the Bonobo right now.

2325
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,000
Bonobo will be able to chew on this.

2326
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Yeah.

2327
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,160
This is part of cool... I didn't check in, so if you see where I'm supposed to check

2328
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:10,160
in, you let me know.

2329
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:11,160
I sure will.

2330
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:12,160
Uh-oh.

2331
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:14,000
We got a little crossfade happening.

2332
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Stand by one.

2333
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Oh, she is.

2334
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
1980.

2335
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,880
It's Thursday night, and Julia is four hours late.

2336
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:20,880
She doesn't call.

2337
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,760
You're worried and getting angrier by the minute.

2338
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:23,760
Whoa.

2339
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:24,760
We got to temper, don't we, Chris?

2340
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:25,760
She walks in after you've gone to bed.

2341
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:26,760
But not really.

2342
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:27,760
I'm up.

2343
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:28,760
Just pretending to be asleep.

2344
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:31,240
She's not quite drunk, but she's clearly been having a fun time.

2345
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:34,480
You fight when she gets between the sheets.

2346
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:36,680
You fight when she gets between the sheets.

2347
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:38,720
Do you get mad, or do you ignore her?

2348
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:41,240
You want to press her?

2349
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:42,720
For convenience of time, I say we press her.

2350
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:43,720
Yes, press her.

2351
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:44,720
Let's get mad.

2352
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,200
I mean, Pacific Northwest-wise, we should probably pick the acid.

2353
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:47,880
You call her an inconsiderate asshole.

2354
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,320
I don't think I would have done that.

2355
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:50,320
No.

2356
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:53,560
She tells you to eff off yourself and not to be such a baby.

2357
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:55,600
You call her selfish.

2358
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,560
She knows you mean it, and it hurts her feelings.

2359
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:58,560
Ouch.

2360
01:38:58,560 --> 01:38:59,560
That was the wrong call.

2361
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:01,160
This is an emotional game.

2362
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:02,160
I did not mean to do that.

2363
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:03,160
No.

2364
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:04,160
Julie still likes to draw.

2365
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:05,160
She draws plants from her research.

2366
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:06,160
She draws all the places you go.

2367
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:07,160
She draws you.

2368
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:09,040
You pose and flex like a he-man.

2369
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:12,000
You frolic like Victoria's Secret Model.

2370
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Let's go with the Secret Model thing.

2371
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Yeah, definitely.

2372
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,120
It would be funny.

2373
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:16,120
She was right.

2374
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:20,080
You are very pretty.

2375
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:24,120
Okay.

2376
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:27,080
Now we're hiking again.

2377
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:28,560
It's like we're thinking of this while we're hiking.

2378
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,560
It's red out.

2379
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:30,560
You see how...

2380
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:31,560
Yeah.

2381
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:33,880
No instruction of where I'm supposed to go.

2382
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:34,880
No clues.

2383
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:35,880
No mini-map.

2384
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:36,880
Now this is making me want to just wander around.

2385
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,580
No health bar.

2386
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:40,280
No hit points.

2387
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:43,280
No weapon.

2388
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,060
Nothing.

2389
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:46,720
No indication of where I'm supposed to be going.

2390
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:49,240
I'm just a dude walking out in the forest right now.

2391
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:52,120
This kind of feels like Up in the Corner.

2392
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:54,080
That's all you've ever been, Chris.

2393
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,240
Although I have better frame rate in real life.

2394
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:58,160
Oh, what's this say?

2395
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,160
Two forks.

2396
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,160
Okay.

2397
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:01,160
There we go.

2398
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:02,160
We got to look at it.

2399
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:03,160
Let's go.

2400
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:06,080
Can I jump?

2401
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:07,960
Space bar to climb over obstacles.

2402
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:08,960
Space bar.

2403
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:09,960
There we go.

2404
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:10,960
Perfect.

2405
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:11,960
Wow.

2406
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:12,960
I did quite the jump there.

2407
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,400
Oh, look at that sunshine, Wes.

2408
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,400
Look at that.

2409
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:16,400
Beautiful.

2410
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:17,400
1982.

2411
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:22,480
During the summers, you and Julia enjoy walking Bucket at night.

2412
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:23,480
Bucket.

2413
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:27,240
There's a festival in town that brings folks from faraway places.

2414
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:31,960
One of them tries to mug you with a knife.

2415
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:32,960
Bucket gets kicked.

2416
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:33,960
Oh, that dog.

2417
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:34,960
Oh, that effing dog.

2418
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:35,960
Julia yells.

2419
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:39,040
She gets flustered and has trouble speaking when she gets stressed.

2420
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,040
You confront the attacker.

2421
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:41,040
What do we do?

2422
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:44,040
Do we scare him away or beat him in?

2423
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:45,040
I think we're a gentleman.

2424
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:46,040
We scare him away.

2425
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,040
We scare him away.

2426
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:48,040
Okay.

2427
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:51,960
Reach into your pocket like you've got a gun and threaten to kill him.

2428
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,680
You manage to scare off all three of them.

2429
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:54,680
Wow.

2430
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:55,680
Whoa.

2431
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:57,400
You scare all three of you and he runs away.

2432
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:58,520
This is moving fast.

2433
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,880
Julia has to take a different path from that day forward.

2434
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:01,880
You say it's okay.

2435
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:02,880
You don't want to go that way either.

2436
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:05,880
From then on, you walk by the river.

2437
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:08,960
The river's pretty anyway.

2438
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:09,960
1984.

2439
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:20,200
Plans to have kids have got waylaid by work.

2440
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,840
Julia gets offered a job at Yale.

2441
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:24,240
Yale is in Connecticut, 2,000 miles away.

2442
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:26,360
It's a great job, associate department chair.

2443
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:27,360
She wants to move.

2444
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:34,280
You absolutely do not convince her not to take the job or agree if she commutes back

2445
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:35,280
and forth.

2446
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:36,280
Ouch.

2447
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:37,280
Neither of those are very good options.

2448
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:38,280
Yeah.

2449
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:39,280
Yeah.

2450
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:40,600
Ooh, Chris, this is hitting hard.

2451
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:44,600
I'm going to say agree if she commutes.

2452
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:47,480
I guess so.

2453
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:50,840
If she's angry at us for that, she has every right to be.

2454
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:52,320
You ask if she'll commute back and forth.

2455
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,560
You don't want to move to Connecticut.

2456
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:56,080
She says that'll be hard, but she'll do it for you.

2457
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:57,080
Dang.

2458
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:58,080
Thanks.

2459
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,080
You tell her not to pass it up if she wants.

2460
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:00,080
She agrees.

2461
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:04,000
She flies back to Boulder three times each semester.

2462
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,120
1985.

2463
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:09,980
Julia sent home from Yale on paid leave after having an episode.

2464
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:14,160
She lost it on college for borrowing books that were on a colleague that were important

2465
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:15,160
to her research.

2466
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:17,960
She didn't remember she'd happily loaned them to him just two days prior.

2467
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:18,960
Jeez.

2468
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:22,520
She was found crying in the stairwell.

2469
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:24,760
You say that maybe you guys should talk to someone about it.

2470
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:25,840
That's one option.

2471
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:28,080
You make macaroni and drink wine and try to forget about it.

2472
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:29,400
What do you think?

2473
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:30,400
I say talk to somebody.

2474
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,400
Yeah.

2475
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:32,400
Let's do that.

2476
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,400
Because I'm also worried about that time she came home late.

2477
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:34,400
Yeah.

2478
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:38,160
After seeing multiple doctors and having many tests, they are worried that Julia might be

2479
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:40,080
suffering from early onset dementia.

2480
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:41,080
She's 41.

2481
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:50,520
You decide to keep it a secret for now, for the both of you.

2482
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:51,520
Now we're camping again.

2483
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:55,560
There you go, Wes.

2484
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:56,560
Here's our journal.

2485
01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:01,200
Maybe we should leave it right here and let the viewer at home fill in the rest.

2486
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:02,200
I'm interested though.

2487
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:03,200
I'm hooked.

2488
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:04,200
Whoa.

2489
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:05,520
That's where we should leave it.

2490
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:06,520
Right there.

2491
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:07,520
Right there.

2492
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,520
Perfect.

2493
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:24,640
There you go.
