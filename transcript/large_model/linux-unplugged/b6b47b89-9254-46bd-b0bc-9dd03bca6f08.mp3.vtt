WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.360
Wes, did you see this?

00:01.360 --> 00:03.120
We were talking about this on the pre-show.

00:03.120 --> 00:05.680
Terth in the chat room was, or he is in New York,

00:05.680 --> 00:07.360
and he found a, I don't know if he's like

00:07.360 --> 00:09.320
in a Nixon museum or something.

00:09.320 --> 00:12.400
And he found these Nixon cigarettes.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.600
And if you look at that logo on those Nixon cigarettes.

00:14.600 --> 00:16.720
That sure looked like the Windows logo, doesn't it?

00:16.720 --> 00:17.560
Wow.

00:17.560 --> 00:20.160
Nixon Campaign 72 cigarettes.

00:20.160 --> 00:23.640
These were campaign advertising material.

00:23.640 --> 00:25.740
And they have, that is straight up

00:25.740 --> 00:27.880
the Windows 10 Windows logo on there.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.300
One of the designers at Microsoft

00:29.300 --> 00:31.600
just has that sitting on a shelf in their office.

00:31.600 --> 00:32.600
And you know, you're daydreaming,

00:32.600 --> 00:33.600
trying to think up the next thing.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.440
It's right there.

00:36.360 --> 00:40.040
All that money, and they ripped off a Nixon cigarette.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.160
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 169

00:43.160 --> 00:46.200
for November 1st, 2016.

00:46.200 --> 01:00.280
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

01:00.280 --> 01:04.960
that at least 50% of it proudly uses Nano.

01:04.960 --> 01:05.800
My name is Chris.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.200
My name is Wes.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.960
I won't out you, Wes.

01:08.960 --> 01:09.800
Please don't.

01:09.800 --> 01:10.960
I got a lot of slack this week.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.760
I did, I recorded a video in the Linux Action Show

01:13.760 --> 01:16.160
where I was using, God forbid, Nano.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.000
Ooh.

01:17.000 --> 01:17.820
I know.

01:17.820 --> 01:19.800
That's just a recipe for flame war, man.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.400
Don't worry, I'm gonna make up for it this week

01:21.400 --> 01:22.240
with an hour.

01:22.240 --> 01:23.840
Are you gonna show us your VI skills?

01:23.840 --> 01:26.880
Yeah, I got true VIM skills, yeah.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.240
I'm all about the color coding.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.520
You know, that's not how I'm gonna make it up for you.

01:30.520 --> 01:32.280
I'm gonna make it up for you with a great show.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.680
We have what you would probably classify

01:35.680 --> 01:36.760
as an oversized show.

01:36.760 --> 01:39.880
Now, we don't have the markers, so we may get a ticket,

01:39.880 --> 01:41.960
but it is a huge update section.

01:41.960 --> 01:45.800
We're gonna get into some big developments this week

01:45.800 --> 01:47.360
that I'm a little fired up about.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.000
Then later on, as we move down into the show,

01:49.000 --> 01:51.120
we're gonna pick up the speed as we get busting along,

01:51.120 --> 01:52.720
and we're gonna find some alternative devices

01:52.720 --> 01:54.640
to the Roku that run Linux

01:54.640 --> 01:56.480
that look like they may be coming very soon,

01:56.480 --> 01:59.280
and then we're gonna wrap it all up towards the end

01:59.280 --> 02:01.760
with some quotes from Mr. Greg KH.

02:01.760 --> 02:02.580
Our favorite.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.120
During a recent fireside chat

02:04.120 --> 02:06.520
about kernel development happening over email

02:06.520 --> 02:08.500
and why they still use email,

02:08.500 --> 02:09.340
the guy says, like,

02:09.340 --> 02:10.440
are you guys just a bunch of gray beards?

02:10.440 --> 02:12.960
Like, why aren't you using Slack?

02:13.800 --> 02:15.240
As if, like that's, or whatever.

02:15.240 --> 02:16.080
Like GitHub.

02:16.080 --> 02:17.480
Yeah, yeah.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.240
So they talk about why they still use email

02:19.240 --> 02:21.200
for core Linux kernel development.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.240
He talks about licensing in a way

02:23.240 --> 02:24.600
that's actually interesting,

02:24.600 --> 02:26.880
and some other interesting tidbits

02:26.880 --> 02:29.080
about a bunch of ex-Microsoft employees

02:29.080 --> 02:31.160
now working full-time on the Linux kernel.

02:31.160 --> 02:32.000
All kinds of stuff.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.560
So we'll get into all of those quotes

02:34.560 --> 02:36.600
from his fireside chat once we get through all our updates.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.640
So yeah, we got like a lot of heavy stuff up front,

02:38.640 --> 02:40.480
and then we're gonna really pick up the speed as we go on.

02:40.480 --> 02:42.560
And the people that are gonna help us do that

02:42.560 --> 02:45.720
is our virtual log, time appropriate greetings, mumbaroom.

02:45.720 --> 02:46.560
Pip, pip.

02:46.560 --> 02:47.380
Hello.

02:47.380 --> 02:48.220
Time appropriate greetings.

02:48.220 --> 02:49.060
Hello.

02:49.060 --> 02:49.880
Hey, what's your podcast?

02:49.880 --> 02:50.720
Oh.

02:50.720 --> 02:51.560
Hello.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.040
I'm not sure what that was there.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.480
I don't know what that was exactly.

02:54.480 --> 02:55.600
Who was that?

02:55.600 --> 02:57.240
Hmm, I don't know, probably a mole.

02:57.240 --> 03:00.960
Let's start with some really nice, like, kind of happy news.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.480
Because sometimes we start with like breaking news

03:02.480 --> 03:03.800
with everything is ruined.

03:03.800 --> 03:04.640
Yes, right.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.240
I thought it would be fun to talk about Mr. Robot.

03:06.240 --> 03:09.240
Six ways Mr. Robot is putting Linux in the public eye.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.200
And this is kind of legit.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.600
I mean, really early on,

03:11.600 --> 03:14.240
they had the gnome KDE clip.

03:14.240 --> 03:15.560
Do you remember that on Mr. Robot?

03:15.560 --> 03:17.280
So I see a running gnome.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.640
You know, I'm actually on KDE myself.

03:21.640 --> 03:24.120
I know this desktop environment is supposed to be better,

03:24.120 --> 03:26.760
but you know what they say.

03:26.760 --> 03:29.040
Old habits, they die hard.

03:29.040 --> 03:29.880
Look at that.

03:29.880 --> 03:30.720
That face is perfect.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.680
I'm like, what the?

03:32.680 --> 03:33.760
I'm an executive.

03:33.760 --> 03:36.240
I mean, why am I even running Linux?

03:37.640 --> 03:38.480
I love that.

03:38.480 --> 03:41.120
And that was when we actually watched the show.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.320
And they also, recently they showed a screenshot

03:43.320 --> 03:44.160
of Kali Linux.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.000
Hey, look at that.

03:45.000 --> 03:45.840
Which is totally legit.

03:45.840 --> 03:46.680
Bonafide.

03:46.680 --> 03:47.960
And of course, often they'll show shots

03:47.960 --> 03:50.320
of the command line and real shell commands,

03:50.320 --> 03:52.120
which is pretty great.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.160
So I don't know if you are,

03:53.160 --> 03:54.600
now don't know spoilers,

03:54.600 --> 03:56.560
but have you ever watching like TV

03:56.560 --> 03:57.480
when you see like a Linux thing

03:57.480 --> 03:58.920
and it just like totally like, oh my gosh.

03:58.920 --> 03:59.840
Like if you're watching Mr. Robot,

03:59.840 --> 04:00.880
you're getting that all the time probably,

04:00.880 --> 04:03.240
but every now and then you're watching random television.

04:03.240 --> 04:04.880
It adds that like one layer of depth, you know,

04:04.880 --> 04:06.640
it's like, I mean, you're already kind of,

04:06.640 --> 04:07.840
you know, you're going with the show,

04:07.840 --> 04:08.880
you're buying into their storyline,

04:08.880 --> 04:09.720
but when you're like,

04:09.720 --> 04:11.200
it's like fake terminal commands

04:11.200 --> 04:12.040
and you're like,

04:12.040 --> 04:13.640
you could have just filmed a real terminal.

04:13.640 --> 04:14.480
It would have worked fine.

04:14.480 --> 04:15.320
You don't need to like make up this thing

04:15.320 --> 04:16.680
that just like kind of takes me out of the moment

04:16.680 --> 04:17.520
from the show.

04:17.520 --> 04:19.440
So I appreciate the depth that they go to.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.280
Yeah, yeah.

04:20.280 --> 04:25.160
I was watching a news clip on virtual reality

04:25.160 --> 04:28.000
and you know how the news is about covering virtual reality.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.700
And so they're in a room where the guy's got the headset on

04:30.700 --> 04:32.160
and they're developing new technologies

04:32.160 --> 04:34.280
and it's a typical shot of this guy

04:34.280 --> 04:36.000
making a clown out of himself.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.920
And the news camera pans over

04:37.920 --> 04:39.840
to where the computers are at

04:39.840 --> 04:40.840
and you know, it's VR.

04:40.840 --> 04:44.120
So I'm thinking this is going to be a Windows box.

04:44.120 --> 04:48.080
And no kidding, it was an Ubuntu Unity desktop.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.720
You see that, you see that dock right on the left?

04:49.720 --> 04:50.560
There you go.

04:50.560 --> 04:53.160
Classic dock with that GTK2 looking bar

04:53.160 --> 04:54.760
that hasn't been updated since 1984.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.640
It looks, I mean, it's, you can't misplace it.

04:57.640 --> 05:00.040
It's Unity and it's all its glory and everything else.

05:00.040 --> 05:00.880
That's awesome.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.280
And I was like, wait, wait, wait a minute.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.380
Hold on.

05:03.380 --> 05:05.360
How come they get VR on Linux

05:05.360 --> 05:06.600
and I don't get VR on Linux?

05:06.600 --> 05:07.440
How do we get that?

05:07.440 --> 05:08.280
How did that happen?

05:08.280 --> 05:09.520
I was watching that and I'm like, hold on now.

05:09.520 --> 05:10.360
How does the CBS move?

05:10.360 --> 05:11.200
They didn't have show notes

05:11.200 --> 05:12.040
telling you how to set that up.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.320
That's the problem.

05:13.320 --> 05:16.480
Yeah, CBS needed to put a link in the show notes for sure.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.800
And so I guess there's some VRs working under Linux

05:18.800 --> 05:20.160
because these researchers were using it.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.240
And so that was one of my most recent,

05:22.240 --> 05:23.520
sitting there reviewing clips

05:23.520 --> 05:25.960
and I'm looking at this and going, what the?

05:25.960 --> 05:27.320
Where did this come from?

05:27.320 --> 05:28.400
Where did this come from?

05:28.400 --> 05:31.160
Okay, so I also wanted to do another little positive story

05:31.160 --> 05:33.520
that I just wanted to throw out there.

05:33.520 --> 05:36.640
This is your official Linux Unplugged reminder.

05:36.640 --> 05:37.540
It's November.

05:40.760 --> 05:41.840
God damn it.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.040
And there's holidays coming up.

05:43.040 --> 05:43.880
No.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.880
And if you take some pictures and something goes wrong,

05:47.880 --> 05:49.760
I want you to remember that in 169,

05:49.760 --> 05:51.760
Chris and Wes hooked you up

05:51.760 --> 05:53.340
with how to recover those pictures.

05:53.340 --> 05:54.720
This is a great post.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.880
Search and rescue SD card recovery.

05:57.880 --> 06:00.640
He has a Canon EOS 300D.

06:00.640 --> 06:03.660
You know, it's an old SLR camera.

06:03.660 --> 06:06.360
And his SD card file system corrupted or something on him.

06:06.360 --> 06:09.120
He lost all his pictures when he went to Mo's Fest,

06:09.120 --> 06:11.760
the Mozilla Festival a couple of weeks back.

06:11.760 --> 06:14.080
Yeah, and so he wanted to do

06:14.080 --> 06:16.440
the entire restoration under Linux.

06:16.440 --> 06:19.340
And so he goes through the different tools he used

06:19.340 --> 06:21.960
to restore his SD card contents

06:21.960 --> 06:24.560
and recover his photos under Linux

06:24.560 --> 06:25.760
and then documents it all right there

06:25.760 --> 06:27.840
with a nice epic wind screenshot

06:27.840 --> 06:30.760
of the Nautilus file browser full of his restored photos.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.840
And I don't really, we don't need to bust through this

06:32.840 --> 06:34.160
because this is really only applicable

06:34.160 --> 06:35.720
to people that are in this situation.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.200
But it is in the show notes.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.320
It's nice to have because you don't want to be worrying

06:39.320 --> 06:40.640
about where to go find the tutorial

06:40.640 --> 06:42.200
and if it's up to date and all that

06:42.200 --> 06:44.400
when you're desperately trying to recover your files.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.400
Yeah, and I also just wanted to kind of spotlight

06:46.400 --> 06:49.440
really good, you know, this kind of blogging is just great.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.200
It's great when you see this kind of stuff come along.

06:51.200 --> 06:55.060
So I just wanted to kind of give it a little attention

06:55.060 --> 06:55.900
as it were.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.840
There is a story that's been percolating around

06:57.840 --> 06:59.560
for about two weeks now

06:59.560 --> 07:01.480
and it doesn't seem to be dying off.

07:01.480 --> 07:02.560
So I've decided we'd talk about it

07:02.560 --> 07:04.800
because at first my reaction was like, this is not a big...

07:04.800 --> 07:06.880
Right, what is it, is it anything?

07:06.880 --> 07:07.760
But you know, it's getting,

07:07.760 --> 07:09.800
it continues to get posted on Hacker News.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.360
It continues to get written about.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.960
And so I thought I'd link to the OMG coverage here.

07:13.960 --> 07:18.000
Linux market share has remained above 2%

07:18.000 --> 07:20.160
on the desktop for the third month in a row.

07:21.160 --> 07:22.920
This is according to NetMarketshare

07:22.920 --> 07:24.320
and it's a data analytics company.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.560
I'll tell you where they source their data from in a moment.

07:26.560 --> 07:29.240
But it looks like this has been holding steady since July

07:29.240 --> 07:30.840
and it looks like it's continuing to climb.

07:30.840 --> 07:35.840
In fact, it's gone up to 2.33% since then.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.160
You know, here's the thing, guys.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.680
NetMarketshare bases its data on the number of visitors

07:40.680 --> 07:42.760
to 40,000 websites.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.680
It's not like it's an insignificant sample size,

07:45.680 --> 07:48.120
but compared to the overall Linux desktop market,

07:48.120 --> 07:50.240
there's no way it's representative.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.920
But it's an interesting data point.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.760
You can also look at Wikimedia, which shows 1.2%

07:54.760 --> 07:56.360
if you include Ubuntu, Red Hat, and SUSE,

07:56.360 --> 07:57.920
but doesn't look at other distros.

07:57.920 --> 08:02.920
But, you know, the reality is we'll never have an idea.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.400
We'll never have an idea, but there are-

08:04.400 --> 08:06.360
Even just talking about that's making me realize,

08:06.360 --> 08:08.280
you know, just think about how would you do that?

08:08.280 --> 08:09.120
And it would be hard.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.880
It's a hard thing to get a good number on.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.400
You know what I have kind of relied on

08:12.400 --> 08:14.560
is aggregating different data sources over the years.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.760
So I look at things like these types of reports

08:17.760 --> 08:20.680
from NetMarket, but I also look at the Wikimedia stuff

08:20.680 --> 08:23.800
and I look at Steam and I look at the W3 schools

08:23.800 --> 08:26.000
and kind of aggregate them all together.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.240
And I will say this, in aggregate, there is an uptick.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.000
There does seem to be a pretty consistent uptick

08:32.000 --> 08:32.840
in aggregate.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.640
It's nothing major, but then of course,

08:34.640 --> 08:37.280
how you measure these things is pretty difficult.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.600
Yeah, that's definitely true.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.600
The graph is sure not that exciting though.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.960
No, no, it's not that exciting.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.320
You know what is exciting?

08:45.320 --> 08:50.240
Freaking 1.9.22 of wine.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.880
First of all, it lets you play Max Payne 2,

08:51.880 --> 08:53.080
which made me think of you.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.360
But coming just two weeks after the previous wine,

08:55.360 --> 08:57.240
yes, I'm actually gonna report on a version of wine.

08:57.240 --> 08:58.240
Doesn't happen often.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.080
It doesn't.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.960
They've added some nice support for Direct2D.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.860
They've fixed 25 bugs and they've added improvement

09:03.860 --> 09:04.800
to multiple Windows games.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.660
But the one thing that really matters, Wes,

09:06.660 --> 09:08.440
the thing that matters the most,

09:08.440 --> 09:11.920
is they have resurrected support for a game

09:11.920 --> 09:14.240
from November of 1996.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.080
It's almost perfect.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.960
The anniversary is right here.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.080
It's very important to me.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.120
It was not a good game at all.

09:20.120 --> 09:22.160
It shouldn't have anybody working on it,

09:22.160 --> 09:25.240
but they have done it and it's called Star Trek Horde.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.080
Hold on, buddy.

09:26.080 --> 09:26.900
We need you conscious.

09:26.900 --> 09:27.740
Don't go to one of your Payne trances.

09:27.740 --> 09:28.580
Ah!

09:28.580 --> 09:29.420
Get off!

09:29.420 --> 09:30.240
Furlong!

09:30.240 --> 09:33.240
Furlong, get out of here!

09:33.240 --> 09:34.080
I'm sorry.

09:38.480 --> 09:41.040
You are in a bajani Payne trance.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.320
Your friend Furlong wasn't able to stop it.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.640
The Borg don't seem to notice, though.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.940
They're assimilating you at this very moment.

09:46.940 --> 09:48.940
At least this time, you won't feel it.

09:48.940 --> 09:51.440
Oh, it looks like you're waking up.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.360
So this is like a quick time events driven game, but.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.320
Oh, I see.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.240
Interesting.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.000
There is a star, so they were filming it

09:58.000 --> 09:59.680
using all the existing Star Trek sets

09:59.680 --> 10:02.440
and Star Trek sound effects and the Star Trek directing.

10:02.440 --> 10:03.680
It's our friend John de Lancie.

10:03.680 --> 10:06.600
Yeah, but there is actually one thing

10:06.600 --> 10:08.480
of rather interest canon addition

10:08.480 --> 10:10.720
that they bring to the Star Trek canon in this game.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.320
So if you're a Star Trek fan,

10:12.320 --> 10:14.440
it's worth playing just for that.

10:14.440 --> 10:16.100
So it's kind of cool that it's a game

10:16.100 --> 10:18.120
that if it passed you by and you kind of want to,

10:18.120 --> 10:22.560
it's an interactive Star Trek episode.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.000
If you've ever seen Minecraft Story Mode

10:24.000 --> 10:24.840
or anything like that,

10:24.840 --> 10:26.080
it's basically that with,

10:26.080 --> 10:29.040
and it was the pinnacle of quick time events games,

10:29.040 --> 10:30.320
which is not saying much.

10:32.680 --> 10:33.520
That's great.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.680
It starts like a legitimate game of,

10:35.680 --> 10:38.680
or it starts like a legitimate television show of Star Trek.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.400
Like here, this is gonna get us pulled down, but.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.080
USS Canali to USS Cheyenne.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.000
We are under attack by Borg forces.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.520
Repeat, Borg forces, re-intercept the two Borg vessels.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.440
Can you just mix this with your VR headset?

10:50.440 --> 10:52.080
I'd be entertained for hours.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.920
Actually, that could be pretty good, right?

10:54.920 --> 10:57.320
Especially if you could move around the entire space.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.200
I have the whole thing,

10:58.200 --> 11:00.480
if you would just want to watch it and not play it.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.760
But it's a first person perspective game

11:02.760 --> 11:04.760
where you walk around the halls of the ship,

11:04.760 --> 11:06.540
interact with officers.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.320
It even has credits and all of the music

11:08.320 --> 11:10.040
just like a Star Trek episode.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.600
It looks like a Star Trek episode

11:11.600 --> 11:12.640
from first person perspective.

11:12.640 --> 11:13.900
This is great.

11:13.900 --> 11:15.080
So it's kind of neat.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.720
Oh, relate, geez.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.200
Yeah, it's kind of neat though

11:20.200 --> 11:22.080
because you can pick this game up for really cheap

11:22.080 --> 11:23.000
or you can find it online

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
and now you'll be able to run it under Linux.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.440
It's wild that people are working on that and now it works.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.560
Ridiculous maybe, you might add, pointless.

11:30.560 --> 11:35.560
But also, it's what I love about Wine and Linux is

11:36.120 --> 11:38.040
there is something incredibly nostalgic

11:38.040 --> 11:40.360
about taking some of my favorite old games,

11:40.360 --> 11:42.680
even like ones that I bought on GOG a while ago

11:42.680 --> 11:45.280
that I can now play under Wine

11:45.280 --> 11:49.120
and not have to hassle with a Windows crappy VM

11:49.120 --> 11:50.400
or any of that junk.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.240
Any of that.

11:52.160 --> 11:54.120
It's amazing that Linux can do more.

11:54.120 --> 11:54.960
You wonder at some point,

11:54.960 --> 11:56.520
like some of these older games of Wine

11:56.520 --> 11:57.760
will start being able to be a better place

11:57.760 --> 11:59.280
to run them than modern Windows.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.680
Yeah, maybe they'll do like a hard break one day

12:01.680 --> 12:02.520
on the Windows platform.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.040
They're like, okay, this technical debt

12:04.040 --> 12:05.080
has gotten so crazy,

12:05.080 --> 12:07.560
we're gonna move to the next version of Windows.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.320
Well, they'll probably retain the Linux environment

12:09.320 --> 12:10.720
and they'll use Wine.

12:10.720 --> 12:13.320
Wine in the Linux subsystems around old Windows games.

12:13.320 --> 12:14.720
Okay, great, we've called it here.

12:14.720 --> 12:17.520
Yeah, there's our prediction on the unplugged program.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.560
Yikes, but I do think it's really cool

12:20.560 --> 12:21.520
that they added that stuff.

12:21.520 --> 12:22.400
Hey, before we go any further,

12:22.400 --> 12:25.240
let's talk about the opposite of that complicated mess.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.240
Let's talk about something that makes mobile simple

12:27.240 --> 12:28.080
and that's Ting.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.480
Go to linux.ting.com,

12:29.480 --> 12:31.440
where they're on a mission to make mobile make sense.

12:31.440 --> 12:32.280
And here's why.

12:32.280 --> 12:34.320
There's no contract, no other termination fee,

12:34.320 --> 12:37.360
and you only pay for what you use.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.120
Six dollars for each line.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.880
You got one phone, you got three phones,

12:40.880 --> 12:42.440
it's six dollars for each one of them.

12:42.440 --> 12:44.160
It's nice, simple, straightforward,

12:44.160 --> 12:47.040
GSM and CDMA networks that you get to choose from.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.160
And if you're in business,

12:49.160 --> 12:50.840
this is something you should really consider,

12:50.840 --> 12:53.360
especially if you're kind of like a smaller business.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.000
But even anybody that has like,

12:55.000 --> 12:56.400
for me, like with three or four devices,

12:56.400 --> 12:57.320
it's just fantastic.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.240
But even when you go above 10 devices,

12:59.240 --> 13:01.960
the savings is nuts because it's just six dollars

13:01.960 --> 13:03.400
and then your staff's usage.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.000
And if you got Wi-Fi at your office

13:05.000 --> 13:06.600
and they got Wi-Fi at home,

13:06.600 --> 13:09.360
that's ridiculous what you can get away with.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.640
And it's perfect for those things where like,

13:10.640 --> 13:12.000
well, maybe you need like just a backup

13:12.000 --> 13:14.160
internet connection for your office,

13:14.160 --> 13:16.560
but you're gonna use it what, one time a year?

13:16.560 --> 13:17.400
Yeah, yeah.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.000
It's so nice because if you go over

13:19.000 --> 13:21.440
to the Ting Buy page or the Shop page,

13:21.440 --> 13:22.840
you can just get a little SIM card

13:22.840 --> 13:24.440
and you can put it in a MyFi you get off eBay

13:24.440 --> 13:26.000
or you can get one of the MyFis directly from them,

13:26.000 --> 13:27.280
keep that in your drawer,

13:27.280 --> 13:29.560
and the day your Comcast connection goes out,

13:29.560 --> 13:30.480
you fire this up.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.680
Literally, I've done that twice here at JB.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.440
One time.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.800
Six dollars a month for that kind of like,

13:35.800 --> 13:38.120
you know, just knowing it'll work.

13:38.120 --> 13:40.660
One time, this story is a couple years old now,

13:40.660 --> 13:43.380
but it's such a classic and it's so perfect.

13:43.380 --> 13:45.760
It's just a perfect example is Alan Jude

13:45.760 --> 13:48.600
flew out here to record TechSnap in person.

13:48.600 --> 13:49.600
How often does that happen?

13:49.600 --> 13:50.920
You know, a couple times ever.

13:50.920 --> 13:53.280
And he shows up and Comcast is down.

13:53.280 --> 13:54.560
And what are we gonna not record?

13:54.560 --> 13:55.400
He's here for the day.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.320
What are we gonna not do a show?

13:57.320 --> 13:58.520
And I gotta show visuals,

13:58.520 --> 13:59.840
I gotta look up stuff for the stories,

13:59.840 --> 14:01.120
he's gotta read sites.

14:01.120 --> 14:05.400
So we set up Ting, we set up a Wi-Fi hotspot on my Nexus,

14:05.400 --> 14:07.040
and just connected our laptops to that.

14:07.040 --> 14:10.200
Our laptops had connection, we recorded two shows

14:10.200 --> 14:12.040
over the Ting connection that day.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.560
Ting saved it and it was just,

14:13.560 --> 14:14.980
that's just so nice, like tethering and stuff,

14:14.980 --> 14:17.080
or hotspot, it's just a check box.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.120
It's not a big deal.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.620
Also, check out the Ting blog.

14:19.620 --> 14:20.840
They went and pulled their Redditors

14:20.840 --> 14:23.360
and they shared seven different hacks

14:23.360 --> 14:25.520
to help save money on mobile.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.380
That's pretty cool.

14:26.380 --> 14:29.320
They also are pushing now the Moto G4 Play,

14:29.320 --> 14:33.720
a pretty nice mid-sized device at a great price, $150.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.560
No contract, no determination fee.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.300
And if you go to linux.ting.com,

14:37.300 --> 14:40.940
you get $25 off your device or $25 in service credit.

14:40.940 --> 14:43.120
linux.ting.com, and a big thank you to Ting

14:43.120 --> 14:46.000
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

14:46.840 --> 14:48.640
All right, before we get into something really heavy,

14:48.640 --> 14:50.120
I do have something really fun

14:50.120 --> 14:53.120
that I just wanted to give a shout out to.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.160
Users over on linux underscore gaming

14:55.160 --> 14:57.400
organized together to bribe Aspire

14:57.400 --> 15:02.400
into porting Civ 6 to Linux.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.960
And it was looking like it was gonna be maybe murky.

15:04.960 --> 15:07.280
They were evaluating the cost, you know.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.920
There's a Mac version they wanna make as well,

15:09.920 --> 15:13.840
and they were nice and public in commenting in thread

15:13.840 --> 15:14.960
saying, you know, we're not really sure

15:14.960 --> 15:16.440
we're in the research stage.

15:16.440 --> 15:17.920
The bottom line is we need to prove to ourselves,

15:17.920 --> 15:20.600
our partners, and to our partners that a Linux version

15:20.600 --> 15:23.080
can perform to our standards, you know, monetarily.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.200
Right, right.

15:24.200 --> 15:27.480
And so the Linux underscore gaming guys and gals

15:27.480 --> 15:32.480
got together and sent them a box of Tiff's Treats,

15:32.920 --> 15:35.200
which is a local Austin cookie company,

15:35.200 --> 15:37.920
and sent them boxes after boxes of cookies.

15:37.920 --> 15:39.400
In fact, they have another one scheduled

15:39.400 --> 15:41.360
to be delivered on Thursday this week.

15:41.360 --> 15:44.640
And Aspire Media, or Aspire, took notice.

15:44.640 --> 15:45.860
And they said, they tweeted out,

15:45.860 --> 15:47.160
this just came in the mail this morning.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.720
Thank you, you lovely Linux people.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.760
Your guilt trip has been accepted.

15:51.640 --> 15:53.600
Hashtag nom, nom, nom.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.300
Then another tweet comes out, says the Linux team

15:55.300 --> 15:57.320
would like to offer their thanks

15:57.320 --> 15:59.640
as with the majority of the companies,

15:59.640 --> 16:01.000
and thanks to Tiffany's Treats.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.280
And then they posted some more pictures

16:02.280 --> 16:04.800
of people passing out from cookie overdoses.

16:04.800 --> 16:05.920
That's a great strategy.

16:05.920 --> 16:08.120
I mean, at some point, everyone in the company

16:08.120 --> 16:10.240
is gonna have stopped by, they're gonna have enough cookies.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.080
Everyone's gonna have some.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.740
Everyone asked where it came from.

16:12.740 --> 16:14.640
Now everyone's talking about Linux.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.480
Yeah.

16:15.480 --> 16:16.820
And it's also got some interesting details

16:16.820 --> 16:19.160
that Blair on the Linux Gaming subreddit shared.

16:19.160 --> 16:20.520
Blair works at Aspire Media.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.200
He says, their team fluctuates.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.240
The Linux, they have asked,

16:23.240 --> 16:24.240
how many people are on the Linux team?

16:24.240 --> 16:25.800
So the team fluctuates.

16:25.800 --> 16:29.200
Because Mac and Linux teams are shared resources.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.960
I think this is actually a super common setup.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.160
I bet so, yeah.

16:32.160 --> 16:36.800
So it can be as little as 25 or the full company of 70.

16:36.800 --> 16:37.700
Actually, that's not true.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.560
We have a couple of guys dedicated to Android

16:39.560 --> 16:41.280
and an internal IP team working on some secret stuff.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.520
So it's more like 60.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.080
Here's what I want to underscore.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.380
The topic we're about to get into.

16:46.380 --> 16:50.000
We're gonna talk about stuff from a tools perspective

16:50.000 --> 16:52.280
and what end users need perspective.

16:52.280 --> 16:55.580
But I want you to keep in the back of your mind also

16:55.580 --> 16:58.400
the value judgment that companies have to make

16:58.400 --> 16:59.480
when they watch user bases.

16:59.480 --> 17:02.080
Now we just talked about the Linux user base growing.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.200
It's nothing major.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.700
We talked about growth there.

17:05.660 --> 17:06.900
I want to transition from this

17:06.900 --> 17:08.440
and talk about something that I also think

17:08.440 --> 17:10.400
is gonna contribute to more Linux users

17:10.400 --> 17:14.860
which may change companies like Aspire Media's calculus.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.640
It is the elephant in the room

17:17.640 --> 17:19.240
and I know this is a Linux podcast,

17:19.240 --> 17:21.720
but there is definitely a Linux angle on this.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.100
And it's what everybody on the internet

17:23.100 --> 17:25.200
is freaking out about this week.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.600
And that is the new MacBooks.

17:27.600 --> 17:29.680
The new MacBook Pros with the touch bar.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.200
Everybody is freaking out about this.

17:33.200 --> 17:37.400
And I guess to highlight,

17:37.400 --> 17:39.000
I won't repeat the things that I've said

17:39.000 --> 17:40.560
in Coda Radio this week,

17:40.560 --> 17:44.480
but I think it is probably worth touching on

17:44.480 --> 17:48.040
the couple of major limitations of the new MacBook.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.320
16 gigs of RAM is gonna be a maximum.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.960
Is an unbelievable limitation.

17:52.960 --> 17:55.840
I mean it's just a ridiculous limitation.

17:55.840 --> 18:00.240
The cost premium too is astronomical on these new MacBooks.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.080
I understand.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.320
It's not like it's got cheaper.

18:02.320 --> 18:07.040
Yeah, this is, I feel like this is gonna be a prime time

18:07.040 --> 18:08.200
to switch a lot of people to Linux.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.840
And here's why.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.820
System76 has been tweeting a bit about this.

18:11.820 --> 18:14.320
They say due to high website traffic after Apple's events

18:14.320 --> 18:16.340
they've had to add more infrastructure.

18:16.340 --> 18:18.240
Emma, the person that takes a lot of the sales calls

18:18.240 --> 18:19.840
at System76 tweeted out that she's getting

18:19.840 --> 18:22.560
more Apple switcher calls than she's ever gotten.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.400
Wow.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.000
Coming into System76 right now.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
I wanna kinda, and also a longtime Apple blogger,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.160
John Gruber over at daringfireball.com

18:34.160 --> 18:36.680
took some shots at System76 as a result of this.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.320
So I wanna talk about all of this.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.280
But does anybody in the Mumba Room wanna open up

18:41.280 --> 18:43.200
with their reaction to the new MacBook?

18:46.800 --> 18:47.820
It's all cocky.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.100
I mean when I say, why though?

18:51.100 --> 18:53.600
I mean let's be critical, but let's do it

18:53.600 --> 18:54.480
in like an informed way.

18:54.480 --> 18:56.200
Cause I mean we can't just hate it because it's Apple.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.040
Right.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.360
Let's be realistic here.

18:58.360 --> 18:59.360
Pretend Dell made it.

18:59.360 --> 19:00.800
Yeah, pretend Dell made this or something.

19:00.800 --> 19:01.960
I mean this seems like to me,

19:01.960 --> 19:03.640
but actually you can't do that.

19:03.640 --> 19:04.840
See the reason why you can't do that

19:04.840 --> 19:07.680
is Apple is the only company that makes computers

19:07.680 --> 19:08.560
that run Mac OS.

19:08.560 --> 19:09.400
True.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.320
And so if you require an application

19:11.320 --> 19:12.680
on the Mac OS platform.

19:12.680 --> 19:13.500
That's where you're at.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.500
You are forced to buy Apple's products.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.820
And so that, I think in this context,

19:17.820 --> 19:19.360
it's way more important that Apple

19:19.360 --> 19:20.920
gets these product releases right.

19:20.920 --> 19:24.800
It's not as easy to forgive a mistake on Apple's case

19:24.800 --> 19:25.860
like it is on Dell.

19:25.860 --> 19:28.000
By the way, do any of us give a shit

19:28.000 --> 19:30.760
that the XPS 13 has a max of 16 gigs of RAM?

19:30.760 --> 19:32.040
Did you know that?

19:32.040 --> 19:33.000
No, we don't.

19:33.000 --> 19:33.840
No, we don't.

19:33.840 --> 19:34.680
Because it's not Apple.

19:34.680 --> 19:35.500
Because it's Dell.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.340
It's Dell.

19:36.340 --> 19:39.960
The Dell XPS 13 that we've all lovingly talked about,

19:39.960 --> 19:42.000
the one I own, the one you own,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.240
has a max of 16 gigs of RAM right now.

19:44.240 --> 19:47.040
But it doesn't matter because it's one

19:47.040 --> 19:48.920
of a hundred different products that Dell sells

19:48.920 --> 19:50.880
and it's one of a million different products

19:50.880 --> 19:51.860
I can run Linux on.

19:51.860 --> 19:52.700
Exactly.

19:52.700 --> 19:53.880
So it doesn't matter.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.620
But when Apple makes this mistake,

19:55.620 --> 19:57.800
when they ship a pro product that only supports

19:57.800 --> 20:00.640
16 gigs of RAM, there is going to be a class

20:00.640 --> 20:02.240
of high-end users that are gonna look at that

20:02.240 --> 20:04.760
and say, that is a ridiculous limitation

20:04.760 --> 20:06.240
and I'm moving to another platform

20:06.240 --> 20:08.200
and it sure as hell is not gonna be Windows.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.920
And it's not just me saying that.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.640
This is, there is threat.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.400
I thought about doing like just a roundup

20:13.400 --> 20:15.160
of all the different hacker news posts

20:15.160 --> 20:16.740
and Reddit posts and blog posts

20:16.740 --> 20:18.360
and Medium posts about this.

20:18.360 --> 20:20.120
There is hundreds of them right now.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.440
And you know what?

20:21.440 --> 20:25.440
It is, if you do word searches in the comments sections

20:25.440 --> 20:26.920
and in these posts, they're talking about

20:26.920 --> 20:28.320
switching to Linux.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.240
It's wild.

20:31.240 --> 20:32.480
But it makes sense, I think.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.320
It's interesting.

20:33.320 --> 20:34.900
It's because Apple is following the path

20:34.900 --> 20:37.320
of we want thin, light, and high battery life.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.880
And so they can't have two so dims

20:38.880 --> 20:40.480
to support 32 gigs of RAM.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.920
And they're not gonna put a GPU in there

20:41.920 --> 20:44.640
if they don't have to, or at least a beefy GPU.

20:44.640 --> 20:45.760
Because that would take up too much room

20:45.760 --> 20:47.880
and reduce battery life and it would reduce thinness.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.820
Yeah, it appears, so it appears the true reason

20:50.820 --> 20:54.640
behind the lack of 32 gigs of RAM or DDR4 is Intel.

20:54.640 --> 20:57.680
Skylake doesn't support LPD DDR4,

20:57.680 --> 20:59.520
which LP stands for low power.

20:59.520 --> 21:01.400
And Kaby Lake is set to include support

21:01.400 --> 21:03.040
but only for U category of chips.

21:03.040 --> 21:08.040
So again, no LPD DDR4 until 2018 in mobile.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.080
Yep.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.160
Surface Book only goes up to 16 gigabytes too.

21:16.160 --> 21:17.760
But if they had two so dim slots,

21:17.760 --> 21:19.960
so if they sacrifice some space

21:19.960 --> 21:21.360
and some more board real estate,

21:21.360 --> 21:23.160
they could actually do 32 gigs.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.000
Which is what other people are doing with DDR4.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.040
They're doing two so dims that are 16 gigs each.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.560
Now the argument is those types of boards

21:29.560 --> 21:31.880
get way worse battery life.

21:31.880 --> 21:32.800
They do.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.280
And they sacrifice room that you could put batteries in.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.280
And I think a lot of Apple professionals

21:37.280 --> 21:38.720
would sacrifice battery life

21:38.720 --> 21:40.040
to have a machine that is capable.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.600
Oh absolutely, I think Apple didn't make the compromise

21:42.600 --> 21:45.200
of having a really high-end workstation replacement machine

21:45.200 --> 21:47.800
and they only went with like a lighter, smaller,

21:47.800 --> 21:49.840
better battery life type machine.

21:49.840 --> 21:51.280
Right, when you're making the play

21:51.280 --> 21:53.280
to the everyman Apple product,

21:53.280 --> 21:55.400
you miss the people in all the businesses

21:55.400 --> 21:57.720
who they get their managers to get them the Mac

21:57.720 --> 22:00.080
and then it sits on their desk plugged into nice monitors

22:00.080 --> 22:02.520
and they want it for the environment that they're used to

22:02.520 --> 22:04.240
and for the Unix command line.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.720
But yeah, if you look at a competing product

22:05.720 --> 22:07.920
like the Surface Book Pro, or sorry, the Surface Book,

22:07.920 --> 22:09.720
and you look at say the X1 Carbon

22:09.720 --> 22:11.680
and you look at the XPS 13,

22:11.680 --> 22:14.560
those also gimp and sacrifice those same features

22:14.560 --> 22:15.760
that you want on a workstation.

22:15.760 --> 22:18.440
Again though, I say the scale of aggression there

22:18.440 --> 22:20.360
or egregion there is much lower.

22:20.360 --> 22:21.840
And I'll get into my personal take on it,

22:21.840 --> 22:23.480
but I wanna give Mohsen Rath a chance to jump in

22:23.480 --> 22:25.400
because he thinks we're just hating on the leader.

22:25.400 --> 22:27.200
So Mohsen Rath, you go and I wanna get your perspective

22:27.200 --> 22:28.600
on it real quick.

22:28.600 --> 22:31.880
Okay, you guys were talking about this a few days ago

22:31.880 --> 22:34.520
on one of the other shows, if I'm not mistaken.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.800
And my understanding with when I'm hearing

22:37.800 --> 22:38.920
all the different arguments

22:38.920 --> 22:40.480
and what I'm seeing in the chat room,

22:40.480 --> 22:44.240
a lot of it tends to be, well, Apple should do this,

22:44.240 --> 22:45.400
Apple should do this,

22:45.400 --> 22:47.720
but you gotta sit there and think to yourself,

22:47.720 --> 22:49.640
Apple's gonna think of the bottom line.

22:49.640 --> 22:51.560
So if they don't think that there's gonna be people

22:51.560 --> 22:54.240
that are going to want to pay for it

22:54.240 --> 22:57.280
based off of the scale that they're going to price it at,

22:57.280 --> 23:00.120
and we were discussing this in the chat room the other day,

23:00.120 --> 23:01.160
well, not in the chat room,

23:01.160 --> 23:02.600
gone to the IRC the other day,

23:02.600 --> 23:04.360
I didn't actually try to do the math,

23:04.360 --> 23:07.320
but you guys have complained about how much it costs

23:07.320 --> 23:09.280
for stuff for Apple before.

23:09.280 --> 23:12.480
The people at RIP Tech Syndicate

23:12.480 --> 23:14.920
complained about this stuff for Apple before

23:14.920 --> 23:17.080
in terms of the prices and the pricing.

23:17.080 --> 23:19.760
Do the math yourself, seriously.

23:19.760 --> 23:22.960
Spend some time on the show right now.

23:22.960 --> 23:25.840
Go to the website, do the scale, right?

23:25.840 --> 23:29.760
Eight to 16 or eight to 12 or however you want to do it.

23:29.760 --> 23:32.680
Do the arithmetic sequence,

23:32.680 --> 23:35.320
see how much it would be for the 32.

23:35.320 --> 23:38.520
Anything else about sizing, battery life at all,

23:38.520 --> 23:42.000
take a look at where the actual price point

23:42.000 --> 23:45.200
according to their would be based off of everything else.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.960
And then you sit there and ask yourself,

23:46.960 --> 23:48.840
who's going to pay for that?

23:48.840 --> 23:53.320
If you can't see yourself going to pay for that,

23:53.320 --> 23:54.560
then how are you going to see

23:54.560 --> 23:56.280
anyone else going to pay for that?

23:56.280 --> 23:57.120
I think the difference-

23:57.120 --> 23:59.280
If Apple figured that someone would pay for it,

23:59.280 --> 24:00.120
they would do it.

24:00.120 --> 24:01.240
I think the difference here is that

24:01.240 --> 24:03.360
there is a significant amount that,

24:03.360 --> 24:05.880
that would matter a lot to me in my personal life,

24:05.880 --> 24:07.400
but for the business world,

24:07.400 --> 24:08.720
I'm not gonna be paying for it.

24:08.720 --> 24:09.600
My company's gonna pay for it,

24:09.600 --> 24:10.680
and they don't care if it's two grand

24:10.680 --> 24:11.840
or three grand for the most part.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.440
Yeah, I really don't think it's worth,

24:13.440 --> 24:16.480
I mean, it's worth mentioning the base price

24:16.480 --> 24:18.440
in terms of value to the consumer,

24:18.440 --> 24:22.200
but anybody that's gonna use these tools to make money

24:22.200 --> 24:24.880
is gonna think about the price for about two days,

24:24.880 --> 24:27.040
and then when they get to work and start making revenue

24:27.040 --> 24:29.500
based on their work output from this machine,

24:29.500 --> 24:31.640
they're not gonna care so much that it costs them $3,000

24:31.640 --> 24:32.600
and it's a tax write-off.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.160
So the price is worth discussing,

24:34.160 --> 24:36.580
but it's absolutely not one of the primary issues.

24:36.580 --> 24:37.560
I think hands down,

24:37.560 --> 24:40.080
the primary professional issue here is

24:40.080 --> 24:42.100
no expandability internally,

24:42.100 --> 24:44.540
and these machines only get updated every thousand days,

24:44.540 --> 24:47.960
and the 16 gigabyte RAM limitation

24:47.960 --> 24:52.120
for anybody that's working in 1080p plus video is atrocious.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.240
It is, after effects,

24:55.200 --> 24:57.200
I don't know, unless you've used these tools,

24:57.200 --> 24:59.760
you have to understand that they work

24:59.760 --> 25:02.440
by caching things in RAM.

25:02.440 --> 25:03.840
That's how they are usable,

25:03.840 --> 25:05.520
and you can't work at these resolutions

25:05.520 --> 25:07.320
unless you can cache some of this data in RAM,

25:07.320 --> 25:10.880
and if you don't have RAM, you can't use the machine.

25:10.880 --> 25:15.880
There's actually, the part about the pricing thing,

25:16.360 --> 25:21.240
you gotta point out that Apple has always overcharged

25:21.240 --> 25:22.560
for inferior products,

25:22.560 --> 25:24.520
like them having a higher price.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.440
I don't know if that's totally fair.

25:26.440 --> 25:28.640
I think they start with a base configuration

25:28.640 --> 25:30.440
that's more competitive,

25:30.440 --> 25:32.640
and they don't even bother with a lower end machine,

25:32.640 --> 25:35.640
and then they gouge you on things like RAM and storage a bit.

25:35.640 --> 25:36.480
Yeah.

25:36.480 --> 25:37.300
But I wanna, okay.

25:37.300 --> 25:41.360
You can get every single,

25:41.360 --> 25:43.320
even the MacBook Air when it was out,

25:43.320 --> 25:45.960
you could get his Inbook for the same amount of hardware

25:45.960 --> 25:48.960
for like 300, $400 cheaper.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.040
Yes, but tell me,

25:50.040 --> 25:53.000
how great is ASUS support compared to Apple support?

25:53.000 --> 25:53.880
There's a lot of things.

25:53.880 --> 25:55.680
I mean, there's, yeah.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.520
Apple support is not that good.

25:57.520 --> 25:58.840
Apple support is not that good,

25:58.840 --> 26:00.280
but you can take it into a store,

26:00.280 --> 26:02.400
and they can usually fix your issues there.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.600
ASUS will take at least two months to get back to you.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.040
But again, I don't really wanna get into the,

26:06.040 --> 26:07.680
I don't really wanna get into the price.

26:07.680 --> 26:08.960
I don't wanna get into the price discussion,

26:08.960 --> 26:11.520
because if I'm gonna get a Lenovo laptop or a Dell laptop

26:11.520 --> 26:12.680
that's actually worth me using,

26:12.680 --> 26:14.240
it's also gonna be expensive.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.080
See, I think that's,

26:15.080 --> 26:18.160
I think the price thing is a bit of a misnomer

26:18.160 --> 26:18.980
in this conversation,

26:18.980 --> 26:20.800
because I think you can remove it from the conversation,

26:20.800 --> 26:23.040
and we still have a perfectly viable argument here.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.720
And Popey, I wanted to give you a chance to jump in.

26:25.720 --> 26:27.520
So one of the questions you asked was,

26:27.520 --> 26:30.580
why is it that we hold Apple to a standard

26:30.580 --> 26:33.560
where we complain that they only have 16 gig yet?

26:33.560 --> 26:35.060
All these other manufacturers like Dell

26:35.060 --> 26:38.180
with their XPS 13 and Lenovo with their X1,

26:38.180 --> 26:39.720
they don't get the same kind of flag.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.320
Yeah, they have the similar specs.

26:41.320 --> 26:43.600
And the simple reason is Apple ask for it.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.560
They put themselves up on a pedestal

26:45.560 --> 26:47.880
and do a gigantic PR exercise

26:47.880 --> 26:50.220
to get the whole world watching a live stream

26:50.220 --> 26:51.880
while they announce their products.

26:51.880 --> 26:54.300
And if that doesn't get people critiquing their products,

26:54.300 --> 26:55.740
then I don't know what does.

26:55.740 --> 26:58.340
Dell and Lenovo don't do that.

26:58.340 --> 27:00.140
And so they put out their products,

27:00.140 --> 27:02.020
people buy them, and people move on.

27:02.020 --> 27:05.300
They don't scrutinize the minutiae of those products

27:05.300 --> 27:07.540
anywhere near as much as they do for Apple devices,

27:07.540 --> 27:09.780
because Apple invite that.

27:09.780 --> 27:12.120
So let me tell you about why this matters to me,

27:12.120 --> 27:14.440
because I've spent the last three weeks

27:14.440 --> 27:16.620
trying to exclusively edit segments

27:16.620 --> 27:19.820
for the Linux Action Show in Cadian Live.

27:19.820 --> 27:22.460
And, ooh, will you check that?

27:22.460 --> 27:23.300
I will, yeah.

27:23.300 --> 27:24.120
That might be UPS, thanks, Wes.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.360
The UPS just got here.

27:26.780 --> 27:30.840
And I have mad respect for the work that project is doing,

27:30.840 --> 27:33.940
and I am really happy with their trajectory

27:33.940 --> 27:35.500
on where they wanna go with it.

27:37.180 --> 27:39.460
But it is not, I thought to myself,

27:39.460 --> 27:41.420
it's usable for me when I wanna produce

27:41.420 --> 27:43.660
one 10-minute segment a week.

27:43.660 --> 27:45.900
If I wanted to produce daily video,

27:45.900 --> 27:47.740
or I wanted to move our entire workflow

27:47.740 --> 27:49.900
over to Cadian Live, I still don't think it's,

27:49.900 --> 27:54.220
I think it's still, I think it could be six years out

27:54.220 --> 27:57.260
from where they're even getting close to Final Cut 10.

27:57.260 --> 27:59.040
And the issue is that in the three years

27:59.040 --> 28:02.300
that Apple dropped the Final Cut 10 bomb on the world,

28:02.300 --> 28:05.460
they've progressively made it better and better and better.

28:05.460 --> 28:07.780
And now it's actually a competitive product

28:07.780 --> 28:09.820
that is faster in some regards

28:09.820 --> 28:11.420
than any other editor in the market.

28:11.420 --> 28:13.620
It uses the GPU in a way that most editors

28:13.620 --> 28:16.460
don't even get close, and it is,

28:16.460 --> 28:19.860
the UI is functional, and it's one of these applications

28:19.860 --> 28:21.440
where if you have very little experience,

28:21.440 --> 28:22.460
you can begin to use it,

28:22.460 --> 28:24.340
and then as you grow as a professional,

28:24.340 --> 28:25.900
or as you grow as an editor,

28:25.900 --> 28:27.900
you can learn more ways to take advantage

28:27.900 --> 28:29.740
of this application.

28:29.740 --> 28:31.340
And there is a company, hold on one sec,

28:31.340 --> 28:33.580
there is a company behind it

28:33.580 --> 28:35.960
that is working with the market.

28:35.960 --> 28:37.900
They're working with companies like Canon.

28:37.900 --> 28:40.100
They're working with companies like Blackmagic.

28:40.100 --> 28:43.220
They're creating hard, they're working with partnerships

28:43.220 --> 28:45.380
where they create hardware that works with the product.

28:45.380 --> 28:48.580
And that is something that simply Cadian Live,

28:48.580 --> 28:52.520
or OpenShot, or Shotcut, or any of them,

28:52.520 --> 28:54.180
simply don't have the resource to do.

28:54.180 --> 28:58.180
And last, final point, and this is the really bad one,

28:58.180 --> 29:01.520
is there is a giant pool of talent out there

29:01.520 --> 29:03.180
that knows how to use Final Cut,

29:03.180 --> 29:05.740
and is creating Final Cut professional templates

29:05.740 --> 29:10.740
that look broadcast good, that you can buy for 25, 30 bucks,

29:11.260 --> 29:12.940
and then modify for your own use.

29:12.940 --> 29:15.720
And there's nothing like that for the open source projects

29:15.720 --> 29:18.780
at any scale, at any quality.

29:18.780 --> 29:20.900
And so the fundamental issue is,

29:20.900 --> 29:23.860
and you guys can write it off as Crazy Chris

29:23.860 --> 29:26.140
and his podcast, but the reality is

29:26.140 --> 29:29.380
there is a ginormous market of millions of professionals

29:29.380 --> 29:32.020
and businesses now that produce video content

29:32.020 --> 29:33.580
for this tiny website you may have heard of

29:33.580 --> 29:35.100
called YouTube and many others,

29:35.100 --> 29:37.460
and none of them are doing it under Linux

29:37.460 --> 29:38.820
because these tools are not good enough.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.780
And so people are still gonna be buying Macs.

29:40.780 --> 29:43.100
And this Mac is less Linux friendly

29:43.100 --> 29:45.580
than any Mac Apple has ever shipped.

29:45.580 --> 29:47.820
So it is, the platform is worse,

29:47.820 --> 29:49.580
the people that use these tools are getting locked

29:49.580 --> 29:52.340
into a less and less appealing platform,

29:52.340 --> 29:53.720
and the hardware they are shipping

29:53.720 --> 29:56.020
becomes less and less capable of running Linux.

29:58.660 --> 30:03.660
I just wanted to ask, if you really think Apple's the leader

30:06.500 --> 30:08.660
and everybody else is trying to follow,

30:08.660 --> 30:11.860
or do you think it's the other way around somehow?

30:11.860 --> 30:14.420
I mean, I don't know.

30:14.420 --> 30:17.700
I think they probably just have 15, 20 years experience

30:17.700 --> 30:20.180
making editing software, and they have 15, 20 years

30:20.180 --> 30:22.300
of business relationships to make it a viable editor

30:22.300 --> 30:24.420
for the companies to support.

30:24.420 --> 30:25.660
I think they're kind of experimenting

30:25.660 --> 30:26.760
for the future though.

30:28.300 --> 30:29.460
Go ahead William, what was that?

30:29.460 --> 30:31.840
Yeah, so I think with the whole touchpad thing,

30:31.840 --> 30:33.380
I think eventually what they're going to do

30:33.380 --> 30:36.060
is turn the whole keyboard into just a big LCD panel,

30:36.060 --> 30:37.540
and this is the first step of doing that,

30:37.540 --> 30:39.420
and I think it's kind of an interesting change.

30:39.420 --> 30:40.900
They're experimenting it with the keys

30:40.900 --> 30:42.060
that are less important to you,

30:42.060 --> 30:44.660
so it's not your normal QWERTY alphabet keys,

30:44.660 --> 30:47.340
it's just the F keys which you only use every now and then,

30:47.340 --> 30:49.180
and eventually they're going to expand that downward

30:49.180 --> 30:50.480
into being the whole body.

30:50.480 --> 30:51.320
Maybe.

30:51.320 --> 30:52.160
Maybe?

30:52.160 --> 30:54.520
Okay, Popeye, I wanted to give you a chance to jump in,

30:54.520 --> 30:56.040
and then I'll go to Mohsen Rath.

30:56.040 --> 30:56.860
And then Rath.

30:56.860 --> 30:57.700
All right, that's cool.

30:57.700 --> 30:58.840
Okay, Mohsen Rath, go ahead.

31:00.160 --> 31:03.040
Okay, we had this discussion already,

31:03.040 --> 31:04.560
I think it was like my first or second time

31:04.560 --> 31:08.420
I was graciously allowed to talk on your show there,

31:08.420 --> 31:12.040
about why with your open source argument,

31:12.040 --> 31:13.360
why it is that there's nothing

31:13.360 --> 31:14.680
for the open source argument.

31:14.680 --> 31:15.920
We already had this discussion.

31:15.920 --> 31:18.180
Remember that wishlist of yours?

31:18.180 --> 31:20.960
One of those things is, where all those people go

31:20.960 --> 31:23.240
that crump out, that fail out?

31:23.240 --> 31:25.040
Why is it that they don't just link up,

31:25.040 --> 31:27.440
legion up to one of those open source projects

31:27.440 --> 31:31.920
that is hitting it, that is working out on the same thing?

31:31.920 --> 31:34.600
Where does all that money not go to?

31:34.600 --> 31:36.140
Oh yes, open source.

31:36.140 --> 31:37.440
Where does that money go to?

31:37.440 --> 31:39.960
The people that already are making something.

31:39.960 --> 31:42.680
So remember you were talking about the 15 to 20 years of?

31:42.680 --> 31:46.900
They also have at least, at least 15 to 20 years

31:46.900 --> 31:51.900
of cash in hand, cash invested, cash coming in.

31:52.640 --> 31:54.880
Notice that word that keeps on showing up, cash.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.360
And I say that on purpose because

31:57.360 --> 31:59.120
all those open source projects,

31:59.120 --> 32:00.920
they're going off of donations.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.960
They're going off of people being generous.

32:02.960 --> 32:05.440
They're going off of people doing it for the love of it.

32:05.440 --> 32:07.220
Or some of them are doing it for the hate of it

32:07.220 --> 32:09.140
because they just hate the other products so much.

32:09.140 --> 32:11.660
They're just like, I'm gonna make something

32:11.660 --> 32:12.980
to compare against it.

32:12.980 --> 32:15.240
I'm gonna make something to compete against it.

32:15.240 --> 32:17.800
And until those people,

32:17.800 --> 32:19.360
all those legions of people who are doing

32:19.360 --> 32:23.120
all that hard work, get the same kind of money,

32:23.120 --> 32:24.760
get the same kind of backing,

32:24.760 --> 32:26.560
get the same kind of backup.

32:26.560 --> 32:27.680
And when I'm talking about backup,

32:27.680 --> 32:29.760
I'm talking about those legions upon legions

32:29.760 --> 32:32.280
upon legions of people.

32:32.280 --> 32:34.120
People like, I'm gonna call him out here

32:34.120 --> 32:38.320
because he's awesome, Tilnesh here, who's brilliant.

32:39.160 --> 32:41.340
And he's talked about some of the stuff that he's done.

32:41.340 --> 32:44.560
People like him, people like Rekai, people like yourself,

32:44.560 --> 32:48.520
people like Noah, people like Wes there.

32:48.520 --> 32:50.960
At the same thing, people like Alan

32:50.960 --> 32:52.880
and people like the other Chris.

32:52.880 --> 32:55.400
Without legions of people like them,

32:55.400 --> 32:56.980
not just two, not just five,

32:56.980 --> 33:01.160
we're talking hundreds of people like that

33:01.160 --> 33:04.320
who also have hundreds of thousands of dollars

33:04.320 --> 33:07.940
following them to show up to these projects,

33:07.940 --> 33:10.800
they are not going to be at the same level.

33:10.800 --> 33:13.120
It's not like a sport where you could sit there

33:13.120 --> 33:16.280
and train by yourself and learn the stuff by yourself,

33:16.280 --> 33:18.480
like basketball or football or hockey

33:18.480 --> 33:19.460
or something like that.

33:19.460 --> 33:21.840
Most of those things, you can get yourself

33:21.840 --> 33:23.260
to the state where you need to be

33:23.260 --> 33:25.680
and then it's just a matter of getting the equipment.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.160
It's not like that.

33:27.160 --> 33:30.880
So you gotta remember all the efforts

33:30.880 --> 33:31.980
that all these people are doing,

33:31.980 --> 33:33.360
of course they're gonna be playing catch up.

33:33.360 --> 33:34.800
They're always gonna be playing catch up

33:34.800 --> 33:37.000
until someone gives them the leader position

33:37.000 --> 33:39.360
by literally dumping a ton of people

33:39.360 --> 33:41.520
and a ton of money and a ton of influence

33:41.520 --> 33:43.960
and a ton of equipment in their lap

33:43.960 --> 33:45.560
along with a ton of testers.

33:45.560 --> 33:48.280
I do feel like for the basic editing timeline

33:48.280 --> 33:49.120
and stuff like that,

33:49.120 --> 33:51.300
KDN Live is sitting in a pretty good spot

33:51.300 --> 33:53.120
and they wanna continue focusing on polish.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.640
And so on that note, Rot,

33:54.640 --> 33:56.200
and I wanted to give you the sort of the final word

33:56.200 --> 33:57.180
on the KDN point.

33:58.640 --> 34:01.200
Yeah, I started doing some video tutorials

34:01.200 --> 34:02.200
and stuff for YouTube

34:02.200 --> 34:07.200
and I decided to exclusively use only Linux tools

34:07.200 --> 34:12.200
and I'm using KDN Live for all the editing and everything.

34:13.760 --> 34:17.020
And I disagree that it's not usable,

34:17.020 --> 34:17.860
but I totally agree.

34:17.860 --> 34:19.460
Oh, it's usable, yeah.

34:19.460 --> 34:24.200
I totally agree with your point about how it's very limited

34:24.200 --> 34:28.600
and it's so much so that I experienced a couple crashes

34:28.600 --> 34:30.720
just by trying to do an effect

34:30.720 --> 34:32.940
that I eventually gave up and just,

34:32.940 --> 34:35.980
I created animations in CSS on the web browser.

34:35.980 --> 34:38.240
Yeah, I've done a couple of work around.

34:38.240 --> 34:42.080
So if you watch this most recent segment

34:42.080 --> 34:43.080
on the Linux Action Show

34:43.080 --> 34:44.000
where I go over to Angela's house

34:44.000 --> 34:44.960
and set up Open Media Vault,

34:44.960 --> 34:46.360
that was edited under KDN Live.

34:46.360 --> 34:47.380
Oh, cool, wow.

34:47.380 --> 34:50.120
Yeah, so I mean, I've been using it to success,

34:50.120 --> 34:53.880
but I'm experimenting with ideas for next year

34:53.880 --> 34:55.840
where the output volume needs to go up a lot more.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.120
And so that's where I'm worried about these tools

34:58.120 --> 34:59.080
not being up to that task.

34:59.080 --> 35:02.360
And I am sort of in a position of somewhat privilege

35:02.360 --> 35:03.720
right now thanks to you, Wes,

35:03.720 --> 35:06.120
where you set up Arch Linux on my MacBook.

35:06.120 --> 35:07.040
Oh, right, yeah.

35:07.040 --> 35:09.960
And so if push-pull comes to shove,

35:09.960 --> 35:12.460
I can boot in, I got an older version of macOS on there.

35:12.460 --> 35:14.120
I wonder what happens if I update that to Sierra.

35:14.120 --> 35:15.740
I'm not really compelled to do so,

35:15.740 --> 35:17.060
but I have no idea what would happen.

35:17.060 --> 35:18.960
You think it'd still boot into Arch?

35:18.960 --> 35:22.880
I mean, I imagine it would change the UEFI variable back

35:22.880 --> 35:26.100
so that it would boot into macOS, but you could change that.

35:26.100 --> 35:30.000
And I could boot into macOS, do my final cut thing,

35:30.000 --> 35:31.320
and then boot back into Arch

35:31.320 --> 35:33.360
for like everything I actually wanna do.

35:33.360 --> 35:37.880
And so I don't have to have a solution today,

35:37.880 --> 35:40.160
and I can continue to try to use KDE Live,

35:40.160 --> 35:41.560
but on the same hardware,

35:41.560 --> 35:43.240
because I'm just dual booting,

35:43.240 --> 35:47.600
there is a 20x speed improvement under Final Cut

35:47.600 --> 35:48.680
than there is under KDE Live.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.280
And it's just where it is right now.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.280
I do wanna make one more point.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.560
Technically, if you look at the track record

35:54.560 --> 35:56.220
of development for KDE Live,

35:56.220 --> 35:58.480
they were not working on KDE Live for like two

35:58.480 --> 35:59.320
or three years.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.320
They would like do a little bug phase here and there.

36:01.320 --> 36:03.400
For the past six, seven months or so,

36:03.400 --> 36:05.760
they have made incredible strides.

36:05.760 --> 36:09.480
Like they have fixed most of the crashing bugs

36:09.480 --> 36:10.840
on most issues,

36:10.840 --> 36:14.040
and the stability is like astronomically better

36:14.040 --> 36:15.120
than what it used to be.

36:15.120 --> 36:19.320
So I think by far, KDE Live is the best free editor

36:19.320 --> 36:21.120
on any platform.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.120
Yeah, I would say it's better

36:23.120 --> 36:25.120
than even Lightworks and everything.

36:25.120 --> 36:25.960
Yeah, I agree.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.640
And I've been really impressed with how well it's done.

36:27.640 --> 36:29.680
That's kind of why I wanted to give it

36:29.680 --> 36:30.680
some try the last few weeks.

36:30.680 --> 36:34.240
But one last thing before we move off of the new MacBooks,

36:34.240 --> 36:35.920
just as you might expect,

36:35.920 --> 36:38.960
there is already a fart app for the new Touch Bar.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.000
It's called Touch Fart,

36:40.000 --> 36:41.800
and it's right there.

36:41.800 --> 36:42.640
You run it.

36:42.640 --> 36:43.640
Three different fart sounds.

36:43.640 --> 36:44.460
Yep, yep.

36:44.460 --> 36:47.080
And the two emoji and one word that say fart.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.920
So it works with Touch Fart macOS app

36:48.920 --> 36:50.740
to allow a selection of playbacks

36:50.740 --> 36:52.180
and predefined fart sounds.

36:53.260 --> 36:54.200
Right there on the Touch Bar.

36:54.200 --> 36:55.840
Told you it's useful, Wes.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.060
Who needs an escape button?

36:57.060 --> 36:57.900
Yeah, right?

36:57.900 --> 36:59.240
Just keep using that on hearts.

36:59.240 --> 37:02.000
All you need is a fart bar and a headphone jack.

37:02.000 --> 37:02.840
You're good.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.800
Yeah, I wonder, does it,

37:04.800 --> 37:06.200
huh, too bad they don't have any preview.

37:06.200 --> 37:07.760
Sorry, guys, I can't preview for you.

37:07.760 --> 37:09.200
I think that fart bar will pair well

37:09.200 --> 37:10.640
with the Cloud to Butt extension.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.000
Ha ha ha ha!

37:12.000 --> 37:12.840
Yes, Wes.

37:12.840 --> 37:15.220
Well said, well said.

37:15.220 --> 37:16.820
Speaking of the cloud,

37:16.820 --> 37:18.160
let's talk about DigitalOcean.

37:18.160 --> 37:19.240
DigitalOcean.com.

37:19.240 --> 37:22.000
Go build your own cloud over at DigitalOcean.com

37:22.000 --> 37:23.660
and use our promo code.

37:23.660 --> 37:24.800
Did you know we have a promo code, Wes?

37:24.800 --> 37:25.640
It's D-O-Unplugged.

37:25.640 --> 37:26.460
Do you know that?

37:26.460 --> 37:27.300
D-O-Unplugged.

37:27.300 --> 37:28.120
It's new, it's brand new.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.360
Brand new promo code, D-O, not really.

37:29.360 --> 37:30.520
Be the first to use it.

37:30.520 --> 37:31.360
Yeah.

37:31.360 --> 37:32.280
D-O-Unplugged, one word, lowercase.

37:32.280 --> 37:34.280
I'll give you a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean.com

37:34.280 --> 37:36.520
and you can go spin up a droplet in seconds.

37:36.520 --> 37:37.700
And they have data centers in New York,

37:37.700 --> 37:39.240
San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

37:39.240 --> 37:42.440
London, Toronto, Germany, India.

37:42.440 --> 37:43.800
And you can either do a monthly plan,

37:43.800 --> 37:45.300
like they start at like five bucks a month,

37:45.300 --> 37:46.720
or you can do their hourly pricing.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.540
I love their three cents an hour rig.

37:48.540 --> 37:50.260
They have a simple, intuitive interface

37:50.260 --> 37:52.160
and a really nice, straightforward API

37:52.160 --> 37:55.400
that's really well supported by the community.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.060
You can really just probably take advantage

37:57.060 --> 37:58.160
of the code already written.

37:58.160 --> 37:59.500
Or you could quickly bang something out

37:59.500 --> 38:00.960
because the API's well documented.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.520
And man, speaking of documentation,

38:02.520 --> 38:05.520
they got tons of good documentation over at DigitalOcean.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.080
You'll be impressed in the community section.

38:07.080 --> 38:10.920
There's a how-to up that was posted just three hours ago

38:10.920 --> 38:13.840
on how to configure Nextcloud on Open21604.

38:13.840 --> 38:14.680
Wow.

38:14.680 --> 38:16.720
Yeah, so you can go build your own cloud

38:16.720 --> 38:19.540
over on DigitalOcean with Nextcloud.

38:19.540 --> 38:21.680
It's such a neat, like, symbiotic relationship

38:21.680 --> 38:24.280
between the open source community and D-O.

38:24.280 --> 38:25.920
Yeah, yeah, and I like that they work

38:25.920 --> 38:28.440
with the upstream projects, like the different distros

38:28.440 --> 38:30.040
and even FreeBSD that they have on the systems.

38:30.040 --> 38:30.860
That's really cool.

38:30.860 --> 38:32.680
It's in D-O's interest to let you run whatever you want.

38:32.680 --> 38:34.000
Like, that's what they're there for

38:34.000 --> 38:34.840
and they're great at it.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.200
You wanna go kick the tires on something

38:36.200 --> 38:38.760
or throw it in production, go to DigitalOcean.com

38:38.760 --> 38:40.520
and use our promo code D-O Unplugged

38:40.520 --> 38:41.700
and a big thanks to DigitalOcean

38:41.700 --> 38:44.300
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

38:44.300 --> 38:46.960
Okay, guys, you know I'm always looking

38:46.960 --> 38:49.640
for something to replace the Chromecast and the Roku.

38:49.640 --> 38:51.960
And your Amazon stick, Chris.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.940
I do have a fire here at the studio and I hate it.

38:53.940 --> 38:55.120
I'm sorry, fire lovers.

38:55.120 --> 38:57.000
I don't, I got it and I hate it.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.020
But you know what else?

38:58.020 --> 39:02.080
I would love to eventually replace my Shield TV.

39:02.080 --> 39:05.440
I had an upgrade, big props to Nvidia.

39:05.440 --> 39:07.000
They ship monthly updates to this thing

39:07.000 --> 39:08.860
so you get the monthly Android updates.

39:08.860 --> 39:10.080
Can I use it as a phone?

39:10.080 --> 39:11.240
I know, right?

39:11.240 --> 39:13.500
And so I installed the latest update

39:13.500 --> 39:16.280
and it began rebooting every three minutes.

39:16.280 --> 39:17.120
Yikes.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.200
And I thought I was in a bad situation.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.960
So I had to do like a mad dash on install applications,

39:21.960 --> 39:23.840
which turns out for some reason on Android TV,

39:23.840 --> 39:26.600
if you go into the Android mechanism

39:26.600 --> 39:28.640
inside the system settings to uninstall applications,

39:28.640 --> 39:30.200
it doesn't uninstall the application.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.060
No, you have to go through the Play Store.

39:32.060 --> 39:33.040
So I went through the Play Store,

39:33.040 --> 39:34.600
found each application, uninstalled them,

39:34.600 --> 39:36.680
and then it finally stopped rebooting.

39:36.680 --> 39:38.120
And even though I love the Shield TV,

39:38.120 --> 39:40.480
it's the best set top box I've ever had,

39:40.480 --> 39:42.720
it sort of made me look for something else

39:42.720 --> 39:45.340
because for a good solid 25 minutes,

39:45.340 --> 39:47.820
I gotta explain, it's the weekend.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.200
It is the Pacific Northwest.

39:49.200 --> 39:50.400
Precious relaxation time.

39:50.400 --> 39:52.240
It was pouring down rain outside.

39:52.240 --> 39:54.160
It was miserable.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.360
Slash beautiful.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.240
Yeah, at times it was like also like

39:57.240 --> 39:58.440
right as I needed to go trick or treating.

39:58.440 --> 39:59.880
So kids went trick or treating on Saturday

39:59.880 --> 40:01.600
and about a half hour before they went trick or treating,

40:01.600 --> 40:02.540
it stopped raining.

40:02.540 --> 40:03.380
Nice.

40:03.380 --> 40:04.540
And I was like, this is perfect.

40:04.540 --> 40:06.760
But earlier in the morning at about like 10 a.m.,

40:06.760 --> 40:08.400
it was miserable outside.

40:08.400 --> 40:09.720
And I'm like, okay, let's watch a movie.

40:09.720 --> 40:10.720
Well, watch a movie.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.160
And dad goes to start a movie

40:12.160 --> 40:13.540
and it starts rebooting all the time.

40:13.540 --> 40:17.000
And there is nothing worse as a father

40:17.000 --> 40:19.240
when you go to like, here children,

40:19.240 --> 40:20.680
here's the media system I've set up

40:20.680 --> 40:23.600
powered by all these fancy things that I've figured out.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.240
And I've got this movie on demand.

40:25.240 --> 40:26.400
Oh, what?

40:26.400 --> 40:27.640
And it reboots.

40:27.640 --> 40:28.480
And dad.

40:28.480 --> 40:29.320
And then you're sitting there like,

40:29.320 --> 40:30.800
oh, just a second, just a second, I'll fix it.

40:30.800 --> 40:31.760
Yeah, yeah.

40:31.760 --> 40:34.560
So that got me looking at Remix.io,

40:34.560 --> 40:38.420
a nougat-powered all-in-one 4K device

40:38.420 --> 40:40.300
that you hook up to your television.

40:40.300 --> 40:41.560
You know your television, Wes,

40:41.560 --> 40:43.720
where you have the Android Shield TV hooked up right now?

40:43.720 --> 40:44.560
That's right.

40:44.560 --> 40:45.480
You maybe hook this up instead.

40:45.480 --> 40:46.760
It's something that's on Kickstarter.

40:46.760 --> 40:49.440
It's got 3,960 backers.

40:49.440 --> 40:53.080
17 days to go, they had a goal of $250,000.

40:53.080 --> 40:55.240
And holy smokes, they've already blown past that.

40:55.240 --> 40:56.080
Woo!

40:57.520 --> 41:00.360
And they're at $484,000.

41:00.360 --> 41:03.360
["Danger is Better"]

41:12.000 --> 41:13.720
I hope this doesn't get us pulled down.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.240
But you can probably guess what they're doing right now.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.580
Danger is better.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.200
Whatever.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.320
I know how a TV works.

41:21.320 --> 41:24.680
Yeah, but can your TV do this?

41:24.680 --> 41:26.960
Clashing my clans in one click.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.980
So what do you think of a UI on your television

41:32.980 --> 41:34.480
that uses a mouse and keyboard?

41:36.080 --> 41:40.160
I have mixed feelings, at least about wider applicability.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.200
But you know, maybe you get one of those

41:41.200 --> 41:43.400
little Logitech wireless ones with the built-in trackpad.

41:43.400 --> 41:44.240
Or it includes its own.

41:44.240 --> 41:46.520
Let's just say it comes with a nice wireless keyboard,

41:46.520 --> 41:49.440
mouse set up, maybe a remote combo.

41:49.440 --> 41:50.840
And this is a little Android box,

41:50.840 --> 41:53.080
you set it up on your television,

41:53.080 --> 41:55.680
and you can play, you know, you can play,

41:55.680 --> 41:58.440
Android, a mouse works surprisingly well with Android.

41:58.440 --> 42:00.640
It's like they intended it to have a mouse.

42:01.680 --> 42:02.520
Would you, no?

42:02.520 --> 42:03.680
You instantly don't like it?

42:03.680 --> 42:04.500
You wouldn't do it?

42:04.500 --> 42:05.340
No, I think I would.

42:05.340 --> 42:09.040
I mean, I have a Upadubat Mate box running on a TV,

42:09.040 --> 42:10.740
so I think I'm open to it.

42:10.740 --> 42:11.920
Honestly, it might be my preferred way.

42:11.920 --> 42:12.760
I think I would still like.

42:12.760 --> 42:13.780
You know how many people email me and say,

42:13.780 --> 42:17.000
my media center is VLC hooked up to my PC?

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
Right, for me it's Kodi, but same thing, yeah.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.320
And this is by the same people

42:21.320 --> 42:22.960
who do the Remix OS, right?

42:22.960 --> 42:25.200
Yes, and remind me, Remix OS.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.560
That's the Android Spin 4 x86.

42:27.560 --> 42:29.280
Yeah, the one that we've actually, I think,

42:29.280 --> 42:31.280
featured as a, I don't know if we've reviewed it

42:31.280 --> 42:32.600
on this show or we featured it on last,

42:32.600 --> 42:34.240
but we talked about it not too long ago.

42:34.240 --> 42:37.400
I think I even have it on the USB stick still floating around.

42:37.400 --> 42:39.400
So they got the Remix IO, which is 99 bucks,

42:39.400 --> 42:41.560
a 4K TV box, an Android game console,

42:41.560 --> 42:44.480
and then they have the Remix IO Plus, $130,

42:44.480 --> 42:47.800
a performance beast to bring out the potential of your TV.

42:47.800 --> 42:48.640
What the?

42:49.960 --> 42:52.040
So is this running on an ARM board?

42:52.040 --> 42:54.240
Do we know, is it x86?

42:54.240 --> 42:56.000
How do I get the potential out of my TV?

42:56.000 --> 42:57.080
Is that what you're asking?

42:57.080 --> 42:59.760
Yeah, it is a ARM processor, yeah.

42:59.760 --> 43:02.200
The RK399 with four gigs of RAM.

43:02.200 --> 43:03.800
Okay, four gigs, that doesn't sound bad.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.520
No, not bad, no fans either, they say,

43:05.520 --> 43:07.460
so that's kind of nice.

43:07.460 --> 43:08.300
I'm gonna take that.

43:08.300 --> 43:09.120
What do you think?

43:09.120 --> 43:12.680
Does the Mumba Room have any thoughts on this thing?

43:12.680 --> 43:15.240
I remember that Popey talked about the license

43:15.240 --> 43:18.480
of Remix OS when we talked about Remix OS the first time.

43:18.480 --> 43:19.400
Oh, can you remind me?

43:19.400 --> 43:20.720
I don't recall.

43:21.800 --> 43:22.640
Did I?

43:22.640 --> 43:25.760
I think you, in fact, you're giving China access

43:25.760 --> 43:27.200
to your computer, I think.

43:28.280 --> 43:29.920
That sounds like Popey.

43:29.920 --> 43:30.800
Don't think that was me.

43:30.800 --> 43:32.220
He hates the Chiners.

43:32.220 --> 43:35.600
I remember hearing they were completely ignoring

43:35.600 --> 43:37.300
the TPL in some cases.

43:37.300 --> 43:40.480
Yeah, it's been claimed that they've violated

43:40.480 --> 43:42.520
the GPL and Apache licenses, yes.

43:42.520 --> 43:44.960
We're about to get to that topic, as a matter of fact,

43:44.960 --> 43:45.860
in a little bit.

43:46.840 --> 43:48.440
Oh, you guys in the Mumba Room,

43:48.440 --> 43:49.840
you know why I'm covering this.

43:49.840 --> 43:51.800
I've been desperate to replace the Chromecast,

43:51.800 --> 43:55.240
and I would love to have something that is usable,

43:55.240 --> 43:57.720
that has actual useful streaming apps like Netflix

43:57.720 --> 44:00.120
and Hulu on it, or whatever it is, whatever,

44:01.860 --> 44:03.520
on a device that I can hook up to my television,

44:03.520 --> 44:05.660
and honestly, I'd like to be able to buy a couple of them.

44:05.660 --> 44:07.520
I'd like it to be something that's a product.

44:07.520 --> 44:08.760
Yeah, affordable enough, something that you can,

44:08.760 --> 44:10.400
you don't have to build it yourself.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.480
And it can run Kodi.

44:12.800 --> 44:15.320
It has to run Kodi, is that a requirement?

44:15.320 --> 44:17.240
Well, I think, I think so.

44:17.240 --> 44:18.840
Because, like, is the Roku not good enough?

44:18.840 --> 44:20.240
Just curious, because I was actually thinking

44:20.240 --> 44:21.680
about going the Roku route.

44:21.680 --> 44:24.240
If you want to use Plex, the Roku's good enough.

44:25.440 --> 44:27.760
The Plex app has gotten, just in the last six months,

44:27.760 --> 44:29.480
nine months, the Plex app has gotten pretty good

44:29.480 --> 44:30.320
on the Roku.

44:31.200 --> 44:33.440
But if you want to use Kodi, and I honestly feel

44:33.440 --> 44:34.280
like Kodi is a better experience.

44:34.280 --> 44:35.920
Do you really care what the hardware is?

44:35.920 --> 44:38.340
No, I don't so much, as long as it's something

44:38.340 --> 44:39.180
that is sustainable.

44:39.180 --> 44:40.400
Are you more interested in the software

44:40.400 --> 44:41.600
that's running on it?

44:41.600 --> 44:44.840
I am more interested in having access to Kodi and Netflix.

44:44.840 --> 44:46.640
The software, like Kodi and Plex and stuff?

44:46.640 --> 44:48.440
Yeah, and Netflix, yeah.

44:48.440 --> 44:50.040
That's really true, and I want something

44:50.040 --> 44:52.360
that I can plug in, and God, I would just love

44:52.360 --> 44:55.280
to not have to worry about it for three or four years.

44:55.280 --> 44:56.560
Like, I would love something that I could run

44:56.560 --> 44:57.560
for three or four years.

44:57.560 --> 45:00.060
Something that, like, had the notion to support

45:00.060 --> 45:01.680
the open source stacks that you're gonna run,

45:01.680 --> 45:04.500
but could also interface with the proprietary stuff,

45:04.500 --> 45:06.040
and was an appliance.

45:06.040 --> 45:09.280
Yeah, yeah, Roku looks awesome for, you know,

45:09.280 --> 45:10.120
the price in which you get it.

45:10.120 --> 45:12.040
It's the kind of thing I'd like as well, yeah.

45:12.040 --> 45:14.160
What are you doing right now?

45:14.160 --> 45:17.360
Do you have a Roku, or do you have a device like it?

45:17.360 --> 45:18.760
Uh, Chromecast.

45:18.760 --> 45:22.580
No, it's all Chromecast here, but I would like something

45:22.580 --> 45:24.880
that I could install on.

45:24.880 --> 45:26.680
So anytime you want to watch something on the TV,

45:26.680 --> 45:28.480
you're using your phone to cast it?

45:29.680 --> 45:31.320
Or a computer.

45:31.320 --> 45:33.000
Hmm, that's a lot of work.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.240
That's how we do it here in the studio, too,

45:34.240 --> 45:36.640
and it's just, it's a lot of work.

45:36.640 --> 45:38.200
And it doesn't always, like, sometimes the phone

45:38.200 --> 45:40.160
loses connection with the playback control,

45:40.160 --> 45:41.440
and that's really frustrating.

45:41.440 --> 45:42.720
YouTube in particular?

45:42.720 --> 45:45.320
Yeah, which just doesn't make any sense.

45:46.680 --> 45:48.480
Or you, like, get the volume, and then you can't,

45:48.480 --> 45:50.160
the volume's all offset, yeah.

45:50.160 --> 45:52.600
The other thing, too, is if you don't have an Android TV,

45:52.600 --> 45:53.760
and you haven't experienced this,

45:53.760 --> 45:56.880
the YouTube app on Android TV is actually really good.

45:56.880 --> 45:57.720
Really?

45:57.720 --> 45:59.360
It's my favorite YouTube experience.

45:59.360 --> 46:01.100
It's way better than on the desktop.

46:01.100 --> 46:03.480
I feel like it surfaces more interesting videos

46:03.480 --> 46:05.240
than the desktop does, and it displays them in a way

46:05.240 --> 46:07.280
that's easier for me to see them.

46:07.280 --> 46:08.920
Playback is phenomenal.

46:08.920 --> 46:10.840
You don't get comments, you can't click on, like,

46:10.840 --> 46:12.600
when people say, like, click this link or something.

46:12.600 --> 46:14.360
Oh, it doesn't support the annotations

46:14.360 --> 46:17.200
or anything like that, but for just playback

46:17.200 --> 46:20.000
and the way it buffers really intelligently,

46:20.000 --> 46:23.080
and it auto-scales the resolution perfectly,

46:23.080 --> 46:25.880
which, trust me, I'm working on MiFi here.

46:25.880 --> 46:27.600
It really does a good job.

46:27.600 --> 46:28.920
240p is your best friend.

46:28.920 --> 46:31.520
Since I've gotten the Shield TV,

46:31.520 --> 46:34.720
it has transformed my television watching to,

46:35.640 --> 46:38.080
I have stopped watching traditional television.

46:38.080 --> 46:39.680
Like, I only got to season one of Mr. Robot,

46:39.680 --> 46:40.520
and I stopped watching.

46:40.520 --> 46:41.720
Yeah, me too.

46:41.720 --> 46:44.080
Because I'm watching everything on YouTube now.

46:45.280 --> 46:48.520
It's really kind of fun, because I'm getting

46:48.520 --> 46:51.400
what feels like much more real, genuine content.

46:51.400 --> 46:53.520
Yeah, exactly, and it has, thankfully,

46:53.520 --> 46:56.120
pretty good Linux support and interface, too.

46:56.120 --> 46:57.640
Yeah, and so we'll see, we'll see.

46:57.640 --> 46:59.840
I'm on a mission to eventually,

46:59.840 --> 47:02.380
I would like that set-top box that I could get

47:02.380 --> 47:04.320
for family members for Christmas,

47:04.320 --> 47:05.560
or I could get for myself.

47:05.560 --> 47:08.040
The Shield TV is very expensive,

47:08.040 --> 47:12.240
and it feels like it's not Nvidia's even top three priority,

47:12.240 --> 47:14.400
so like, when's my long term?

47:14.400 --> 47:15.640
Am I gonna get three years out of this?

47:15.640 --> 47:19.520
Right, they could drop that, shift, whatever, anytime.

47:19.520 --> 47:22.880
It is a good demonstration of their chipset platform,

47:22.880 --> 47:25.880
so from that perspective, it's particularly fun,

47:25.880 --> 47:27.800
because there are some great games on there.

47:27.800 --> 47:31.920
It has sort of a console-like experience.

47:31.920 --> 47:34.800
It's a tuned, complete little package, right?

47:34.800 --> 47:37.560
But you know what I kind of fantasize about

47:37.560 --> 47:41.720
is like a Intel NUC type thing, but with a real GPU,

47:41.720 --> 47:45.480
running Steam OS with Kodi included in it,

47:45.480 --> 47:49.080
so like, it's Steam OS, but it's primarily a Kodi box,

47:49.080 --> 47:52.900
that in Kodi, there's like a Steam OS option,

47:52.900 --> 47:53.740
like you don't have movies and TV.

47:53.740 --> 47:55.440
Oh, like a Kodi plug-in to list your games

47:55.440 --> 47:56.280
and then watch them.

47:56.280 --> 47:58.000
And then it flips over to a Steam OS desktop,

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
which is running big picture mode or something like that.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.520
Maybe it's even like X on another...

48:01.520 --> 48:03.120
Yeah, yeah, on another TTY or something,

48:03.120 --> 48:06.240
and it's like its own dedicated big picture mode,

48:06.240 --> 48:08.760
and then I've got a full-fledged Steam OS machine,

48:08.760 --> 48:10.920
and then if there was some sort of in menu,

48:10.920 --> 48:12.880
I could flip back to the Kodi experience,

48:12.880 --> 48:15.760
and now I have a multimedia machine.

48:15.760 --> 48:18.360
Even if it's gotta be like a little PC, I would love to have...

48:18.360 --> 48:19.200
That would be amazing.

48:19.200 --> 48:21.520
That's what I want, and I want it to run Steam OS,

48:21.520 --> 48:23.200
because then it's more of a Linux box,

48:23.200 --> 48:25.360
and I can play the games I really like.

48:25.360 --> 48:26.640
See, the one thing here...

48:26.640 --> 48:27.480
Oh, go on.

48:27.480 --> 48:28.840
You wouldn't want it to run Steam OS at the moment

48:28.840 --> 48:31.320
because it's just broken and crashes.

48:31.320 --> 48:32.320
Oh, well, okay.

48:32.320 --> 48:34.560
But the caveat, the Steam OS isn't sucking at the time.

48:34.560 --> 48:36.900
Okay, one of the better runtimes for Steam

48:36.900 --> 48:38.720
and then the Steam games.

48:38.720 --> 48:40.440
See, I think the caveat for me is I kind of enjoy

48:40.440 --> 48:42.400
some of the Chromecast that I can sit

48:42.400 --> 48:43.960
and then queue something up easily.

48:43.960 --> 48:45.200
That is nice about Android TV.

48:45.200 --> 48:47.280
I'd like them to build the Chromecast stuff into Shield.

48:47.280 --> 48:48.400
Yeah, or if there's...

48:48.400 --> 48:49.240
I know I've seen a couple, like...

48:49.240 --> 48:50.060
The Shield has it.

48:50.060 --> 48:50.900
I've been to Steam OS.

48:50.900 --> 48:52.600
That's a nice thing, too, is...

48:52.600 --> 48:55.100
Yeah, you still have that functionality with Android TV,

48:55.100 --> 48:55.940
is that...

48:55.940 --> 48:58.280
Yeah, and so I think I've seen a couple

48:58.280 --> 49:00.640
attempted open source type replacements,

49:00.640 --> 49:02.660
or even something where you could take a link

49:02.660 --> 49:04.340
and then get a plugin that could go like,

49:04.340 --> 49:06.600
hey, send this to my Kodi box and play that,

49:06.600 --> 49:09.440
play the link from YouTube with YouTube DL.

49:09.440 --> 49:10.360
Michael's working on that.

49:10.360 --> 49:12.580
Yeah, go, tell him about it.

49:13.480 --> 49:17.380
Yeah, it's a cast, spelled with a K, for Kodi,

49:17.380 --> 49:19.520
and it's basically exactly that.

49:19.520 --> 49:22.000
It's more of a plugin structure like you just mentioned

49:22.000 --> 49:24.240
where you tell it a URL,

49:24.240 --> 49:28.040
and then the plugin figures out what add-on

49:28.040 --> 49:29.400
and what player in Kodi.

49:29.400 --> 49:30.520
Ooh, that sounds beautiful.

49:30.520 --> 49:32.560
Kodi already does that using the core app.

49:33.740 --> 49:34.940
No, that's just on the phone.

49:34.940 --> 49:36.920
That doesn't work on the desktop,

49:36.920 --> 49:41.040
so you can't send the information on your desktop.

49:41.040 --> 49:42.560
Yeah, it only works on your phone,

49:42.560 --> 49:45.960
so the core app is fantastic for the solution on the phone,

49:45.960 --> 49:49.380
but it doesn't support every single plugin structure,

49:49.380 --> 49:53.640
so I'm gonna try to submit some of my code to the core app

49:53.640 --> 49:57.200
so they can fix the arbitrary add-ons

49:57.200 --> 49:59.440
that are not necessarily common,

49:59.440 --> 50:02.680
and then that's basically the idea,

50:02.680 --> 50:04.680
is just to take the casting idea

50:04.680 --> 50:07.560
and put it to the improved core

50:07.560 --> 50:10.600
and also make a laptop version so you can just,

50:10.600 --> 50:14.000
my version actually works with local files

50:14.000 --> 50:15.360
on your computer as well.

50:15.360 --> 50:17.120
Oh, that is slick.

50:17.120 --> 50:19.560
I'm gonna check that out tonight.

50:19.560 --> 50:22.320
Yeah, that is, yeah, I love Kodi.

50:22.320 --> 50:23.720
I just love it so much.

50:23.720 --> 50:24.960
It's come so far.

50:24.960 --> 50:25.800
I got the...

50:25.800 --> 50:28.720
Mine uses Samba for the local stuff,

50:28.720 --> 50:30.320
and it's going to use NFS as well.

50:30.320 --> 50:31.320
Nice.

50:31.320 --> 50:33.800
I've been really, it's such a simple, obvious plugin,

50:33.800 --> 50:34.780
and I forget what it's called.

50:34.780 --> 50:35.960
I've mentioned the name before, though,

50:35.960 --> 50:37.940
so it is linked somewhere in the JB site.

50:37.940 --> 50:40.520
It is just the dumbest extension or plugin

50:40.520 --> 50:42.000
or whatever you call it on Kodi

50:42.000 --> 50:45.040
that just plays the next file in order,

50:45.040 --> 50:46.440
like Netflix does when you get to the end

50:46.440 --> 50:49.000
of a Netflix episode, it autoplays the next episode.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.080
This just auto, so if you're watching DuckTales

50:51.080 --> 50:52.640
and you got two seasons of DuckTales

50:52.640 --> 50:54.000
and you're on season one.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.480
You know what you're doing for the next 12 hours.

50:55.480 --> 50:56.760
Yeah, you got automatic DuckTales.

50:56.760 --> 50:57.600
Yeah, right?

50:57.600 --> 50:59.780
And so that's, I love that feature.

50:59.780 --> 51:01.520
I love it because I can just sit back

51:01.520 --> 51:03.600
and I don't have to look for the remote.

51:03.600 --> 51:05.720
I just, it's nice to be able to modify it

51:05.720 --> 51:08.360
in a way that feels like it's genuinely my setup.

51:08.360 --> 51:10.040
I also, I want to encourage you

51:10.040 --> 51:11.520
to make something also feel like your own,

51:11.520 --> 51:15.360
and that's your education, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

51:15.360 --> 51:18.200
Linux Academy just announced another round of funding.

51:18.200 --> 51:19.920
Huge congrats. What?

51:19.920 --> 51:21.160
That's great. Yeah.

51:21.160 --> 51:23.280
Every time they do this, they invest deeply

51:23.280 --> 51:26.120
into Linux Academy content, and they get staff on board

51:26.120 --> 51:28.320
to make sure old content stays relevant.

51:28.320 --> 51:30.160
They get new staff to write the good stuff

51:30.160 --> 51:31.920
that you've been looking for with products

51:31.920 --> 51:33.280
that are exploding right now.

51:33.280 --> 51:34.600
They have research and development.

51:34.600 --> 51:36.360
Of course, they even have instructors

51:36.360 --> 51:38.800
that you can access to get real mentoring

51:38.800 --> 51:41.720
from a human being, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

51:41.720 --> 51:43.320
Hands-on, scenario-based labs

51:43.320 --> 51:45.280
that give you real-world experience.

51:45.280 --> 51:47.240
You get to SSH into the server and own it

51:47.240 --> 51:49.560
and bang around and alter the distro

51:49.560 --> 51:50.520
based on your preference,

51:50.520 --> 51:52.360
so that way you can learn on the distro you need.

51:52.360 --> 51:53.360
You can prepare for a cert

51:53.360 --> 51:55.360
using their practice exams and quizzes,

51:55.360 --> 51:57.280
and I think one of the things that I like

51:57.280 --> 51:59.240
is these features that we're introducing

51:59.240 --> 52:00.360
that involve the community.

52:00.360 --> 52:02.080
First of all, I like that the community

52:02.080 --> 52:04.200
is stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members,

52:04.200 --> 52:06.480
but they have these custom randomized decks of cards

52:06.480 --> 52:07.680
where you can study and practice,

52:07.680 --> 52:09.960
and these cards can be forked by community members

52:09.960 --> 52:12.400
and improved upon, kind of like an open-source project.

52:12.400 --> 52:13.920
Another thing they've recently introduced

52:13.920 --> 52:16.480
is public profiles, so you can brag

52:16.480 --> 52:19.040
or demonstrate the hard work you've been doing

52:19.040 --> 52:20.240
at Linux Academy.

52:20.240 --> 52:22.160
They've got also courses if you wanna get your search

52:22.160 --> 52:24.080
and new iOS and Android apps.

52:24.080 --> 52:25.680
They're busting out new stuff all the time,

52:25.680 --> 52:27.720
and now they just secured another round of funding.

52:27.720 --> 52:28.560
It's just gonna get better.

52:28.560 --> 52:29.600
It's gonna keep going.

52:29.600 --> 52:34.600
They've recently also launched seven-day free trials.

52:35.720 --> 52:36.560
Free?

52:36.560 --> 52:39.200
Seven-day free trials, so you can go get a little taste

52:39.200 --> 52:41.840
over at Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged,

52:41.840 --> 52:43.840
and a big thank you to Linux Academy

52:43.840 --> 52:45.520
for sponsoring the unplugged program.

52:45.520 --> 52:49.240
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

52:49.240 --> 52:50.680
That was my Fox News swish.

52:50.680 --> 52:51.520
Did that work?

52:51.520 --> 52:52.520
I think it landed.

52:52.520 --> 52:53.360
It's...

52:53.360 --> 52:54.240
I'm just gonna say that regardless.

52:54.240 --> 52:55.080
It's supposed to sound...

52:55.080 --> 52:55.920
No one tell him otherwise.

52:55.920 --> 52:57.280
It's supposed to sound a little bit like this.

52:57.280 --> 53:02.280
Speaking of breaking news,

53:02.280 --> 53:03.920
this happened a couple of weeks ago,

53:03.920 --> 53:06.760
but we just got the audio and video online this week.

53:06.760 --> 53:10.080
Linux maintainer, Greg Kh, he supports the LTS kernel,

53:10.080 --> 53:12.880
the USB subsystem, and a bunch of other subsystems

53:12.880 --> 53:15.200
that are absolutely essential to the function

53:15.200 --> 53:16.680
of your Linux box, and he's been around

53:16.680 --> 53:19.160
in Linux development since, well, forever,

53:19.160 --> 53:22.360
and he was at a Linux Foundation event,

53:22.360 --> 53:24.120
and he was doing a fireside chat.

53:24.120 --> 53:25.000
Ooh, did you hear the bombing?

53:25.000 --> 53:25.840
We have a bomber plane.

53:25.840 --> 53:26.660
Oh no.

53:26.660 --> 53:27.500
Duck and cover everybody.

53:27.500 --> 53:28.600
They knew we were about to talk about this.

53:28.600 --> 53:29.640
They knew this was coming,

53:29.640 --> 53:31.880
and he had a couple of choice quotes.

53:31.880 --> 53:33.640
We were just talking about licensing

53:33.640 --> 53:35.000
and other things like that,

53:35.000 --> 53:37.520
and I wanted to kind of jump in on some of this,

53:37.520 --> 53:40.120
but let's start with an interesting stat.

53:40.120 --> 53:41.800
Do you have a rough guess, Wes,

53:41.800 --> 53:45.160
how many people join the Linux kernel development team

53:45.160 --> 53:46.420
per month?

53:46.420 --> 53:47.260
Man, I have no idea.

53:47.260 --> 53:49.560
Let's go with 10.

53:49.560 --> 53:50.480
Okay, that's a good, that's what,

53:50.480 --> 53:51.320
I would probably would've,

53:51.320 --> 53:54.360
I actually would've guessed like four,

53:54.360 --> 53:56.160
because it seems like a pretty tight-knit team, right?

53:56.160 --> 53:57.760
I would've guessed like four.

53:57.760 --> 53:59.920
Greg actually shares the number with us,

53:59.920 --> 54:03.120
and it turns out, Wes, it's a bit larger.

54:03.120 --> 54:03.960
Freshman.

54:03.960 --> 54:05.920
But we have high school students working on the kernel,

54:05.920 --> 54:08.160
so, yeah, but I mean, there's always new people,

54:08.160 --> 54:11.180
our community, again, 200 new developers every three months.

54:11.180 --> 54:12.020
That's huge.

54:12.020 --> 54:13.800
200 to 300, is that what he just said?

54:13.800 --> 54:16.240
Community, again, 200 new developers every three months.

54:16.240 --> 54:17.060
Yeah. Wow.

54:17.060 --> 54:17.900
That's huge.

54:17.900 --> 54:18.800
So we have people coming in.

54:18.800 --> 54:19.840
Yeah, and it's not, I mean,

54:19.840 --> 54:21.240
we're not just talking about young people,

54:21.240 --> 54:23.060
people who switch from other industries, right?

54:23.060 --> 54:25.640
There's a whole, there's a learning curve,

54:25.640 --> 54:26.480
no matter where you're coming from.

54:26.480 --> 54:27.300
Now, catch this little stat.

54:27.300 --> 54:28.360
Oh, yeah, I mean, if you look at Seattle,

54:28.360 --> 54:29.680
so that's where I used to live,

54:29.680 --> 54:32.500
I mean, Seattle is filled with ex-Microsoft developers

54:32.500 --> 54:34.080
working on Linux right now.

54:34.080 --> 54:36.880
Amazon, Facebook, Google, Valve,

54:36.880 --> 54:39.080
all ex-Microsoft developers contributing to Linux,

54:39.080 --> 54:39.920
which is great.

54:39.920 --> 54:41.360
We want those engineers, we want those people,

54:41.360 --> 54:43.240
and they're doing really good stuff there.

54:43.240 --> 54:44.960
I didn't know he moved out of the Seattle area.

54:44.960 --> 54:47.080
Yeah, I didn't know he was on Mercer Island.

54:47.080 --> 54:49.160
I was always gonna go have dinner with Greg.

54:49.160 --> 54:50.320
Just waitin', waitin'.

54:50.320 --> 54:52.760
Does anybody in the mobile room know where Greg lives now?

54:52.760 --> 54:53.600
Anybody?

54:53.600 --> 54:55.900
Shower him, anybody wanna go be creepy and find out?

54:55.900 --> 54:58.080
Cause I've been fantasizing about getting a burger

54:58.080 --> 54:59.960
with Greg for a while now and recording that.

54:59.960 --> 55:02.640
So that's gotta be a thing, that's still gotta happen.

55:02.640 --> 55:04.680
All right, but that's not what was interesting.

55:04.680 --> 55:06.480
I thought that was a fun to know fact.

55:06.480 --> 55:07.320
Just a tidbit.

55:07.320 --> 55:11.680
But we recently tried to cover the two

55:13.480 --> 55:16.920
very different approaches to license enforcement

55:16.920 --> 55:19.600
that are developing in the Linux kernel.

55:19.600 --> 55:22.600
There's the Greg Linus method of a long burn,

55:22.600 --> 55:24.800
work with these people over a decade.

55:25.720 --> 55:28.480
And then lazily you could say

55:28.480 --> 55:30.200
there's the software conservancy method

55:30.200 --> 55:33.200
where you try to work with them and when things fail,

55:33.200 --> 55:36.040
you quickly escalate to lawsuits.

55:36.040 --> 55:38.200
And Greg was asked about that.

55:38.200 --> 55:40.960
And I think you can tone, you can tell by the tone

55:40.960 --> 55:43.920
and you can tell by the slight awkwardness at the beginning.

55:43.920 --> 55:46.360
This is an extremely sensitive topic

55:46.360 --> 55:49.720
for Greg and the Linux Foundation and the Linux community.

55:49.720 --> 55:52.180
So pay attention to sort of the awkwardness

55:52.180 --> 55:53.400
of this question too.

55:53.400 --> 55:57.880
Healthy discussion on the kernel summit mailing list

55:59.220 --> 56:01.360
on the topic of licenses.

56:01.360 --> 56:05.000
And how can I describe it?

56:05.000 --> 56:06.200
You're gonna let me go here?

56:06.200 --> 56:08.440
I'm gonna let you go.

56:08.440 --> 56:10.000
Well, as much as you want.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.840
There's some interesting points raised.

56:11.840 --> 56:15.960
And I guess, well, let me,

56:15.960 --> 56:17.820
do you wanna describe the discussion?

56:17.820 --> 56:20.200
I think you probably remember it.

56:20.200 --> 56:21.560
Awkward.

56:21.560 --> 56:26.840
Yes, so the discussion came up about GPL enforcement.

56:26.840 --> 56:28.400
And what to do about that.

56:28.400 --> 56:30.920
And people's statements saying,

56:30.920 --> 56:33.640
making the claim that if we don't enforce the GPL,

56:33.640 --> 56:35.640
it's the same as the BSD license.

56:35.640 --> 56:37.480
And I called bullshit on that.

56:37.480 --> 56:39.120
Oh, dang.

56:39.120 --> 56:40.380
That's flat out false.

56:41.400 --> 56:45.720
And because that's not true, that's flat out false.

56:46.720 --> 56:49.140
And what we're seeing these days,

56:49.140 --> 56:52.080
I mean, yes, people violate our license.

56:52.080 --> 56:53.200
That always happens.

56:53.200 --> 56:54.140
It's gotten better.

56:54.140 --> 56:56.320
I don't know if anybody remembers the 1990s

56:56.320 --> 56:58.200
when people were shipping close source,

56:58.200 --> 57:01.540
ethernet drivers, SCSI drivers, controller drivers,

57:01.540 --> 57:03.420
everything, it was crazy.

57:03.420 --> 57:05.600
We are a lot, lot better.

57:05.600 --> 57:09.600
One of the biggest violators of the GPL used to be Intel.

57:09.600 --> 57:11.740
And now they're our biggest supporter.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.120
On more ways than one, financial, code, contributions,

57:17.120 --> 57:17.960
everything else.

57:17.960 --> 57:20.840
And that happened due to us working with them.

57:20.840 --> 57:24.480
And so my main point about GPL compliance is

57:25.440 --> 57:27.040
everybody owns their copyrights.

57:27.040 --> 57:28.800
You're free to do however you wish

57:28.800 --> 57:31.020
with those copyrights and enforcing them

57:31.020 --> 57:31.920
and getting the code.

57:31.920 --> 57:34.240
But use your judgment.

57:34.240 --> 57:36.200
The judgment should be not necessarily

57:36.200 --> 57:37.800
you have to get the code.

57:37.800 --> 57:40.440
Because if you go into a company with lawyers

57:40.440 --> 57:41.880
knocking on the front door,

57:41.880 --> 57:43.800
you're gonna get, the walls are gonna come down

57:43.800 --> 57:46.200
and you're gonna alienate everybody in that company.

57:46.200 --> 57:47.040
Let's stop right there.

57:47.040 --> 57:49.760
I think this is such a key argument.

57:49.760 --> 57:51.440
And it's one that if you come at it

57:51.440 --> 57:55.880
from a pure legal argument or a raw analysis of the license,

57:55.880 --> 57:58.320
that it doesn't resonate, it doesn't make sense to you.

57:58.320 --> 58:00.640
And this is where the software conservancy is coming from.

58:00.640 --> 58:02.120
And it's easy to be on that, right?

58:02.120 --> 58:03.400
Like we wanna protect these rights,

58:03.400 --> 58:04.960
that's what the license is about.

58:04.960 --> 58:07.960
But you also have to consider the bigger picture.

58:07.960 --> 58:11.140
And I think unless you have spent decades

58:11.140 --> 58:15.360
working with developers and changing their mind over time

58:15.360 --> 58:18.320
and working with them to be more interoperable with Linux

58:18.320 --> 58:20.840
and then reaping the benefits of that,

58:20.840 --> 58:23.160
you fail to understand how important

58:23.160 --> 58:24.380
that particular process is.

58:24.380 --> 58:26.280
And what he's talking about here is

58:26.280 --> 58:28.700
when we get into these legal enforcement battles,

58:28.700 --> 58:30.320
these companies shut down.

58:30.320 --> 58:32.600
And any contributions we were gonna get go away.

58:32.600 --> 58:34.360
And all of the naysayers in the company

58:34.360 --> 58:35.640
are all of a sudden proven right.

58:35.640 --> 58:37.040
Use your judgment.

58:37.040 --> 58:39.020
The judgment should be not necessarily

58:39.020 --> 58:40.600
you have to get the code.

58:40.600 --> 58:43.240
Because if you go into a company with lawyers

58:43.240 --> 58:45.360
knocking on the front door, you're gonna get,

58:45.360 --> 58:46.600
the walls are gonna come down

58:46.600 --> 58:49.140
and you're gonna alienate everybody in that company

58:49.140 --> 58:50.320
that was using Linux.

58:50.320 --> 58:52.520
Because inside every company when you start using Linux,

58:52.520 --> 58:53.700
you have two camps.

58:53.700 --> 58:55.800
One is like, oh, those hippies and punks,

58:55.800 --> 58:57.540
we can't use this crazy stuff.

58:57.540 --> 58:59.380
And then you convince them and you finally get that.

58:59.380 --> 59:01.600
And if one of those people, those crazy hippies and punks

59:01.600 --> 59:03.440
shows up at the front door with a lawyer,

59:03.440 --> 59:05.020
boom, you proved them right.

59:05.020 --> 59:09.080
You were wrong, doors come down, everything works bad.

59:09.080 --> 59:12.360
But if as a developer you go to that same company

59:12.360 --> 59:13.860
and contact the developers in there and say,

59:13.860 --> 59:17.520
hey, what can I do to help you get your code merged

59:17.520 --> 59:18.840
into the kernel?

59:18.840 --> 59:21.340
And that's a totally different way of working with them.

59:21.340 --> 59:23.940
That says, hey, the community's willing to work with you,

59:23.940 --> 59:25.380
willing to invest their time with you,

59:25.380 --> 59:27.080
willing to make your product better.

59:27.080 --> 59:29.160
And that's the best way to work forward.

59:29.160 --> 59:31.080
We have seen it time and time again

59:31.080 --> 59:34.060
that when you go in with lawyers or representatives

59:34.060 --> 59:36.720
of the developers and not the developers themselves,

59:36.720 --> 59:39.760
the walls come down, all contact gets shut off.

59:39.760 --> 59:42.000
I'm working with a silicon company today

59:42.000 --> 59:44.360
that has been shipping Linux on their product

59:44.360 --> 59:46.120
for eight, nine years.

59:46.120 --> 59:48.000
No code has ever come out of them.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.320
The developers inside the company reached out,

59:50.320 --> 59:52.580
I met some of them and they're saying, help us.

59:52.580 --> 59:54.400
I'm like, okay, great, we'll work with you.

59:54.400 --> 59:56.680
And the thing is, the code from this company

59:56.680 --> 59:59.400
is usually almost always is crap.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.080
We don't want that code.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:04.800
We really don't.

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.440
I mean, you might want to get that one device working,

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.280
but you really want is that company and those developers

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.400
in that company to become part of our community

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.560
and then label us to grow.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.280
Because the only way we're gonna survive

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:15.680
is if we continue to grow

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.380
and continue to bring more people in.

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:20.300
We're gonna age out, we pass away,

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:21.320
we move on to other things.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:24.560
We need more people in our community in order to survive.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.800
So you work with that company,

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:27.640
you make them reliant on Linux,

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.520
you make them realize that working with the community

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.360
actually saves them time and money,

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.760
which has been proven over and over and over.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.640
And then they're now reliant so much on Linux

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.160
that they have to invest.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.200
They are part of the community, they rely on it.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.020
And it works.

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:42.920
Look at all the sponsors and look at all the people

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.600
who've been contributing to Linux over time.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.280
Again, I'll point out as Intel

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.320
is the perfect poster child for this.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.320
They now do everything on Linux

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.060
and they used to be our worst violator.

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:54.880
It can happen, things can change.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:55.980
And we're in it for the long haul.

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:57.960
We don't want just the instant code dump.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:59.760
We want you to work together

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.160
and become part of our community.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.680
We're in it for the long haul.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.440
We don't just want the instant code dump.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.560
I like this.

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.160
I like everything about this.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:09.560
Mohsen Rath, you had a comment on it.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.400
Go ahead.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.380
Mohsen, oh sorry Mohsen Rath, you're muted.

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.720
Start over again, that was my bad.

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:17.920
Sorry about that, okay.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.220
So I believe that you guys had this argument

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:23.440
a few times over on both Linux Unplugged

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.640
as well as Linux Action Store.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.540
Are you accusing me of repeating

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:29.240
because these clips are brand new, sir.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.680
These are brand new clips, certified.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.760
The clips are new.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:33.800
The clips are brand new,

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.960
but the argument is an old one.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.120
Which argument would you say that it's enforcement?

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:38.960
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.360
As Talness put it right there,

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.040
coders versus lawyers in terms of

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.680
do you want to take the open hand

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.840
or do you want to take the closed fist?

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.720
But as I remember watching,

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.720
actually I wasn't watching,

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.280
I was reading it in a comic book,

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.480
the closed fist can still be used to protect

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.300
whereas the open hand can be used to harm.

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.680
So the end result is you have to sit there

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:01.760
and take each company as a fresh approach.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:06.080
You take the most genial, the most open approach.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.640
You start with that one first

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.500
and you work your way down the line.

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.720
Because as they said, they used to have beef with Intel.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.560
Intel could have said,

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.560
hey, you know this open source thing?

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.860
You guys don't have real lawyers and stuff like that.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.400
We do, we now own you, your family,

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.480
your entire genetic line, your computers,

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.960
your cars, everything.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.640
Thank you for being our work slaves, enjoy.

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.580
They could have done that because it's Intel.

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.200
Much like Apple, much like Google now,

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.720
they had the money to do that.

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:36.260
But they instead, they were just like, you know what?

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.680
We want them to use our product in a fashion

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.680
that everyone can benefit.

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.980
So we're gonna just walk to them real nice

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:45.880
and talk to them real nice first,

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:48.640
see if they see things from our perspective first

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.360
before showing up with lawyers, quote-unquote,

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:56.000
showing up with the FDA or whichever law enforcement it is

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.960
kicking down the door and saying, you stole our stuff.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:03.100
Yeah, I would say, what I think,

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.000
what I like to look at this situation

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.840
as regular everyday Linux users,

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:13.840
it's happening at a level that is really kind of obscure to us.

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:17.040
We're not really cognizant of these kinds of things going on

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:20.160
but there is, between the core contributors to the kernel

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:24.280
and the software conservancy, which is a new group set up,

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:27.600
I mean, there is a new level of argument brewing

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.360
that we don't really have any involvement with.

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.000
We can only just sit back and watch

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.600
and it doesn't directly affect us,

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.600
yet it could have long-term ramifications.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.360
And it's fascinating that there's this disconnect there.

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.640
There's this whole thing brewing under the surface

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:44.240
and we just get little glimpses of it from time to time.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:47.480
I think it's been an argument,

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.480
as Moser Rath has pointed out,

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.360
it's been a conversation for as long

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:51.760
as this has been a particular issue,

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.200
especially as GPL software

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.240
has begun to get widespread adoption.

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:58.280
I think it really marks the distinction

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.760
between the Linux community and the wider GPL community,

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:04.160
free software community, et cetera.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.320
And I wonder if it's not turning

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:09.780
to a more significant volume now,

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.460
now that you have the conservancy

01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:14.840
and you have new offenders that are in the mobile space

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.840
that are particularly egregious.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:19.440
ARM platform has a lot of issues around it.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.460
I wonder if it's not being ratcheted up to a new level now.

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:25.520
And I don't wanna go as far as to call it a cold war

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.600
because that feels like it's adding a hype spin

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.440
that's undeserved,

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.440
sort of like that airplane bomber in the background.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.760
But I do feel like it is definitely something

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:37.800
that desperately is getting close to needing a resolution.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.960
And I don't know if there's one on the horizon

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:44.160
because there's some big fiefdoms being set up.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:48.360
And you have people that are in positions that are,

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:51.960
I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm worried

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.560
that people like Greg and Linus

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:56.500
could eventually get burned out by this kind of stuff.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:00.520
Or there could be some sort of developer loss

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.720
as this battle goes on.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.680
And that's the part I look at and wonder

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.360
if we'll have longer ramifications

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.040
on the quality of Linux code.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.000
That's the only kind of point.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.800
I know that's an extrapolation,

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.880
but if you think about it,

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:15.560
if I'm Greg and I'm 20-plus years, whatever, into this,

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.240
you know what, I've made my bones,

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:20.280
I've made my reputation, I don't need this bullshit.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.380
I don't need to go to events carrying two lawyers

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:25.760
because of what this has led to.

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.300
I don't need that hassle.

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:30.480
You know what, guys, I've made my peace,

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:33.120
good luck with everything, I'm moving on.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:34.360
I don't think that's a reasonable thing

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.240
when you're getting down,

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.360
because as somebody in Greg's position,

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:41.960
you have to look at this and go, this is obvious.

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.960
You are getting in the way of my ability

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.680
to make this thing better.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:49.080
And all I wanna do is make this a better thing,

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.000
and you're making it harder for me to do that,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.240
and I've dedicated my life to this, and I'm done with this.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.620
And that doesn't seem like an unreasonable position

01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.560
for someone that's worked as long as he has to do this.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.280
And I'm sure it can feel like other people

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.360
who may feel that they have a legitimate claim

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:08.240
or are representing those who do have a legitimate claim,

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.360
I can see how that might feel like an outside influence

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:13.320
that's trying to hurt or do something

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.480
that you don't feel is best for you.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.840
Imagine, say, Greg or somebody like Greg

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.840
felt they were on the precipice

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.720
of finally getting a company to come along

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.760
and really get involved at Linux,

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:24.560
and another group starts up a legal battle,

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.920
and it totally shuts down all of the progress

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.400
you've been making for the last three years.

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:32.400
How excruciatingly frustrating would that be?

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.480
And that's where I worry it's going.

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.560
W.W., you wanna jump in?

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:36.520
Go ahead, sir.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.760
Well, I do understand your...

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:41.200
I fully acknowledge that your point

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.840
of him possibly getting burned out

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.960
and getting sick of being open

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.160
and just trying to be nice to people and get them in.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:53.240
I don't think when he does get people in,

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.840
that's all he's doing.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:00.120
When you really want to impart something

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.800
to a lot of people,

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.640
and you want to make it great and open source,

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:08.720
you don't just want to impart just the code.

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:12.600
You want to impart your passion

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.920
and what drives you to do this

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:19.040
and put in the effort that you do

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.560
to make it great and open source.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.200
And I would like to think that maybe Greg

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.920
and others of similar mindset

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.280
would be putting in that effort

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:33.440
to have people not just contribute back

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.680
and contribute open source code,

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:39.120
that they try to contribute that sentiment

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.960
that they feel of why they're doing this

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:46.000
to other people so that they continue

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.920
to have that feeling

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:51.600
and they continue to want to make open source great.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.360
Yeah, I think you're probably right.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:54.200
I hope so.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:56.440
And why don't we wrap this all up

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.680
on a more positive, just sort of funny,

01:07:58.680 --> 01:07:59.840
tongue-in-cheek note.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.280
Why the hell does the Linux kernel team

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.640
still use email for so many damn things?

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:06.760
So, doesn't the reliance on dusty old email,

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:07.760
doesn't that just make us look

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.280
like a bunch of old gray beards?

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.280
You know, like get off my lawn type.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:14.240
So, you know, it's 2016.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.080
I mean, come on, Greg.

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:18.200
Email, that's our patch review system.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.840
Can we do better?

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.320
Give me the 30 second pitch.

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:23.720
30 second pitch is there's nothing else better.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.160
There's nothing else faster.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:28.080
There's nothing else more in use by the whole world.

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.040
Email, plain text works great

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:33.120
for people who can't use GUIs,

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.760
have intermittent email access to the internet.

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:38.520
English is not their first language

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.720
and connectivity issues again.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:44.480
And for review, I mean, as proof in the talk before mine,

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:50.040
I reviewed 53 patches and accepted 13 of them in 15 minutes.

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:52.600
And, Garrett, there's no way.

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.760
There you go.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.000
Greg, you don't need no Slack.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.520
Although, seriously, you should check out Mattermost

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.360
and Matrix.

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:01.200
Or Rocketrat.

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.040
Yeah, Matrix.

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:02.880
Yeah.

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.800
And then, eventually, maybe one of them.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.920
Well, I think with Matrix, they'll all work together.

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:07.840
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:08.880
You know what else works together?

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.720
Our Mumble Room.

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.760
Go over to jblive.tv on a Tuesday.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:12.600
Do Bang Mumble.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.480
You'll get the info and join us.

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:15.080

Goodbye, everybody.

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.000
Bye!

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:12.920
I secretly use Arch Linux damn Popey made it for the whole show I mad respect sir mad

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:17.960
respect I I hope you had at least yourself something delicious to sip on

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:24.040
while you sat there hold on sorry muted hello sorry say again say again sorry

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:28.320
they like they like savings here means it's an hour earlier right that happens

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.280
this Sunday here in the States that you know we have a double last coming up

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:37.280
this Sunday by the way everybody and it's getting screwed by daylight savings

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:41.320
although I'll have an extra hour of sleep so it's interesting see yeah you

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:44.560
guys already did that that was Bush thing huh well you guys oh man it's

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.600
still confusing the whole thing how many years later has it been since this got

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:52.440
out of sync and it's still confusing yep well I'm glad you made a Popey I really

01:10:52.440 --> 01:11:02.560
appreciate it connection issues earlier I don't know why yeah I saw that he sent

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:05.680
me a note that sucks that sucks hey you know what I forgot to mention during the

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:10.120
cadian live discussion is today I've been shooting a video behind the scenes

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:13.640
here JB just a little bit bits and pieces specifically to do an editing

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:17.040
comparison in cadian live and an editing comparison and final cut it's like

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.880
science if I remember I will do follow-up next week on the episode and

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:26.000
tell you let's all remind him yeah I am supposed to ask you something before I

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.360
start poppy before are you if you have you bailed already yeah no he's still

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:33.480
there he's still there I guess I'm supposed to ask you was it it's um I

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:39.920
forgot I forgot what I'm supposed to ask you about a quote the cloud being other

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:55.000
people's computers what is this what am I what is it did know I put you up to

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
this I think I think maybe if you go three steps remove that may be the case

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.520
I'm not sure it's been passed to me through a series of messengers who I'm

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:09.640
sure this conversation have you what is it well I don't remember much these days

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:14.440
but I do seem to recall I get irritated when people say it because it doesn't

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:17.280
have to be the case the cloud or the cloud is other people's computers which

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.880
one the cloud is other it's the cloud is other people computers because the fact

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:25.120
is that doesn't have to be the case you can have your own orchestration of

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:29.200
computers that you could call a cloud and it's your own private computers but

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.400
yes not to be someone else's would you agree though when people say the cloud

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:35.480
they're generally referring to hosted services generally referring to a public

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:38.160
cloud but you could still have a private cloud is yeah well of course which is

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:42.600
your own yeah of course but you could but I mean I think in general when

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:47.600
people refer to the cloud they're referring to Azure Amazon digital ocean

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.040
rackspace certainly micro services things like that that's what they're

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.640
referring to I I think don't you depends who you ask because some people for some

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:58.640
people cloud is Dropbox and for other people cloud is just you know a picture

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:04.160
on a diagram it depends who you ask and I think you and people of your level of

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:09.200
intelligence saying that know exactly what it means and I think you know what

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:12.520
public and private clouds are I feel like if you're like private clouds are

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:17.600
like local clouds could be the fog I'm looking across the room well at my next

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:22.440
cloud box right yeah I guess I see your point but I also feel like it's good to

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:27.040
remind people that the cloud can also be a sort of a marketing obfuscation tool

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:33.600
sure can be but it doesn't it's not it's not a blanket whenever I hear it it's

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:39.160
it's it's always seen as like this is the only state that like the cloud is

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:42.960
somebody else's computer fact end of story and that just doesn't tell the

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.360
whole story that's because when most people set up a server they don't call

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:49.800
it the cloud they call it my server that's because they only have one if

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:53.640
they had multiple than they would call it like I call my own I don't call I

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:57.040
have I have a bunch of servers I don't call it my cloud no but mine orchestrate

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.000
with each other in a way that it's not important which one I'm actually hitting

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.960
okay well so then that okay do you okay all right so it's more sort of obscure

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:08.440
and you can't really tell where you're actually going necessarily I'll tell you

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:13.360
honestly I generally prefer this version because it makes the cloud less

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.960
bullshitty hype but they were it but I still think the main issue is when you

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:22.480
if you were to take a room of a thousand geeks a like you're at a conference and

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.840
ask them what's the cloud I think they would all think it's it's a it's

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.400
services hosted by it by a third party I think to an end-user where the cloud

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.600
terminology is important it's just to emphasize that they don't have to worry

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.440
about storing their own data that someone else is going to handle that

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:43.520
when I think of cloud I think of managed infrastructure yeah exactly it's

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:49.240
yeah yeah yeah contract service level agreement with that company and you know

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:51.840
they're providing a service in the same way that you're paying for your

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:55.680
utilities at home hey it's not the water utilities it's somebody else's water

01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:03.120
it's not okay I like that argument too I still feel like though that this is

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:06.640
pretty down in the weeds and that's your main core issue with this is it so far

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:11.360
down the weeds is like it's like arguing that you shouldn't call a tissue paper

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:18.000
Kleenex no no no no I it's it's just that I don't like that that's the only

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.360
side of the argument that's ever expressed and it's and it's used as a

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:26.000
stick to beat cloud as if cloud is a bad thing and you should never use it

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.880
because it's somebody else's computer it's bullshit all your services were

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:31.920
already running on someone else's computer they were just maybe doing it

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:35.960
less scalably yeah yeah mm-hmm I guess I see your point I see your point I just

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:39.440
don't see like it's I think that's a losing battle it's a language battle

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:46.240
that's been lost so it is thanks for bringing out yeah I guess you know how

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:53.120
about this is a line build your own cloud yeah I've done that thanks
