00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 28 for February 18th, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:41.040
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's still raggin' high from

00:41.040 --> 00:43.380
episode 300 of the Linux Action Show.

00:43.380 --> 00:44.620
My name is Chris.

00:44.620 --> 00:45.620
My name is Matt.

00:45.620 --> 00:46.620
Hello there, sir.

00:46.620 --> 00:47.620
Hello, Matt.

00:47.620 --> 00:48.620
Hello.

00:48.620 --> 00:52.320
We've been enjoying quite a good amount of feedback, a lot of positive feedback about

00:52.320 --> 00:55.400
the announcement of our new show, How To Linux, which you're gonna be hearing more about

00:55.400 --> 00:59.600
soon on all fine Jupyter broadcasting programming, I'm sure.

00:59.600 --> 01:03.320
It's just so cool to see so many people so excited about something new like that, so

01:03.320 --> 01:04.320
that's really gratifying.

01:04.320 --> 01:05.320
Thank you, everybody.

01:05.320 --> 01:07.520
Now look, we got a good show coming up today right here on Unplugged.

01:07.520 --> 01:10.200
Later on, towards the end of the show, we're gonna do a giveaway.

01:10.200 --> 01:15.300
We're gonna give away some games for the trivia that we announced in episode 300 of Linux

01:15.300 --> 01:17.400
Action Show, so we'll get that taken care of.

01:17.400 --> 01:22.820
We got some really good feedback about getting the younger generation into Linux, and also

01:22.820 --> 01:24.720
we're gonna bring on Michael Hall.

01:24.720 --> 01:28.040
He works at Canonical as, get this, Matt, the upstream liaison.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.840
Ooh, oh, right on.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.120
Yeah, that's, so, you know, could you imagine, like, you're at a bar and somebody says, you

01:33.120 --> 01:34.120
say, what do you do for a living?

01:34.120 --> 01:35.120
Oh, I'm an upstream liaison.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.120
That just sounds cool.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.520
Yeah, I mean, that's a great title.

01:38.520 --> 01:42.160
So we're gonna bring him on because he just had a recent post today.

01:42.160 --> 01:47.720
I guess he's been doing essentially a blog a day, and he's calling it a new 80-20 rule

01:47.720 --> 01:48.720
for open source.

01:48.720 --> 01:52.540
He says, put simply, the rule says that people will tend to appreciate it more when you give

01:52.540 --> 01:56.280
them 20% of something and resent you if you give them 80%.

01:56.280 --> 02:02.080
He says, I know, it sounds completely counterintuitive, but that's what I was seeing in all the conversations

02:02.080 --> 02:05.600
around Mozilla and say things around Canonical and Ubuntu.

02:05.600 --> 02:09.080
People by and large were saying that the reason Canonical and Mozilla were being judged so

02:09.080 --> 02:14.360
harshly was because they already did most of what people wanted, which made them resent

02:14.360 --> 02:17.440
when they didn't do everything.

02:17.440 --> 02:20.520
What a great point, and I gotta tell you, I think that's something you and I have some

02:20.520 --> 02:21.520
thoughts on.

02:21.520 --> 02:22.520
Definitely.

02:22.520 --> 02:26.880
I think there's multiple tiers to it, but I think the meat and potatoes of it is definitely

02:26.880 --> 02:33.000
that people do develop an expectation surrounded with what they're presented with initially.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.840
So back when I was doing a lot of free Linux questions, I had people that were really upset

02:37.840 --> 02:41.480
if I didn't respond within a certain period of time or if I didn't have time to respond

02:41.480 --> 02:42.480
at all.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.640
I mean, they would really feel offended, and I think that certainly translates as true

02:45.640 --> 02:46.960
as in this space as well.

02:46.960 --> 02:50.840
Yeah, and I could totally see how software developers find themselves in this position,

02:50.840 --> 02:55.320
especially in an open community, so we'll talk about that coming up in the show.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.760
And then if we have a little time, we've got a couple other topics we're going to jump

02:57.760 --> 03:04.120
to as well as I want to help a fellow Linux-unplugged audience member who had a hard drive kind

03:04.120 --> 03:05.120
of give out on him recently.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.120
Oh!

03:06.120 --> 03:07.120
Oh, I always feel bad for that.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.120
I know.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.560
So maybe we'll pick the mumble room and see what they think we could do for him.

03:11.560 --> 03:14.360
But first, let's start with our feedback from last week's episode.

03:14.360 --> 03:18.880
We like to try to keep a thread going between all of the episodes so that way if you listen

03:18.880 --> 03:23.200
continuously, you kind of get a payoff there because we're not episodic.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.120
We're not getting, we're not going to get some big deal from the networks like Star

03:26.120 --> 03:28.880
Trek The Next Generation to where they couldn't have a nice storyline.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.240
No, no sir, here we have storyline.

03:31.240 --> 03:35.520
And our first email comes in from ExtraordinaryBenny says, hey Chris, Matt, and Chase.

03:35.520 --> 03:36.520
Oh, look at this.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.520
Chase is getting emails now.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.520
Nice.

03:38.520 --> 03:39.520
Good deal.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.520
He's in.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.520
Like the community is giving him a big hug.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.520
That is awesome.

03:42.520 --> 03:47.000
He's doing an AMA right now in the Linux Action Show subreddit too if you guys have any questions

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
for him.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.560
My name is Ben and I'm a fellow Washingtonian.

03:49.560 --> 03:50.560
Oh, nice, Ben.

03:50.560 --> 03:53.360
He says, by the way, since there's other Bens in the ISC, you should probably just call me

03:53.360 --> 03:54.360
ExtraordinaryBenny.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.440
First off, I want to thank you guys for all of the effort you put into making such an

03:57.440 --> 03:59.160
awesome content on Jupiter Broadcasting.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.160
Thanks, Ben.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.600
I was very excited when you announced the new How-To Linux show you're planning.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.920
This is just the kind of thing the Linux community needs for newcomers or those who want to improve

04:05.920 --> 04:07.280
their skills in Linux.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.400
I was really surprised with the timing of your announcement because I was just thinking

04:10.400 --> 04:14.440
about starting a website for Linux users that would be a repository of guides, how-tos and

04:14.440 --> 04:18.880
what not for people to search, update and contribute articles to, similar to how DigitalOcean

04:18.880 --> 04:21.880
has one for their community, but it would contain everything from customizing gnome

04:21.880 --> 04:24.440
themes to setting up your own firewall.

04:24.440 --> 04:27.880
Of course, this would probably be a far too great of a task to take on my own, but with

04:27.880 --> 04:32.760
the new show coming into play, I think a community organized effort would make it possible.

04:32.760 --> 04:35.840
He goes on to say, if we had a site like this to complement the show, I think it would be

04:35.840 --> 04:38.040
a huge benefit for everyone.

04:38.040 --> 04:41.200
I'd love to hear what you guys think from the JBU community of this idea.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.200
ExtraordinaryBenny.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.840
We hadn't really talked about this, but I do see value in something like this.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.520
I think this is a great idea.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.440
So ExtraordinaryBenny, we should chat more.

04:49.440 --> 04:53.420
And I'd love to hear all ideas you guys have for the how-to show.

04:53.420 --> 04:57.840
We're going to have in the future, as the show gets probably really just the next week

04:57.840 --> 05:01.720
or two, you'll see these prop up in the Linux Action Show subreddit.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.280
We'll start up some threads looking for your ideas and your feedback.

05:04.280 --> 05:08.200
So keep thinking of this kind of stuff and we'll have some outlets for you to bring those

05:08.200 --> 05:09.200
in.

05:09.200 --> 05:14.320
And then also, as the show starts, we'll incorporate your feedback and any ideas you have like

05:14.320 --> 05:15.320
that.

05:15.320 --> 05:16.720
I think having a web resource, though, is a really great idea.

05:16.720 --> 05:17.720
So thanks, ExtraordinaryBenny.

05:17.720 --> 05:22.200
I'm not quite sure how we'd pull that off because the podcast production itself is such

05:22.200 --> 05:27.880
a task that I don't know about also updating a website, but it seems really valuable.

05:27.880 --> 05:32.920
I think that if it was done first of all Wiki style, I think that would be the first thing,

05:32.920 --> 05:35.560
which means that it's done by the community.

05:35.560 --> 05:36.560
We're hands off.

05:36.560 --> 05:37.560
It's up to you guys.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.920
I don't know if something like that was to take place to where it was based off show

05:39.920 --> 05:42.280
notes and basically what was observed, perhaps.

05:42.280 --> 05:43.280
I don't know.

05:43.280 --> 05:44.280
That's going to be tough, though.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.280
Yeah.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.280
We'll chat more.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.280
I think that's worth...

05:47.280 --> 05:48.280
I think it's a great idea.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.280
And I'd like to hear what the community thinks about it.

05:49.280 --> 05:52.640
So Tom writes in, and this was really the topic last week that I thought really got

05:52.640 --> 05:55.680
the most traction as far as our feedback goes, and we got a lot of emails in about this,

05:55.680 --> 06:01.160
so I picked a couple that I came across and some other ones, I didn't get to all of them.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.840
So Tom wrote, he said, this week, you had a younger listener write in about their experiences

06:04.840 --> 06:06.360
and I thought I might add my perspective.

06:06.360 --> 06:09.960
I'm slightly older than your writer, I'm 17, but I've been doing the same sort of things

06:09.960 --> 06:10.960
since I was younger.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.040
I had experienced similar problems in education.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.800
My teacher is so poor, and I don't think he means in the money sense, I think he means

06:16.800 --> 06:20.080
in the talent sense, that it's turned into a running joke.

06:20.080 --> 06:24.360
There are at least three people in my class of 16 who could teach better, two of which

06:24.360 --> 06:25.360
are J.B. listeners.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.360
That's awesome.

06:26.360 --> 06:31.240
Even worse, the curriculum for my computing A level is unimaginably out of touch.

06:31.240 --> 06:35.880
For example, the operating system chapter is more about obscure batch processing systems

06:35.880 --> 06:41.160
and considers operating systems which can multitask as notable than about topics relevant

06:41.160 --> 06:42.160
to this decade.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.160
Wow.

06:43.160 --> 06:47.320
I think that there is no chance of people being taught useful groundings in schools

06:47.320 --> 06:49.960
here in England without substantial change.

06:49.960 --> 06:56.000
However, I have found that a very large number of my peers religiously follow gaming subreddits

06:56.000 --> 06:57.240
and Valve.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.780
With the Snowden revelations and Steam coming to Linux, I have noticed many more people

07:00.780 --> 07:04.760
asking me to recommend a distro to try.

07:04.760 --> 07:05.760
Very interesting.

07:05.760 --> 07:09.760
For all the hard work you do and amazing shows, one Jupiter Broadcasting show is more educational

07:09.760 --> 07:12.400
than a month of my A level classes.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.400
That's funny.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.960
Double win for you.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.120
Yeah, that's pretty good.

07:17.120 --> 07:25.240
Yeah, I felt like, so this is one of the reasons that I have been a proponent of gaming coming

07:25.240 --> 07:31.220
to Linux, not because I like promoting a platform that sells commercial games that are restricted

07:31.220 --> 07:32.220
by DRM.

07:32.220 --> 07:43.920
That's not how I would prefer it, but I believe that humans, they like shiny things.

07:43.920 --> 07:48.080
They will go to a lot of efforts to have a great gaming experience and it's fun for them.

07:48.080 --> 07:49.080
It becomes a mission.

07:49.080 --> 07:53.000
It becomes a quest to have the ultimate gaming experience, to have the most framerates, to

07:53.000 --> 07:58.120
have the best sound, all of this, and to have your system be the most performant possible.

07:58.120 --> 08:02.680
I think this is why gaming is important for desktop Linux, even though the vast majority

08:02.680 --> 08:07.600
of Linux users today do not find themselves that interested by the gaming topic.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.560
Boy, boy.

08:09.560 --> 08:11.160
You know, I think you pretty much nailed it.

08:11.160 --> 08:15.920
I definitely think that, because I know for myself, I try to limp along with my older

08:15.920 --> 08:20.200
experiences, my older computers and whatnot, but I'm always yearning for that next greatest

08:20.200 --> 08:21.200
latest thing.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.200
I want the fastest phone.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.240
I want the best computer.

08:23.240 --> 08:24.560
So I think you really nailed it.

08:24.560 --> 08:34.920
Yeah, and you know, if SteamOS and Linux become even a good option and Microsoft keeps cocking

08:34.920 --> 08:39.320
it up with Windows, I mean, the two will come to meet and people will be driven and then

08:39.320 --> 08:43.920
you have all these other ancillary issues like privacy and the cost and reinvestment

08:43.920 --> 08:47.440
in hardware and all these kinds of things that also push people towards Linux.

08:47.440 --> 08:53.120
So I'm positive in the freedom dimension about Linux's potentials, even when it's being used

08:53.120 --> 08:57.240
to play proprietary games, because I believe the benefit of bringing more people to use

08:57.240 --> 09:03.540
Linux just to get people on the desktop will improve the Linux desktop situation on a whole.

09:03.540 --> 09:06.400
So even though what might have brought them, I guess what I'm trying to, the way to summarize

09:06.400 --> 09:11.320
this is what might have brought them might have been that proprietary game that has DRM

09:11.320 --> 09:16.780
that they paid money for, but then they end up staying in an open source ecosystem.

09:16.780 --> 09:20.400
And I think that's the important part for the long run.

09:20.400 --> 09:24.640
Well, I think so that really could translate into they came for the really fancy micro

09:24.640 --> 09:29.240
brew beer and they, you know, and they stayed with the cheap stuff and the camaraderie of

09:29.240 --> 09:30.240
the folks around them.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.240
Yeah.

09:31.240 --> 09:35.840
Well, cheap or cheap or low cost, you know, however you want to put it.

09:35.840 --> 09:39.240
I'm not saying low rent, but low cost.

09:39.240 --> 09:43.560
I like anytime we can try to get this close to a beer analogy because Washington's got

09:43.560 --> 09:44.800
some great micro brews.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.440
So I would love to do an episode of Linux Unplugged at a micro brewery, even though

09:48.440 --> 09:50.040
it's completely unrelated to Linux.

09:50.040 --> 09:51.600
I just, I want to do it.

09:51.600 --> 09:55.720
So if you are in the area in Washington and you have a micro brewery and you listen to

09:55.720 --> 10:00.040
this show, you should probably get ahold of us, email us, go over to jupiterbroadcasting.com

10:00.040 --> 10:01.560
and click that contact link.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.280
I want to do a show from your brewery.

10:03.280 --> 10:06.760
I don't care if the sound's going to be bad, but I would like to drink a little bit of

10:06.760 --> 10:07.760
your beer.

10:07.760 --> 10:08.760
Just a little bit.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.200
I can't drink a lot cause I, the gluten, but are we air quoting a little bit or are

10:11.200 --> 10:12.200
we?

10:12.200 --> 10:13.200
I'm serious.

10:13.200 --> 10:18.600
Well, little is a, you know, that's, there's some flexibility in its definition you might

10:18.600 --> 10:19.600
say.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.600
All right, Matt.

10:20.600 --> 10:24.540
Well, before we go into our next email, which is really a great stretch of a couple of emails

10:24.540 --> 10:27.360
we'll get to, I want to thank DigitalOcean.

10:27.360 --> 10:31.720
DigitalOcean is one of our sponsors for Linux Unplugged and DigitalOcean is simple cloud

10:31.720 --> 10:36.340
hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up your own cloud server

10:36.340 --> 10:38.440
that you have root login to.

10:38.440 --> 10:42.480
Users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds, although I believe the record right now is

10:42.480 --> 10:43.640
44 seconds.

10:43.640 --> 10:47.280
If anybody beats that, you got to let us know, but the record right now is 44 seconds, but

10:47.280 --> 10:48.700
here's the best part.

10:48.700 --> 10:54.360
Planning plans start at $5 per month for 512 megs of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and

10:54.360 --> 10:57.920
a terabyte, yeah, a terabyte of transfer.

10:57.920 --> 11:02.080
Now what you can do with these is endless because they have Ubuntu droplets you can

11:02.080 --> 11:03.080
deploy.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.580
They have Arch, CentOS, everything you might want like that.

11:04.580 --> 11:07.600
They have ones preloaded with the LAMP stack, preloaded with Docker, et cetera.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.720
You can create your own snapshots, back them up, redeploy them as you need them.

11:10.720 --> 11:15.280
I just heard from somebody in our chat room today who used it to set up their own private

11:15.280 --> 11:16.280
XMPP server.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.280
So they have their own private chat server, right?

11:18.280 --> 11:23.560
I'm using it for BitTorrent Sync, and I just set up a Pastebin alternative, an open source

11:23.560 --> 11:27.440
PHP based Pastebin alternative that I might talk about in a future Linux action show.

11:27.440 --> 11:31.000
I just tossed it up on my DigitalOcean Arch server, and it's been awesome.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.440
They have a great connection, tier one bandwidth, paired with those SSDs, it really syncs.

11:36.440 --> 11:40.960
DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam, and now

11:40.960 --> 11:42.160
Singapore.

11:42.160 --> 11:46.080
With that simple and intuitive control panel, you'll be whipping right through there, and

11:46.080 --> 11:50.600
good news, if you're a power user, you can actually replicate the functionality with

11:50.600 --> 11:54.160
their straightforward API, build your own commands, build your own interface if you

11:54.160 --> 11:55.160
need to.

11:55.160 --> 11:58.440
I'll tell you what, you know, you bundle this with, we were talking earlier about Jitsi

11:58.440 --> 12:02.840
and Jitsi's video bridge, and JITmeet and whatnot, you can run this on one of these

12:02.840 --> 12:03.840
bad boys.

12:03.840 --> 12:04.840
Yeah, perfect.

12:04.840 --> 12:05.840
And you could essentially have your own Skype.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.880
It'd be perfect, too, for a web RTC control server.

12:07.880 --> 12:11.080
Look, go play with it, because we have a special offer for you.

12:11.080 --> 12:14.720
Use the promo code LinuxUnpluggedFebruary, yeah, LinuxUnpluggedFebruary, that's all

12:14.720 --> 12:15.720
one word.

12:15.720 --> 12:20.080
You'll get a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean by using LinuxUnpluggedFebruary.

12:20.080 --> 12:24.440
Now if you use the $5 machine, which I've been using for months now, months, if you

12:24.440 --> 12:26.600
use the $5 machine, you're gonna get two months for free.

12:26.600 --> 12:32.080
They got tons of great technology, powered by KVM, sitting on top of SSD hard drives,

12:32.080 --> 12:36.520
tier one bandwidth, global image transfer, private networking in certain data centers,

12:36.520 --> 12:41.080
an easy to use control panel, DNS management, resizing a server in a single click, backup

12:41.080 --> 12:45.080
and snapshots, a web console, one click application installed, two factor authentication, and

12:45.080 --> 12:47.960
a fantastic developer community, DigitalOcean.com.

12:47.960 --> 12:53.000
Use the promo code LinuxUnpluggedFebruary, and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
LinuxUnplugged.

12:54.000 --> 13:03.120
All right, let's continue on this thread that we were talking about with the younger audience

13:03.120 --> 13:06.520
getting into Linux and how they're kind of up against a lot of odds right now.

13:06.520 --> 13:10.760
Daniel Ronin says, I don't think that Linux literacy is specific to today's generation,

13:10.760 --> 13:12.120
illiteracy I should say.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.320
It has always been like this.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.520
It was the same back in the days when I was in school.

13:16.520 --> 13:21.200
People in general are not interested in how stuff works, just that it does work.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.680
This is changing though.

13:22.680 --> 13:27.040
Before it was practically impossible to find any 14 year old doing Linux anywhere.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.640
Now there are a couple of them in every city.

13:29.640 --> 13:33.520
They might be alone in their school, but overall there are more youngsters doing it than before.

13:33.520 --> 13:37.640
Steam will change this too, and it'll become even more common in the generations to come.

13:37.640 --> 13:42.580
Schools are not doing Linux because it's not perceived as common enough, which is true.

13:42.580 --> 13:47.920
Most workplaces do, Microsoft and its office suite, and as long as this is true, schools

13:47.920 --> 13:48.920
will not change.

13:48.920 --> 13:53.520
They are supposed to give kids enough basic knowledge to be able to handle a word processor.

13:53.520 --> 13:54.520
That's what they do.

13:54.520 --> 13:56.760
I don't agree with this, but it's the logic behind it.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.200
Chromebooks and Google Docs are changing this now.

13:59.200 --> 14:02.600
The future will not be desktops, tablets, or even phones.

14:02.600 --> 14:10.720
It will be the internet of things, just like the Intel Edison, an SD card sized computer

14:10.720 --> 14:12.780
which is about as strong as a Pentium 4.

14:12.780 --> 14:13.780
Think about it.

14:13.780 --> 14:16.680
A couple of generations of that, and you could make anything a phone.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.680
It's a good point.

14:18.680 --> 14:19.680
That's a really good point.

14:19.680 --> 14:22.360
And I think that he nailed it when he said there's always going to be a couple of people

14:22.360 --> 14:24.640
out of every town that are running Linux.

14:24.640 --> 14:31.720
I walk into my local grocery store with my rocking new sweatshirt, and I'll tell you,

14:31.720 --> 14:35.440
I had a couple of people, one person did recognize the show and kind of freaked out a little

14:35.440 --> 14:36.440
bit.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.440
No way, really?

14:37.440 --> 14:38.440
Cool.

14:38.440 --> 14:39.440
Yeah.

14:39.440 --> 14:40.440
The other person recognized the Penguin and the Linux.

14:40.440 --> 14:41.440
That was kind of cool, too.

14:41.440 --> 14:47.280
So it's awesome that it all takes a couple of people to really help the growth happen,

14:47.280 --> 14:48.280
I think.

14:48.280 --> 14:49.280
Yeah.

14:49.280 --> 14:55.440
And I think, too, we are stuck in an old generation's way of thinking where Microsoft and we're

14:55.440 --> 14:57.520
thinking in the old paradigm.

14:57.520 --> 15:02.160
And I think school districts are and all of the people that are making decisions on curriculum

15:02.160 --> 15:03.160
are.

15:03.160 --> 15:06.960
But the reality is, and this is why I've been, this is really what makes me excited about

15:06.960 --> 15:14.640
Linux is not what it is today, but the fact that as technology becomes more general purpose

15:14.640 --> 15:19.120
and these market leaders who were creating these specific technology empires like AIX

15:19.120 --> 15:24.800
and System 390, etc., as they begin to fade, the general purpose technology that is cheaper

15:24.800 --> 15:28.840
to implement, is more economical, more people have expertise on it, is easily deployable,

15:28.840 --> 15:34.000
it has a lot of flexibility, that type of technology replaces those special one-off

15:34.000 --> 15:38.360
tier types of technologies and Linux eventually ends up everywhere.

15:38.360 --> 15:42.600
And this Internet of Things is a cute way of calling it that, but that's what it is.

15:42.600 --> 15:48.360
And Linux will become relevant because everything will be running Linux that is a general technology

15:48.360 --> 15:49.400
component.

15:49.400 --> 15:55.440
And I think it's going to take a long time for schools to sort of work in how that's

15:55.440 --> 15:57.840
incorporated into their curriculum.

15:57.840 --> 16:01.680
And maybe it's through things like more like using the web browser and things like that.

16:01.680 --> 16:07.880
I don't know exactly, but what we have today is a reflection of the old computer industry

16:07.880 --> 16:13.080
and for better or worse, that industry is going through major redefinitions.

16:13.080 --> 16:21.080
I just read a stat recently that average Joe and Jane Americans, like 70% of their computing

16:21.080 --> 16:24.680
now is done on their quote-unquote tablets or smart devices.

16:24.680 --> 16:25.680
Isn't that wild?

16:25.680 --> 16:28.000
I mean, when you really, because you hear it and it kind of, you know, you don't really

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
think anything of it.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
It doesn't seem possible.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Right.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.360
When you're walking down the street, you go to a, maybe a, I don't know, a doctor's office

16:34.360 --> 16:38.560
and you see tablets and phones, it's like a lot of these people are doing work from

16:38.560 --> 16:39.560
these devices.

16:39.560 --> 16:43.800
When you think about it, because the availability is higher, so they've always got it, right?

16:43.800 --> 16:45.560
They've always got it with them so they can whip it out.

16:45.560 --> 16:49.600
So there's more, the frequency goes up because they're whipping it out, man.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.600
They're just whipping it out.

16:50.600 --> 16:51.600
Whipping it out.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.600
That thing is flopping around all over the place.

16:52.600 --> 16:55.000
And I'll tell you those tablets and phones are in action.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
That's right.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.720
But there are also, they're simpler and they're easier and they're faster in a lot of senses

17:00.720 --> 17:02.360
and they have less trouble.

17:02.360 --> 17:07.040
So there's less resistance to just, I'll just grab it and check the Facebook feed real quick.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.040
And it does make sense.

17:08.040 --> 17:11.060
And maybe those computing activities that they're doing on those devices aren't all

17:11.060 --> 17:12.060
that important.

17:12.060 --> 17:15.640
They're not creating something, you know, they're not developing something, but it's

17:15.640 --> 17:17.080
still usage.

17:17.080 --> 17:19.760
And I think at the end of the day, that's what has Microsoft freaked out right now.

17:19.760 --> 17:20.760
Oh yeah.

17:20.760 --> 17:21.760
All right.

17:21.760 --> 17:25.360
Our last bit of feedback this week comes in from Dakota.

17:25.360 --> 17:30.100
Dakota writes in about Linux in schools and says, I'm 15 years old and I've been using

17:30.100 --> 17:31.360
Linux for a year now.

17:31.360 --> 17:35.280
I've done stuff from write my own code to compiling a custom kernel on Ubuntu.

17:35.280 --> 17:40.200
I think we as a community should start a petition to get open source into more schools.

17:40.200 --> 17:44.120
And like you talked about on Unplugged with the same other teens, I think the schools

17:44.120 --> 17:48.720
should actually teach you something useful in the computer in IT classes.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.960
It's really sad when there are kids out there like me who can teach the class better than

17:51.960 --> 17:52.960
a teacher.

17:52.960 --> 17:57.680
You know, that sentiment of teaching the class better than the teacher, which can come across

17:57.680 --> 18:02.720
a little bit like the youngster knowing more than the teacher and these damn kids.

18:02.720 --> 18:08.700
But in the same sense, I remember one of the reasons I wasn't super spun up about taking

18:08.700 --> 18:15.080
more college level courses is because I quickly felt like I was outflanking my teachers and

18:15.080 --> 18:16.080
knew more than they did.

18:16.080 --> 18:20.140
And it was frustrating when the teacher would incorrectly cover something or say something

18:20.140 --> 18:25.760
wrong or use the wrong terminology or write system D with a capital D. Bad example.

18:25.760 --> 18:26.760
But you know what I'm saying.

18:26.760 --> 18:29.920
It is very frustrating for these students.

18:29.920 --> 18:33.440
So and it's interesting because we got a lot more emails than the ones I just read on air

18:33.440 --> 18:36.040
and a lot of them iterated that point.

18:36.040 --> 18:37.040
And there's a frustration there.

18:37.040 --> 18:42.020
It seems like a trend of young people saying, hey, you know, don't give up on our generation.

18:42.020 --> 18:43.020
We're here.

18:43.020 --> 18:44.020
We're talking.

18:44.020 --> 18:45.020
We're sharing.

18:45.020 --> 18:47.560
We're teaching others that are willing to learn, maybe not the teachers, but you know,

18:47.560 --> 18:48.560
certainly other students.

18:48.560 --> 18:52.440
I'm almost coming to the conclusion that I think the future of Linux on the desktop in

18:52.440 --> 18:56.120
a non-enterprise situations, perhaps at home, will be with young people.

18:56.120 --> 19:00.000
I think that much like how Firefox had its adoption spread, I think it's going to be

19:00.000 --> 19:03.160
young people that make it interesting, like mom and dad screwed up the computer.

19:03.160 --> 19:06.560
Let me replace the OS with something that works just like these two at the browser.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.120
Be like, oh, mom and dad, you're not using Firefox.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.120
This is what your problem is.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.120
Let me fix that for you.

19:10.120 --> 19:11.120
Right.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.120
Yeah, yeah.

19:12.120 --> 19:13.120
You know what?

19:13.120 --> 19:14.120
You might be right about that, Matt.

19:14.120 --> 19:19.440
I would say, too, when I think about this, you know, looking at these these kids that

19:19.440 --> 19:26.080
are really smart, I think that really there's two things that we have to realize is that

19:26.080 --> 19:31.720
younger Linux users will find resources that we have out there for the adults like these

19:31.720 --> 19:32.720
shows.

19:32.720 --> 19:35.040
Like these shows, like when we make these, you know, we don't really have a specific

19:35.040 --> 19:38.520
age group in mind, but we're definitely not trying to target a younger demographic.

19:38.520 --> 19:43.360
But yet they still, obviously we have an audience that they, you know, they represent a percentage

19:43.360 --> 19:45.720
of the audience that's noticeable.

19:45.720 --> 19:49.360
And they are finding the same resources that we create for adults.

19:49.360 --> 19:52.940
And I don't think we have to get in this mindset that we have to do something very special

19:52.940 --> 19:53.940
for the kids.

19:53.940 --> 20:00.440
I think smart, savvy kids that are told it is okay, self-education is an okay thing.

20:00.440 --> 20:05.480
If we can, you know, because a lot of kids, I felt when I was in school, I felt the Internet

20:05.480 --> 20:06.480
was new, right?

20:06.480 --> 20:07.600
And it was untrusted.

20:07.600 --> 20:13.600
And there was pushback from my teachers when I would self-research and self-educate.

20:13.600 --> 20:14.780
Like you can't rely on that.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.440
You don't know if you're teaching yourself the right thing.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.700
You're not smart enough to figure it out on your own.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.980
You need our guidance is really what they were saying.

20:21.980 --> 20:26.600
And now looking back on that, I resent that because self-education is a fantastic tool

20:26.600 --> 20:29.960
and the Internet empowers people to teach themselves things on their own in their own

20:29.960 --> 20:30.960
room.

20:30.960 --> 20:31.960
Don't you think?

20:31.960 --> 20:35.880
I think you really nailed on something there even bigger than just the experiences that

20:35.880 --> 20:36.880
you had.

20:36.880 --> 20:41.800
I think the problem is it represented the changing of a guard to where it was no longer

20:41.800 --> 20:44.120
teachers who were the teachers essentially.

20:44.120 --> 20:47.760
I mean they no longer were the power player or had all the knowledge that there's this

20:47.760 --> 20:53.560
new thing that kids were quite frankly more adept to than the adults were.

20:53.560 --> 20:58.320
I was at that time when this was happening I was pretty much on my own and out of school

20:58.320 --> 21:02.400
and whatnot but I witnessed this happening a lot just in society that there seemed to

21:02.400 --> 21:03.580
be a real shift.

21:03.580 --> 21:06.600
And so I think that that's probably a lot of what you were experiencing.

21:06.600 --> 21:07.600
Yeah.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.140
And I think maybe that could still be there could be a little bit of that still in play

21:10.140 --> 21:14.720
today because some of those same teachers are still in and they really are.

21:14.720 --> 21:20.060
So I think if we tell these teenagers and kids that hey dude and dudette it's fine.

21:20.060 --> 21:22.000
Go out there and learn on your own.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Go teach yourself.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.640
You don't have to have somebody's blessing to become educated on a topic.

21:27.640 --> 21:28.640
That's right.

21:28.640 --> 21:29.640
So all right.

21:29.640 --> 21:38.100
So that wraps up our specific email feedback but I did have a little Valve update.

21:38.100 --> 21:43.300
So we've been covering the evolving Valve story here on Linux Unplugged and big story

21:43.300 --> 21:49.160
broke out actually just a couple of days ago that Valve was apparently monitoring people's

21:49.160 --> 21:53.480
DNS cache and then parsing out where you had gone.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.960
Anybody in the mumble room did you catch this whole story where Valve was supposedly looking

21:56.960 --> 22:00.560
at people's… first it came out Valve was looking at your browsing history and they

22:00.560 --> 22:03.360
were monitoring your browsing history and then it came out oh they're not monitoring

22:03.360 --> 22:05.880
your browsing history they're looking at your DNS cache.

22:05.880 --> 22:07.060
Did you guys hear this story?

22:07.060 --> 22:08.240
Anybody here familiar with this?

22:08.240 --> 22:09.240
Yes.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.920
And also Gabe went to Reddit to kind of set it straight.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.120
Now that was the interesting twist here.

22:14.120 --> 22:20.320
So the way… so just to fill some of you guys in on the background I guess Valve has

22:20.320 --> 22:25.600
been in this cold war, not even a cold war, a war with these cheats.

22:25.600 --> 22:32.200
He wrote, Gabe wrote on Reddit there are a number of kernel level paid cheats relative

22:32.200 --> 22:33.200
to this Reddit thread.

22:33.200 --> 22:36.580
He links to the thread about a bunch of these kernel level cheats where like in Windows

22:36.580 --> 22:38.960
it's almost like you know it's almost like malware in a sense.

22:38.960 --> 22:42.760
He says, cheat developers have a problem getting cheaters to actually pay them for all the

22:42.760 --> 22:44.120
obvious reasons.

22:44.120 --> 22:50.320
So they start creating their own DRM and anti-cheat codes for their own cheats.

22:50.320 --> 22:55.240
The cheats phone home to a DRM server that confirms that the cheater is actually paid

22:55.240 --> 22:56.520
to use the cheat.

22:56.520 --> 23:01.040
Now they have this program called VAC, V-A-C, it's a checker for the presence of these

23:01.040 --> 23:02.040
cheats.

23:02.040 --> 23:07.680
If they were detected, VAC then checked to see which cheat DRM server was being contacted.

23:07.680 --> 23:11.080
Now here's how they do it and this is the part that got people upset.

23:11.080 --> 23:17.800
The second check was done by looking at a partial match to those cheat DRM servers in

23:17.800 --> 23:19.840
the DNS cache.

23:19.840 --> 23:25.340
It found then hashes of the matching DNS entries were sent to the VAC servers.

23:25.340 --> 23:29.320
The matches double checked on our server, this is Gabe talking, and the client then

23:29.320 --> 23:31.920
marked it for, then the client was then marked for a future ban.

23:31.920 --> 23:36.880
He says by the way less than one percent of clients, less than a tenth of one percent

23:36.880 --> 23:40.440
of clients triggered the second check.

23:40.440 --> 23:44.280
But this was, well hey, so wait a minute, Valve has been checking my DNS cache and then

23:44.280 --> 23:45.680
doing hashes of it?

23:45.680 --> 23:46.680
I didn't know this.

23:46.680 --> 23:47.680
It's like they only read part of that, right?

23:47.680 --> 23:50.020
But I mean they're not getting the deeper reasoning, so it's interesting.

23:50.020 --> 23:54.440
It appears like there's a really big back and forth thing going on here and I just wondered,

23:54.440 --> 23:59.400
did anybody in the mumble room feel like Valve has crossed a line by doing this DNS cache

23:59.400 --> 24:00.400
checking?

24:00.400 --> 24:01.400
No.

24:01.400 --> 24:06.320
It was first reported, but then when it was explained, it wasn't as bad as it first seemed.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.320
Yeah.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.320
Yeah.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.320
The whole thing is…

24:09.320 --> 24:10.320
Go ahead, Rodden.

24:10.320 --> 24:13.840
People thought that they were checking it, so if you just happened to go to the server,

24:13.840 --> 24:18.840
you would get banned, but the second check is what explained that it wasn't doing that.

24:18.840 --> 24:23.200
So even if you went to the servers for the cheat, you weren't being logged for doing

24:23.200 --> 24:24.200
it.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.200
Okay, yeah.

24:25.200 --> 24:28.640
And I mean it's a hash too of the DNS cache, is that what you were going to say, Webby?

24:28.640 --> 24:29.640
Webwizard?

24:29.640 --> 24:38.600
No, I was just going to… I think they really needed to go and just be more forthcoming,

24:38.600 --> 24:43.240
so that when people go and say, oh, look at what I found, and everyone just explodes,

24:43.240 --> 24:45.640
start pointing fingers saying, oh, it must be doing something bad.

24:45.640 --> 24:49.960
Well, I mean, before we go too far, I mean, Crash, don't you think that people are just

24:49.960 --> 24:53.960
kind of taking Valve on their word on this whole thing a little too much?

24:53.960 --> 24:58.920
That's exactly what I was just going to say, is that Gabe went and made a statement in

24:58.920 --> 25:03.240
which he basically said, well, you know, you've got to trust us, and we don't want to break

25:03.240 --> 25:04.240
your trust.

25:04.240 --> 25:07.800
Yeah, trust us, just like Obama says.

25:07.800 --> 25:12.540
He basically said, trust us, because if we were doing something bad, how would that look

25:12.540 --> 25:13.540
for us and everything?

25:13.540 --> 25:19.520
But at the moment, all we have is his word that that's all it's doing, and that it

25:19.520 --> 25:22.560
isn't going to be used for anything worse, which, okay, there's no evidence that it

25:22.560 --> 25:29.200
is doing anything worse, but we also know that the capability to scan your DNS cache

25:29.200 --> 25:35.120
and send hashes of it exists in their software that only they can control, because they send

25:35.120 --> 25:39.960
updates to Steam, and they're all closed source, and there's nothing, you can't check those

25:39.960 --> 25:44.440
to make sure that it isn't doing anything else, so we've got Gabe's word, and he seems

25:44.440 --> 25:47.920
like a trustworthy guy, but how do we know that?

25:47.920 --> 25:52.680
I mean, lots of people seem trustworthy before this note, and leaks came out, so.

25:52.680 --> 25:55.400
Rich Faye, what do you think this means for our state of privacy?

25:55.400 --> 26:00.960
Well, I mean, maybe it's just this constant state of talking about it, but there's so

26:00.960 --> 26:06.360
many companies that are ripping off your data online now, I mean, Google's the big player

26:06.360 --> 26:12.320
there, that Valve seems like a pretty reputable company, and at least for me, I think I'm

26:12.320 --> 26:16.980
going to take them at their word until I see a reason not to, just because it's just so

26:16.980 --> 26:21.040
prevalent nowadays that, I mean, you can't just lock yourself in a room and not connect

26:21.040 --> 26:22.040
to the internet.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.040
Yeah, that's true.

26:23.040 --> 26:26.760
Well, Ick, it sounds like you think this is a little bit, it came down to disclosure versus

26:26.760 --> 26:33.320
PR, but could Valve really properly disclose this without then disclosing to the cheaters

26:33.320 --> 26:35.680
how they're checking and catching them?

26:35.680 --> 26:37.680
Well, not exactly.

26:37.680 --> 26:42.560
What I'm thinking is, you know, if they would just disclose that there could be the possibility

26:42.560 --> 26:48.000
of something like this happening, just a little bit of disclosure can solve a whole slew of

26:48.000 --> 26:51.400
the PR problems that would happen in the wake of that.

26:51.400 --> 26:52.400
Yeah.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.400
You know what I'm saying?

26:53.400 --> 26:54.400
Yeah, I do.

26:54.400 --> 26:55.400
I mean, I'm glad...

26:55.400 --> 26:56.400
Why does the operating system let it happen?

26:56.400 --> 26:57.640
Well, that's a great question.

26:57.640 --> 27:01.360
Why is there functionality to look in the DNS cache and see what's there?

27:01.360 --> 27:03.760
Maybe to retrieve something from the cache, like if you want to...

27:03.760 --> 27:04.760
That doesn't make any sense.

27:04.760 --> 27:06.760
Like, the whole, it's supposed to be transparent, right?

27:06.760 --> 27:11.120
You go to look something up and if it's cache it, yay, but why should you be able to see

27:11.120 --> 27:13.240
what other programs have been looking up?

27:13.240 --> 27:16.360
Yeah, maybe you can specifically look one particular thing up, but you shouldn't be

27:16.360 --> 27:18.160
able to see what all of the entries are.

27:18.160 --> 27:19.160
Right.

27:19.160 --> 27:22.560
Well, you look something up and you might be able to tell by how fast the result comes

27:22.560 --> 27:26.080
back, whether it was a cache hit or not, as like a timing attack, but you shouldn't be

27:26.080 --> 27:29.000
able to just see what's in the cache.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.600
And I'm not sure that they actually can, so I'm not sure exactly...

27:32.600 --> 27:33.600
It could be disinformation.

27:33.600 --> 27:34.600
Yeah.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.600
Well, not disinformation.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.600
It's just, you know, a bad explanation.

27:36.600 --> 27:37.600
The PR is full of those all the time.

27:37.600 --> 27:40.640
Yeah, and I wonder if this is a Windows-specific thing.

27:40.640 --> 27:44.440
I wonder if they even can do this under the Linux client.

27:44.440 --> 27:49.480
Yeah, like I wouldn't imagine there's some way to browse the DNS cache on a Linux client,

27:49.480 --> 27:50.480
right?

27:50.480 --> 27:51.480
Yeah.

27:51.480 --> 27:52.800
I'm not familiar, but yeah, it's very interesting.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.360
So we'll keep following it.

27:54.360 --> 27:55.360
We'll keep watching it.

27:55.360 --> 27:56.360
I just thought...

27:56.360 --> 27:57.360
Oh, go ahead.

27:57.360 --> 28:03.120
We thought they could have something built into SteamOS now because they're rolling that

28:03.120 --> 28:07.720
out and I'm not sure if they've released open source code.

28:07.720 --> 28:10.680
So I mean, they could eventually build something into that.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.880
I mean, I think people will be able to tell if they're, you know, they could look at the

28:12.880 --> 28:17.000
difference between the Debian version of, you know, LibDNS or whatever it is versus

28:17.000 --> 28:18.920
the SteamOS version.

28:18.920 --> 28:23.960
But it is, it does, your overall point is a good one in that them having their own operating

28:23.960 --> 28:28.320
system opens them up to the possibilities of just baking these kinds of nice little

28:28.320 --> 28:29.400
features in.

28:29.400 --> 28:33.200
It definitely makes you take a pause and go, okay, I do need to remember that Valve is

28:33.200 --> 28:37.220
a company and that they have their own motivations and that I need to be skeptical.

28:37.220 --> 28:41.320
And I think that's a good healthy thing for all of us to think about right now.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.520
But I definitely think so.

28:42.520 --> 28:46.880
I think one thing to remember and first and foremost, never trust anything from any company.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.500
That's just a good rule of thumb.

28:48.500 --> 28:54.080
But that being said, I also look at motivation and how recent they are to a new market.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.700
So I take Valve, like they're very recent to the Linux market.

28:56.700 --> 28:58.240
So they're pretty new here.

28:58.240 --> 29:01.400
Their motivation is to capture as many new users as possible.

29:01.400 --> 29:04.840
And so pissing people off early on probably isn't a great game plan.

29:04.840 --> 29:09.120
So based on those things at this point, I don't see anything with them doing anything

29:09.120 --> 29:10.120
nefarious at this point.

29:10.120 --> 29:11.560
That doesn't mean in the future.

29:11.560 --> 29:12.560
But just saying.

29:12.560 --> 29:14.640
I'll link to Gabe's full post in the show notes.

29:14.640 --> 29:19.560
But one of the interesting things he said is that this little trick that they discovered

29:19.560 --> 29:25.320
that they came up with only worked for 13 days until the cheat authors came up with

29:25.320 --> 29:27.440
a new way to do it by purging the DNS cache.

29:27.440 --> 29:32.180
Yeah, now the cheats just purged the DNS cache, which overall impacts your performance.

29:32.180 --> 29:34.200
So that kind of sucks, you know?

29:34.200 --> 29:35.200
All right, Matt.

29:35.200 --> 29:37.680
Well, we're going to talk to Michael Hall here in just a second about a really great

29:37.680 --> 29:43.480
post that he just had called the new 80-20 open source to, what did he call it?

29:43.480 --> 29:44.480
Let's see.

29:44.480 --> 29:49.380
He called it the new 80-20 rule for open source, which was a great post.

29:49.380 --> 29:51.040
So we're going to talk to him here in just a sec.

29:51.040 --> 29:55.480
But first, I want to thank our second sponsor this week, and that is the amazing folks over

29:55.480 --> 29:56.480
at Ting.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.440
Now, I've told you a lot about Ting.

29:58.440 --> 29:59.440
Ting is mobile.

29:59.440 --> 30:00.440
It makes sense.

30:00.440 --> 30:01.440
It's no contracts.

30:01.440 --> 30:02.440
It's pay for what you use.

30:02.440 --> 30:06.320
I actually thought this week maybe I'd have one of their fantastic Canadians tell you

30:06.320 --> 30:07.720
a little bit about it.

30:07.720 --> 30:09.280
Ting keeps rates simple.

30:09.280 --> 30:10.600
We don't make you pick a plan.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.280
Instead, you just use your phone as you normally would.

30:13.280 --> 30:16.360
How much you use determines how much you pay each month.

30:16.360 --> 30:19.200
You can have as many devices as you want on one account.

30:19.200 --> 30:23.360
That's good, because when you use more, you pay less per minute, message, or megabyte

30:23.360 --> 30:24.360
of data.

30:24.360 --> 30:29.600
Your usage plus $6 per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill.

30:29.600 --> 30:30.600
Simple.

30:30.600 --> 30:34.400
That's what we mean when we say, Ting, mobile.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.400
That makes sense.

30:35.400 --> 30:39.320
Yeah, so go over to linux.ting.com to check them out.

30:39.320 --> 30:41.040
They've got a really awesome dashboard.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.560
I think all mobile carriers need to step up their game now.

30:43.560 --> 30:46.960
Ting has schooled everybody on how your dashboard should work.

30:46.960 --> 30:49.100
Web standards, so it works on your mobile device.

30:49.100 --> 30:50.100
It works on your desktop.

30:50.100 --> 30:53.200
They've also got iOS and Android apps that let you manage your account.

30:53.200 --> 30:56.520
You can set up call forwarding, voicemail options, stuff like that.

30:56.520 --> 30:59.100
They've got a really, really great customer service.

30:59.100 --> 31:05.440
You can call them at 1-855-846-4389, and if you call them during business hours, a real

31:05.440 --> 31:09.240
person answers the phone right then and there and takes care of your problem.

31:09.240 --> 31:13.880
They've got some videos on their blog, too, some behind-the-scenes videos on the crew

31:13.880 --> 31:18.000
that works in the support department, so you get a little idea of... Them Canadians, they're

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
so nice, Matt.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
They're so nice.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
They just posted one, I think, today.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Yeah, today.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.560
Yeah, I think it was today.

31:24.560 --> 31:26.920
Yeah, so that video is up on the Ting blog.

31:26.920 --> 31:30.280
While you're over at linux.ting.com, check out their savings calculator, because Ting

31:30.280 --> 31:31.640
just dropped their rates.

31:31.640 --> 31:36.120
The Ting deal is even better for data now, so go over there, plug in your current bill

31:36.120 --> 31:39.640
information, and then just weep at the savings, my friends, because you'll be like, oh my

31:39.640 --> 31:44.160
god, it's so much better, and oh, there's no contract, oh, I only pay for what I use,

31:44.160 --> 31:46.700
oh, hotspot and tethering are included, oh my goodness.

31:46.700 --> 31:49.600
By the way, they also have an early termination relief program.

31:49.600 --> 31:52.360
You can find out more about that at ting.com slash ETF.

31:52.360 --> 31:56.000
Get started by going to linux.ting.com, and that'll let them know that you heard about

31:56.000 --> 31:59.800
it right here on the Unplugged Show, you appreciate them supporting the Unplugged Show, and my

31:59.800 --> 32:03.960
friends, they'll get you $25 off your first device.

32:03.960 --> 32:06.920
If you've already got a Sprint compatible device and they've got a BYOD page that outlines

32:06.920 --> 32:11.240
everything, well then good news, they'll give you $25 off your first month, and if

32:11.240 --> 32:15.360
you're like me, that actually ended up paying for my first month of Ting, and I really

32:15.360 --> 32:16.360
love it.

32:16.360 --> 32:20.200
I just, we were out, I can say this now, oh, I can talk about this now.

32:20.200 --> 32:25.560
So Matt, Chase, and I were out in the car, right, and we're driving around, and Chase

32:25.560 --> 32:31.020
doesn't have Ting, right, because he originally had an iPhone, and he wanted to, he has another

32:31.020 --> 32:34.000
mobile carrier who likes to spy on you and give all your information to the government

32:34.000 --> 32:36.640
and extract as much money from you as possible.

32:36.640 --> 32:41.400
Anyways, that carrier is pretty well known, so Chase says, well, let's do a speed test

32:41.400 --> 32:45.240
and see where we're at, and so we both bring up the speed test app.

32:45.240 --> 32:49.920
I had perfectly good pings, perfectly good speeds, and I'll tell you, I'm paying $33

32:49.920 --> 32:54.980
a month, Chase is paying like $120 a month, we both have two phones on the account, so

32:54.980 --> 33:01.640
the value in Ting is just incredible, so linux.ting.com, and thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux

33:01.640 --> 33:02.640
Action Show.

33:02.640 --> 33:03.640
I'm just kidding, Chase.

33:03.640 --> 33:04.640
I know.

33:04.640 --> 33:05.640
He's like, hey!

33:05.640 --> 33:08.520
He's like, hey, come on now, come on now, no, Chase, it's cool, it's cool, man, it's

33:08.520 --> 33:09.520
cool.

33:09.520 --> 33:14.680
Alright, well, let me bring Michael Hall into our restricted casting room here, and Michael,

33:14.680 --> 33:17.000
welcome to Linux Unplugged.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Thank you, guys.

33:18.000 --> 33:24.120
So you had a really great post this morning on your blog, emhall119.com, and you said

33:24.120 --> 33:28.240
it's a new 80-20 rule for open source, so before we get into that, I noticed, are you

33:28.240 --> 33:30.760
trying to do like a blog a day kind of a thing right now?

33:30.760 --> 33:37.120
Yeah, there was some conversation at the end of January about the content going on on Ubuntu

33:37.120 --> 33:41.960
Planet, and I came up with this, well, I didn't come up with it, I stole this idea of doing

33:41.960 --> 33:43.400
a blog a day for a month.

33:43.400 --> 33:47.760
So you're hoping to sort of populate the Ubuntu planet with some reoccurring content every

33:47.760 --> 33:49.360
day kind of a thing?

33:49.360 --> 33:54.160
Yeah, I was just trying to get people to kind of blog more actively on it.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.440
So what do you do at Canonical?

33:56.440 --> 34:02.500
Well, as you mentioned earlier, my official title is Upstream Liaison, but I really haven't

34:02.500 --> 34:07.200
been doing a lot of upstream liaising lately, I've been doing a lot of app developer focus.

34:07.200 --> 34:11.120
Uh-huh, yeah, I bet, as you guys are ramping up the Ubuntu Touch effort, right?

34:11.120 --> 34:15.500
Yeah, and the Ubuntu SDK, it's really a lot of exciting stuff going on.

34:15.500 --> 34:19.280
What has got you most excited right now?

34:19.280 --> 34:21.480
Everything around the app development and the phone.

34:21.480 --> 34:26.280
I mean, I've got a Nexus 4 that's running Ubuntu, and it's been my primary phone since

34:26.280 --> 34:28.200
August of last year.

34:28.200 --> 34:35.560
And just the workflow using the phone is so much better for me than what Android was.

34:35.560 --> 34:38.120
So is that really, I mean, the essence of that is, you know, because so many people

34:38.120 --> 34:42.200
when we talk about the mobile market, so many people talk about, oh, you know, Android's

34:42.200 --> 34:46.600
there, they're the new Windows, they're dominant, the market's all locked down, but you're telling

34:46.600 --> 34:49.640
me that you sit there, you're using this thing, you're like, you know what?

34:49.640 --> 34:50.760
This works for me?

34:50.760 --> 34:51.760
And that's what's got you excited?

34:51.760 --> 34:55.960
It's like, I see this fitting into my workflow, and do you think this is like a whole new

34:55.960 --> 34:59.080
generation of opportunity for Ubuntu?

34:59.080 --> 35:00.080
I think it is.

35:00.080 --> 35:04.440
The one, the thing we have over everybody else in the market right now is that we're

35:04.440 --> 35:08.020
running the same software on the phone as we are on the desktop.

35:08.020 --> 35:12.560
So it's not like, you know, you've got completely different platforms like you do with the iOS

35:12.560 --> 35:16.920
and OSX, or even Windows and Windows Phone, and of course, you know, Android, there's

35:16.920 --> 35:22.160
not even anything on a desktop space with Android, there's Chrome OS.

35:22.160 --> 35:26.560
So being able to have just the one platform on all the devices, being able to have the

35:26.560 --> 35:31.760
same apps on all your devices is really, it really changes the experience of it.

35:31.760 --> 35:37.200
So changing gears to your blog post here, I know you've been active at Canonical for

35:37.200 --> 35:41.080
a long time, you've been in the open source community for, do you have a rough estimation

35:41.080 --> 35:43.880
of like how long you've been in?

35:43.880 --> 35:49.600
I've been involved with the Ubuntu community for probably six, seven years now.

35:49.600 --> 35:54.440
And so you've had time from that perspective to sort of notice trends as they come and

35:54.440 --> 35:58.720
go, you know, the big hoopla's of the week that sometimes last multiple weeks, sometimes

35:58.720 --> 36:03.100
fizzle out fairly quick, and I thought, you know, you had a really poignant piece when

36:03.100 --> 36:07.480
you wrote here on your blog, people tend to appreciate it more when you only give them

36:07.480 --> 36:13.120
20% of something, and then they resent you if you give them 80%.

36:13.120 --> 36:14.680
Let's unpack that a little bit.

36:14.680 --> 36:19.400
When you say people resent you, people appreciate it more when you give them 20%, that sounds

36:19.400 --> 36:20.600
crazy to me.

36:20.600 --> 36:24.480
That sounds ludicrous, what do you mean by that?

36:24.480 --> 36:30.360
It does sound ludicrous, but what I realized is that at some point past the 50% mark, I

36:30.360 --> 36:35.520
just chose 80-20 because, you know, the 80-20 rule's a common thing, but at some point after

36:35.520 --> 36:40.440
you've given them more than half, people start to think of it as something that they're entitled

36:40.440 --> 36:43.180
to or something that already belongs to them.

36:43.180 --> 36:46.400
And so instead of looking at what you're giving them, they're paying more attention to what

36:46.400 --> 36:47.920
you're not giving them.

36:47.920 --> 36:49.260
Oh, interesting.

36:49.260 --> 36:55.960
So it's sort of like what Matt was saying, it's one part expectations and two part what

36:55.960 --> 36:57.440
have you done for me lately?

36:57.440 --> 36:59.240
Yeah, it is.

36:59.240 --> 37:03.340
And as people have mentioned on my blog, there's another aspect of that and that's, you know,

37:03.340 --> 37:05.120
what direction are you changing in?

37:05.120 --> 37:11.720
I mean, if somebody goes from giving 10% to giving 20%, that's better than somebody who's

37:11.720 --> 37:15.080
gone from giving 90% to giving 80%.

37:15.080 --> 37:20.300
And that's a valid criticism of my original blog post is that the direction of change

37:20.300 --> 37:23.280
does matter as much as where you're currently at.

37:23.280 --> 37:24.280
Sure, sure.

37:24.280 --> 37:30.780
But I think this is fascinating in the recent light of Firefox's announcement of enabling

37:30.780 --> 37:33.560
ads on their new tab page.

37:33.560 --> 37:37.880
And part of it, like Matt made a very good point last on Sunday, that part of it is honestly

37:37.880 --> 37:39.560
how they announced it.

37:39.560 --> 37:45.080
And part of it is, I think, what the phenomenon that you're writing about on your blog is

37:45.080 --> 37:48.880
that, wait a minute, you're telling me I've gotten this thing all this time for absolutely

37:48.880 --> 37:50.100
free, with no ads attached.

37:50.100 --> 37:55.320
You guys are the anti NSA, anti ad tracking cookie organization on the internet and now

37:55.320 --> 37:57.520
you want to ram ads down my throat?

37:57.520 --> 38:00.000
How dare you?

38:00.000 --> 38:06.160
This maybe while it doesn't surprise all of us, Michael, how do you combat something like

38:06.160 --> 38:07.160
that?

38:07.160 --> 38:08.160
Because Firefox has got to make money.

38:08.160 --> 38:11.200
What can Firefox do?

38:11.200 --> 38:12.560
It's really a tough question.

38:12.560 --> 38:17.640
I mean, obviously, it's a question that we've been trying to figure out in Canonical also.

38:17.640 --> 38:20.620
And I think a lot of it is getting the messaging right.

38:20.620 --> 38:24.720
But a lot of it is just the community needs to understand that every project is going

38:24.720 --> 38:26.720
to have missteps.

38:26.720 --> 38:32.800
And if somebody's been doing 80, 90 percent right for so long, you have to be a little

38:32.800 --> 38:35.240
more gentle when they have those missteps.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.200
Well, let me give you an example.

38:37.200 --> 38:45.680
So Linux Unplugged, this very show that we are currently recording at this very moment,

38:45.680 --> 38:48.880
is a symptom of this problem that you're talking about.

38:48.880 --> 38:55.440
I knew that I needed to make changes, even just from a creative expression standpoint,

38:55.440 --> 38:57.160
to the Linux Action Show.

38:57.160 --> 39:01.440
But I also knew that we had a really great product that was firing on all cylinders and

39:01.440 --> 39:03.600
has a ton of runway still.

39:03.600 --> 39:09.960
And I knew that if I changed that product to what this show is, there would be massive

39:09.960 --> 39:11.320
upset.

39:11.320 --> 39:14.880
And so my solution was to create an entirely new product.

39:14.880 --> 39:20.520
Now that has been wildly successful for multiple reasons, but it was exactly this kind of pressure.

39:20.520 --> 39:25.120
And we made the mistake years ago with the Linux Action Show when we decided to broaden

39:25.120 --> 39:28.340
the scope and change it to the Computer Action Show.

39:28.340 --> 39:34.960
And we basically took a beating for an entire season over that decision because we had changed

39:34.960 --> 39:36.080
the product.

39:36.080 --> 39:41.640
And the problem is, at some times, at some level, you've got to change the product.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.280
Apple, they changed the product with Final Cut.

39:44.280 --> 39:46.400
They changed the product with the Mac Pro, right?

39:46.400 --> 39:52.120
Two recent products from Apple that are used in professional industries, completely gutted

39:52.120 --> 39:55.480
and redesigned from the ground up with less functionality.

39:55.480 --> 39:58.920
But yet, in the long term, we'll probably be better off for it.

39:58.920 --> 40:02.480
As somebody who uses Final Cut for editing, I can tell you, everybody who uses Final Cut

40:02.480 --> 40:04.680
10 as crap hasn't used it recently.

40:04.680 --> 40:06.680
I just recently went back to the old Final Cut.

40:06.680 --> 40:07.920
It's like going back to the 90s.

40:07.920 --> 40:12.880
It's like when you've been using Gnome 3 or Unity and you go back to Gnome 2, it feels

40:12.880 --> 40:14.600
like you've gone back in time.

40:14.600 --> 40:20.340
And sometimes, a lopping off like this, a major change, implementing ads, implementing

40:20.340 --> 40:25.700
the Amazon search scope is necessary for the sustainability of the project.

40:25.700 --> 40:29.220
The very people who depend on the project are then the ones that turn around on the

40:29.220 --> 40:31.720
project and attack them.

40:31.720 --> 40:35.360
What can a project do, do you think, in your opinion, to communicate that change better

40:35.360 --> 40:39.900
so that way they can sort of preempt some of that attack?

40:39.900 --> 40:43.080
So a lot of it has to do with the messaging that goes into it.

40:43.080 --> 40:47.080
But another thing that I've noticed that I didn't really expand on in my blog is that

40:47.080 --> 40:52.920
there's a difference in reaction between people who are just users of the project and people

40:52.920 --> 40:55.360
who are contributors of the project.

40:55.360 --> 41:00.720
And people who are contributing seem to be more understanding, be more willing to work

41:00.720 --> 41:07.320
out an ideal solution instead of just jumping on the, oh my god, you're evil now, bandwagon.

41:07.320 --> 41:10.240
So I guess what I don't understand is why can a company, just giving you my example

41:10.240 --> 41:15.120
I set up here, why can a company like Apple reboot something, cut away tons of functionality

41:15.120 --> 41:16.760
and be called an innovator?

41:16.760 --> 41:20.760
But if an open source project does the same thing, they're crazy, they've lost their

41:20.760 --> 41:26.160
way, they're evil, they're whatever people are accusing Canonical or Mozilla of that

41:26.160 --> 41:27.160
week.

41:27.160 --> 41:32.580
It seems to me, Canonical has people that deal with PR, they've got a pretty good presence

41:32.580 --> 41:35.960
online and yet they have been unable to get in front of this.

41:35.960 --> 41:41.580
Mozilla, same thing, they have an entire crew that works there and they were still unable

41:41.580 --> 41:42.680
to get in front of this.

41:42.680 --> 41:45.760
Matt, I want to ask you, because I know you've worked in this space before, what are these

41:45.760 --> 41:47.560
people missing?

41:47.560 --> 41:49.160
What is Mozilla missing in this case?

41:49.160 --> 41:50.160
What did they do wrong?

41:50.160 --> 41:52.360
What should they have done before the news came out?

41:52.360 --> 41:57.880
Well, the big difference between Mozilla and Apple is Apple sells experiences, Mozilla

41:57.880 --> 41:58.880
offers a browser.

41:58.880 --> 42:02.680
A lot of people think that Apple is a computer company or a technology company.

42:02.680 --> 42:03.680
They're not.

42:03.680 --> 42:05.240
They're a PR company, pure and simple.

42:05.240 --> 42:09.960
They've mastered this years ago and so they could literally be like, hey, we have this

42:09.960 --> 42:12.800
iHome invasion thing where we're going to come in and basically invade your house and

42:12.800 --> 42:13.800
ransack everything you own.

42:13.800 --> 42:17.380
People are going to be excited about it because they can present it in a way that's attractive.

42:17.380 --> 42:22.360
What Mozilla needed to do when they came out with their whole advertising thing for browsers

42:22.360 --> 42:26.040
and whatnot is they really needed to get in front of this and say, here's our rationale,

42:26.040 --> 42:29.840
here's how we've been supporting ourselves thus far, here's what we're challenged with,

42:29.840 --> 42:31.560
this is what we're planning on doing.

42:31.560 --> 42:35.560
We would like to have an open forum debate about this and actually get all the questions

42:35.560 --> 42:39.600
out in the open and really have a conversation about it, but at the same time, we need you

42:39.600 --> 42:43.800
to understand why we're doing it, why it is or is not a threat, why you should or should

42:43.800 --> 42:47.800
not be concerned, and to quit treating people like they need to be talked at and actually

42:47.800 --> 42:48.960
talked to them.

42:48.960 --> 42:53.880
That's something that historically geekier companies don't do real well at.

42:53.880 --> 42:59.360
Google, Mozilla, two real big offenders in that space, probably Google being the worst.

42:59.360 --> 43:05.200
I see it over and over and it's something that's not really addressed very well.

43:05.200 --> 43:09.040
I've seen other companies do this as well, but I'd say Apple, honestly, as much as I'm

43:09.040 --> 43:11.480
not a big fan of their company, they can spin anything.

43:11.480 --> 43:12.480
Right.

43:12.480 --> 43:14.520
They control the narrative from the very beginning.

43:14.520 --> 43:15.520
Absolutely.

43:15.520 --> 43:16.520
And props to import.

43:16.520 --> 43:17.520
I mean, really.

43:17.520 --> 43:18.520
I mean, they know how to do it.

43:18.520 --> 43:21.640
So rather than everybody yelling at how horrible Apple is about it, let's look at what they're

43:21.640 --> 43:22.640
doing right.

43:22.640 --> 43:26.360
I mean, the products aren't kind of meh, but as far as their marketing techniques, come

43:26.360 --> 43:27.360
on.

43:27.360 --> 43:28.360
Let's get with it.

43:28.360 --> 43:32.760
So Michael, what do you think about like, so if we don't have the means and resources

43:32.760 --> 43:37.960
of a company like Apple, these smaller, even Mozilla would fall into the smaller category.

43:37.960 --> 43:41.200
What about being just more direct?

43:41.200 --> 43:43.240
And I'm not asking you as a representative of Canonical here.

43:43.240 --> 43:46.760
I'm asking just your personal opinion of somebody who's been following open source for many

43:46.760 --> 43:47.920
years now.

43:47.920 --> 43:51.780
Do you think that if a company like Canonical come out and said, hey, we're doing these

43:51.780 --> 43:57.020
Amazon placements in our dashboard results because honestly, we've got to generate a

43:57.020 --> 43:59.520
revenue from the desktop in order to keep it sustainable?

43:59.520 --> 44:03.000
Or if Mozilla had come out, maybe let's take a more recent example.

44:03.000 --> 44:07.280
If Mozilla had come out and said, look guys, we can't have all our eggs in the Google basket.

44:07.280 --> 44:11.580
We respect our relationship with Google and we appreciate the financing they've given

44:11.580 --> 44:17.160
us so far, but we've got to diversify because this browser is more important than one contract

44:17.160 --> 44:20.640
with one company and we've got to implement these ads to come up with a new source of

44:20.640 --> 44:21.640
revenue.

44:21.640 --> 44:26.800
If they had just been totally straight, plain English like that, do you think things would

44:26.800 --> 44:28.700
have gone over better?

44:28.700 --> 44:32.200
I think it would have helped, but I mean, you're always going to have people who would

44:32.200 --> 44:36.380
rather see your project go down in flames than have you backtrack a little bit from

44:36.380 --> 44:39.800
their ideal and you're always going to deal with that.

44:39.800 --> 44:44.480
There's no way to explain things sufficiently for those people.

44:44.480 --> 44:50.160
But one thing we did do, when we came out with the Amazon lens in 12.10, it just kind

44:50.160 --> 44:55.760
of landed out of the blue with no explanation of why it was there or what it does and we're

44:55.760 --> 44:58.920
still dealing with that even today.

44:58.920 --> 45:05.280
But then the next release, we came out with the broader SmartScope service and we came

45:05.280 --> 45:08.820
out first with a public spec on our Wiki.

45:08.820 --> 45:14.620
We held multiple Google Hangouts that were recorded explaining what the feature was going

45:14.620 --> 45:16.920
to be and what it was going to do and how it's going to work.

45:16.920 --> 45:17.920
And the security improvements.

45:17.920 --> 45:20.400
Yeah, and the security improvements.

45:20.400 --> 45:22.280
And that certainly helped.

45:22.280 --> 45:28.760
I mean, if you can get the narrative right from the start, that helps.

45:28.760 --> 45:33.640
As soon as the FUD comes in and establishes itself, you're going to spend all of your

45:33.640 --> 45:36.400
time just trying to fight that.

45:36.400 --> 45:37.400
Yeah, great point.

45:37.400 --> 45:43.640
Boy, that is a really well-taken point and I wish there was a way to sort of reinforce

45:43.640 --> 45:46.880
this with the open source community because I'll give you another recent example I talked

45:46.880 --> 45:51.200
about on Coda Radio yesterday.

45:51.200 --> 45:53.680
I want to say for the show, although he's never come on, I'd love to have him join us,

45:53.680 --> 45:59.560
but Martin, who is responsible for the Kaywin project, he continues to battle this problem.

45:59.560 --> 46:03.480
We talked about it several weeks ago here on the show where the media grabs a headline

46:03.480 --> 46:06.560
from the KDE mailing list and just runs with it.

46:06.560 --> 46:14.960
First, we inaccurately reported that the KDE Next release date, but more recently, because

46:14.960 --> 46:19.240
of my lessons learned, I did not run it in last, thankfully, but more recently, Ferronix

46:19.240 --> 46:25.040
ran a story that the KDE search system was a waste of money and that it's being abandoned

46:25.040 --> 46:29.920
in favor of something completely else, which is inaccurate in total and of course not everything's

46:29.920 --> 46:34.120
being abandoned and of course recode is going to be repurposed, but again, they're fighting

46:34.120 --> 46:38.280
a battle that you just touched on, Michael, where they're responding to a narrative that

46:38.280 --> 46:40.080
somebody else created for them.

46:40.080 --> 46:44.480
This is happening more and more for open source projects because, and this goes back to something

46:44.480 --> 46:48.600
else I've been really getting on recently, the coverage in Linux and the open source

46:48.600 --> 46:50.320
space is going downhill.

46:50.320 --> 46:58.040
It's becoming industrialized and it's becoming, it's not original reporting, it's reposting

46:58.040 --> 47:03.360
based on what a corporation wants you to post and it's getting worse and there's agendas

47:03.360 --> 47:07.600
involved and it's getting to the point where not all of the information is coming out and

47:07.600 --> 47:11.100
the press is not giving the actual narrative a chance to get aired out.

47:11.100 --> 47:14.880
The only narratives that are getting repeated by the media are the ones that get created

47:14.880 --> 47:15.880
first.

47:15.880 --> 47:19.880
This is a massive problem that is plaguing Linux and open source and it affects the way

47:19.880 --> 47:23.440
the entire open source community perceives events, I believe.

47:23.440 --> 47:27.080
I think it's one of the things that I want to set out to help correct on our platforms

47:27.080 --> 47:32.120
any shows that we have is that I want to try to give the actual real narrative a chance

47:32.120 --> 47:35.520
to get some airtime because nobody else seems to be doing it.

47:35.520 --> 47:38.720
That's why I wanted to bring you on, Michael, because I really appreciate the fact that

47:38.720 --> 47:43.400
you're, even if, there are some things I could disagree with on your post here.

47:43.400 --> 47:46.400
You've actually generated a very active discussion on our subreddit.

47:46.400 --> 47:51.800
People are taking issue with minimizing the CLA and things like that, but I want to save

47:51.800 --> 47:53.720
the CLA discussion for a future episode.

47:53.720 --> 47:58.760
I'll just say, I want to thank you for bringing this topic out to a broader discussion because

47:58.760 --> 48:05.600
I think the problem really has to be solved with the actual consumers of these open source

48:05.600 --> 48:06.600
projects.

48:06.600 --> 48:12.320
It is our responsibility to consider the long-term viability of these projects.

48:12.320 --> 48:18.080
I extend that to our own projects and our advertisers and why we have ad-supported media

48:18.080 --> 48:19.720
because that makes it sustainable.

48:19.720 --> 48:24.160
I think we have to consider the software we consider valuable, and when they make changes,

48:24.160 --> 48:26.960
we have to understand that sometimes they're doing it for their best interest, in the case

48:26.960 --> 48:32.480
of the Mozilla project, and perhaps even in the case of the Dash Lens results.

48:32.480 --> 48:36.420
I think in that context, your post, while I think there's plenty of things people could

48:36.420 --> 48:38.840
quibble with, it definitely provokes some interesting thoughts.

48:38.840 --> 48:40.640
Thank you for coming on Linux Unplugged today.

48:40.640 --> 48:42.960
Is there anything else you want to touch on before we wrap up?

48:42.960 --> 48:47.440
No, I think that's it, as long as we stay away from the CLA topic, I'm happy.

48:47.440 --> 48:48.440
Okay, all right.

48:48.440 --> 48:49.440
We'll stay away.

48:49.440 --> 48:50.440
We'll stay.

48:50.440 --> 48:51.440
We'll stay.

48:51.440 --> 48:54.560
I've been planning to save that for a future show, so what I'll do is I'll toss you up

48:54.560 --> 48:57.360
into the main mumble room here.

48:57.360 --> 49:01.280
Now, anybody in the mumble room, go ahead and let me know if you had anything you wanted

49:01.280 --> 49:05.160
to touch on this, but I wanted to zoom out as we kind of wrap up here, guys, before we

49:05.160 --> 49:09.000
get to the hard drive recovery thing that I want to get to before the show ends.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.240
What do you guys think?

49:10.240 --> 49:13.240
Looking at this, you've probably all witnessed these kinds of things where the community

49:13.240 --> 49:19.280
gets really upset about something that sort of is necessary, and I'm willing to say the

49:19.280 --> 49:24.800
perhaps I've been too critical of the Unity Dash results, especially now with the security

49:24.800 --> 49:26.280
improvements that have been made.

49:26.280 --> 49:29.280
You got to make something sustainable.

49:29.280 --> 49:30.280
What do you guys think?

49:30.280 --> 49:35.800
Chris, I want to take something actually Matt said and take it one step further when he

49:35.800 --> 49:39.860
was comparing Apple with open source companies specifically on this topic, and that's Apple

49:39.860 --> 49:41.440
stands as like an authority.

49:41.440 --> 49:43.360
They make decisions, and we don't have a choice in them.

49:43.360 --> 49:44.920
They're kind of like our parents in a way.

49:44.920 --> 49:49.200
There's nothing we can do, whereas open source companies, we've helped them grow.

49:49.200 --> 49:53.840
We've helped nourish them over the years, so for us, they're more like friends.

49:53.840 --> 49:58.880
We feel personally attached to these companies because we've been there from when Firefox

49:58.880 --> 50:04.360
started till now, and in a way, because we've been there for that long and we've been there

50:04.360 --> 50:08.560
to support them and nourish them, we feel like we have a personal stake not only in

50:08.560 --> 50:12.920
their successes but also in their failures, and when they do make missteps, I think we

50:12.920 --> 50:19.080
kind of take it a little more personally because we want to be the open source banner of what's

50:19.080 --> 50:23.760
right, and when we see that, we see that as our community as a whole faltering, not just

50:23.760 --> 50:24.760
Firefox faltering.

50:24.760 --> 50:30.960
And we invested our time and our energy because their ideals aligned with our ideals, right?

50:30.960 --> 50:35.440
And so when those ideals deviate from our ideals, we feel a little bit robbed because

50:35.440 --> 50:37.000
that wasn't the original bargain.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.360
Is that what you're saying?

50:38.360 --> 50:40.360
Is that what you're saying?

50:40.360 --> 50:41.360
Yeah.

50:41.360 --> 50:44.440
So go ahead, Crossroads, because you said it was bad enough when it was just Amazon.

50:44.440 --> 50:45.440
What did you mean?

50:45.440 --> 50:52.440
No, what I meant was that it was bad when it was only Amazon because when it's only

50:52.440 --> 50:58.800
Amazon, then it appears as ads in 1310 once they had smart scopes and it covered plenty

50:58.800 --> 50:59.800
of sources.

50:59.800 --> 51:00.800
At that point, it became okay.

51:00.800 --> 51:01.800
Gotcha.

51:01.800 --> 51:02.800
Go ahead, Riley.

51:02.800 --> 51:06.880
I think the thing is just ads itself.

51:06.880 --> 51:10.320
Ads are never a cool thing, no matter what it is.

51:10.320 --> 51:14.880
I don't care who you are, if you say you're going to introduce ads, there's always going

51:14.880 --> 51:20.880
to be people who say no and scream at you.

51:20.880 --> 51:25.000
You can all have the best PR in the world, but if you introduce ads, it's still a bad

51:25.000 --> 51:28.560
thing to a lot of people and there will always be those people who hate you for it.

51:28.560 --> 51:33.560
So you've got to take that with a grain of salt.

51:33.560 --> 51:37.600
You win some and you lose some.

51:37.600 --> 51:39.160
I would take that because I agree with that, actually.

51:39.160 --> 51:40.440
I think that's a spot on statement.

51:40.440 --> 51:44.520
I'd take it even further and say part of what Apple does to make their own efforts successful

51:44.520 --> 51:47.800
too is that they're choosing their battlefield.

51:47.800 --> 51:52.640
So they're picking people that won't be as likely to object as folks that will by going

51:52.640 --> 51:56.920
to the Tube TV versus exclusively going online.

51:56.920 --> 52:01.080
They're working with people that are already comfortable being bombarded with crap and

52:01.080 --> 52:03.280
aren't going to react as poorly.

52:03.280 --> 52:05.600
Well, I mean, so Ick, what do you think?

52:05.600 --> 52:09.080
You say maybe it's a necessary evil to have these ads.

52:09.080 --> 52:10.080
Absolutely.

52:10.080 --> 52:15.760
And the reason is, is because people have to be able to make some sort of income.

52:15.760 --> 52:20.240
It doesn't matter if you are, you know, I've dealt with nonprofits for a good chunk of

52:20.240 --> 52:27.000
time myself in my professional career and they have to have some income somehow.

52:27.000 --> 52:32.720
The thing is now there is a line that can be drawn at Lampy2 in the chat room did mention

52:32.720 --> 52:33.720
it.

52:33.720 --> 52:35.140
Just don't track me.

52:35.140 --> 52:38.640
It's when you start getting followed around the internet and you're browsing.

52:38.640 --> 52:41.840
Yeah, that's exactly a line of privacy being crossed.

52:41.840 --> 52:45.520
Daredevil, do you think there's an alternative to ads?

52:45.520 --> 52:52.120
Yes, I think there's many models that that can work and then can be put into test.

52:52.120 --> 52:59.080
Ads has been the model that is mostly used because it reduces costs and you can actually

52:59.080 --> 53:02.580
sell even if you're selling something, you can sell it at a lower rate and expect to

53:02.580 --> 53:04.600
gain those profits later.

53:04.600 --> 53:08.920
But I don't think it's the only model and people should try to look a little bit also

53:08.920 --> 53:14.440
and risk on models, business models, not only on development models, but business models

53:14.440 --> 53:15.440
as well.

53:15.440 --> 53:21.280
I kind of want to dovetail on that a little bit because we're still within that topic.

53:21.280 --> 53:27.080
When I was looking at what Firefox is doing, you know, they're getting most of their income

53:27.080 --> 53:28.080
from Google.

53:28.080 --> 53:31.600
Well, what if Google decides to pull out on that agreement?

53:31.600 --> 53:35.100
Then they have to come up with their revenue some other way.

53:35.100 --> 53:40.360
And you know, the thing is, they're only getting one percent, actually less than one percent

53:40.360 --> 53:42.600
of their revenue from donations.

53:42.600 --> 53:46.760
So that becomes a problem when you're not going to be making as much money to be all

53:46.760 --> 53:49.520
your developers.

53:49.520 --> 53:58.280
I think Mozilla is going to have hate thrown at them either way.

53:58.280 --> 54:06.320
So really like Apple's done is they actually just make the product, throw it out there,

54:06.320 --> 54:09.560
see how it sells and just go with that.

54:09.560 --> 54:12.200
Like no way.

54:12.200 --> 54:17.120
So Daredevil and I know, you know, so I'll tell you, you think maybe donations aren't

54:17.120 --> 54:19.160
the model, but God, don't we all want them to be?

54:19.160 --> 54:22.760
Don't you want the people who are consuming the thing to be the people who finance the

54:22.760 --> 54:23.760
thing?

54:23.760 --> 54:24.760
What are your thoughts?

54:24.760 --> 54:25.760
Yes.

54:25.760 --> 54:34.160
I agree exactly that and actually, for example, I quite appreciated when Ubuntu had this button

54:34.160 --> 54:39.240
that when you were to download, you could actually vote with your wallet where the money

54:39.240 --> 54:40.240
goes to.

54:40.240 --> 54:41.240
Yeah.

54:41.240 --> 54:42.760
And I think that's actually much better.

54:42.760 --> 54:50.300
And let's say you make three months or just a limited time where people get this.

54:50.300 --> 54:54.760
They can get the source code as well while they download and they get the paid version.

54:54.760 --> 54:56.480
They just pay for the product.

54:56.480 --> 54:57.480
It's a license.

54:57.480 --> 55:00.800
And then after that time, it actually gets released for everyone.

55:00.800 --> 55:02.280
That's another model, for instance.

55:02.280 --> 55:05.640
Now, Mr. Hall, I know you had a response to Art of Music's point.

55:05.640 --> 55:06.640
Go ahead.

55:06.640 --> 55:07.640
Go ahead.

55:07.640 --> 55:09.680
Can you hear me now?

55:09.680 --> 55:10.680
Okay.

55:10.680 --> 55:14.240
So you mentioned that, you know, the Apple approach is to just throw something over the

55:14.240 --> 55:17.060
wall and be done with it that way.

55:17.060 --> 55:21.400
And I think part of what I wanted to stress in my blog post was that if we keep going

55:21.400 --> 55:26.960
after the companies that are doing mostly right so harshly, we're going to drive more

55:26.960 --> 55:30.900
people in the opposite direction, that we're going to drive them to the Apple approach

55:30.900 --> 55:35.000
where they just throw it out there and say, here it is, use it or don't.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
Good point.

55:36.000 --> 55:41.680
Now, Riley, I wanted to shift gears to you because I know you had an idea about a Mozilla

55:41.680 --> 55:42.680
service.

55:42.680 --> 55:43.680
Tell me about this.

55:43.680 --> 55:44.680
Yes.

55:44.680 --> 55:49.880
How about instead of maybe ads, how about you start offering some like streaming services

55:49.880 --> 55:55.240
or cloud storage services, like things like that, you can join revenue from like subscription

55:55.240 --> 55:56.720
big type things maybe.

55:56.720 --> 55:58.000
For the sync or something.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.120
Well, I'd say privacy services would probably be the most logical course.

56:01.120 --> 56:02.120
Yeah.

56:02.120 --> 56:03.120
Exactly.

56:03.120 --> 56:04.120
I mean, VPN service.

56:04.120 --> 56:05.120
That would be excellent.

56:05.120 --> 56:06.120
Yeah.

56:06.120 --> 56:07.120
I can see that.

56:07.120 --> 56:08.120
People have a trust there.

56:08.120 --> 56:09.120
I don't know.

56:09.120 --> 56:10.120
I think I kind of fall down with you, Crash Benedict.

56:10.120 --> 56:14.320
Crash Benedict, you say, hey, Opera, Safari, these guys have been doing this since day

56:14.320 --> 56:15.320
one.

56:15.320 --> 56:16.800
But how successful are they?

56:16.800 --> 56:21.800
The actual proposal that they made was that on a brand new install of Firefox, you know,

56:21.800 --> 56:25.120
you get the new tab page with the nine squares on it.

56:25.120 --> 56:32.920
All they're going to be doing is giving companies the ability to be put on that before the user

56:32.920 --> 56:35.040
has actually filled that up with their own thing.

56:35.040 --> 56:39.120
So until you've visited your first nine websites on a brand new install, you're going to see

56:39.120 --> 56:40.120
those defaults.

56:40.120 --> 56:41.120
Right.

56:41.120 --> 56:44.120
But then eventually, you would even replace them with your own sites that you frequent.

56:44.120 --> 56:45.120
Exactly.

56:45.120 --> 56:48.520
And, I mean, I recall installing Opera way back when.

56:48.520 --> 56:51.620
This was like five, six, seven, eight years ago.

56:51.620 --> 56:55.440
And they had, you know, the page with all the different tiles on it.

56:55.440 --> 56:59.560
And when you installed it, you'd open it and they'd have links on that to Facebook and

56:59.560 --> 57:02.080
Google and YouTube and whatever, Wikipedia and stuff like that.

57:02.080 --> 57:05.840
It was just some default sites that they suggest to you.

57:05.840 --> 57:08.680
And the mobile Firefox does the same thing.

57:08.680 --> 57:11.720
When you open it for the first time, it has some default things.

57:11.720 --> 57:13.600
See, this goes to Michael's point.

57:13.600 --> 57:20.120
I think if Firefox, I mean, tell me if I'm wrong here, Michael, but if Firefox had shipped

57:20.120 --> 57:24.320
the browser from day one when they invented this new tabs page, the first time it went

57:24.320 --> 57:29.600
out, if they just signed up agreements and populated it, no one would give a crap.

57:29.600 --> 57:30.600
That's it.

57:30.600 --> 57:31.600
Right?

57:31.600 --> 57:32.600
Nobody would care.

57:32.600 --> 57:35.180
It would not even be a topic of discussion.

57:35.180 --> 57:39.320
But because they're changing the deal after we've already all made the deal, after we've

57:39.320 --> 57:43.320
all done some sort of imaginary handshake, now it's a big deal.

57:43.320 --> 57:44.360
Now we're all upset.

57:44.360 --> 57:45.600
Now we're all butthurt.

57:45.600 --> 57:50.400
Instead, we'd rather they have some sort of deal with Google, but God forbid they make

57:50.400 --> 57:52.720
money directly.

57:52.720 --> 57:54.640
I prefer that, to be honest with you.

57:54.640 --> 57:57.580
I prefer that they're not attached to Google at the hip.

57:57.580 --> 58:01.400
Maybe someday we'll see DuckDuckGo as the default search if they're not getting $300

58:01.400 --> 58:04.120
million a year from Google.

58:04.120 --> 58:06.120
Maybe DuckDuckGo gets product placement now.

58:06.120 --> 58:08.560
I mean, I think this could be a really good thing.

58:08.560 --> 58:10.040
Oh, I don't know.

58:10.040 --> 58:13.520
Hey, why don't we solve Joey's hard drive problem before we get out of here?

58:13.520 --> 58:19.920
He writes and he says, all right, he says, to start, I'm a complete newbie to using Linux.

58:19.920 --> 58:24.040
I'm a 50-year-old systems analyst who has worked in Windows World for a long time.

58:24.040 --> 58:28.160
A year or so ago, I got hooked on the Linux action show, so I decided to try Linux.

58:28.160 --> 58:34.240
I've got a couple of Dell D3 630s, one with KDE and the other partitioned with Maya and

58:34.240 --> 58:35.360
Ubuntu.

58:35.360 --> 58:38.900
So far, my experience has been absolutely positive, and I kick myself for not trying

58:38.900 --> 58:40.600
Linux sooner.

58:40.600 --> 58:44.720
So I have a ton of questions, but the most pressing is regarding an issue I ran into

58:44.720 --> 58:47.920
a couple of months ago while updating Ubuntu.

58:47.920 --> 58:53.400
I mentioned earlier that I have Ubuntu and a Mint slash Maya on this machine.

58:53.400 --> 58:58.500
During the update, the hard drive crashed, and now I'm getting bad sector messages when

58:58.500 --> 59:00.320
I try to boot up Ubuntu.

59:00.320 --> 59:04.560
I can still boot up my Mint with no problem, and I'd like to see if any of my data on the

59:04.560 --> 59:06.880
Ubuntu partition is retrievable.

59:06.880 --> 59:11.600
I realize this is a hardware issue related, it's related to a hardware issue, and it's

59:11.600 --> 59:14.320
not changed my mind about learning about Linux at all.

59:14.320 --> 59:19.760
However, I can't seem to find a way to access the partition from the Mint partition.

59:19.760 --> 59:21.840
If it's not possible, then so be it.

59:21.840 --> 59:26.040
I sincerely apologize for my lack of knowledge, and if I've used any incorrect terminology.

59:26.040 --> 59:27.940
I hope that you have not known my lengthy message.

59:27.940 --> 59:30.320
Your assistance and advice is most appreciated."

59:30.320 --> 59:37.240
So, boy, I read that last paragraph and I get a little worried.

59:37.240 --> 59:42.160
Yeah, I mean, first and foremost, I mean, when in doubt, do hard drive, obviously.

59:42.160 --> 59:46.080
I guess outside of that, maybe a file system check of some, you know, I mean, I don't know.

59:46.080 --> 59:47.080
Yeah, Riley's got us.

59:47.080 --> 59:48.080
Riley, what do you think?

59:48.080 --> 59:50.200
I think you're going to recommend one of my favorite tools, aren't you?

59:50.200 --> 59:51.200
Yes, System Rescue CD.

59:51.200 --> 59:55.680
You actually have a lot of tools where you can check and clean your hard drive out.

59:55.680 --> 59:56.680
There you go.

59:56.680 --> 01:00:01.880
You should be seeing the hard drive and partitions from his Mint installation, and that makes

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.320
me think that it's really, real bad.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.320
It's real bad.

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:09.640
Yeah, if it's that, then there's not much you can do, unfortunately, but it's just a

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.800
couple bad sectors, and System Rescue can help with that.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:13.800
Yeah.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:14.800
Yeah, for sure.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:20.720
It sounds to me like he may have lost his root file system, what have you, on the hard

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:21.720
drive.

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:22.720
You know how it's set up.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.720
Yeah.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.280
So, it's beyond file system check at that point.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.280
It sounds bad.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:30.480
So, what he needs to do is, he needs to get a list of the drives attached and their partitions,

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.520
and the other thing he could try doing is he could try installing, I would recommend,

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:38.360
we did an episode on this, it doesn't quite show in the window, but it's called DD Rescue,

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:42.960
and we did an episode of Linux Action Show on this a while back, so you can find that

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:48.680
if you dig around, but DD Rescue, it's a data recovery tool, and what's great about DD Rescue

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:51.620
is that it will perform like a soldier.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:57.120
It will read and read and read and read that bad sector for as long as it possibly can,

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.580
every single block, man, and it will read and read and read it, and the way it does

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:03.920
it is it will take a pass at your hard drive, and it will get everything it got on that

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.320
first pass, and then it will go back and get the next pass, and then the next pass, and

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:10.160
the next pass, and it will keep going and keep going and keep going for as long as you

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.160
really want it to.

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:14.440
I mean, it will go for a really long time, and it can spit that out to an image file

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:18.960
that you can then look at later on, so that might be something you want to look into,

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:22.480
and there you go, the random person in the chat room just linked the video, I'll put

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.600
a link to that in the chat room, or I mean, I'm sorry, in the show notes, yeah.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:30.480
One suggestion I have, and it might sound a little bit extreme, but it's worked for

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:38.660
me is when I had a 500 gig drive that wasn't readable at all in BIOS or in the system,

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:44.960
so I threw some Googling on, and I ended up putting in a Ziploc bag and putting it in

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:52.240
the freezer for a couple of days, and then it actually read it for a limited time before

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:57.720
it heated up to normal operating temperature, so I could at least pull some files I needed

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:58.720
off.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.720
It's not 100% full-proof, though.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:05.680
That sounds like a last-ditch effort, yeah, that should be a last-ditch effort, if ever.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:10.040
Yeah, that was pretty much my last-ditch effort, since it was a power search that happened

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.040
on my drive.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.480
So, hold on, I'm going to play this clip.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.920
Let me see here, you're seeing timeout errors on SDA, whatever, you're getting error messages

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:17.920
on there.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:18.920
There's some red flags that are being thrown up at you.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.640
Maybe, like, when you mount the drive, your system kind of locks up for a little bit.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.360
These are all indications that drive is going out, you need to get the data off there real

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.360
quick.

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.840
That's where an open source program called DD Rescue comes in.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:33.400
Now, here's what's great about DD Rescue, you're familiar with DD, I would assume, right?

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:39.240
DD Rescue is DD for data recovery, and I'll link to a walkthrough video, you guys can

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:44.920
see how this process works when you're recovering data on a drive, but think of DD Rescue as

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.620
like this.

01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:50.840
You start it on a drive, and you can assign it some thresholds and some variables, and

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:55.320
what DD Rescue's essential mission is, is it tries to rip through that drive from one

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:59.740
end to the other end as fast as possible, and as it goes, every time it hits a bad sector,

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:03.080
it marks it along the way, and then it just keeps going, and it writes all this to a raw

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.080
image file.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.780
You need to store that raw image file on a different drive, I have the syntax for this

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:11.760
in the show notes, and then, as it finds these errors, once it gets to the end of the drive,

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.880
it then loops back, and depending on how many times you've told it in the command line flag,

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:19.800
it then once again tries to get those bad sectors, and it'll try, so say you set it

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.240
for three times, it'll try, it'll go through, it'll go through all of them again, and it's

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:24.240
...

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.240
I used to play old clips of us all the time.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.120
I mean, that was exactly what I just said.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:31.720
So that was a Linux action show season 27, episode 10, if you want to check that out.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:33.960
Sorry, Mom, if you couldn't hear that, I was playing it on your channel, but Joey, good

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:38.240
luck with that, and so check out that episode, we'll have it linked in the show notes.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:41.400
We've got a couple other tools in there, and I think I totally agree with Riley, too.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:45.320
The System Rescue CD has got to be one of the greatest little pieces of... I always

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.600
have a copy in my bag.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:49.360
Whenever I was going to a client, always had a copy of it.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.360
So very cool.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:51.360
Good stuff.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.240
All right, well, I want to say thank you to Michael for coming on Linux Unplugged today.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.520
It was great having you here.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.520
And thanks for having me.

01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.520
Yeah, thanks.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.520
That was awesome.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.520
Yeah, thank you very much, and you are welcome to come back and join our Mumber Room anytime.

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:05.760
We always have it open during Linux Unplugged, so if there's anything on your mind you ever

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.320
want to share, we'll give you a little slot.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:10.720
You come on the show, we'd be happy to have you, and also, we'd love to have you join

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.720
us live.

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.720
Why don't you come over live?

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.860
Join us at jblive.tv.

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:19.560
We start at 2 p.m. Pacific, and you can also get that in your local time zone over at JupiterBroadcasting.com

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.120
slash calendar, and guess what?

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.240
I really would love to hear your feedback.

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.840
You might have noticed this, but Matt and I, we start every single episode of Linux

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.440
Unplugged with your feedback.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.600
That means we need your feedback.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.600
That's how it works.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.600
It's the math of it.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:35.480
So go over to JupiterBroadcasting.com and click that contact link and send something

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.480
in to us.

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.480
We'd love to hear it.

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.480
Now, Matt?

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.480
Yes?

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.480
We have a surprise.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:43.560
We are scheduled to talk with some of the folks from the Numix project.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:49.740
They are setting out to make the GNOME desktop even more beautiful with a complete theming

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:52.800
package that I've been using for a couple of weeks.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.880
It's really elegant.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.780
It's really amazing, and I want to talk to them about making the Linux desktop look better

01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:00.640
and make it look even just more incredible, and that's what they're working on.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:01.960
So they'll be joining us on Sunday.

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:02.960
Right on.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.600
But, you know, that doesn't mean we're not going to have a great show next.

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.360
Linux Unplugged, we've got a great show planned for that, too, so don't worry, everybody.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.360
All right, Matt, have a great week.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:11.360
I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:12.360
All right.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:13.360
See you, son.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.360
All right, everyone.

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:15.360
Thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:30.760
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.
