00:00.000 --> 00:10.440
Man, I tell you what, that Windows 10, that Windows 10, I am impressed at how Windows

00:10.440 --> 00:11.640
it still is.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.280
It really is just Windows still.

00:14.280 --> 00:20.320
I tried it recently on that $10,000 Dell laptop and not impressed.

00:20.320 --> 00:27.400
First of all, I am shocked at how badly Windows 10 shits the bed when you have previously

00:27.400 --> 00:33.400
had Linux installed on it, so say you have existing Ubuntu partitions, like just extended

00:33.400 --> 00:36.320
4, nothing even fancy.

00:36.320 --> 00:40.520
And maybe they are GUID instead of MBR, I do not know.

00:40.520 --> 00:44.640
So Windows 10 will see all of the partitions.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.900
You go to click a partition, say you just want to use like the same sizes, the sizes

00:47.900 --> 00:54.120
all work for you, you go to delete the partition, okay, so far so good, you create a new partition,

00:54.120 --> 00:57.720
it automatically says you want it this size, which is the maximum size available, you hit

00:57.720 --> 00:58.720
apply.

00:58.720 --> 00:59.720
Okay, good to go.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.320
It says it is formatting.

01:01.320 --> 01:05.160
Then when you go to click next, you get an error message that says BitLocker is enabled

01:05.160 --> 01:09.200
on this disk, go to control panel and then it tells you where to go in the control panel,

01:09.200 --> 01:12.160
which obviously you cannot do because you are in setup, the only thing you can do is

01:12.160 --> 01:16.960
do control F10 and bring up the emergency console, you cannot go to the BitLocker control

01:16.960 --> 01:23.180
panel and turn off BitLocker for that drive with the instructions, so it is unbelievable

01:23.180 --> 01:28.920
that this company in their latest version has an error message in their installer that

01:28.920 --> 01:34.080
comes up, which is completely wrong, the drive has totally been reformatted with NTFS, it

01:34.080 --> 01:38.320
does not have BitLocker turned on, so but then the error message comes up and it tells

01:38.320 --> 01:42.080
you all these steps to go to the control panel, which do not exist and what you really have

01:42.080 --> 01:46.760
to do is you have to bring up the emergency console, you have to use their disk utility

01:46.760 --> 01:51.160
emergency thing, you have to go into the volume and you have to select the partition and then

01:51.160 --> 01:55.760
you have to reformat it again from the command line and you cannot reboot in between, if

01:55.760 --> 01:58.800
you see what I did is the first time I did that I made the mistake and then I rebooted

01:58.800 --> 02:02.440
just to make sure everything was good and clean and went back in the installer, same

02:02.440 --> 02:05.960
exact problem, threw me for a loop, I am like oh shit that did not fix it, I thought for

02:05.960 --> 02:09.040
sure that would have fixed it, no, no, no, no, no, what you got to do is you got to delete

02:09.040 --> 02:12.460
it again in the installer, then you got to go to the emergency console, then you got

02:12.460 --> 02:15.640
to run the disk utility, go in there, you got to reformat it again, close the emergency

02:15.640 --> 02:18.440
console and then go back in the installer and finish the installation.

02:18.440 --> 02:23.160
Well that is probably what happens when less than 1% of your users use your drive encryption

02:23.160 --> 02:25.960
technology.

02:25.960 --> 02:30.160
And even I do not think they totally test for installing on a system after Ubuntu, but

02:30.160 --> 02:31.960
what I was surprised by was how little.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.360
No Chris, I hear that Microsoft loves Linux.

02:34.360 --> 02:37.320
I was surprised, first of all when you search for that error message you get very little

02:37.320 --> 02:42.080
information, I was surprised by that, thank you Mr. Beard for stepping in.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.160
I hear Mr. West is here.

02:44.160 --> 02:46.260
Yeah I hear that too, I hear that rumor.

02:46.260 --> 02:49.760
He's a jerk, he's kicking me off the air.

02:49.760 --> 02:50.760
Yeah you know him.

02:50.760 --> 02:51.760
I would never.

02:51.760 --> 02:52.760
Hello Wes.

02:52.760 --> 02:53.760
Hello.

02:53.760 --> 02:56.560
I missed you, it's good to see you.

02:56.560 --> 03:01.520
So that was my Windows 10, I mean it's like just that whole thing, it's just such garbage,

03:01.520 --> 03:03.520
crazy garbage, crazy, crazy garbage.

03:03.520 --> 03:04.760
What are you doing with Windows?

03:04.760 --> 03:09.760
Oh well I got, I stole this laptop from Dell and I wanted to try out Premiere on it, just

03:09.760 --> 03:17.480
to compare it against Lightworks 14 and that sounds reasonable, and was just blown away

03:17.480 --> 03:21.920
by the amazing problems that you still have with Microsoft and this is a fully like anniversary

03:21.920 --> 03:25.680
update or creator's update or whatever they call it, whatever stupid name they have for

03:25.680 --> 03:26.680
it.

03:26.680 --> 03:29.600
It's all fully like the latest ISO, yeah latest, all that and it still does all this

03:29.600 --> 03:31.880
stupid shenanigans.

03:31.880 --> 03:48.560
This is Linux Unplugged episode 193 for April 18th, 2017.

03:48.560 --> 03:52.520
Welcome to Linux Unplugged and yes the band is back together this week, we've got a great

03:52.520 --> 03:54.680
show and my name is Chris.

03:54.680 --> 03:55.680
My name is Wes.

03:55.680 --> 03:59.880
Hello Wes, very excited about some of the things, we have like a new segment, a new

03:59.880 --> 04:06.160
segment, that's one of the things, yes and we also have a very interesting introspective

04:06.160 --> 04:11.160
look at Ubuntu 17.04 if I don't say so myself, but there's something in there that nobody's

04:11.160 --> 04:15.400
really covered yet, it's kind of a shame, so we're going to talk about that, Wes and

04:15.400 --> 04:18.880
I have been kicking the tires, we have some interesting hardware news to discuss in a

04:18.880 --> 04:23.200
little bit and we're going to go through a bunch of our favorite open source project

04:23.200 --> 04:27.720
updates, maybe add a couple of new ones to the map as well, yeah we'll tell you about

04:27.720 --> 04:32.480
those coming up, coming up in a little bit, it's good to be back Wes, Wes, it is great

04:32.480 --> 04:36.520
that you're back, you did, you did a fantastic job, now I feel like I should just be, I can

04:36.520 --> 04:38.920
go all the time, well there you go, I feel like I can leave all the time, I think it's

04:38.920 --> 04:41.480
in the network's interest for you to adventure, how did it go for you, how did it go, it was

04:41.480 --> 04:43.920
good, it was a lot of fun, yeah.

04:43.920 --> 04:47.760
I heard there was a bit of a mixer situation where something was going on, you had to unmute

04:47.760 --> 04:52.280
all the channels, yeah something crazy happened, so you know what I'm going to do, I was thinking

04:52.280 --> 04:56.400
about this, because I know that, that software mixer, that's like the worst thing about it,

04:56.400 --> 05:00.320
it is right, absolutely, for me I use it every day, so like it's no problem, I'm learning,

05:00.320 --> 05:04.160
I'm getting better, I'm getting better, but yeah, no don't worry, don't worry, I have,

05:04.160 --> 05:09.960
I have good news, oh, I think probably before the next time I'm gone, we'll have a big old

05:09.960 --> 05:15.720
huge Linux powered console right here, good old, that would be awesome, yeah physical

05:15.720 --> 05:20.120
switches and dials and all that, so you can look at it and you'll know what's going on,

05:20.120 --> 05:23.880
I can press buttons, yeah, I think it's going to be, I think it's going to be real good,

05:23.880 --> 05:28.240
so yeah, that'll be nice right, yeah, it'll be a good upgrade, so look forward to that,

05:28.240 --> 05:31.720
alright well, before we go any further, what we really got to do is take care of a little

05:31.720 --> 05:36.640
business, we got to bring in our virtual, time appropriate greetings mummer room, greetings

05:36.640 --> 05:44.880
brothers, hello, hello, hello, have you missed them Chris, I did, I did, you know, I wish

05:44.880 --> 05:48.800
I could have joined in the mummer room, because that's always fun, yeah, but it turns out,

05:48.800 --> 05:52.240
you never know what kind of reception you're going to get, that's right, you never know,

05:52.240 --> 05:57.920
speaking of reception, the reception to the announcement that Canonical is discontinuing

05:57.920 --> 06:01.920
their efforts on Unity and switching to GNOME, go figure that happens when I'm gone, right,

06:01.920 --> 06:05.480
what the, damn it Mark, like right after you left, damn it Mark, you know, I thought, I

06:05.480 --> 06:10.240
thought we were buddies, I thought you and I were buddies, kind of ironic, I don't know

06:10.240 --> 06:16.920
if Noah got to share this tidbit, he must have, but I got the news on my phone, I got

06:16.920 --> 06:21.840
a push notification to my phone, as I'm sitting with the Project Sputnik team, who of course

06:21.840 --> 06:25.840
are basing these products around the Unity desktop, and so I had to break the news to

06:25.840 --> 06:31.960
that team, wow, that's kind of a bummer, yeah, and it was like, well it was just a very interesting

06:31.960 --> 06:36.080
position to be in, like, because I got to watch them go, oh shit, well I guess we're

06:36.080 --> 06:40.000
going to be, see the wheels turning, we're going to be responding to that, yeah, so that

06:40.000 --> 06:45.040
was interesting, and so that's going to sort of flavour our discussion a little bit later,

06:45.040 --> 06:49.360
coming up on 1704, yeah, but I want to talk about something kind of from like a project

06:49.360 --> 06:52.960
standpoint that is inevitable, and of course this is going to happen, there's a lot of

06:52.960 --> 06:58.320
different takes on this, a lot of different forks of like the mobile aspect, the guy behind

06:58.320 --> 07:02.960
Ubiport is keeping that going, there's also folks that are going to try to create their

07:02.960 --> 07:07.320
own version of the Unity desktop, and the one that grabbed my attention this week, and

07:07.320 --> 07:11.520
you guys may have heard about it, is the, I'm going to say enjade, yeah, I think so,

07:11.520 --> 07:17.880
desktop, yeah, and so right now it's early days, but they call it a modern unified desktop

07:17.880 --> 07:22.960
environment, what it really is, is Plasma that's been sort of mixed up to look a lot

07:22.960 --> 07:27.060
more like Unity with a few other things, the way they describe it is a community project

07:27.060 --> 07:31.280
to recreate and continue the Unity desktop environment, from the versatile dash down

07:31.280 --> 07:37.520
to the global menu, enjade promises to provide a familiar experience that Ubuntu users love,

07:37.520 --> 07:41.760
while adding new features to keep it up with the latest trends, I don't know what that

07:41.760 --> 07:45.560
means, but I think that sounds good, it does sound good, the entire desktop created from

07:45.560 --> 07:53.600
Plasma, compatibility with Wayland, distribution through Snappy and Flatpacks, hey, and it's

07:53.600 --> 07:58.520
going to have a search function, okay, you know what, I'm good on the search stuff, I'm

07:58.520 --> 08:03.800
good on that, let's put our efforts into other things, because we just, it always, like the

08:03.800 --> 08:09.040
indexer always manages to go crazy, it always, anyways, right, people are sort of downplaying

08:09.040 --> 08:12.560
this one, but something about this one to me, feels like they've got some real momentum

08:12.560 --> 08:17.440
behind it, first of all I think the idea is kind of solid, some of us were looking forward

08:17.440 --> 08:23.500
to a QT Unity 8, kind of seemed like a good idea, and I've been a big fan of the Plasma

08:23.500 --> 08:29.400
desktop recently, running on half my machines right now, and it's very possible to make

08:29.400 --> 08:33.980
the Plasma desktop a lot like Unity, there's just a few things missing, yeah, totally,

08:33.980 --> 08:38.340
and the Plasma desktop is very extensible, configurable, so it seems like a natural platform

08:38.340 --> 08:42.800
to try to build that on, yeah, yeah, we'll watch and see where it goes, there's a few

08:42.800 --> 08:45.720
other projects out there, including ones that are just like themes that can be applied and

08:45.720 --> 08:48.840
styles that can be applied to the Plasma desktop, so clearly there's a lot of interest, or at

08:48.840 --> 08:52.200
least right now, yeah, and we're going to talk a little bit more about it later on in

08:52.200 --> 08:55.680
the show, but I just wanted to talk about that, and then on the other end, so if you're

08:55.680 --> 09:01.200
a GTK desktop fan and you're not going anywhere, but you did like a few things from Unity,

09:01.200 --> 09:03.840
a lot of people have said to me, you know, the thing I really liked about Unity was the

09:03.840 --> 09:08.000
HUD, in fact Wimpy, you remember when Wimpy used to come on this show, oh yeah, that Wimpy

09:08.000 --> 09:11.600
back before there was some things going on at Canonical, I suspect, I haven't heard from

09:11.600 --> 09:14.680
them in a while, but back when Wimpy used to come on this show, one of his favorite

09:14.680 --> 09:20.000
things about Unity was the HUD, they've even worked on it for the Mate desktop, so that's

09:20.000 --> 09:23.540
something that I think a lot of people that are coming from Unity and going to the GNOME

09:23.540 --> 09:27.920
desktop might miss, it's kind of a neat feature if you get used to it, and it's sort of unique

09:27.920 --> 09:34.020
to Unity, well there is a GNOME extension that sort of recreates the whole Unity HUD

09:34.020 --> 09:39.480
experience for GTK applications, so if you're familiar with like Sublime Text or Addams

09:39.480 --> 09:45.680
Command Palette that you can fire up, it's a lot like that, you get essentially anything

09:45.680 --> 09:50.760
that the menus can do, you can do from the keyboard, it brings that to every application

09:50.760 --> 09:58.460
that uses GTK 3, it automatically extracts all available commands, and it does that by

09:58.460 --> 10:04.240
also observing what is the running application, it will adapt the UI to match the appropriate

10:04.240 --> 10:09.080
application which sounds really cool, also to relevant actions, and it requires no modifications

10:09.080 --> 10:11.880
to the applications because it's using just the features of GTK.

10:11.880 --> 10:14.200
It looks pretty slick, I might give this a try.

10:14.200 --> 10:20.760
Yeah, it actually looks really cool, and really if you think about it, if HUD is one of the

10:20.760 --> 10:27.880
things you like the most about Unity, but you're trying to get to where the puck is

10:27.880 --> 10:32.240
going to be hit by a Canadian or something, something about Canadians and pucks, if you're

10:32.240 --> 10:36.120
going that direction, this might be something to try.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.120
Absolutely.

10:37.120 --> 10:38.120
Pretty cool.

10:38.120 --> 10:42.520
And we will have that linked in the show notes, because it's up on Github, but it's, how do

10:42.520 --> 10:49.520
you say it, what are you going to say it was, Plotinus, yeah, so it's P-L-O-T-I-N-U-S, Plotinus

10:49.520 --> 10:50.520
perhaps.

10:50.520 --> 10:51.520
Yeah.

10:51.520 --> 10:57.840
It's really nice, and it's an example of ways that you can tweak Gnome.

10:57.840 --> 11:04.400
Ryan and Noah had a conversation about System76 making modifications.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.040
If I were System76, I'd probably be looking at extensions like this.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.040
Yeah, definitely.

11:08.040 --> 11:11.480
And then the market will decide if they like something like that.

11:11.480 --> 11:12.480
Yeah.

11:12.480 --> 11:13.480
Like, wow.

11:13.480 --> 11:17.760
Now's the time we can dissect what we like about Unity, spread that across the other

11:17.760 --> 11:18.960
desktop environments.

11:18.960 --> 11:23.160
In some ways, I wonder if in a few weeks, in a few months, people will be speaking more

11:23.160 --> 11:24.840
positively of Unity.

11:24.840 --> 11:27.140
Because now that they know that there's a light at the end of the tunnel, that this

11:27.140 --> 11:30.920
great travesty that was committed against the Linux community will finally be coming

11:30.920 --> 11:31.920
to an end.

11:31.920 --> 11:35.160
Right, the part they hate, which is just the, you know, not invented here, or fork, or whatever,

11:35.160 --> 11:36.160
that part's done.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.160
Yeah.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.600
So now we can talk about all the great things that Unity did right.

11:39.600 --> 11:43.160
I don't know about that, but maybe it's coming a little bit.

11:43.160 --> 11:47.840
So I'd also, if you're switching over to Gnome for the first time, and you've discovered

11:47.840 --> 11:51.000
a new extension, tweet me at ChrisLAS and let me know what you're trying.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
I'd like to know.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.800
I want to talk a little hardware here for a second.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.520
So I was just talking about the Sputnik team.

11:55.520 --> 12:00.720
This is a blog post by Barton George, and he is announcing something that we got our

12:00.720 --> 12:03.440
hands on while we were at it.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.240
It's their new Precision desktop.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.240
It's an all-in-one.

12:06.240 --> 12:09.120
Now, I'm talking about this for a couple of reasons, because I think this is a super badass

12:09.120 --> 12:10.120
machine.

12:10.120 --> 12:14.040
And this is one of the reasons why I was recently really considering trying to switch to Lightworks.

12:14.040 --> 12:19.640
It's a 27-inch all-in-one, but it's like, this Precision one has a Xeon processor.

12:19.640 --> 12:23.000
You can get it with ECC RAM, you can get it with, I think you can even get it with Ryzen

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
graphics.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Oh, wow.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
27-inch screen.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.840
It's the Dell Precision 5720, but I got to play with it.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.960
I don't know if it's Ryzen or not.

12:31.960 --> 12:35.960
They say the latest AMD Radeon Pro graphics.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.360
Does anybody in the moment know what the hell that means?

12:38.360 --> 12:40.800
Does anybody know what the hell that means?

12:40.800 --> 12:45.760
I don't know if that means Ryzen or not, because it's the latest Pro graphics.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.920
But it's the Precision 5270.

12:48.920 --> 12:52.520
It's a pretty monstrous machine.

12:52.520 --> 12:56.640
The thing that I should be talking about is probably the graphics and that stuff.

12:56.640 --> 13:01.120
I got to impress upon you, the coolest thing about this machine was the soundbar that they've

13:01.120 --> 13:02.120
built into it.

13:02.120 --> 13:03.120
Really?

13:03.120 --> 13:04.120
It's essentially a soundbar.

13:04.120 --> 13:05.120
Okay.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.320
It shouldn't be the speakers, but you guys got to understand how cool these speakers

13:07.320 --> 13:08.320
are.

13:08.320 --> 13:12.280
We had a little demo, and it doesn't convey very well, because we're just listening with

13:12.280 --> 13:13.280
a microphone.

13:13.280 --> 13:18.160
But I'll give you a hint of what it was like as I cut out a part of the demo that we didn't

13:18.160 --> 13:20.360
air because it doesn't really translate very well, but it gives you an idea.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.480
There's this integrated soundbar here, basically.

13:22.480 --> 13:26.800
We actually partnered with a multiple Grammy Award-winning record producer, Jack Joseph

13:26.800 --> 13:30.760
Pewig, to design and tune this audio solution.

13:30.760 --> 13:35.640
It is best-in-class audio solution in a PC, hands down.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.360
It's got these... You can see the six front-firing speakers.

13:38.360 --> 13:43.200
There's two down-firing speakers and two passive radiators, so it's 10 total speakers.

13:43.200 --> 13:47.120
It is the only system that includes both the front-firing and the down-firing speakers.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.080
We're going to do an audio demo.

13:49.080 --> 13:55.360
This is a mix playlist here, so we'll get to experience and hopefully you can hear the

13:55.360 --> 13:56.920
audio come through.

13:56.920 --> 14:02.120
It makes me feel like... It makes me feel like...

14:02.120 --> 14:08.760
Now, remind you, this is right on Noah's directional microphone here.

14:08.760 --> 14:14.320
You kind of get a sense of how loud it is, but what I did is I cut out the audio demo

14:14.320 --> 14:17.560
here because a very funny thing happened.

14:17.560 --> 14:18.560
You got to picture the scene.

14:18.560 --> 14:19.800
We're in a large conference room.

14:19.800 --> 14:23.760
The room, you can kind of tell by the audio, it's a very large room.

14:23.760 --> 14:28.440
You could easily fit 25, 30 people in this room.

14:28.440 --> 14:32.320
Thick walls, thick doors, double-paned glass.

14:32.320 --> 14:40.040
This is like an industrial conference room where people can have hearty conversations.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.640
We kind of disturbed the entire office.

14:42.640 --> 14:43.640
Wow.

14:43.640 --> 14:45.520
I'll cut a little bit here.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.760
Somebody walks in and they're like, you got to turn it down, turn it down.

14:47.760 --> 14:48.880
Then we're like, well, no.

14:48.880 --> 14:49.880
They're doing a demo.

14:49.880 --> 14:50.880
They're filming right now.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.240
No, you've got to turn it down.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.240
You've got to turn it down.

14:53.240 --> 14:57.920
It's so good that we got the teams over here enjoying it.

14:57.920 --> 15:00.880
Now what's funny is I cut in a little bit of the Dell promo for this where they show

15:00.880 --> 15:01.880
the speakers.

15:01.880 --> 15:02.880
That was pretty slick.

15:02.880 --> 15:03.880
Check this out.

15:03.880 --> 15:09.060
In the promotion, they make reference to disturbing the neighbors.

15:09.060 --> 15:13.260
So watch this right here.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.600
Not this part, but that is kind of cool too.

15:15.600 --> 15:20.040
So they show you the diet, how all these speakers are built, but I thought this was right here

15:20.040 --> 15:23.800
so the neighbors can enjoy it too, which was very ironic when I went back and watched this

15:23.800 --> 15:27.440
promotional video because they had to come in because the rooms next to us, it was too

15:27.440 --> 15:29.800
loud for them.

15:29.800 --> 15:32.360
And then what she says after we were done, she says, yeah, that was only like a half

15:32.360 --> 15:33.360
volume.

15:33.360 --> 15:34.360
Wow.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.360
Okay.

15:35.360 --> 15:36.360
So you're legit impressed with this thing.

15:36.360 --> 15:39.720
I was really, I was like, okay, all right, this would be a great machine for editing

15:39.720 --> 15:43.720
because you can get a really great processor in there and get a ton of RAM in there.

15:43.720 --> 15:47.240
See, that's like one of those features where I would be initially skeptical of it.

15:47.240 --> 15:51.520
There'll probably be some standard, I'm going to get other speakers anyway or use headphones,

15:51.520 --> 15:52.520
but that's awesome.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.000
Sounds like a good deal.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.960
What I think is interesting is, so you have this, so what I now understand about Dell

15:59.960 --> 16:02.520
is that I like the dimension and precision lines.

16:02.520 --> 16:05.280
I didn't realize that, but these are like the workstation class stuff.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.480
It's a lot better.

16:06.480 --> 16:10.180
That's when you start getting like the Xeons and you get the high quality build materials

16:10.180 --> 16:11.800
and all this kind of stuff.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.680
So now it all clicks now that I've gone there and seen it.

16:14.680 --> 16:19.360
And the reason why I think this is a big story is, so not only is this obviously a vendor

16:19.360 --> 16:24.520
that has tons of enterprise relationships and school relationships and an incredibly

16:24.520 --> 16:30.640
large brand recognition, but they have transitioned from a company that when they first... When

16:30.640 --> 16:33.140
I bought... Oh, it's in the other room.

16:33.140 --> 16:37.880
When I bought the XPS410 from Dell a decade ago, I bought that computer actually almost

16:37.880 --> 16:39.160
11 years ago from Dell.

16:39.160 --> 16:43.960
It was one of the first what they call client devices they ever tried to sell shipping Linux.

16:43.960 --> 16:49.040
And the whole idea behind it was, how cheap can we sell a computer?

16:49.040 --> 16:54.480
Because if we knock $100 off for Windows, we put a 5400 RPM drive in there, how cheap

16:54.480 --> 16:55.640
can we sell a computer?

16:55.640 --> 16:58.080
And part of making it cheap is putting Linux on it.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.360
That was Dell's approach.

16:59.360 --> 17:02.720
And to me, that was what I was always extremely skeptical.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.960
I even said in my predictions episode for the last, at the beginning of January, I don't

17:05.960 --> 17:10.400
know if Dell's serious about Linux, because that to me was like, you're screwing around

17:10.400 --> 17:11.400
here.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.400
You're not taking it seriously.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.720
I want a nice computer.

17:15.720 --> 17:21.720
So now what we have is we have them shipping the Precision 5720.

17:21.720 --> 17:30.120
We have them shipping that crazy $10,000 laptop that we covered, that monster machine.

17:30.120 --> 17:33.480
I think it's called the Precision 7720.

17:33.480 --> 17:39.920
They have these really nice systems now that they're shipping with Linux that they're not

17:39.920 --> 17:42.840
shipping because they're cheap, they're shipping them because they're high end workstations

17:42.840 --> 17:52.920
with Xeon processors and ECC RAM, and I think it's going to be big for them.

17:52.920 --> 17:57.660
He said just on their developer laptop program, they're seeing a year over year 100% growth.

17:57.660 --> 18:01.260
So in two years, they've seen a 200% growth.

18:01.260 --> 18:02.260
Those are big numbers.

18:02.260 --> 18:03.260
Could be huge.

18:03.260 --> 18:07.000
It would be pretty nice to imagine getting a new job, you get a new laptop, you can get

18:07.000 --> 18:09.800
this supported right from Dell.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.440
Well maybe kick Lenovo in the butt a bit.

18:12.440 --> 18:15.280
Get them off their game, or get them on their game.

18:15.280 --> 18:16.280
Get them off their butt.

18:16.280 --> 18:17.280
Get them off the pod.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.400
Realize there's a market here, or could be.

18:19.400 --> 18:24.160
It'd be really good to get some competition in that area, and then everybody wins.

18:24.160 --> 18:28.280
The more people in the market, the more competition, I think it's better for everybody.

18:28.280 --> 18:29.280
We'll see.

18:29.280 --> 18:31.280
We'll see where it goes.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.400
You know what else there's competition for?

18:33.400 --> 18:34.400
Highly skilled folks.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.720
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and become one of them.

18:37.720 --> 18:42.680
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, support the show and sign up for a free seven day trial.

18:42.680 --> 18:45.000
This is a platform to learn more about Linux.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.320
Now you could be somebody who's worked with Linux for a decade, and you know there's still

18:48.320 --> 18:49.960
little things you can go learn.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.040
That's what I love about the Nuggets.

18:51.040 --> 18:58.280
Even if you're a busy person already with kids or a job, I know how it feels, and sometimes

18:58.280 --> 19:00.520
it's hard to continue your education.

19:00.520 --> 19:02.560
That's why I love their course scheduler and their Nuggets.

19:02.560 --> 19:05.420
These are features I probably talk about the most in these spots because they relate to

19:05.420 --> 19:06.800
me the most.

19:06.800 --> 19:11.640
It's where I continue even after a couple of years now to get value from linuxacademy.com

19:11.640 --> 19:12.640
slash unplugged.

19:12.640 --> 19:17.840
You go there to support the show and you sign up for a free seven day trial.

19:17.840 --> 19:21.200
One of the things that I really realized that Linux Academy was clicking with the community

19:21.200 --> 19:23.960
is when they developed their flashcard feature.

19:23.960 --> 19:28.760
It's simple, but it's perfect for somebody like me who just needs little bits to study

19:28.760 --> 19:34.960
from, but they can get stale after a while.

19:34.960 --> 19:38.920
The Linux Academy flashcard system not only can randomize a set of cards for you to study

19:38.920 --> 19:42.120
from, but they can be forked and improved by the community.

19:42.120 --> 19:47.880
The community is full of Jupyter broadcasting members, so it's like top grade stuff.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.840
They have Nuggets for just little bits of wisdom when you have just a little bit of

19:50.840 --> 19:54.440
time, and they have study tools and lesson audio and personal notebooks that you can

19:54.440 --> 19:58.360
take with you offline, iOS and Android apps to help you study on the go.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.840
They spin up cloud servers on demand that you can SSH into.

20:00.840 --> 20:04.920
They have Learning Paths, which are a series of courses and contents planned for very specific

20:04.920 --> 20:06.840
types of certs or exams.

20:06.840 --> 20:07.840
It's great.

20:07.840 --> 20:13.360
And to top it all off, like the sprinkles on top of a delicious cupcake, they have instructor

20:13.360 --> 20:14.360
mentoring.

20:14.360 --> 20:17.400
And what that means is they have real full time human beings that can help you with the

20:17.400 --> 20:18.400
subject material.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.400
That's huge.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.400
Huge.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.400
Very big.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.800
Also, if you're at DockerCon this week, stop by and say hi to Justin.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.080
He's there from Linux Academy.

20:26.080 --> 20:29.520
He's down there taking notes for the team to see what's coming up.

20:29.520 --> 20:34.240
And I think also, he's going to be at the AWS Summit as well.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.680
I mean, he's got guys all over the place.

20:35.680 --> 20:36.680
Check it out.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.720
Then check out Linux Academy on Twitter as well, LinuxAcademy.com, where they're telling

20:39.720 --> 20:40.960
you about all this kind of stuff.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.720
You can stay apprised if they're at an event you're going to.

20:43.720 --> 20:44.720
Check out their Twitter feed.

20:44.720 --> 20:45.720
You'll probably see about it.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.040
And you can go say hi.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.240
Go check out the booth.

20:48.240 --> 20:49.880
Maybe get a little penguin plush from time.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.000
I hear they have those from time to time.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
What?

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
My kids love them.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.200
Go to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplug to support the show and find them on Twitter, LinuxAcademy.com,

20:59.200 --> 21:03.440
and probably coming to Mastodon sometime soon.

21:03.440 --> 21:04.760
Mastodon reference.

21:04.760 --> 21:05.760
OK.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.680
I wanted to start a new segment in the show.

21:08.680 --> 21:18.680
And I wanted to take projects that have been in a darkness, a silence, perhaps a cone of

21:18.680 --> 21:23.840
silence.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.280
I want to take these out of the cone of silence.

21:26.280 --> 21:27.280
Shine some light.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.280
I don't want to shine some light.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.280
Because I think these are fascinating.

21:29.280 --> 21:33.080
And if anybody in the moment has any experience with any of these, feel free to interrupt

21:33.080 --> 21:35.360
with your set experience.

21:35.360 --> 21:41.000
The first one up, Wes, is Torrent Peak, a new contender for our favorite open source

21:41.000 --> 21:43.600
projects here on the show, Torrent Peak.

21:43.600 --> 21:44.600
Distributed search engines.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.800
Oh, got me there.

21:46.800 --> 21:47.800
Using BitTorrent.

21:47.800 --> 21:48.800
Oh.

21:48.800 --> 21:49.800
Oh, you're hooked already.

21:49.800 --> 21:50.800
OK.

21:50.800 --> 21:51.800
And SQLite.

21:51.800 --> 21:52.800
OK.

21:52.800 --> 21:53.800
OK.

21:53.800 --> 21:54.800
Now, this is a real fresh product.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.760
I mean, we're talking updated just as a matter a couple of days ago.

21:56.760 --> 22:00.400
It's a distributed search engine using BitTorrent and SQLite.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.560
And that's kind of a cool idea.

22:02.560 --> 22:07.360
So site owners create a SQLite database and create a torrent file from this.

22:07.360 --> 22:11.480
They then proceed to seed this torrent, just like they would seed any other file.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.640
Site users then start downloading the site torrent.

22:13.640 --> 22:18.880
But rather than downloading pieces of a torrent, they download pieces based on a search query

22:18.880 --> 22:19.880
they've performed.

22:19.880 --> 22:23.600
In other words, a given search query, such as Indiana Jones, Torrent Peak knows how to

22:23.600 --> 22:27.720
download pieces of a torrent where data for Indiana Jones is likely to be stored at.

22:27.720 --> 22:30.680
Results are given to users in a timely manner without having to wait for the entire database

22:30.680 --> 22:31.840
to download.

22:31.840 --> 22:35.480
And since search queries are just regular torrent piece downloads, a search query can

22:35.480 --> 22:39.560
be satisfied by many different peers in a swarm, effectively allowing for distributed

22:39.560 --> 22:40.560
search.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.560
That sounds nice.

22:41.560 --> 22:42.560
Yeah.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.960
It does have a couple of other pros, too.

22:44.960 --> 22:47.840
You can create...

22:47.840 --> 22:49.400
Hosting your own is just as simple as seeding.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.560
So if you can seed a torrent, you can do this.

22:51.560 --> 22:52.560
That's pretty great.

22:52.560 --> 22:53.560
You don't have to buy a domain name.

22:53.560 --> 22:56.180
You don't have to put it up on a server somewhere.

22:56.180 --> 23:00.880
Since you control your address, your public key, which is broadcasted via the DHT, it's

23:00.880 --> 23:05.760
much harder for governments and institutions to block the content you're sharing.

23:05.760 --> 23:09.560
And via SQL torrent, you drive your users...

23:09.560 --> 23:10.560
I don't even know what this last...

23:10.560 --> 23:11.560
It's hard to read.

23:11.560 --> 23:13.200
Anyways, but here's a couple of downsides.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.200
Read only sites for now.

23:14.200 --> 23:17.080
Your site doesn't get a pretty name.

23:17.080 --> 23:19.720
And there's really not any standards in place to do this.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.000
But the idea is kind of interesting.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Yeah, it definitely is.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.800
So I thought maybe we'd add it to the watch list and see where it goes.

23:24.800 --> 23:28.120
This seems like one of those things where you might not use it.

23:28.120 --> 23:32.920
I mean, it's not even used as a library, but it pushes things forward.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.200
We're building the tools slowly that we need to solve these problems.

23:35.200 --> 23:38.400
And Yacy is great, but it hasn't gone very far.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.900
I keep playing around with it, and it just is sort of the same.

23:41.900 --> 23:44.880
And I just wonder if something like this might come along and move things forward.

23:44.880 --> 23:45.880
Yeah, definitely.

23:45.880 --> 23:46.880
I'm always...

23:46.880 --> 23:49.280
There's always a conversation when Noah is in town.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.120
There will be when he comes in for Linux Fest Northwest.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.120
You wait.

23:52.120 --> 23:53.120
You watch for him.

23:53.120 --> 23:54.120
I'm calling it right now.

23:54.120 --> 23:57.480
It's the, you can do anything on the command line.

23:57.480 --> 24:01.120
It usually goes, well, actually, you could do that on the command line.

24:01.120 --> 24:06.040
And then the conversation between Noah the Beard and I for the next hour is, no way could

24:06.040 --> 24:07.160
you do that on the command line.

24:07.160 --> 24:12.640
And usually it's video editing, podcast editing, photo editing, something like that, where

24:12.640 --> 24:15.840
maybe you technically could do it, but if you're just so much more efficient if you

24:15.840 --> 24:16.840
have a...

24:16.840 --> 24:17.840
Yeah.

24:17.840 --> 24:21.440
Well, maybe Noah can check another one off as you can do it on the command line list,

24:21.440 --> 24:25.080
because I think he's going to have another one for his list.

24:25.080 --> 24:29.160
Audio editing of images.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.160
Audio editing...

24:30.160 --> 24:31.160
What?

24:31.160 --> 24:32.160
Of images.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.160
Yeah.

24:33.160 --> 24:34.160
Check this out.

24:34.160 --> 24:40.480
This guy, I believe it's a gentleman, has come up with an incredible way to edit images

24:40.480 --> 24:43.620
as if it was audio data.

24:43.620 --> 24:45.600
He calls it AudioShop.

24:45.600 --> 24:49.920
AudioShop is a simple script that was cobbled together that gets you started with mangling

24:49.920 --> 24:52.400
image data as if it were audio data.

24:52.400 --> 24:57.520
The script wraps three individually excellent tools, FMPEG, ImageMagick, and SOX.

24:57.520 --> 25:02.240
The way it works is by first converting an image to a raw format like YUV.

25:02.240 --> 25:04.880
This is done to prevent audio editor from destroying the structure so you still have

25:04.880 --> 25:07.800
the original PNG or JPEG or whatever.

25:07.800 --> 25:11.320
If converting to a raw format, then after it does that, it imports the raw image data

25:11.320 --> 25:14.280
into the audio editor.

25:14.280 --> 25:20.480
And he can then apply audio editor techniques to the image to get the results you'd expect.

25:20.480 --> 25:27.260
So for example, he can overdrive the signal to overdrive the image and you get a very

25:27.260 --> 25:29.440
blown out red and green image.

25:29.440 --> 25:30.440
Yeah, look at that.

25:30.440 --> 25:33.720
He can apply a reverb or an echo and you get multiple...

25:33.720 --> 25:38.320
So he has a picture here of the Eiffel Tower and you get four instances of the Eiffel Tower

25:38.320 --> 25:42.920
because he applied a reverb or an echo to the image data.

25:42.920 --> 25:47.560
You never open it up in a graphical application, all done with a script.

25:47.560 --> 25:48.560
AudioShop.

25:48.560 --> 25:49.560
It's got a great name too.

25:49.560 --> 25:51.520
Yeah, definitely.

25:51.520 --> 25:52.520
So that just came out.

25:52.520 --> 25:54.840
I think I will play with this one because it seems kind of cool.

25:54.840 --> 25:55.840
Yeah, yeah.

25:55.840 --> 25:56.840
It's up on GitHub.

25:56.840 --> 25:57.840
We'll have a link in the show notes.

25:57.840 --> 25:59.200
So that's another project we'll be keeping an eye on.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.200
It's actually not that complicated.

26:00.200 --> 26:03.960
It's like 300 lines, it's all scripted, you can go check it out.

26:03.960 --> 26:07.400
Because it's really sitting on top of FFmpeg, ImageMagick, and Socks.

26:07.400 --> 26:11.440
And so they're all doing the heavy lifting and they're all tools we're familiar with.

26:11.440 --> 26:12.960
Maybe Socks for those of you...

26:12.960 --> 26:16.680
Because you're probably all familiar with ImageMagick and FFmpeg, but Socks stands

26:16.680 --> 26:17.680
for sound exchange.

26:17.680 --> 26:21.440
It's a cross-platform utility that can convert various formats of computer audio.

26:21.440 --> 26:22.440
So you can use it...

26:22.440 --> 26:25.640
I've had clients that even use it on Windows for like a call answering system once.

26:25.640 --> 26:26.640
Oh really?

26:26.640 --> 26:27.640
Yeah.

26:27.640 --> 26:32.360
And then this is your language warning for a moment.

26:32.360 --> 26:33.360
Hello everybody.

26:33.360 --> 26:34.360
Get it out of here.

26:34.360 --> 26:40.940
You've got three seconds left before we use a swear word.

26:40.940 --> 26:45.060
The next open source project is called The Fuck, which is an app that corrects your previous

26:45.060 --> 26:46.060
console command.

26:46.060 --> 26:48.640
That's what they've called it, The Fuck.

26:48.640 --> 26:54.720
And they have a little animation here that shows it.

26:54.720 --> 26:58.640
Essentially, you type the wrong command here and it says, that command's not found.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.960
Did you actually mean this command?

27:00.960 --> 27:02.080
And if you did, you type fuck.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.640
And then it corrects the command and then runs it for you.

27:04.640 --> 27:07.200
It's pretty cool.

27:07.200 --> 27:11.720
It's just nice if you, oh, I meant to type Python, but you typo'd Python.

27:11.720 --> 27:13.360
You know, The Fuck takes care of it for you.

27:13.360 --> 27:14.360
Yeah, definitely.

27:14.360 --> 27:18.160
So that's a project that I've actually, I think I've seen before, but it looks, you

27:18.160 --> 27:23.800
know, this repo, okay, I have seen this once before, but it was updated just as of eight

27:23.800 --> 27:24.800
days ago.

27:24.800 --> 27:25.800
Days?

27:25.800 --> 27:26.800
Yeah.

27:26.800 --> 27:27.800
So I wonder how broad the support is.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.400
It's apparently pretty active in development still.

27:30.400 --> 27:33.920
There was an original version where it just added sudo in front of everything.

27:33.920 --> 27:38.080
So you screw up and forget to put sudo and you type it and then the next thing you just

27:38.080 --> 27:41.400
type in is that and then just put sudo in front.

27:41.400 --> 27:45.200
It like just converts it back into and puts some sudo in front of it before you do anything.

27:45.200 --> 27:48.760
But this is kind of cool because if it's like detecting what you're, it's even better.

27:48.760 --> 27:51.160
But if it does that and this, that's pretty cool.

27:51.160 --> 27:52.160
Yeah.

27:52.160 --> 27:53.160
So, okay.

27:53.160 --> 27:57.520
So now if that's too obscene for you, if that's too intense, then on the other end we have

27:57.520 --> 28:03.120
Tiny Care Terminal, Tiny Care Terminal with emoticons, with hard emoticons, a little dashboard

28:03.120 --> 28:06.280
that tries to take care of you when you're using the terminal.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.280
Is it that sweet?

28:07.280 --> 28:08.280
It's wonderful.

28:08.280 --> 28:09.660
It is so wonderful.

28:09.660 --> 28:12.120
This is a little dashboard that tries to take care of you.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.600
It tells you you're cute.

28:13.600 --> 28:18.320
It tells you to take care of yourself and it tries not to stress you out.

28:18.320 --> 28:24.760
It shows you the last tweets from at tiny care bot, at self care bot and magic is real

28:24.760 --> 28:25.760
bot.

28:25.760 --> 28:29.240
Oh my God.

28:29.240 --> 28:33.480
Speaking of echo chambers, the first two tend to tweet reminders about taking breaks, drinking

28:33.480 --> 28:36.200
water and taking a look outside.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.800
The latter tells you strange whimsical stories.

28:38.800 --> 28:42.560
If you don't like these bots, they're completely configurable.

28:42.560 --> 28:46.240
Your good commits from today and the last seven days will also be shown and when you

28:46.240 --> 28:49.660
get stressed out because you think you haven't done anything, it turns out it'll show you

28:49.660 --> 28:54.960
all of the hard work you've done recently and also it'll tell you about the weather

28:54.960 --> 28:56.800
because you might get rained on.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.920
Oh my God.

28:58.920 --> 29:02.920
And then so they have a screenshot here and they show you your commits today and for the

29:02.920 --> 29:03.920
week.

29:03.920 --> 29:07.960
They show you that maybe you should download a mindfulness app for your phone so you can

29:07.960 --> 29:09.840
meditate.

29:09.840 --> 29:14.760
There's a end curses type animated parrot that tells you to breathe.

29:14.760 --> 29:15.760
It looks pretty good.

29:15.760 --> 29:22.640
I mean from a design standpoint, it's a pretty handsome looking terminal app.

29:22.640 --> 29:23.640
See this is good.

29:23.640 --> 29:27.180
This like goes right back into just you could do anything on the terminal and this will

29:27.180 --> 29:29.820
help you maybe feel more at home while you're there.

29:29.820 --> 29:30.820
That is so true.

29:30.820 --> 29:31.820
Oh my gosh.

29:31.820 --> 29:33.000
This would be, you know, would be great.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
This is actually just a, this would be fantastic to replace people's shell with this.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
Right.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.200
And just so like, you know, somebody leaves the machine unlocked.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.200
This is the new thing.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.400
You change their shell to this and then they open.

29:43.400 --> 29:44.400
What the hell is this?

29:44.400 --> 29:47.480
You know, they're told to breathe deep.

29:47.480 --> 29:50.440
So they're upset, but they're not that upset because they meditate about it.

29:50.440 --> 29:53.520
They're like, okay, well it's cool, man.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.520
If they get upset, you just give them the Care Bear stare.

29:55.520 --> 29:57.280
Oh, that always helps.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.320
So there you go.

29:59.320 --> 30:03.720
There's a couple of open source projects to help make things right in the world that we're

30:03.720 --> 30:04.720
watching.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.760
There's also one that's not really a project, just kind of a neat idea.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.760
I think it's by a guy named Scott.

30:10.760 --> 30:15.680
So Scott had a great idea and I don't know why Red Hat or somebody else like the Linux

30:15.680 --> 30:20.640
Foundation hasn't thought of this, but it's linuxlifecycle.com and I guess what it does,

30:20.640 --> 30:25.520
it tells you how long the support cycles are on major distributions in one place.

30:25.520 --> 30:26.520
Simply easy.

30:26.520 --> 30:30.160
I mean, it's not an official page put together by like Linus Torvalds.

30:30.160 --> 30:35.720
I mean, it's not, it's a guy named Scott doing this, but hopefully he keeps it up.

30:35.720 --> 30:39.840
And so he breaks it down with Red Hat and CentOS, Ubuntu and Debian, and he tells you

30:39.840 --> 30:44.000
which releases are still supported and when the end of life is.

30:44.000 --> 30:49.120
And it's focused on enterprise, but it looks like Scott plans to set up like an API as

30:49.120 --> 30:54.440
data is JSON, so people can, this could eventually be a legitimate resource for this kind of

30:54.440 --> 30:55.440
thing.

30:55.440 --> 30:58.040
And it could be expanded to cover a lot more, especially if there's a JSON where you could

30:58.040 --> 31:00.320
pull out other distros and display it on your own page.

31:00.320 --> 31:01.320
I mean.

31:01.320 --> 31:02.320
The API, you could have like monitors.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.000
Your software is going to go out of state.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.160
How does DistroWatch not have this?

31:09.160 --> 31:11.440
They have individual things.

31:11.440 --> 31:12.440
I like how.

31:12.440 --> 31:13.440
They have a list.

31:13.440 --> 31:17.360
There's Wikipedia has a list too, so maybe he's like just collecting all the information

31:17.360 --> 31:18.360
and putting it in one place.

31:18.360 --> 31:19.360
Yeah, it's nice.

31:19.360 --> 31:23.800
And you see how he displays it in like these easy, so he's got rel7, rel6 and rel5, green

31:23.800 --> 31:26.880
check mark, green check mark, RedX.

31:26.880 --> 31:29.860
Nice and clear, really straightforward, easy to understand.

31:29.860 --> 31:33.520
So if you, you know, if you don't often, this would be perfect for somebody like me.

31:33.520 --> 31:39.360
Like if I had mostly worked when I was in IT, I'd either be rel, CentOS or Debian Ubuntu.

31:39.360 --> 31:44.240
I wouldn't very often sit down at the SUSE machine after I left banking.

31:44.240 --> 31:47.800
But if I did, I could easily just go to this page and say, okay, well, I'm on SUSE Enterprise

31:47.800 --> 31:48.800
10.

31:48.800 --> 31:51.560
Oh man, it was end of life on July 31st, 2013.

31:51.560 --> 31:53.000
I've really got to get this client to update.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.440
I mean, it's just those sort of simple things because when you go look it up from the vendor

31:56.440 --> 32:00.040
themselves, you read all this weird vendor speak and you have to dig through these knowledge

32:00.040 --> 32:01.040
bases.

32:01.040 --> 32:02.040
That's nice to see.

32:02.040 --> 32:06.040
That's linuxlifecycle.com if you want to check for yourself.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.040
Pretty handy.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.040
Pretty handy.

32:08.040 --> 32:11.000
I'd be okay with some free BSD or other things on there as well.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
I'm sorry, what?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Just saying.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Just saying.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
I blacked out for a second.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.440
A broader list, right?

32:16.440 --> 32:18.600
Just maybe on a secondary page.

32:18.600 --> 32:25.480
It makes so much sense for a BSD kernel to be on a website called Linux Life Cycle.

32:25.480 --> 32:29.720
I mean, it's not like there's a lot of BSDs to keep track of either.

32:29.720 --> 32:30.720
True.

32:30.720 --> 32:32.320
See, it's a small ass.

32:32.320 --> 32:36.240
We have some huge BSD news to talk about today on the show.

32:36.240 --> 32:37.520
We've got to talk about FreeNAS Coral.

32:37.520 --> 32:40.640
In fact, we're going to do that in just a second, but I wanted to ask you before we

32:40.640 --> 32:46.600
do it, do you mostly now use Ubuntu at work for the server side?

32:46.600 --> 32:47.600
Yes.

32:47.600 --> 32:48.600
No CentOS Red Hat?

32:48.600 --> 32:50.600
No, there is some CentOS.

32:50.600 --> 32:51.600
Oh, okay.

32:51.600 --> 32:52.600
But for what you touch?

32:52.600 --> 32:53.600
Yeah.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.760
I've been pretty much exclusively Ubuntu.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.880
You know what you need to get your hands on?

32:57.880 --> 32:59.360
A new Linux Action Show t-shirt.

32:59.360 --> 33:00.360
What?

33:00.360 --> 33:01.360
Yeah.

33:01.360 --> 33:03.120
So Linux Action Show, there's three episodes left, and people have been like, Chris, you've

33:03.120 --> 33:07.160
got to do a going away swag, teespring.com slash all good things.

33:07.160 --> 33:11.120
It is my favorite version of the logo we've ever done, and I kind of wish we would have

33:11.120 --> 33:12.120
done this all the time.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.120
Yeah, that's nice.

33:13.120 --> 33:17.500
We wanted to have something special as like a final edition, so we tweaked our Linux Action

33:17.500 --> 33:21.700
Show logo to represent the runtime of the show, so it's like a commemorative edition

33:21.700 --> 33:27.960
of the shirt, but we also gave Tux a dignified badass beard.

33:27.960 --> 33:32.440
I don't know why all Tuxes should have a beard like this.

33:32.440 --> 33:36.680
This is something the community should take and run with, but it starts here.

33:36.680 --> 33:37.720
The revolution starts here.

33:37.720 --> 33:40.920
You go to teespring.com slash all good things.

33:40.920 --> 33:45.120
We've got a t-shirt, a hoodie, and a long sleeve.

33:45.120 --> 33:49.720
I'm mentioning it in this show because with only three episodes left, it's not like this

33:49.720 --> 33:51.520
is going to be something we're going to be promoting very much.

33:51.520 --> 33:52.520
We're doing it right now.

33:52.520 --> 33:53.520
Yeah.

33:53.520 --> 33:56.880
Anyways, check it out, teespring.com slash all good things, and you've already got one

33:56.880 --> 33:57.880
on the way.

33:57.880 --> 33:58.880
Ooh.

33:58.880 --> 33:59.880
Mm-hmm.

33:59.880 --> 34:00.880
Rumor has it, Wes.

34:00.880 --> 34:01.880
Rumor has it.

34:01.880 --> 34:07.120
This is a big story that I think happened while I was still in Arizona, and I tried

34:07.120 --> 34:09.440
to follow it as closely as possible.

34:09.440 --> 34:12.160
I'm not putting RIP on the back.

34:12.160 --> 34:14.120
Oh my gosh, iMacon.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.760
Oh my gosh.

34:15.760 --> 34:16.760
A purple hoodie.

34:16.760 --> 34:20.440
You know they have, by the way, I think... Sorry, you blame iMacon.

34:20.440 --> 34:21.920
He's just sidetracked me again.

34:21.920 --> 34:22.920
Blame.

34:22.920 --> 34:23.920
Blame him.

34:23.920 --> 34:24.920
It's totally his fault.

34:24.920 --> 34:30.280
So I think if you look at the shirt, they have some interesting sizes this year.

34:30.280 --> 34:33.960
I think they have different sizes or something, so you might look at the... Yeah, okay, okay.

34:33.960 --> 34:35.960
I'm looking at the long sleeve too.

34:35.960 --> 34:42.960
Anyways, teespring.com slash all good things, and if you guys are Star Trek fans, you probably

34:42.960 --> 34:44.520
get the reference to the... Do you get it?

34:44.520 --> 34:45.520
Oh yeah.

34:45.520 --> 34:46.520
You do?

34:46.520 --> 34:47.520
I'm proud of you, Wes.

34:47.520 --> 34:48.520
I'm proud of you.

34:48.520 --> 34:55.280
So anyways, this was a huge story that I was trying to follow because we're a FreeNAS user

34:55.280 --> 34:57.400
here at Jupiter Broadcasting.

34:57.400 --> 35:01.600
We have friends that work on the FreeNAS project.

35:01.600 --> 35:08.400
I love the folks over at IX Systems who are the sponsors of the FreeNAS project.

35:08.400 --> 35:12.760
It's the BSD thing that even gets Linux users to turn their heads and use it, right?

35:12.760 --> 35:13.760
Everybody loves FreeNAS.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.440
Noah's all in on FreeNAS.

35:16.440 --> 35:24.200
It's sort of the number one DIY NAS solution, and then when you combine it with some of

35:24.200 --> 35:28.680
IX's hardware, it can be a serious business solution too.

35:28.680 --> 35:36.960
So everybody had their eyes on FreeNAS 10, aka FreeNAS Coral, and Jordan Hubbard, which

35:36.960 --> 35:40.400
is one of the guys that's been... He'd been at IX for a long time.

35:40.400 --> 35:46.040
He's up in the high ranks, very, very involved with the FreeNAS 10 project.

35:46.040 --> 35:48.720
He gave us a demo when I was at MeetBSD California.

35:48.720 --> 35:49.720
Oh, really?

35:49.720 --> 35:53.860
Yeah, he gave us... Man, Wes, he was showing... First of all, this was like this revolutionary

35:53.860 --> 35:54.860
new UI for FreeNAS.

35:54.860 --> 35:59.840
I mean, it had gone from the FreeNAS UI we might know to this totally new dark-themed

35:59.840 --> 36:00.840
click and drag.

36:00.840 --> 36:04.720
He did this maneuver where he added 35 hard drives at once to this FreeNAS server because

36:04.720 --> 36:06.720
they had this huge, crazy setup back at IX.

36:06.720 --> 36:07.720
Naturally.

36:07.720 --> 36:08.920
He had VPNed into.

36:08.920 --> 36:15.520
And so he VPNs into his... He's up on stage at MeetBSD, and this is out of Berkeley, one

36:15.520 --> 36:20.200
of the Berkeley campuses, so everybody's in this auditorium, and we're all watching Jordan

36:20.200 --> 36:24.780
up on stage as he gets up there and VPNs back into IX systems and connects to this monster

36:24.780 --> 36:28.520
demo FreeNAS rig, Coral rig.

36:28.520 --> 36:32.200
He's talking about all of the massive changes, and he's talking about the fact that they're

36:32.200 --> 36:37.920
rolling out Docker support, and this totally new UI, and this engine, and they're rebasing

36:37.920 --> 36:42.440
on this version of FreeBSD, and all of these fundamental changes.

36:42.440 --> 36:49.240
My last show before I left for Texas, the last show with Linux Unplugged I did, I sort

36:49.240 --> 36:50.240
of gave a heads up.

36:50.240 --> 36:53.240
I was like, I'm hearing some bad things about... I mean, I'm hearing people are getting

36:53.240 --> 36:56.240
a little concerned about FreeNAS 10, and I'm hearing some bad things, like plugins are

36:56.240 --> 37:00.940
getting disabled, your data's safe, but you've got to reset up all your plugins in Docker.

37:00.940 --> 37:03.200
People are not super thrilled.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.200
Just FYI.

37:04.200 --> 37:07.760
It was kind of like the general vibe of the coverage right before I left for Texas.

37:07.760 --> 37:14.080
And then while I was gone, huge news, huge, huge news from the FreeNAS project, and it's

37:14.080 --> 37:21.480
the kind of news that sort of sticks to a project for a while, and I think maybe it

37:21.480 --> 37:25.840
explains why when last time I was on the show, we talked about Jordan leaving IX to go into

37:25.840 --> 37:28.480
the bio... he couldn't do a bio field.

37:28.480 --> 37:34.760
Well, I think now we know why he left, and so we're going to talk about all of that first.

37:34.760 --> 37:35.880
I want to say thanks to Ting.

37:35.880 --> 37:40.760
Go to linux.ting.com to support the show, and save $25 off your device.

37:40.760 --> 37:46.520
Or if you have a CDMA or GSM device, whoa, yeah, because you know, everybody's got one

37:46.520 --> 37:47.520
these days.

37:47.520 --> 37:48.520
Heck yes.

37:48.520 --> 37:49.520
Just check their BYOD page.

37:49.520 --> 37:50.520
It's probably compatible.

37:50.520 --> 37:51.520
Then you get $25 in service credit.

37:51.520 --> 37:52.880
And you know what, Wes?

37:52.880 --> 37:53.880
Average monthly Ting bill?

37:53.880 --> 37:54.880
$23.

37:54.880 --> 37:55.880
What?

37:55.880 --> 37:56.880
Mm-hmm.

37:56.880 --> 38:00.680
It's pretty cool, because they've got... so this is the genius of it.

38:00.680 --> 38:05.840
So it turns out, guys, it's 2017, and the cellular infrastructure in the United States

38:05.840 --> 38:07.760
is pretty much in place.

38:07.760 --> 38:10.720
Everybody's heard of cell phones at this point.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.360
We've all kind of got it figured out.

38:12.360 --> 38:14.520
So Ting wanted to do something that was really different.

38:14.520 --> 38:17.080
Now, I've been a Ting customer now for like two and a half, three years.

38:17.080 --> 38:18.080
I don't know.

38:18.080 --> 38:22.440
I mean, it's been a long time, and I love it, because they are an MVNO.

38:22.440 --> 38:26.160
They are able to ride on top of other carrier networks that they create agreements with,

38:26.160 --> 38:30.600
and they can create these agreements sort of as business needs drive it, so that they

38:30.600 --> 38:32.860
have sort of an incredible flexibility here.

38:32.860 --> 38:35.440
But the big thing is, is they're not out there digging holes in the ground and putting up

38:35.440 --> 38:36.440
big towers.

38:36.440 --> 38:41.780
I've actually had clients that were responsible for designing and zoning cell towers.

38:41.780 --> 38:43.400
It's an entire industry on its own.

38:43.400 --> 38:48.040
It is the kind of industry that only multi-billion dollar corporations can even think of getting

38:48.040 --> 38:49.040
into.

38:49.040 --> 38:51.560
And so Ting said, well, let's just short circuit all of that.

38:51.560 --> 38:55.400
So they took the MVNO approach, and by creating agreements with multiple cellular providers,

38:55.400 --> 39:02.480
DMA and GSM networks, they can invest in things like an in-house call center of human beings

39:02.480 --> 39:04.800
that work there in the office with them.

39:04.800 --> 39:07.840
Their support staff actually works in the building.

39:07.840 --> 39:11.880
That's where they can spend money on their website, and on their app, and on customer

39:11.880 --> 39:15.720
service, and on creating incredibly competitive pricing plans.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.720
It's pay for what you use wireless.

39:17.720 --> 39:20.800
It's $6 a month, and then just your usage on top of that.

39:20.800 --> 39:21.800
They got a great dashboard.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.760
You can turn services on and off as you need it.

39:23.760 --> 39:24.840
You want to turn off a line.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.160
There's no early termination fee.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.600
There's no contract.

39:27.600 --> 39:28.600
You don't want data.

39:28.600 --> 39:29.600
You need data.

39:29.600 --> 39:30.600
You only want calls.

39:30.600 --> 39:31.600
You only want text.

39:31.600 --> 39:32.600
You can do it all with Ting.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.120
And they've got a savings calculator you can try out.

39:34.120 --> 39:37.520
And when you go there, linux.ting.com, also check out their blog.

39:37.520 --> 39:41.340
If you've switched to Ting since you've heard some of our ads, and you have a story to share,

39:41.340 --> 39:44.160
you could win $100 Ting credit.

39:44.160 --> 39:48.640
Just start by going to linux.ting.com, and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring this

39:48.640 --> 39:50.920
here, Unplugged Program.

39:50.920 --> 39:55.440
So let's finish the FreeNAS thing, because we started that, then we'll get to Mobi.

39:55.440 --> 39:57.360
Mobi is happening right now.

39:57.360 --> 40:00.720
There's a DockerCon going on, and it's all happening.

40:00.720 --> 40:03.560
But while I was gone, FreeNAS Coral was canned.

40:03.560 --> 40:04.560
Development was halted.

40:04.560 --> 40:09.600
It was relegated to technology preview status.

40:09.600 --> 40:14.440
They're going to revert back to the FreeNAS 9 code base.

40:14.440 --> 40:18.760
My rough understanding, and I'm going to tell you that I don't know much, and you could

40:18.760 --> 40:22.720
get a much better, much clearer explanation tomorrow on BSD Now, because I think they're

40:22.720 --> 40:27.360
going to have Chris Moore on to talk about all of this.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.800
And Alan happens to know Chris, so that should work out pretty well.

40:29.800 --> 40:31.520
They should be able to cover this.

40:31.520 --> 40:37.120
I would expect BSD Now to have probably the best coverage out there tomorrow.

40:37.120 --> 40:41.920
But what I seem to understand at this point is that there was essentially two teams on

40:41.920 --> 40:43.200
FreeNAS working FreeNAS.

40:43.200 --> 40:46.600
There's the FreeNAS 9 team kind of keeping that going and supported, and then there was

40:46.600 --> 40:50.320
Jordan's team, which was sort of creating the new revolutionary product, the FreeNAS

40:50.320 --> 40:52.640
Coral.

40:52.640 --> 40:57.780
And what happened is their internal metrics were showing that they were having a massive

40:57.780 --> 41:03.640
abandon rate of FreeNAS Coral, something like a huge percentage.

41:03.640 --> 41:06.400
I think it's maybe somewhere in the 50% range or greater.

41:06.400 --> 41:12.080
We're reverting back to FreeNAS 9, and so they were just seeing... I think that metric,

41:12.080 --> 41:16.720
this is from what I've read, I think that metric freaked them out the most.

41:16.720 --> 41:19.840
And they probably said, Jordan, you should probably go find something else to do.

41:19.840 --> 41:21.920
We're going to not do this anymore.

41:21.920 --> 41:26.200
And the team that they had kept around working on FreeNAS 9, in the meantime, was shoring

41:26.200 --> 41:31.820
up the existing base, was developing a new UI, and actually has a lot of super great

41:31.820 --> 41:35.160
plans in place already for FreeNAS 9.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.720
Chris Moore was pretty clear about some of the features they're working on in a forum

41:37.720 --> 41:41.440
post, and he was already showing screenshots of the new UI.

41:41.440 --> 41:45.000
They're working, I think, maybe on getting some of the FreeNAS Coral plug-ins to work

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
as well under...

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Okay.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Yeah.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.800
So, I mean, they're definitely doing a pretty tight about face, and have a pretty good plan

41:51.800 --> 41:55.880
B, but there is some egg on the face here, because FreeNAS has sort of achieved this

41:55.880 --> 42:01.320
rock solid appliance status, and when you take a big leap like this, and it doesn't

42:01.320 --> 42:07.000
land right, it can sometimes, that can stick to the reputation of the project a bit.

42:07.000 --> 42:11.440
Now I got to really think that any serious enterprise installation wasn't jumping to

42:11.440 --> 42:15.720
the next version of FreeNAS yet, so the effect rate is probably exaggerated.

42:15.720 --> 42:19.040
Hopefully it's just people who are curious about it.

42:19.040 --> 42:21.960
I think probably because the type of user base it was updating is the type of user base

42:21.960 --> 42:26.920
that goes to Reddit forums and IRCs, it's probably more of an exaggerated issue, but

42:26.920 --> 42:30.760
they have their own internal metrics that showed that there was a high abandonment rate.

42:30.760 --> 42:31.760
That's my understanding, at least.

42:31.760 --> 42:35.480
And it sounds like they have a pretty good plan going forward.

42:35.480 --> 42:38.880
But whew, that is a rough thing to do.

42:38.880 --> 42:39.880
Yeah.

42:39.880 --> 42:40.880
Yeah.

42:40.880 --> 42:41.880
And, you know.

42:41.880 --> 42:44.240
Not the kind of thing you want to see for your storage appliance.

42:44.240 --> 42:45.240
Yeah.

42:45.240 --> 42:46.240
Yeah.

42:46.240 --> 42:47.600
50%, it was 50%, says the chat room.

42:47.600 --> 42:51.720
Yeah, that's a huge, that's a huge reversion rate.

42:51.720 --> 42:55.440
So Chris will be on BSD Now tomorrow to talk more about it, so I'll be watching that, because

42:55.440 --> 42:57.160
that, that affects us.

42:57.160 --> 43:01.040
So let's talk about, we have a little, right now while we're recording this show, there's

43:01.040 --> 43:03.040
a little bit of breaking news.

43:03.040 --> 43:04.040
What?

43:04.040 --> 43:07.760
CNN breaking news.

43:07.760 --> 43:15.120
The DockerCon in Austin, Texas is going on right now, and the Docker company announced

43:15.120 --> 43:16.120
Moby.

43:16.120 --> 43:19.320
And I wasn't really going to talk about it on the show, but after going back and forth

43:19.320 --> 43:22.840
a lot in chat, you and I actually kind of whittled down what the hell this is and why

43:22.840 --> 43:26.160
it actually matters, and why it could be a good thing.

43:26.160 --> 43:27.280
So we're going to talk about it now.

43:27.280 --> 43:31.920
But I want to start just reading it to you, and I want to see, okay, somebody, let's see,

43:31.920 --> 43:36.040
let's, we got to pick, I say, let's, let's, William, are you up for a game?

43:36.040 --> 43:37.840
Is he there?

43:37.840 --> 43:38.840
William, are you there?

43:38.840 --> 43:39.840
How about, okay.

43:39.840 --> 43:40.840
Let's, let's pick on Rotten.

43:40.840 --> 43:42.840
Michael, are you up for a game?

43:42.840 --> 43:45.360
Somebody, somebody, nobody.

43:45.360 --> 43:46.520
It depends on the kind of game.

43:46.520 --> 43:51.720
Well, I'm going to read to you the description of the Moby project, and I want you to guess

43:51.720 --> 43:53.680
what it is that it does.

43:53.680 --> 43:54.680
Fun.

43:54.680 --> 43:55.680
Okay.

43:55.680 --> 44:00.360
So the Moby project is a new open source project to advance the software containerization

44:00.360 --> 44:04.600
movement and help the ecosystem take containers mainstream.

44:04.600 --> 44:05.600
Okay.

44:05.600 --> 44:11.120
No, yeah, I wouldn't have a guess, but that's, that's their description.

44:11.120 --> 44:12.120
All right.

44:12.120 --> 44:13.120
I'll read a little more.

44:13.120 --> 44:16.800
It provides a library of components, a framework for assembling them into custom container

44:16.800 --> 44:23.680
based systems, and a place for all container enthusiasts to experiment and exchange ideas.

44:23.680 --> 44:25.480
Is it a store or something?

44:25.480 --> 44:26.480
I know, or a forum.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.400
It could be like something like a discussion forum, right?

44:28.400 --> 44:29.400
All right.

44:29.400 --> 44:30.400
I'll read a little more for you.

44:30.400 --> 44:33.880
I mean, you know, we just got to go through this corporate ease.

44:33.880 --> 44:36.360
Maybe we can figure it out if we just read a little more.

44:36.360 --> 44:40.840
It turns out that Docker has been innovating in open source.

44:40.840 --> 44:45.200
As a company, Docker uses open source as their innovation lab, they say.

44:45.200 --> 44:48.920
And last year, our customers started to ask for Docker on many platforms beyond Linux,

44:48.920 --> 44:54.960
Mac, Windows, and desktop, and Windows servers, and cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Googs.

44:54.960 --> 44:58.480
We created a dozen Docker editions specialized for these platforms in order to be able to

44:58.480 --> 45:02.240
build and ship these specialized editions in a relatively short time with small teams

45:02.240 --> 45:07.040
in a scalable way without having to reinvent components, but also assemble components and

45:07.040 --> 45:11.380
borrow an idea from the car industry where assemblies of components and reuse to build

45:11.380 --> 45:12.880
completely different cars.

45:12.880 --> 45:13.880
Okay.

45:13.880 --> 45:16.520
Oh, see, I know exactly what this is now.

45:16.520 --> 45:19.120
So okay, so we've read quite a bit.

45:19.120 --> 45:22.600
In fact, we've read through the entire description of what this is now.

45:22.600 --> 45:25.120
That is the extent of what it is.

45:25.120 --> 45:35.320
Then they then later reiterate that it's a library, a framework, and a reference assembly.

45:35.320 --> 45:40.160
It took Wes and I five minutes in chat to parse what the hell any of this means, and

45:40.160 --> 45:43.800
I bring this up just simply because I find this astonishing that first of all, a company

45:43.800 --> 45:46.280
... Well, actually, I think it plays a larger role here.

45:46.280 --> 45:48.760
I think I figured out what my problem with Docker is.

45:48.760 --> 45:52.440
My problem with Docker is they're shipping... They're basically taking advantage of

45:52.440 --> 45:54.720
a feature that comes built into the operating system.

45:54.720 --> 45:59.360
And so because that's such a commoditized product, they have to commoditize the ecosystem.

45:59.360 --> 46:02.080
They have to monetize the ecosystem.

46:02.080 --> 46:05.280
And so Docker has to come up with a way to be relevant when you can mix and match your

46:05.280 --> 46:06.280
environment.

46:06.280 --> 46:13.680
In fact, in here in this blog post, they talk about containers have been massively adopted,

46:13.680 --> 46:19.360
but in a lot of cases, customers are building their own unique individualized component

46:19.360 --> 46:26.000
stacks for their particular industry like manufacturing, or healthcare, or web hosting.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.760
And that translates to Docker not being in the game.

46:28.760 --> 46:32.320
The problem is that people... Because you can just use built-in components in the operating

46:32.320 --> 46:36.080
system, you don't really have to use Docker if you just need something specific.

46:36.080 --> 46:39.400
If you don't need to share with the wider Docker ecosystem, right?

46:39.400 --> 46:42.080
So they had to come up with a way to solve this problem because the issue is-

46:42.080 --> 46:43.080
How do we get to there?

46:43.080 --> 46:46.640
The issue is they're selling water to a community that has a town well.

46:46.640 --> 46:50.300
And so they have to either sell the cups or the buckets.

46:50.300 --> 46:53.680
And so they've come up with a way to sell more buckets, in a sense, right?

46:53.680 --> 46:54.680
What is Mobi, Wes?

46:54.680 --> 46:55.680
Help me understand.

46:55.680 --> 47:00.360
Mobi is like a toolkit for making something like Docker.

47:00.360 --> 47:06.080
So it's frameworks, libraries, tools to help you take various pieces of what you might

47:06.080 --> 47:11.080
need for a full containerized application, maybe even distributed, right?

47:11.080 --> 47:17.480
So like schedulers, loggers, storage appliances or abstractions, networking configurations,

47:17.480 --> 47:18.480
all of those things, right?

47:18.480 --> 47:19.600
You can get with different pieces.

47:19.600 --> 47:22.240
Sure, right now it uses all the default Docker things, right?

47:22.240 --> 47:24.440
So container D is their default runtime.

47:24.440 --> 47:29.640
But in theory, they're trying to make it so you can then easily and with tools to help

47:29.640 --> 47:33.480
distribute them, package them, slot these pieces in and out.

47:33.480 --> 47:38.320
So you could use Rocket or LXD maybe instead of Docker as the runtime, but you could still

47:38.320 --> 47:39.560
use the Docker...

47:39.560 --> 47:43.360
Yeah, or maybe even something as minimal as Run C or other things, yeah.

47:43.360 --> 47:44.360
I don't know.

47:44.360 --> 47:45.360
I've not played with it.

47:45.360 --> 47:46.960
They do have a GitHub page up.

47:46.960 --> 47:50.600
It actually looks like Docker is moving all of their open source things under the Mobi

47:50.600 --> 47:52.160
project now.

47:52.160 --> 47:56.100
So here's what I found interesting about the story, is essentially what happened at Docker

47:56.100 --> 48:00.800
is they had to come up with a way to create Docker for Windows and for the Mac and all

48:00.800 --> 48:02.740
these other web cloud platforms.

48:02.740 --> 48:06.200
And I have wondered, how the hell are they building all these additions and not being

48:06.200 --> 48:09.600
crushed by the weight of maintaining all these different versions of Docker?

48:09.600 --> 48:13.680
Because the whole idea seems like it's just insane from a maintenance standpoint.

48:13.680 --> 48:17.680
Especially if it's like the same, it started as this very like Linux specific thing.

48:17.680 --> 48:18.680
Yeah, yes.

48:18.680 --> 48:24.040
So what they did is they took the tool that they created to do all that work and they're

48:24.040 --> 48:26.560
now releasing it open source and calling it Mobi.

48:26.560 --> 48:29.840
And that's what this really is, is this is what let them build this mix and match pieces.

48:29.840 --> 48:33.960
So on Windows, you can use the Docker runtime but use the Windows event log for logs and

48:33.960 --> 48:35.600
stuff like that.

48:35.600 --> 48:40.080
So anyways, Mobi project, big news everybody, and it probably actually will be a good way

48:40.080 --> 48:42.920
for Docker to stay in the game even when you're not using a Docker stack.

48:42.920 --> 48:46.760
Well, I think the thing they're missing is they haven't really convinced me yet because

48:46.760 --> 48:48.720
they have to tell me about their synergy.

48:48.720 --> 48:49.720
Right?

48:49.720 --> 48:50.720
Yeah, definitely.

48:50.720 --> 48:51.920
You should read there and count how many...

48:51.920 --> 48:56.680
Wes and I were joking in chat that like they had like a quota of how many times they had

48:56.680 --> 48:57.680
to say open source.

48:57.680 --> 49:01.380
They were just throwing open source in there randomly, yeah.

49:01.380 --> 49:02.480
It's super thick.

49:02.480 --> 49:06.280
It's almost like they don't want you to understand what it is they're doing because there's easier

49:06.280 --> 49:08.620
clearer ways to describe that.

49:08.620 --> 49:13.200
I think the way we just described it is more clear and they didn't choose that.

49:13.200 --> 49:15.100
And then you have to wonder what's the intent behind that.

49:15.100 --> 49:17.000
Why are you choosing to write so thick?

49:17.000 --> 49:18.840
That's the best I can describe it.

49:18.840 --> 49:23.660
Like, you know, you take a look at the Solace project, nice, concise, clear communication

49:23.660 --> 49:26.440
both in social and on their official blog post.

49:26.440 --> 49:31.900
And part of that is because, you know, Josh is a great communicator but our friends over

49:31.900 --> 49:35.800
at Solace have a new release that I think we'll talk more about next week after I've

49:35.800 --> 49:40.320
had a chance to run it but what's interesting about this release is it's the first official

49:40.320 --> 49:43.520
GNOME edition of Solace.

49:43.520 --> 49:44.520
And also...

49:44.520 --> 49:45.520
Interesting.

49:45.520 --> 49:48.000
If you recall our conversation with Ikey a couple of weeks ago where he talked about

49:48.000 --> 49:50.240
Clear Boot and doing bulletproof boot management.

49:50.240 --> 49:51.640
Yes, I'm very interested in that.

49:51.640 --> 49:53.440
This is the first version that ships with that.

49:53.440 --> 49:54.440
Okay.

49:54.440 --> 49:57.220
Yeah, so the Clear Boot manager is in there now which means down the road it'll be easy

49:57.220 --> 49:58.880
to run different types of kernels.

49:58.880 --> 50:02.080
It'll be easy to roll back if there's a kernel upgrade gone wrong.

50:02.080 --> 50:04.760
I thought it was interesting is they've done a few tweaks to the GNOME stack.

50:04.760 --> 50:12.120
So it's GNOME 3.2.4 and they've made a few patches to like the EJ...

50:12.120 --> 50:13.120
Where is it?

50:13.120 --> 50:14.120
Oh, here it is.

50:14.120 --> 50:17.160
They made a few patches to resolve items not appearing in the GNOME menu.

50:17.160 --> 50:23.580
They've tweaked a few options in Nautilus, a few things for SDL games.

50:23.580 --> 50:24.920
Pretty minimal stuff.

50:24.920 --> 50:26.720
Pretty minimal stuff though for their...

50:26.720 --> 50:31.640
So it's a pretty and they've even turned on a couple of extensions like a dash to dock

50:31.640 --> 50:34.000
and a couple of other things.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.960
So otherwise they're pretty straightforward GNOME implementation and now they also have

50:36.960 --> 50:39.000
the Mate edition as well.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.480
Three flavors now of Solus started out with just...

50:41.480 --> 50:42.480
Those are all tasty.

50:42.480 --> 50:45.840
So if I want to play with the Clear Boot manager, which flavor should I pick?

50:45.840 --> 50:51.040
I want to ask Ikey if the Solus GNOME edition is a hedge against his whole switching budgie

50:51.040 --> 50:52.760
to QT blowing up.

50:52.760 --> 50:53.760
Oh, yeah.

50:53.760 --> 50:54.760
That's a good question.

50:54.760 --> 50:58.040
I mean, or is there, I mean, which is a fine motivation, is that why you're including it

50:58.040 --> 51:03.220
because you want to give the people who are going to cry wolf over the changes, you want

51:03.220 --> 51:05.520
to give them a place to go?

51:05.520 --> 51:06.520
GNOME is just everywhere now.

51:06.520 --> 51:07.520
Yeah, it is everywhere.

51:07.520 --> 51:08.520
It's just everywhere.

51:08.520 --> 51:09.520
Sounds like overnight.

51:09.520 --> 51:13.840
Like 2017 is the year of GNOME.

51:13.840 --> 51:16.160
It's what the entire internet is talking about right now.

51:16.160 --> 51:21.480
I feel bad for my Plasma desktop friends because I'm over here running Plasma desktop and I

51:21.480 --> 51:23.880
feel like I'm a loner now.

51:23.880 --> 51:26.120
We need to talk about the Church of Neon.

51:26.120 --> 51:27.120
There we go.

51:27.120 --> 51:28.120
Yes.

51:28.120 --> 51:29.120
Are you feeling this at all?

51:29.120 --> 51:30.120
Heavily.

51:30.120 --> 51:31.120
Yeah.

51:31.120 --> 51:32.120
Yeah, I am.

51:32.120 --> 51:38.320
I've actually been in conversations with many people who all the time they would say something

51:38.320 --> 51:42.200
about GNOME being like, it's so great they're switching to GNOME.

51:42.200 --> 51:47.040
Not really because it means that they're kind of abandoning all of what they were doing

51:47.040 --> 51:50.480
because they even said that they're going to ship basically what GNOME wants.

51:50.480 --> 52:00.120
So GNOME is not typically known for being receiving and receptive at all to anyone's

52:00.120 --> 52:05.640
opinion from any topic from any place in the world.

52:05.640 --> 52:11.580
So I would be shocked if Canonical had anything changed in GNOME ever.

52:11.580 --> 52:16.560
So I think that it's going to be basically just GNOME with Ubuntu slapped on top of it

52:16.560 --> 52:19.000
as like a branding and that's it.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.800
Which I consider that incredibly sad.

52:21.800 --> 52:23.320
I want to talk about that too.

52:23.320 --> 52:27.280
Let's go right into the 1704 review right now because I've been running Ubuntu GNOME

52:27.280 --> 52:36.900
1704 and while it's fine, it's very sad in a sense because so Rodden, it feels like there's

52:36.900 --> 52:38.080
no character to it.

52:38.080 --> 52:39.740
Like there's no distinctiveness.

52:39.740 --> 52:41.720
There's nothing unique about it.

52:41.720 --> 52:42.720
It's just GNOME.

52:42.720 --> 52:44.200
That's it.

52:44.200 --> 52:47.640
It's GNOME with Ubuntu branding.

52:47.640 --> 52:53.440
Which was great when I needed a refuge from Unity, which felt very Ubuntu heavy.

52:53.440 --> 52:57.840
But when there's nothing that represents Ubuntu anymore and it's just, I mean they've got

52:57.840 --> 53:02.160
to do something and it's got to be more than a wallpaper.

53:02.160 --> 53:05.520
I think that they're probably not going to do much at all.

53:05.520 --> 53:10.080
I mean I don't even think they're going to try to take over extensions at all, like even

53:10.080 --> 53:12.920
try to make a global menu or anything.

53:12.920 --> 53:17.960
I think they're just going to accept, just wash their hands of the situation of the customizations

53:17.960 --> 53:19.720
and just ship GNOME.

53:19.720 --> 53:26.020
Which I think would actually be a kind of a travesty because all of the cool innovations

53:26.020 --> 53:28.320
that they have done will be just thrown away.

53:28.320 --> 53:32.640
Yeah, I completely agree and it was weird because I didn't expect it.

53:32.640 --> 53:36.160
When I loaded Ubuntu GNOME, I was like, okay, here we go, I'm going to go to the future.

53:36.160 --> 53:42.200
I'm going to see what it's like in a future Ubuntu, oh my god, it's so sad.

53:42.200 --> 53:43.200
It's so sad.

53:43.200 --> 53:44.200
Like Antigros.

53:44.200 --> 53:46.760
You can't say that 17.10 will be different, they might do more customizations because

53:46.760 --> 53:51.320
they weren't really technically backing them yet, but I still don't think so.

53:51.320 --> 53:58.960
Yeah, Antigros has way more character and unique, Fedora even, just way more character

53:58.960 --> 54:01.800
and feel to it.

54:01.800 --> 54:05.800
Why do you pick Ubuntu?

54:05.800 --> 54:11.160
Once it's GNOME, is it just for their package repository?

54:11.160 --> 54:14.360
Compatibility, software compatibility.

54:14.360 --> 54:17.240
How does the GNOME desktop, how does it market itself there?

54:17.240 --> 54:18.240
How does it fit in with that?

54:18.240 --> 54:22.120
Well, now GNOME could be the... It's the same thing as what it was seven years

54:22.120 --> 54:28.360
ago when it was just 2010, 10.04, whatever, where it was basically GNOME, but with like

54:28.360 --> 54:31.120
... Well, okay, so I don't want to go too far

54:31.120 --> 54:33.800
down this path because I think this could be a separate discussion, but I disagree now

54:33.800 --> 54:40.640
because GNOME with GTK since 3.20 and with Flatpaks and the Software Center and all this

54:40.640 --> 54:42.880
work they've been doing with Builder.

54:42.880 --> 54:48.800
It's more now of an application target, like come write a GTK application for the GNOME

54:48.800 --> 54:49.800
platform.

54:49.800 --> 54:53.120
It's much more of that now than it was back when Canonical was originally shipping a GNOME

54:53.120 --> 54:54.120
desktop.

54:54.120 --> 54:57.400
I just wanted, before we move on, because Ike just joined us and so I want to talk about

54:57.400 --> 55:03.360
the Solus GNOME edition too while we're talking about GNOME, but Poppy, remember when Poppy

55:03.360 --> 55:04.360
used to come on this show?

55:04.360 --> 55:05.360
Yeah.

55:05.360 --> 55:06.360
Oh.

55:06.360 --> 55:07.360
That was great.

55:07.360 --> 55:08.360
I love that.

55:08.360 --> 55:09.360
I miss those guys.

55:09.360 --> 55:10.360
I miss those guys.

55:10.360 --> 55:11.360
I would love to go visit Poppy.

55:11.360 --> 55:12.360
Yeah.

55:12.360 --> 55:13.360
I would love that.

55:13.360 --> 55:14.360
That would be a lot of fun.

55:14.360 --> 55:15.360
Love that.

55:15.360 --> 55:20.000
But he did a really great blog post about how he configured GNOME on his 1604 desktop.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.320
So if you want to stick with the LTS to look more familiar.

55:24.320 --> 55:32.620
Just speaking of the Plasma thing, I made a video explaining how you could make Plasma

55:32.620 --> 55:37.360
look like Unity and function like Unity with the global menus, merging title bars, all

55:37.360 --> 55:40.240
that good stuff like the system menu and all kinds of stuff.

55:40.240 --> 55:44.600
And I think that if it wasn't even remotely possible for the canonical to even consider

55:44.600 --> 55:48.960
it that Plasma would be a fantastic foundation for Unity.

55:48.960 --> 55:52.000
And I don't mean like they should switch to Plasma.

55:52.000 --> 55:56.160
I think they should switch to Plasma for a foundation to continue the focus of Unity.

55:56.160 --> 55:58.760
Yeah, but I always thought that should have been the case when they were going to use

55:58.760 --> 56:00.360
Qt to begin with.

56:00.360 --> 56:02.120
Maybe Ike can tell us why he's not doing that.

56:02.120 --> 56:07.600
But before we get there, I also just wanted to say in the land of 1704 releases and all

56:07.600 --> 56:14.280
of the associated Ubuntu editions, our friend Wimpy has really blown the doors off with

56:14.280 --> 56:15.280
Mate 1704.

56:15.280 --> 56:18.960
And I'd say that even if he didn't come on this show.

56:18.960 --> 56:22.800
This is, I said it on last and it's true.

56:22.800 --> 56:27.600
This goes back to the era where there was a time where the dot 10 releases were so damn

56:27.600 --> 56:30.360
good that you were willing to throw out the LTS and upgrade.

56:30.360 --> 56:31.360
I remember that.

56:31.360 --> 56:32.360
That's what this is.

56:32.360 --> 56:37.880
You know, he's had work with, Ike's gone into this, work from Daniel from elementary OS

56:37.880 --> 56:38.880
has gone into this.

56:38.880 --> 56:40.680
But a lot of folks have put a lot of hard work in this.

56:40.680 --> 56:47.080
And I think it's just a killer release.

56:47.080 --> 56:52.080
And in fact, there's even a credit for producer Michael in here.

56:52.080 --> 56:53.080
Nice.

56:53.080 --> 56:55.440
What did you do, producer Michael?

56:55.440 --> 57:00.480
I helped with the graphic stuff for icons and high DPI support, stuff like that.

57:00.480 --> 57:05.840
Yeah, we've got the Brisk menu in this one that Ike helped with.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.800
It's got a really nice theme.

57:07.800 --> 57:11.840
But the other thing that I thought was just a standout feature that just makes deployment

57:11.840 --> 57:17.000
Mate desktops really nice is the software boutique now by default does queued installations.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
You can queue up a bunch of stuff.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.180
I like that.

57:19.180 --> 57:24.760
You combine that with the fact that you've got a genuine GTK3 desktop using the traditional

57:24.760 --> 57:25.920
desktop paradigm.

57:25.920 --> 57:30.080
There's more options now for like pre-configured desktops that are really great.

57:30.080 --> 57:36.040
And the theme is, I can't even believe they can make Mate look this good.

57:36.040 --> 57:37.040
So it's 17.04.

57:37.040 --> 57:40.080
I think out of all of the Mate edition of 17.04, I think out of all of them is just

57:40.080 --> 57:41.080
an easy win.

57:41.080 --> 57:42.400
Yeah, it's a really nice one.

57:42.400 --> 57:46.840
If you want to, if you're installing it for anyone, you know, who works for so many people.

57:46.840 --> 57:50.840
I wish I could have all of these things on the LTS because I have a couple of computers

57:50.840 --> 57:53.480
in the studio that I want to reinstall.

57:53.480 --> 57:58.640
And I would love to put, so I have this machine over here that runs my mixer that soon will

57:58.640 --> 58:00.360
not be running my mixer anymore.

58:00.360 --> 58:05.040
And I'd like to put Linux, I'd like to put Ubuntu Mate, but I want it to look like this.

58:05.040 --> 58:06.040
But I want an LTS.

58:06.040 --> 58:07.040
Yes.

58:07.040 --> 58:08.040
But you don't want the, yeah, the temp.

58:08.040 --> 58:09.040
Damn it, Wimpy.

58:09.040 --> 58:12.800
Also, other people should definitely, if they installed 17.04, they should make sure that

58:12.800 --> 58:19.840
they check the box for the Ubuntu Mate welcome update because it inactivates a PPA that you

58:19.840 --> 58:26.040
can continuously get things, which is really important when applications are removed from

58:26.040 --> 58:31.760
the software boutique because of, like, they're not building for 17.04.

58:31.760 --> 58:34.760
And then as soon as they start building for it, it gets added back.

58:34.760 --> 58:35.760
That's nice.

58:35.760 --> 58:36.760
Oh yeah, that's really good.

58:36.760 --> 58:38.320
And you just get the latest, if you get the latest version, you get that?

58:38.320 --> 58:42.380
Yeah, it'll automatically, if you check the box, it'll automatically update Ubuntu Mate

58:42.380 --> 58:46.040
welcome, which also updates software boutique, so every time they make a change, you get

58:46.040 --> 58:47.040
it.

58:47.040 --> 58:48.040
Perfect.

58:48.040 --> 58:51.400
I also wanted to shout out, so for those of you who, like me, are trying out Ubuntu

58:51.400 --> 58:56.720
Gnome again for kind of, like, the first time, trying it out again for the first time, it's,

58:56.720 --> 59:02.960
yeah, you may run into a few problems if you just have straight-up Chrome or now Firefox,

59:02.960 --> 59:07.640
so I have a link in the show notes on getting extensions installed, but cooler than that,

59:07.640 --> 59:12.040
you can also sync Gnome extensions between your desktops using Google Chrome, between

59:12.040 --> 59:13.040
your Gnome desktop.

59:13.040 --> 59:14.040
Really?

59:14.040 --> 59:15.040
Yeah.

59:15.040 --> 59:16.040
Tell me more.

59:16.040 --> 59:17.040
Yeah, sure.

59:17.040 --> 59:18.040
Isn't that interesting?

59:18.040 --> 59:19.040
Yeah.

59:19.040 --> 59:24.440
And you have to install the Gnome shell extension on your desktop using, there's a little sync

59:24.440 --> 59:25.440
feature in there.

59:25.440 --> 59:29.140
Once enabled, you can sync your Gnome extensions from, say, your desktop to other machines

59:29.140 --> 59:30.140
pretty much automatically.

59:30.140 --> 59:34.480
Now, you have to go in and turn the sync feature on on each computer, but once you do that,

59:34.480 --> 59:40.120
yeah, and you don't have to have, you don't have to have straight-up, like, binary from

59:40.120 --> 59:41.120
Google Chrome.

59:41.120 --> 59:43.480
You can just get Chromium from the repo if you want.

59:43.480 --> 59:44.480
Isn't that neat?

59:44.480 --> 59:45.480
Yeah, that is awesome.

59:45.480 --> 59:51.360
Yeah, and only, you have to have the corresponding Gnome shell extension, Google Chrome shell.

59:51.360 --> 59:52.360
You gotta get that.

59:52.360 --> 59:59.280
Actually, I also made an extension for basically every browser, which gives you access to download

59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.040
the zip files for each extension, so you can just, like, store them if you want.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.040
Oh, good idea.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.040
Yeah, that's nice.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:08.920
So, you need the tweak tool, you know, the Gnome tweak tool, but you just get the zip

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.400
file and just install it from there, and there you go.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.400
All right.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.680
So, let's mention DigitalOcean, then I'm gonna, let's talk to Aiki, because we gotta,

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:21.000
this is, I would like to talk about the Gnome edition, and also if Aiki feels like he's

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000
more on an isolated island with QT now than ever, now that Canonical has gotten cold feet

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
and running away.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.640
Running away from their dreams?

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:34.160
DigitalOcean.com, go fulfill your dreams with a server in the cloud on their awesome infrastructure.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:37.640
Yeah, I mean, you could go rack it if you want, if you're insane, but DigitalOcean

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.260
is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering an easy and intuitive way for

01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:42.260
you to get going.

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:45.760
You just spin up, create an account, and use our promo code DEO, unplugged, one word, and

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.120
you get a $10 credit.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:51.420
You can use that to spin up a $5 rig, run it for two months, try it out, put a project

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:54.760
on there, a blog, maybe you wanna try Mastodon.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:59.560
I've seen a couple of guides now, I was looking on the pre-show, for setting them up on DigitalOcean.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.560
Or what about Mumble?

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.560
Yeah.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.860
Mumble's another good one.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:06.680
If you wanna try out an Elias sync engine, run that on a DigitalOcean.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.680
I should probably try that again.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.320
Well, you know, they got a new version out which uses less syncing.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.320
Ooh.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.320
Less.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.760
But you can still run a component on your own server if you'd like.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.960
It's seriously easy.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:21.600
So we were talking about Docker earlier, one of the things that's really nice about DigitalOcean

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.760
is you can deploy an entire application stack with everything installed for some apps, or

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:32.000
you just do the base installation, or the sweet spot is Ubuntu LTS, Docker pre-loaded,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.800
with the repos from Docker, with the right GPG keys in there, with everything up to date,

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.800
good to go.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:38.800
Easy peasy.

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.240
Yeah, that's crazy powerful.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.960
That's just you can get trying something in no time.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.080
When you use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, you can try it out for free.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:48.720
They got data centers all over the world, and they have the best interface in the business

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.880
with an API to die for.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:51.880
An API to die for.

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:56.240
I'm trying to make it rhyme, but I need something, an API to cry, cry for the API.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.960
I cry for that API.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.960
I'm trying hard, Wes.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:01:59.960
You really are.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:04.080
Crying for that API over at DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, go spin up

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.160
a Linux rig on their infrastructure, they use KVM for the virtualizer, Linux for the

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:13.400
host, 40 gigabit connections into that hypervisor, I know it, and a beautiful control panel to

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.640
top it all off at DigitalOcean.com.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:19.560
Also, check out their block storage.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.560
It's all SSD-based.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.560
It's crazy.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.080
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.600
Ike, you're supposed to be in bed.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:29.520
You weren't going to come on the show today because you are supposed to be asleep right

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.520
now.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.480
That was the last I heard of it.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.080
You're a maniac.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.880
Well, you said things about solos.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:37.880
It's sort of like-

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:38.880
It's turned off.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:39.880
It's turned off.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:40.880
Yeah.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:41.880
It's amazing.

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:42.880
I don't know.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.880
That's almost spooky in a sense.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:47.200
So, Ike, first of all, congratulations on the new release.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.200
Yeah.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.200
Thank you very much.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.200
You've got a big deal.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.200
Got clear boot out the door.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.200
Very excited about that.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.200
Yeap.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.720
Well, let's talk about the GNOME edition because that's the big news, I think, and I say, sir,

01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.520
you're hedging.

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.520
You say I am hedging.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.520
Right?

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.840
Well, I don't know about that, but it seems like it could be a possibility.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:08.040
No, I mean, we've had GNOME in the repos for ages.

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:11.200
Like we've had GNOME, Shell, GDM, you know, it's been up on the Wiki and now the Help

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.800
Center.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:17.020
And basically, it kind of felt a bit stupid not having an ISO for it because we have the

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:20.400
infrastructure tooling and all that just to put one out.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:25.160
And especially with budget going towards in the future, having that GNOME stack there

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:28.960
and then not using it and then not making an ISO out of it kind of feels a bit stupid.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:31.960
And there are going to be people who are diehard GNOME.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.160
They want to stay on their site.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.880
So it's like, okay, well, here's an option and here's GNOME how we think it should be

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.960
within soldiers, you know, like kind of fitting with our sanity.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.720
So that's what it mostly comes down to.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:47.160
So Josh is responsible for that ISO and he uses GNOME Shell daily.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.800
Well, thank you, Josh, because I think it's going to be the one I'll be loading on my

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.180
machines for a bit, too.

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:52.440
It's fairly sexy.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:55.800
Tell me about the EGL device for EGL streams and mutter.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.080
What the hell is this and why does it matter?

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:02.560
Yeah, I mean, that's certainly not the sexiest news on the segment.

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.560
I found it interesting.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:04.560
That's what Pharaonyx picked up on.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:07.320
No, I'm sitting here and you're bum reading right off the blog post here.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:12.120
Yeah, it's basically preliminary support for the Nvidia proprietary drivers on the mutter,

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.120
so.

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:16.000
Oh, no wonder why Pharaonyx is covering it.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Yeah, that does make sense.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Yeah.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I like that, though.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.040
That actually, I'm actually I'm excited about that.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.600
I'm glad I asked.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:26.520
And then, of course, I have to ask, how is things going with Budgie?

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.120
And do you kind of feel like you're off on a cute island now?

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.000
No, not at all.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.840
I've got Budgie 10.3.1 out now.

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.320
We've actually fixed all tab.

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.320
Yeah, congrats.

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:43.040
Yeah, so basically, I kind of knew the way the release schedule was looking this weekend

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.680
and I was like, OK, let's be sensible here.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:49.320
I'm not going to get it done because I haven't got it done so far.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:53.220
So I put a bounty up and I basically said on Thursday, I think it was, if anyone can

01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:56.980
get it done before Sunday evening or was it Saturday evening, I think it was Saturday

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:57.980
evening.

01:04:57.980 --> 01:04:58.980
I'll pay you 500 euros.

01:04:58.980 --> 01:04:59.980
Wow.

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:03.400
And I was like, yeah, I mean, I wanted it done and a way for the community to get involved.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.400
That's great.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.400
I think it's awesome.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:09.360
And then there was free pull requests in and I basically said the first one that was, you

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.920
know, first value pull request came in would be merged.

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:16.440
So we had two active by the end of it and basically, they were both making fixes in

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.440
parallel.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:21.600
It's like, well, it's kind of hard to say who really came first now.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.320
I was like, OK, well, there are bugs in each.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:28.600
And this particular one, which is by a member of the community called Tim, kind of ticks

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:33.120
the boxes and it's something I can extend and fix afterwards, which it did.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:39.480
So Budgie 11 has been blocked by the lack of Budgie 10.3 because the idea was we fix

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:44.240
these last little regressions and these annoying minor bugs like Altab, right?

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.400
It was like the meme of Budgie.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:50.680
So if we can fix those, get those out of the way, then it's almost like 10.3 became a bit

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:56.560
more like, well, I guess our Unity 7, really.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.560
Already already.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:01.240
I know, too soon, too soon.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.920
So that becomes like our kind of LTS thing.

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:09.200
And it buys me time to get Budgie 11 done and done how I want to do it.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:12.760
So yeah, it's going to be cool, it's going to be cool.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.760
All right.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.840
So now I got to go get this installed on a machine.

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:16.840
Oh, yeah.

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.840
OK.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:21.960
Let's just let's play armchair futurist and let's speculate for a moment.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:26.320
What if like what if you wake up one day, you look at some statistics, some metric that

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:32.760
you look at and you say, holy crap, the gnome edition has become our number one download.

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.760
People are downloading the gnome edition above and beyond everything else.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.760
Does anything change?

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.880
Is there a is there a change in plans at all?

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:44.600
I mean, not really, because it's kind of hard to gauge that with an existing user base as

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:45.600
well.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.680
I mean, I can tell you now basically how they're doing.

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:53.160
Let's look at Linux tracker on the torrents because, you know, I mean, Ike, you think

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.160
about it.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:58.680
You're spending this weird, weird, weird time in the resurgence of gnome.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:59.680
It's huge.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:02.680
And it's I mean, it's across I mean, even solace now you can get a gnome edition.

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:07.760
And so it's really becoming it could become this really close to universal desktop.

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:08.760
Almost.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:13.200
I mean, the other the other benefit that also brings in as well is flat back.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.200
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.280
Think about it, because it's like they go hand in hand.

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:19.760
So now we know across every distribution, there's going to be known, there's going to

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:20.760
be flat back.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:21.760
Right.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:22.760
Well, that depends on your definition of benefit.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:26.440
Well, yeah, I mean, just loosely skating around that one.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:30.880
But looking at the download numbers now just for the torrents, because I know earlier on,

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.800
between two of the mirrors, they've been 800 and 700 downloads total earlier on.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:39.160
We released I think, like five o'clock this morning or something stupid.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:43.880
So the Mate ISO has had just 241 downloads.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:46.900
The gnome one has had 347 downloads.

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:49.400
So it's more popular than the Mate one now.

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.040
And the Budgie one has had 499.

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.520
The gnome one is repping pretty well.

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.760
Of course, people are curious, right?

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:55.760
They're taking a look.

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:56.760
Oh, it's now 500.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:57.760
Real sad updates.

01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:01.920
Well, and of course, I probably I don't know.

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:02.920
I don't know.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:03.920
I don't know how I'll pull it down.

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:04.920
I probably get a torrent.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:05.920
I've debated which one I want right now.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:06.920
I think I got to do the gnome one.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:07.920
I think.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:10.760
They are a little bit bigger this time.

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:14.120
Like last time, there was 900 makes or so.

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.060
And you know, like, we've been four months since we've done a release.

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:21.100
So it's been a bit of a while, you know, you're getting a bit rusty doing this kind of stuff.

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:24.460
So I started looking through some of the older YouTube reviews, and you know, even listening

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:29.120
to some of the old Linux Unplugged things, and it's like, you start to collect some of

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.120
the problems.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:33.200
And one of the ones that kept coming up is like, why is there not an office suite?

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:39.000
Ah, so now they all have an office suite in them, which basically LibreOffice, you know,

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.040
it's standard, but it's a bit chunky.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:47.040
So we put that in, taken out VLC and put in gnome MPV, but the Mate one still has VLC

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.200
because gnome MPV just looks weird there.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:51.200
Like you have to go for traditional.

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:54.840
Yeah, so now it's just under 1.2 gigs, so we got a little bit fatter.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:58.680
I think the choice to switch to gnome MPV was a good one when I saw that in the release

01:08:58.680 --> 01:08:59.680
notes, I thought.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.680
It's pretty.

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:04.360
And enabling dash to dock by default, I think is a good choice too, especially for people

01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:05.880
that come in from Unity.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:06.880
Yeah.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:11.560
The one I'm most fond of in terms of the extension there is the tray icons plus that he's put

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:12.560
in there.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.560
What was that?

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:16.640
Well, normally you get the tray icons come out on the little legacy tray on the bottom

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.800
left of the screen and just pokes out like a little freakish antenna.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:20.800
I never liked it.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.440
And now they're all up in the tray.

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.320
So it's like it's the top icons extension kind of.

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:27.480
Yeah, I think it's like top icons plus or something.

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:29.120
Yeah, top icons by legacy tray.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.120
I see.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:34.760
Yeah, that little tab just never quite, I just literally just accidentally activated

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:35.760
it.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:36.760
What is this?

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:37.760
While we're talking, I accidentally just triggered it.

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:41.280
It's always, go away, go away, and it shows up on screen all the time.

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.440
Yes, it does.

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:45.720
So we also have brisk menu now in the Mate edition.

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:49.120
They're all 0.3, 0.5, I think we're on now.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:52.120
Basically the same version as Ubuntu Mate, like we're going parallel on there.

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.120
That's great.

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.120
Mm-hmm.

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.760
And they've got a lot of theming in which I'm jealous of.

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.080
Martin got the theming sorted out.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:02.360
So it's even better integrated into Ubuntu Mate's theming now.

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:05.800
So it looks really nice over there.

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:10.200
Which also brings in with Mate 1.18, also brings in lib input, which is nice.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.200
Yeah.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:15.800
There was a bit of a bug in the last release we did back in January where, unfortunately,

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:21.400
the lib input driver got dragged in on one of the updates, which isn't fatal, but it

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.920
stopped some of the configurations from being configurable.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:24.920
I see.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:30.280
But then as soon as we put Mate 1.18, it's just like, well, now it has lib input support.

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:32.940
So that fixed that out.

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:35.640
Which means they're all using lib input now across all of the ISOs.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:39.520
I couldn't help but notice, too, there's several things in here that seem to be, well, overall

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:44.400
improvements to NVMe drives, but also sort of a secondary effect is a couple of things

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.400
in here ended up making MacBook support a little better, including better backlight

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.560
support, it looks like, and support for the 2016 SSD.

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:52.560
Yeah.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:58.760
I was looking at the 2013, 2014, and 2016 ranges of MacBooks and enabling support for

01:10:58.760 --> 01:10:59.760
them.

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:05.600
So we've got initial support for the new MacBook Pro from 2016.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.880
There's going to be some device drivers still missing, basically, until we backport more

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.880
from 4.11.

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:14.720
But we do have initial support for their NVMe drives, which that was the one that was up

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.120
in the news last year.

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.400
You couldn't use Linux on that at all.

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:21.600
So backported that, you know, while it can.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:26.320
We've got the NVMe power saving patches backported from 4.11 as well.

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:30.160
So they'll save like two to four watts or something overall.

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:34.040
So it's a slightly lower power consumption.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.520
We've also changed basically the way that we do the CPU governor now.

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:43.680
When it used to be back a while back, well, about a year back, we were always using the

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:45.240
performance governor.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:49.720
Then we changed it to on-demand or power save, depending on whether you was using Intel P-state

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:51.160
or CPU pre.

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:56.160
Now we boot up all the time in performance, and once we got to the multi-user target,

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.960
you know, using the directed system D, which everybody hates, but it was really useful

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:00.960
here.

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:01.960
So I like it for this.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:02.960
Yeah.

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:03.960
We'll then change.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.800
If you're using Intel P-state, then it'll go down into power save.

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:06.800
Sure.

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:12.320
So you end up with maximum performance for boot up, and then once the system's loaded.

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.320
Exactly.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.800
So you boot up as quick as you can and then save the battery afterwards.

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.920
It's disabled under virtualization, so it'll just stay in performance mode, which is kind

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:24.760
of logical because then it's controlled by the system outside the hypervisor anyway.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.040
That is really nice.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.040
Good.

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:28.040
That's a good way to do it.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:33.160
So you're telling me that if I blow up the Arch install on my 2013 Macbook...

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.760
When you get known 3.24, yeah.

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:41.200
You're telling me it's possible to put that Solus might work pretty good on that 2013

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:42.200
hardware?

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:43.200
Yeah.

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:46.080
I mean, I'd love to get some feedback, and if it's not, then we can just start doing

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.080
more rapid snapshots.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.080
Interesting.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:51.560
I mean, I can't get myself one anyway.

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:56.580
I would love to, but I can't really go out and justify that kind of money on one.

01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:00.600
So the more feedback they're getting, the more I can fix, really.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.600
Yeah.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:05.880
I mean, if they made it with 32 gigs of RAM, I would almost consider falling on that sword

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:10.600
just so I could also have a faster Final Cut machine, but you just can't justify it.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.080
You can't justify it.

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.800
Yeah, it's a bit of money.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:17.440
My machine would literally have to die before I could justify it.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.040
The battery's not as great as it used to be.

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.560
It's still okay, and the speakers are all right, but...

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.560
Just too useful.

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:26.080
It's just like, damn it, why won't this stupid thing die?

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.520
And then the problem is, but then I would still have...

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.520
I would have a mourning period if I had to buy a Macbook.

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:31.720
I would mourn that purchase.

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.400
We'd have to talk about it.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:34.400
Big buyer's remorse.

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:38.720
The only way I'd feel better is if I could somehow improve a distribution support.

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:39.720
So I'd do it.

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:40.720
I would do it.

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:45.440
Well, Ike, I'm pretty excited about the release just for myself, personally, because I love

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.440
the GNOME edition.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:49.060
I know it was in the repos, but you know what I always do is I would install the Budgie

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:51.600
edition and then I would go, yeah, I'm good.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.600
Yeah.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:56.440
Now you have something that's actually set up to be sane out of the box.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.440
There's no fiddling.

01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:00.600
And obviously you've got the normal stuff installed, so you've got the Chrome GNOME

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:03.160
shell extension stuff, GNOME Tweet tool, that kind of stuff.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.160
Sorry, Andy.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.160
Oh, we were just talking about that.

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.160
Cool.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.160
So that's awesome.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.800
There are a couple of updates coming through in the next day or two.

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:14.800
I basically wanted to speed up the boot even more because apparently I have something wrong

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:15.800
with me.

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:16.800
I can't stop.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.800
Yeah, I don't blame you.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:18.800
I just can't stop it.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:21.600
And I was like, oh, I've spotted an opportunity.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:27.080
So you don't quite get a silent boot at the moment, and part of that is regressing the

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:28.080
boot time.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:31.880
So I fixed that today so it's an absolutely silent boot.

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:36.200
I don't want to splash in there because then you're adding like 30 to 40 megs to every

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:40.600
upload because you're including Plimoth and then you're adding like five, six, seven seconds

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.600
to the boot.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:44.120
It's like, let's just make it silent instead.

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.120
So I've managed to do that.

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:49.200
So until X starts, you'll see nothing but black screen.

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:53.000
It's lush and that in itself on my system.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.320
So I'm already booting in about 1.7 seconds on this Broadwell NUC.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:03.060
Today I've managed to shave in over 450 milliseconds off of that.

01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:07.120
So if that's my SSD booting in that time on my Broadwell NUC, you can imagine how something

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:10.060
like Skull Canyon is going to go.

01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:14.400
Or even people with older systems because then it grows exponentially.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:19.760
So those updates we come through, we now we pre-link all of the binaries in the unit Ramfests

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:25.280
and strip them so that they actually start up quicker because they haven't got to work

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.080
with a linker to find anything.

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:30.740
We now got AMD early boot code support now as well.

01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:34.840
So that'll hot patch the microcode onto the CPU when it's starting up.

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.240
So we've got all of that sexiness to come from this couple of days.

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:41.080
And that'll be 4.9.2 free, which I got packaged today.

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:42.080
That's awesome.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.320
I mean, he doesn't fall asleep at the keyboard because he's staying up.

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.320
Yeah.

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:49.960
He's like, why does the commit message just say zzzz?

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:51.800
Well, congrats.

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.240
So the snapshot for 2017.04.18.0 is out.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.600
I'm going to go download it.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.600
And you can read.

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:03.480
I like also the nice, clear snapshot notes by Josh.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:04.840
It's nice to just read through all of that.

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:05.840
Type free.

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:06.840
Yeah.

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:07.840
Did you see the change log at the end of it?

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:08.840
Yeah, actually.

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.240
You know what I was thinking when I saw that?

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.240
That was machine-generated.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:12.240
Yeah.

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:13.240
We'll be honest.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:16.280
But it's been a long time since I've seen that, really.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.560
That doesn't happen as much anymore.

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.120
There's a few projects that still do it.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.120
Yeah.

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.760
I mean, we do that for the primary one.

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:24.920
And then when we looked at it, it was like, Jesus Christ, that's obscene.

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:27.800
We've got to include it now, right?

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.800
I love that.

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:30.800
That must be.

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:31.800
Yeah.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:34.400
We've definitely got to put that in there.

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.680
That's basically four months.

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:38.880
But that's only showing what's changed on the budget I saw.

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:39.880
Oh.

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:40.880
Oh, really?

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:41.880
Jeez.

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:43.920
Wow, that's quite the list.

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:50.720
So that's not like the repos themselves, which have now grown to such a point that, well,

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:55.120
you can imagine when we started out with Solus, like certain scripts and systems that we used,

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.120
everything just worked.

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:59.240
And we've got this script that monitors the packages coming into the repo.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:02.240
And that's been fine for a long time.

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:05.580
But we started to get to a point where we'll keep free back versions.

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:09.960
And in between those, you have the deltas, which is fine if you follow that bit so far.

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:14.200
Then when I actually counted the packages the other day in the repos, it was like 75,000

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:17.460
EL package files flown across the repo.

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:21.440
And the script that monitors them has to index the repo every single time.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.440
Oh, boy.

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:28.400
So it's going through 75,000 files just to add one new one each time.

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:32.040
I was like, right, this might have been a design flaw.

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:36.560
So that made our release 104 minutes late the other day.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.160
We started off with a different version number.

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:39.160
It was the 17th.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:44.640
And then because the script was so long, we switched back to the 18th.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:47.440
I'd already put up the Twitter post as well with the version number.

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:48.440
Yikes.

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.440
That is funny.

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:50.440
That's a good story.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:51.440
The secrets of releases.

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:54.040
Yeah, the behind the scenes secrets right there.

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:56.360
Well, Ike, thank you very much, sir, for coming on.

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:57.360
My pleasure.

01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.520
I'm glad we were able to make it work.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:03.920
And we'll have a link to the release notes in the show notes if you guys want to download.

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:07.200
And check out Ike and the team's fine, fine work.

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:10.880
They also have a link to the 1704 releases in the show notes.

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.720
There's just so much good stuff to try.

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.020
Also, go check out more of Ike on Late Night Linux.

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:17.020
That's a great podcast.

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:20.080
They just had an episode come out a couple of, or yesterday, I think.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.680
So go check all that out.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.040
Mr. Wes, where can people find you on the Twitters?

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.140
At WesPay.

01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:26.440
And also on the TechSnap program.

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:27.440
That's right.

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:28.440
Just stay tuned.

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:29.440
I'm at Chris Elias.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:30.640
The network's at Jupyter Signal.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:34.120
Find us live at JupyterBroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:37.800
We'll be back here next Tuesday.

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:24.480
I secretly use ArchLina.

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:25.480
Oh, probably stop by.

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:26.480
That was good.

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:27.480
Hey, good.

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:28.480
I thought he was able to pop in there for a second.

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:29.480
That's nice.

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:30.480
Missed you, bud.

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:33.440
I think, I think you should take the Solace challenge, Wes.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.440
Yeah.

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:35.440
I think you should do it.

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:36.440
All right.

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:37.440
It's happening.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.840
I think this machine, too, right here, possibly could be good for Solace.

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:40.840
Yes.

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:43.720
You know, now that I'm not going to be doing last, I don't have to install a whole bunch

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:45.840
of apps for the pics all the time.

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:46.840
It changes a fair bit.

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:47.840
Yeah.

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:48.840
It's changing a lot of things for me, actually.

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.880
I'm realizing all the little things in life that will be different for me.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:52.880
Yeah.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:53.880
So yeah.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:54.880
All right.

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:55.880
JupyterTitles.com, guys.

01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:56.880
JupyterTitles.com.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.080
Did you guys see the new Google Earth came out today?

01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.080
No, really?

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.080
Yeah.

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.080
Check this thing out.

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:05.740
This is, like, serious, like, 3D rendering happening.

01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:06.740
So like, yeah, look.

01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:07.740
WebGL.

01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:08.740
This is, yeah.

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:12.000
Using WebGL, we're going to zoom in here to the Eiffel Tower, and look, they 3D render

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
everything now.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Wow.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Yeah.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.400
That is actually kind of neat.

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.560
Looks pretty neat.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:21.680
And then they have this feature now where you can randomly go to cool places, like,

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:22.680
you can roll the dice.

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:23.680
Why fly?

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:24.680
You could just Google it.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:25.680
Yeah.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.680
So like, let's go over here to, like, vwoom.

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:27.680
Over to Hawaii.

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:30.000
Look at that.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Zoom right in.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
That's actually...

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
That's pretty cool.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.400
You see how it renders the mountains all cool, like, and whatnot?

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:39.400
Like, it really puts some work into this damn thing.

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:40.400
JupyterTitles.com.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.400
JupyterTitles.com.

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:42.400
Oh, sorry.

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:43.400
Hello, my group.

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:44.400
Hi.

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:45.400
I missed you.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.600
Thanks for being here, guys.

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:47.600
All y'all.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:48.600
Yes.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.600
Very much so.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:50.600
Look at that.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:51.600
How cool is that, Wes?

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:52.600
Wow.

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:53.600
All right.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:54.600
We're going to have to play with that later.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:55.600
Yeah.

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.600
It's smooth, too.

01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:57.600
Yeah.

01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.160
Well, it's not on all my computers, but on the ones with the higher-end video, dedicated

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.960
graphics, it seems to be working pretty well.

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:05.600
Now we're going to go to Lake Superior, one of the large Great Lakes in North America.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:06.600
Look at that.

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:07.600
That is big.

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:08.600
Yeah.

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:09.600
So that's the view.

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.760
And then when you zoom in, you can go to 3D mode here.

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:17.720
So if you tap 3D mode, it starts to render everything out.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.880
Oh, wow.

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:20.880
Some are better than others.

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:21.880
Yeah.

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:22.880
Yeah.

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:23.880
Look at Google Go.

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:24.880
Look at them go.

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:25.880
It's really...

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:26.880
If you think about...

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:27.880
I don't want...

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:28.880
Oh, you can...

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.080
Big Bend National Park here.

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:31.080
Let's go look at Big Bend.

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:32.080
Look.

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:33.080
We're going all around the world, Wes.

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:36.080
Going all around the world, Wes.

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:37.080
See?

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.080
And you do podcasting.

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.080
You get to travel the world.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:40.080
Look at that.

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:41.080
Yeah.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:42.080
Yeah.

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.080
Cool.

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.080
Yeah.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:45.080
All right.

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.080
JBtitles.com.

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:47.080
Yeah.

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.080
Let's pick a title.

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.080
Is there anything in the mobile room that we wanted to pick up that didn't get covered

01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:50.080
in the show?

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:51.080
Anybody want to...

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.080
Oh, there's an open floor for a couple more minutes before we go.

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.080
Ubuntu's bare gnome.

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.840
That's not bad.

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:59.000
The giant gnome rolling in the Linux.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:08.840
The chaos of disunity, gnome hunter gnawing on gnome, year of gnome, Docker's whale of

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:09.840
a tail.

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:10.840
Oh, ww.

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:11.840
Nice.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.840
You're so funny.

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:13.840
I like it.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:15.360
I see what you did there, ww.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.840
I see what you did there.

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:17.840
Tee hee.

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:18.840
Tee hee hee.

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.840
We love you.

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:20.840
Tee hee hee hee.

01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:21.840
Oh, my God.

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:29.320
Mr. Sending Man.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:32.320
Amazing.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:37.320
Oh, my God.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:40.320
Making the cutest rat I've ever seen.

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.320
That's fantastic.

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:42.320
All right.

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:45.400
And you should send me that so I can play it with high fidelity over here, because that's

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:46.400
good.

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:49.280
Yeah, that's probably not good through my mic.

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.280
Is it online?

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.280
Can you link to it?

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.280
Yeah, I can link to it over here.

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.280
That's funny.

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:56.480
I don't have the files right now, but I can get it.

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:57.480
Let's see.

01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:58.480
Fairly sexy.

01:22:58.480 --> 01:22:59.480
I had it on my phone.

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:00.480
A quote from...

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.480
You'll probably get copyrighted.

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.480
Yeah, right.

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:03.480
I know.

01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:05.840
Ubuntu's bear gnome is up there by Kawasaki.

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:08.120
Oh, I'm hungry all of a sudden.

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:09.120
Didn't I have lunch?

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.120
I did have lunch.

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:11.120
What the hell's up with that?

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:12.120
The giant gnome...

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.120
You've been podcasted, man.

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:14.120
Yeah, I worked up an appetite.

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.120
Woo.

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.120
Alexa.

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:19.320
Appetite for a nap.

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:20.320
Turn on JB1.

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:29.680
Get those lights going for you.

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:30.680
That was a good...

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:31.680
That was really well done.

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:32.680
Now that's really stuck in my head.

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:36.000
What do you think of Ubuntu's bear gnome?

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000
It's not bad.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Yeah?

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000
You don't love it?

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Yeah?

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.000
I don't know how I feel about it.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I don't hate it.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I bet the people seem to like it.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.960
Gnomeo gnomeo.

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:55.920
I thought as far as echo commands go, I think that echo one's safe because probably nobody

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:57.480
else has any devices called JB1.

01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:58.480
Yes.

01:23:58.480 --> 01:23:59.480
That seems pretty easy.

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:00.480
Yeah.

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:01.480
I also like these.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:04.120
Are we gonna have to get to the point where all your commands are random strings?

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.120
These are.

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:09.960
I call these Shatner's hair lights just because there's so many lights in here that Alexa...

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:10.960
Cancel.

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:11.960
Cancel.

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:15.120
Starts to get confused and mixes...

01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:16.120
Cancel.

01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:17.120
Stop.

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.120
Shut up.

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.120
Shut up.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.120
There we go.

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.120
She wants to be with you.

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.800
So she gets confused because they all have light in the name.

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:26.200
So you gotta come up with these totally diverse names.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:31.360
So I got flow lights and I got hair lights and ambient lights and accent lights and...

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.360
Yeah.

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:34.240
So you should just like...

01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:38.000
Have you tried, Alexa, what is a Whopper?

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I know, actually.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.720
I haven't tried that.

01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.440
Alexa, what is a Whopper?

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:49.480
It's a signature hamburger sold by the international fast food restaurant, chain Burger King and

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:53.480
its Australian franchise, Hungry Jack's.

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:54.480
I want to be some Hungry Jack's.

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:57.400
I didn't know they had a Hungry Jack's subsidiary.

01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:58.400
I didn't know that.

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:02.040
It's really too bad when Hungry Jack is not nearly as...

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.160
I'd rather be the Burger King, personally.

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.480
The OK Google thing.

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:08.480
I'm amazed at how well that works.

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:14.080
My phone was completely across the room and that TV was able to trigger my phone.

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.080
I was...

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:18.640
Actually, so Google says they put out a command to stop it, but what it really does is it

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:22.960
still recognizes the trigger word and it still bleeps at you and then it just immediately

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:23.960
cancels.

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.840
But it still triggers your phone and wakes it up.

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:26.840
Interesting.

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:27.840
So it's still annoying.

01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:28.840
Yeah.

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:32.840
You know what's actually kind of genius in the mad genius way of trolling where Burger

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:36.160
King was like, we know Google is going to break this.

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:39.600
Yeah, that was next level marketing, actually.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.800
I don't think it was a flop at all.

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.800
I think it was actually brilliant.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:44.800
And here we are like a week or two weeks later still talking about it.

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:48.600
It's even better because they knew that Google was going to break it and then they did the

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:56.600
same type of thing on TV marketing, TV commercials, and it was a different phrase so that when

01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:12.400
Google broke the previous phrase, the next one would still work.
