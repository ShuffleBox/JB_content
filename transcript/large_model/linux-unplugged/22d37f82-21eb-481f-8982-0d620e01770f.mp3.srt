1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,300
So, how's mr. Hartley doing not bad not bad yourself

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,100
Yeah, I feel like we I feel like we circle each other all the time, but we never actually I mean

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,100
We directly interact on Facebook every once in a while

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,180
Yeah, it does seem like that doesn't like that. I'll be popping in for a bit tomorrow

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,900
So I heard I see you then I heard for this for for for secret project 109

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,620
Alpha dog

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,420
That'd be kind of cool if everyone had call signs

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,020
Right that would just make life a lot simpler. I think

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,740
I don't know then you could really would yeah, I guess we kind of do though. That's what screen names are for right

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,660
I guess so I mean it kind of starts with whole you know

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,940
You know you got your CV handles, and they're kind of a ball. I'll see you from there, and we call Colonel Linux

12
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,140
Yeah, there you go. What am I getting am I getting made fun of I feel like I'm getting made fun of

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,180
I'm basically I am just a little bit

14
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,420
Like military this is a this is a poor week for you guys to make fun of me because right now

15
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,900
I'm sitting in front of mumble, and I have a feeling this account is rather empowered

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,220
I feel like you walk around in a constant state of

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,980
Evaluating other operating systems as they compare to a bun to and all of their phone mobile operating systems as they compare to a bun

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,580
to touch

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,580
Not all the time in your spare time

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,300
Well when I'm awake yeah

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:22,820
No one's on the nook no one's on the nook no on the nook actually and a yoga as well. Yeah, okay?

22
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:28,340
So hold on a second. I'm on a think center. I'm in a Lenovo think center. I'm on a nook. I'm on a yoga

23
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,420
It's just wow man. Yeah, it's crazy. Well. I got so many computers up in here

24
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,380
You you're in studio at the moment. I am

25
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,300
Both of you, so you've not headed off to the big jamboree yet not yet

26
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:47,940
No, that is on Friday. Yeah, oh, oh wow now you you're putting in some hours there then no it came in early

27
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:53,460
Last or late last week, so that way he could be here for the for the big switch Angela to Linux effort

28
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,020
which was

29
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,980
Is ongoing Chris you know it's ongoing

30
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,020
You know I will say for the she's reinstalled the rest in order. Yeah, I'll say no no no

31
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,620
Don't don't give it away. Don't go away. I didn't

32
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:12,220
Is this a show topic? Yeah, this is gonna be a show topic. We got it all right. I'll say we gotta save it for the show

33
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,380
But I'll just say so Noah flew in if he got here Friday

34
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,740
and

35
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:23,140
He so he basically he eventually did get to sleep Sunday after last

36
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,980
Yeah, oh there you go hours for like basically yeah, we're not no neither

37
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,020
Nor I slept much from Friday until Sunday after the Linux action show yeah

38
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,780
I think towards the end of last you could start to tell both of us. We're getting a little cranky. Yeah, hey a little

39
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,780
Night owls you well

40
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,380
If we didn't stay up all night there wasn't gonna be a show in the morning

41
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,580
So we stood about we just and it wasn't just us either. No yeah, Rekai like he every guy

42
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,660
Yeah, every guy pulling double time like no, and I went off

43
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,860
I got like a solid two three hours of sleep Noah got a solid two three hours of sleep mm-hmm

44
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,140
Rekai got zero yeah

45
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,460
We didn't get sleep you just slept during last week I slept during last while we were doing last

46
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,940
And then he woke up after last to continue working

47
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:11,420
We're gonna give him a burger eyes because you know Rekai if you're not aware can be bought in five guys burgers

48
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,860
Yeah, people have no people like I become a podcaster. How easy must that be? Yeah?

49
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,340
For a day yeah, I'm up for a day. I'm seriously this job's making me old and that's and then here

50
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,860
We're wearing ourselves out right now

51
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:31,540
Yeah, yeah, she can't here's the thing though Chris. You have to understand something use you feel the stress right from the outside

52
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,540
This is amazing

53
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,580
Nobody wants to see us roll in there and everything work on the first

54
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,980
Yeah

55
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:58,300
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that has an anchor around its net. Oh wait a minute. No, that's a Macbook

56
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,580
My name is Chris and my name is Matt. Hey there Matt guess what in studio?

57
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,780
We've got a special guest and that is Noah

58
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,700
Thanks for having me. Hey Noah. I didn't have your mic muted. I had your mic muted cuz it's like who's never he's never in studio

59
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,700
Yeah, why would he talk?

60
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,900
Hey, buddy. Well, I'm glad you're in studio. Yeah, Noah's hanging out because Linux fest Northwest is coming up in just a few days

61
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,380
And we have been slaving away for hours

62
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,180
Before the show and after the show converting my wife Angela to Linux. We have learned a lot

63
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,980
and in the process

64
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,300
We've also bought some new hardware

65
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:37,300
We will be giving you a review of the ThinkPad yoga 2 in this week's episode of Linux Unplugged

66
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,700
Oh yoga 3. Sorry yoga 3. We went all out. Oh shoot shoot and we'll also tell you about that

67
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:49,540
But um after that there's a very interesting thing going on with John Deere tractors. Yeah, I said John Deere tractors

68
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,060
But it really show. Yeah, it actually very much relates to Linux free software and free hardware

69
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,060
And it's pretty cool. It's pretty cool

70
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,860
Yeah, it actually very much relates to Linux free software and free hardware and it's picked up a lot of traction in our subreddit this

71
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,260
Week, so we're gonna talk about that as well as some

72
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:11,260
Great great follow-up since Linux action show and today like I cannot believe how much good news has come out

73
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,220
It's a huge show this week

74
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:20,780
So before we go any further we cannot we cannot take another moment without bringing in our mumble room time appropriate greetings mumble room

75
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,780
Oh

76
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,620
Handsome handsome group hello there everybody man a house

77
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,780
It is it's lovely having you here, and I'll have to tell you what I'm glad you are because we have got a great show

78
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,980
And we're gonna break it down

79
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,420
Let's start though with a little follow-up a little just stories

80
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,820
We have talked about before on your unplugged program that need a little a little attention

81
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,660
Oh, hey there

82
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,480
How you doing and that is your friends are good buddies everybody loves system D

83
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:53,820
What no not everybody and a group is doing something about it one of the most tantalizing components of system

84
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,980
D is login D

85
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,140
and it's something that you got to have if you're gonna use like say gnome 3 on Wayland and

86
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,620
It's caused some consternation in the BSD's out there and all them folks well

87
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,260
I would like to introduce to you e login D

88
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,500
What essentially this is is login D ripped out from system D?

89
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,140
And it's gonna become its own project to be a standalone version of login D

90
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:20,300
So those distributions that don't want to use system D can put this in have it be API compatible

91
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,060
It'll lay out on the file system

92
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,500
It'll integrate in with PAM so that way it'll use PAM and policy kit or a login kit or whatever

93
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,700
It is a Paul kit Paul kit

94
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,260
It'll use Paul kit so that way it works with the underlying authentication infrastructure

95
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,040
So you can get all the advantages of having login D without system D

96
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:40,860
So is this have we reached a point now where we can stop saying things like red hat has taken over

97
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,580
System D, and that's a that's a totally red hat thing and nobody will else be able to play at the party because

98
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,620
Red Hat controls the party. I mean is this not a first step of

99
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,420
Allowing other people to do things different different ways well

100
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:02,020
Breaking compartmentalize things out Matt do you in your opinion is this is this sort of proving all of the system D?

101
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:08,180
Proponents point they was saying look if system D gets big there's an API you can clone the functionality well

102
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,420
Guess what system D got big and they clone the functionality isn't that exactly what we're seeing play out here isn't

103
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,980
Isn't all the naysay and all the doom and gloom maybe turning out to be

104
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,420
Not quite accurate because look look what we're doing right here. Mm-hmm is this proof of in the pudding Matt

105
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,220
I think that the whole thing was just blown out of proportion

106
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:31,720
It's obviously people with entirely too much time on their hands that sit in their parents basements whining and complaining about whatever the point of it

107
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,440
Is is that the whole thing stupid?

108
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,000
It's this takes care of itself, and it's beginning to I mean that you know solutions are already making themselves evident

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,980
So yes an answer to the whole thing being blown out of proportion absolutely hmm

110
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,180
And I wonder if anybody anybody in the mumble room that wants to take the counter-argument you're more than welcome to

111
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,060
All right, I would like to do that. Yeah, so when it comes to to the complaining well

112
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,060
That's pretty much what we do

113
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:03,240
The complaint is what improves the quality that's my argument on that one and in service we do

114
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,220
I

115
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,720
Guess it does

116
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,540
prove the case because it shows that apparently there is enough people interested enough to

117
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,060
To the point that they will do the effort of you know cloning and just having an API compatible

118
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,160
It's good that it has the API

119
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,920
But it's still work being done because it's getting to be right and that API is unstable it changes

120
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:32,380
So exactly so it means that now there is quote-unquote duplication of efforts, right?

121
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,380
Something that we're always bitching about

122
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,820
Yeah, that's what I feel. That's what I feel well, but it does prove that

123
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,400
Okay, so and I thought nothing that and it is early days not not a lot other than this to it, but I

124
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:51,780
We the system D drama does continue on its own way all right

125
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,260
I thought this next story was particularly interesting we talked about the whole Debian

126
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:01,260
elections and all the stuff going around there and the different sort of platforms that the different candidates ran on and I don't know if

127
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,220
Anybody else caught this, but I thought it was particularly interesting that Neil McGovern. I think is his name

128
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,460
he's the one that ended up being elected as the new project lead for Debian and

129
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,140
part of his election platform and

130
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,600
You know maybe it won't be exactly this but part of his election platform was introducing PPAs from Ubuntu

131
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:25,480
Into Debian to give users of Debian an easier way to install PPAs

132
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,840
Now that there could be a lot of ways to skin that cat it might not be an exact implementation although that seems like that

133
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Would be the best

134
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,640
user adoption

135
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,920
Seems like it on the surface. Yeah, yeah

136
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
What do you think wimpy? I?

137
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,880
Think this is a great idea and and probably a bit overdue

138
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:51,240
Because with Debian sort of two-year cadence more or less. You know when it's ready

139
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:57,560
And really you've only got the back ports repositories, and then you know if you're on a server platform

140
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,880
It's a little easier because some of the big projects maintain their own repositories for things like

141
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,200
nginx and varnish and

142
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,120
Postgres and things of that nature

143
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,320
but if you're a desktop user you're kind of resorting to either sticking with what you were given or

144
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,560
Compiling stuff from source or making your own packages, so I think having

145
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,440
PPAs

146
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,280
Brings us closer to that stable base and then rolling applications on top which is terrific

147
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,560
And you you don't have any concerns you think the current PPA system is good enough that Debian you think they just take it as is

148
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,880
I've no idea if they're just going to take what Ubuntu have already created

149
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,360
Doesn't it seem like that would be the most advantageous, but maybe they couldn't because there'd be too many differences between

150
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,520
Debian and poppy

151
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,600
Isn't all the launchpad stuff open now, so they could they could potentially take all that

152
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,120
They could but it comes along with I think a significant amount of baggage

153
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,640
And it's all very well integrated into launchpad. I think they want to do something

154
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,340
akin to PPAs, but not yeah like you

155
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,080
You know going and getting launchpad and putting it on a server somewhere and saying there you go

156
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,320
There's PPAs for Debian

157
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,980
I think they just want I mean there be an archive admins know how to maintain an archive and a

158
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,880
PPA is effectively a very small archive

159
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,560
That's all it is right and it has behind it has builders

160
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,800
And so they they would probably need to put restrictions on the PPA building infrastructure in the same way that we do so that

161
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,160
PPAs only build like x86 and i386 or i686

162
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,360
And optionally arm HF and optionally power PC and so on and so on

163
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,760
Otherwise their builders are just gonna be flooded with people in the same way that ours are sometimes

164
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,560
People uploading their own random like Firefox or cute or open-office whatever packages

165
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Which take a very long time to build

166
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,720
You know they need to put restrictions in place and I think they're quite capable of doing that without using launchpad

167
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,800
So I dare Devon are we putting the carpet for the horse? You say that's not the first step. What is the first step?

168
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,560
Okay

169
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,680
So apparently what they've just set out to be doing more often and more quickly is to okay

170
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,280
So like the core few set of packages to be core handle those and things that are out of that spectrum

171
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,860
Let's not keep them around and trying to fix them as they have been doing

172
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,160
Let's drop them and let them come in again

173
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:24,200
And I think that is because they're getting they're realizing the limited resources and they have more and more traction and I'd say vol

174
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,720
And others as well coming more and more to Debian are opening

175
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:37,280
That Avenue, right? So PPS will be a next step type scenario where okay if there's too many things being dropped

176
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,000
So constantly then we need to figure out a way of you know

177
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,440
Allowing those to exist and that's where PPS fill in

178
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,520
But I think they're first streamlining the process that they already have try to have that to be a quicker process

179
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,880
For people to enter into the Debian project. Yeah, then something with you

180
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,240
Yeah, you got to build that community to create the software and package all that stuff. You got to cultivate all that

181
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,240
Okay. Can I say something here? Yeah, I

182
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:11,860
I personally like the idea because I think it would make a Debian a lot easier to use for us regular

183
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,800
Users who are not so really that much first in the Linux world

184
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,080
Yeah, I think it would I feel it feels like it would make whatever it is a PPA ripoff or not

185
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,760
I think it would encourage people to switch over to Debian from Ubuntu

186
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,280
I think if that kind of availability was I think it'd be one of the one of the things that keeps people on Ubuntu

187
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:37,320
Is that that math software available available? They might as well call PPAs Ubuntu crack really?

188
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:49,240
Like it seems to me like right now Devin is aiming for a completely different kind of user that I agree to it

189
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:57,280
I agree. Well, I I do I can see that however, Debian stable is appealing to a certain class of machine

190
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,380
I mean, there's a you know

191
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,560
there's a workstation class or a server class where Debian stable has a real place to it and

192
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,880
There's also political reasons as well

193
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,400
I suppose if you insult Debian stable and then put a whole lot of packages from PPAs

194
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,360
By some random people. It's not really

195
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:20,920
Debian stable and the reality is I think they they target drastically different. Is this going to change?

196
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,040
Well what we think of Debian is this going to change Debian a little bit? I don't know

197
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,400
Do you think you're still you know right now? No, I can tell you right now. No, yes, there's already a way to install

198
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,440
packages or build sure packages for Debian

199
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,240
Well, there's third-party files from well, you can use the build

200
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,880
Files from launchpad from PPAs to build the packages on Debian, right?

201
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah, so there's kind of a this workaround way to use PPAs on Debian. I like

202
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:58,280
I like the process q5sys producer q5sys says Debian's user repository would be called the der not a great

203
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,920
The reality is that I would put my mother on Ubuntu

204
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,200
But even if I had access to all the software and PPA I still wouldn't be I still don't think I'd feel comfortable sticking around

205
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,440
A Debian box. I mean unless I'm going to be there constantly to do stuff for yeah

206
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,440
Yeah, man

207
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,740
I've been using Ubuntu for going on three years and I just recently tried a deep

208
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,660
Debian based distro AV Linux and let me tell you it was a quite a bit difficult for me to use

209
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,560
So yeah, I like Ubuntu and Ubuntu based derivatives a lot better

210
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
but I suppose I

211
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,960
Yeah, I'm reaching to really come for a good answer to that question. So I'll grant you that Derek Devlin

212
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,400
All right, your closing thought on the zero install

213
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:51,680
So zero install is this type of package manager really that this allows you to quickly install something that is listed on a website

214
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,560
And it pretty much is able to pick up from tarballs or search your package manager

215
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,660
See what's already installed use that but installs like a different environment for that package

216
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,860
It follows you pretty much to have these foreign packages

217
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:11,340
I think that might be a way of having okay. This is an exception to my stable system and

218
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,020
It is kind of better than PPA necessarily

219
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:22,060
That's my impression and it's already working with Debbie and they are actually making efforts and it works on Windows even though

220
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:28,220
I don't know. How is that going but it is interesting project. Hmm interesting a zero install

221
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,860
I I find all of this stuff so much potential and yet still so far away

222
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,300
But I'll tell you what's here today what you can capture today in your very hands listeners

223
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:43,620
And that is our first sponsor digital ocean go over to digital ocean comm right now and check them out and use our promo code

224
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:49,980
Of absolute knowledge and power do unplugged lowercase one word Noah's got like a jillion droplets

225
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,300
I'm sure he used the promo code do you unplugged on his account?

226
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,560
Absolutely that way you got a ten dollar credits. You could try out digital ocean two months for absolute what wait what you don't know

227
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,200
It what you don't know what digital ocean is well digital ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider

228
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,100
Dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin up your own cloud server that you're gonna have root

229
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,900
Dizzle access to up in the cloud sizzle and that's right

230
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,060
They're gonna use the HTML 5 nizzles so you don't even have to have Java when you want that console

231
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:18,620
You can watch it from a post all the way up to your login screen and you get started in less than 55 seconds and pricing

232
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,220
Plan started only five dollars for one outrageous month five dollars for a month

233
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:30,100
I mean, I'm just trying to think you and I went out today to the walk. Yeah, and we spent $30 on lunch

234
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,900
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, you can barely get ice cream anymore. You go to Cold Stone. You'll spend $7 on ice cream

235
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,180
That's insane that lasts like 15 seconds nuts and so so for five dollars a month

236
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:45,420
You can get 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a frickin terabyte of transfer

237
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:50,220
Yeah, a frickin terabyte of transfer. Yeah a frickin terabyte of transfer for five dollars a month

238
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,540
It's just it's nuts and they got data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam

239
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,820
London and a brand brand new one in Germany. I'm gonna tell you about that because it's hot

240
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:04,860
It's hot and their interface speaking of hot their interface is amazing. You think gnome 3 looks good. I

241
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:11,100
Think so. Yeah, no three ain't got nothing on digital oceans interface digital oceans interface is out

242
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,140
I would if I could legally get married to digital oceans interface in the state of Washington

243
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:20,940
Yeah, I think I would consider that I mean give it five years. I first of all, I would like to have multiple marriages

244
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,540
I don't feel like I should leave my existing wife over that but I also feel like I have room for another wife

245
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,660
Yeah, if that wife is digital oceans dashboard

246
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:27,780
Yeah

247
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:34,940
Especially looking that good and at that pricing structure and and digital ocean really just like come on the perfect spouse the perfect spouse has an API

248
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:40,260
Let's admit it. We all wish our significant others had an API digital ocean. You're my significant other you've got an API

249
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:40,900
It's very straightforward

250
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:46,540
They just released the brand new version so you can replicate the functionality of their dashboard on a very very straightforward basis

251
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,080
Plus there's tons of great community apps

252
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,860
We take advantage of the API and the apps around that and if you didn't ever need to use that their dashboards gonna take care

253
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,620
Of all your problems. You got full DNS management. You can take snapshots of your servers

254
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,040
You can build servers from previous snapshots to save ton of time

255
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,400
Of course, they go tons of one-click installation

256
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,980
So you can deploy the latest and greatest software on top of your latest and greatest Linux installation

257
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:12,820
Riding on top of KVM that sits on top of Linux top of those great SSDs connected to tier one bandwidth with data centers all

258
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,220
Over the world remember how I mentioned they had a brand new data center. That's right

259
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:21,140
They got a brand new one in Germany. And what I love about this data center is it is hooked up

260
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,820
They got 40 gigabit e networking to each hypervisor

261
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:30,200
They got their fastest yet SSDs on those hypervisors and the data center sits on top of the German German commercial Internet exchange

262
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:36,880
The largest Internet exchange point worldwide by peak traffic serves Germans neighboring countries with unparalleled connectivity and speeds

263
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,960
$5 a month do one plug do one plug one word do one plug lowercase $10 credit

264
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,560
Try out your own Linux rig. They got free BSD to I don't know why you'd want that

265
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,380
They got that though. They also have core OS now

266
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:57,180
I know why you'd want that containerization with a rolling base and they have direct channel upstream to from core was that's super badass

267
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,820
That's a long-term infrastructure. That's totally worth investing some skill set and time and learning and you can get started two months

268
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,420
Absolutely free up on a production droplet where you can point people at that

269
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:10,240
You can point services at that core OS is something you should check out do it for free do one plug two months

270
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,780
Absolutely free digital ocean calm. No, have you played with core OS yet? I have not really played with

271
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,940
I have I have however played with digital ocean using

272
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,700
X2 go. Oh, yeah, man. Oh, yeah, you got next to go up there, huh? That is nice

273
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:31,340
All right, so digital ocean calm do you unplug? Thank you digital ocean for sponsoring some plug program. All right

274
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,860
So wimpy is it customary now?

275
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,380
I know this is just in your opinion

276
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:41,460
but is it customary for canonical to make up crazy random numbers in their press releases or if if

277
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:47,860
If canonical writes today we count over 25 million users and that number keeps going rapidly

278
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,300
Is that is that trustable? Is that 25 million number legit? Because that seems you know

279
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,740
Cray, I I have no idea

280
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,380
No idea where those numbers come from Popey, Popey

281
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,380
I'd say what do you think Bobby?

282
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:11,220
It's not it's not infeasible. If you look at just the digital ocean being the most popular one you think about

283
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,300
Okay, if it's most popular at least 30% of that

284
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,580
Okay, you can contact a good numbers of that. All right, and it's on the tone easy to a lot, right?

285
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,580
It's on a lot of cloud installation

286
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,940
Yeah, it's very I mean it doesn't sound too off honestly

287
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:32,140
Why do you say that that number that number 20 million was quoted from mark years ago, like

288
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,900
five years ago something like that and

289
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,620
Within the first week or so of me starting at canonical someone mentioned numbers

290
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,160
And so I asked on an internal mailing list

291
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,040
Look this 20 million number has been banded about a lot

292
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,580
Is is there an up-to-date number and now bear in mind I started at canonical three and a half years ago

293
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,460
And I asked that question and I had a conversation

294
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,180
Unfortunately internal private conversation with someone

295
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,620
Who explained where that number came from and that it?

296
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,380
Yeah, it it was as accurate as we could make it given that you know

297
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,340
It's possible for someone to install them into and be behind a firewall

298
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:16,140
And so we have no idea and pass the CD around and we have no idea of that install, right?

299
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,700
So we you know, we can't be a hundred percent accurate but based on you know, various things

300
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:28,420
You know people upgrading hits on launchpad archive hits NTP update hits or you know all kinds of stuff

301
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,580
We can make an educated guess right and that was some years ago

302
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,780
the not the trajectory the graph was going in a particular direction and

303
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:44,780
We could extrapolate forward and continue to monitor those numbers. And yeah, they're not inaccurate

304
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:51,680
But that number 20 million was some years ago and people keep asking us for an updated number and I I personally think

305
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:58,700
That the company regrets ever giving that number out because people keep on asking for an updated number

306
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:04,260
I think that might be so you think 25 million is a is a trended estimate is what you're saying

307
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:10,960
No, I personally 25 million is massively under. Ah, really? I personally think it's way higher than that

308
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,560
So I have no evidence. I can't I can't possibly corroborate that or I have enough

309
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,920
No data to to provide to back that assertion up. So you could say that with a grain of salt because I work for canonical

310
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,320
Yeah

311
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,320
but when you factor in like it's

312
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,420
One of the major use cases for for Ubuntu is the cloud deployments and in number one

313
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,800
Thing about a cloud deployment is probably behind a firewall

314
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,040
I mean like a lot of those like the number one use case for

315
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,960
Ubuntu server is generally behind a firewall is gonna be harder to count if they're all coming from one IP to check in updates

316
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,240
And whatnot, right and if a company spins up 20 30

317
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,920
100 300 we just wouldn't and then and then to make that even harder than you have like when you have when you have companies

318
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,080
That have a lot of Ubuntu machines a lot of times they do internal repos, right?

319
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,000
And that's what I that's kind of where I was thinking of at first

320
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,640
I was like wow that seems high and then I thought about it

321
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,760
I'm like man in Grand Forks alone and we're only a town of 50,000 people we have Amazon

322
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,440
They have 4,000 workstations and I know for a fact every one of them is running a bunch of desktop

323
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,240
Hmm, so you look at that and now you extrapolate that and say well if they're doing that

324
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,080
They're probably doing that at every Amazon call center

325
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,400
How many computers is that in addition to all the computers that we have at home in addition to all the computers that we have?

326
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,360
In the cloud in addition to all the computers that places like Google and you think about how cheap a VM is these days

327
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,160
Yeah, we'll just have thousands of them

328
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,400
Yeah

329
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,240
But I mean like even Google has their their workstations that they do work out some modified version of Ubuntu

330
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,920
But there's a bunch of when I say people have thousands of people like data centers. I don't mean people like us

331
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,200
There's data centers where there's could be a thousand VMs in some in one data center and maybe they're only doing a few things

332
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,280
So then that number starts to see you highly realistic if not low. What are you gonna say poppy? I

333
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,020
Think people get really hung up on the numbers and and really

334
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,800
what I

335
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,580
Part of the problem is, you know, a lot of the time developers want to see numbers to be able to yeah

336
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,800
Know that there there is a target audience. Is it worth my investment of time exactly and and I I

337
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,680
Can see why people want more accurate more accurate details, but really in the large scale of things

338
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:07,440
I'm not I'm not sure that you know having super accurate numbers about exactly how many deployments there are

339
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:07,760
I mean

340
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,040
It's good for the Apple to go on to it's great for app for Tim Cook to go on stage and say we've sold

341
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:21,320
X-million, you know iPhones or iPads or MacBook pros because there's a share price there that that you know the the market

342
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,760
They're interested in keeping the market happy. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it was a privately held. Yeah company. Yeah, we don't have any shares

343
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:34,340
Right, you're publicly traded shares. So that's not important to us to make those announcements. So it's a different kettle of fish

344
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,520
Really? Can I I wanted to ask you something that I think I'm reading the wrong way

345
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,360
and I know you're not an expert in these areas and so I'm not asking for an official canonical opinion, but I

346
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:50,080
always think of you know friends of the shows like system 76 when I when I'm seeing kind of hardware related announcements from canonical and

347
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:55,200
I want to talk about certified hardware images. And so it reads as this the Ubuntu image preload

348
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,000
This isn't this is on the same announcement. So the Ubuntu image preload will come with all the drivers

349
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,920
Integrated and maintained throughout the life cycle of the Ubuntu version

350
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,920
This is a certified image from canonical the end clients were to use a standard image from Ubuntu comm

351
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,640
It's likely that not all components will work. So here's what I'm here's what I'm taking away from this

352
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,000
This is how will Ubuntu

353
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,080
Certified images differ from the Ubuntu comm images and Ubuntu certified image offers end-users radically different experiences

354
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:27,280
Because all components within the hardware will simply work out of the box and continue to offer great performance throughout the life of the Ubuntu

355
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,360
Version canonical will ensure that any modifications that may be necessary due to security

356
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:37,560
Updates and patches are fully tested and integrated into the master image before the updates are pushed out to market

357
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,960
So this would be like an OEM image provided to Dell or somebody like that, but

358
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,240
the way I also sort of could secondarily read this is if

359
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,760
If you're buying hardware from vendors like system 76, that's that's sort of like a doc

360
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,960
That's the image they downloaded off of the website

361
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,760
We can't guarantee that but if you want to buy a certified laptop with a canonical certified image

362
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,480
That is going to be maintained by canonical

363
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:07,360
So essentially canonical is kind of going to kind of do the job system 76 has been doing where system 76 has you know?

364
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,520
Made any drivers or changes or patches needed to make Linux work

365
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:15,120
Well now canonical is kind of taking that role on but offering it to almost any hardware OEM

366
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Am I following this?

367
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,280
we've had

368
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,920
An engineering services group for years that have done this right is not new. So this we've is this

369
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,120
Why is this in this and not really?

370
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,960
Well, I think it's more that people just didn't know we did it. Okay, that's what I was trying to understand

371
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,180
It's what's been changed. I think part of this came from a

372
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,520
Conversation that was had internally about the new Dell Sputnik, right?

373
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,280
so there was a there was a conversation on Intel my list where

374
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:47,560
An engineer says yeah, what laptop should I buy and and someone says well you should buy the Dell one because you know

375
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:53,840
It works really well and there were I know you and others have reported problems with the Windows version of the Dell laptop

376
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,840
That's all pretty much done Windows version

377
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:02,820
Right, but the the Linux version is now available. Yeah, and the we helped Dell make that work, right?

378
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,160
So it wasn't Dell that did that. It was a collaboration right canonical and right

379
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,440
So someone's gonna do that and someone's gonna pay for that work

380
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,360
it kind of though, but it kind of sounds like it does kind of sound like it creates a

381
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:19,120
A difference between the vendors that have certified images and the vendors that don't that maybe right?

382
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,640
Well, someone's got to do that work. Somebody should be so there's got to be commercial relationship going on between

383
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:32,280
Dell and canonical in order to make an excellent experience for people who yeah, I don't want people to go to Dell com

384
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:38,880
Type of them to get a laptop and it arrived and so this doesn't work what I'm trying to ask though is like if I were

385
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,220
to buy a certified canonical certified Ubuntu

386
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,760
machine

387
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,680
The updates for that machine would actually be be developed by canonical not the OEM. I bought them from

388
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:58,520
Am I falling? It's it's our average. Okay, this is the canonical and they'll work together. So it depends on what the arrangement is

389
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:05,080
Right, but it's it's at the whole point of this is getting a machine out the door that that is satisfactory for

390
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:11,280
Dell's customers or whoever that OEM is and what we're saying is we'll work with you to make sure it works

391
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,720
You know, it's it's a positive thing

392
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,880
It's not you know, there's an ISO image chuck that on your machine and off you go and good luck

393
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,360
Yeah, we want we want you to have a good experience. We want your customers to have a good experience

394
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,640
We want the touchpad to work. We want the touchscreen to it

395
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,440
We want the the Wi-Fi to work and we'll help you to do that. That's that's part of the value add that we're trying to offer

396
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,600
is

397
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,600
That that's what that that press release is really all about is like, you know

398
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,480
Look at the services that we offer that actually can make the experience for your customers better. I love you poppy

399
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,640
So while we're talking about hardware, I wanted to mention the yoga 3 that we ended up picking up

400
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,560
Which we'll tell you more about here in a little bit why we just picked this up and I'm gonna hold it up

401
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,560
To the camera

402
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,900
So Noah right now is installing on the yoga 3 and

403
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,100
What's been your first impression Noah out-of-the-box compatibility with ThinkPad?

404
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,500
Yeah, I mean so why but why are we doing a USB thing?

405
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:09,020
Well, so okay that so that's just the wireless needs to get the updated drivers before it will work

406
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,940
Which I need the internet that that wireless card is really finicky

407
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:19,400
It it it the laptop is incredibly well built as you would expect from Lenovo and in true Lenovo fashion

408
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,400
To get it to boot

409
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:28,080
Instead of having to do some stupid goofy shutting UEFI off and all that other crap. There's a little button. You push a little button and

410
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,080
Now you're booting USB

411
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,080
And it disables security

412
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,160
Disables the UEFI you can do regular BIOS boot the whole nine yards

413
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,800
Yeah, but yeah, the only thing is the before I

414
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,960
Understand from from the from the Google that once the operating system is installed

415
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,960
All the updates are done. We'll have

416
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,280
Drivers support for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth right now that doesn't seem to be the case

417
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,440
So what we have is we have a wired Ethernet adapter

418
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,360
The problem is the wired Ethernet adapter keeps coming unplugged and then my down my down

419
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,420
No, you know, so thanks, but it's it's really finicky and or the cables finicky. I don't know but so

420
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,080
1080p screen version. Yeah, and

421
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:15,440
Having seen this compared to your 4k XPS. It's still really good way

422
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,640
Yeah, yeah, and then you don't have to worry about all the weird high DPI stuff. Frankly. I'd prefer this

423
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,000
Yeah, I mean I'm being honest. I well I after I saw this like gosh. I kind of want to give Angie the XPS

424
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,940
But so we're gonna tell you why we're doing the yoga over the MacBook later on in the show

425
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,720
But so right now if somebody was just coming to you and say no

426
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,920
I'm at Best Buy and I want to pick up a machine that can run Linux and I know they sell the yoga 3 at

427
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,120
Best Buy would you say go ahead and pick this? Yeah. Yeah, you know the Wi-Fi is not working. Yeah

428
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,120
Yeah, I would like to

429
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,240
I was gonna say I'd like you to ask me that question again in 20 minutes, but okay, but you work on it during the

430
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,240
Show I will and then it will

431
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,600
We'll see if you get the Wi-Fi going now if that is so that's assuming we don't knock off the the adapter now

432
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:01,360
Also now if all goes well, you'll see Angela rocking her new yoga 3 at Linux fest Northwest April 25th and 26th

433
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,540
That's this weekend. If you can't be there in person

434
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:08,680
We'll be streaming it live Saturday on Sunday JB live TV and we'd love to have you tune in to hang out in the chat room

435
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,920
We'll be taking questions when we have guests from the chat room and it should be a pretty good pretty fun experience

436
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,440
It's been fun the last couple of years at least. Are you excited? I am I'm super excited. Yeah, Matt. Are you excited?

437
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,440
Oh, definitely. I've been looking forward to it all year now Matt

438
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,440
I if there were say going to be cake at the booth

439
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,720
Would you I mean would you have like even a bite? I?

440
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,720
Can't I'm literally alright. I actually have cake here. Yeah, I'm not saying there's gonna be cake. Don't assume there's gonna be

441
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:40,760
No guys, but Matt what we'll do is we'll arrange it so if there was gonna be cake

442
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,280
You're as far away from as possible

443
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,080
So you're not tempted because all as I'm saying that there was gonna be cake

444
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,760
It's gonna be delicious cake if there was gonna be cake

445
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,260
We'll make sure that we'll put you as far away from this delicious cake as possible

446
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,960
And if you know what we'll do is maybe people just show up at the booth

447
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,000
They can eat all the cake for you if there was gonna be cake work, but the cakes probably a lot Linux fest

448
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,040
Northwest is gonna be awesome

449
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,320
We'll be doing a party on Saturday evening you can go to meetup.com slash Jupiter

450
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,800
Broadcasting and we'll have final details in the Linux fest Northwest event as that approaches, and I'm really excited

451
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,200
I'm it's all in now. Who are you picking up tonight? You're where are you going after this?

452
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,040
I don't know I have to I'll have to look up. It's I think Ellen is is tonight

453
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,240
There's people coming in all all hours of the day all different days of the week

454
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,960
So it's gonna be an ongoing process, but that's just another service. We provide you're a trooper Noah. You're a real trooper

455
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,400
I think you're a you're a what do they call it? What is it? What's like the guy that does like the?

456
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,920
I think they call you a

457
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,920
Gopher no

458
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,840
Come on come on come on

459
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,880
Alright, so let me tell you about our buddies over at Linux Academy cuz they just had a freaking great great week since we got

460
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,720
Together last year on the Linux unplugged show our Linux Academy had their big live special on the 16th

461
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,600
And man you guys it's like a serious serious thing and so I've got a little summary for you

462
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,480
But I encourage you to go over to Linux Academy comm right now in fact go to Linux Academy comm slash unplug that we get

463
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,480
our 33% unplugged discount and

464
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,520
You're gonna be impressed by this so if you don't know about Linux Academy

465
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,960
They've been a sponsor for a little while

466
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,160
They are a resource for you to go learn really some of the best technology in Linux and open source

467
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:23,240
It's built by people that are truly enthusiastic about this stuff, so they really close that 10% gap

468
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:29,320
It's not a site that does like Photoshop tutorials camera tutorials after effects tutorials broken sync tutorials

469
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:36,120
And an Apache server tutorial they only focus on the Linux in the open source stuff because that's what they eat and breathe

470
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,920
They got together with their buddies that are educators and developers, and they created the Linux Academy platform

471
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,480
There's seven plus Linux distributions

472
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,300
They get to choose from that automatically adjust the courseware to match that distribution and also make sure that the virtual machines match the courseware

473
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,200
So if you choose an Ubuntu box for the courseware then the virtual machine is a buntu box once you spin up that virtual

474
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,840
Box you get a public IP address to you get to SSH up to that bad boys you get to work from your desk

475
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,480
Maybe load up mosh or something like that so that way it's real responsive. That's how I prefer to work

476
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:07,200
My lesson in my guake terminal. It's outrageous. They have scenario based labs that way you really get hands-on with the technology

477
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:13,080
So you really know what you're doing they have everything from Linux essentials up to open stack Docker virtualization

478
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,480
But after the 16th it just they just blew it off the door

479
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,640
It's just like the door came in and smacked me in the face is like oh my gosh

480
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,880
I had to print it out look at this right here

481
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,680
I got yeah two pages and how small is that type yeah? Yeah, that's wow that's ridiculous. Yeah, I know right. That's crazy

482
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,480
That's how much stuff

483
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,040
They did so I'm just gonna read through a couple these things cuz like I'm just gonna be reading off this for a little while

484
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:38,400
It's it's it's amazing so a couple of things. It's what are you guys gonna? Love the most they have new types of in-depth courses

485
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,080
They're totally nuts

486
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,560
You'll really seriously get in depth with that technology, so you're really gonna understand it

487
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,200
But they are also like hey, you know what sometimes. There's just like small nuggets of stuff. You need to learn

488
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,400
It's not really attached to any specific courseware, so they have nuggets now

489
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,040
So when you have downtime you just want to jump in and learn something new. It's a really cool

490
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,920
It's a single how-to that allows you to walk through specific tasks. They're not really course related

491
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,440
I like about two to sixty minutes long depending on which one it is. It's brand new something. They just introduced also

492
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,280
I love love love this

493
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,760
I'll tell you about all the other things they've done

494
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,320
But I think you guys are gonna think this is pretty enough pretty neat they're announcing the Linux Academy Foundation open source grant program

495
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:20,360
They're gonna give a $5,000 grant to an open source program, which is pretty amazing pretty awesome

496
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:25,640
So they are they are truly their community members. They haven't back any open source license project can apply for this grant

497
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,600
They have an external page up shortly, so we'll tell you more about it when I learn more about it

498
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,100
They Linux Academy

499
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:36,200
This is this is the guy who this is an email I sent me so they believe in supporting open source and ensuring great projects have

500
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,480
A lasting future in the community in order to celebrate and support open source. This is the email

501
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,640
He sent to me. This is not even an ad bitch

502
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:47,760
This is what I wrote me in order to support open source the Linux Academy Foundation will be opening the applications for open source projects

503
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,660
To receive either part or all of the $5,000 grant we believe in bettering the community

504
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,260
And we are excited to have the help of the founders Club members

505
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,360
I'll tell you more about the founders Club members soon and vote on which projects will receive the grant

506
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:04,240
So you can become a member of the founders Club at Linux Academy and you can get a say in which projects will receive the grant

507
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,720
I think that's awesome Linux Academy comm slash unplugged to get our 33% discount and

508
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,560
Go up try it out. You get it applied it to all of the courseware there, and there's a ton of good stuff now Chris

509
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,520
That's only the stuff that they told you about right because here's the thing I was at dinner the other night

510
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:25,120
And we sat down and what did producer q5 sis ask he goes hey, I heard you talking about xyz Ruby

511
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,800
Yeah, Ruby. I I don't see that on their side. They got really they got Ruby courseware Python courseware

512
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
I know after Linux fest. I'm gonna have to dig into one of them

513
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,620
I just don't know which one of those things where you have they they offer so many different services and so many different courses

514
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,920
They can't even you won't be able to include all those in a sales pitch

515
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,240
You'd almost have to sign up for an account and try it for a month

516
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,120
Yeah, you know it's funny

517
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,640
That's funny

518
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,720
You say that because a lot of times like I kind of get like in a I get like in a zone of what I've been

519
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,800
Interested in and then I and I get out of my course when I realize oh wow yeah, that's right

520
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,680
They have like a ton of other stuff

521
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,400
I should mention from time to time because it's just it's one of those things where you until you go see it yourself

522
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,860
You don't really have an idea of the depth of courseware, and that's why I really like their model a lot

523
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,520
alright, so

524
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,000
Let's talk about Angela's switch to Linux and

525
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:14,960
Wow what a monstrous event this has been so we ended up deciding that Angela has a Macbook and

526
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,400
She really likes the Macbook, but she's willing to try Linux, so let's get Linux on her Macbook

527
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,560
But because her pictures and her data are so precious plus. We don't want to interrupt her workflow

528
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:30,340
We just set it up on a secondary Macbook which is actually a pretty good rig

529
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:36,720
It was a 2011 model pretty high-end 16 gigabytes of RAM 512 gigabyte Apple SSD

530
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,040
Dedicated ATI graphics with the extra memory added a high-resolution

531
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,540
Non-reflective screen core i7 processor, so this is a high-end Macbook Pro that had died. Yeah, it was dead

532
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:55,120
Yeah, it was dead and then Apple just recently said hey so those of you who have this GPU issue a couple of years

533
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:00,840
ago will replace it for free and so we took the Macbook into Apple store and we gave him the Macbook and Apple said

534
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,320
Your battery's dead. We can't test it. Well the guy did some magic

535
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,720
He hooked up to a supercharger, and he got the battery working, and he did a test

536
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,960
He said yeah your GPU failed so we went down there

537
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,120
We picked up the Macbook after they fixed it for free and he's like hey

538
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,600
I threw in a free battery for you, too

539
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:19,140
So they replaced the battery the logic board the GPU so now we essentially have a brand new Macbook that just has

540
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,640
2011 parts, but it's a new motherboard new GPU new battery, so we're like we'll use this as

541
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,080
Angela's laptop that way we don't even hurt her existing laptop

542
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:32,320
But we will prove the point that to her that she'll be able to use Linux on her Macbook and that was

543
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:40,160
The original sort of idea that we set off with about Friday night. Yeah, yeah well really we started out with that

544
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,640
Yeah, we started talking about it

545
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,760
You know early Friday

546
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,000
And then started putting these pieces into these pieces of the puzzle into action late Friday

547
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,320
And what we kept finding was there was tiny little robux

548
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,880
And you know how you write those off because as somebody who troubleshoots

549
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,960
I mean it wouldn't be any fun if it worked the first time yeah, so having a good time

550
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,320
It doesn't work, so we try something else. Yeah, I can try something else and we start we're pinging developers

551
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,520
And we're trying different we are literally talking to the developers of the distributions

552
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,860
We're trying and so and so it fast-forward 24 hours later. We have now reloaded the machine no less than three times

553
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:13,560
We now have three different and we've tried it like with OS 10 with no OS 10 with refine with no refine

554
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,320
But we wound up with three bootloaders

555
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:21,200
Refined refit and grub all three of which could get you could you could click on the right option you would get into this endless

556
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,080
Boot cycle where one would boot into the other would boot into the other boot into the other and eventually at some point

557
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,680
We decided this just this just isn't gonna work, so we decide we're going to bed. That's it. We quit

558
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:36,040
Yeah, we go to bed. I go to take a shower. I get back up and Rekai's like no man. We're gonna get this to work

559
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,920
Yeah, I'm like halfway through planning an alternative episode. Yeah, I'm like we're never gonna make it what time in the morning

560
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,840
Is this what this is about 7 a.m.. 7 a.m.. And the Linux action should goes live at 10. Yeah

561
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:49,040
Yeah, so so we have like three hours mind you it took us two hours the first time to copy all of our data

562
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,200
Yeah, we got pretty good at that because like we're figuring out exactly you know that's way to get that done

563
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:59,320
Man, I can change permissions from HFS back to to ext4 like you wouldn't believe yeah, right

564
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:06,420
Yeah, so so so we're getting this that we're in the stuff that and the frustrating thing apart part about it is the computer

565
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,880
That we're working on is actually really decent hardware

566
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,880
Yeah, I I don't think there's anyone

567
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,080
Involved in JB that hates Apple as much as I do and I have to admit

568
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,660
That's a nice machine every time we look at it. Yeah, we look at it. We're like

569
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:21,500
Yeah, and when we could get things to work they work they actually work pretty well

570
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:27,340
But it's when you have a new Linux user and I have dealt with this numerous times. It has to work the first time

571
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,340
Yeah, you don't have right

572
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:36,760
We have all these little nuances from the production standpoint that like other people like maybe we just write off like we have to have

573
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:41,460
HDMI mirroring because we have to show the audience Angela's computer exactly so if we don't get aged up

574
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,540
So then that sends us down the path of okay

575
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:49,020
That means we now have to get the ATI dedicated graphics working and then this sends us down to all these different modes

576
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:54,220
We have to pass the grub menu or we have to put in grub in grub configs that way or type it in at the grub

577
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:59,620
Menu at boot so that way the ATI car gets activated over the Intel card all these little you can only boot in UEFI

578
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,900
We can't use the BIOS part and it's like if you know what I was thinking to myself this time

579
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,340
It's like man, you know if this was my rig, I would totally be willing to tinker with this stuff

580
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:12,660
Mm-hmm, but this is like I don't want to blow this. I really really really don't want to opportunity

581
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:18,260
It seriously is I've said it before but like there a crack has opened in the Apple ecosystem for us to take advantage for her

582
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,860
And her workflow and in my entire relationship with her. I've been with her for 17 years

583
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,820
I have never had an advantage like this and I'm like

584
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:29,020
This is our moment two advantages because the other thing was when she sat down and saw

585
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,500
Antrigos for the first time that blew her away. She liked it. And then it was a double punch

586
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,140
She got hit with triple punch. She got hit with an awesome hardware awesome software

587
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:42,580
And then the chat room did a bang-up job of saying hey, hey, that's cool that she's using hardcore Linux

588
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:46,740
Yeah, and she got into that. Yeah, she's like, hey, they think I'm there. Yeah, they're really proud of me

589
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:52,020
I'm using real Linux and yeah now now anything else like a bunch of elementary OS is is kind of out of the

590
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:55,020
Picture we have to do and Tegra so we have to do it, right?

591
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:59,460
So we were starting to think you know, the problem is is a there are a few things that are finicky

592
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,780
Like we're still having a problems with dual display

593
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:05,260
Which is a critical part of her workflow for like spreadsheet stuff that she's working on

594
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:10,060
We're still having issues with the dedicated graphics. We can get Intel graphics working, but we're right now

595
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:15,380
I'm not sure we're at with the ATI graphics and so no one I've been going back and forth like we really really really don't

596
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:19,580
Want to mess this up and we don't want her to have any troubles with this and if she ever does have troubles

597
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,060
We want to be able to bounce back immediately

598
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,620
So that way we don't want her to think boy something ever goes wrong

599
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:26,500
I'm out for a couple of days then she's gonna be petrified the entire time

600
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,380
I know how she works that'll scare the crap out of scare the crap out of me

601
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:34,680
So we decided to sort of preemptively grab this yoga 3 laptop

602
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:38,560
Hoping that it might work out as a little bit more of a stable machine

603
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,380
But still meet those sort of build requirements that she has the expectation she has from her MacBook

604
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:49,240
And and have the keyboard and all that that she expects from her MacBook and though and the weight and portability in fact this thing

605
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:56,100
Is thinner than the new Mac just a MacBook that they keep touting and it was funny because Lenovo actually sent out a tweet

606
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:00,240
That said oh, yeah, and then they gave the actual dimensions are like real cool Apple

607
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,420
That was so last year

608
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,660
This is also one of the number one recommended laptops from our audience now

609
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:09,340
The thing is is right now. We are not in a position to do this especially with Linux fest coming here

610
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,740
We're totally not in a position to do this

611
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,220
Well, we are out of funds before Linux fest started so what we're thinking of doing and it's up

612
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,160
Do you guys are welcome to have a first crack at it?

613
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:22,220
We're gonna put Angela's Ted the MacBook we've been talking about up on eBay and see if people want it now

614
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,180
Because we have it here in studio

615
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:27,620
You can have it however you like if you'd like to have it with just OS 10

616
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:32,080
We can load it that way if you'd like to have it with OS 10 and arch or anti gross

617
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,640
We can do it that way if you'd like arch only we can also do that and

618
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,880
Ship it to you that way right straight from the jb1 studio now

619
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,080
It's gonna get better Chris because we're not we're actually offering it at a lower price

620
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,900
So we had a price point in our head and we started a little bit lower for the mumble

621
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,440
So if you're in the mumble room, then you get kind of first crack at a slightly reduced cost

622
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,920
Yeah before we're gonna crank it back

623
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,960
Yeah, the price of that of the 512 drive when that was new alone was $1,000 in that laptop Wow. Yeah, man

624
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,240
We've come a long way. Yeah

625
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:07,220
Yeah, I really have and so the in the picture here. You're seeing if you're watching the video version. That's the Macbook. They're running

626
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,120
anti-gross with gnome 3 and

627
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,400
the gnome to shell dock extension there at the bottom and

628
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,360
That's there in the other room and it it it's a good machine

629
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,560
Like if we had the money I would just keep this as another production machine when you keep looking over it and you go man

630
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,320
Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's a nice-looking machine

631
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:31,160
It really was like it was a really all-out like our main like workhorse editing machine when the GPU died

632
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,880
And then like once the GPU died

633
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,440
It just sat on the shelf and never got used and then Apple just refurbished it basically for us

634
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,080
I would I could put it to work if I had the funds. Yeah, but I you know

635
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,360
We need to recoup the cost of this. Yeah, we just right now especially there's no money

636
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:48,920
There's no slush there and if we're gonna really be serious and want her to stick with something for a long time

637
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,040
Angela is a savvy enough user that she wants to feel that it's a quality product

638
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:58,080
She really needs to feel like this is you know, like she likes the build of the MacBook

639
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,760
I think this is gonna do that. Absolutely. It's in fact, there are a lot of things

640
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,420
I like it actually better about the MacBook one

641
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,600
It's not a MacBook and two doesn't have an Apple logo on it and three

642
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,220
It's a little bit thinner a little bit more portable. I think

643
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,480
Than the MacBook and I've had experience now that said though

644
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,520
Yeah, I mean what we're gonna put this in the show notes and it's in the chat room right now

645
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:21,960
I I am not an advocate of Linux on a MacBook as your primary unless you're okay with some tinkering

646
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,320
Yeah, what we were what we were kind of coming to is set it up and then DD the machine

647
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,240
Yeah, and that could that could certainly work too. Yep, but if you're a geek

648
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,640
I don't think this is necessarily gonna be a problem for you

649
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:38,960
If you are if you are if you are somebody that wants to set this up for somebody else and you want them to kind of

650
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,720
Run with it independently. That's where we have some real concerns

651
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,680
It's it's a 2011

652
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,680
and so it sort of sits in that spot where

653
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,960
Like enter gross you get it going pretty easily and then it takes about 15 20 minutes of tweaks and then if you really want

654
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,920
to dial it in it's about a little bit more than that once you get the graphics and all that so it's it's an interesting device and

655
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,040
It's available there and we'll let you know at Linux fest how it all turns out

656
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,360
We did decide to go with anti gross again on the yoga wimpy was asking. What do you think wimpy? Are we crazy?

657
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,640
Yes, I've made a catastrophic error of judgment

658
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:17,520
Well, I've I've made this mistake with my wife I installed Arch Linux on my wife

659
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,520
computer with gnome 3 and

660
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,600
The only way I could keep her on a Linux based operating system was to make my own damn

661
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:31,720
Distribution so you've no idea the heartache and effort you're gonna be

662
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,640
Here's what I'm working off of wimpy and tell me tell me where I felt tell me where this logic falls apart

663
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:44,120
So I would be right there with you if it was up to me and I was picking a Linux distribution for a new user

664
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,720
It would be stock Ubuntu and I would keep it as stock as I possibly could

665
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,600
However, there are three big factors to consider one

666
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:56,200
Angela really likes gnome and she was not only blown away by gnome, but she was impressed

667
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,360
She's used to using gnome on Chris's laptop add to that

668
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:04,040
She has tried Ubuntu in the past and it and and that that was turned down

669
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:08,240
So we're working with that second of all and this is a big thing if it's in my house

670
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,240
I want to be familiar with it because I know who has to ultimately answer for those for those problems

671
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,960
And so if we leave here with Angela running Ubuntu or elementary or any of those other

672
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,560
Distributions when she has problems and then Chris has to come home and she goes hey, honey

673
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:26,040
In addition to the lot in this and this can you fix this and then he sits down and goes man

674
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:31,080
I just followed this problem on arch. I have no idea how to do it on XYZ. So there's that aspect to consider

675
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,840
so

676
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:39,280
Here's the thing. So I I went through I went through a period where I had all of my immediate family

677
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:45,880
That were running Linux running arch Linux and you know, I am an arch Linux to you

678
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,680
I'm heavily invested in the arch Linux community, right, but it did not go well

679
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,960
This is not an operating system you install on your immediate family's computer

680
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:03,320
Yeah are not Linux savvy because what do you do about updates? You're responsible for doing those updates now, but is that about you it?

681
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,800
Is that he maintains control over when those updates?

682
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:14,320
Chris are you busy? I am I am but I see my logic is I have I have like three or four other machines

683
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:19,360
I would do updates on before I do hers. So she should be the last machine. I have I had I had the exact same logic

684
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:27,040
This just doesn't work you're just not gonna get around to that machine and what happens is months go by and then you think damn it

685
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:32,760
I really need to do the updates and then you've got all of those configuration conflicts to deal with and suddenly

686
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:39,760
what should be a simple task is a mess that you need to un-pickle and you don't have time to deal with it and

687
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,920
There's a slight thing that you haven't paid attention to there is Rekai

688
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,520
Well, okay, that's he has nothing to do

689
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:57,100
But what I think who is it in the chat room is is is saying the same thing that I'm thinking kz6

690
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,480
Fiddy sent

691
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,480
Um

692
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,040
Ubuntu gnome

693
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,560
Angela is not Chris. Angela doesn't know what the what she's missing by running

694
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,200
Ubuntu gnome

695
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,400
314 versus Ubuntu gnome

696
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,200
360 Chris you might appreciate those differences

697
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:22,200
But Angela won't and if you went with that with all of the automatic

698
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:27,280
You know update utilities that that's got built into it. You can just let her

699
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:33,800
accept the update prompts and hit you know apply now we start my computer I mean

700
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,760
That makes the most sense to me for up to ten machines by far use landscape and you could remotely

701
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,520
My wife I would say

702
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,840
I don't know. I mean, I don't want to I don't want to totally discredit Angela's ability your wife runs arch

703
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:59,240
She does and she installed it herself and she knows probably less about is that can I say that on air?

704
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,000
Am I gonna get in trouble? Hold on think yeah

705
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,920
She I think she knows less about Linux and technology than Angela does and she was able to follow the wiki and figure it out

706
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,080
I don't a I mean, I don't know. I I'm always for

707
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,720
What man what RIP? No, everyone's saying RIP. No, no, it's it's one of those things where I

708
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,520
I organically I agree that that stock a bunch who is usually gonna be better for users

709
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,480
but in this particular case having seen Angela's immediate reaction and

710
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,040
having seen

711
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,160
How how she how she reacts to when she's using Chris's computer

712
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,440
I think in this particular case since everyone is kind of in that arch mode and you know

713
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,600
You know who does this Linus Torvalds himself does this he uses Fedora

714
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,920
And so he makes sure that all of his other computers in his house are using Fedora and he specifically said that's because he doesn't

715
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,540
Like to run multiple distributions in his house. Yeah

716
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,800
That's even why I put it on my server

717
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,480
I can totally get behind that

718
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,040
See, but I feel like all you guys are saying don't run don't run this for your wife's computer

719
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,040
We're also the same guys that tell me don't run it on my server

720
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:04,920
Yeah, no, no, that's not me at all. I'm just the guy that says yeah, I mean you are but you're scaring me the most

721
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,220
Nine months in it's easier to maintain a whole distribution than look after one

722
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:16,300
Of its information on your wife's computer. Yeah

723
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,020
I'd have to agree with you this time wimpy because you know

724
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:24,060
There is a lot of kernel tweaks that go into the Ubuntu kernel which kind of help a little bit of the hardware

725
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,700
So but here's where I get to if I'm gonna go with an Ubuntu base

726
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,860
Then I start getting pulled towards elementary and I love Matei, but I start thinking well

727
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,580
Then I should give her something that'll really give her a you know

728
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:39,500
Sort of a sex appeal that sort of she's used to you was you were saying that Angela likes the gnome desktop

729
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:45,620
So why don't you go with that been to canine? Yeah, we were talking about all the advantages of PPAs earlier on in the show

730
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:54,740
What could it kind of come down to either elementary OS or Ubuntu Matei 1504 well, let's be clear

731
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:57,260
It wasn't so much gnome specifically that drew her to it

732
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:02,300
It was the fact that she was using the same hardcore Linux that you were using when you install a bunch

733
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:05,260
You know that then that changes. Well, yeah, it's not the same thing

734
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:09,940
Mm-hmm. So I wonder if the appeal for her is gonna change and that brings us back to elementary. I

735
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,540
Guess if you I'm sorry good

736
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:17,300
Oh, I was gonna say I guess if you mirror and like if you have if you keep frequent mirrors of everything to where she's done

737
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:22,060
It's like everything's it goes to crap. You just push a button it all reverts back to what it was five minutes ago

738
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:25,620
It's fine. Whatever. I mean if you if you have a push button solution for it, it makes sense

739
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:27,620
But I don't I just don't

740
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:32,380
Advantage of I just don't get I think you're right. I think what we do is we let Angela pick

741
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:35,820
Do you want arch or you want to bat a 1504 and here when here's the other thing?

742
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:39,820
the nice thing about this over over the old silver sliver is

743
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:45,180
With this when she changes her mind, it's a matter of plugging in a different USB drive and restart

744
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,900
Yeah, you know, it's no longer a weekend project. Yeah. All right

745
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,980
So we'll we'll we'll make her a pitch and we'll let her make the choice

746
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:55,540
And see what she thinks is best

747
00:53:55,540 --> 00:54:00,520
I wouldn't be surprised if she goes with arch and then we'll load the yoga either way she chooses

748
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:05,020
Well, and make sure you're using a laser pointer and PowerPoint slides because that really will help get your point across

749
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,860
Yeah

750
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:16,260
A lot of users don't ever realize or notice the underlying operating system very much. It's always the desktop experience. Mm-hmm. Yep

751
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,540
Always I agree. I agree

752
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,800
I just want to make sure it's one that she'll like

753
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:26,860
And I think we'll find it and we'll let you guys know and so that the bay auction is up now and don't worry

754
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:30,580
It's going so fast because I'm not I don't think we've had it. We had zero bids. It's your bids

755
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:33,260
Yeah, no, that's that's kind of won't stay that way for long

756
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:39,820
No, you think and as someone at eBay is frequently it watch for the snipers. So you'll see I said the same thing

757
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,060
Well, I'll tell you about another great deal

758
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:46,740
How about our friends over at ting go to linux.ting.com that'll get $25 off your first device or

759
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:52,420
$25 of credit if you have a ting compatible device and you probably do plus it supports this show

760
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:54,740
Things got a GSM and CD main network coverage

761
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:59,500
So when I say you probably have a device that works you probably do there's a lot of them ting is mobile that makes sense

762
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,560
Ting's my mobile service provider ting's Matt's mobile service provider ting is Noah's mobile service provider

763
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,560
We all use ting and we all love it ting

764
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,860
Not do you have you both phones with you right now just the way I have one it's in the car

765
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:11,620
Yeah, the other ones in the car. Yeah, you know why cuz it's so small. I forget it everywhere

766
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:12,460
Well, and it's why not?

767
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:17,340
I mean, it's yeah, you said Noah got one of those nine dollar GSM car a SIM cards from ting

768
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,500
And then he just pays for what he used

769
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,980
He just takes your minutes and messages megabytes and they add them all up whatever bucket he falls into that's what he pays

770
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:27,180
It's a flat six dollars for the line so we can have an emergency phone with a nine dollar SIM

771
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:32,260
Sitting in this car that has two weeks of battery life and he's just paying for what he uses which is not very much

772
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:36,460
That's why Jupiter broadcasting is able to have three lines because I don't have a lot of money

773
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,460
But I ting well

774
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:42,140
We just pay for what we use and we make a ton of Wi-Fi calls and they have some great devices on ting

775
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:45,100
I'd like to recommend the Moto G if you're looking for a value device

776
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:52,080
Ninety one dollars unlocked modern version of Android you own it six dollars for the line. No contract

777
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:56,860
That's pretty sweet. Yeah. Now. It does get a little more crazy after that

778
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:02,180
Ting has just started directly selling the one plus one. I think that's pretty awesome

779
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:06,100
Yeah, you can now buy the ting want you from ting you can get the one plus

780
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:12,580
Unlocked get it on ting. It's yours. You own it. What a great device. What a great device for a ting network

781
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:18,380
What a perfect device for the ting network and then also if you're like me and you've been looking at that Moto X to

782
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:21,660
Second-gen ting is now selling that directly as well unlocked you own it

783
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,780
That's your rig

784
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:26,260
Go take it on the ting network or if you have a GSM or CDMA device that works with them

785
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:30,060
You get $25 a service card that might pay for more than your first month. It did for mine

786
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:33,900
Yeah a smartphone for under $25 a month. It is actually possible

787
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:41,360
Linux dot ting comm they got no hold customer service a fantastic dashboard and I really really love the way they do business

788
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:45,780
Check them out Linux that ting comm and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring the Linux unplugged

789
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:51,900
I said did you see this story about the John Deere tractors or stuff and the software and I got it

790
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,940
I'll just recap this for all of you who may be not following the story

791
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:57,380
It's it sort of lit up in our subreddit today

792
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:03,140
But the headline from wired reads we can't let John Deere destroy the very idea of ownership

793
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,140
That's pretty bold. Yeah

794
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:13,900
In a particular spectacular display of corporate delusion John Deere the world's largest architectural machinery maker told the copyright office

795
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:18,220
That farmers don't own their tractors because the computer code

796
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:24,680
Snakes through the DNA of modern tractors farmers receive what they are farmers receive an implied

797
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:30,300
License for the life of the vehicle to operate the vehicle. In other words, it's John Deere's tractor

798
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:37,660
You're just driving it several manufacturers recently submitted similar comments to the Copyright Office under an inquiry into the digital Millennium

799
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,180
Copyright Act

800
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,820
Carrie Adams a farmer hasn't been able to fix an expensive

801
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:47,020
Transplanter because he doesn't have access to the diagnostic software. He needs he isn't alone

802
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:50,820
Many farmers are opting for older computer free equipment because of this very problem

803
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:56,260
Some companies have even leveraged the DMCA to stop owners from modifying programming on those products

804
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:59,460
So you might be wondering what does copyright have to do with modifying a tractor

805
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,180
Well owners can tinker, you know, and you have homebrew hackers

806
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:08,740
They have to copy programming in order to modify it in the first place product makers don't like people messing with their stuff

807
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:13,500
So some manufacturers place DRM when you break the DRM and make a copy

808
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:19,580
You are essentially violating copyright law and that's how manufacturers can turn tinkerers into pirates

809
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,980
And even if said pirates aren't circulating illegal copies of anything

810
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:28,220
John Deere the company argues that allowing people to alter the software even for purposes of repair

811
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:35,540
Would make it possible for pirates and third-party developers and less innovative competitors to free ride off the creativity

812
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:39,660
and unique expression and ingenuity of the vehicle software and

813
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:44,660
the piece of resistance as they say piece of the resistance or sauce sauce

814
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,300
in John Deere's argument

815
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:53,740
Permitting owners to root around in the tractors programming might lead to pirating music through the vehicle's entertainment system

816
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:58,020
Oh, they're really reaching here. Okay, so there's a few things wrong with this entire

817
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,780
First of all, if someone's gonna actually decide to you know, break the DRM

818
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:06,620
They're gonna find a way to do it second of all if they're doing it for themselves because they've purchased the equipment

819
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:12,900
Congratulations, they're already a customer. Let's not piss them off and third of all pirating music. I mean the whole thing

820
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:17,260
Pirating music. I mean the whole thing. Mm-hmm. They're just completely reaching for it

821
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:23,440
I mean I watched a thing or a documentary yesterday showing how you can take most cars made out and trucks made after

822
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:29,980
1996 flash the software and wait for it run alternative fuels right now. No additional hardware

823
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:36,140
So, you know, but and but because you can't it's illegal to change that software same same basic thing. This is not a new problem

824
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,140
It's just now coming to light

825
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:44,740
Yeah value of this is negative. So you're saying Matt that people are not buying $25,000 tractors to pirate music and I

826
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:49,220
Know I just I look at this at a situation

827
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:52,820
It's obvious what they're trying to do is just lock things down and use copyright to do it

828
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:58,660
But it's a pretty scary thing when everything has software in it and it's not just so we're picking on John Deere

829
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,660
General Motors told the Copyright Office the proponents of copyright reform

830
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:08,780
Mistakenly conflate ownership of a vehicle with ownership of the underlying computer software in the vehicle ie the car you own

831
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:13,660
General in General Motors opinion you do not own the computer or the computer software in that car

832
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:16,140
But of course you need to drive the car, right? Yeah

833
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,460
Convenient, right? I got to be honest as a Linux user

834
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,980
This really kind of pisses me off. Mm-hmm

835
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:30,340
That should scare you it should scare you that it's culturally acceptable that we can sell a device that you that

836
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,620
the

837
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:37,140
Concept even 10 15 years ago of buying a computer that you didn't have administrative access to would be ridiculous

838
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:44,320
And yet we allow this now consistently with smartphones with smartphones apparently with tractors apparently with cars. We just don't think about it

839
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,540
It's not good. Yeah

840
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:55,460
Yeah, yeah, you do to make them if this is the true what how where what's their liability with errors in that software that lead

841
01:00:55,460 --> 01:01:01,580
To loss of life. I do wonder about that other automate automakers have pointed out the owners who make unsanctioned modifications

842
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:05,000
Who I like that one could alter their vehicles in bad ways

843
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:08,860
They could tweak them to go faster or change no parameters to run a foul

844
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:12,980
You know like APR tuning I could tune my engine to run faster, too

845
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:13,420
Mm-hmm

846
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:19,100
Give me a break or I could just apply more pressure to that pedal on the right and I could also go faster without

847
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:23,080
Altering the software again the arguments idiotic. It's pretty weak, isn't it?

848
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:28,600
It's just terrible GM says that locking people out helps innovation this week though. There is some good news

849
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:32,620
Senator Ron widened and a janitor Jared polis

850
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:38,860
I think is the last name will introduce the breaking down barriers innovation act of 2015 which might help improve the DMCA process

851
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:42,580
We'll see although the fair repair legislation also has some

852
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,900
Work to do. Well, we'll see where that goes. What are we gonna say right now?

853
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,780
I'm sorry didn't there was a Toyota had a problem with their their gas pedal got stuck

854
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:54,420
Yeah, and it was a software issue that they had that you had to go to their dealership to get it to fix it

855
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,540
If it wasn't, you know proprietary you could actually fix it yourself

856
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:02,060
Toyota moving you forward whether you want to or not this this kind of stuff is

857
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:09,180
Particular spooky for those of us who are really hyper aware of how important software is to pretty much everything we get involved with now

858
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,420
everything we use and

859
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:16,420
It does kind of like you think RMS was right in a way. Mm-hmm

860
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:20,820
I guess it's kind of what he's been saying all along right and just saying yeah

861
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:26,140
I think and unfortunately for honor the unfortunate thing for RMS is I think it's wasted effort

862
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:28,200
Perhaps has been wasted effort because here we are anyways

863
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:32,540
so what worries me about this is not just the big devices like

864
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:37,900
Tractors that are used by farmers, but also the little devices like light bulbs, you know

865
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:42,820
The fact you have to firmware update your light bulbs or firmware update your fridge or something

866
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:48,020
And they can choose if you've if you've hacked it in some way they can choose not to let that work

867
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:53,640
And so you're left in darkness or you're left with rotting food in your fridge because they've chosen not to allow you to

868
01:02:54,260 --> 01:03:00,020
Fiddle with the stuff and yeah, I agree with you. I think RMS was right in some ways with these things

869
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:08,700
Wow, or even expanding on that imagine if they thought that you adjusted it or they thought that you made an adjustment when in reality

870
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,740
You didn't actually do anything

871
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:14,140
But because you've been labeled as such we get the same result that was just pointed out to us. Mm-hmm

872
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:19,360
That's scary dare Devlin you wanted to make comment on the sad consequences of the logic

873
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:19,980
Yeah

874
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:27,460
I think it's even worse because if you lock down and if they successfully keep locking down to in this path

875
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:34,620
What eventually will come down to only certify developers on blah blah blah, which already happens in certain fields

876
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:42,380
Yes, but it's going to expand to all of the fields like I know you have these like you have for doctors for software

877
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:45,340
Because it will be everywhere and you will have blah blah blah

878
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:49,620
Specification or certification and a lot of the innovation will be just stagnating

879
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:54,820
I mean ultimately that's what the locking down leads to hmm

880
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:59,380
If you to have access to the car you have to pass blah blah blah specification, right?

881
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:05,460
Then I mean just gonna study for that particular. You're right. That is sort of the inevitable conclusion of this logic

882
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,460
That's a great point. I hadn't thought of

883
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:11,140
WWI wanted to give you a chance to jump in on how you see this kind of happening with digital media today

884
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:19,260
It's already happening. I mean the WikiLeaks stuff that just came out from the Sony hack that right everybody

885
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:23,220
That's in this IRC and in mumble who watches text that

886
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:28,700
Knows that you know Sony had that big half and now we're seeing the

887
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:33,080
Consequences of that and what these companies are really doing behind your back

888
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:39,380
You have the evidence that anybody can go to WikiLeaks and just look it up and you can see the interaction

889
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:44,420
Between these different companies on digital media and they want to control the content

890
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:48,140
They want to control what you see on any US website now

891
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:55,460
So where's it gonna end if people should be literally up in arms about this and they're not and that's what I think it's now

892
01:04:55,460 --> 01:05:00,820
You know what they're doing and I it's of course only benefits me, but I think they're just going somewhere else

893
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:02,220
I think they're going to alternative media

894
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:05,980
I think they're going to podcasts are going to internet media and those of us that become more aware of it

895
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:07,980
we seek out independent entertainment and

896
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:12,340
I think they are going to be the catalyst of their own downfall because people will realize

897
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:15,260
Brian Williams is just the tip of the iceberg my friends

898
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:19,060
Yeah, and you can jump on you know, it's funny too when I get when I pick up a new passion your new hobby

899
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:23,780
One of the first things I'll do is I'll jump on YouTube and I'll take a look and see what other people have channels and that

900
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:27,940
They're talking about it. It's kind of fun, right? Yeah, you don't go on TV anymore for that kind of stuff. No, no

901
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:30,980
Yeah, so maybe it's actually all for the good in the long run

902
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:37,540
we'll see but it is pretty it is pretty it's pretty frustrating to watch this kind of stuff happen and I would love to see

903
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:41,940
Ron Wyden's successful with the breaking down barriers to innovation act and you of course

904
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:46,460
I will have information in the show notes and the link to wired the link

905
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:49,500
I have to wired has links where you can contact the Copyright Office and

906
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:55,580
The the URL to do that is specific for the DMC. It's dmca.digitalrights

907
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:02,620
digitalrightrepair.org dmca.digitalrightrepair.org and they have a way for you to contact people and

908
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:04,780
Representatives I'll put a link to that in the chat room, too

909
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:12,340
If you guys want to get involved with that, so maybe that can help maybe we can make a difference. Maybe good old Ron Wyden. Hmm

910
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,540
Yeah, you know, I'm probably one of those guys

911
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:19,620
It's gonna stand there on the top of my hood with both my middle fingers out going I'm doing it bite me

912
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:26,140
Because that's more how I'll be there with you. I'll bring the hot dogs. Okay, you know

913
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:34,500
The legal defense on them. Yeah, you bring the hot dogs now Matt'll bring something gluten-free you bring the beer and that'll be our protest

914
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:37,340
Actually, that sounds a little bit like Friday night, Matt

915
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:42,220
I don't know if I don't know if you have any plans Friday, but after we get set up at Ballyham and Linux for Linux Fest

921
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,700
Anything else need to cover before we get out of here?

922
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,500
Somebody buy that MacBook. Yeah, I do that

923
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:11,100
That'll help us out a lot also Linux actually show that reddit to come to make this show even better Jupiter broadcasting comm slash

924
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:22,700
Contact and Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar for updates. See you next week everybody

925
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,100
I

926
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:53,060
Think wouldn't be talking me to 1504. I will get this. Oh, really. I've maybe I don't know. I'm gonna be so much easier

927
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:54,780
I'm gonna call it that

928
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,780
Think it'd be easier really. Oh, yeah

929
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,820
Live installer thing and then all the guys at ease

930
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:05,460
But here's a sign of a broadcasting professional when you hear the outro coming up and you're like I will get everything

931
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,460
I'm about to say up before the music

932
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:09,460
So it sounds like it

933
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:12,180
Your voice elevates right

934
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:16,420
Right there I could do it's like I'm doing an auction. Yeah. All right

935
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:22,300
I'm using 1504. No free at the moment and it's awesome

936
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,500
It's wonderful

937
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:31,260
Really really really really fast really reliable. I haven't had one single problem on it

938
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:35,740
I've got a 4 gig laptop with Intel onboard graphics card

939
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:41,340
Nothing special and it just runs it perfectly. What's the support? Is it nine months for 1504?

940
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:45,020
Yes

941
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,580
Everything

942
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:50,460
What do you dislike

943
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:58,500
Stable nonsense no nonsense LTS Chris really

944
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:00,500
Yeah

945
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,500
So so

946
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:08,540
Chris so boring you guys the Ubuntu gnome team maintain their own

947
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:14,700
PPAs with the updated version of the desktop in there so you can install the LTS

948
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:21,860
you can add the PPAs for the desktop and the other applications that are important to you and you can just maintain a

949
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:25,380
semi rolling applications on top of a standard base

950
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:31,700
Try when I said to you are you busy Chris the the the extension of that question is

951
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:34,100
When are you?

952
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:40,140
When do you have free time? I know they Angela's computer when she is not using it. All right

953
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,060
You don't you use landscape

954
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:51,300
You on your machine you log into landscape and you press a button that says update all my computers and it just does it and

955
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,300
You don't worry. Yeah

956
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:58,980
Definitely what we're talking about here is potentially Chris having one Ubuntu machine on home network

957
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:02,420
Yeah, not not ten Ubuntu machines on the home. All right. Well, so now I'm wondering

958
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:05,620
To my add it to my account and I'll update

959
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:14,020
So is it really better to go Ubuntu 1404 with gnome 3 PPAs or Matei

960
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:16,700
1404 what do you think she'd like better?

961
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,300
probably

962
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:24,180
Okay, yeah, it's what she was why don't you ask her and would you try them both and see if I

963
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:31,740
That's where everyone with that Mac like interface so you can share with that

964
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:38,140
That's where everyone kind of falls off because we this has to get done like by the end of today so that she can try it

965
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,940
So they're gonna get back on. Yeah. Yeah, we're swapping her out like this

966
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:45,900
We want to get her back because you realize every day that we every day that we she doesn't have her new computer is one

967
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:50,540
More day that we have to go collect all the data off of her her existing computer. I'll move it all over

968
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:53,300
There is no doing this twice. We need to get it right the first time

969
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:59,340
Three times ago, right? Well, we're we're stopping to redo it, right?

970
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:03,560
We just don't want to go this arch kind of screwed up your plans doesn't mean you

971
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,020
That is arch have anything to do with the plans

972
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:11,620
In fact, if anything arch has been the easiest distribution out of all of them to get running on there

973
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:14,540
We couldn't get a bunch of we couldn't get a bunch of the boot

974
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:19,460
We couldn't get what else do we try and then no, it's not like it's some arch maniac

975
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:24,940
No, in fact, I really dislike arch in this particular case. He's right. It's the only one that even booted on the system much less

976
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:31,860
Let's look at this. Okay, so we've established that arch is working a boon to at some level wasn't really working out

977
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:34,060
Previous at all at all. So

978
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:40,240
Even though I'm not an arch guy anymore necessarily that kind of gravitates us just just sticking what's what's working

979
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:44,680
I think well, but now run but now it doesn't matter cuz now we're on the yoga, you know, so now well, okay

980
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,700
So now we could oh, you know, I see what you're saying. I see you say, okay

981
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:50,960
So the based on that stick with gnome a boon to gnome done, you know

982
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,100
She's already grown to like the desktop environment make keep it simple

983
01:11:54,220 --> 01:12:00,180
You know, you're rarely I rarely ever recommend you bugged you but here I am doing it

984
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:03,180
I feel like I feel like we recommend a boon to because we're all scared

985
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:07,540
I feel like we do it because we're scared of we are scared of rolling

986
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:12,020
Software it's a practical. It is a practical scared thing because it's bitten me enough times

987
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:19,860
No, I just hate giving in so let's say you have you have arch like it's just a flood of perfectly flawless updates

988
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:26,460
I'm saying that without laughing and or you have a book because I've broken shit so many times or you have a boon to

989
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:32,580
Which you know can still have issues obviously, you know, I'm both both options can roll back their packages just fine easy enough

990
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:34,740
No big deal. Yeah, but I have less

991
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:38,500
Wonderful updates of one than I do the other I guess for her

992
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:42,660
I get

993
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:45,860
Yeah, all right. All right, JB titles.com. Let's get this thing banged out

994
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:50,300
Yeah, so I mean it's so from owner. What's that? I

995
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:53,860
Said five minutes. I got a puppy on there. That's all you guys

996
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:55,940
Oh

997
01:12:55,940 --> 01:13:01,180
Dear RMS was right. It's not bad. That's excellent. Actually Chris. Does she not like unity at all?

998
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:03,940
No, she does not know

999
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:10,700
But once you depart from Ubuntu, I almost say it at the risk you get my head bit of I almost say elementary

1000
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:14,620
You know guys, he doesn't like unity because he has choice

1001
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:18,860
Elementary has a lot of USB stick. Yeah

1002
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:23,340
Issues I've had a lot of issues

1003
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,700
A lot of issues with their

1004
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:35,700
I agree, but it's not an issue in elementary. I think the US is a little bit too far removed from the parent project

1005
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:41,780
Well to be honest, I mean I would be I would probably be more willing to go with it, but it's in beta fray is

1006
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:43,780
Yeah, that's true. So

1007
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:49,260
I thought fray I thought was a bit like the release. No final version

1008
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:56,060
Well, if you ignore the three thousand seven hundred bucks in launchpad, it's it's final release, okay

1009
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:04,060
Care about making a desktop really

1010
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:09,620
All the applications that Angela probably need isn't part of elementary's vision

1011
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:14,620
So they don't care about anything else other than their Pantheon and no blessed application

1012
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:17,940
Well, no, she needs the web browser. She needs photo and she needs mail and they do all that

1013
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:19,940
But yeah, yeah. Well, all right

1014
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,500
I think right now

1015
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:38,820
Someone rely on that I think either way I think either way we go it's gonna be okay. So I'm not

1016
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:43,820
About it go safe go safe with a bun with a bun too long lean initially

1017
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:49,940
And then if you want to go to watch or something that once she she's been on it a little bit longer and got used

1018
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:51,940
To it then then go for it then

1019
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:57,980
Here's the end of the thing is like let me paint you a picture. You've got two three week circumstances three weeks from now

1020
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:02,780
You're like, oh crap. I haven't updated that for a while. Which distro do you want to be faced with what doing that?

1021
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,820
So I'll let you guys know which way we go

1022
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:12,340
I will we'll get the installation going here in a few minutes now once we get off air and we'll update you guys soon

1023
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:36,180
Have a great week, and I'll see you tomorrow minute. All right. I'll see you then. All right, buddy
