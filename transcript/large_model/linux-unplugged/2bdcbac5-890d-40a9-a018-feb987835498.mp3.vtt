00:00.000 --> 00:07.400
Will you describe to Angela sort of your approach to taking some of the excess revenue generated

00:07.400 --> 00:11.880
for the Buntu Mate project and how you pass it on to some other open source projects?

00:11.880 --> 00:14.000
Because I don't think she's heard that before.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
Okay.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.760
So we receive donations from our awesome community and users and we've got far more money coming

00:22.760 --> 00:26.280
in than we need to cover the costs of the project.

00:26.280 --> 00:32.160
So when there's a surplus, we identify other open source projects that we depend on or

00:32.160 --> 00:39.480
are making use of, and we send some of those donations back to those projects.

00:39.480 --> 00:45.040
And that hopefully keeps them motivated and keeps them covering their costs.

00:45.040 --> 00:51.920
And it helps generate some collaboration and contact and communication with the various

00:51.920 --> 00:54.560
projects that we reach out to in that way.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.440
That's good PR for his project too.

00:56.440 --> 01:03.000
So you pretty much fund the projects that you're most interested in?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.100
To some extent.

01:04.100 --> 01:11.600
So this month we've given some money to TLP, which is an advanced power management utility

01:11.600 --> 01:16.640
for Linux, which is going to be integrated into the next release of Ubuntu Mate.

01:16.640 --> 01:22.560
Now I've been using that for some years and it really increases battery endurance on laptops

01:22.560 --> 01:23.560
and things.

01:23.560 --> 01:28.760
So I wanted to integrate that and it started a dialogue with that developer, but we've

01:28.760 --> 01:31.760
also sponsored other individuals and projects.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.120
It's not like loads of money.

01:33.120 --> 01:37.780
I'm not going to make anyone rich overnight or anything, but it's a nice way to recognize

01:37.780 --> 01:43.280
their contributions because as single application and utility developers, they probably don't

01:43.280 --> 01:47.560
generate much donations for their individual projects.

01:47.560 --> 01:54.840
But by using a distribution as a platform, we can be a bit more generous than you could

01:54.840 --> 01:57.600
be as an individual.

01:57.600 --> 02:02.400
We've been kicking around in house as we've transitioned more and more of our production

02:02.400 --> 02:05.080
over to Linux or open source tools.

02:05.080 --> 02:10.280
Now we start to kind of feel like we'd like to come up with a model where we can contribute

02:10.280 --> 02:15.460
some amount to the projects we depend on and maybe even help encourage them to continue

02:15.460 --> 02:21.280
to support Linux because some of those projects, their Linux support is a little tenuous.

02:21.280 --> 02:26.400
So it seems like there's a whole range of software specifically around media production

02:26.400 --> 02:30.800
that I've been sitting around and waiting for to get better for a really, really long

02:30.800 --> 02:31.800
time.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.640
And some of it's gotten a lot better and some of it still hasn't.

02:33.640 --> 02:36.480
And so I'm starting to wonder if maybe there isn't a way we could start to move the dial

02:36.480 --> 02:37.540
there a little bit.

02:37.540 --> 02:42.720
So do you just kind of personally choose where the money goes or is there a – the main

02:42.720 --> 02:45.960
thing I'm worried about is if I did something like that, I feel like it would be constant

02:45.960 --> 02:49.640
scrutiny, constantly questioning how much and where I put – sent the money.

02:49.640 --> 02:53.360
And I would like to base it on, well, I feel like this is what we can afford to do and

02:53.360 --> 02:57.980
this is how that project is important to us or to media production in general or open

02:57.980 --> 02:58.980
source in general, whatever.

02:58.980 --> 03:02.180
You know, like I feel like I'd like to have some freedom over it to sort of help encourage

03:02.180 --> 03:04.400
projects that make our content better.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.400
But I feel like it would be – it would be constantly up against scrutiny.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.600
So how have you avoided that?

03:08.600 --> 03:13.080
Well, at the moment, this is one of the few things that I've not actually gone to the

03:13.080 --> 03:17.240
Ubuntu Mate community and said, which projects do you think we should sponsor?

03:17.240 --> 03:25.960
I've actually made that decision for myself based on the projects that I feel are most

03:25.960 --> 03:31.200
important to Ubuntu Mate that aren't necessarily part of Ubuntu or Mate.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.400
So they've been quite diverse.

03:32.400 --> 03:37.400
I mean, I've actually sponsored one of the elementary projects a couple of months ago

03:37.400 --> 03:40.680
and now have good relationships there.

03:40.680 --> 03:46.240
And I've still got plenty of ideas in the pipeline about what projects I would like

03:46.240 --> 03:50.000
to support through Ubuntu Mate over the next few months.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.760
And when I start running out of ideas, then I'll start asking the community.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.040
And I think, you know, there's obvious candidates.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.960
For example, we haven't sponsored Mozilla yet.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.520
We haven't sponsored LibreOffice yet.

04:02.520 --> 04:06.720
We're not going to make any significant contribution there, but we should recognize

04:06.720 --> 04:09.880
the part that they play in making up an operating system.

04:09.880 --> 04:14.680
So, you know, they're clearly on the list and will get some recognition.

04:14.680 --> 04:20.840
But I'm sure the Ubuntu Mate community have got projects that are included in Ubuntu Mate

04:20.840 --> 04:22.280
they'd like to see receive some money.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.000
And when I start running out of ideas, I'll ask.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Okay.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
That makes sense.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
And that might be kind of an approach I would take too.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.360
I've been kicking it around for a while, trying to figure out what I'm most comfortable

04:31.360 --> 04:34.200
with and really willing to commit to.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.680
I actually think the way Martin does it is the right way to do it.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.280
He picks what he thinks is most appropriate.

04:41.280 --> 04:46.720
And I know if someone sent him an email saying, hey, Martin, I really think you should consider

04:46.720 --> 04:51.000
donating to these people, then I'm sure if it's not unreasonable, it will go on the list.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.320
But I don't think it's necessarily a good idea to put out a poll and say, who should

04:56.320 --> 04:57.640
we give the money to?

04:57.640 --> 05:03.320
Because that can cause resentment for people who were at the bottom of the list and can

05:03.320 --> 05:09.360
cause people to gain the system and try and force Martin to give money to someone he might

05:09.360 --> 05:12.840
not necessarily think is the most important or worthy recipient.

05:12.840 --> 05:13.840
Good point.

05:13.840 --> 05:19.080
Well, thank you for that vote of confidence.

05:19.080 --> 05:25.040
Well in order to find out which projects are out there, you're kind of getting a, not necessarily

05:25.040 --> 05:28.280
a polling, not to vote, but just to get the ideas.

05:28.280 --> 05:33.160
I feel like if I did one a month or something, I could probably do it for a year easily on

05:33.160 --> 05:34.160
my own.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.840
Just the ones that we depend on here for production.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.800
And I kind of feel like in some ways, like if they were commercial software projects,

05:38.800 --> 05:41.540
I would have paid for them many times over now.

05:41.540 --> 05:46.000
Like geez, how could I even put a dollar amount on FFmpeg?

05:46.000 --> 05:50.860
I don't even like, I can't even, FFmpeg is worth more than any proprietary commercial

05:50.860 --> 05:54.540
piece of software we have from Adobe or Apple.

05:54.540 --> 05:58.880
And so I just can't even fathom, or really in some ways VLC is pretty fricking important

05:58.880 --> 06:01.080
too.

06:01.080 --> 06:07.760
So it's really weird, like these open source projects couldn't do our job without them

06:07.760 --> 06:08.760
now.

06:08.760 --> 06:12.160
Now that we've, you know when we look to replace proprietary components with open source ones,

06:12.160 --> 06:15.840
when we made the switch, we made the switch because they were better choices, not just

06:15.840 --> 06:18.740
because they were the free and open choices.

06:18.740 --> 06:25.360
And so once you make that switch, it's kind of a mind F to think about how much money

06:25.360 --> 06:29.120
you'd actually be willing to spend on those things that you just get for free.

06:29.120 --> 06:34.680
I'm inclined to agree with Martin though, that if you pick out like the big ones, like

06:34.680 --> 06:40.920
Mozilla and LibreOffice and others that you've listed, there's the possibility that you would

06:40.920 --> 06:43.120
be a drop in the ocean.

06:43.120 --> 06:48.840
I mean I'm sure they're very grateful and thankful that you're showing your appreciation

06:48.840 --> 06:54.120
by giving them some hard-earned cash, but the flip side is for all the money that you

06:54.120 --> 06:58.960
give to those really big ones, there's all these unsung heroes out there creating some

06:58.960 --> 07:06.080
tiny little thing that's a tiny cog in the whole mechanism of Jupiter broadcasting that

07:06.080 --> 07:08.000
doesn't necessarily get the recognition.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.720
And I know you as a broadcaster are looking for content all the time and if you find and

07:14.720 --> 07:20.480
discover those tiny little projects and you chuck a few bucks their way and say, you know,

07:20.480 --> 07:25.440
I really appreciate the work you're doing, it may well help motivate them to continue

07:25.440 --> 07:26.440
working on it.

07:26.440 --> 07:29.880
They'll never know these tiny little projects, how much time they've gotten, whether they're

07:29.880 --> 07:32.160
happy to carry on working on the project or not.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.720
Or if they're burning out or whatever.

07:35.720 --> 07:39.560
Yeah, exactly.

07:39.560 --> 07:45.320
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that has this chat room full screen

07:45.320 --> 07:46.520
on your screen.

07:46.520 --> 07:47.560
My name is Chris.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.560
And I'm Angela.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.560
Hey there, Andrews.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.560
I'm glad to have you here.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.840
Now I'm not sweating alone.

07:51.840 --> 07:55.080
I appreciate having somebody to sweat with during the show.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.080
I may or may not have pants on right now.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.360
And you may or may not be in a tank top right now.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.460
This is the summer edition of the Jupiter Broadcasting Programming.

08:02.460 --> 08:05.080
It kind of reminds me of when we used to broadcast out of the garage.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.080
We also were affected.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.400
At least here in the studio we don't get crazy cold.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.960
We only get crazy hot.

08:09.960 --> 08:10.960
So it only goes one direction.

08:10.960 --> 08:17.320
Well coming up on today's episode of 96, holy smokes, episode 96 of the show.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.440
We got Matt coming on from the Fedora Project.

08:19.440 --> 08:23.640
Matthew Miller will be joining us talking about Fedora 22 and Fedora 23.

08:23.640 --> 08:27.440
Mark Shuttleworth was on stage today playing a can you name what it is game.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.680
Yes, Ubuntu is now running on yet another crazy device.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.200
We'll be talking about that.

08:31.200 --> 08:35.200
Angela's here to give us an update on her switch to Linux.

08:35.200 --> 08:39.600
And she's got her top four things that she's run into and solved or maybe has not solved

08:39.600 --> 08:41.280
since she's visited us last.

08:41.280 --> 08:45.460
And I'm going to say one of them straight up I think is just one of the reasons why

08:45.460 --> 08:47.000
Arch isn't super great for new users.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.280
But she doesn't mind tackling it.

08:48.280 --> 08:50.640
We'll talk about that a little bit in the show.

08:50.640 --> 08:54.240
And then at the end, if we have some time, we got some great insights into why some of

08:54.240 --> 08:57.160
us are just maniac distro hoppers.

08:57.160 --> 09:01.460
I think we might finally have the answer and we'll get some insights into all of that crazy

09:01.460 --> 09:02.760
distro hopping that we like to do.

09:02.760 --> 09:07.860
But first, but first, before we do all of that, let's say hey to our virtual log, time

09:07.860 --> 09:13.280
appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.280
Poppy is always on it.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.360
He's like, boom, right in there with it.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.360
That's nice.

09:17.360 --> 09:21.660
Okay, so I just wanted to commence with you guys, what's going on with SourceForge?

09:21.660 --> 09:26.120
So since we had a chance to get together last time, it's also come out now that the Nmap

09:26.120 --> 09:30.200
project was taken over in the same way that GIMP for Windows was.

09:30.200 --> 09:35.640
Also VLC, back in the day, like this didn't get a lot of attention, but back in the day,

09:35.640 --> 09:36.640
check this out.

09:36.640 --> 09:41.360
The founder of VLC sent an email to Ars Technica that said that the VLC project's account on

09:41.360 --> 09:45.600
SourceForge was taken over in 2012, which was the most downloaded project at the time.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.520
In fact, it's still one of the most top downloaded projects on SourceForge, even though it's

09:48.520 --> 09:50.080
not their primary hosting.

09:50.080 --> 09:54.080
They say too that when that happened, and then VLC moved to their own hosting infrastructure

09:54.080 --> 09:57.800
after that event, surprisingly those new servers were DDoSed.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.400
They don't know if it was related or not.

09:59.400 --> 10:02.480
So what's going on, Angie, if you're not familiar, SourceForge is a site that hosts a lot of

10:02.480 --> 10:05.360
open source projects, gives them mirrors for downloading.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.900
And you know, when you're writing free code, it's not like you have a bunch of extra money

10:07.900 --> 10:11.240
to have a bunch of mirrors, so this is a very handy service.

10:11.240 --> 10:15.060
And what they started doing is they take like the Windows installer for GIMP, and they'd

10:15.060 --> 10:16.560
package it up with a bunch of adware.

10:16.560 --> 10:20.340
And so when you download it, you get like the SourceForge version of GIMP that has ads

10:20.340 --> 10:23.300
and installs on your machines and all that kind of crap.

10:23.300 --> 10:26.360
And now we find out that they're doing it to other open source projects as well, like

10:26.360 --> 10:27.360
Nmap and VLC.

10:27.360 --> 10:32.680
Wait, so SourceForge is grabbing people's open source projects, packaging them, loading

10:32.680 --> 10:34.280
them, and then distributing them?

10:34.280 --> 10:36.480
Why would people even use SourceForge if they're doing that?

10:36.480 --> 10:38.080
Well, SourceForge has a lot of momentum.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.480
Is it a distribution method for open source projects?

10:40.480 --> 10:43.660
A lot of people go there to find software, a lot of old links on websites linked back

10:43.660 --> 10:44.660
to SourceForge.

10:44.660 --> 10:45.660
Do they just use GitHub?

10:45.660 --> 10:46.660
There's a lot of play.

10:46.660 --> 10:51.000
Well, GitHub's not so much for hosting the file, although people do do that as well.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.560
There's a lot of other alternatives now.

10:52.560 --> 10:53.560
It's old.

10:53.560 --> 10:54.560
That's why it's there.

10:54.560 --> 10:55.560
After parking in here.

10:55.560 --> 10:58.560
I'm not introduced to it yet.

10:58.560 --> 11:03.560
SourceForge management changed, and then they decided to screw up the old trusty SourceForge

11:03.560 --> 11:05.480
that used to be good.

11:05.480 --> 11:06.480
Yeah.

11:06.480 --> 11:11.200
There was no GitHub, and then GitHub came along and did the thing it does better than

11:11.200 --> 11:14.920
what SourceForge wanted it to be, and then everybody moved off SourceForge, and then

11:14.920 --> 11:17.360
people at SourceForge feel like they need to get a lot of money, at least that's my

11:17.360 --> 11:18.360
perspective.

11:18.360 --> 11:19.360
Yeah.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.520
I'm just making that up, but it seems...

11:21.520 --> 11:24.920
I don't need to get on the soapbox again, but what I don't like about it, and it probably

11:24.920 --> 11:30.360
seems pretty obvious to you, is it kind of, to the average consumer, gives open source

11:30.360 --> 11:31.360
projects a bad name.

11:31.360 --> 11:32.360
Yeah.

11:32.360 --> 11:37.200
If I tell you to go download VLC, and then you download... God, this is the worst case.

11:37.200 --> 11:40.200
We've had this happen with family members because they just screw it up.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.320
We'll tell them to go download VLC, and then they'll go Google VLC, and they'll download

11:43.320 --> 11:47.040
some adware version of VLC and get a ton of crap on their PC.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.040
Or bloatware, right?

11:48.040 --> 11:49.520
Isn't that what it was called?

11:49.520 --> 11:50.520
Yeah.

11:50.520 --> 11:53.200
That gives open source projects like VLC a bad name, just that kind of stuff.

11:53.200 --> 11:57.780
Now, when you go to a well-established distribution point for open source software, and they're

11:57.780 --> 12:02.280
distributing open source software that looks official with adware, it looks like it's the

12:02.280 --> 12:03.280
projects doing it.

12:03.280 --> 12:07.960
If you're sort of a casual average user, it's a huge disappointment.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.800
SourceForge is becoming another CNETsDownload.com, Elroy says, and I completely agree.

12:11.800 --> 12:12.800
Download.com did the same thing.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.800
Yeah.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.800
Let's come out with a new one.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.800
Yeah?

12:15.800 --> 12:16.800
Yeah.

12:16.800 --> 12:17.800
I don't know.

12:17.800 --> 12:18.800
What do you think, Alex?

12:18.800 --> 12:19.800
Binary downloads?

12:19.800 --> 12:20.800
Tell me more.

12:20.800 --> 12:21.800
Yes.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.400
I think SourceForge is still the best for binary downloads.

12:24.400 --> 12:33.880
There was a page that compared all our alternatives, and for binary, GitHub just doesn't cut it.

12:33.880 --> 12:34.880
Yeah.

12:34.880 --> 12:35.880
There is, actually.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.080
The mirror network is nice, too, let's be honest.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.080
Free bandwidth.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.720
You can never really sneeze at that.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.360
I posted the link.

12:43.360 --> 12:44.360
Yes.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.960
Thank you.

12:45.960 --> 12:46.960
From Rotten Corpse's blog.

12:46.960 --> 12:47.960
Yeah.

12:47.960 --> 12:48.960
That's cool.

12:48.960 --> 12:49.960
I was just going to say, yeah.

12:49.960 --> 12:50.960
All right.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.200
So, I just would like to get the audience's opinion on that.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.200
It's kind of a shame.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.720
It is kind of a shame.

12:55.720 --> 12:56.720
What is angersdownloads.com?

12:56.720 --> 12:57.720
Oh, try it.

12:57.720 --> 12:58.720
Click it.

12:58.720 --> 13:01.920
What's the worst that could happen?

13:01.920 --> 13:02.920
It's not a link.

13:02.920 --> 13:03.920
Come on.

13:03.920 --> 13:04.920
I will copy it.

13:04.920 --> 13:05.920
I want something good.

13:05.920 --> 13:06.920
Come on.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.920
Come on.

13:07.920 --> 13:08.920
I want something good here.

13:08.920 --> 13:09.920
Let's see what we get.

13:09.920 --> 13:10.920
What is it?

13:10.920 --> 13:11.920
What is it?

13:11.920 --> 13:12.920
Sir not found.

13:12.920 --> 13:13.920
I think it's wasted effort.

13:13.920 --> 13:14.920
Darn it.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.920
I thought it was a wasted effort.

13:15.920 --> 13:16.920
Darn it.

13:16.920 --> 13:17.920
Go figure.

13:17.920 --> 13:18.920
Way to get me all excited.

13:18.920 --> 13:19.920
Yeah.

13:19.920 --> 13:20.920
Well, maybe by the end of the show, you could have something there.

13:20.920 --> 13:21.920
All right.

13:21.920 --> 13:22.920
I wanted to read a bit of feedback we got into the show.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.160
It says, we're going to be talking with Matthew Miller from Fedora.

13:25.160 --> 13:26.760
This is a great bit of feedback.

13:26.760 --> 13:35.120
This was Tehamilox experience with Gnome Shell 3.16 on Wayland 1.8.

13:35.120 --> 13:38.800
Since Wayland 1.8 was just released, I've decided to give Gnome Shell on Wayland a go.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.600
I'm using an upgraded Arch.

13:40.600 --> 13:45.200
I've been impressed overall with the smoothness, like resizing and dragging windows around.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.440
However, there's still some problems that are unique to Wayland.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.880
Now, this is what we've all been wondering.

13:49.880 --> 13:53.760
What do I lose if I switch to this new display server on Linux?

13:53.760 --> 13:59.400
No copy and paste support between X-Wayland and native applications, no middle button

13:59.400 --> 14:00.400
paste.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.400
Wait.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.520
With native apps, you can't copy and paste?

14:03.520 --> 14:04.520
That seems...

14:04.520 --> 14:08.480
Well, so you have apps that know they're in Wayland, and then you have these old X-apps

14:08.480 --> 14:11.040
that are from the old display server that are running in compatibility mode.

14:11.040 --> 14:13.080
You can't paste between the new smart apps.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.080
Oh, I see.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.080
I see.

14:15.080 --> 14:19.720
So, a lot of important apps that are still running in this compatibility mode, like VLC,

14:19.720 --> 14:23.080
Chromium, even though native versions exist, they're not packaged properly.

14:23.080 --> 14:26.800
X-Wayland applications are not clickable when placed on the second monitor.

14:26.800 --> 14:30.160
Evian's PDF viewer displays every document at 400%, and you can't change that.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.760
Double click doesn't work?

14:31.760 --> 14:36.720
Okay, so as somebody that uses shortcuts on a mouse, is a middle button click a mouse

14:36.720 --> 14:37.720
thing?

14:37.720 --> 14:38.720
So, yeah.

14:38.720 --> 14:42.240
In Linux, you can highlight text, and it automatically gets copied to the X Clipboard, and if you

14:42.240 --> 14:44.480
use the middle button to click, it automatically pastes from the X Clipboard.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.120
You never have to do Control-C, Control-V, nothing.

14:46.120 --> 14:47.120
Just highlight, click.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.120
That's genius.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.120
Nice.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.240
It actually turns out, too, that they never actually, I don't think, intentionally put

14:51.240 --> 14:52.240
that feature in there.

14:52.240 --> 14:56.400
But he says, overall, he's been pretty satisfied, if you're okay with those problems.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.960
For my use case, it's not really, he says, not ready to be his daily driver, but it's

14:59.960 --> 15:01.920
pretty exciting it's gotten this far.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.480
Anybody else in the Mumble Room had a chance to play with Wayland as their main desktop

15:04.480 --> 15:05.480
for a little while?

15:05.480 --> 15:08.480
All these people didn't know about it.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.120
Well, you don't think so?

15:10.120 --> 15:11.120
No.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.120
I have it on the Yolo phone.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.120
Oh, yeah.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.120
Of course.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.120
Yes.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.920
And I'm sure it works fine in that use case, right?

15:16.920 --> 15:18.440
Yeah, quite good.

15:18.440 --> 15:19.440
Yeah.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.200
I played with it briefly when I had...

15:21.200 --> 15:22.680
I think I played with it.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.600
I think it was with the Dora 21.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.960
I think I played with it when I had it on an Intel driver machine.

15:27.960 --> 15:32.320
And for the five minutes I used it, I was pretty impressed how well it worked.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.320
Go ahead, Corky.

15:33.320 --> 15:34.320
There is one issue.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.320
Porting.

15:35.320 --> 15:41.680
Well, Nome has partial Wayland support now, but for all other desktop environments and

15:41.680 --> 15:47.640
window managers, the developers have to go through a long process of porting it.

15:47.640 --> 15:52.960
And when some of them can't even get to GTK3, it's going to be quite a hard process to get

15:52.960 --> 15:56.680
to an incomplete display server.

15:56.680 --> 15:57.680
Yeah.

15:57.680 --> 15:58.680
Yeah.

15:58.680 --> 15:59.680
That's why...

15:59.680 --> 16:00.840
Yeah, there's going to be a lot of compatibility stuff around for a long time.

16:00.840 --> 16:04.240
I'm not in a huge rush, but it is good to see it moving right along.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.240
Okay.

16:05.240 --> 16:08.960
I want to just take a minute and read another one more bit of feedback, and then we'll get

16:08.960 --> 16:10.720
to Matthew.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.240
So this one came in from KBNap.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.240
Kidnap?

16:14.240 --> 16:15.240
KBNap?

16:15.240 --> 16:16.240
What do you think, Ange?

16:16.240 --> 16:17.240
KBNap?

16:17.240 --> 16:18.240
I don't know.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.240
KBNap?

16:19.240 --> 16:20.240
I'm going to go with that.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.240
Yeah.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.240
That's great.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.240
It's called DOCLI, a command line tool for DigitalOcean.

16:23.240 --> 16:26.760
He says, I'm a longtime listener of the show, all the JV shows, and I've been using DO for

16:26.760 --> 16:28.960
quite a time thanks to Jupyter Broadcasting.

16:28.960 --> 16:34.880
So I decided to try and make DOCLI, a command line utility for Linux, and probably OS too,

16:34.880 --> 16:36.640
for managing your DigitalOcean infrastructure.

16:36.640 --> 16:37.640
Now check this out, Ange.

16:37.640 --> 16:38.640
She made this tool.

16:38.640 --> 16:39.640
Okay.

16:39.640 --> 16:40.640
Be warned.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.100
He says it's in beta and he needs testers.

16:42.100 --> 16:44.800
So if you're feeling like you want to jump in, he'd love it.

16:44.800 --> 16:45.800
You can check out...

16:45.800 --> 16:47.360
He gives the command there to check it out.

16:47.360 --> 16:52.160
And so it's like, here's an example, a command would be DOCLI dash dash verbose dash dash

16:52.160 --> 16:54.560
no send then the command.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.840
And you can do like delete command safely.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.960
You could pass commands up to the droplet.

16:58.960 --> 17:03.120
He says, it's using the DigitalOcean API wrapper library behind the scenes.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.880
And if you use Rust, feel free to give in and contribute.

17:05.880 --> 17:07.160
It's written in Rust.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.240
Keep up the great work on the last community.

17:09.240 --> 17:16.280
And he says it is in the AUR, if you're on Arch, called doccli-bin or doccli-git in the

17:16.280 --> 17:17.760
AUR if you want to install that.

17:17.760 --> 17:24.640
So this is a Linux command line utility that KB Kanap wrote to manage your DigitalOcean

17:24.640 --> 17:28.560
droplet using their API and then submitted it into the show.

17:28.560 --> 17:29.560
Isn't that really cool?

17:29.560 --> 17:30.560
That is really cool.

17:30.560 --> 17:31.840
And so it's called DOCLI.

17:31.840 --> 17:35.920
And in fact, while we're talking about that, why don't I mention DigitalOcean?

17:35.920 --> 17:36.960
And she know about DigitalOcean?

17:36.960 --> 17:37.960
I sure do.

17:37.960 --> 17:42.040
Oh, you do use DigitalOcean like on a daily basis now that you're on that Minecraft server.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.040
And actually own cloud too.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.720
You use an own cloud all the time.

17:44.720 --> 17:49.280
Well, yeah, that's DigitalOcean is like our go-to now for when we need Linux infrastructure.

17:49.280 --> 17:54.460
We used to build out servers here in the garage, but it gets hot for one.

17:54.460 --> 17:57.560
And that gets ridiculous because I end up spending all my time doing system administration

17:57.560 --> 18:01.080
instead of podcasting, which doesn't make any sense.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.080
DigitalOcean makes a ton of sense.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.680
It's simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to

18:04.680 --> 18:05.720
spin up your own cloud server.

18:05.720 --> 18:10.520
And get ready for this, boss-level stuff here, if you use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, one

18:10.520 --> 18:14.120
word lowercase, DOUNPLUGGED, you get a $10 credit.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.120
That's like a two-month credit.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.120
It is.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.120
It is.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.440
Because you can get started for $5 a month and you can get going in under 55 seconds.

18:19.440 --> 18:26.800
And for $5 a month, you get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU and a terabyte

18:26.800 --> 18:27.800
of transfer.

18:27.800 --> 18:31.160
You just spin it up when you need it, spin it back down if you don't.

18:31.160 --> 18:32.160
It's pretty simple.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.880
They offer hourly pricing if you want to go that route.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.480
And then our $10 credit, DOUNPLUGGED, really, really gets you somewhere.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.720
And they have data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

18:40.720 --> 18:41.720
and in London.

18:41.720 --> 18:42.720
Isn't that proper?

18:42.720 --> 18:45.960
And a brand new one in Germany as well, which is super slick.

18:45.960 --> 18:50.000
It's got their fastest SSDs yet, which is already ridiculous that they're SSDs throughout

18:50.000 --> 18:52.800
that whole business, which is brave.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.140
And also, back when they first launched it, a little cray.

18:55.140 --> 18:56.840
But now, it's like, you got to have it.

18:56.840 --> 19:01.640
And now, all the other service providers are spending a ton of money trying to catch up.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.920
And meanwhile, DigitalOcean's like, that's cool, you can try to catch up.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.040
We're going to keep iterating.

19:05.040 --> 19:08.160
They just released a new version of their API a couple of weeks ago.

19:08.160 --> 19:12.180
They just rolled out support for Fedora 22 across the DigitalOcean infrastructure a couple

19:12.180 --> 19:13.360
of days ago.

19:13.360 --> 19:16.800
They've been working on Fedora 10, or I'm sorry, FreeBSD 10.1 support.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.960
They got new tutorials out there.

19:18.960 --> 19:23.480
But the best thing about DigitalOcean is that sweet interface.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.280
DigitalOcean has a beautiful intuitive control panel.

19:26.280 --> 19:30.440
Somehow they managed to make it easy and fast to use, crazy intuitive, but it's not watered

19:30.440 --> 19:31.440
down.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.480
The DigitalOcean control panel still allows you to do full feature DNS management.

19:34.480 --> 19:38.680
You can create and destroy and snapshot and make templates out of your droplets.

19:38.680 --> 19:42.000
And of course, they have one-click installation and deployments for the entire stack.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.880
So you can do a LAMP stack from the Linux kernel all the way up to Apache.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.800
Or you can say, I already have an existing Ubuntu machine.

19:47.800 --> 19:51.120
I want to deploy Ruby on Rails or GitLab, something like that.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.120
I love it.

19:52.120 --> 19:54.040
And if you use DO Unplugged, you get a $10 credit.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.200
You can see why I rave about it so much.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.120
And don't forget about their API.

19:58.120 --> 20:01.920
Just like our emailer did, you can extend the functionality of their dashboard with

20:01.920 --> 20:05.600
the API and start automating things, automating deployment, testing, spinning up machines,

20:05.600 --> 20:06.880
destroying of machines.

20:06.880 --> 20:07.880
It gets cray.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.920
Also, they have some of the best tutorials on the web.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.760
I think you can go check for yourself.

20:11.760 --> 20:16.680
Go to DigitalOcean, click on that community section, and then be like, boom, in my face.

20:16.680 --> 20:19.320
They're also hiring right now for Linux admins and content editors.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.320
Go check out DigitalOcean.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.280
Go look at their community section.

20:22.280 --> 20:27.120
Right now, they just posted Apache content caching on Ubuntu 14.04, Node.js application

20:27.120 --> 20:30.560
production and how to get started with FreeBSD 10.1 tutorials.

20:30.560 --> 20:31.560
It's good stuff.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.160
And they have professional editors and crap like that.

20:33.160 --> 20:37.120
I'm like, I don't even, at first, I was like, why are you guys doing all of this?

20:37.120 --> 20:39.760
People can just go here and read these, and they're not even applicable to DigitalOcean.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.400
Then I realized they're playing a long game.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.960
Because the thing is, at $5 a month, that gets you in the door.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.600
Because how are you going to beat that value?

20:46.600 --> 20:50.160
But then, for a lot of people, they can go to get these tutorials, and the value you

20:50.160 --> 20:54.760
get then out of that $5 because of these tutorials, they're unlocking stuff that, back when I

20:54.760 --> 20:58.480
did IT contracting, this was the secret of the business.

20:58.480 --> 20:59.480
This was the secret sauce.

20:59.480 --> 21:02.000
And I'm like, oh, that's why they're doing this.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.440
This is super smart.

21:03.440 --> 21:07.100
And then it really clicked with me when they started hiring multiple content editors and

21:07.100 --> 21:09.920
copyright editors and started paying people to submit tutorials.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.200
They're serious about this.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.800
And that completes the DigitalOcean picture.

21:12.800 --> 21:16.560
You've got those great SSDs, the great data center locations, the fantastic interface,

21:16.560 --> 21:20.160
Linux-based technology, KVM for the virtualization stack.

21:20.160 --> 21:24.160
And they're always current with CoreOS and Fedora, and they're keeping up with FreeBSD.

21:24.160 --> 21:25.440
They do a great job there.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.680
And then they wrap it all up with those fantastic tutorials.

21:27.680 --> 21:30.880
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED when you check out.

21:30.880 --> 21:34.680
And a great, big, huge thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

21:34.680 --> 21:36.240
Man, it is hot in here.

21:36.240 --> 21:37.880
Wow, it is hot in here.

21:37.880 --> 21:38.880
Holy smokes.

21:38.880 --> 21:39.880
Holy smokes.

21:39.880 --> 21:43.520
Anyways, I wanted to welcome Matthew Miller to the show from the Fedora Project.

21:43.520 --> 21:46.200
He heads the Fedora Project up over there, at least so far.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.160
Yeah, a year now.

21:48.160 --> 21:52.800
Yeah, so Matthew, what's the stat for the average Fedora Project lead?

21:52.800 --> 21:54.360
Is it something abysmal?

21:54.360 --> 22:01.360
Well, let's see, there's been only eight or so, so it's hard to get any good data.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.360
There's been eight, and Fedora's been around for...

22:03.360 --> 22:04.360
In like three months?

22:04.360 --> 22:05.360
No, I'm just kidding.

22:05.360 --> 22:06.360
No, but actually...

22:06.360 --> 22:07.360
Ten years.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.640
Yeah, eight and ten years.

22:08.640 --> 22:11.080
But I got a good feeling about you.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.120
I think you're going to make it for a while.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.120
So are you...

22:14.120 --> 22:15.120
Thank you.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.120
Are you doing okay?

22:16.120 --> 22:17.120
Are you exhausted from the big release?

22:17.120 --> 22:18.680
Have you caught your breath from Fedora 22?

22:18.680 --> 22:22.080
Yeah, I think from Fedora 22.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.640
That seemed like that was in the distant past at this point.

22:24.640 --> 22:25.640
Really?

22:25.640 --> 22:26.640
Already, huh?

22:26.640 --> 22:27.640
Wow.

22:27.640 --> 22:28.640
I'm a little exhausted.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.240
We had a big week last week.

22:30.240 --> 22:37.160
We had a release engineering FAD, which FAD is Fedora Activity Day, and so we flew a bunch

22:37.160 --> 22:38.160
of people into...

22:38.160 --> 22:43.040
Actually, this one was held at Red Hat's Westford office, which is...

22:43.040 --> 22:48.200
Westford is a distant suburb of Boston, so we flew a bunch of people in and there was

22:48.200 --> 22:49.640
a bunch of hacking.

22:49.640 --> 22:54.760
And that actually went on all weekend, but I ran away.

22:54.760 --> 22:57.660
But that was a big, big, cool, busy thing.

22:57.660 --> 23:02.480
But yeah, we're kind of busy working on infrastructure and stuff for Fedora 23 now, because a six-month

23:02.480 --> 23:03.600
cycle comes quick.

23:03.600 --> 23:04.600
Yeah, it does.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.760
So when you say infrastructure, what kind of things are being worked on at this point

23:07.760 --> 23:10.080
in this point of the release cycle already?

23:10.080 --> 23:16.600
Yeah, so a lot of this stuff is the build systems that we make the release with.

23:16.600 --> 23:21.880
And so that pretty much has to be in place by the alpha in order for it to really work.

23:21.880 --> 23:25.720
And actually, one of the things we have right now is that it's actually hard to make any

23:25.720 --> 23:31.120
changes after the alpha, which, again, that's basically halfway into the six months.

23:31.120 --> 23:35.480
And so the last six months, if we want to make a vagrant image all of a sudden because

23:35.480 --> 23:41.400
we decided at last minute that that's a high priority, it's hard to add those things on.

23:41.400 --> 23:45.360
And with the world changing so quickly, there's always last-minute things to add on.

23:45.360 --> 23:52.600
So part of the idea is to make it more flexible so we can hopefully have some more last-minute

23:52.600 --> 23:58.880
changes, getting more towards a continuous delivery of release engineering tools so that

23:58.880 --> 24:01.720
we can kind of adjust as we need.

24:01.720 --> 24:08.360
And then there's just a lot of technical debt and cleanup as all 10-year-old projects have.

24:08.360 --> 24:09.360
Sure.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.200
So 22 is out.

24:11.200 --> 24:15.840
Is there anything when you're going into 23 now that you're like, oh, we definitely didn't

24:15.840 --> 24:19.400
hit the right note on this point in 22 and we want to make sure we get this note right

24:19.400 --> 24:20.400
in 23?

24:20.400 --> 24:21.400
Is there anything that stands out for you?

24:21.400 --> 24:23.960
Because to me, 22 on the outside seems like a pretty great release.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.240
Yeah, no, I think it is a really great release.

24:26.240 --> 24:31.840
I think it's a lot of polish over Fatora 21, which was also a great release.

24:31.840 --> 24:33.280
So it's nice to have that increasing polish.

24:33.280 --> 24:36.480
And so I think so far we're seeing a lot of that kind of thing.

24:36.480 --> 24:42.760
There's a new feature for secure DNS, DNSSEC, that's being worked on right now, which I

24:42.760 --> 24:45.560
think is pretty cool.

24:45.560 --> 24:51.560
I think that in addition, that actually includes having a local resolver on your system, which

24:51.560 --> 24:53.520
we actually didn't have before.

24:53.520 --> 24:58.320
And I'm spoiled because I worked for universities and had local servers that were used.

24:58.320 --> 24:59.320
It makes a big difference.

24:59.320 --> 25:00.920
High quality and fast.

25:00.920 --> 25:06.840
But yeah, I installed this test feature and realized browsing the web at a coffee shop

25:06.840 --> 25:08.680
was like 100 times faster.

25:08.680 --> 25:09.680
So much faster over Wi-Fi.

25:09.680 --> 25:14.500
It's like, wow, I wish I would have done that years ago.

25:14.500 --> 25:17.080
So that's hopefully going to be default in Fatora 23.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.280
So that's a nice workstation feature there.

25:19.280 --> 25:20.280
Cool.

25:20.280 --> 25:26.000
I've also heard just today, I think I read that there's going to be support for firmware

25:26.000 --> 25:28.840
updates on new EFI machines from within Fatora.

25:28.840 --> 25:32.040
Can you talk about that?

25:32.040 --> 25:34.920
I think that that cover is about my knowledge of it.

25:34.920 --> 25:38.680
I know I talked a little bit to Peter Jones who's working on that.

25:38.680 --> 25:44.080
But yeah, that's basically so you don't have to go into some other operating system or

25:44.080 --> 25:47.880
some weird boot to update your firmware.

25:47.880 --> 25:52.360
And I just think as that becomes more prominent, that's going to be really nice.

25:52.360 --> 25:56.120
Now, Matt, one thing I had you on here before and I asked you about, and I was hoping to

25:56.120 --> 26:00.320
see more in 22 and I'm wondering what your thoughts are on 23 is, we see these when we

26:00.320 --> 26:04.280
go to conferences and events, and you must see it too when you travel, just these conferences

26:04.280 --> 26:07.960
and events, these Linux conference and events are awash in MacBooks.

26:07.960 --> 26:12.960
Like it's maybe sometimes like depending on the venue, 70% of the machines there, 80%

26:12.960 --> 26:16.020
of the machines there are MacBooks at Linux events.

26:16.020 --> 26:19.840
And so I have been just so desperate for a distribution to come along and say, we are

26:19.840 --> 26:23.520
really going to tackle the MacBook problem and handle its, you know, SMC firmware, its

26:23.520 --> 26:27.060
weird boot system setup and we're really going to try to understand this and make it easy

26:27.060 --> 26:31.840
for Mac users to have an open source workstation they can load on their premium hardware.

26:31.840 --> 26:36.040
Is this an area at all you guys are continuing to look at and any discussion there?

26:36.040 --> 26:37.040
Yeah.

26:37.040 --> 26:41.080
I mean, so the Mac hardware itself is kind of hard because it's not like Apple wants

26:41.080 --> 26:45.760
to bend over backwards to work with us on that kind of thing.

26:45.760 --> 26:48.840
Not that they're engineers or bad people or anything, just that it's not their company

26:48.840 --> 26:49.840
priority.

26:49.840 --> 26:50.840
It's not a priority.

26:50.840 --> 26:53.800
They definitely don't care about other operating systems running on their hardware.

26:53.800 --> 26:55.300
They're kind of a unified system.

26:55.300 --> 27:00.160
And so we often have problems with, you know, like wireless drivers and things like that.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.160
And the webcam.

27:01.160 --> 27:02.840
Yeah, exactly.

27:02.840 --> 27:04.560
So that's going to continue to be a challenge.

27:04.560 --> 27:08.440
We're going to continue to work on it because we love for it to work on the Mac hardware.

27:08.440 --> 27:13.240
I think we also have some other work going on to get it running on some of the nice,

27:13.240 --> 27:20.640
you know, Ultrabook kind of non Mac hardware that looks and feels as nice as that.

27:20.640 --> 27:25.780
I think traditionally Red Hat has given Lenovo laptops to all their employees.

27:25.780 --> 27:32.120
So Lenovo has been the safe laptop for Fedora and a lot of Linux distributions because of

27:32.120 --> 27:33.120
that.

27:33.120 --> 27:34.120
Yep.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.120
Yep.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.920
And I think we're and not that, you know, abandoning Lenovo or anything or that we actually

27:37.920 --> 27:39.360
had a formal commitment to that.

27:39.360 --> 27:43.080
But I think we're branching out on some of the shinier laptops as well.

27:43.080 --> 27:48.040
I know one of the desktop people was showing me one of these Kashiva laptops that splits

27:48.040 --> 27:53.160
in two so you can pull the tablet off and they had Fedora working on that.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.160
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

27:54.160 --> 27:55.160
It's kind of weird.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.160
Like you leave the keyboard behind.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.160
Yeah.

27:57.160 --> 27:58.160
Yeah, I've seen that.

27:58.160 --> 28:02.120
OK, so let's shift gears back to Fedora and the transition that's one of the big transitions

28:02.120 --> 28:05.680
been going on now for what, two releases or more, really?

28:05.680 --> 28:08.580
But really the last two releases, I feel like it came to the surface was the transition

28:08.580 --> 28:10.260
from YUM to DNF.

28:10.260 --> 28:11.820
And for the most part, it's been pretty clean.

28:11.820 --> 28:15.780
But I guess there's still like some cleanup to do, like perhaps GNOME software is still

28:15.780 --> 28:18.720
using YUM on the back end and so that can sometimes cause problems.

28:18.720 --> 28:20.200
How's that transition going?

28:20.200 --> 28:25.040
Actually, yeah, so actually there's a thing called Hockey or I'm not sure how you pronounce

28:25.040 --> 28:26.040
it.

28:26.040 --> 28:31.320
There's a library underneath it and both GNOME software and DNF are using it, but they're

28:31.320 --> 28:32.740
using it differently.

28:32.740 --> 28:34.240
And then YUM uses its own thing.

28:34.240 --> 28:38.360
So right now you could potentially have three different things going on.

28:38.360 --> 28:43.480
So there's that that will hopefully become more unified in I don't know if that's proposed

28:43.480 --> 28:47.160
for 23, but in the future, so it'll all be in one place.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.160
Yeah.

28:48.160 --> 28:52.800
So right now you can easily download all the repository metadata three times if you're

28:52.800 --> 28:53.800
using all those things.

28:53.800 --> 28:57.800
And that's kind of wasteful, a little unannoying.

28:57.800 --> 29:02.560
So how do I know as an end user that DNF is going to be it now for a while?

29:02.560 --> 29:06.500
Because I feel like YUM just finally kind of got squared away.

29:06.500 --> 29:11.000
So how do I know as an end user, like it's safe to invest in, I feel like when Linux

29:11.000 --> 29:15.960
distributions sort of change out these things, as an end user, I sometimes am left going,

29:15.960 --> 29:20.680
oh, now I feel like these core components that I thought were like temples of my distribution

29:20.680 --> 29:21.680
are interchangeable.

29:21.680 --> 29:25.720
And I'm not sure, I'm so sure I want to get really super connected to this new component.

29:25.720 --> 29:30.160
Is DNF here for the long haul or could you see it being replaced in a couple of years?

29:30.160 --> 29:33.880
That's open source and software in general for you.

29:33.880 --> 29:37.240
Something comes along even better for that than that.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.160
We will definitely look at it.

29:39.160 --> 29:44.680
I think that the team working on it at Red Hat is pretty committed to this.

29:44.680 --> 29:50.360
And they really lobbied to have it named something other than YUM4, which was kind of what I

29:50.360 --> 29:53.920
think in Fedora, a lot of us were hoping that that's what it would go to.

29:53.920 --> 29:59.920
And it really is like, it's for the basic things of like installing software upgrades,

29:59.920 --> 30:00.920
those kind of things.

30:00.920 --> 30:03.980
It's really like drop-in compatible, you don't have to think about it.

30:03.980 --> 30:08.280
But it behaves a little differently because it uses a different like mathematical approach

30:08.280 --> 30:11.880
for dependency solving, which means that your results might not be exactly the same.

30:11.880 --> 30:16.840
And they were worried that that would be more confusing to people if they didn't also emphasize

30:16.840 --> 30:20.240
that there was a change with the name change.

30:20.240 --> 30:21.700
So they won out on that one.

30:21.700 --> 30:23.200
So that's why we've got a new name.

30:23.200 --> 30:27.120
But that team is pretty committed to this being the future for that.

30:27.120 --> 30:31.840
And one of the things is that it is designed with sort of a modular architecture and a

30:31.840 --> 30:36.160
clean code base with a defined API and all these kind of modern software engineering

30:36.160 --> 30:45.360
ideas that YUM kind of grew up over the years into what it was.

30:45.360 --> 30:49.220
So there's a lot of, like you said, there's a lot of improvements and all that, but there's

30:49.220 --> 30:53.760
also a lot of cruft and it's getting harder for the developers to manage.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.600
Well, that's actually pretty old, isn't it?

30:55.600 --> 30:56.600
Yeah.

30:56.600 --> 30:59.640
I guess if it comes from Yellow Dog Linux, which isn't even around anymore, and Power

30:59.640 --> 31:01.640
PC hardware isn't even that prominent anymore.

31:01.640 --> 31:07.520
So yeah, it has been, it served a good purpose for a good long time, really.

31:07.520 --> 31:09.440
So that's pretty understandable.

31:09.440 --> 31:13.160
I like, you know, one of the things I like about Fedora is that it's a great place to

31:13.160 --> 31:18.680
sort of experience one of the latest versions of GNOME and GNOME 3.16 is no exception.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.320
It looks great under Fedora.

31:20.320 --> 31:26.200
And I've noticed the Fedora project is making really super minor tweaks to the default.

31:26.200 --> 31:30.220
It's pretty much a default GNOME experience, but there's a couple of things you guys change

31:30.220 --> 31:32.640
that nobody else does.

31:32.640 --> 31:37.080
One thing, elementary OS does it, but outside, but they're not using GNOME 3, is if you have

31:37.080 --> 31:40.840
a command in the terminal that completes and the terminal isn't active anymore, you've

31:40.840 --> 31:44.640
integrated it with the GNOME notification system to give you a notification that, hey,

31:44.640 --> 31:47.520
the command on your terminal that you're no longer watching has completed and you can

31:47.520 --> 31:49.020
return to your terminal now.

31:49.020 --> 31:50.020
Nobody else does that.

31:50.020 --> 31:52.120
And that's not a big deal, but I thought it was interesting.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.780
There's a specific Fedora tweak you're making.

31:54.780 --> 31:57.880
There's also discussions about Fedora willing to make tweaks to make the GNOME terminal

31:57.880 --> 32:00.400
transparent when it's not a default in GNOME 3.

32:00.400 --> 32:04.440
And there's another small one, like you have an extension that overlays a opaque Fedora

32:04.440 --> 32:07.440
logo over the background, small little tweaks to the GNOME desktop.

32:07.440 --> 32:11.840
Matthew, as you guys go forward, do you see Fedora continuing on the workstation spin

32:11.840 --> 32:17.840
to, or ring or whatever you want to call it, to make tweaks to GNOME or is it pretty much

32:17.840 --> 32:18.840
going to say stop?

32:18.840 --> 32:21.440
Because I kind of like where you guys are going with some of this stuff.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.440
Yeah.

32:22.440 --> 32:26.920
So I think we do really like keep following the upstream with a lot of our software is

32:26.920 --> 32:30.160
one of our main ways we work in Fedora.

32:30.160 --> 32:33.120
So we're going to keep to that as much as we can.

32:33.120 --> 32:36.720
But we also wanted it to kind of feel like it had a unique Fedora identity to it.

32:36.720 --> 32:38.320
That's the logo as part of that.

32:38.320 --> 32:42.240
And we might do some other kind of visual things as we go forward that will be maybe

32:42.240 --> 32:50.000
more subtle, but more subtle and less, you know, there's an F in your face.

32:50.000 --> 32:57.540
But also just different identity kind of theming kind of things might happen.

32:57.540 --> 33:01.680
But then some of the other things like the notifications that kind of come from the target

33:01.680 --> 33:07.360
audience for the Fedora workstation is we're trying to make it hit that people using Macs

33:07.360 --> 33:12.280
at the conference, sort of a software developer using a Mac is kind of one of the users.

33:12.280 --> 33:15.620
We have it as a primary target for this.

33:15.620 --> 33:18.640
And so that was one of the things we got feedback about that would be a little thing we could

33:18.640 --> 33:21.080
change that would that people would like.

33:21.080 --> 33:23.880
And so we're probably going to look at doing more and more of those things, especially

33:23.880 --> 33:28.480
as they hit somewhere on the Wiki, there's a target audience for Fedora workstation you

33:28.480 --> 33:29.480
can look at.

33:29.480 --> 33:34.640
And so that I don't have in front of me, but it's basically we're kind of focusing that

33:34.640 --> 33:38.160
feedback on the software development target and all kinds of software developers from

33:38.160 --> 33:41.400
independent to big enterprise to students.

33:41.400 --> 33:45.600
I like that sort of a sort of a way to focus where we're going, because when you try to

33:45.600 --> 33:49.560
make it be all things to all people, then somebody says, well, that's not me.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.040
And then and then you say, well, you're not all people.

33:51.040 --> 33:55.040
And it gets to be a whole like, who's this and who's that?

33:55.040 --> 33:59.800
But you know, when I was using it distinctly, the impression I got was this is the beginning

33:59.800 --> 34:02.440
of a small tweak you're making for it for a target audience.

34:02.440 --> 34:04.080
And that was essentially the impression I got.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.000
So it wasn't too much.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.680
And the other thing is, as somebody who reviews a lot of distributions, I install a lot of

34:10.680 --> 34:17.480
GNOME desktops and having super, super small things that give it a feeling that this is

34:17.480 --> 34:21.360
something unique I'm getting by installing Fedora, because what I don't like doing is

34:21.360 --> 34:26.400
installing Fedora and being like, OK, well, I've got what I had with Antigros four weeks

34:26.400 --> 34:27.400
ago.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.400
Right.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.520
I like when I install Fedora, I like going, oh, I only got this because I installed Fedora.

34:31.520 --> 34:33.040
That's the only way I could have got this.

34:33.040 --> 34:38.720
Not that it's a proprietary or it's exclusive, but it's just a nice touch that somebody went

34:38.720 --> 34:42.520
in and did that no other desktop environment, no other distribution, desktop distribution

34:42.520 --> 34:43.520
is doing.

34:43.520 --> 34:46.320
And so it makes it something kind of unique and it feels like extra thought went into

34:46.320 --> 34:47.480
it, even though it's something small.

34:47.480 --> 34:48.600
And so you guys build on top of that.

34:48.600 --> 34:49.600
I enjoy it a lot.

34:49.600 --> 34:50.600
Yeah.

34:50.600 --> 34:54.680
And so and that's kind of also kind of a visual indicator of something we feel is actually

34:54.680 --> 35:00.120
going on throughout the whole stack where you can see the GNOME desktop on the top and

35:00.120 --> 35:02.540
it might look like another GNOME test up anywhere else.

35:02.540 --> 35:07.320
But we also even our desktop team kind of works all the way down to the kernel level

35:07.320 --> 35:10.240
to try and make everything integrated together into one nice distribution.

35:10.240 --> 35:11.240
Yeah, you can feel it.

35:11.240 --> 35:15.960
We kind of want to remind you, we put in all this work into making this a whole integrated

35:15.960 --> 35:21.120
experience and you can't, you know, you can't just necessarily get that somewhere else because

35:21.120 --> 35:23.900
it won't be Fedora underneath.

35:23.900 --> 35:30.100
So before we run, I'm looking at the release schedule right here for Fedora 23.

35:30.100 --> 35:33.780
And if I see if everything goes as planned and, you know, sometimes it doesn't happen,

35:33.780 --> 35:40.640
it looks like October 27th, ooh, right by Halloween, a Halloween edition of Fedora.

35:40.640 --> 35:45.460
I don't know if you remember the old Red Hat Linux days, but some of the first releases

35:45.460 --> 35:49.480
of Red Hat Linux were Mother's Day and Halloween.

35:49.480 --> 35:54.400
And so those were the actual, you know, their release names or they actually had some secret

35:54.400 --> 35:57.120
code name, but that was like, that's what they're known as.

35:57.120 --> 36:00.840
And so we're with Fedora kind of following that tradition and actually kind of want to

36:00.840 --> 36:05.720
get back to Mother's Day and Halloween releases as a regular cadence that can help people

36:05.720 --> 36:07.520
follow that.

36:07.520 --> 36:08.520
I love it.

36:08.520 --> 36:09.880
It's whimsical in a way too.

36:09.880 --> 36:13.240
Well, and the next FAD day should be Fedora activity promotion.

36:13.240 --> 36:14.800
Yeah, there you go.

36:14.800 --> 36:15.800
Yeah.

36:15.800 --> 36:16.800
Promotion.

36:16.800 --> 36:17.800
Feb.

36:17.800 --> 36:18.800
Well, Matthew, is there anything else?

36:18.800 --> 36:19.800
Feb.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.800
No comment on that one.

36:21.800 --> 36:22.800
Feb.

36:22.800 --> 36:28.120
We do have a Fedora community-based Fedora marketing, I'm not touching that joke with

36:28.120 --> 36:29.120
the 10-foot pole.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.120
That's fine.

36:30.120 --> 36:31.120
Go ahead.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.120
Go ahead.

36:32.120 --> 36:36.280
We do have a community-based Fedora marketing team that anybody can join and take part in

36:36.280 --> 36:38.680
and help us promote what we're working on.

36:38.680 --> 36:42.800
So you're very welcome and invited to join us.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.160
Awfully punny with the touching.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.160
You are.

36:45.160 --> 36:46.160
You are good with that.

36:46.160 --> 36:51.680
So Fedora 23, anything else Matthew you want to touch on before we wrap up?

36:51.680 --> 36:56.280
I think one of the things we're kind of working on an initiative to, you know, you probably

36:56.280 --> 37:01.120
have seen your CoreOS and Ubuntu Snappy and those kind of things and we've been talking

37:01.120 --> 37:05.260
about Fedora rings for a while, kind of sort of seeing this as sort of a general sense

37:05.260 --> 37:10.800
in the way operating systems are going, but we're also kind of edging slowly into it.

37:10.800 --> 37:15.880
I think we're going to try and prototype some ideas around a modular OS that is kind of

37:15.880 --> 37:20.980
built up out of these different components because that seems like it's kind of the way

37:20.980 --> 37:25.840
of the future and it's what a lot of developers want and I think that it'll be a way that

37:25.840 --> 37:31.720
hopefully we can address some of this long-term support idea which we probably are really

37:31.720 --> 37:37.200
never going to do in Fedora because that doesn't fit our charter and sort of the way it works.

37:37.200 --> 37:41.060
There's a general problem in operating systems of everybody wanting it to move fast and everybody

37:41.060 --> 37:44.200
wanting to move slow both at the same time and nobody agreeing on which part they want

37:44.200 --> 37:49.120
to be which and so having the modular operating system lets us and our users make different

37:49.120 --> 37:51.080
decisions there.

37:51.080 --> 37:56.280
So we might be able to, for example, have some language API Python stack which we say,

37:56.280 --> 38:02.440
okay, Fedora release is retiring, but Django, for example, web stack, it's going to be the

38:02.440 --> 38:07.720
same API for three releases here or there'll be a version of the same API for three releases.

38:07.720 --> 38:13.000
So you know you can upgrade underneath it and keep your app running and that kind of

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
thing.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
So there's more possibilities there.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Good, good, good.

38:16.000 --> 38:21.060
Do you think we'll start to see the start of that in Fedora 23?

38:21.060 --> 38:22.600
But it's not going to be anything like that.

38:22.600 --> 38:25.960
It's not going to be a release artifact, but if you're following the development, you'll

38:25.960 --> 38:28.200
see some things along those lines.

38:28.200 --> 38:31.600
That sounds like a hint to keep our eyes peeled for further development there.

38:31.600 --> 38:32.600
Cool, Matthew.

38:32.600 --> 38:33.600
Yes, yes, exactly.

38:33.600 --> 38:34.600
Well, let's chat again soon.

38:34.600 --> 38:38.800
Maybe you can give us an update on that initiative and all the other goodness that's going on

38:38.800 --> 38:39.800
over there.

38:39.800 --> 38:40.800
You're always welcome to join us.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.600
Now that you've got Mumble built for Fedora, you have no excuse.

38:42.600 --> 38:43.600
Cool, yeah, yeah.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.720
And I have to figure out why it's not in the official repository.

38:46.720 --> 38:49.200
Somebody built it before and then got retired.

38:49.200 --> 38:53.160
You know, we might get more Fedora users in here if it gets fixed.

38:53.160 --> 38:57.680
All right, Matthew, you are welcome to hang out if you'd like.

38:57.680 --> 39:03.560
We're going to move in and get an update from Ange on her transition to Linux, which I've

39:03.560 --> 39:06.400
been pretty excited to watch.

39:06.400 --> 39:08.200
And we'll be reporting on it here in just a moment.

39:08.200 --> 39:11.640
But first, I want to tell you about our great friends over on Ting.

39:11.640 --> 39:12.640
That's right.

39:12.640 --> 39:13.640
Go to linux.ting.com.

39:13.640 --> 39:17.160
So that way you get to put Linux in your URL bar, in your URL bar.

39:17.160 --> 39:19.960
In Uncle Earl's bar, you could put linux.ting.com.

39:19.960 --> 39:24.840
But more importantly, right now, until the end of the month, $50 free conservation credit

39:24.840 --> 39:26.640
or $50 off your first device.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.760
Yep, that's amazing.

39:28.760 --> 39:33.000
That's so great because Ting's only pay for what you use, and so $50 is going to pay.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.940
I've got three phones, and I'm not paying $50 a month for three phones.

39:36.940 --> 39:37.940
So come on.

39:37.940 --> 39:39.680
It was like $47 last month.

39:39.680 --> 39:40.680
Yeah.

39:40.680 --> 39:41.680
Wow.

39:41.680 --> 39:42.680
I know.

39:42.680 --> 39:43.680
Isn't that great?

39:43.680 --> 39:44.680
Yes.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.160
It's $6 a month for the line, and then it's just my usage on top of that.

39:46.160 --> 39:49.360
Ting just takes my minutes, my messages, and my megabytes, and they add them all up.

39:49.360 --> 39:52.640
And so like, Angie and I, we used to have a plan of like, what was our... I don't want

39:52.640 --> 39:54.600
to say the name of the company because they're a bunch of jerks, but...

39:54.600 --> 39:56.100
Starts with an A.

39:56.100 --> 39:57.600
What was our monthly plan from them?

39:57.600 --> 39:58.600
$174.

39:58.600 --> 40:01.000
Oh, I thought it was less than that.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
$174 a month, and that's for two phones.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.880
Anyways, so you can go to Ting.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.040
You can go to linux.ting.com.

40:07.040 --> 40:08.480
You click that savings calculator.

40:08.480 --> 40:09.480
Find out how much you would save.

40:09.480 --> 40:11.240
You put your usage in there and find out.

40:11.240 --> 40:15.160
Also, just part of the service, hotspot, tethering, mobile, go caller ID, all that stuff.

40:15.160 --> 40:16.160
You just check the box.

40:16.160 --> 40:17.160
You got it.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.160
No hold customer service.

40:18.160 --> 40:19.760
No hold customer service.

40:19.760 --> 40:20.760
No hold customer service.

40:20.760 --> 40:26.140
You call my 1-855-TING-FTW anytime between 8 a.m. or 8 p.m., and a real human being answers

40:26.140 --> 40:27.140
the phone.

40:27.140 --> 40:28.140
I love it.

40:28.140 --> 40:29.600
And also, check out their blog.

40:29.600 --> 40:31.080
They've got great tips up there.

40:31.080 --> 40:35.240
Here's one they just posted today, a Ting tip for Android, how to return paid apps on

40:35.240 --> 40:36.240
Google Play.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.240
Ooh.

40:37.240 --> 40:40.200
That sounds really helpful, actually, because I never try to return digital things.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.720
And then when you finally want to do it, you're really pissed off.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.760
You just want to know how to do it because you got all worked up.

40:44.760 --> 40:45.760
Yeah.

40:45.760 --> 40:46.760
So they got a tip on how to do that.

40:46.760 --> 40:48.560
Also, check out the Ting shopping site.

40:48.560 --> 40:52.040
First, make sure you go to linux.ting.com, so that way your discount is applied.

40:52.040 --> 40:53.520
You can get a $9 Ting SIM card.

40:53.520 --> 40:55.200
They have GSM and CDMA.

40:55.200 --> 40:59.400
So if you just have something that has a GSM slot, and you can add the Ting service to

40:59.400 --> 41:00.400
that thing.

41:00.400 --> 41:01.800
It's great for like internet of service type things.

41:01.800 --> 41:02.800
Yes, I said it.

41:02.800 --> 41:04.180
It's good for like security cameras.

41:04.180 --> 41:05.700
It's great for all kinds of devices.

41:05.700 --> 41:08.640
It's great for two super tiny small phones like Noah has.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.020
And here's the thing.

41:10.020 --> 41:11.600
After that $9, you still have $41.

41:11.600 --> 41:12.960
Yeah, I know, right?

41:12.960 --> 41:13.960
I know.

41:13.960 --> 41:14.960
Check this out.

41:14.960 --> 41:17.080
I picked this phone out because I just think this is such a great one.

41:17.080 --> 41:20.720
The OnePlus One is now available for $250, unlocked.

41:20.720 --> 41:24.280
You own it from Ting, only pay for what you use, no contract.

41:24.280 --> 41:28.640
And by the way, if you are in a contract right now, Ting has an early termination relief

41:28.640 --> 41:29.640
program.

41:29.640 --> 41:32.000
You switch over, you get to pick from a CDMA or a GSM network.

41:32.000 --> 41:36.120
You get a dashboard that allows you to manage your device and your phone like you've never

41:36.120 --> 41:37.220
experienced before.

41:37.220 --> 41:39.960
And this is great if you have multiple devices or a single device, and you're going to get

41:39.960 --> 41:41.880
no whole customer service.

41:41.880 --> 41:46.020
Then you get to support the Linux Unplugged podcast, linux.ting.com.

41:46.020 --> 41:49.840
Go check out Ting and see why they truly are mobile that makes sense, and see why you can

41:49.840 --> 41:52.480
have a much better mobile experience.

41:52.480 --> 41:56.640
And you also get to help put pressure on the big duopoly to change the way they do business.

41:56.640 --> 41:57.640
Linux.ting.com.

41:57.640 --> 42:01.520
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

42:01.520 --> 42:05.280
All right, Andrews, let's talk about your switch over to Linux.

42:05.280 --> 42:09.960
And before the show, we came up with a couple of items that have been contention points

42:09.960 --> 42:10.960
for you so far.

42:10.960 --> 42:16.080
And, number one, which is not going to be a surprise to anybody in the mumble room.

42:16.080 --> 42:18.080
I know you guys are not going to be surprised at all.

42:18.080 --> 42:20.560
Nobody listening is going to be surprised by this.

42:20.560 --> 42:23.680
But Angela decided to take it upon herself to install some updates.

42:23.680 --> 42:25.880
You know, I watched to make sure it went fine because she was a little bit nervous because

42:25.880 --> 42:28.200
there's like a crap ton of updates, so it's pretty understandable.

42:28.200 --> 42:29.560
It always is.

42:29.560 --> 42:34.280
Every time I open the laptop, it has anywhere between 20 and 100 updates.

42:34.280 --> 42:35.840
But I kind of explained why, right?

42:35.840 --> 42:36.840
Yeah.

42:36.840 --> 42:37.840
It's all the programs on the computer.

42:37.840 --> 42:38.840
Yeah, it makes sense.

42:38.840 --> 42:39.840
Yeah.

42:39.840 --> 42:40.840
And you like getting all of them updated.

42:40.840 --> 42:41.840
Yeah.

42:41.840 --> 42:46.080
So one thing, though, is some of them come from the AUR, or the Arch User Repository.

42:46.080 --> 42:49.640
And I think one of the things you noticed, I noticed in the notes here, is sometimes

42:49.640 --> 42:52.320
these programs prompt you like three or four times for stuff.

42:52.320 --> 42:53.320
Yeah.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.320
So you have to babysit it.

42:54.320 --> 42:55.320
And they're not logical.

42:55.320 --> 42:58.800
Well, they might be logical questions, but for me, they make no sense.

42:58.800 --> 43:00.400
Do you want to edit the package build?

43:00.400 --> 43:01.400
Yeah.

43:01.400 --> 43:02.400
Like, I don't know.

43:02.400 --> 43:03.400
Do you want to continue building?

43:03.400 --> 43:04.400
Do I?

43:04.400 --> 43:05.400
I do want the update.

43:05.400 --> 43:06.400
If I say no, will it not update?

43:06.400 --> 43:07.400
Right.

43:07.400 --> 43:08.400
You know, I don't know.

43:08.400 --> 43:09.400
Yeah.

43:09.400 --> 43:11.080
But there was one where you were like, no, you say no to that.

43:11.080 --> 43:12.080
And I'm like, no.

43:12.080 --> 43:13.760
I thought it was going to be yes.

43:13.760 --> 43:17.160
Before you get crazy, the only thing she's really got coming from the AUR is Google Chrome,

43:17.160 --> 43:20.380
so that way her Netflix works, and like the Evil Pop GTK theme.

43:20.380 --> 43:21.380
It's not like a bunch of stuff.

43:21.380 --> 43:22.380
Yeah.

43:22.380 --> 43:23.520
But it does get updated.

43:23.520 --> 43:28.440
And so, and that's, that's, but do you think, are you, are you willing, like, is that like

43:28.440 --> 43:31.560
now that you know how to answer that, is that a, is that okay?

43:31.560 --> 43:33.560
Like if we did like a couple more times, you feel like you'd be fine with it?

43:33.560 --> 43:34.560
Yeah.

43:34.560 --> 43:37.320
I think I would need to either write down the questions and the answers, which I know

43:37.320 --> 43:41.440
is just yes or no's, but, or like even just the, the sequence, yes, no, yes, no.

43:41.440 --> 43:42.440
No, no, yes.

43:42.440 --> 43:43.440
I think it is.

43:43.440 --> 43:44.440
Yeah.

43:44.440 --> 43:45.440
Yeah.

43:45.440 --> 43:47.720
Um, cause like I said, what was logical to me was not the actual, was not the correct

43:47.720 --> 43:48.720
answer.

43:48.720 --> 43:49.720
So.

43:49.720 --> 43:50.720
Yeah.

43:50.720 --> 43:51.720
When we went through it.

43:51.720 --> 43:52.720
Yeah.

43:52.720 --> 43:53.880
And so for the most part, I've been doing the updates for her, but we decided to let

43:53.880 --> 43:56.880
her try it just to see how it goes so we can report back on the show.

43:56.880 --> 43:59.800
And usually the way we do it now is I update one of my machines first.

43:59.800 --> 44:00.800
Yeah.

44:00.800 --> 44:01.800
That's, that is, I do wait.

44:01.800 --> 44:02.800
Yeah.

44:02.800 --> 44:06.360
To do the updates because yeah, he could be, he could warn me if, if there shouldn't be

44:06.360 --> 44:07.360
an update.

44:07.360 --> 44:08.360
Yeah.

44:08.360 --> 44:09.360
Yeah.

44:09.360 --> 44:11.360
So that is definitely if you, if you install things for the user from the AUR.

44:11.360 --> 44:12.360
Yeah.

44:12.360 --> 44:13.360
Awesome.

44:13.360 --> 44:14.360
Now we do have some good news though.

44:14.360 --> 44:15.360
Okay.

44:15.360 --> 44:19.840
Uh, you have something that is improved from the Mac when switching to Linux.

44:19.840 --> 44:20.840
It's better under Linux.

44:20.840 --> 44:21.840
Yeah.

44:21.840 --> 44:22.840
Yes.

44:22.840 --> 44:23.920
And it's something that Mac Office didn't do very well for you that now is no longer

44:23.920 --> 44:26.240
an issue when you're using Office under Linux.

44:26.240 --> 44:27.240
Yeah.

44:27.240 --> 44:32.040
And I can't figure out exactly why, but basically it might just be because the Mac Office is

44:32.040 --> 44:33.160
like a really old version.

44:33.160 --> 44:34.160
I think it's 2011.

44:34.160 --> 44:35.160
Maybe.

44:35.160 --> 44:36.520
They updated it for like 200 years.

44:36.520 --> 44:37.520
Yeah.

44:37.520 --> 44:38.520
It's, it's so ridiculous.

44:38.520 --> 44:39.520
Approximately.

44:39.520 --> 44:40.520
And they still charge, they still charge like $2 million for it.

44:40.520 --> 44:42.120
These are all rough estimations.

44:42.120 --> 44:48.200
Well, so I've always had an issue with the formula bar on my, on my Mac.

44:48.200 --> 44:50.400
Like where you go to edit, like the, in Excel and this.

44:50.400 --> 44:51.400
Yeah.

44:51.400 --> 44:54.600
Like if I, yeah, if I want to go, if I click on a cell and I want to start a formula, normally

44:54.600 --> 44:56.040
you could just hit equals, right?

44:56.040 --> 44:59.920
But if I already have a formula there and I just want to copy it so I can paste it into

44:59.920 --> 45:06.780
another cell, I cannot get the formula bar to display at the top, to display the formula.

45:06.780 --> 45:11.360
And I've messed around with the, you know, where, where the toolbar is, but it will not,

45:11.360 --> 45:15.360
it will not, for the lack of a better word, it will not snap into place.

45:15.360 --> 45:17.880
And there's just something really weird about it.

45:17.880 --> 45:18.880
The UI is super weird about that.

45:18.880 --> 45:21.720
I end up having to work around formulas all the time.

45:21.720 --> 45:29.440
And the other thing is that if I do hit equals and I want to like include cells around that

45:29.440 --> 45:36.760
cell in the formula, it makes, it makes a temporary pop-up and it covers up the cells

45:36.760 --> 45:37.760
around it.

45:37.760 --> 45:38.760
Yeah.

45:38.760 --> 45:39.760
So I can't see them.

45:39.760 --> 45:41.240
The other thing I've noticed on our, on your list is.

45:41.240 --> 45:42.240
Well, wait, hold on.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.920
So, but I do not have that issue.

45:43.920 --> 45:44.920
That's what I was going to say.

45:44.920 --> 45:45.920
Yeah.

45:45.920 --> 45:50.040
So now you've been using Office 365 and other than it's a little cramped in the web browser

45:50.040 --> 45:51.040
you find, right?

45:51.040 --> 45:52.040
Yeah.

45:52.040 --> 45:53.040
Right.

45:53.040 --> 45:54.040
Yeah.

45:54.040 --> 45:57.160
Having it on a bigger monitor is, yeah, it's kind of hard to work on just the laptop screen.

45:57.160 --> 46:02.200
There's so much UI on Office 365 that it like puts the actual spreadsheet like halfway down

46:02.200 --> 46:03.200
the page.

46:03.200 --> 46:04.200
Yeah.

46:04.200 --> 46:05.200
Or more.

46:05.200 --> 46:07.920
It's like, yeah, half, half tools and toolbars and half.

46:07.920 --> 46:13.320
The ribbon UI is so fricking big that it takes up so much of the screen, but it's compatible

46:13.320 --> 46:14.320
with your spreadsheets.

46:14.320 --> 46:15.880
You didn't have to save them out.

46:15.880 --> 46:19.720
All the formatting, all the colors, you know, the color highlighting, the bolding.

46:19.720 --> 46:21.600
How do you feel about the way you're launching it right now?

46:21.600 --> 46:24.640
You have the, so I gave you an Excel icon, but it's like browser and browser.

46:24.640 --> 46:25.640
Is that a.

46:25.640 --> 46:26.640
That doesn't bother me.

46:26.640 --> 46:27.640
Good.

46:27.640 --> 46:28.640
No.

46:28.640 --> 46:32.080
As long as, I mean, if it took a really long time, like remember how Mac Word or Mac Office

46:32.080 --> 46:34.680
was running really slow for me on my previous Mac.

46:34.680 --> 46:35.680
Yeah.

46:35.680 --> 46:36.680
Yeah.

46:36.680 --> 46:39.560
If it got like that, then it would be, but it's pretty seamless.

46:39.560 --> 46:44.640
So I never tried Caligra, Heaven's Revenge is asking, because we got to Office 365 and

46:44.640 --> 46:46.160
it's been working for you.

46:46.160 --> 46:51.640
And the reason why I decided I liked it is because it kind of gives us a fail safe if

46:51.640 --> 46:52.880
you decide to move back at some point.

46:52.880 --> 46:54.520
I had originally tried Libre Office.

46:54.520 --> 46:55.520
Yeah.

46:55.520 --> 46:56.520
That didn't work.

46:56.520 --> 47:00.640
It really didn't work because of the, my spreadsheets were saved as.xlsx.

47:00.640 --> 47:06.200
So and I didn't, I don't want to go through and have to re-save everything if the Office

47:06.200 --> 47:07.200
365 works.

47:07.200 --> 47:08.200
Yeah.

47:08.200 --> 47:11.400
And like Heaven's Revenge, I already did spend the money.

47:11.400 --> 47:14.760
So I bought you a year subscription just to try it out.

47:14.760 --> 47:15.760
Who did?

47:15.760 --> 47:16.760
I did.

47:16.760 --> 47:17.760
Yeah.

47:17.760 --> 47:21.280
No, it's only like $9 a month, but yeah, I know it's, it's a full.

47:21.280 --> 47:22.280
Auto renew?

47:22.280 --> 47:23.280
I don't know.

47:23.280 --> 47:26.280
Let's cancel that card.

47:26.280 --> 47:27.280
We have so many subscriptions.

47:27.280 --> 47:28.880
We don't need to go into it.

47:28.880 --> 47:30.920
That's just the way this, the welcome to the new world.

47:30.920 --> 47:31.920
It's the cloud, baby.

47:31.920 --> 47:32.920
The new world of broke.

47:32.920 --> 47:33.920
I know.

47:33.920 --> 47:34.920
Geez.

47:34.920 --> 47:36.960
Now we have to talk about a travesty.

47:36.960 --> 47:37.960
Okay.

47:37.960 --> 47:41.280
A absolute, I had to watch a train wreck in front of my eyes.

47:41.280 --> 47:42.480
I stepped away.

47:42.480 --> 47:45.280
I had to cuddle myself to get over this.

47:45.280 --> 47:46.280
He's holding the notes.

47:46.280 --> 47:47.280
I have no idea what he's talking about.

47:47.280 --> 47:48.280
Remind me, please.

47:48.280 --> 47:49.280
Do you remember me shaking?

47:49.280 --> 47:50.280
No.

47:50.280 --> 47:51.280
No.

47:51.280 --> 47:52.280
What was it?

47:52.280 --> 47:59.280
Well, at one point you said, Chris, I've got to have icons on my desk.

47:59.280 --> 48:00.280
Oh yeah.

48:00.280 --> 48:01.280
Right.

48:01.280 --> 48:07.080
And so I was like, all right, honey, hit the medic key and type in tweak.

48:07.080 --> 48:08.080
Yep.

48:08.080 --> 48:09.960
And then you brought it up and went to the desktop section.

48:09.960 --> 48:10.960
Guess who knows about tweak now?

48:10.960 --> 48:11.960
Yeah.

48:11.960 --> 48:15.280
No, tweak has been, has been found by Angela and she turned on desktop icons.

48:15.280 --> 48:16.280
Yep.

48:16.280 --> 48:17.280
I just prefer it.

48:17.280 --> 48:23.560
Because with my photos, I prefer, as opposed to going through the directory, right?

48:23.560 --> 48:24.720
Is that the file directory?

48:24.720 --> 48:25.720
Yeah.

48:25.720 --> 48:26.720
Your home folder or whatever.

48:26.720 --> 48:27.720
Yeah.

48:27.720 --> 48:28.720
As opposed to going through there.

48:28.720 --> 48:30.280
I just want to throw it on my desktop because you know what?

48:30.280 --> 48:32.520
Browsers invent a drag and drop for a reason.

48:32.520 --> 48:33.520
Wow.

48:33.520 --> 48:34.600
That's what I'm saying.

48:34.600 --> 48:36.760
So I use social media enough that I-

48:36.760 --> 48:38.040
You want a drag and drop?

48:38.040 --> 48:39.640
Need the drag and drop.

48:39.640 --> 48:40.640
For social media?

48:40.640 --> 48:41.640
Yeah.

48:41.640 --> 48:44.440
Because you're dragging from your photo program to your desktop, from your desktop to your

48:44.440 --> 48:45.440
browser?

48:45.440 --> 48:46.440
Yes.

48:46.440 --> 48:47.440
That's fine.

48:47.440 --> 48:48.440
That's a flow, man.

48:48.440 --> 48:49.440
That's a flow.

48:49.440 --> 48:50.440
There's some things-

48:50.440 --> 48:51.440
I'll give it to you.

48:51.440 --> 48:52.440
It's a workflow.

48:52.440 --> 48:53.440
Yeah.

48:53.440 --> 48:54.440
It is a workflow.

48:54.440 --> 48:55.440
It is.

48:55.440 --> 48:56.440
Because you know, I have 80,000 pictures.

48:56.440 --> 48:57.440
Yeah.

48:57.440 --> 48:58.440
And well-

48:58.440 --> 48:59.440
And one desktop.

48:59.440 --> 49:00.440
Yeah.

49:00.440 --> 49:01.440
Well, they're just there temporarily.

49:01.440 --> 49:02.440
Yeah.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.120
So that was one of the things that Noah worked on is he made sure that-

49:04.120 --> 49:06.960
And by temporary you mean once you get a new computer.

49:06.960 --> 49:10.480
He made sure that he got me, no, no, shush.

49:10.480 --> 49:15.680
He got me Shotwell because it supports drag and drop without removing the picture from

49:15.680 --> 49:21.560
the library, which is what happened to me when I switched to Windows back in 2005 and

49:21.560 --> 49:24.240
was using Picasa.

49:24.240 --> 49:25.800
And that was, yeah.

49:25.800 --> 49:26.800
So.

49:26.800 --> 49:27.800
All right.

49:27.800 --> 49:31.680
Well, so that's Angela's update on her transition to Linux so far.

49:31.680 --> 49:33.200
And you're liking the Lenovo still too?

49:33.200 --> 49:34.200
Yeah.

49:34.200 --> 49:35.200
Yeah.

49:35.200 --> 49:36.200
You like the hardware.

49:36.200 --> 49:37.200
Yep.

49:37.200 --> 49:38.200
What do you think, Mumbleroom?

49:38.200 --> 49:39.200
How are we doing so far?

49:39.200 --> 49:40.200
Any tips or advice or notes for Angela to take home?

49:40.200 --> 49:43.200
Oh, look at that.

49:43.200 --> 49:46.680
A room full of critics has no criticism so far.

49:46.680 --> 49:50.000
I thought for sure we'd get some crap for the Office 365 thing.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
That's good.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
Nope.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
That's good.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.200
I tried getting it to work in Wine and then I tried getting it to work in Play and my

49:56.200 --> 49:59.120
attention span just just stopped.

49:59.120 --> 50:00.120
Yeah.

50:00.120 --> 50:01.120
I know, right?

50:01.120 --> 50:04.600
And then you realize, geez, I am trying so hard to get Microsoft Office working.

50:04.600 --> 50:06.860
Like it starts to eat at you a little bit.

50:06.860 --> 50:08.720
You know, I used Abbey Word back-

50:08.720 --> 50:09.720
Yeah, you did.

50:09.720 --> 50:10.720
In 2001.

50:10.720 --> 50:11.720
Yeah.

50:11.720 --> 50:12.720
You used it way back in the day.

50:12.720 --> 50:13.720
Yeah.

50:13.720 --> 50:14.720
And Gnumeric.

50:14.720 --> 50:15.720
Yeah.

50:15.720 --> 50:16.720
I didn't remember that.

50:16.720 --> 50:18.200
Gnumeric is what you used for your spreadsheets back in the day.

50:18.200 --> 50:19.200
Okay.

50:19.200 --> 50:20.200
Yeah.

50:20.200 --> 50:21.200
Yeah.

50:21.200 --> 50:22.200
I've been pretty excited to see it happen.

50:22.200 --> 50:23.640
Although part of me was hoping the whole thing would blow up and then we'd have a great

50:23.640 --> 50:25.080
Lenovo I'd have to play with.

50:25.080 --> 50:26.080
But that's fine.

50:26.080 --> 50:28.400
No, actually I'm really glad.

50:28.400 --> 50:31.880
Now I think our next step for you, and this is the one I've been dreading, is I want to

50:31.880 --> 50:32.960
tackle your dual monitor.

50:32.960 --> 50:34.120
But the reason why I've been dreading it-

50:34.120 --> 50:35.120
I know.

50:35.120 --> 50:38.800
Is like I think like we got to get like a series of adapters because the Lenovo is mini

50:38.800 --> 50:39.800
HDMI out.

50:39.800 --> 50:43.280
And that's the only thing it does is like, or micro HDMI, it's like the teensy-tinesy

50:43.280 --> 50:46.680
HDMI that's like for smartphones.

50:46.680 --> 50:47.680
That's the display out.

50:47.680 --> 50:48.680
Wow.

50:48.680 --> 50:51.840
And then that has to go to like, I don't know what your monitor is, DVI or DisplayPort or-

50:51.840 --> 50:52.840
I can't remember.

50:52.840 --> 50:53.840
Yeah.

50:53.840 --> 50:54.840
I think it's DisplayPort.

50:54.840 --> 50:57.480
So, but I think that's the next step so that way you don't have to have such crunched up

50:57.480 --> 50:58.480
spreadsheets.

50:58.480 --> 50:59.480
Yeah.

50:59.480 --> 51:00.480
Yeah.

51:00.480 --> 51:01.480
So we'll, maybe we'll report back on that soon.

51:01.480 --> 51:07.160
Well, thankfully my workflow, like I have just a couple spreadsheets that I maintain.

51:07.160 --> 51:09.840
Bills and Nanny, like mainly.

51:09.840 --> 51:15.520
And then everything else is in GDocs.

51:15.520 --> 51:16.840
So like are already online.

51:16.840 --> 51:18.780
So you do a lot of Google Docs too, huh?

51:18.780 --> 51:19.780
I do for a Jupyter broadcast.

51:19.780 --> 51:21.760
You got a big, you got a good mix of stuff, don't you?

51:21.760 --> 51:22.760
I do.

51:22.760 --> 51:23.760
Yeah.

51:23.760 --> 51:24.760
I am very diverse.

51:24.760 --> 51:25.760
Diversified.

51:25.760 --> 51:27.520
You are, you are diversificated, as they say.

51:27.520 --> 51:28.520
I think so.

51:28.520 --> 51:31.160
Well, I guess that makes the transition to different operating systems a little easier

51:31.160 --> 51:32.960
if it's all at least online.

51:32.960 --> 51:33.960
Mm-hmm.

51:33.960 --> 51:35.840
All right.

51:35.840 --> 51:37.520
So Mark Shuttleworth was on stage.

51:37.520 --> 51:38.520
I think, let me see.

51:38.520 --> 51:39.520
Do I have a date on this?

51:39.520 --> 51:42.640
I think it was today.

51:42.640 --> 51:43.640
Or not.

51:43.640 --> 51:44.640
It was a while ago.

51:44.640 --> 51:45.640
I'm not sure.

51:45.640 --> 51:49.920
But I just found this great video of Mark talking about, and just, Ubuntu is running

51:49.920 --> 51:52.080
on so many things today.

51:52.080 --> 51:56.240
And boy, wasn't Matthew just talking about that, about having a modular operating system

51:56.240 --> 51:58.680
and how there's all these kind of different demands for it.

51:58.680 --> 52:02.680
Well, Ubuntu Snappy just landed on something else that could be actually pretty cool, especially

52:02.680 --> 52:03.880
for you sysadmins.

52:03.880 --> 52:05.040
So we're going to, I'll play the video.

52:05.040 --> 52:08.600
It's kind of a funny video, because Mark tries to get the guy to guess what it is.

52:08.600 --> 52:10.080
And the guy has the hardest time guessing.

52:10.080 --> 52:11.600
It's so obvious, too.

52:11.600 --> 52:12.600
So stay tuned for that.

52:12.600 --> 52:16.780
But first, I'm going to tell you about our buddies over at Linux Academy.

52:16.780 --> 52:18.560
And do you know what I love about Linux Academy?

52:18.560 --> 52:19.560
Everything.

52:19.560 --> 52:20.720
Well, that's true.

52:20.720 --> 52:21.720
That's true.

52:21.720 --> 52:24.000
What I love about Linux Academy is they stole my great idea.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
They really did.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.160
I think if we were going to redo Jupyter Broadcasting today, this is the direction I would have

52:29.160 --> 52:30.160
gone.

52:30.160 --> 52:32.160
And I say that because I look at this and I go, oh, oh, oh.

52:32.160 --> 52:33.160
It kind of did what we did.

52:33.160 --> 52:36.600
You've got guys together that are super passionate about Linux and open source.

52:36.600 --> 52:40.040
The real enthusiasts, the people that follow this stuff as a part of their passion.

52:40.040 --> 52:43.280
You work on it during your day job, then you go home and you work on it, and you read about

52:43.280 --> 52:45.920
it during the weekends, and you talk about it with your friends online, and you argue

52:45.920 --> 52:46.920
about it in chat rooms.

52:46.920 --> 52:47.920
Hobby turned life.

52:47.920 --> 52:48.920
Yeah.

52:48.920 --> 52:49.920
That's these guys.

52:49.920 --> 52:50.920
And they went out and they created the Linux Academy platform.

52:50.920 --> 52:53.800
They got developers and educators together to create something they're truly passionate

52:53.800 --> 52:54.800
about.

52:54.800 --> 52:56.200
And I love that, because that sets them apart.

52:56.200 --> 52:58.160
That means the content they produce is genuine.

52:58.160 --> 53:01.600
It's from real people who are passionate about this stuff, just like the Jupyter Broadcasting

53:01.600 --> 53:02.600
Network.

53:02.600 --> 53:03.960
And they're updated.

53:03.960 --> 53:06.600
And they follow the trends, too, because they're following this stuff constantly.

53:06.600 --> 53:07.780
Yes, very much.

53:07.780 --> 53:13.080
And they also get that Linux users have specific requirements that some of the average generalized

53:13.080 --> 53:16.640
education sites that cover everything from kitchen sinks to Adobe After Effects don't

53:16.640 --> 53:17.640
care about.

53:17.640 --> 53:20.420
Like, for example, over at Linux Academy, you get seven-plus Linux distributions to

53:20.420 --> 53:21.420
choose from.

53:21.420 --> 53:24.160
They automatically adjust the courseware to those distributions.

53:24.160 --> 53:27.960
And I think this is super smart, is they throw in virtual machines that match the courseware

53:27.960 --> 53:28.960
with that.

53:28.960 --> 53:31.760
And those virtual machines match the distribution you chose for the courseware.

53:31.760 --> 53:33.600
And of course, that's the kind of thing Linux users care about.

53:33.600 --> 53:35.440
And of course, they're going to give you a remote SSH login.

53:35.440 --> 53:36.440
Of course, they're going to do that.

53:36.440 --> 53:37.440
They get you.

53:37.440 --> 53:40.600
They also have launched new courseware all the time, like new Red Hat certified courses

53:40.600 --> 53:43.000
that are great if you're going to go get your Red Hat certifications.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.800
They got Nuggets to help you deep dive on a single topic and get in and out in a couple

53:45.800 --> 53:47.120
of hours if you need.

53:47.120 --> 53:48.840
And anything, really, from two minutes to 60 minutes.

53:48.840 --> 53:52.000
It's great types of content that really help you take it up to the next level.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.700
Instructor help is always available.

53:53.700 --> 53:56.760
They have really good AWS courses out there, some of the best in the business.

53:56.760 --> 54:00.360
In fact, they just were awarded for some of their AWS content.

54:00.360 --> 54:03.080
And I also think you've got to go, if you've been a member now for a while, you've got

54:03.080 --> 54:05.160
to at least get a little interest in their Founder's Club.

54:05.160 --> 54:07.480
It's kind of like what we can offer for patrons.

54:07.480 --> 54:11.640
They have Founder's Club where they get to vote on new content, get beta access to things,

54:11.640 --> 54:14.780
help troubleshoot anything you find in the courseware through that Founder's Club.

54:14.780 --> 54:17.280
It's a great way, if you're really passionate about Linux Academy, to help them take it

54:17.280 --> 54:18.780
up a little bit to the next level.

54:18.780 --> 54:21.380
They launch new courseware all the time, so do this.

54:21.380 --> 54:22.800
And we have a great discount if you do this.

54:22.800 --> 54:25.480
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

54:25.480 --> 54:29.720
You'll get our 33% discount when you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

54:29.720 --> 54:32.880
Buy them out for a little while, try out some of the courseware, take a few different courses,

54:32.880 --> 54:36.440
the self-paced labs, select your availability for how much coursework you have, and they'll

54:36.440 --> 54:38.720
set up a courseware based around your availability.

54:38.720 --> 54:40.600
It's really, really good stuff.

54:40.600 --> 54:42.920
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

54:42.920 --> 54:44.960
Get our 33% discount.

54:44.960 --> 54:49.300
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

54:49.300 --> 54:50.300
You ready to see this video?

54:50.300 --> 54:51.300
Yeah.

54:51.300 --> 54:52.300
Okay.

54:52.300 --> 54:54.040
So maybe Poppy might already have seen this.

54:54.040 --> 54:56.880
You know, Poppy, he's hooked in over there at the Canonical HQ.

54:56.880 --> 55:01.600
But this is Mark Shalterworth up on stage, and he's introducing a new device, a new category

55:01.600 --> 55:04.920
device that runs Ubuntu Snappy, and he wants to see if this guy can figure it out.

55:04.920 --> 55:07.680
You're just going to tell us what you see.

55:07.680 --> 55:08.680
Okay.

55:08.680 --> 55:09.680
Okay?

55:09.680 --> 55:10.680
Yeah.

55:10.680 --> 55:11.680
You ready?

55:11.680 --> 55:12.680
Yeah.

55:12.680 --> 55:13.680
All right.

55:13.680 --> 55:14.680
Let's go.

55:14.680 --> 55:15.680
I can tell you what it is by the sound of it.

55:15.680 --> 55:16.680
I can tell what it is by the sound of it.

55:16.680 --> 55:17.680
Doesn't that sound like our closet?

55:17.680 --> 55:18.680
Yes.

55:18.680 --> 55:19.680
Come around.

55:19.680 --> 55:20.680
Come around.

55:20.680 --> 55:21.680
Look from this side.

55:21.680 --> 55:22.680
You have to look from every angle.

55:22.680 --> 55:26.360
The guy's checking it out.

55:26.360 --> 55:27.360
He's getting up close.

55:27.360 --> 55:28.360
I'm gassy.

55:28.360 --> 55:29.840
You know, like a blade server.

55:29.840 --> 55:30.840
A blade server.

55:30.840 --> 55:31.840
He's like a blade server.

55:31.840 --> 55:32.840
Yes.

55:32.840 --> 55:33.840
With all of these port thingies in the front.

55:33.840 --> 55:34.840
Yeah, with all these ports.

55:34.840 --> 55:35.840
Really?

55:35.840 --> 55:36.840
Okay.

55:36.840 --> 55:37.840
So.

55:37.840 --> 55:38.840
Anybody want to help him out?

55:38.840 --> 55:39.840
A switch?

55:39.840 --> 55:40.840
A switch?

55:40.840 --> 55:41.840
A switch.

55:41.840 --> 55:42.840
What do you think?

55:42.840 --> 55:43.840
Switch.

55:43.840 --> 55:44.840
Okay.

55:44.840 --> 55:45.840
You think it's a switch?

55:45.840 --> 55:46.840
Okay.

55:46.840 --> 55:47.840
Okay.

55:47.840 --> 55:48.840
Look close.

55:48.840 --> 55:49.840
Okay.

55:49.840 --> 55:50.840
Okay.

55:50.840 --> 55:58.240
Yes, it's a switch.

55:58.240 --> 55:59.720
With a lot of connecting there.

55:59.720 --> 56:00.720
Yes.

56:00.720 --> 56:01.720
I mean, the port.

56:01.720 --> 56:02.720
It's a switch.

56:02.720 --> 56:03.720
So it's sort of a trick question.

56:03.720 --> 56:04.720
Not really.

56:04.720 --> 56:06.440
But you did exactly the right thing.

56:06.440 --> 56:08.440
It's a switch, right?

56:08.440 --> 56:09.440
Okay.

56:09.440 --> 56:10.440
Thank you very much.

56:10.440 --> 56:11.440
You're welcome.

56:11.440 --> 56:17.440
And he's exactly right.

56:17.440 --> 56:18.440
He's exactly right.

56:18.440 --> 56:19.880
It is a switch.

56:19.880 --> 56:26.000
And to prove it, here is the software running on that switch, right?

56:26.000 --> 56:31.480
It's a switch with switch control software.

56:31.480 --> 56:39.280
Except the switch is actually running the new version of Ubuntu called Snappy Ubuntu

56:39.280 --> 56:40.280
Core.

56:40.280 --> 56:46.200
And it's not just running switch control software.

56:46.200 --> 56:48.760
It's also running this.

56:48.760 --> 56:56.360
It's running something from Miracura, which is a software-defined networking solution.

56:56.360 --> 56:57.400
So there you go.

56:57.400 --> 56:58.400
Quite a package.

56:58.400 --> 57:03.480
You've got a switch that runs Ubuntu with all of the benefits and features thereof,

57:03.480 --> 57:09.480
a full-fledged operating system with management GUIs and things like that.

57:09.480 --> 57:13.360
And also, Mark Shuttleworth talked about all other kinds of devices.

57:13.360 --> 57:14.360
We've seen fridges.

57:14.360 --> 57:15.360
What do you think, And?

57:15.360 --> 57:17.560
You're going to have Linux on everything in the house one day.

57:17.560 --> 57:21.080
Everything from your fridge to the hardware that runs the house.

57:21.080 --> 57:23.240
I think they could have used a quieter device.

57:23.240 --> 57:27.040
That was pretty annoying, wasn't it?

57:27.040 --> 57:30.640
It does sound exactly like our closet, which I would also like to be replaced sometime

57:30.640 --> 57:31.640
soon.

57:31.640 --> 57:32.640
Yes, I know you would.

57:32.640 --> 57:33.640
Yes, thank you, honey.

57:33.640 --> 57:34.640
I know.

57:34.640 --> 57:38.480
Guys, any thoughts on Canonical's efforts on the Internet of Things and these embedded

57:38.480 --> 57:39.480
devices?

57:39.480 --> 57:41.880
You think this is going to be the next big frontier for them?

57:41.880 --> 57:42.880
Nothing.

57:42.880 --> 57:43.880
Hold on.

57:43.880 --> 57:44.880
Hold on.

57:44.880 --> 57:45.880
Let me get the right.

57:45.880 --> 57:46.880
Hold on.

57:46.880 --> 57:47.880
Hold on.

57:47.880 --> 57:48.880
Let me get the...

57:48.880 --> 57:49.880
I got it here.

57:49.880 --> 57:50.880
Hold on.

57:50.880 --> 57:51.880
I know what I need.

57:51.880 --> 57:52.880
There we go.

57:52.880 --> 57:53.880
Nobody has any comments on the story?

57:53.880 --> 57:54.880
All right.

57:54.880 --> 57:55.880
We'll move on then.

57:55.880 --> 57:56.880
Yeah.

57:56.880 --> 57:57.880
It's basically Noah's house.

57:57.880 --> 57:58.880
Exactly, Micah.

57:58.880 --> 57:59.880
Exactly.

57:59.880 --> 58:00.880
That's what Micah says in the chat room.

58:00.880 --> 58:01.880
He says, basically, it's Noah's house.

58:01.880 --> 58:02.880
PF...

58:02.880 --> 58:03.880
We have PF Sense and a switch in our closet.

58:03.880 --> 58:04.880
Yeah.

58:04.880 --> 58:05.880
Yeah.

58:05.880 --> 58:06.880
I think it's a fascinating move.

58:06.880 --> 58:07.880
I love it.

58:07.880 --> 58:11.880
I love the idea of everything running on Ubuntu.

58:11.880 --> 58:16.480
If you could have a network, just to picture it, your servers, your desktops, your switches,

58:16.480 --> 58:18.680
your routers, it could be a disaster.

58:18.680 --> 58:20.960
But the idea seems fascinating to me.

58:20.960 --> 58:24.900
And so Canonical has a whole page up about all this over on their site.

58:24.900 --> 58:25.900
You can go find it.

58:25.900 --> 58:28.040
I have it linked in the show notes if you guys want to read more.

58:28.040 --> 58:30.040
They talk about critical infrastructure devices.

58:30.040 --> 58:34.640
They even talk about robots on the page and appliances like door locks and whatnot and

58:34.640 --> 58:35.640
drones too.

58:35.640 --> 58:36.640
Cool.

58:36.640 --> 58:37.640
Yeah.

58:37.640 --> 58:38.640
The whole range of stuff.

58:38.640 --> 58:39.640
Go check it out.

58:39.640 --> 58:40.640
I would cry.

58:40.640 --> 58:44.520
Wimpy, you think it's useful for home automation and routers like Ubuntu Snappy on these Linksys-type

58:44.520 --> 58:45.520
devices?

58:45.520 --> 58:46.520
Not necessarily.

58:46.520 --> 58:53.840
Well, it probably is suitable for home automation, but I'm more thinking about the consumer grade

58:53.840 --> 58:59.920
wireless routers and broadband routers that once they go out the door, they get updates

58:59.920 --> 59:03.800
for a few months and then never again.

59:03.800 --> 59:11.440
And Snappy Core does provide a mechanism of patching the underlying OS without breaking

59:11.440 --> 59:12.440
the whole system.

59:12.440 --> 59:18.400
So it will be interesting to see if it gets adopted by the likes of TP Link and organizations

59:18.400 --> 59:21.120
like that as the basis for their consumer products.

59:21.120 --> 59:24.440
Is TP Link and Linksys a problem been that the operating system is hard to update or

59:24.440 --> 59:27.160
is it just been that the vendor lacks the will to do it?

59:27.160 --> 59:29.040
Like it's just not their business priority.

59:29.040 --> 59:30.460
Yeah, that's true.

59:30.460 --> 59:34.840
But Snappy Core removes some of that complexity because the base operating system is taken

59:34.840 --> 59:37.720
care of for you by Canonical.

59:37.720 --> 59:38.720
Fair point.

59:38.720 --> 59:39.720
Fair point.

59:39.720 --> 59:40.720
I would love to see that work out.

59:40.720 --> 59:43.920
I think that's a major problem we have with all these devices connected and we've talked

59:43.920 --> 59:48.940
about this on last week's episode of TechSnap a little bit, is that we were pushing out

59:48.940 --> 59:51.960
all these devices that run operating systems and we still haven't patched.

59:51.960 --> 59:54.240
We still haven't figured out the last round, like all these routers and all that things.

59:54.240 --> 59:57.960
I have so many vulnerabilities that we've talked a lot about in TechSnap.

59:57.960 --> 59:59.240
I don't have much more.

59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.240
We have a thread.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.240
I think I'll keep it for the post-show.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.400
Matthew, thanks for joining us on Unplugged today.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.400
It was good to have you here.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:10.920
There's a link to the Fedora project and your page, so folks can find that.

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:13.560
Anywhere else you want to send people to?

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.560
Get fedora.org.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.040
Is that what you are linking to?

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.040
Ah, yes.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.520
No, I will link to that as well.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.520
Get fedora.org.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.520
Yes, of course.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.520
Thank you, sir.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.160
Sort of the download brochure page.

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:27.840
If you're an old school familiar with Fedora, it's probably not where you want to land,

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:32.520
but for new users and just kind of like showing somebody what's available and what you need

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.240
to start with, that's kind of the place to go.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.360
And it's where you go to download it, of course.

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:37.360
Yeah.

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:38.360
Excellent.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.360
I love it.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.360
I will add that to our show notes.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.360
Episode 96 is in the can.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.160
If you have any comments, go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.520
There will be a feedback thread in there.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.360
And you can also join us next Tuesday at 2 p.m. Pacific.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.840
Go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your local time.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.280
And thanks for joining me.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.280
Yeah, no problem.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.280
Do you want to plug anything?

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.680
Like Jupiter Signal, at Jupiter Signal on Twitter?

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:02.560
Yes, but also Women's Tech Radio with Shannon tomorrow.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.560
Shannon Morris.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.560
Mm-hmm.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.560
Snubs will be on Women's Tech Radio tomorrow.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.560
It'll be out in the morning.

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:07.560
Yep.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.560
Check that out at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.560
Yeah, that's a good one.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.560
Yeah.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.560
All right, everybody.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:12.560
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.120
See you right back here next Tuesday.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.120
Cool.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.120
Thanks for having me.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:34.360
Thanks for having me.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:02:01.680
All right, we're all done.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.680
We're all out.

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:03.680
Good show.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.680
That was good.

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:05.680
Ah, Fujino missed it.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.680
Aw.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:10.480
And he was particularly interested in my advancement in Linux.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:13.160
Well, he'll have to get it on download, unfortunately.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.880
Hey, I go to JB Titles.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:15.880
It's called Go Boat.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.600
And then I wanted to share this thread that was in the subreddit with you guys about distro

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:19.600
hopping.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:20.600
Let's go boat.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:21.600
Everybody go boat.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:22.600
JBtitles.com.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.600
Source forgery, that's not bad.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.600
Fedora's fabulous fapping fad.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.600
No.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.600
It's literate.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:27.600
I'll give you that.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:28.600
I know.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.440
I can always count on the internet to pick up my...

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.640
Yes, you can.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.200
I do like having something with Fedora in there.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:37.840
All right, so here is the distro hopping thread from Last Feedback.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.440
I wanted to put this in here because I feel like he created this account just to give

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.560
us feedback because this account is called Last Feedback.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:46.080
It says, in my humble small role, I notice a lot of people hop to various distros.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.080
Some consider it good.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:50.120
Some consider it a fault of Linux community, fragmentation, et cetera.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.120
Here's my thoughts on why people could be hopping distros.

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:56.920
Number one, I think noobs are attracted to Linux, read articles, have opinionated friends,

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:57.920
and give them initial thoughts.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.580
When this happens, their decisions, opinions are vastly influenced by media, FUD, et cetera.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:05.280
For a noob, there's no difference between Etsy, Init RD, Upstart, or System D. It just

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.640
requires somebody telling them the sky is falling.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:14.040
I think number two, first and foremost, is about being comfortable with the base installation

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.860
config files, package management, the desktop.

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:20.440
Those who attain certain level of power users capability don't need to hop distros.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.040
Now I also, I would branch off this and say one of the reasons I hop distros early on

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.680
is I would find one distro had one set of tools.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.680
I like to do one task.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.360
A different distro would have a different set of tools to do another task.

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.200
He says, not every distro is suitable for everyday users.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.720
Distros specialize on certain specific aspects of a workflow.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.720
That's kind of what I'm thinking.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:40.600
A given user coming from, say, Windows or Mac may not be accustomed to these workflows.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:44.880
But I really like some of the points that were made in the subreddit thread following.

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:49.040
He says, so Rob said, he says, I don't think distro hopping is limited to new users.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.040
I think it's a different kind of distro hopping for new users than for experienced users.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.800
Aha, I completely agree with that one.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:01.040
P4 or P3R says, we should try to funnel users to specific distros like Ubuntu or Mint for

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.040
new users.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.040
Or Fedora.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.040
Or Fedora.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.040
That's right.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.360
Yeah, so it was a good thread.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:12.920
Or try to figure out what that person is trying to achieve instead of like shoe hoarding them

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:18.040
into Ubuntu or Mint strictly saying, okay, what are you doing?

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.600
What do you want to achieve?

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:24.680
And see how you can try to understand their needs and point them to the right desktop.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.960
Desktop environment or distro for them instead.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:29.960
Sun Sol, go ahead.

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:30.960
You can talk.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:31.960
We're after the show.

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:37.440
Hey, so in terms of like distro hopping.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:41.720
So in my experience with distro hopping, I do it for terms of accessibility.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.040
I'm a blind Linux user.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:47.480
So I look to see accessibility as a key factor in how distributions work.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:51.520
So Fedora is one of those accessibility that I look at.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.080
And some other distros like Arch as well.

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.080
Yeah, I like that.

01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.080
That makes a lot of sense.

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.400
I'm going to up Fedora's bright future.

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.400
I like that one.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.760
Yeah, the accessibility thing could be a big driver.

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.760
That makes a lot of sense.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:04.760
Yeah, I'm glad.

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:07.400
I know there's been a lot of effort in GNOME for that.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:10.200
So I'm glad that's working for you.

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:15.560
Yeah, I actually do some of the bug reporting and trying to get some of that stuff improved.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:17.040
Awesome.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.040
Ange learns to tweak.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.040
That's not bad.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.800
What do you think of that one?

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:21.800
Ange learns to tweak.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:22.800
That's awesome.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.240
Source Forgery is going at the top.

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.240
But I like it.

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.240
It's clever.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.200
But I feel like we should probably spend more time on Fedora in the title because that's

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:30.760
kind of more what was sort of mentioned throughout the whole episode.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.720
I'm liking Fedora's bright future by Odyssey Westroad.

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:34.720
I like that one.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.720
Yeah, I bet.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:36.720
Yeah.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.720
Linux undressed.

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:38.720
What?

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:39.720
Oh, geez.

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:40.720
It looks familiar.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.720
Evolving Fedora.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:42.720
Trick or treat Fedora 23.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:43.720
We should save that for when it comes out.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:44.720
Yeah.

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:45.720
That's a good title for when it comes out.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:46.720
They're spooky goings on.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:47.720
What did FAD stand for again?

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.720
What's that?

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.120
What did FAD stand for again?

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.040
Fedora Activity Day.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.600
Fedora Activity Program.

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.600
Day.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.600
Promotion is what I suggested.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.600
Yeah.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.600
Day.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:05:59.600
Day is what we're going with there.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.600
Day.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.600
Day.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.200
It's one of the things that we spend out of our community budget for, to bring people

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.200
together.

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.200
Oh, so you pay.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.200
It could be Fedora Activity Pay.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.200
Uh-huh.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.200
Uh-huh.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.200
I see a focus.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.200
Letter choices.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:20.280
I see a focus.
