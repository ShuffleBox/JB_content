WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.720
All right, I got a question for you anybody in the mumble room or anybody in the chat room

00:04.320 --> 00:09.280
Trying out pale moon. I don't know I guess after this whole chromium download a binary in the background thing

00:09.280 --> 00:11.280
I'm kind of just keeping my eyes open and

00:11.360 --> 00:12.980
I've known about pale moon for a while

00:12.980 --> 00:18.780
It's an open source Firefox web browser, and it's available for Linux and other operating systems that probably exist

00:18.780 --> 00:20.360
But I can't confirm their existence

00:20.360 --> 00:22.240
So if you like everything about Firefox

00:22.240 --> 00:28.060
But you want to independently develop source with carefree selected features and optimizations to maximize the browser speed stability and user experience

00:28.060 --> 00:30.060
pale moon

00:30.740 --> 00:32.740
anybody trying it in the mumble room I

00:33.700 --> 00:35.860
I've tried out pale moon for a while

00:35.860 --> 00:40.180
But there were a few of my plugins that just straight-up wouldn't work with this so I had to go back to Firefox

00:40.180 --> 00:46.140
Oh really Romeo, which ones and do you remember which ones in particular stood out to you um I off the top of my head

00:46.140 --> 00:50.120
I think that it may have been you block origin, but I'm not a hundred percent on that

00:50.980 --> 00:54.380
Pursuit of men says he can't watch Netflix on it rotten corpse. Did you try it out at one point?

00:54.380 --> 01:00.500
Well, yeah, I've tried out pretty much every everything like ice weasel ice cat everything that's based on Firefox

01:00.500 --> 01:03.660
Just to see the difference in the stuff, and they're pretty much all the same

01:03.660 --> 01:10.500
They're pretty much Firefox with slight tweaks. Branding removed obviously. Yeah, it's still Firefox. Yeah, like it doesn't matter

01:10.500 --> 01:16.060
Okay, the only the only thing I actually hate right now about Firefox is why I'm not using it is uh

01:16.620 --> 01:23.620
That stupid pocket crap they believe that is what that that's what that's what makes you stop using Firefox is the only thing

01:23.620 --> 01:27.620
Firefox is the pocket integration what about decent process isolation I?

01:28.660 --> 01:31.900
Think the process isolation is awesome. Have you ever used tried electrolysis?

01:35.700 --> 01:41.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, all right fine fine. I'm not gonna get it. I'm not going down this conversation again

01:41.160 --> 01:45.340
I've done too many episodes where people have told me about all the stuff that Firefox is gonna do one day

01:46.100 --> 01:50.300
Firefox is great. It's great. No yeah, it's great. You can get it right now. You can use it today

01:50.300 --> 01:54.940
It's just ready to go. It's production-ready. That's why it's included with every single Firefox installed by default

02:02.380 --> 02:08.060
Electrolysis for a few weeks of nightly when first came out, but Chris on this one

02:10.740 --> 02:12.740
First came out

02:12.740 --> 02:17.520
I'm going to point out

02:22.820 --> 02:25.360
What about what about your computer you're recording shows on

02:32.740 --> 02:34.300
Yeah

02:34.300 --> 02:39.440
No, I mean like on my on my personal laptop that I like my XPS 13. Yeah sure why not

02:39.980 --> 02:41.700
Have fun with it

02:41.700 --> 02:45.380
But on the machine that I'm just you know on the machines that I'm displaying

02:46.100 --> 02:52.380
Webpages on for shows and and things like that. I just Chrome. I just feel like is the best bet still I hate it

02:53.540 --> 02:56.780
This is Linux unplugged episode 99 for June 30th

02:57.860 --> 02:59.860
2015

02:59.860 --> 03:01.860
You

03:10.420 --> 03:12.220
Welcome to Linux unplugged your

03:12.220 --> 03:18.580
Weekly Linux talk show that wonders perhaps somewhere out there is there a beer keg and an air conditioner combo

03:18.700 --> 03:21.820
My name is Chris and today is a hot day in the studio

03:21.820 --> 03:27.540
It's 90 degrees as we record episode 99 somehow that almost feels appropriate. I'm not even gonna complain

03:27.540 --> 03:32.140
It should be hot on episode 99 now coming up on this week's episode of the unplugged program

03:32.140 --> 03:36.260
We're going to talk about Cisco buying our favorite DNS service open DNS

03:36.260 --> 03:42.700
We're also talking about Linux Mint 17.2 being released a new cinnamon edition of that as well as valves

03:42.700 --> 03:45.100
huge news regarding steam machines and

03:45.780 --> 03:52.940
Pulse video is it going to be the pulse audio for Linux's video woes that rumor is circulating around the web this week

03:52.940 --> 04:00.620
We'll be discussing that as well as the next meetup for the Jupiter broadcasting crew and a little bit more in fact

04:00.620 --> 04:05.300
I know you guys usually you'll have to just you'll just have to grant me this one

04:05.300 --> 04:09.220
Sometimes I love to talk about video gaming under Linux because I feel like there's so much potential here

04:09.220 --> 04:12.780
It's such a good system and games need an open platform

04:12.780 --> 04:16.700
So that way artists can express their passion and Linux and open source are so perfect for that

04:16.700 --> 04:20.180
So this week I'm gonna raise all I will resist the temptations

04:20.180 --> 04:25.300
But I have to share at least one amazing game that I've been it's a category of games that I've been waiting to come

04:25.300 --> 04:28.700
To Linux for a long time that have been severely lacking. I won't spend a lot of time on it

04:29.140 --> 04:32.380
But as a little treat to myself, I'm also gonna talk about one of my new favorite games

04:32.380 --> 04:34.340
It's come to Linux and I really want you to try it

04:34.340 --> 04:36.180
I won't spend too much time, but you got to give it to me

04:36.180 --> 04:39.920
You got to give me but first we have some interesting follow-up on some stories

04:39.920 --> 04:45.760
We've been covering in the unplugged program. And so I want to bring in our virtual log time appropriate greetings mama room

04:45.760 --> 04:47.760
Hello

04:49.560 --> 04:54.920
Hello now Popey, I hope you'll forgive me I got half of this of the mix, right?

04:54.920 --> 04:58.440
I've had a lot of beer today, but I didn't have any curry. There's a local brewery nearby

04:58.440 --> 05:01.180
I stopped by while I was prepping the show. They didn't serve curry though

05:01.180 --> 05:04.320
In fact when I asked them about curry, they looked at me like I was a crazy person

05:05.720 --> 05:10.320
Outrage I know I know so yeah, you'll have to forgive me. I didn't have any beer in Korea

05:10.320 --> 05:15.560
I just had the beer part, but it was lovely it is like it is almost 90 here at the studio today

05:15.560 --> 05:19.920
which means it's like five or seven or ten more degrees in the studio as we record and

05:20.360 --> 05:21.520
I was like

05:21.520 --> 05:26.400
I really really really really want to do an episode outside and my goal was to do episode 100

05:26.560 --> 05:28.960
As a meetup if possible and then holy crap

05:29.240 --> 05:34.480
Linux fest came up and and self came up and BSD gan came up and now OSCON's just a little bit of ways and

05:34.600 --> 05:36.920
episode 100 just snuck up on me

05:37.720 --> 05:38.800
but

05:38.800 --> 05:43.800
If you would if you're out there if you're listening to this episode and you're in the Pacific Northwest area and would like to come

05:43.800 --> 05:48.720
To the Jupiter broadcasting studio for episode 100 shoot me an email Chris at Jupiter broadcasting comm in cc

05:48.720 --> 05:52.840
Angela Jupiter broadcasting comm and for episode 100 we could do a mini meetup here in the studio

05:52.840 --> 05:57.040
It is an open invitation to any of you who'd like to join me next Tuesday around one o'clock

05:57.560 --> 05:59.920
Pacific time if you'd like to come in studio and hang out

06:00.360 --> 06:04.560
Join me just shoot an email Chris at Jupiter broadcasting comm and if enough of you show up

06:04.560 --> 06:09.880
I'll do some barbecuing maybe and also this week. Please forgive the air conditioner in the background

06:09.880 --> 06:14.160
It is hot in here. So why don't we start with OSCON?

06:14.160 --> 06:16.160
I just gave it kind of a mention and

06:16.240 --> 06:21.120
We're gonna be there the crew Noel is gonna be like a reduce crew. It's gonna be Noah and I we're gonna be getting clips

06:21.120 --> 06:27.920
For unplugged and Linux action show we'll be at OSCON on the 22nd OSCON itself runs July 20th through the 24th

06:27.920 --> 06:30.680
It's gonna be in Portland, Oregon. And here's the big bit

06:31.960 --> 06:34.880
It's the last OSCON in Portland. I know I

06:36.320 --> 06:38.160
Think they're moving to like, Texas

06:38.160 --> 06:40.120
But I'm a little sad

06:40.120 --> 06:44.360
Because you know, I can just take the train down to Portland, but I think it's a smart move

06:44.360 --> 06:47.600
They've spent a lot of time in Portland and Portland is an amazing area

06:47.680 --> 06:51.600
But Texas has really seen some serious development. And so it's good. It's a good opportunity

06:51.600 --> 06:56.200
I've been getting a lot of emails from listeners asking me to come down to the Texas area over

06:56.240 --> 07:01.960
Really? It's been ramping up over the last couple of years and now it's a steady drumbeat come down to Texas come down to Texas

07:01.960 --> 07:06.540
Come down to Texas. And so I think OSCON is also getting that same drumbeat and is responding

07:06.540 --> 07:10.300
So Noah and I were talking about this because we've enjoyed the fact that you know

07:10.300 --> 07:13.260
It's sort of like it's great to be able to these conventions that are in our backyard

07:13.260 --> 07:16.220
And when you can take a train ride down to Portland, how do you beat that?

07:17.860 --> 07:22.460
So we decided since this is gonna be the last OSCON in Portland going from the 20th to the 24th

07:22.780 --> 07:23.940
We're gonna have a little get-together

07:23.940 --> 07:29.140
We're gonna have a little party to celebrate it because this why not right because gives you folks in the Portland area

07:29.140 --> 07:31.660
Even if you're not going to OSCON a chance to catch up with us

07:31.660 --> 07:35.220
We'll talk Linux and open source about all the things that excite us. We'll get together

07:35.220 --> 07:39.820
We'll have some good food. And if you are gonna make it to OSCON, you can say hi to us at the conference

07:39.820 --> 07:42.440
We're gonna be there Wednesday, July 22nd

07:42.580 --> 07:47.560
We're gonna be there Wednesday, July 22nd, and then we're gonna go out to dinner at 5 p.m. Right now

07:48.060 --> 07:54.220
We have all the details at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting. We're gonna go to spirit of 77

07:54.220 --> 07:56.340
It's a bar that has a big area

07:56.340 --> 08:00.480
So if enough of you sign up at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for this one, I got it linked in the show notes

08:00.580 --> 08:02.500
We can reserve the top floor

08:02.500 --> 08:06.140
They have a dedicated area for large groups and it's just a handful of you are gonna make it

08:06.140 --> 08:09.740
Then we'll just hang out in the bar area down below either way. It's gonna work out great

08:09.740 --> 08:11.820
So our plan is on Wednesday

08:11.820 --> 08:18.060
July 22nd to be at OSCON in Portland Oregon at the exposition center got all the details on the meetup page and then we'll go

08:18.060 --> 08:20.060
out to dinner at 5 p.m

08:20.180 --> 08:21.940
And we'll be at

08:21.940 --> 08:25.740
Spirit of 77 now that may change those details may change the best way to stay informed

08:25.740 --> 08:29.980
That is be the meetup at the meetup page because if we get a bunch of you to go to the meetup page that are

08:29.980 --> 08:34.660
Under 21 we might want to change the location. That's why you need to go there and represent so we can let the

08:35.700 --> 08:37.140
Location know how many people are going to show up

08:37.140 --> 08:40.180
So let's go to OSCON if you're gonna be there use our promo code Linux

08:40.180 --> 08:43.500
You'll get a 20% discount on your ticket and let's have a party

08:43.500 --> 08:48.760
It'll be good to see all of you guys and it'll be a belated episode 100 celebration in the meantime

08:48.820 --> 08:53.660
You're welcome to show up here next week. Just shoot me an email Chris at Jupiter broadcasting.com show up in studio

08:53.660 --> 08:56.980
we'll hang out I got a mic you can chat about stuff and

08:56.980 --> 09:02.180
Maybe eat some barbecue Chris at Jupiterbroadcasting.com if you want to be here next week meetup.com

09:02.620 --> 09:09.020
Jupiter broadcasting if you want to join us for dinner while we're in Portland on the 22nd. How about all that?

09:09.020 --> 09:12.740
I'm really looking forward to all of that. It's it's good to get out especially when it's nice

09:12.740 --> 09:18.900
I want to get out and about maybe get a little physical activity in now. Mr. Corpse. Are you still listening?

09:18.900 --> 09:20.740
Come back if you're not in here

09:20.740 --> 09:24.980
And join us when you get a moment, Mr. Corpse come back into the mumble room because I want to talk about

09:24.980 --> 09:29.820
So OS solo s now remember we covered this a little bit ago the dame change

09:29.820 --> 09:33.420
We interviewed the developer and all of this and they have their first daily

09:33.420 --> 09:37.740
ISO available after all of their big transition all of their big work. This is the follow-up to that

09:37.780 --> 09:40.260
We have the results the fruits of that labor

09:40.260 --> 09:46.020
It's available now for you to go download and try it out that you have the bungee desktop featured right here in a nutshell

09:46.020 --> 09:48.740
It's built directly from the latest unstable development material

09:49.180 --> 09:52.660
now it's brand spanking new and it's available at the

09:52.660 --> 09:58.780
High high price of zero dollars, so you can go check it out. We'll have a link in the show notes. It's solo s

09:58.780 --> 10:01.500
s o l u s dash project comm

10:01.980 --> 10:04.300
They have their new daily iso, and I'm just excited

10:04.300 --> 10:07.460
I wanted to give them a little follow-up since we've been watching the project since they left mr.

10:07.460 --> 10:12.220
Corpse did you have any anything to add to the solo s release or anything from the project that you've heard?

10:14.180 --> 10:18.140
No, I mean I've used it and they're they're actually changing some kind dependencies with a

10:18.140 --> 10:25.380
With some like the gnome and GTK stuff they're doing. So they're actually moving to clutter. Oh, really is the base. Yeah

10:26.460 --> 10:32.220
I'm not sure exactly how like how much like they said they said that they were they their old dependency was limiting in them

10:32.220 --> 10:35.740
So they're going to change to clutter to be able to

10:36.300 --> 10:40.060
Benefit from the clutter development instead of doing it completely by themselves

10:40.060 --> 10:46.380
It's neat to see these these distros continue on and so I wanted to give them a brief mention since we did have them on the show

10:46.380 --> 10:50.300
Before and I love it's an interesting. It's another take on the gtk3 desktop

10:50.780 --> 10:56.140
It doesn't have you know, I think gtk3 and and gtk is I love the way those applications look

10:56.140 --> 10:58.220
I'm still a huge fan. I think cute cute is great, too

10:59.180 --> 11:03.500
But maybe you are not a huge fan of the way the gnome project has sort of moved forward

11:03.500 --> 11:06.940
You're not a huge fan of how they've implemented that vision and you'd like to see another take on it

11:07.980 --> 11:09.260
Check them out

11:09.260 --> 11:14.940
solo s dash project comm level link in the show notes and congrats to them for getting their first iso

11:14.940 --> 11:17.100
You know when they were on the show, they said they were going to do it

11:18.060 --> 11:20.060
but at that time it was um

11:20.620 --> 11:26.140
You know it was in the in the in the in the shadow of a big name change controversy a little bit of a little

11:26.140 --> 11:28.700
Bit of a mix up it seemed a little ambitious

11:28.700 --> 11:34.140
And so to hear that passion actually translate to an actual release is really cool to follow up on a few weeks later

11:34.460 --> 11:37.500
So check it out now. I got to tell you about something else that I want to follow up on

11:37.500 --> 11:42.940
That's our first sponsor this week digital ocean man. Has this been an amazing resource for jupiter broadcasting

11:42.940 --> 11:46.620
It started as a recommendation really as as as one of our hosts

11:46.860 --> 11:50.300
He said hey, you know i've been using this for my clients and it's a solid solution

11:50.540 --> 11:55.100
I'm using them so much. I want to talk about it in the show all the time. Maybe they'd make a good sponsor

11:56.220 --> 12:00.620
Man was mr. Dominic right digital ocean is perfect for the jupiter broadcasting audience

12:00.620 --> 12:06.620
First of all, let's start with the fact that their entire infrastructure is built on linux powered by the best virtualizer out there kvm

12:07.260 --> 12:12.140
That's right. Digital ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy to use

12:12.140 --> 12:14.860
intuitive and easy way to spin up your own cloud server

12:15.020 --> 12:18.780
Now, what does that really mean? That means you can go get a linux rig up in the cloud now

12:18.780 --> 12:21.340
What's the cloud that's somebody else's computer in this case?

12:21.420 --> 12:28.460
It's digital oceans computers the best data centers in the world with the best ios the all ssd infrastructure running on top of linux

12:28.700 --> 12:34.140
Yeah, that's the route i'm gonna take thanks and you can get started in less than 55 seconds and pricing plans start only

12:34.620 --> 12:38.780
Five dollars a month. That's less than one trip to mcdonald's for the entire month or starbucks

12:38.780 --> 12:44.460
Really? I pay for more than that in a couple of energy drinks and it's five dollars for the entire month

12:44.540 --> 12:50.560
And then I get you 512 megabytes of ram a 20 gigabyte ssd one cpu and a terabyte of transfer a terabyte

12:53.740 --> 12:57.740
Digital ocean has really got this figured out. So they decided okay, we're gonna go ssd only

12:58.460 --> 13:04.220
We're gonna base it on linux and kvm and then there's gonna be these technologies that we're gonna work really closely with

13:04.840 --> 13:05.900
fedora

13:05.900 --> 13:06.940
Yeah

13:06.940 --> 13:09.420
Core os free bsd docker, right?

13:09.660 --> 13:14.860
They work directly upstream with these projects to make sure they can integrate it at the base level with the digital ocean platform

13:15.100 --> 13:22.460
And I love that because they are really contributing back or another example is they there's projects that don't even directly impact them

13:22.860 --> 13:25.660
But they feel are important to open source. So they invest there

13:26.200 --> 13:33.020
Elementary os is moving off of source port source forge because digital ocean is donating the bandwidth to make hosting free for them

13:33.020 --> 13:39.500
So is ghost they're getting off the source for ghost is an amazing blogging platform that i'm recommending to people all the time small businesses

13:39.820 --> 13:42.380
And people just want to have their own personal blog check out ghost

13:43.180 --> 13:46.140
And now they're able to get away from source forge. Thanks to digital ocean

13:46.460 --> 13:50.140
They didn't have to do that. That doesn't sell more vpss for digital ocean

13:50.300 --> 13:53.420
They did that because that's the right thing for open source. That's awesome

13:53.420 --> 13:57.340
You guys that's why they built the entire infrastructure on open source because they get it

13:58.060 --> 14:00.860
And man is their interface amazing super intuitive

14:00.860 --> 14:07.420
And you can replicate the functionality of their control panel with their really fantastic api. They've recently revved it and it's better than ever

14:07.980 --> 14:08.780
it's

14:08.780 --> 14:11.260
Maybe even a great one to cut your teeth on if you want to do a little programming

14:11.580 --> 14:16.060
And the best part is if you're never going to get to that point where you're going to do any development around their api

14:16.700 --> 14:21.980
Their community has created so many fantastic applications ones that will integrate into your linux desktop

14:22.140 --> 14:29.340
There are ppas available for ubuntu. There are applications in the arch user repository for managing your digital ocean droplets right out of the box

14:29.340 --> 14:31.340
Managing your digital ocean droplets right now

14:31.420 --> 14:36.780
You could integrate it into your existing lifestyle because there's ios and android apps today that all take advantage of this api

14:36.940 --> 14:41.580
It's that good. It's really a nice system and it's all starting at five dollars a month

14:41.740 --> 14:46.780
Go over to digital ocean.com. But here is the best part use our promo code do unplugged

14:46.780 --> 14:48.780
That's one word lowercase do unplugged

14:48.860 --> 14:53.820
You'll get a ten dollar credit with that ten dollar credit. You try out that five dollar rigs two months two months

14:54.460 --> 14:56.300
two months

14:56.300 --> 14:58.300
Absolutely free

14:58.300 --> 15:00.460
What a great opportunity to play with core os

15:01.980 --> 15:06.960
Have you heard about freebsd how it's a cohesive system about how it has ports about how it has great documentation

15:07.420 --> 15:10.060
Is that legit? Is it the right technology for your business?

15:10.780 --> 15:13.740
Try it out on digital ocean droplet two months absolutely for free

15:14.380 --> 15:16.380

15:22.540 --> 15:27.260
Out on a public ip with incredible bandwidth and a fantastic performance

15:27.260 --> 15:33.820
Digital ocean.com use the promo code do unplugged seriously from testing to production to learning

15:34.140 --> 15:38.540
Digital ocean has got it covered digital ocean.com do unplugged and a big. Thank you digital ocean for sponsoring

15:39.340 --> 15:41.340
the linux unplugged program

15:41.420 --> 15:43.100
Check it out

15:43.100 --> 15:43.500
All right

15:43.500 --> 15:48.140
So, uh, let's cover a couple more things before we get into the topic that i'm really really really itching to talk to you

15:48.140 --> 15:50.300
Guys about but I want to give a nod to the mint

15:50.300 --> 15:56.860
Mint project linux mint 17.2 cinnamon edition has been released and it came out today

15:57.260 --> 15:59.660
I don't have any current plans to review it

15:59.660 --> 16:03.580
But that may change one of the things that's interesting about this release is it's supported until

16:04.600 --> 16:06.600
2019

16:07.240 --> 16:09.240
2019

16:09.340 --> 16:12.220
I wonder how they do that probably some sort of uh, i'm sure they just

16:12.220 --> 16:19.100
That's probably some sort of magic, uh, so i've talked about 14.04. Yeah, I know I know I that was that was the joke

16:19.580 --> 16:21.500
Thank you. Thank you. Nice

16:21.500 --> 16:29.180
Uh, so lots of improvements to cinnamon. I mean, this is really a uh, performance improvement to cinnamon multi-monitor support has been improved

16:29.900 --> 16:37.180
Lots of cleanup and performance. Um, I don't really have a lot to add here in my opinion the bigger story about mint

16:37.180 --> 16:42.060
And I mean no disrespect to the project because I think this is a totally valid track to take

16:43.180 --> 16:45.900
The most interesting thing about mint is that it's getting boring

16:49.660 --> 16:52.860
I mean really though like it. Uh, it's got it's

16:54.940 --> 17:00.860
You know, it's like the good stuff about ubuntu with some more modern desktop takes on it and some refinements

17:01.660 --> 17:03.660
And it's fine

17:03.820 --> 17:05.820
it works good and it's exactly like

17:05.820 --> 17:11.020
it continues to be a great option for a lot of people I just

17:13.180 --> 17:15.180
The more it goes down this path

17:15.580 --> 17:19.020
The less and less it appeals to me when mint started

17:19.580 --> 17:25.500
It was ubuntu plus codecs and other nice things. It was it was all the stuff you did to ubuntu

17:26.620 --> 17:30.700
Already done for you in a really tasteful clean well-designed way

17:30.700 --> 17:35.660
And then as it moved forward it stayed along that path and it deviated and cinnamon came up and mattei came up and these things

17:35.820 --> 17:40.860
Came up was but they still kind of made sense for the overall. It's ubuntu

17:41.420 --> 17:43.420
but better

17:44.300 --> 17:47.900
I I think it's it's still that but uh, I

17:48.940 --> 17:50.940
I don't know. I mean

17:50.940 --> 17:54.300
For some reason as it's gone down more of the tried and true path

17:54.860 --> 17:58.780
And it and it and it's not pushing. It's almost like it's gotten a little tired

17:58.780 --> 18:02.300
Like mint's a little tired right now, and it doesn't want to push the edges anymore

18:03.100 --> 18:08.140
It just wants to continue to build what it knows to be good the world that it's created continues to be okay

18:08.380 --> 18:10.380
And it wants to refine and iterate on that

18:10.940 --> 18:12.700
And I think maybe

18:12.700 --> 18:14.700
That's not all that appealing to me

18:14.700 --> 18:16.700
Mumble room. What are your thoughts?

18:16.700 --> 18:21.660
So my perspective on this is mint as my understanding when I used it

18:21.820 --> 18:26.780
Was that they do take a lot of the feedback from the community and what the community team's

18:26.780 --> 18:30.540
What the community team's important as like the first thing to be solved

18:31.180 --> 18:37.180
and I can tell you that uh, you could pretty much complain in the irc quote unquote and

18:37.660 --> 18:43.180
See results in the next week or in the next release about what you just complained. So maybe

18:44.140 --> 18:52.060
The stagnation comes from a type of user base that wants some consolidation in some aspects and because they are doing something slightly different

18:52.060 --> 18:57.660
And perhaps they're stretching a little bit on what they can actually do and so they're just trying to focus that on a little

18:57.660 --> 19:01.260
While until they develop the new concept and it's ready enough to roll out

19:01.740 --> 19:04.940
So and so I wanted to give you a chance to jump in too

19:06.300 --> 19:08.300
um, so speaking of of

19:08.460 --> 19:12.620
Linux mint in 17.2 one of the things that they implemented for the cinnamon desktop

19:13.160 --> 19:17.580
2.6 is making it better accessible for those with visual impairments and blind users

19:17.580 --> 19:23.980
So it's um, it's begun work. There's still some some work to be done, but it's it's getting it's going in the right direction

19:24.860 --> 19:29.420
Yeah, I agree now poppy maybe you know, uh, let's let's look at uh

19:29.500 --> 19:33.180
There was a really cool video of mere eight and the new tasks which are coming out

19:33.260 --> 19:36.540
A lot of changes are coming boring could be good, right?

19:37.900 --> 19:45.500
Well, you know your perspective your opening gambit with this was mint's become boring and uh, not really interested in that anymore

19:45.500 --> 19:48.060
But for me for me, i'm sure it's valid for lots of people

19:49.100 --> 19:52.140
Right, but you said that was a good thing for me

19:52.220 --> 19:57.820
You said that the the fact that linux mint has got to that stage where it's now boring and it's putting out boring releases

19:58.140 --> 20:00.300
Is a good thing for linux mint yet?

20:01.100 --> 20:05.740
The most recent once you release you I don't actually think it is a good thing because it was boring

20:05.820 --> 20:11.180
I I actually do anything exciting. I actually would argue. No, I I think maybe you're mischaracterizing

20:11.180 --> 20:15.500
I I don't actually think long term. This is a good thing for mint. I think long term

20:15.820 --> 20:17.500
This is a sign that mint is tired

20:17.500 --> 20:23.420
This is a sign that mint isn't going to truly innovate much more and that mint is building out its its base its world

20:23.500 --> 20:25.740
It's its island its embassy

20:26.460 --> 20:31.900
And I think when you say that's going to make it isn't going to innovate anymore. What what like truly innovative things?

20:31.980 --> 20:33.980
They've they've added a backup tool. Yeah

20:34.780 --> 20:36.220
I mean I understand

20:36.220 --> 20:39.980
Yeah, okay. All right. Okay. I understand your inclination to downplay what they've done

20:39.980 --> 20:43.420
But then I think if you know, I'm not I'm not downplaying what they've done. I'm just saying

20:44.300 --> 20:47.420
I can't reconcile the fact that you say boring is

20:48.060 --> 20:51.740
Is bad for mint? Well, come on now you're arguing two things. Which one do you want to argue here?

20:51.900 --> 20:54.620
Let's say let's say I I I don't think boring is good for mint

20:54.780 --> 20:56.700
I think long term boring is bad for mint

20:56.860 --> 20:59.820
I think the more people in my audience to stop caring about mint

21:00.140 --> 21:05.420
The more people long term that stop getting referred to mint the more momentum over long time that lament loses

21:05.660 --> 21:07.740
And eventually mint sort of goes into obscurity

21:07.740 --> 21:09.900
I think the stability is good

21:09.900 --> 21:14.220
a lot of people want something that isn't going to throw a new desktop at them something that isn't going to

21:14.540 --> 21:20.060
Move things around and yeah and something that they know that they can upgrade and they'll get the latest push and lever office

21:20.060 --> 21:22.700
The latest kernel the latest this and that the latest toolkits

21:23.260 --> 21:26.460
The latest mate or cinnamon or whatever they choose they get all that latest stuff

21:26.700 --> 21:30.620
But they know that when they boot the machine up the next day, it's going to look exactly the same as it did yesterday

21:30.620 --> 21:37.820
Yeah, absolutely little polish. Yeah, and you know a lot of people who want that. Yeah, and those people buy macs and windows

21:39.100 --> 21:41.900
But I think the important thing is that to show the user

21:42.460 --> 21:43.420
um

21:43.420 --> 21:45.420
How how to use their computer, right?

21:45.500 --> 21:48.300
So they don't want to they don't want a desktop to always be changing

21:48.620 --> 21:54.220
They want a desktop to kind of stay stagnant for a little while and I mean what what what if a desktop changes every week?

21:54.300 --> 21:55.580
or every month

21:55.580 --> 21:59.180
That's kind of kind of kind of put a wrench in the user now. Let's come on now. Come on now

21:59.180 --> 22:03.980
Let's have a rational serious discussion about this and not let's not argue the outlier scenarios

22:04.140 --> 22:09.260
Here's the reality if you're a consumer who values stability and long-term support you're going to buy it

22:09.340 --> 22:13.180
You're going to buy windows or macos because those that's what the reputation is. Come on. Let's be honest

22:13.500 --> 22:18.080
If you're a linux user, then you know about things like rel you know about things like ubuntu lts

22:18.380 --> 22:20.780
You you understand this game you're already in here

22:21.100 --> 22:26.060
I think sometimes what we get caught up in is we pretend like we're marketing to some sort of pretend user

22:26.060 --> 22:29.580
Who's never going to be a linux user at least not this generation around?

22:29.740 --> 22:34.140
And so what we do is we get caught up on designing these systems that are amazing for this person

22:34.380 --> 22:40.220
That doesn't actually exist because in in reality those people buy based on brand loyalty

22:40.540 --> 22:47.020
That's what it comes down to what brand do I trust? I trust dell. I trust hp. I trust apple. I trust microsoft

22:47.260 --> 22:51.420
I trust best buy. I don't trust mint. I don't know what the hell that is

22:51.660 --> 22:53.900
I don't know what a mint box is. I don't trust that

22:53.900 --> 22:57.260
I don't buy that if I want stability if I want something that's going to work for five years

22:57.420 --> 23:01.420
I don't buy that I buy a computer that gets windows 10 or I buy a macintosh

23:01.660 --> 23:05.500
And that's the reality and we can all pretend like that's not the reality because it makes us feel better

23:05.740 --> 23:09.020
But the truth of the matter is the market tells us that's the reality

23:09.180 --> 23:16.060
So that what we have to acknowledge is there is a certain demographic that uses the linux desktop in mass. That's developers. That's enthusiasts

23:16.140 --> 23:21.820
That's technical people. That's advocates. That's us. That's this audience and for those people mint is boring

23:21.820 --> 23:29.740
And those are the people that like like noah who buy laptops and ssds to convert people because that's the reality of where we're at

23:29.740 --> 23:35.660
Right now those people will be the people that recommend things like abutu and mint and there's only so many people

23:35.660 --> 23:39.500
They're going to continue to recommend a distribution that is basically tired and sleepy

23:40.940 --> 23:47.820
Why do you think I would actually do this more just because they're stagnant because you know, I don't have to maintain that too much

23:47.820 --> 23:52.300
I think people would use people who

23:53.900 --> 23:59.260
Get help from noah are using ubuntu are using mint not because they trust the brand

23:59.740 --> 24:03.820
They do it because they trust noah and that's how it's been for a very long

24:03.900 --> 24:08.620
Noah and altus speed is a brand. I mean rethink about the way you think about brands

24:09.100 --> 24:13.580
Noah is a brand to his clients. His company is a brand and they trust that brand

24:13.580 --> 24:20.060
So noah can give them this thing called ubuntu that they've never heard about because they trust brand noah, right?

24:20.140 --> 24:22.620
They're not trusting ubuntu when he gives them an ubuntu laptop

24:22.620 --> 24:25.660
Just like they're not trusting linux mint and if they didn't have noah

24:25.900 --> 24:29.740
They would buy something that's a mac or they would buy something that runs windows plain and simple

24:31.260 --> 24:37.660
Well, okay, I agree with that completely but this I guess puts the weight on

24:38.380 --> 24:40.380
our shoulders because we

24:40.380 --> 24:44.320
are technically because mint is not trying to push a brand

24:45.120 --> 24:50.960
And make mint be the next big big thing. They are just trying to make the best operating system

24:51.120 --> 24:53.280
That's the most user friendly, right?

24:53.360 --> 24:58.880
Right, which means sometimes the releases will get boring because they need to focus on bug fixing

24:59.360 --> 25:05.280
Rather than adding features, right? But this puts the weight on our shoulders to be the brand so

25:05.280 --> 25:12.160
Uh people who I recommend ubuntu or mint to they will trust me that this will work

25:12.240 --> 25:14.000
I think and I want to make this clear

25:14.000 --> 25:20.320
I think long term it is not a sustainable course for a distribution be it ubuntu or mint to be boring

25:20.560 --> 25:22.240
I think short term

25:22.240 --> 25:28.740
It is extremely prudent to have a boring arm of your distribution and maybe to have the primary focus of your distribution

25:29.040 --> 25:32.880
To be known as stable and boring because linux itself is undergoing

25:32.880 --> 25:37.760
We're about to talk about a rumor coming up that could fundamentally change the way video is routed under linux, right?

25:38.080 --> 25:43.440
Linux itself is going under a lot of changes systemd containers butter fs

25:44.480 --> 25:49.920
And then on the ubuntu side the biggest desktop distribution out there the conversion to unity 8 and mere and all of this

25:50.240 --> 25:55.280
Is the biggest amount of change we have ever witnessed at one time under the linux desktop

25:55.520 --> 26:00.740
And so it makes a lot of sense for the market to respond by having these distributions

26:00.740 --> 26:04.420
That are sort of a safe refuge from all of that

26:04.580 --> 26:11.700
But I think they will meet a time there will come a time when unity 8 or unity 9 is pretty effing solid, right?

26:11.860 --> 26:16.340
And containers are the way we're distributing software and there's all these things that have caught up and snapshots

26:16.420 --> 26:19.060
Are part of your kernel update because you're using butter fs everywhere

26:19.220 --> 26:24.420
There's all these developments are going to crop up faster than we expect them to and these distributions are going to look like

26:24.800 --> 26:29.540
1990s technologies and they're going to have to realize that they have stuck in an old way of doing things

26:29.540 --> 26:32.820
And they're going to have to find a way to modernize and the funny thing is

26:33.060 --> 26:35.460
Is the one that all of them are looking to is ubuntu?

26:35.620 --> 26:41.140
And it's the one that outwardly with its lts releases and and it's very boring unity releases for many releases

26:41.220 --> 26:43.940
Now is the one champion a boring release is okay

26:44.260 --> 26:49.220
And then they're the ones they are going to be the very ones that do the switcheroo on us and be like boom

26:49.460 --> 26:53.380
Everything new is great use the new stuff new is good innovation is good

26:53.780 --> 26:58.660
Everybody go this direction and the entire focus is going to change on all of us and distributions like mid

26:58.660 --> 27:02.420
They're gonna be like wait a minute. I thought I thought stole old stable and tired and true was good

27:02.660 --> 27:05.700
And it's all going to change out from underneath them and then when that happens

27:06.260 --> 27:11.220
Their stability and their boringness is going to become a detriment to them and no longer their primary market advantage

27:11.380 --> 27:13.380
They have a temporary market advantage today

27:13.540 --> 27:18.100
But they need to be looking forward to the future because it's all going to change I believe a year or two down the road

27:19.140 --> 27:22.900
Well, except for men already established that they're going to be continuing with more lts

27:22.900 --> 27:26.260
They're not going to stick to 1404. They're going to go to 1604 as well

27:26.260 --> 27:30.500
So they're going to get the new technology. They're just doing it in two year cycle instead of a six month cycle

27:30.580 --> 27:33.140
I think it's I don't think that'll work long term. I think it'll work now

27:34.820 --> 27:37.940
You know what I think we are running into this

27:38.740 --> 27:42.360
The same issue that node was in as node.js

27:43.060 --> 27:50.740
Um for a while now is that when node.js was new and they were just adding features constantly people were complaining

27:50.900 --> 27:55.220
Oh, we can't use this in production because with every other there are too many changes

27:55.220 --> 28:01.860
So they slowed down as the uh industry wanted and they slowed down the production that

28:02.660 --> 28:06.180
adding features and focused on fixing bugs and

28:06.980 --> 28:12.100
It was kind of more sustained for production and then people started complaining

28:12.180 --> 28:18.900
Oh, no, we want faster development and more features and they had a fork and io.js was made and

28:19.620 --> 28:23.540
That didn't work either and now they merged together and we have node and

28:23.540 --> 28:25.140
uh

28:25.140 --> 28:26.420
io

28:26.420 --> 28:33.140
Merging to a single project right and like there is no perfect solution to this that will work for everyone

28:33.540 --> 28:35.940
it's about finding balance, but this is

28:36.740 --> 28:39.140
not just about finding balance for

28:40.820 --> 28:43.620
Users or and but also

28:44.340 --> 28:47.460
about finding balance for developers, right because

28:47.460 --> 28:54.120
Because developers can put themselves in a situation where they keep adding features with every release

28:54.680 --> 29:00.840
And now they have a backlog of you know, 24 months of the feature development

29:01.480 --> 29:03.880
And no bug fixes, right? So

29:05.720 --> 29:12.040
This means that once in a while you will have to focus on fixing bugs and have a few boring releases

29:12.520 --> 29:16.440
I actually I you know the the chaos of all of this is

29:16.440 --> 29:18.440
Is the best part, right?

29:18.520 --> 29:22.520
Uh it to me in a way knowing that this is all going in a certain direction

29:22.520 --> 29:23.640
but today

29:23.640 --> 29:30.360
Revelling in the in the in all of the different approaches and all of the different actually very valid ideas and reasonings

29:30.760 --> 29:34.680
Is is sort of awesome. Uh, I I find it to be sort of like

29:35.640 --> 29:37.560
When you when you are in the thick of it

29:37.560 --> 29:40.120
It is perhaps a bit maddening but when you zoom out

29:40.200 --> 29:44.840
It's it seems so obvious and almost intentional in the long run, uh rotten corpse

29:44.840 --> 29:49.080
I want to give you a chance to say to sort of go at my windows comparison here

29:50.120 --> 29:55.800
Yeah, I was just going to say that the windows and mac thing about this where people buy because they just they're they're picking a brand

29:56.280 --> 30:01.720
They probably don't really care they're looking at money and if or they're looking at their hatred of windows. So

30:02.440 --> 30:04.200
I don't know man

30:04.200 --> 30:09.160
I think people are I think the general user is afraid of technology and I think brands help them make a decision

30:09.400 --> 30:11.960
In the lack of other other information to proceed with

30:11.960 --> 30:14.760
Sure, but with with windows, they don't really make that decision

30:14.760 --> 30:21.560
Anyway, even now they contact someone they know that knows computers because they don't know the difference between this dell laptop or this acer laptop

30:21.560 --> 30:24.120
Or this other acer laptop and so on. So

30:24.680 --> 30:29.080
But my point is is that the the linux thing the reason why we're people not buying linux is because

30:29.880 --> 30:35.000
Either you have no option at all or you have a laptop that's ridiculously overpriced

30:35.320 --> 30:39.320
Like their libram, which is like fifteen hundred dollars or something. No, no one's gonna do that

30:39.320 --> 30:45.400
But no one who's like in that field, I mean, but for now as of like what two months ago

30:45.400 --> 30:52.920
There's now that dell laptop is 250. That's a perfectly reasonable price that anybody who doesn't really know anything about it could totally buy

30:53.240 --> 30:58.840
Yeah, yeah, and and uh, and I agree, uh that that's a good start. Um, go ahead sunsel

30:58.840 --> 31:00.840
You want to come in also about the brands thing?

31:01.720 --> 31:06.920
Yeah, just to add on to what robin corpse is like most people don't even know what linux is

31:06.920 --> 31:13.080
And you can now unless you're in the you know, the the tech area or you you you're you use it and you you recommend it

31:13.080 --> 31:15.080
To your friends and family or whatever

31:15.080 --> 31:15.560
Yeah

31:15.560 --> 31:19.960
But other people who don't live in this sphere that we live in a lot of people don't know what linux is

31:19.960 --> 31:24.840
Like for example, like in my school. I mentioned linux to people like what is that? Is that a terminal?

31:24.840 --> 31:26.840
Is that is that just a black window with words?

31:26.840 --> 31:32.280
That's if you want if you want any if you want to just that's why it's I mean, that's why it's called chrome os

31:32.280 --> 31:38.920
That's why it's called chromecast not linux cast not linux os on the chromebook. It's not called the linux book

31:39.160 --> 31:43.880
It's called the chromebook. It's not called it's not called linux a mobile. It's called android

31:45.240 --> 31:46.120
Right

31:46.120 --> 31:50.920
People just don't you know know what's going on and I think if people were more aware or kind of what?

31:51.240 --> 31:54.200
Or they want to be more aware. I think that would kind of help the issue

31:54.280 --> 31:58.760
See and this is the this is where uh, I don't think this is ever ever ever going to change

31:58.760 --> 32:02.920
And maybe it's because i've been doing the linux action show for nine years and it's never changed in that nine years

32:02.920 --> 32:06.920
Maybe it's because linus torvald said that linux is successful when people don't know they're using linux

32:07.160 --> 32:10.760
and so it's even at the very top of linux and maybe it's because um

32:11.640 --> 32:16.760
Companies are motivated to brand things as their very own even even when that company is a company like canonical

32:17.000 --> 32:19.480
They want to brand it as their own and not call it linux

32:19.480 --> 32:21.480
They want to call it a bunt or they want to call it android

32:21.800 --> 32:25.240
This is the natural inclination of the commercial entities that are involved with linux

32:25.240 --> 32:31.560
So maybe it's one of those three reasons I think the community and I think the public at large will never ever ever ever ever

32:31.640 --> 32:37.720
Except linux as a brand as anything but a technical thing because these three major interests it is in their best interest

32:38.040 --> 32:44.600
To rebrand these things to rebrand these technologies to own these technologies to make them look bigger and better and to be honest

32:45.560 --> 32:48.920
Open source makes that possible. It's kind of the beautiful thing about it

32:48.920 --> 32:55.880
Is it is a general technology enabling platform that allows people to create products services and all kinds of other things around it

32:56.040 --> 33:01.320
And so people like google and people like all other companies like samsung can take it and call whatever they can call it tyson

33:01.320 --> 33:03.320
They don't have to call it linux

33:04.120 --> 33:07.400
Well, but that means that the general public is never going to trust the name linux

33:07.640 --> 33:15.160
And so we cannot expect that things like linux mint are ever going to be applicable to an average user. That is a bullshit fantasy

33:15.160 --> 33:17.160
That's why I call it mint and not linux man

33:17.720 --> 33:25.160
Well, yeah, well, let's let's let's let's pause this for a second if you were to actually make money off of something called

33:25.720 --> 33:27.000
linux

33:27.000 --> 33:31.340
Wouldn't you then have to apply for use of the trademarked?

33:32.040 --> 33:33.000
linux

33:33.000 --> 33:38.520
Name, yeah, that's all foundation. Yes. Yeah, this makes it a lot more complicated because you can call it

33:38.520 --> 33:44.360
linux, whatever like if you are not making money off of it, i'm guessing it's fine, but

33:45.240 --> 33:48.680
Linux as far as I know is a trademark that you're right foundation

33:49.240 --> 33:54.840
Correct, correct. And so it's in those companies best interest not to use a trademark name even exactly. Yeah

33:55.960 --> 34:00.120
So it's never going to happen. It's never going to be a generally public thing, but you know what?

34:00.600 --> 34:06.120
That's okay, because linux doesn't need that that gives that gives other platforms like ubuntu like github

34:06.120 --> 34:11.000
That gives other platforms like ubuntu like android a chance to shine and then that gives us

34:11.880 --> 34:17.000
The knowledge of knowing well linux powers all these things so become an expert in linux and you understand all of these things

34:17.080 --> 34:18.680
I mean, it's a good thing

34:18.680 --> 34:20.680
If we take ego out of it

34:21.400 --> 34:22.840
But see we have ego

34:22.840 --> 34:28.920
All wrapped up in this because we want to convince other people to use the technology that we use we want to advocate for it

34:28.920 --> 34:33.560
So we want things like linux mint because that gives us the idea that we could advocate to average users

34:33.560 --> 34:37.160
They could use this and so we hold it up there as this iconic idea

34:37.400 --> 34:44.600
The average person coming over because in reality it makes us feel better. But the truth is that's not how it's going to work

34:45.880 --> 34:50.520
I just want to make that point mention. That's why that's why that's my super sorry not to interrupt you rotten

34:50.680 --> 34:53.000
But I just want to complete my thoughts so it doesn't sound like i'm just rambling

34:53.240 --> 34:55.320
That's why it's my super long answer to poppy

34:55.640 --> 34:58.840
Why I think it's not necessarily long term a good idea for it to be boring

34:59.080 --> 35:02.440
Because I think if you're honest about who the market is here

35:02.440 --> 35:04.440
It's people that listen to this show

35:05.320 --> 35:08.200
Honestly and what they're going to recommend and they're going to recommend

35:09.880 --> 35:16.440
Things that excite them things that to them seem like an idea that has momentum things to them that seem like have a future

35:16.760 --> 35:22.680
Seem to definitely not. Yes. Yes. Absolutely. I'm not i'm not saying i'm not saying rolling but seem

35:22.760 --> 35:24.760
But things that feel like they're going to be around for a while

35:24.840 --> 35:29.880
Always recommended boring this shows that could be l that could be why couldn't that be a bunch of matte?

35:30.040 --> 35:32.040
Why can't that be a bunch of matte?

35:32.040 --> 35:36.440
I don't want to explain to someone once some icon moved to some other

35:37.160 --> 35:41.160
Place in the menu and they can't find it anymore with boring this shows

35:41.240 --> 35:45.160
You know if some icon is in one place and if you want to go to settings

35:45.240 --> 35:51.240
It will always be the same spot because that's what boring this shows do don't listen is sometimes good

35:51.560 --> 35:55.560
Don't misinterpret my words for advocating rolling release for everybody. That's not what i'm saying

35:55.640 --> 35:58.200
I'm saying there's distributions out there like today

35:58.200 --> 36:05.640
There's distributions out there like ubuntu 1404 and ubuntu matte and and mint and they are serving a purpose today

36:07.880 --> 36:09.400
Today

36:09.400 --> 36:13.400
Today and i'm not i'm not trying to discourage anybody from using them today

36:14.760 --> 36:18.600
See, here's the thing. I stopped this is not even about rolling

36:18.680 --> 36:23.080
I stopped recommending ubuntu to people when unity first came out just because

36:23.080 --> 36:27.640
Because things were moving around and I know this is always the issue

36:27.720 --> 36:33.560
It's not an issue for me because I always can do things through the terminal. I don't care where the icons are, right?

36:33.800 --> 36:35.800
But for a lot of users

36:36.520 --> 36:38.440
Some icon

36:38.440 --> 36:40.360
Being moved somewhere else

36:40.360 --> 36:48.120
It's a big deal because now they will spend five minutes looking for it. Yeah, and it's it's frustrating. So I recommend this shows that are

36:48.920 --> 36:50.920
By many in this community

36:50.920 --> 36:56.280
Considered boring now. I want to give daredevil in the final thought and uh, because i'm happy to uh,

36:56.280 --> 37:01.960
i'm happy to just put my thoughts in episode 99 and I will replay this clip in two three years and uh,

37:02.280 --> 37:07.240
And see where things stand now, but uh daredevil you wanted to uh get a point in so i'll let you have our closing thought

37:08.280 --> 37:12.440
So apparently they are selling mint boxes and they have their user base

37:12.600 --> 37:18.840
They are one of the few distributions that has a system to get feedback from the users and do

37:18.840 --> 37:24.360
Like there is that even the other users can see the feedback because just the software center alone

37:24.520 --> 37:27.480
That has the ratings and the comments you can have a perception

37:27.800 --> 37:31.800
Just by using the system of what is changing or what where people want change

37:32.120 --> 37:36.200
So from those things I think mint has enough data to make their own decisions

37:36.520 --> 37:40.680
I think it's too much of us to say that it's boring or it's not going to be good

37:41.000 --> 37:47.880
Just based on what we're seeing as not using the distro because apparently they have other things going on that we're just not aware of

37:47.880 --> 37:49.880
Just yet. I mean

37:51.640 --> 37:55.640
How much are they selling off mint boxes which type of users are acquiring these mint boxes

37:55.800 --> 37:59.560
Why are these companies deciding to partnership to make mint boxes in the first place?

37:59.960 --> 38:02.520
So all of this information might actually be

38:03.540 --> 38:09.560
Contraproductive to what are we are saying right here right now just because we don't know how that's going on. Hmm. I don't know

38:10.440 --> 38:15.880
I uh, I I think the uh, I think the evidence is in the fact that canonical refelt refocused on the desktop

38:15.880 --> 38:19.800
And I refocused on mobile and gave up on the desktop even though there's vendors out there shipping it

38:19.800 --> 38:24.920
But i'll you know what i'll leave it at this uh linux action show at reddit.com. We'll have a feedback thread for 99

38:25.320 --> 38:27.320
Let me know your thoughts. I think

38:27.880 --> 38:31.720
It is uh, I think it's a great release. I think the guys like clem

38:31.800 --> 38:35.640
I think he is one of the most respectable people in the open source community

38:35.960 --> 38:40.360
And I think the mint project is one of the most respectable distributions. It's a classy distribution

38:40.680 --> 38:44.120
I think what they're focusing on right now is exactly what the community needs right now

38:44.120 --> 38:48.120
And I bet if anybody like clem is clever enough as the tide turns down the future

38:48.120 --> 38:50.360
Like I think it will clem is clever enough to turn with it

38:50.520 --> 38:54.760
I don't think the mint project is any long-term risk. I just don't think it excites me right now

38:54.760 --> 38:56.680
I don't find it particularly compelling

38:56.680 --> 39:01.560
And I wouldn't be too surprised to find that to be the audience of or the opinion of most of our audience

39:01.640 --> 39:03.240
But maybe i'm wrong

39:03.240 --> 39:07.880
I want to talk about our sponsor first and then we'll get into the topic that I think is maybe the biggest deal of the week

39:08.040 --> 39:10.040
It's not strictly even linux related

39:10.040 --> 39:15.240
Um, yeah, no, well, no, it's not strictly linux related, but it probably impacts all of us

39:15.880 --> 39:20.360
So, uh, I want to uh, take a minute though and talk about ting go to linux.ting.com

39:21.000 --> 39:25.080
Linux.ting.com to support this show and boy today's the last day

39:25.160 --> 39:28.040
So if you're listening right now and you've been on the fence about ting

39:28.600 --> 39:31.320
Make the move. Here's how I would make the decision to be honest

39:31.400 --> 39:35.960
You just got to go with your gut but go to linux.ting.com and then click that savings calculator

39:36.840 --> 39:38.840
Here's the difference about ting

39:38.840 --> 39:42.440
You only pay for what you use. It's a flat six dollars

39:43.080 --> 39:47.400
It's tax and then your usage on top of that your minutes your messages your megabytes ting adds them all up

39:47.400 --> 39:49.240
That's what you pay for

39:49.240 --> 39:52.280
And they have a gsm network and a cdma network. They're huge

39:53.560 --> 39:59.800
So that means if you get a device that's good like a nexus 5 or any complement complement, you know any device any nexus

40:00.520 --> 40:01.560
Well, I would go with the nexus 5

40:01.560 --> 40:07.080
But really any android device is dual sim or any any gsm any device that has cdma and gsm sims in it

40:07.080 --> 40:11.720
Then you have the flexibility of moving between cdma and gsm

40:12.360 --> 40:16.920
Now for me, that's particularly appealing because I attend conferences. I want to go on road trips

40:16.920 --> 40:19.720
I like the idea of picking the network. That's the strongest

40:20.360 --> 40:23.800
But maybe you have really strong gsm or cdma and you can just pick a single phone

40:23.800 --> 40:27.080
You have a lot of flexibility with ting and as power users

40:27.720 --> 40:33.640
Having those kinds of flexibility those kinds of options is really nice and not only does ting have no whole customer service

40:33.640 --> 40:37.160
So you're not going to get stuck in a call queue in a call tree

40:37.880 --> 40:41.480
Which we know we've got more we've got better things to do than play than play that game

40:42.600 --> 40:45.880
You call them right now call them right now 1855 ting ftw

40:46.280 --> 40:51.720
If you're listening live you could call them right now because they they have they have no whole customer service during business hours on the east

40:51.720 --> 40:52.760
coast

40:52.760 --> 41:00.920
I've never actually needed to use that they have a really good online community a really really really good dashboard and they have apps for android

41:01.400 --> 41:02.680
and ios

41:02.680 --> 41:06.360
Which you can like set up device usage alerts. You can turn devices on and off

41:06.360 --> 41:10.140
Oh, that's the other neat thing. So like if you want to get like a ting myfi go to linux.ting.com

41:11.720 --> 41:13.480
ending today

41:13.480 --> 41:19.320
50 off a device or if you're gonna get like a myfi they're gonna give you a 50 service credit do this do this

41:19.800 --> 41:25.880
Go get the myfi and get 50 of data credit because here's the thing you're only paying for what you use

41:26.840 --> 41:30.600
So it's flat six dollars and then you get a myfi device and they've got like tri-band devices

41:30.600 --> 41:33.880
They got gsm devices if you've got one and you just want to go get a nine dollar sim

41:34.600 --> 41:36.280
Ting will give you a nine dollar gsm sim

41:36.280 --> 41:41.160
You can put an existing myfi device if it's unlocked. Oh, and by the way ting devices are unlocked. Yeah

41:41.880 --> 41:46.460
Yeah, all their devices are unlocked. So anyways, you can get a myfi device you go to linux.ting.com

41:46.920 --> 41:47.880
You get a fifth dollar discount

41:47.880 --> 41:51.160
You know, I think for the myfi instead of giving you money off the device itself

41:51.400 --> 41:53.080
They give you service credit

41:53.080 --> 41:54.600
But oh my god, dude

41:54.600 --> 41:57.480
That is gonna last you months and here's the best part about ting

41:57.480 --> 42:01.320
You can go into the android app or their dashboard on their website and you can just turn the device off

42:01.320 --> 42:03.880
Like if you're not going to use it for a month or two, then you don't pay for anything

42:04.200 --> 42:11.880
But like worst case scenario if you accidentally forget to turn the device off like you accidentally leave it on but you don't use it

42:12.520 --> 42:15.640
You're out six dollars. It's a six dollar hot spot

42:15.880 --> 42:20.200
I would pay six dollars just to have the internet available all the time like hey guys you want wi-fi

42:20.360 --> 42:23.880
Yeah, I got a hot spot right there. Like I could always be the guy that's got wi-fi

42:23.880 --> 42:29.560
Like six dollar freaking hot spot a month and you get a fifty dollars worth of credit when you go to linux.ting.com

42:29.560 --> 42:33.240
Now that's that's only good till the end of today and then it's a twenty five dollar credit

42:33.240 --> 42:35.240
That probably still lasts you more than two three months

42:36.120 --> 42:39.400
I don't know. It's up to you. It depends on your usage and then you can go get great phones

42:39.400 --> 42:45.160
I got the best phones everything from like seventy dollar feature phone sixty dollar feature phones all the way up to the best androids

42:45.320 --> 42:48.760
Like the s6 linux 6 the moto x2 all unlocked

42:48.760 --> 42:53.100
linux.ting.com also supports the linux unplugged program

42:53.100 --> 42:57.180
Would you like to see us do another 99 episodes? linux.ting.com

42:57.420 --> 43:03.620
Go to linux.ting.com and a big big thank you to ting and by the way ting's not just doing this all to wireless

43:03.620 --> 43:05.620
They're not just changing up the wireless industry

43:05.680 --> 43:11.580
They're also bringing fiber internet out there, which is really neat go check out their blog for their fiber internet service initiative

43:11.860 --> 43:14.260
Could you imagine like the ting model to fiber internet?

43:14.260 --> 43:19.140
Yeah, they're trying to do it linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program

43:19.660 --> 43:21.660
All right. So let's talk about oh

43:22.380 --> 43:27.260
Man, I can't even believe I have to say this out loud. This actually bothers me quite a bit

43:28.900 --> 43:31.620
Cisco is buying open DNS for

43:32.380 --> 43:36.980
635 million dollars with the deal to close in the first quarter of

43:38.260 --> 43:40.260
2016

43:40.260 --> 43:48.960
Open DNS has its special to me open DNS is a service that you can go to to help filter out porn gambling sites

43:50.560 --> 43:52.640
Malware all from afar

43:52.640 --> 43:57.440
You just set your DNS up to the open DNS servers and you can create an account and you can set up a client if you

43:57.440 --> 44:03.480
If you have a dynamic IP address and it automatically filters these things and as a parent, this is such a great solution

44:03.480 --> 44:08.100
I don't have to worry about putting you know parental controls on each individual computer

44:08.100 --> 44:13.200
I set it at the router to use open DNS and I filter it there or as a as a client

44:14.360 --> 44:18.120
Contractor I could go into my clients and be like, yeah, you want me to block malware and viruses?

44:18.120 --> 44:22.880
I could do some global filtering. Let me set your up DNA your upstream DNS to open DNS

44:22.880 --> 44:28.180
It's such a cool service. And in fact, not only do I have like that connection to it

44:28.800 --> 44:34.920
But in terms of traffic to the Jupiter broadcasting website and the YouTube channel on YouTube alone

44:34.920 --> 44:38.300
I our coverage just seem let me I'll pull it up right now

44:39.120 --> 44:41.680
Let's see. It's in here somewhere open DNS

44:43.360 --> 44:48.280
178,000 people watch my video on open DNS and way more downloaded on open DNS

44:48.280 --> 44:54.520
I covered I did a coverage of open DNS on December 19th 2008. This is extremely embarrassing

44:54.520 --> 44:56.520
I mean, this is extremely embarrassing

44:57.040 --> 45:01.160
But I'm gonna play it for you because I want you to know how near and dear open DNS is to my heart

45:01.160 --> 45:05.600
But this is the most embarrassing thing I've ever played on this show in this episode of an in-depth look

45:05.600 --> 45:11.460
I'm gonna go deep into open DNS and maybe why you should be using open DNS for your network

45:11.640 --> 45:17.520
The alternate title for this episode was is hey, look at open DNS. How awesome is this? How come I never knew about this?

45:17.520 --> 45:36.080
Open DNS in this episode of an in-depth. Look I'm going to assume that most of you probably know what DNS is

45:36.080 --> 45:41.440
If you don't hit the pause button and then go Wikipedia DNS and then come back

45:41.440 --> 45:49.400
Quick summaries that helps you resolve IP addresses to names if you browse the web you're using it if you send emails you're using it

45:49.920 --> 45:56.640
So I've always just used the DNS provided to me by my ISP who happens to be Comcast which you know, sure

45:56.640 --> 45:59.400
I thought DNS was DNS. No big deal then

45:59.960 --> 46:05.720
Lately, there's been some talk about open DNS and how it was patched against against a vulnerability

46:05.720 --> 46:12.400
that had come out that a lot of the main ISPs hadn't patched against yet some poisoning issues where someone could type in a

46:12.960 --> 46:14.680
URL and a

46:14.680 --> 46:19.720
Poisoned DNS server could give you a bad record and send you to a site that was either bogus or a phishing site or something

46:19.720 --> 46:21.600
like that and

46:21.600 --> 46:26.560
That kind of piqued my interest. So I thought well, I'll go check out this open DNS thing. See what this is about

46:27.560 --> 46:34.460
So I jumped to open DNS org and the thing that immediately struck me right away is they put their DNS IP

46:34.460 --> 46:37.580
addresses their IP addresses right there at the bottom of the page

46:37.740 --> 46:42.680
So there was no hoops to jump through no account to sign up if I wanted to start using open DNS

46:42.680 --> 46:48.760
I could and it was fairly evident to me pretty quickly that one of the advantages to doing that would be open DNS seems to have

46:49.860 --> 46:56.420
regional DNS servers which for me I'm in the Seattle area and they have a data center here in Seattle and

46:56.900 --> 47:01.180
they have a bunch of one other ones around the United States and they're adding them around the world and

47:01.180 --> 47:07.560
So it was fast. I wouldn't say I noticed a huge difference, but it did seem to me that my name resolution was

47:08.540 --> 47:11.860
Snappier, so I stuck with that for a couple of weeks thought hey, this is neat

47:13.180 --> 47:14.220
Then it kind of struck me

47:14.220 --> 47:18.960
I went back to open DNS his website and I saw that there was an option to make an account and I thought okay

47:18.960 --> 47:24.740
Well, what does this account do? What's the benefit and I I had some assumptions that I didn't really quite understand it

47:24.740 --> 47:28.560
So I went and I created an account at open DNS and I learned quite a few things now

47:28.560 --> 47:34.460
I my day job is I'm an IT consultant and one of the things I have a lot of issues with is

47:35.020 --> 47:39.520
Phishing and viruses and malware sites that my clients accidentally stumble upon

47:41.300 --> 47:48.740
Open DNS has the ability once you create an account you give it your IP address that your DNS queries will be coming from

47:48.740 --> 47:51.840
So in my case, I configured my router

47:51.840 --> 47:58.040
and I said router use these DNS servers instead of the Comcast DNS servers and

47:58.320 --> 48:00.880
Then I went to open DNS. They said okay open DNS

48:00.880 --> 48:07.960
Here's my IP address now like most of you on a DSL or cable modem or some sort of home broadband

48:08.440 --> 48:10.760
Your IP address is dynamic it changes

48:11.640 --> 48:16.000
Not an issue open DNS makes a client available for Windows Mac and Linux

48:16.000 --> 48:22.240
That you can load on your machine and it basically goes back and reports to open DNS when you have a new IP address

48:22.480 --> 48:26.600
So they automatically get the update and they always know what network number you're coming from

48:27.440 --> 48:32.160
Once they have your IP address you can do things like enable filtering

48:32.160 --> 48:36.280
Maybe you're a parent and you don't want your children going to sites that aren't appropriate for children

48:36.280 --> 48:40.160
Or maybe like you're like me and you only have adults in the house

48:40.160 --> 48:45.320
You don't care what they do, but you do want to protect against malware and phishing sites. So I have mine crew

48:45.320 --> 48:48.400
Oh, wow, I can't really imagine a time when I only had adults in the house

48:48.400 --> 48:49.920
I'm gonna stop right there cuz the chat room is dying

48:49.920 --> 48:54.640
But that gives you the basic summary of open DNS if you want to watch the rest of the video go screw yourself

48:55.920 --> 48:57.600
I'm not gonna tell you even how to find it

48:57.600 --> 49:00.280
If you don't know how to find that then you'd probably don't even need to bother

49:01.040 --> 49:03.040
It's horrible and that was embarrassing

49:03.080 --> 49:09.660
But I really have a deep connection to open DNS and so today when I read the news that mother effing Cisco

49:09.920 --> 49:13.860
Was buying open DNS. I'm had a little bit of a mental breakdown

49:13.860 --> 49:18.380
I love open DNS. I have so many clients in the past that are still using open DNS

49:18.600 --> 49:20.800
Well, hold on don't give away the secret sauce

49:20.800 --> 49:27.480
I have to wonder is this the beginning of the end of open DNS or am I overreacting can someone in the mumble room?

49:27.480 --> 49:31.320
Talk me down. What do you guys think? It's just go buy an open DNS gonna be awful. I

49:32.880 --> 49:37.020
Can say I don't care. Oh really tell me why the DNS was already awful

49:37.020 --> 49:44.900
Oh, yeah open DNS baby has ads everywhere. They overtake service if something fails

49:44.900 --> 49:46.500
They give you this massive

49:46.500 --> 49:53.460
Ad infested garbage portal where there's other services like open Nick, which is much better

49:53.460 --> 49:59.340
Oh do any of this stuff open DNS does I don't care that they're buying something that is trash anyway

49:59.340 --> 50:00.100
I love it

50:00.100 --> 50:06.300
So anybody that thinks that I only have yes-men working with me reference that moment right there because I totally disagree

50:06.300 --> 50:07.800
I think that open DNS

50:07.800 --> 50:14.140
Put a really friendly face on something that was completely unapproachable to the masses and it was something that I could show the average user

50:14.300 --> 50:16.140
How to go manage?

50:16.140 --> 50:19.640
Yeah, it used to be good in 2008. It is not now

50:21.700 --> 50:26.740
All right, well you're making me feel better at least if nothing else I love it I still think it's okay

50:26.740 --> 50:30.820
All right mountain dev you want to also could chime in on open Nick go ahead, sir

50:30.820 --> 50:38.100
Mountain oh good. I'm using open Nick and it's working pretty well, but open DNS. They used to offer free

50:39.300 --> 50:40.420
free

50:40.420 --> 50:44.100
Dynamic DNS service and they quit doing that a long time ago, too

50:48.500 --> 50:52.020
Wow, all right, okay ham radio Layden Layden get please jump in

50:53.500 --> 50:58.580
All right, Chris. Well, I totally agree with you. I love open DNS. I've used it open DNS

50:58.580 --> 51:04.500
I love open DNS. I've used it open DNS for years. I I have configured all of the

51:04.980 --> 51:10.180
My clients computers whenever I work on a computer for a client. I always search them over to open DNS

51:10.260 --> 51:17.660
There you go. Hey go eat even if they don't use the filtering. I always search them over to open DNS

51:18.660 --> 51:24.700
I've been using open DNS from myself for years my family for years. I've used the filtering

51:24.700 --> 51:29.520
I think it's great, and I love them cash you seven if you you you say you give it to everybody

51:29.620 --> 51:31.620
Have you tried anything else?

51:34.540 --> 51:36.540
Damn it no

51:36.540 --> 51:41.900
All right, so you make actually I'm super you actually I was seriously kind of going

51:41.900 --> 51:43.540
I would get on the bump train that was gonna

51:43.540 --> 51:47.500
I had an express pass to bum town and you were actually making me feel a lot better about this

51:47.660 --> 51:49.820
So apparently there's other things to try out there

51:49.820 --> 51:54.620
But Corky says I love open DNS Chris last and so do hundreds of other system

51:54.620 --> 51:57.440
It's Corky. How come the hell you're never in the chat in the mobile room damn it

51:57.940 --> 52:01.860
Damn, I could use your backup right now, but I you know what I will give open Nick a shot

52:01.860 --> 52:03.860
I'll switch it over here now

52:03.860 --> 52:11.640
Also, we have covered on the tech snap program if you have watched there are times when using Google DNS and open DNS and open

52:11.640 --> 52:13.640
Nick aren't necessarily the best

52:15.020 --> 52:18.460
Sometimes now this is less and less and less and less of a problem

52:18.460 --> 52:23.900
But sometimes CDNs have a hard time figuring out where you're coming from when you use these global DNS services

52:23.900 --> 52:27.420
So anyways, I won't I won't I won't talk over my paygrade

52:27.420 --> 52:31.220
But Alan goes into more details in tech snap and you can do some searching around the web

52:31.580 --> 52:34.700
Wait for that. Oh, okay. I got to give our Rekha a plug here

52:34.700 --> 52:38.420
He says because this Rekha PD has always got a good got sound advice

52:38.420 --> 52:44.140
He says I gave up on open DNS when the redirect failed DNS resolutions to their custom search page. Yeah

52:44.140 --> 52:48.900
Yeah, the custom search stuff is total crap. I ain't when when rotten mentioned that I kind of had to agree

52:49.580 --> 52:54.220
Oh, but I'm a conscious that open Nick doesn't have any kind of filtering. Is that true run?

52:56.860 --> 53:00.340
It doesn't have any filtering that by default you can you can do filtering

53:00.340 --> 53:04.940
All right, so I can say a box porn block malware block gambling. I'm not that level

53:05.420 --> 53:08.220
So it doesn't do what open DNS does it all then?

53:08.220 --> 53:16.220
No, most people don't even use open DNS for that. They use it to get it off of their ISP or to not use Google or stuff like that

53:16.220 --> 53:21.940
No, no, it is to provide network-wide prevention of porn and spam and malware. I

53:23.060 --> 53:28.500
Don't know. I haven't tried I've never tried to filter my DNS. So I've don't I've not even tried to do open Nick

53:28.500 --> 53:32.820
So it's because you never want to stop having porn displayed on your screen. That's why

53:32.820 --> 53:36.820
I always

53:38.620 --> 53:45.460
Hope we can I ask you a personal question because you you're closer than I am and I'm more I'm much further away from this

53:45.460 --> 53:50.540
But have you considered parental filtering and if you have have you considered open DNS?

53:50.980 --> 53:53.860
So I actually use open DNS my my router

53:54.380 --> 54:00.420
Or my the the box that connects me to the Internet actually has those the open DNS as the default

54:01.180 --> 54:02.420
DNS

54:02.420 --> 54:03.780
servers

54:03.780 --> 54:08.540
So my kids around the house have iPads Android tablets, you know

54:09.540 --> 54:14.740
computers and they all default to whatever the router gives them which is right DNS same is set to

54:15.900 --> 54:21.060
You know block all the naughty stuff, but there I mean, I'm not I'm not using that as a replacement for being a good parent

54:21.220 --> 54:27.460
You know and also it doesn't work in some situations like they can still read the comments on YouTube

54:27.460 --> 54:33.680
They sure to visit right pretty crappy if there's crap on YouTube. It doesn't prevent that right does not replace parent

54:34.380 --> 54:41.180
Where I notice it is if I want to go to one of those websites. I have to change the DNS settings on my own

54:42.300 --> 54:47.900
In order to override my own control. Are you concerned at all about two things one?

54:47.900 --> 54:51.420
Are you concerned about Cisco mucking this up? That's the first one

54:53.220 --> 54:57.140
No, because I think open DNS came along because there was a need for them to exist

54:57.140 --> 55:02.020
And if Cisco screw it up someone else come along and replace it. That's nice. I like that

55:02.180 --> 55:06.820
Okay, here's what can I tell you what actually freaks me out about this and I'm wondering if this scares you too

55:06.820 --> 55:12.780
I don't like any other solution for Linux and I want my kids to use Linux, but I don't want them

55:12.780 --> 55:18.020
I mean I need to have some I just want to protect them like from really nasty stuff and I

55:18.180 --> 55:22.900
Felt like open DNS struck that balance of me having some filtering

55:22.900 --> 55:27.860
But allowing not having to worry about installing nanny software on Linux and this twitch is gonna suck

55:27.940 --> 55:33.780
So are you worried about that at all? Let's be realistic like what you know, what are you trying to hide them from rotten.com or?

55:34.380 --> 55:35.300
You pawn calm

55:35.300 --> 55:35.620
Yeah

55:35.620 --> 55:43.900
what exactly you're trying to protect them from because the fact is that most people are either most children are more vulnerable to

55:44.700 --> 55:46.180
things like

55:46.180 --> 55:50.780
Members of their own family. I'm not accusing you Chris, but they're more likely to be

55:50.780 --> 55:55.180
Attacked by a member of their own family or it would be in a chat situation

55:55.580 --> 55:58.980
so something like someone connecting to them on Instagram or

55:59.940 --> 56:03.300
What's app or something which won't be blocked by any of these tools?

56:03.300 --> 56:07.260
So they are almost a hundred percent ineffectual there

56:07.260 --> 56:12.840
They make you feel better, but they actually don't do that much good at all wise very wise in a go-go

56:12.840 --> 56:14.840
You want to make a mention about a proxy server here?

56:14.840 --> 56:22.920
Well, it's the proxy server seems to be the best between both rules because it blocks sub directories of certain websites and it

56:22.920 --> 56:29.720
Can it blocks domains and it caches stuff depending on how you got set up so you can bring down the uses and filter bad sites

56:30.320 --> 56:34.480
Yeah, I like that. Um, you're right. That just takes more work and

56:35.080 --> 56:39.480
It makes me want to use pf sense, which isn't Linux based, but you're right. That would be a great solution

56:39.480 --> 56:45.200
Rekha says open Nick has DNS blacklisting. There's also Norton connect safe DNS servers that have filtering against porn

56:45.200 --> 56:48.440
You know what? There's gonna be a lot of porn filtering stuff out there. So there's a lot of solutions

56:48.440 --> 56:52.640
I'm sure and that but that's that's less of my worry like my daughter recently

56:52.640 --> 56:55.600
I mean, she's got an iPhone and recently she signed up for

56:56.400 --> 57:01.640
Instagram and I didn't know this at the time and we thought we'd educated her in the school do a good

57:02.200 --> 57:06.280
internet safety thing, but you know, she took her phone to

57:06.280 --> 57:12.840
Theater where she was performing and backstage with all the other kids. They were all talking about their Instagram accounts

57:12.840 --> 57:14.840
So she set up an Instagram account now

57:14.840 --> 57:21.280
She's in a completely different network on as a guest on their Wi-Fi where they don't use open DNS

57:21.280 --> 57:26.000
So any controls that I implement in a home right useless because she's sat on someone else's net and that's gonna be more and more

57:26.000 --> 57:27.360
The case, isn't it?

57:27.360 --> 57:28.600
Right

57:28.600 --> 57:32.000
Yeah, good point. Yeah, that's that's the reality, especially

57:32.000 --> 57:35.520
for kids is it's gonna be on these mobile devices and

57:36.400 --> 57:40.760
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. All right. You guys have made me feel a lot better about that. Thanks guys. That was nice

57:40.760 --> 57:43.920
That was like I feel like that was a good session for Chris. That was really good. Why don't we?

57:45.280 --> 57:49.600
Let's break it up. Let's change gears. Let's talk about gaming really quick. I can't believe it

57:50.800 --> 57:58.840
Valve says that the pre-orders for the steam machines and the controller have sold out valve is sold out of the controllers as of today

57:58.840 --> 58:06.240
and the steam machines, which are supposed to launch on November 10th, which could be a really good sign for

58:06.920 --> 58:08.760
gamers and Linux

58:08.760 --> 58:15.000
Because there's a lot of things that are moving in this area right now a lot of interesting developments around Vulcan around metal

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
around DirectX 11 around

58:17.520 --> 58:22.920
Crossover bringing DirectX 11 and DirectX 12. I mean so much is happening right now in the gaming space

58:22.920 --> 58:26.320
So it is critical that the steam machines start to make some movement around the game

58:26.320 --> 58:31.880
So it is critical that the steam machines start to make some movement here and the fact that they're sold out. I

58:32.560 --> 58:37.160
Think is a good sign, but rotten corpse. You're disappointed by it. Tell me why?

58:38.400 --> 58:41.560
I'm disappointed about the news because I neglected to get a controller

58:43.600 --> 58:45.240
Okay, I

58:45.240 --> 58:47.280
Ordered the controller in the link, you know

58:47.280 --> 58:49.600
This is what Chris does and you guys all think all

58:49.780 --> 58:54.000
By the way, all of you jerks out there to think I just buy stuff because I their toys screw you

58:54.000 --> 58:57.160
I hate you. I bought this so that way I could talk about it

58:57.160 --> 59:00.600
I want to try to talk about it as soon as possible on the Linux action show in Linux unplugged

59:00.600 --> 59:05.440
So I pre-ordered the controller and the link. I'm not a big gamer, but I want to have an opinion on them

59:05.440 --> 59:10.200
So hopefully those will arrive we will see and I will have it a review soon

59:10.200 --> 59:17.040
I I don't know if valve can make the ultimate controller, but we'll see Mountain Dev. You say it's disappointing perhaps

59:17.040 --> 59:19.040
Why do you think so?

59:19.200 --> 59:23.560
Well, it might be because they underestimated not a people that would buy the controller

59:23.560 --> 59:25.560
Ah, ah

59:25.920 --> 59:28.640
Perhaps perhaps I think it builds a bit of a buzz

59:29.600 --> 59:32.320
Exactly that it gives it press by saying hey we sold out

59:32.320 --> 59:34.680
So even more people are talking about it's even more people are wanting it

59:34.680 --> 59:38.200
So then when they get the nut and there's not the only shipment they're ever gonna do

59:38.200 --> 59:41.840
So it's just gonna get more pressure for the next time that they do it

59:42.680 --> 59:47.760
Exactly exactly and here's exactly here. Now if you want to think who wants to take bets

59:47.760 --> 59:50.760
Let's let's let's get a poll going chat room do this

59:50.760 --> 59:56.000
Will this thing will it ship the smack zero will it ship yes or no somebody saw the straw poll right now?

59:56.240 --> 01:00:01.640
Smack zero will it ship yes or no also known it was previously known as the steam boy

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:08.280
It is a handheld steam machine. Are you seeing this thing if you're watching the video version? It's great. It's precious

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:11.240
It's got an AMD embedded g-series system on the chip graphics

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:17.560
It's got the egg water based CPU and of course got some built-in Radeon graphics with four gigabytes of RAM

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:21.240
32 gigabytes of memory and an SD card slot yeah

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:28.520
It's got a 5 inch touchscreen with a 720p bad boy resolution and also configurable tactile gamepads HDMI output Wi-Fi

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.440
connectivity and

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:34.680
4g mobile connectivity in the pro model it is a handheld steam

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:42.120
Machine, and I would cast my vote as never ship straw poll somebody in the chat room go make it will the smack zero ship

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.720
Yes, or no

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:50.520
Rekai says yes, what'll happen is Ben heck will just put a PC in a

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:57.960
There you go, it's done. Oh yeah, just watch Ben Hicks YouTube channel, and he puts everything in tiny boxes job done

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:04.240
Yeah, that is the whole try and battery power the steam link with some form of display what we need to do

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.360
Go ahead

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:13.760
Obviously, I think the best solution is just to get like make the Nvidia shield work with the right stuff

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.760
Yeah, that would be nice. You got the pretty much the exact same thing

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:23.680
But also a you know a full controller and not that weird game gear looking thing so micro 89 has his ear to the news

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:28.080
Here he says pricing comes out in August with possible launch mid 2016

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.280
I would kind of want I feel like if this doesn't ship

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.960
We should do a segment on how to build one somehow. There's got to be a way. This is got to be doable now

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:45.760
I think it's called some what it was called on the pie to basically do Nvidia streaming

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:51.840
Exactly or actually you could do steam streaming you could just like if there was some way to get the pie to do steam link

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.120
Or something like that

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:57.320
You'd have a you'd basically have all that you need to have to get this thing to work all right

01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.440
So I teased it earlier just before we get out of the gaming all together

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.760
I know you guys a lot of you out there

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:06.640
Don't care about gaming that much if you would just like a nice casual fun game

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.520
It's a little exhilarating kind of gets the adrenaline going

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.800
Doesn't have a lot to it doesn't have a lot of setup doesn't have a lot of story

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:20.580
It's a racing game. It's called distance. It's the game. You never knew you wanted on Linux, but it's here now

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:24.040
I've been playing it for a couple of weeks. It's I think still kind of in the early stages

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:31.480
Distance is a survival racing game that combines intense action of arcade racing with the exploration of atmospheric world now

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:35.320
I'll show you what that means here in a second what I actually do is I crank up

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.400
This is kind of embarrassing I crank up deadmau5 in the background, and I play this game

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:45.680
But here I'll play a little bit on the video version for you to see it's a really intense racing game in the future

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.680
And it's a lot of fun

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:53.840
And it does have a great built-in soundtrack as well as you can see here you're driving around you get booster you get thrusters

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:59.280
You got to make jumps the tracks are very futuristic and crazy, and you get points for making additional moves

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:05.040
And it's multiplayer, which is a lot of fun, and it's right now. It's available on Steam. It's called distance and

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:12.440
It is playable. Here's the other thing. I like a lot about it is it's playable on my XPS 13 in 4k

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.800
resolution on the iris

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:20.200
5500 and it scales up very nicely up to my dedicated desktop with an NVIDIA 770 or

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:26.520
7780 something in a graphic series, so it plays very nicely on a wide range of Linux desktops

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:29.880
You may even be able to play this one with the open source graphics

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.040
I've experimented a little bit the open source graphics at a 1080p resolution

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.240
It was still able to play this game

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:38.040
So this is one of these games that is nice to kind of actually

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:41.960
Still get a little enjoyment about it out of your video card without having a little proprietary driver

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:46.280
But if you do load the proprietary driver, then you get things like 4k resolution

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:51.040
Or you get things like on the NVIDIA machine like you get the music bumping you get the high resolution stuff going

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:54.280
It's it scales up pretty well, and it's a nice intense game

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.240
It's called distance, and it's available on the Steam store right now

01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:02.400
And it's my current favorite along with this and race the Sun they both are have a similar feel to it and

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:07.600
Gammon on Linux just did a write-up, and they said and I agree they said it's the one of the best Linux games

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.120
You don't know about

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.560
That you need

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:15.400
That you need right now distance, and I have no idea how much it cost doesn't matter

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:20.420
It's worth it. Go check it out. It's on Steam. It's not open source. It's not free

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:23.440
It's just to give yourself a good time for a few minutes

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:28.520
And you don't have to even have crazy-ass graphics you can get by with on the Intel graphics, which

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:33.240
20 bucks 20 bucks. Thank you. Wow would you were you looking it up while I was talking about it?

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.520
Yes, dude nice producer in

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.520
Very well done sir very well done

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.760
Oh

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:43.200
Reek I suggest we should do a photo versus distance

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:49.040
I agree that should be the next photo for sure is a or maybe not the next but the next versus is distance

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:53.320
It's a good game Linux. It's funny. We've got first-person shooters. We got tons of tactical games

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.400
We got lots of pixel games pixel art games

01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:01.480
But we don't have a lot of racing games and so this is actually pretty decent one $22 if you're Canadian so Sean's PC

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:05.200
Nice backup producer and Sean thank you from the Canadian perspective

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:10.040
I know that seems like a lot, but you're also contributing to the development, and it is truly a fun game

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:13.280
And the fact that they're developing it in it with Linux support and parity

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:18.540
I think is worth supporting at least me and and for me that's worth backing, but it's up to you check it out

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:24.640
We'll have a link in this show notes now or yeah completeness. It's $14.99 in proper British money. Oh

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:31.600
That is quite proper actually. Thank you, sir. Wow look at that good tertiary producing mr.. Popey tertiary producing

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.600
All

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.960
Right I got one last topic. It's only a rumor

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:43.040
We don't do rumors a lot like the Mac guys those SOBs they get like that's that's their bread and butter in fact

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:47.760
They don't even have facts. They have rumors and intentions and and mysticism and in Linux

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:54.200
We have like mailing lists and code and discussions out in the open. It's all very very real

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.200
It's all very concrete very rarely

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:00.580
Are there rumors about a feature coming to the Linux desktop?

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:06.340
It literally could change everything and it's called get ready for this

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.420
pulse video

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.020
Pulse video

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:16.780
We're gonna talk about that in just a minute, but first I gotta tell you about our last sponsor Linux Academy

01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:19.780
Go to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged to get our

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:28.260
33% discount now Linux Academy is basically a better idea than Jupiter broadcasting. I'm gonna be honest with you

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:29.700
It's what I should have done

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:35.620
If I could do over I might have gone this route when I when we started going out when we started developing how to Linux

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:43.080
I realized there is a serious opportunity here, but here's the thing I'm not an educator. I'm not educator well obviously

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:46.740
I'm not I'm not a college professor. I can't teach people stuff

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:52.580
I can talk a lot barely most the time about 5050 depends if I've gone to a brewery before I've done a show

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:58.460
But most the time I am NOT the best educator. I'm an enthusiast. I'm passionate about Linux. I'm passionate about open-source

01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:00.220
I watch the trends

01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:06.780
That's where Linux Academy closed the gap see they took these open-source enthusiasts for Linux and oh and all of this and

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:13.660
they paired them up with the educators and they paired up with with developers and they created the Linux Academy platform and

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:19.940
That gives them the secret sauce that sites like Linda and the other crap sites that they cover everything

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:25.420
but it's not their life passion so they don't go as deep as you need them to go as

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:28.540
You want them to go as deep as you go right?

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:33.420
That's the problem isn't it is you go deeper than all these other people go because this is your passion

01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:35.420
This is your hobby. This is what you think about

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:42.100
These other sites is a checkbox. It's a checkbox for them to say they have courses on Red Hat certification

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:44.820
It's insulting

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:49.900
I'm not going to spend my hard-earned money on a site where a Linux of course is a checkbox to them

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:55.900
I want to spend my hard-earned money on excite where Linux is and open-source is all they do because that's what they care about

01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:59.860
That's why the Linux Academy has things like their foundation grant where they're going to give

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:04.820
$5,000 to open-source projects they have self-paced courses you can go take over

01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:12.620
1,500 courses where you can pick your Linux distribution 7 plus distros all of the courseware changes all of the VPS is that they'll

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:15.240
Spin up on-demand for you change to match that distribution

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:20.640
So now you're based labs that way you'll work with the real serious awesome open-source technology

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:25.260
Hands-on when you go out there, and you go into the employment place you've worked with this stuff

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.840
What does that mean?

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:34.080
That means you have the confidence that means that the first time you have to go work with an nginx config file in the real

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:38.480
World isn't when you're on the job. It's when you're on a Linux Academy VPS

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:41.720
It means the first time you've ever learned open stack isn't on the job

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:45.880
It's when you're on Linux Academy, and you have instructor help to back you up you have an awesome community

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:49.720
That to be honest at this point the debt the deck is stacked for you guys

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.460
It's full of Jupiter broadcasting community members

01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:57.700
So they're there to really cheer you on and I get emails from them about they taking that they take this courseware

01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:03.580
And then they go get these certifications and Linux Academy has the best stuff on Docker open stack virtual box VMware KVM

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:09.400
And of course the AWS entire stack all of the Red Hat stuff that you need to go get a serious job or to get

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:13.200
That next notch on the review they've got it and then last but not least if you're an old salt

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.120
They've got these nuggets

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:21.720
I love this when you're in between courses go check out these nuggets a single how to the walks you through doing specific tasks

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:25.600
They don't belong necessarily in an entire course. You know it could be two to sixteen minutes long

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:31.360
it's like boom deep dive on this topic get better on this thing that you've been meaning to do and

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.840
expand on it

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:37.520
Everything from like backup snapshots all this stuff in just a nugget

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.940
It's so slick and you can get started right now go to linuxacademy.com

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:57.880
Thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux unplugged program you guys are awesome and keep up the great work

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:03.480
Now the grousing about pulse audio hasn't even died down yet

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:08.040
But it looks like the billions may have been spilled on Paul's video now

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.320
Ferronix is purporting

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:19.880
There may be an announcement imminent concerning some of the pulse video project details now an open-source contributor at Red Hat

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:26.600
Christian Schaller has worked on G streamer in the past he's also worked on gnome and transcording apps other multimedia projects

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.120
He seems ready

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.240
To announce Paul's video now the reason why this came out is on the gnome planet feed

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:39.120
Seemingly by mistake a link to a blog post with a password

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:44.560
Protecting it named introducing pulse video hit the RSS feed

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:52.600
When you refresh it also says fedora workstation next steps introducing pinnows now when you look around

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:58.840
There's no other references to pinnows when searching the github or the old get repository, but there is some references to pulse video. Oh

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:04.080
Oh, well actually it looks like there's an announcement right now as we read this right now

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:10.440
Pinnows has been announced for a while. This is Wow breaking right now hold on. Let's break it out you guys

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:15.040
This is incredible happening right now on the show. Holy smokes. Oh my god

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.440
That's not it at all get out of here. It's this one

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.440
Oh

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:27.400
Box news alert pinnows is linux video what pulse audio is for audio just a few hours after this story

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:32.840
It's been announced pulse video is ready to go for fedora workstation to improve linux video support

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:38.680
In a new blog post to display one of the original goals of pinnows was to provide the same level of advanced hardware handling for video

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.040
That pulse audio provides for audio for those of you have been around for a while

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:47.360
You might remember how you once upon a time could only have one application using a sound card at a time

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:52.520
Pulse audio properly fix that well pinnows will allow you to share your video camera between multiple

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:56.160
Applications and also provide an easy API to do so

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.200
Holy shit

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.200
Holy shit

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.880
This could be huge for Jupiter broadcasting

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:14.640
This oh my god this could enable an entire generation of applications that are competitive with Wirecast if

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:20.960
If this is done, right? Wow, this is a huge deal. This is happening right now

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:21.400
I mean

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:27.880
So this is interesting because one of the things that the Jupiter broadcasting mostly me is trying to figure out is

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:32.080
If we continue to raise funds at patreon.com slash today

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:35.200
I kind of want to do what poppy is doing or I'm not no sorry poppy

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:36.600
You guys all look the same

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:36.920
well

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.280
I kind of want to do what wimpy is doing and and I want to contribute some of the extra funds and not really extra but

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:47.040
I want to contribute some of the funds to open source projects that we are migrating to so almost on a monthly basis

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:51.440
We replace some sort of proprietary component in our chain with an open source component

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:57.760
And as we do that, I I feel like I should contribute to them and I should and I should help enable their development

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.520
This is this is exactly what we need. This is huge for us. So um

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:09.260
So most of you out there think of QuickTime as this POS

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:12.300
desktop application that is just atrocious and

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:16.620
And then don't even don't even get me started on the browser plug-in on Windows

01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:22.180
It's just awful in reality the QuickTime API and the subsystem on OS 10 is amazing

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:29.500
It's what enables Final Cut and Wirecast and motion and I movie and and pixelmator and all of these and core and core

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:33.200
Graphics and core audio and all of these things that are available on OS 10

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:39.880
They're actually really good that by bypassing have this horrible reputation Oh QuickTime such a piece of shit, but actually

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.720
They're incredible on the OS 10 platform. This is exactly what OS 10 is available

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:46.240
This is exactly what has kept some of our video production

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:53.520
ie Wirecast on OS 10 is one subsystem that could bring in all of the inputs and then make it available to the

01:13:53.680 --> 01:14:01.020
applications and if and OBS has just started to make this available by using the hell out of FFmpeg and if we could have

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.080
Something like pulse audio. That's for video

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:10.760
This could bring Linux ahead by five years in media production if they can actually pull it off

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:14.700
I'm really excited about this in a go-go. What do you think I?

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:23.180
Think in some cases it just could go really badly like just now I have was using pulse audio my speakers were going through my

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.380
My my output was going through my inputs going back into my microphone input

01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:35.180
So if this is made by the same people who made pulse audio, it's that's I think that's gonna happen, but with video instead. I

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:40.820
Think it's not made by the same people who made pulse audio. Yeah, and that's why they didn't call it pulse video, right?

01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:48.900
Right and Christian Challa has has worked on Gstreamer for a long time and he's worked in media production on Linux for a long time

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:53.100
So I trust that guy to do the right thing. So

01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:55.980
Go ahead

01:14:55.980 --> 01:15:02.700
They look at the clothes. No, they said pulse audio style as in just like the same goals of what they were doing

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:07.700
Yeah, yeah, the comparisons are from a developer standpoint use of the API not from an end-user

01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:10.300
mute standpoint

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.300
Right. They say video frame

01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:17.660
Passing will be done via file descriptors and separate apps and processes will be communicated via D bus

01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:23.860
Pinos will make it easier to switch cameras and applications and for the same camera source to be used by multiple apps simultaneously

01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:31.060
There will be support for multiple types of video inputs G streamer integration and some audio support. So it's really nothing like pulse audio

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:38.660
Yeah, and if it's an extension I've used the screen recording features of the dome 3 and they're excellent

01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:43.780
So if that was extended to have more inputs and outputs and a better interface, I think that's great. Oh

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.220
my god, I

01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:52.220
Mean I feel like this if it's done, right because here's pulse audio is getting pretty good. It's I

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:57.700
Can't stand here and tell you that it's it's better than what's on Windows or OS 10 maybe

01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:03.580
But I I definitely have had a lot of problems with it for the last month. It's been pretty good

01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:08.420
So I can't get I can't get crazy here

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:15.420
But a lot of times people have asked me what would it take to move some of your editing and some of your final production

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:17.900
steps over to Linux and I've always said

01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:25.980
It doesn't matter if we get Lightworks. It doesn't matter if we have FM peg because we don't have this fundamental piping system

01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:32.620
This fundamental piping of the camera inputs the normalization of the camera subsystem that you know

01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:36.700
Right now on Linux if you want to switch between cameras video for Linux is your best friend

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:42.660
But you still have to write so many esoteric different kind of accommodations for different cameras

01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:46.620
And it's just it's it is a you think Android fragmentation is bad

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:52.340
You have never witnessed anything like video management under Linux and if there could be a subsystem that comes along

01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:56.360
like QuickTime does and and core video does under OS 10 and

01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:04.420
normalizes all of this and enables a new generation of applications where developers can focus on managing the input from this pulse video

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:09.780
Pino system if they can work focus on that and not focus on writing all this esoteric side code

01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:13.180
It could really help Linux catch up super fast

01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:18.380
I have felt that without this system Linux has a five to ten year gap to be truly competitive

01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:24.980
If this over the next couple of years can actually become something usable it could dramatically close that gap

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:31.180
because this is the underlying pinning system that really makes media production possible on OS 10 and

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:37.420
You don't really understand how that is how in critical it is until you actually do video media production

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:42.500
and then you realize why people choose Macs over Windows and Linux and and

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:48.460
Windows doesn't have something like this it has it has something kind of similar. It doesn't have this and and

01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:52.140
This is a big deal. I'm very excited. So I'm gonna follow this

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:55.020
I would love rotten if you wouldn't mind Martin noting down

01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:58.620
Maybe we can get some interviews with these people and follow it because this could be a huge deal

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:04.180
Really excited kind of neat that the story broke why we're recording the show too because it could be long-term

01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:07.780
Right here. We are in episode 99 and it could be a long-term

01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:13.360
Long-term the big technology shift that helps us move everything over to Linux

01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:16.180
Maybe or maybe I'm just getting too excited

01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:20.900
But I it could be also says here that it should enable better screen casting support within gnome 3

01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:26.380
Video support for desktop sandboxes. Hello Wayland and many other potential use cases

01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:32.140
So those of us who have wondered how the hell we can do screen casting and screenshots under Wayland because of all the sandboxing

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:35.660
This could also provide the solutions for that

01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:40.700
Which is great for those of us who want to make how-to's and document things like that

01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:45.460
So I'm pretty excited mumble room last chance any final thoughts on this before we wrap up for the day. I

01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:49.420
Think pulse audio gets a bad rap

01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:54.980
Lot more than it deserves and it does a lot of cool things that if we didn't have pulse

01:18:54.980 --> 01:19:00.300
I would be incredibly disappointed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you know like to be honest

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:04.300
We had individual application volume control support well before Microsoft ever shipped that

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:06.780
Yeah, Chris, I think your comparison to

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:12.660
To to the Mac and to I already forgot the name of it having a brain fart

01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:15.660
Pinos or whatever Pinos P I N O S

01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:21.140
So, I think you know that comparison I think is very apt, you know, we have not only FFmpeg

01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:24.740
We have G streamer as well and those tools are getting really good

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:30.220
So being able to plug in and out of this. Yes. Yes. It's gonna be very critical. Yes

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:35.620
Yes, this is coming along when FFmpeg is getting really well in pulse audio is stabilizing exactly

01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:38.540
So to make the point

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:43.740
You made a point about how Linux is forever changing. This is a good example of that change

01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:46.460
Yes, yeah. Yeah

01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:50.620
Going back to our mint discussion you mean good points and so a good point

01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:52.380
Well put way to bring it all back together

01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:54.780
This is a good reason to hang out on mint or

01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:59.100
Mattei for a little while because this stuff does just keep on changing. All right. Well, I

01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:03.700
Well, maybe we'll leave it right there. Hold on. No, no, no, no, no, hold on. We'll leave it right there

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:07.220
So if you would like to join us live and make an excellent at a closing point like Sun Soul just did

01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:11.580
Join us over at jblive.tv. We do this show live at 2 p.m

Pacific over jblive.tv go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:23.580
Maybe next week. I'll have a quieter air conditioner. So there won't be that background Starship hum

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:27.180
Just picture me on the bridge of the USS Enterprise won't you and that'll explain the hum

01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:30.780
Linux action show at reddit.com contribute to this show give us links

01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:35.820
Also, there'll be a feedback thread for episode 99 and don't forget email me if you want to hang out

01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:43.180
For episode 100 in studio and meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for our OSCON meetup and remember promo code Linux

01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:46.700
If you're gonna buy a ticket for OSCON, I everybody thanks so much to this week's episode of Linux unplugged

01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:57.580
See you right back here next week

01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:31.740
Yeah, you know what I wonder what'll haunt that pinos project is

01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:40.540
Internally, they probably did consider it to be pulse video because internally they recognize that pulse audio was the example of an open source project

01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:47.660
Has huge ambitions and over time gets refined and works out the bugs and ends up being maybe better than what the commercial offerings have

01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:54.220
And so if you have that rationale it makes a lot of sense to call the next iteration for video pulse video

01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:57.420
But then internally so you could see how they would stage things like that

01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:02.820
Because we have prototype names for shows that we're developing in-house that we don't launch with those names

01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:06.540
But that's what we refer to it as and and that's how we all think about it

01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:10.860
But we wouldn't publicly call it that just like they wouldn't publicly call it Paul's video

01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:14.540
They want to call it pinos, but their draft blog post called it Paul Paul's video

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:19.820
The the draft URL called it Paul's video and that's what for Onyx picked up on and now that's what we're calling it

01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:23.980
and you got to wonder if a little bit if they could rewind the clock if they would just

01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:27.900
Opt to never have the the meme Paul's video out in the public at all

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:33.100
Oh our jb title site is down. Oh, no. Oh, no

01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:37.820
How are we gonna pick a title if our title site is down? Are we capable of coming up with a title on our own?

01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:44.700
Yeah, someone suggested parents action show which made me chuckle. That was pretty good. But would you watch that?

01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:48.460
Anyway, it's loading for me

01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:50.780
We can we can make we can make a title

01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:53.980
breaking linux

01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:57.980
Check out these nuggets. Thanks. It's a good one

01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:04.060
Compulsive video still works. Yeah, there you go repulsive video

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:12.540
Should we do something around the pulse video pinot stuff since that's breaking news or should we do something around open dns?

01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:16.860
Uh, or we should do something around boring distributions. We had some good discussions in this episode

01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:20.780
Wait

01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:26.720
What boring district distros go the distance like that jimotowns.com

01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:31.580
Oh is the voting not working? Maybe that just means we're having more traffic than normal

01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:34.460
I hope that's what that means

01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:37.340
Oh, yeah, oh boy. Oh boy

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:40.300
Oh boy. Oh man, that's no good

01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:42.300
so

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:45.420
Server error. How awful was that video? I played of my in-depth look

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:51.820
Like do I seem really do I do I present a lot differently? Is it a huge difference? Oh, that's a big difference

01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:54.700
Big difference more confidence. Oh, yeah, yeah, huh?

01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:57.500
It sounds like I would have said the same thing

01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:01.500
I feel like I would have said the same thing you would have you would have but you you sounded like uh,

01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:03.980
a lot less confident and

01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:10.860
You yeah, it was like every other youtube video of someone just blurting stuff out unprepared in front of a camera

01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:14.300
yeah, you did actually you could you sound a different dude just like the

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:16.780
Uh, not just what you said and how you approached it

01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:20.940
But like I don't know for some reason you sound like your voice is deeper now or something

01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:23.820
Well, you know puberty and all

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:28.460
Oh, there you go change of the years, yeah

01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:33.660
Yeah, you know what's super embarrassing is uh, like people who get into radio

01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:35.580
They would they would do these kinds

01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:41.100
They would do this kind of learning on like some obscure small little radio station in some small town

01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:44.300
Nobody'd ever hear about it. And then by the time they make it to national they're good

01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:47.020
But uh when you do it on the internet

01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:55.900
I mean my entire you can watch my entire learning arc just by watching our old shows. It's embarrassing. It's all out there

01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:57.340
Oh, thank you. We got

01:24:57.340 --> 01:24:59.360
All right. So voting is now fixed jbtitles.com

01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:05.980
And like what do you do right because you can't really pull it down because that's the back catalog which gets quite a bit of play

01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:11.980
But like there are people out there that are meeting chris for the first time and they're meeting that version of chris

01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:14.700
That's not the version. I want them to meet

01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:20.860
First of all, he weighs like 45 pounds more than I do and second of all, he apparently says um a lot

01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:23.820
He's he hasn't gotten into the flow of the rant yet

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:31.900
But the first version of chris that I met was unboxing a digital photo frame nice I remember that chris access point. Yes

01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:33.900
Yes

01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:41.580
It's uh similar to paul's video which got out on the internet and uh, no one can take it right

01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:46.460
It's the same as open source, isn't it? You're right about that. Oh, that doesn't make me feel any better though

01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:50.060
Not at all. Yeah, I remember that kodak picture frame. That was horrible

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:53.820
Was it terrible when you actually set it up?

01:25:53.820 --> 01:26:00.960
No, it was okay. It was okay. I know you had to um use a vista vm. Oh good old vista

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:08.860
I do remember some of that. Yeah. All right. So how are the titles shaking out now that we got the boats. Let's see

01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:11.500
Uh, let's see

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:16.940
Finger on the pulse of video. That's not bad. That's not bad opening dns from the past is boring better

01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:23.280
Not so minty fresh turn and I kind of like finger on the pulse of video, but it's a little obscure. Don't you think?

01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:29.740
Yeah, but uh, it's also not what it's called either so

01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:33.580
Well, there's that

01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:38.300
All right chat room, come on, we gotta get together everybody go there concentrate your votes

01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:44.140
We gotta go in the meantime. I want you to think about one thing and one thing only that is

01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:46.140
Mustache

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:49.440
What's driving me crazy is that photo right there zoom in on that

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:53.520
It's one of those cops in a black uniform with a mustache and you just look like an absolute clown freak

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:57.280
That works for murdering terrorists that jack our food and water. I think you're a big joke

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:05.840
Oh, you got a mustache i'll just worship you as long as you got a mustache. It's okay. Nothing against mustaches

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:09.040
It always makes me feel better

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:16.640
Uh ham, did you want to ask me now? Or did you want to ask off the air? Off the air is fine. Okay. All right

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:22.080
So jbtitles.com jbtitles.com jibber jibber jibber jibber jibber finger on the pulse of video is boring better

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:24.960
I don't think I want to do is boring better rotten just it's a good one

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:31.200
But I feel like it's territory the unplugged show has kind of analyzed before maybe with a new angle today

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:34.560
But if you're looking at it without knowing the context of the discussion, you might be judgy

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.800
I feel like that's why I also just suggested pinot noir

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.840
I like that. All right. Okay

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:47.040
Uh is finger on the pulse of video

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:51.200
Uh, I kind of like finger on the pulse of video. I think we're gonna go with finger on the pulse of video

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.200
How do we beat that? How do you beat that right?

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:56.160
Not so many first pretty good

01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.240
With wine. I like it

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.160
Yeah, I do like that too. Um, all right

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:04.320
Will somebody go out there and try the new linux mint 17.2 and then give us a review next week?

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.320
Does anybody in the mobile room mind doing that?

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:09.680
Anybody want to take that nobody going once

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:16.560
Going twice. Thank you, sir. Who is that? Who said that who we got that's romeo romeo. Thank you romeo anybody else

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:22.080
Anybody else i'll give it a go if no one's dead ubi you you give it a go

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:26.240
Wow, give it a go. What's the worst that can happen?

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:29.200
Poppy you get you get sucked in by the boringness

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:31.200
Poppy

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:37.840
I grabbed the uh torrents earlier on today and uh, I was sharing seeding like a good man

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:42.160
And uh, yeah, so i've got them locally. I might as well give it a go. All right, so

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:47.440
I just started using it sun's all okay. All right. So would you guys let's how about next tuesday?

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.960
Since you know, I mean we I talked my mouth off about the barbecue so I can do it there what?

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:56.480
I'm going to the to the barbecue if that's next tuesday, you're going to be here. You're going to show up

01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:03.600
I mean i'm in portland and there's a bus that goes straight up to seattle. So good man. That would be amazing

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.280
All right, so email me so I know though because if I get like two or three people to email me

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:09.280
I'll i'll get some food. Otherwise, i'm not going to buy food

01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:13.040
I've already emailed you about it. Awesome. So, uh, great

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:17.040
Yeah, so we'll talk about mint because I feel like we probably deserve to give it, you know a fair shake

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:20.480
Because you know, they've done some good work there and I just kind of s'd all over it

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:25.120
And uh, and we'll have some barbecues. That'll be fun 100 is gonna be awesome. I like it

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:30.000
All right. Thanks mumble room. Thanks for being here. I appreciate it. I can't I can't wait to watch all the food

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:39.520
Welcome to linux unplugged episode 99 where today we're going to be talking about text editors freestyle. What do you think?

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:42.560
Guess what i've tried yesterday

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.880
What'd you try yesterday

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:54.880
I have tried emacs among other things, uh, because i've also tried atom the text editor from

01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.520
Uh the guys over at github

01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:03.520
Um, i've tried sublime text 3 which is currently in alpha i've tried. Um,

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.880
Sublime text 2 which everybody seems to love and i'm an avid

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:11.280
vim user

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:14.240
So I have a lot to say about text editing right now

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:16.240
So what is your favorite choice now?

01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:18.880
um

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:21.040
See this is a really

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:24.480
tough question to answer because

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:26.560
I am

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:28.560
not a fan of

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:33.600
Vim style editing or vi style editing if that's what you want to call it

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:38.160
What I do like is my specific vim setup

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:40.560
so

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:44.080
I wouldn't mind moving to a different text editor if

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:50.480
It could provide me with what I already have and what I already like about my vim setup

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.440
that being said

01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:58.960
Transitioning to anything else is always kind of weird. So i've been

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:07.040
Every few months jumping around to different text editors and trying stuff out just just to see what all the different

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:13.280
have you tried light table because it seems to be that light table you can really have your own configuration like

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:19.440
You have in vima. So once you have your light table, uh configuration, you will never change it, I guess

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:24.720
It's well

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:28.160
It's light table the one that brackets is using

01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:32.320
Now if you want to change it, you have to go to vim.com

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:36.720
Light table the one that brackets is using

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:42.080
No, no, this was an independent crowdfunded project that is open source, I think

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.360
Well, it is open source that I know

01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:53.040
I'm looking at the website of light table right now and here's the issue that I see already

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:55.920
Is that it doesn't stand out in any way

01:31:55.920 --> 01:32:03.520
Well, it stand out becomes it comes into very basic settings and you have to push your settings afterward and create your own

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:10.240
Workflow, I guess. Oh, that's true about every text editor every ever made

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:13.600
Yeah, not that now what about nano though?

01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:16.400
Nano is cool

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:22.560
Because I mean like everybody talks about vim and emacs and sublime text, but I hardly ever hear about nano

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:29.840
So it's like nano the the newbie text editor or or what do you guys think about nano? Because I use nano quite often

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:35.040
Okay, so here's the thing. Nano is awesome. If you just need to edit a config

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:42.400
If you have your thousand lines of code file that you've been working on for a few months and you have to navigate around it

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:45.440
Just to find the function that you want to work on today

01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:50.240
Nano is not as good because

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:55.280
While basic features are there. It's not as powerful and not as extendable as

01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.880
Anything else that you could be using

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.320
I would come I would agree with you

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:11.600
Nano is great though. Um, like if you're going to have one text editor on on your system

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:15.280
You don't actually write a lot of stuff. You just edit configs

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.520
nano

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:19.040
Perfectly fine

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.040
Perfect fun

01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:25.520
So the best best command line editor, what would you say

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:29.760
Vim okay

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:32.160
Or emacs, okay

01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:37.760
How about gooey a gedit sublime text or I forget what the name of the kde one is

01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:39.840
But what about what do you think for gooey?

01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:42.480
gven

01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:47.440
So the text editor from kde, huh

01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:52.240
Uh, no, no. No, he said he said gooey version of vim

01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:58.320
Uh, I do like kate. I do really like kate. I wish there was a

01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:05.120
Bigger community around it that creates plugins for it because kate is awesome

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:12.240
And i'm already a kde user. I would love to spend time. Um

01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:15.040
more time in kate

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:17.040
that being said

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:20.800
Are we being stopped now or what's going on?

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:23.840
No, he agrees with you

01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:27.200
Ah, ah, okay. I let me have a sip of coffee

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:33.200
While he's drinking his coffee I would like to also point out that kate is awesome

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:37.760
Except for the fact that it has missing features and the only way to do them is to

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:41.520
The plugin system for kate is not that good and it's not

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:44.400
very extensible

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:50.000
Now she uses plugins g edit's got plugins and g edit also has

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:55.600
uh developer plugin packages and extra plugin packages that are easy to get from the

01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:02.480
Uh ubuntu software center or from the arch user repository, right? But by default g edit requires you to add everything

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:06.240
just that is true like just like emacs and just like vim you have to

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:12.720
You have to specify exactly what features you want and things like that where kate has a lot of cool things built in by default

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:17.520
Such as emit, um, uh block block editing, which is cool

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.080
uh, but then you know, there's other things I so use sublime text because um,

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:24.800
Well, there's nothing else that is remotely

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:30.080
As useful to me without having stupid bloat like adam

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:36.240
Wait, wait, wait. What's the stupid bloat in adam because as far as I can tell chromium atom

01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:42.160
Is it not chromium it's something else it's it's based on chromium

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:46.880
Isn't it? No way kid or something like that. No, it's chromium. It's literally chromium

01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:48.960
It even says it on their website that it is

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:54.480
Atom is based on chromium embedded framework. I actually have research into these when

01:35:54.800 --> 01:36:01.040
Brackets came about and pretty much it is a special build of chromium which strips out a couple features and makes a basic shell

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:05.600
Out of chromium so that you can start writing. Uh, the kind of the shell

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:13.060
Component and the browser component so you it's pretty much just the html javascript whatever but it's chromium. That's overall

01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:16.100
Um, yeah, there's that

01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:20.660
So what about genie just throw another gdk editor in the ground?

01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:23.380
It's cool, but it's very

01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:25.700
um lacking in features

01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:29.380
Yeah, and it's still gdk too. I think huh? Yes

01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:33.860
I don't care what toolkit it is as long as it works

01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:35.860
Yeah, that's an argument

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:37.940
I don't think

01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:45.460
No one like no one has ever gone excited over genie. I've talked to people who use it because it's good

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:48.100
but it's not like

01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:51.060
Anybody has ever had this

01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:53.060
devout

01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:57.940
Uh love for for genie like people have for vim emacs or sublime

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:02.180
Wasn't wimpy talking last week about genie

01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:06.340
Yes, he uses genie, but he also uses more than just genie. So

01:37:07.540 --> 01:37:09.540
Yeah, so most of us probably

01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:12.100
I mean

01:37:12.340 --> 01:37:14.100
But it's it's

01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:17.620
Genie is like gedit by default with cool extra features, but still

01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:20.340
still very limited

01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:23.220
Okay, genie my perspective is a very simple ide

01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:29.300
It's perfect in paten because it does symbol searching it integrates that and gives you auto completion of symbols already seen

01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:32.500
But other than that is not that appealing to change it

01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:36.900
You probably want to use genie when you don't want to make much changes and you want something simple

01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:42.180
But other than that, honestly talking about editors when in the discussion there's things like sublime

01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:46.180
Evim or emacs genie simply does not hold water

01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:54.100
So with text editors, is there one text editor that is the best you should always use it virtually

01:37:54.100 --> 01:38:00.820
No matter what you're doing or is it similar to like paint programs where you have gimp which is super powerful?

01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:05.780
Or then you have pinta which you might want to just use if you have like a simple, you know

01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:09.940
Want to resize image or so because that's not a good comparison this this

01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:14.500
The editor of conversation is more like the distro conversation there

01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:19.300
Most of them are all great for different for like for different preferences people

01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:23.940
No emacs and vim both have great features. And yes, you're going to

01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:28.900
So you're going to just go not just because not but not because i'm an emacs guys

01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:35.140
But it's more like when looking at infrastructure alone what actually one is capable versus the other

01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:41.380
Yes, people have managed to make vim to work with things that you know, and it's kind of amazing that it actually works

01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:48.100
But looking at alone at the infrastructure that allows to plug in things to change things by a plug-in interface

01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:55.540
Emacs is more powerful one thing or not being you a vim user that performs vim style and vim works better for you or not

01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.760
Architecturally emacs is a superior editor period. There's no argument

01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:07.220
Not as much

01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:12.580
With every aspect of supply can be modified with a plug-in

01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:21.540
Okay, here's my issue with sublime and atom is that I don't really see a difference on the text level editor. Yeah

01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:25.380
Whatever atom is using from itself. It might be

01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:28.820
Answer the phone

01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:31.540
Yeah

01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:33.960
Uh ham answer the phone

01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:35.960
Oh

01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:42.040
Hi guys, thanks for all hi, can I come back to me to start the show now you guys did good though

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:45.720
That was solid. That was awesome. But it is now time to start the show. You should do that

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:48.680
Let's do that every pre-show. We'll call it the we'll call oh my god

01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:51.240
What if we put a podcast within a podcast?

01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:55.240
Like the mumble action show and you guys just show up in the pre-show and you have a show

01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:58.680
And then we'll just put that in there and we should do that you show up next week and do it again

01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:00.760
We'll do it every time until you stop showing up. Okay

01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:08.200
Okay. Well, if the mumble community is going to uh do a show you have to accept the fact that once in a while

01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:10.280
There's going to be a special episode

01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:12.900
exclusively about feces

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:17.160
I hope so. I hope so

01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:22.040
Oh, yeah, we should call it mumble unplugged, right? It should be mumble unplugged. It'll be during the pre-show

01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:23.560
It'll be like our warm-up show

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:26.040
It's like, you know how like when before a band comes out, you know

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:29.160
You have a pre-show they're like you guys could be like it could be the mumble action show or the mumble

01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:34.200
It should be mumble unplugged or maybe chris unplugged because my mic's off and you guys get to have the show

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:37.880
I don't get to say anything. Apparently according to zfs for the win

01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:42.360
I can't use the soundboard either because apparently the soundboard equals commentary. Um

01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:47.320
I didn't know but I think I agree the more you know the more you know

01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:51.960
I guess it does add a little context, uh to the uh show and so out of that that's how we go

01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:55.320
That's how we roll. I'll respect that. I won't I won't use the soundboard

01:40:55.320 --> 01:41:00.200
I'll mute my mic and you guys can have mumble unplugged and then I think we should probably call it mumble unplugged

01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:03.800
And it's the unplugged mumble show in the in the unplugged show. It's meta

01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:25.320
It's like it's perfect. It's it's perfect for our community
