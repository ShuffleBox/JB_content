1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So who wants to tell us about OggCamp?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Because over here on the stateside, we don't get to hear much about it.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So who wants to tell us about it?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Poppy, you want to start?

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I think so.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Poppy should start because I'm an OggCamp newbie.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
All right, Poppy.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You've been going since...

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What, during the show or pre-show?

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, well, I mean, if you talk about it right now, we'll include it in the show.

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So it'll be actually in the show.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So it's got a really ridiculous name, OggCamp.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But it came about in 2009 when the Lug Radio Live stopped happening.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And the people who ran Ubuntu UK podcast and Linux Outlaws.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So that's, you know, all the Fabian Schirschel, Dan Lynch, myself, Laura, Tony and so on.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We all wanted to continue having a UK-based free culture, free software, you know, unconference type thing.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So when you say, this is something I've wondered, when you say culture, is that like Creative Commons music and things like that?

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Or what does culture kind of mean?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah, it can mean that.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It can mean anything.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It could mean electronics.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Maker stuff.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah, exactly.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I mean, it's evolved into some of that as well.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I mean, at the first one, we had someone who was doing analysis of people's psychology by the way they draw a picture of a pig or something as a presentation.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Awesome. That sounds really fun.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This year, a few years later, we had a teletype that would print out anything that you tweet at it, which was brilliant.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You know, it's like a full-on mix of technology from the 1950s and technology from now, you know, being able to tweet at a thing that would print your tweets out forevermore.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The Linux Voice guys were there, loads of other people doing exhibition stuff.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There was loads of kids there.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
People who came along to the event brought their children along and it's a safe environment for people to bring their children.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I gave a presentation about Ubuntu Phone while kids were eating their lunch and walking.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Booing in the background.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah, I was having to step over them while I was giving my presentation, but it was all fine.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That sounds really neat.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And you were saying earlier it's a really friendly atmosphere.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's about 400 or so people, right? Or in that range.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It depends each year, but yeah, it can vary between about 200 and 400.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And, you know, that's a really good size where it's big enough where you can still meet new people for sure.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But see people that you like, this is kind of like your chance to see them again.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And, you know, the other thing is we are about to today, we're going to talk about all this internet drama, right?

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And I'll tell you one thing that I cannot put a value on quite right yet.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But something that I have noticed every time I go to one of these conferences, Linux Fest or OSCON or whatever.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Sometimes I walk away with something I didn't expect at all.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Like this last time I made two really great contacts at OSCON that I'm still talking to them.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And we're developing some new show ideas that are really exciting that I didn't go to OSCON expecting that to happen at all.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
They walked up to me at the conference and we started a dialogue.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And same thing like, you know, like I really the only time I ever get to see Blaster is when we're at a conference.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And it has the side effect of kind of reenergizing people creatively and refocusing them on the actual work.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Like the social interaction, you walk away from that with a new vigor for the mission.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And I think so often like we're going to talk about the drama today.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I think so often that is the lacking piece is that we as human beings are not particularly good at this form of communication over a long period.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We can use it to fill in gaps, but there is something about that physical meat space.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And the reason why I think this is a big deal is because I was somebody who thought that was crap for a really long time.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I thought technology was finally going to flatten the world and solve this problem.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You know, I thought webcams and Google Hangouts and Skype and all of that would solve this.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But it is not still quite the same.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You know, the video helps, but there's just something about like going to an event, working together for the event,

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
being there as a group, you know, all of the effort that's involved with that,

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
that the mass amount of all working together that happens right in that moment,

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
that sort of reconnects that work ethic and all of those things.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's almost an intangible value, but it's so important.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And having a meal with someone too.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah, right. Yeah.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And projects start at conferences like that.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I know at least two projects which are in embryonic stage that have resulted out of conversations at our camp.

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Stuart Langridge talked about having a portable device in your pocket that you could use for giving presentations.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He's called it Splinter.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And he started a whole project around developing a device so you don't have to carry your laptop to a conference.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You just plug this device into a projector and then use your phone to wirelessly cast your presentation.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hold on now. Now he's stepping on Ubuntu Touch.

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's what I want my Ubuntu Touch device to do.

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Well, it's good.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Give me HDMI output and I'm good.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And then we had a guy from Mozilla, James Huggman.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He's a fantastic and lovely guy.

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He was talking about the offline world and going completely offline

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and how someone in a remote village in the middle of nowhere

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
manages to keep in contact with people in the next village or people around the world

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and how we should enable offline access to information and services.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
These are things I just would not have thought of going to.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So to dovetail with that, Poppy, I've been exchanging emails and had long conversations with James as a result of meeting him at Ogg Camp

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
because the extreme offline being in a remote rural location where you're connected to the internet by a shortwave radio

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
means that I have some experience in how you get online.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He was asking about that and I looked around to find you in the presentation when he was talking about that.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I went to see his second presentation and had a chat with him afterwards

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and I've put him in touch with the people that I worked with.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Colonel Linux was talking about the Microtech devices and how they have all of the bits of that jigsaw that can be fitted together to solve this problem.

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That is particularly... He gave me one of those.

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But he gave it to me right when I was doing the studio move and I put it in a box somewhere and it's so damn small I cannot find it.

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But that's what I think I want to do for my firewall here at the studio, but I'm still... I don't know, PF Sensor, I just don't know.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Just one last follow-up from the Ogg Camp thing there. You were asking about the free culture up front.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm just about to post it into the IRS now.

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
There were these guys there, Pepper Top, and they make Creative Commons sci-fi web comics.

95
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Oh, this is great.

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I had a good long chat with them. They make really good quality material.

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And the best bit was they went, oh, you're a Marte developer. We use Marte for our entire workflow.

98
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
No way.

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And they were all in the front row of my presentation, all smiling and beaming away.

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is great. This is really, really... So are they doing like this with Inkscape and all that?

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah, the whole thing is open source, top to bottom, and all of the assets are freely available.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So the other thing I was helping them with was sorting out their hosting,

103
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
because they need large-scale storage and lots of bandwidth to distribute this stuff.

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Geez, I bet. Maybe they should talk to Alan, too.

105
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And they're the guys that do the comic in Linux Voice as well.

106
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This is really... See, this is that. That's exactly kind of what I was thinking.

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And that's fun, because I think as Linux gets, I don't know, boring, but as the desktop gets boring,

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I've been in LAS trying to shift the discussion not to so much about stats and features about Linux

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and why Linux is better than Windows and all of that, but more about,

110
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
okay, well, let's just assume you're on Linux now for a reason, and everybody has their own reason.

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Now, what the hell can you do with it?

112
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And this is... I would love to get these guys on LAS and talk to them,

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
because I want to showcase in the Linux Action Show more, this is what Linux can enable you to do.

114
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And if you thought you couldn't do this on Linux before, well, now you can.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's hit and miss. I try to put a little bit into each segment, a little bit,

116
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
but I'd really like to showcase it more.

117
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I can totally put you in touch, because they're actually going to write an article for the Marte desktop

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
to explain how they're using the Marte desktop and why they've chosen to use it

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
as an essential part of their workflow.

120
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But the flip side of this is that the Ubuntu Marte project,

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
something that I'm working on at the moment, is precisely what you've just described.

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Once you've got this Linux computer in front of you, what do you use it for?

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So I'm starting to curate something that looks like an app store, but there's no money involved.

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And it's for people that are familiar with the app store content to have web-installable apps and content.

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So Poppy and I discussed this idea of a trimmed-down version of the Software Center

126
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
with just those essential app picks that describe if you want a tool to do vector graphics,

127
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
then you click the Inkscape icon.

128
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Don't tease me. Do not do this to me. Don't do this to me. Come on, guys, don't do this.

129
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The follow-on from that is a content section which links you to Creative Commons, albums, books, comics, art, and all of that stuff.

130
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yes, yes, comics, yes, please, please. Oh my, you are blowing my mind right now.

131
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You know that GIF with the guy with the fireworks in his mind? That's me right now.

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I have never understood why we do not have some of that stuff in a Linux store like this. Oh my gosh.

133
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But it's not a store. It looks like an app store. It's just a way to discover stuff.

134
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And every week we'll announce one new thing, so a new application one week, a new album the next week,

135
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
a book the week after that, some artwork or something like that.

136
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You know, the thing that I use an app store for – we've got to come up with a different term, really – but the thing that I use these sort of app stores for

137
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
is really the discovery. All right, I've sort of played with my stuff. I kind of want to see if something's new.

138
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And honestly, for a long time I did use – well, for a while I used the Software Center like that.

139
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And that is one of the things I find more appealing on iOS than Android.

140
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Although, don't freak out, because if you want to hear my thoughts on Android, go listen to this week's quarter radio.

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
L is awesome. But in iOS, I can pop open that app store, and they do really good at that curation.

142
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And I just look at the curated ones. I'm like, yeah, that looks good enough. Pop. And I grab it.

143
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And I used to do that in the Software Center. But it doesn't need to be a quote-unquote app.

144
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It would be awesome if it was a comic book. I was looking at the Monsters, Inc. or one of the comics that you just linked us to, Wimpy.

145
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And I was thinking, I'd like to read this with my son. I would like to be able to go on, download something that – okay, I want to back up.

146
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So I'm a big believer in you should put your money where your vote is.

147
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And I think sometimes we get all worked up about Netflix on Linux and ripping Blu-ray and all this stuff.

148
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And in my opinion, it's like what we really need to do is just stop buying it.

149
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's a bad habit. It has been manufactured to make us want it using a combination of the best abilities of Hollywood to make this stuff,

150
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
combined with the best marketing in the world, literally in the world.

151
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And so it is very enticing. And I totally understand that because I like this stuff too.

152
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But if you really want DRM to start up, you have to stop buying their stuff. Period. End of story.

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And the thing is, is there is a lot of good Creative Commons music.

154
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There is a lot of good work out there that is free that people are giving away.

155
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Just like in podcasts where people are downloading TV shows and movies.

156
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And meanwhile, podcast content creators are giving away their content for free that is absolutely legal for you to use that you can redistribute.

157
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Just like in podcasts, the same thing is true in video series.

158
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
There are people making TV shows online that are completely Creative Commons and free.

159
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
There are people making music and books and audiobooks and comic books.

160
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We do not do a good job of exposing it. There are websites out there, but they are not very popular.

161
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And they are often not very well designed either. And their search usually sucks.

162
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So what you are saying right now is you are going to try to solve some of that and put it in a nice application on my Linux desktop?

163
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
On a website. On a website that is open to a multi-website.

164
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So how do you trigger like a, would it just be like a downloading of a demo?

165
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It could easily be a contained website within a view and then you download a deb or the content that is easily unpackable.

166
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It could be a zip file with a bunch of mp3s in it. It does not have to be a deb.

167
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I just put a link in the chat room to Brad Sucks. He is basically an artist.

168
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Brad Sucks?

169
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah, he is an artist who has a lot, all of his music, he claims it as open source because you can actually erase the tracks if you want to.

170
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And you know, I just take this moment to point out that the Jupiter Broadcasting shows are creative commons, share alike, with attribution.

171
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah, there you go. Easy. I do not know if people know, but there it is.

172
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I think Wimpy is being rather conservative saying new content once a week.

173
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I think you could quite easily up the rotation and, you know, have a comic on Monday, an audio file on a Tuesday, an application on a Wednesday.

174
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You know, you could you could certainly theme each day of the week, even if you only did it for the five working days.

175
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah, and the thing is, is in order to do that, I'm going to have to get some community involvement in order to actually do that.

176
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Is there a way to make, you know, like it seems like in this day and age, you could almost, there should be a way where if something was requested enough or submitted enough or something like that, that it would maybe pop up on a list and then you could approve it or something, right?

177
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
There seems like there should be a system.

178
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It could be curated.

179
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah, it can be.

180
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I mean, I've been using the community to give me direction on where the project's going already by holding votes and polls on decisions about what should be default applications, default settings and things of that nature.

181
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And what I'm thinking is using, because the community is growing quite rapidly, is actually asking them, tell me about some of your favorite Creative Commons music, TV, podcasts, books, comics, and actually using them to get the ideas.

182
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But the whole Ubuntu Mate website is all marked down and it's all rendered using a conversion script. So you don't need people that are super techie in order to actually add content to the website.

183
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So I'm hoping that I'll be able to open that up so that they can actually add the content.

184
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Gosh, you guys are speaking my language right now. This is awesome. This is really freaking exciting.

185
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's not coming this release though. It's after 14.10, this idea.

186
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugs, your weekly Linux talk show that is powered by an inappropriate amount of Snapple Tea. My name is Chris.

187
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And my name is Matt.

188
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Hey there, Matt. I hope you brought your wine and cheese for this week's episode because there's a little drama in today's show.

189
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I seem to be a magnet for that lately. I know how you are about the drama. It's like your favorite thing ever, right?

190
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh yeah, I love it.

191
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You keep a little log of all the drama that's going on so you can check back up on it because what you like to do, Matt, is spend a lot of time and energy on it, right?

192
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah, absolutely. Apparently that's what I do. It seems like I'm drawn into it.

193
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I don't know if we're going to be able to accomplish my goal today, but I want to discuss some of the things that are going on in the Linux community that from the outside might look like we're ripping apart.

194
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And maybe we could talk a little bit about what we think we could do differently.

195
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And maybe we'll talk a little bit about if this really is a problem from the top as it has recently been put by Mr. Pottering that sometimes the fish rots from the head down.

196
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Is that really true? Can we blame all of the recent drama on Mr. Torvalds? We'll discuss that as well.

197
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Plus, we've got some news we're going to get to and, as always, some feedback.

198
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So, Matt, we are armed to bear with a huge Mumble Room today. Hey, Mumble Room, how you guys doing? Everybody just say hi. It's going to be nuts for a second. Just say hi.

199
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Hi. Hello.

200
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Now that's kind of musical. That was almost kind of beautiful.

201
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You guys have been hanging out way too much. You guys harmonize. What the hell?

202
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Alright, so our first email comes in this week from viewer Mark.

203
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And Mark writes in and he says, I had a suggestion for that Mumble Room.

204
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Now, this is totally optional, guys, so we're going to start with this.

205
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:15,000
This is just kind of putting this out there, but Mark suggests a distro for the community to review. It's called PlayLinux.

206
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It is a distribution that is entirely designed for gamers. You can find it at play-linux.com.

207
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
He thought it would be good for the unplugged group to go through this one.

208
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So I checked it out a little bit. I'll pull it up if you're watching the video version here.

209
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
First of all, it has a really interesting website design compared to most Linux distributions.

210
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's really well done. To me, it looks like it's directly appealing to folks that have heard about this Linux thing.

211
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It can play Steam. And right here at the beginning, you get an Ubuntu logo, a game controller logo, and their logo.

212
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And it makes it pretty simple.

213
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So Mumble Room, I know not all of you are big gamers. Is this something you'd be interested in trying?

214
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Does anybody want to step up and say, yeah, I'd take a look at PlayLinux?

215
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yeah, sure.

216
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Alright.

217
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
My reaction would be this is the dumbest idea ever.

218
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Right. So that's fine. If that's what you think, that's fair.

219
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I have to agree there, Popeye.

220
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yeah. So we have Eric and Popeye willing to check it out.

221
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
No, no. I'm willing to say this is the dumbest idea ever.

222
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Oh, don't check it out. I'll just tell you a little bit about it.

223
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It uses Cinnamon for the desktop.

224
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It basically looks like it's Mint because it's using MDM, the Mint desktop manager for the login.

225
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It comes with Spotify. It comes with their own installer for Skype and a few other of their own tools.

226
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It looks like they're integrating some of their own tools with it, though.

227
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So there could be some uniqueness. No? Going once?

228
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You know, they had me until I realized they had LibreOffice installed.

229
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Why the hell would you have LibreOffice on a gaming distro?

230
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Oh, ouch, ouch.

231
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Well, I'm just saying. I was like, okay, I'm feeling it. I'm flowing.

232
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Wait, what now? And they kind of lost me at that point.

233
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I got one thing.

234
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Okay.

235
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
For me, this seems like another partition I'm going to have to put on my drive to have another thing to dual boot to.

236
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Why on earth would I want to do that when I'm trying to stop doing that?

237
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I guess, yeah, if you were going to have a dedicated Linux installation for gaming, you might just go Steam OS, right?

238
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Steam is stupidly easy to install.

239
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Right.

240
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Why would you even bother?

241
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And then if you were going to use the installation for much else, you'd probably just go with straight Linux.

242
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Well, I think it depends on the point in time you're installing Steam and what tool you're using to install it,

243
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
because, I mean, there's certainly been some history there.

244
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
But these days, I would say yes.

245
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Although, I'm not as critical of the idea as you guys are.

246
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I actually think giving folks a really clear path for landing when they're coming to Linux to game is a pretty good idea.

247
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You know, one of the things we discovered when working with our buddy Chase and getting him to switch over to Linux

248
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:53,000
was for him, and I still am kind of gobsmacked by this, but for him, the big barrier was there was too many distros,

249
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and he didn't want to pick the wrong one.

250
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And to me, and just from my light trolling of Linux underscore gaming on Reddit,

251
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
it seems like about once a week or so, there's somebody that comes in and says,

252
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
hey, what's the best distro for gaming?

253
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And so if there was something we could just say, go get this, it's based on Ubuntu 14.04,

254
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
it comes pre-installed with a Skype installer and all the stuff you need.

255
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It has Cinnamon, so it looks a lot like Windows 7.

256
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You would recommend Ubuntu over Steam OS?

257
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Well, if they wanted to do anything else besides game, right?

258
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Like if they wanted to use it as a desktop OS.

259
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
If they wanted to use it as a desktop, why don't they just go straight up Ubuntu?

260
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Well, I mean, yes, obviously.

261
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Or any other distro.

262
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But I'm talking about people that are going to be trying to discover this on their own.

263
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
They're not going to have the host of the Linux action show to ask what distro to install, right?

264
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
They're going to have to go find out on their own.

265
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So you're saying that you have someone that's, gaming is their primary focus.

266
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Anything else is basically secondary, but this is basically mostly for gaming.

267
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah. Plus, I want to also make it clear.

268
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I think some of it's a little smoke and mirrors.

269
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Like, yeah, this is a distro optimized for gaming.

270
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So go get it, gamer, because it's optimized.

271
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
When really it's just Linux, right?

272
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But it's a little bit of marketing.

273
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Yeah, it's a little marketing too.

274
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Because we want to make Linux look like an awesome place to switch to.

275
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So if we have a distro that's optimized for gaming, that might work.

276
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
They have some cool ideas with having wine and wine tricks and play Linux all installed at the same time, like for you.

277
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That'd be nice, but I think the distro method is not practical.

278
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
If they just did like a package, you could install all these at once and they did it for you.

279
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That would be awesome.

280
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Now Wimpy brings up a good point.

281
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Go ahead, Wimpy.

282
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh, right. Hang on. I'll just hit return again.

283
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yeah, I was curious.

284
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Are you allowed to redistribute Steam?

285
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So if you've created your distribution and you install Steam before it's done its unpacking, you know, downloading, unpacking, are you allowed to redistribute that?

286
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
As I understand it, yes.

287
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yeah, did they specifically?

288
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
This was asked by all the other distros.

289
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:07,000
When Steam came out and there was a big brouhaha that it was all about Ubuntu and they would recommend Ubuntu, every other distro got a little bit butthurt.

290
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And they asked Valve if it was OK for them to redistribute Steam and the general answer is yes.

291
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
No, actually, I think Valve even updated the EULA to reflect that, didn't they?

292
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm not talking about redistributing in repositories.

293
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I mean actually a distribution pre-installed with that little downloader installer gizmo.

294
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You don't need to though. All you need is that you just need the stub and you're done.

295
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Because it doesn't matter when you make the ISO because Valve are going to put out an update between them in the time it takes you to download the ISO.

296
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Most of the time in Arch when I install Steam from the repository, Steam launches and then just does a self-update and then it like pulls down the Ubuntu environment and all that.

297
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I think someone said earlier, why does it have a LibreOffice? It's probably because of the tagline.

298
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
That's true and I guess it's something people recognize. Includes Office, I guess it's a checkbox thing.

299
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Spotify again. So Final Call, is anybody interested in giving this?

300
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Eric, you seem like you might be interested, right?

301
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Do you have a machine to load it on? If you don't want to, you don't have to. It's totally voluntary.

302
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I can easily use Clonezilla so I've got a partition, no big deal.

303
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We should do a segment on that. Alright, so anybody else interested in reviewing this? Anybody?

304
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Going once, going twice. Alright Eric, I'll leave it. If you feel like doing it, no pressure.

305
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
But if you feel like doing it and want to come back next week and tell us about it and let us know how it went, I'd be really curious.

306
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I actually don't think it's that bad of an idea as long as they get it right.

307
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Alright, so FakeMoth wants to get us all fired up.

308
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Microsoft just isn't the boogeyman it used to be.

309
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:57,000
How about we tell you a little tale of government corruption and Microsoft buying off folks to do what they do best.

310
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Sell more software and get people hooked.

311
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
But before we get to that, I want to tell you about our first sponsor this week.

312
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That's the great folks over at Ting. Go to linux.ting.com so that way the Linux Unplugged show gets a little bit of credit for your visit.

313
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And you get a $25 credit on your Ting account if you have a compatible phone.

314
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And if you don't have a phone yet, well they'll take $25 off your first phone.

315
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'll talk about that more here in just a second.

316
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Linux.ting.com. Everybody go there right now. Linux.ting.com.

317
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's my mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider.

318
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And I think after all this time, the thing that really stands out about Ting is really the huge savings has come in paying for what I use.

319
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm not at my two-year mark yet, but it is truly unbelievable to see the savings difference by switching to Ting.

320
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So I have three phones. I have an iPhone 5, I have an HTC One, and a Nexus 5.

321
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
All on my Ting account. And two of the phones get heavy usage.

322
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
One of the phones, well one of them is Rekai. He doesn't get a lot of usage.

323
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But oh Rekai, I'm just teasing. He's all on the Wi-Fi, that's why.

324
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Actually Rekai uses it a ton, but he uses it on Wi-Fi.

325
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
This is, by the way, a huge advantage to Ting.

326
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Because if you are at an office place, or at home, where you have Wi-Fi most of the time,

327
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
why are you paying for data and minutes that you will hardly use?

328
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Just in case you might go over? That sounds like a scam to me.

329
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And that's where Ting is different. You only pay for your usage.

330
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It's a flat $6 a month for your line. That just gets you the line right there.

331
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That's unbelievable, just starting there.

332
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And then it's just your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

333
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Individually, whatever you use, Ting just adds it up at the end of the month.

334
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Whatever bucket you fall into is what you pay.

335
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So for me, for three lines, for three smartphones, it's like $40 something on average right now.

336
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I don't know, I actually, it's literally low enough that I just don't care.

337
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Like if it was in the hundreds, I absolutely would care.

338
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And because I'm still looking back from when I had a traditional mobile carrier

339
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
where I was paying like $140 after taxes a month,

340
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
the fact that I'm paying $100 less a month, it blows my mind.

341
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
And on top of that, if that wasn't enough, then you have Ting's customer service.

342
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
They have a no-hold customer service if you call them between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. on business days.

343
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
You just call them at 1-855-TING-FTW, and a real human being actually answers the phone.

344
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,000
But the best part is, these human beings are like smartphone geeks that Ting has hired because they love smartphones.

345
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Like these are the people that in their family and friends and community groups, they were the tech person,

346
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
so Ting hires them to come do their tech support.

347
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So then you end up talking to somebody who likely knows Android better than you do.

348
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Yeah, I know, I don't mean to offend, but it's very likely.

349
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm talking these are enthusiasts. That's genius.

350
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But for me, because I'm a busy guy and I usually don't get to this stuff until late at night

351
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
when everybody's asleep and it's way after business hours,

352
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
well, they give me the tools to make sure I have control over my account.

353
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Ting has an awesome dashboard with a great heads-up display that gives you like feel usage

354
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
so you can see like your minutes and your messages and your megabytes all right there.

355
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And not only that, but Ting will be like, hey, bro, this was your average last month,

356
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
and this is kind of where you're trending at right now.

357
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Here's your highs, here's your lows, this is where we think you might be.

358
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And it's brilliant. It is absolutely brilliant.

359
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And right there in the Ting dashboard, I can turn a device on or off.

360
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I love that aspect of Ting.

361
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So here's what I want you to do. Go to linux.ting.com right now.

362
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Click on that savings calculator. Put your actual cellular usage in there,

363
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
you know, which you actually use, and click that calculate savings right there.

364
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm just saying you might be surprised at the amount of money you could save.

365
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You'll likely be able to buy a laptop every two years by switching to Ting.

366
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And right now over on the Ting blog, they have their another Ting contributor's top five app picks.

367
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh, I'll have to tell Ang about MapMyWalk. They have some good ones over. Yeah.

368
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Yeah. Oh, okay. We see you have somebody a little... Oh, yeah. Okay. All right.

369
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
So go over there. Go to linux.ting.com and check out the blog.

370
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
They have another top five app picks.

371
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And by the way, if you've been kind of on the fence about switching to Ting,

372
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
they're moving warehouses, they're getting a bigger facility, and while they move,

373
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
they're like, we really would rather not move these devices.

374
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
If you would like to buy them, we will sell them really cheap.

375
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And so they have a great deal on the notes and even the feature phones.

376
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It's some incredible savings. And remember, if you go to linux.ting.com,

377
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
you're going to get a $25 discount.

378
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So go check them out right now. And they're also now taking the iPhone 5S and 5C.

379
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So if you've got an extra one of those now, you can move it over to Ting and get a $25 credit.

380
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
linux.ting.com. And a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged Show.

381
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Okay. So you ready for this Microsoft corruption story, as it were?

382
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Jake Moth sends this in. He says, hello, I'm a big fan of Vlas and Techsnap here in Romania.

383
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You know, the country that has gigabit Ethernet speeds every house for years because our ISPs all use Unix.

384
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Well, it seems no one is paying attention.

385
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So this is going to be a long email because he's got to get the word out.

386
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
In fact, he expresses his frustration that nobody's talking about this.

387
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I've been working in the IT field for 10 plus years, and I'm very passionate about technology and open source.

388
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
The problem is I consider myself a moral person.

389
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And for years, it's sickened me to work in corporate IT sales.

390
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I know I'm avoiding this area, but he says it's hell and doing anything else in IT is also hell.

391
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:23,000
He seems to have a hard time with IT, but he says, I've been watching something from afar that I've been witnessing with my own eyes that is driving me crazy.

392
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Microsoft is buying out our government. It's a whole food chain. Make no mistake.

393
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:34,000
The problem started back in 2001 when Romania began buying equipment and licenses for the education department.

394
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Since then, all other institutions like the police, the Justice Department, the army, everyone,

395
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:51,000
also then started buying Microsoft licenses at 200 to 300 percent of the market price and more licenses than computers they had to run them.

396
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Hundreds of thousands of licenses, Windows licenses, client access licenses, office licenses, SQL licenses.

397
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Simply put, instead of paying less for education and government, or at least for the high volume they were buying,

398
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Romania paid at least double the highest regular price on the market. Why? Simple. Corruption.

399
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Now the USA and the Romanian DNA, which stands for National Agency Against Corruption, I don't know why they don't put the C in there.

400
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I guess they just like DNA as the acronym. They have discovered an offshore account through which the payments have been made to various Romanian officials,

401
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
allegedly by Microsoft, because all of them have been tracked back to the US Microsoft headquarters.

402
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Also, Fujitsu and Siemens seem to be in on it, so perhaps that's where the hardware sales are going.

403
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
He says, I'm surprised that the international press doesn't talk much about this.

404
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:53,000
We're talking about tens of millions of euros lost by the state. Around 30 millions are only on the provable bribes, on the provable ones.

405
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:01,000
He says, the huge benefits for Microsoft and their local partners, mainly Sevco, are licenses bought even though when it wasn't necessary to do so.

406
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
He says, thanks for the great shows. Keep them going. Best wishes. Fake Moth from Romania.

407
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
So anybody surprised by this? And how can open source ever compete with that? How can that ever happen?

408
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It's an old hat. It's an old hat. There are more blades overseas though.

409
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So, Dara Devlin, I'd like to get your European perspective on this.

410
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So, the first thing I'll say is, this is most likely actually something the Romanian government wants to be able to have a justification to increase their actually hardware.

411
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Oh, interesting. We have all these licenses, now let's buy the hardware to use them.

412
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Yes, so it is a process of technology modernization. A lot of governments actually do this.

413
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And then I don't think it will actually be a long term problem because Romania is going through the process of being more integrated with the rest of the European Union.

414
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
The result is there is going to be more tighter controls.

415
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So, get that money. Yes, you're doing that, but also notice some of this money is not necessarily coming only from Romania.

416
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It's coming from all European services, but eventually it will kind of standardize and put in equal footing.

417
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
So, we've seen this in the past and things eventually worked out.

418
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So, it's kind of like they're taking advantage of the situation while they can, but in the end it will all wash out?

419
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Yes, I think it's unavoidable because people not only get tired, it's also that time that Microsoft no longer has the play it had.

420
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Yeah, that's very true and they really no longer have a lot of the same arguments they had.

421
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
The big one used to be office interoperability.

422
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It was unquestionable that if you were in, this is just from my experience in contracting in the Seattle area, so this may be a little skewed, but in my recollection,

423
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:04,000
when you were a business there was an assumed cost with every PC, Mac or Windows that you would have to buy Office because you had to be interoperable.

424
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,000
That's no longer really the case with LibreOffice's converters working very well and Google Docs and Office 365 even.

425
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Just that right there has fundamentally undermined the relevancy because it changes the conversation from unquestionable,

426
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:25,000
it's associated with the cost of buying a new PC, to it just changes the dialogue to do we really need this?

427
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I don't know if we need this for this station.

428
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
That right there is huge and it's just going to continue.

429
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Of course, Windows 10 will turn it all around, I'm sure.

430
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Bernardo writes in and I didn't roll this story in because I figured everybody's going to think Chris is an Arch fanboy,

431
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:55,000
so I avoided even talking about this, plus statistics and all of that, but Bernardo writes in and just points it out and wonders if it's a trend.

432
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
He says, hello Chris, hello Matt.

433
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You probably already noticed this, but I read an article on Ferronix in which it says that Arch Linux is about to overtake Ubuntu's first position in the benchmark usage,

434
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
so i.e. distributions that are running the open benchmark software.

435
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Right now, Ubuntu has been dominant.

436
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Now here is the interesting thing though.

437
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
This, who knows, right?

438
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
But if you look at this chart, that's actually kind of telling in a sense.

439
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:36,000
For those of you not watching the video version, it is unmistakable that as the Ubuntu decline has been in there, the Arch is increased.

440
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Now, what do you think we are to take from this?

441
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Is it perhaps folks who are benchmarking their machines have more custom builds so they've sort of migrated to Arch?

442
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
See, I would disagree with that to an extent, but that seems like it's a potential answer.

443
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Matt, do you have any theories right off the top of your head on this?

444
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Not really. It's one of those things I would want to watch more and dive deeper into before I start inserting myself on that, but it's definitely something to keep an eye on.

445
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Yeah, what I wonder is if it really is indicative of anything.

446
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I think the only way you could say it is if you saw several other kinds of trends where other sites and other things are observing the same thing.

447
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I think for benchmarks in particular, that's a hard one.

448
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,000
That seems like something that particularly Arch folks, because you're going to have a lot of folks that are building a custom rig, right?

449
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And then they want to get the most out of that. They're going to want the latest kernel and all of that stuff.

450
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So it seems like they would skew more towards Arch.

451
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Now, that kind of supports my theory that perhaps Arch is becoming the new distro of the more advanced Linux user, the more long-term experienced Linux user.

452
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I don't know. Anybody else have any other thoughts on this?

453
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
No? All right. All right. Okay, go ahead, Matt. Give it to Matt, and then we'll go to Wimpy next.

454
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Just real quick, I was going to tell you that if you stop and think about it, benchmarking is a lot like trying to measure a river with a ruler or a yardstick.

455
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Theoretically, you can do it, but you might not always get the most accurate results, especially depending on which end of the river you happen to be measuring from.

456
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So there's a lot of truth to that, and I think we're kind of looking at the same thing.

457
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It's one of these things to where it can become an absolute thing real quick, and I'm not real clear that we have all the details yet.

458
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yeah, but that sounds like an Alaskanism. I like that, Matt.

459
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Oh, absolutely.

460
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Wimpy, you were going to make a point, and then I'll go to Poppy next.

461
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Yeah, I was just going to say that if you were into doing benchmarks, then Arch Linux is a sensible platform to run your benchmarks on because you've always got the latest stuff.

462
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You've got the latest kernel, the latest file system user space, the latest drivers, the latest X.

463
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So if you want to see what's changing and what's improving, then doing it on Arch would be the platform to use because it's low barrier of entry to actually get the latest stuff.

464
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Okay, all right. That seems like a pretty plausible explanation. Poppy, do you have any thoughts?

465
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I can imagine that there's certainly some Ubuntu users who run benchmarks on their system, but I would imagine the typical Arch Linux user is the kind of person also who would run benchmarks.

466
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I don't know whether they've got something to prove or whether they're measuring something. But I would imagine that there is a significant number of Ubuntu users who don't measure their benchmarks.

467
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It's interesting though, right? It kind of depends on who you're coming from.

468
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
It's a self-selecting audience.

469
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Well, yes, it is. You're right. In the grand scheme, yeah. Because really though, there is value in benchmarking on Ubuntu if you're trying to see what the average Linux consumer, quote-unquote, is going to experience.

470
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But Zerolog, he wants to come in and say, you guys are all wrong. Arch isn't an advanced user's distro. So perhaps Zerolog is our theory bogus?

471
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Well, the thing is, we always make Arch out to be this advanced distro for people who have experience in Unix systems.

472
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
But really, it's not really an advanced distro as much as it is a distro for somebody who wants to learn or really knows about their system.

473
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Or wants an easy button for new software.

474
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Some people want the just works and other people want to tinker with stuff.

475
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So here's where Arch is actually, in a lot of ways, for lazy noobs. The AUR. Okay, let's not kid ourselves.

476
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,000
What the AUR is all about is getting the latest software without having to download the tar.gz, go in there, make it, make install, right?

477
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Let's be honest. That's what the AUR is about. It's about making it super easy to get the software I want because I want it right now.

478
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Now, where you need to be an advanced user to use Arch is these burnout stories we hear about.

479
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And so this is our next topic, actually.

480
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Gabriel3 wrote on the subreddit, has anyone else left Arch for another distro? And which is your after Arch distro?

481
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Because he says he took the Arch challenge and after that, he burned out and switched to OpenSUSE.

482
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And his problem has been not in building software and installing it, because that's easy under Arch.

483
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
His problem has been keeping it running.

484
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,000
That seems to be where maybe expertise and past experience play a key role in using Arch.

485
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And that does seem like the type of user who also would be benchmarking.

486
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
So I kind of agree with this theory overall.

487
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I don't think it indicates any kind of usage trend other than maybe more advanced users are using Arch more than they used to.

488
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And the fact that the two lines are kind of, I mean, I think it might suggest that's a possibility, but I don't think it means it.

489
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So here's what he wrote. I want to get into Gabriel's post, and let's kick this around.

490
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
He says, hi guys, I just want to share with you, and this wonderful community, what happened.

491
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
He said, three months ago I moved to Arch.

492
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
The beginner's guide was great, and he moved around from MATE to XFCE to GNOME, and then eventually back to MATE.

493
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
He tried out KDE and the Plasma desktop for a little while.

494
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And so then eventually, once he decided he liked Plasma, he moved over to OpenSUSE 13.1,

495
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
because in the long run he had to keep fiddling to keep his Arch running.

496
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,000
He says, I was willing to fix small issues, but it just got annoying after a while, so I switched to OpenSUSE.

497
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And this is kind of my point, is like you can have somebody go download Antigrowth or any of the other Arch derivatives,

498
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:14,000
but if Arch is hard to maintain and hard to keep running, then it probably is for more advanced people.

499
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And the thing is, and I don't know why this is, because I'm not like some sort of Jedi here,

500
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:31,000
but I have three or four Arch installations in this building that are at least six months old.

501
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Maybe some of them are a little younger than that. Some of them are over a year old now.

502
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And none of them are ever having problems.

503
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And I think part of it is just switching around the desktop.

504
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And I wondered, is this just a unique experience for me?

505
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
And I read through the comments, and I actually see people in here commenting saying,

506
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I've been using the same install for seven years.

507
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
This guy says he's been using the same install. He's even moved it between motherboards.

508
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
But then other folks are saying, yeah, I've had the same problem.

509
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So, I don't, Poby, go. What is this? What's going on here?

510
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Sorry, you were just saying you'd never have problems on Arch.

511
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Well, I never knew problems that would make me want to switch.

512
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And I have a low threshold for that kind of thing. I mean, I have...

513
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I remember an episode of this show not that long ago where you were ranting about how stuff was broken in the studio.

514
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Yeah, but I don't think that was Arch's fault. I don't think. I don't remember.

515
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Those were mostly hardware failures, as I recall.

516
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Huh?

517
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I detect some Stockholm syndrome.

518
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Well, maybe. And that's what I'm wondering.

519
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I mean, so, like, here's why I think... here's where I'm coming from.

520
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You know, I really, if something gives me much trouble, I'm more of a nuke and pave than I am a troubleshooter.

521
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Because I just have a lot of stuff to do.

522
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And I've never... my threshold is for if it's broken is, have I ever gotten to the point where I just want to format and reload the installation?

523
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And none of my Arch systems have gotten to that point.

524
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I had issues with some kernel modules that, you know, would break after a new kernel.

525
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
But then once I figured out, oh yeah, dummy, use DKMS, like, that hasn't been a problem.

526
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Like, VirtualBox has never broken since. And that was, like, you know, a year ago now.

527
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
The things I more struggle with are, like, you know, a gnome update that breaks extensions.

528
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Or the fact that ButterFS is a bastard and it's using up a ton of my drive for metadata and whatever the hell else.

529
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And those kinds of problems. But I don't really have a problem with Arch itself.

530
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I'm not trying to make this some big Arch promotion here.

531
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Well, technically you could argue that some of those are Arch problems themselves.

532
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Because you're getting bleeding edge crap, like, straight from the hose.

533
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
But I could have the same...

534
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You know, you wouldn't get that from Ubuntu from the past, 10.04 or 12.04.

535
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:54,000
You wouldn't get it from Debian stable. You wouldn't get it from Suzo, you know, 12 or whatever is their stable version.

536
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I think you're ascribing the brokenness to some upstream package.

537
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Whether it's ButterFS or whatever.

538
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
When in fact it's actually a byproduct of you running bleeding edge stuff.

539
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Exactly.

540
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,000
No, I think that's the Arch. I think that is the Arch contract in a nutshell right there.

541
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
That's it. You just nailed it.

542
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And the advantage that something like OpenSUSE has or something like that is it's not going to change very much.

543
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Or, you know, 14.04 or whatever.

544
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Unless you're on factory.

545
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Right. But I would. You see, I guess that's my core point is I'm not going to run any of those things, right?

546
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Like today, if I was going to install Fedora, I wouldn't be installing Fedora stable.

547
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I would install the latest build that they're working on right now.

548
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
If I went to OpenSUSE, I would go rolling.

549
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I would use Ubuntu 14.10. I would use Debian testing.

550
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I would not use any of those stable things. None of them.

551
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
None of them are current enough at all.

552
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,000
So since if you accept that, if that is your outlook as well, and I'm not saying it should be,

553
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
but if that is in fact is probably not a healthy one, you might want to consider it, but it's mine.

554
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And so for me, if I accept that fact, then out of all of my choices, Arch seems to be the one that's best at delivering that.

555
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
But that's great.

556
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I think it's fabulous that Arch serves a market that is out there of people who want the absolute latest bleeding edge.

557
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
But you've got to be able to cope with the brokenness when it happens.

558
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And it does happen. You're deluding yourself if you think there's no brokenness at all.

559
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
No, I agree.

560
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Because that happens with every disk, Ubuntu included.

561
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
You know what it is? I'm a bit astonished it doesn't happen a hell of a lot more, to be honest with you.

562
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Really, because like it probably happens every, you know, I don't even know, really.

563
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But like I update all the freaking time you think it would happen more often.

564
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So my point is, is perhaps what this chart does show us is there's a lot more people out there thinking the way I'm thinking over time.

565
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
It doesn't mean everybody is, but it probably means the segment of type of people that do benchmarks are kind of thinking more the way I'm thinking.

566
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
That's I think really what it shows us potentially.

567
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I find it striking how on, back in May of 2014 this year, how they start to mirror each other, Ubuntu and Arch.

568
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Yeah, right, exactly, yes.

569
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
It's really weird.

570
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
That was kind of the interesting thing.

571
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
But anyways, we'll have a link in the show, that's enough.

572
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
That's enough on that. It was a good email.

573
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
And it was something I wanted to talk about, but I didn't let myself talk about it because I was like, oh, Chris is a fanboy.

574
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
But when somebody emailed in, they gave me an excuse to bring it up.

575
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Hey, Chris.

576
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Yeah.

577
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
You know, Arch is for experienced users.

578
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:40,000
It has become a lot easier in the past few years than it has been in the past, but it is for advanced users or at least someone who isn't scared to get a little bit dirty.

579
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
We never recommended it before.

580
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,000
It was more of a try it out, dip your toe in the water, see if you like it, then determine whether or not it floats your boat.

581
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Otherwise, it might not work.

582
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Seuss might just fit his bill.

583
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Right, right.

584
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And thank goodness, too, because there's a lot of hard work going into that distribution.

585
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So, I'm glad there's people out there that it's filling a market need for.

586
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Same with all the other ones.

587
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I think we're about to get into all the drama stuff.

588
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And I think it's important to keep in mind that if that's what pulls your chain, that's totally fine.

589
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
There's really absolutely not even a little bit anything wrong with that.

590
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And we need to keep in mind, as we're about to get into all this stuff, that at the end of the day, what we are all fighting over, all this stupid hairless monkeys are fighting over is things that flip bits on either magnetic storage or solid state storage.

591
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Okay?

592
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And it's really not that big of a deal.

593
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
So, let's keep that in mind as we get into some of the drama that is going on in the Linux community.

594
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And I think just even that little distro discussion there reminds us that there's some strong feelings and all ends.

595
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
But at the end of the day, it really doesn't matter.

596
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Let's keep all of this in perspective as we get into some of this drama stuff, because I don't want this to get out of hand.

597
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:05,000
But first, before we transition to that, since I think that's going to be kind of an in-depth topic, I want to talk about DigitalOcean.

598
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Go over to DigitalOcean right now, won't you?

599
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Because it is awesome.

600
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
It is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

601
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And you could probably get started in about 55 seconds or so.

602
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I've gotten reports of 12 seconds.

603
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
33 seconds came in today.

604
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It's nuts.

605
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
The reason why is DigitalOcean's infrastructure is awesome.

606
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
They have got tier one bandwidth.

607
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
They have got SSDs throughout.

608
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
They've got some of the best hardware.

609
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Check out their Instagram feed.

610
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
They're just DigitalOcean on Instagram to see some of their data center pictures.

611
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
It's awesome.

612
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
So, you can get started in about 55 seconds, and it's going to cost you $5 a month for 512 megs of RAM.

613
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
A 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

614
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
That's an amazing value.

615
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,000
A terabyte of transfer alone for $5 is incredible, but you also get the SSD drive, and they're super fast CPUs.

616
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, and in London, a brand new one in London, actually.

617
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It's gorgeous.

618
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And their interface, it's super simple and intuitive.

619
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
The control panel is amazing.

620
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It's kind of remarkable in a sense.

621
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And they have this ability for you to take all of the functionality in the dashboard that you might want to automate.

622
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Maybe you want to write a shell script for it, or you want to snap it into your existing management infrastructure.

623
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Because you could also consider DigitalOcean as a way to offload when you have to really meet capacity, when something big is about to go on.

624
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Your project is about to launch something, a new version is about to come out, an announcement, something like that.

625
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
You can, with their straightforward API, you can integrate DigitalOcean right into your solution.

626
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Spin up the droplets as you need them.

627
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,000
And their management interface makes it so simple to take snapshots, so that way you can make sure you have a good backup before you make a major change.

628
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
They have DNS management baked right in.

629
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
One-click installations for things like GitLab, WordPress, the entire LAMP stack.

630
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And of course, DigitalOcean's all about Docker.

631
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
They're all about KVM.

632
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
They're all about Linux.

633
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And they're also letting you experiment with CoreOS, directly from the CoreOS project as well.

634
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I've got several Ubuntu LTS systems up on CoreOS, one of them running my own cloud, which I sync all of my mobile devices to now.

635
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
And it's, for me, $5 a month is a no-brainer.

636
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
But here's the best part.

637
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
We can get you a $10 discount.

638
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
So that way, you can try out DigitalOcean for two months for absolutely free.

639
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Now, we're in transition this week, so you can use the promo code unplugseptember or unpluggoctober.

640
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
That'll give you a $10 credit.

641
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Try it out.

642
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Try the $5 rig, or you can go get yourself a fancier rig.

643
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Just give it a shot and see what you think.

644
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I think you'll be pretty damn impressed.

645
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Go over to digitalocean.com and use the promo code unpluggoctober when you check out.

646
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And a huge thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

647
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
And by the way, they also have guides up for the shell shock vulnerability.

648
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And next week, I'm going to tell you more about how you can contribute to DigitalOcean's tutorial community and actually make a little money too, which is really awesome.

649
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
DigitalOcean.com.

650
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Unplugged October.

651
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And that really is something you've got to check out.

652
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I am amazed at what they can do now with DigitalOcean, especially somebody who's to deploy that stuff for clients.

653
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And that's something else you might want to consider is if you do have clients that need a website or some backend infrastructure for something they're doing or they just want to do offsite backups,

654
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
you could spin up a DigitalOcean droplet for them and even manage it for them.

655
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
At $5 a month, there's probably a little profit to be made in there.

656
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Okay.

657
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
All right.

658
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:32,000
So this week has been pretty rocky in the Linux community.

659
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And I'm not going to lie, it's pretty disappointing to watch it go down.

660
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Eric and I were sort of commiserating about this on the Tech Talk Today pre-show that we almost are kind of sick to our stomach in a sense.

661
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Right, Eric?

662
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Yeah.

663
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I'm just face palming at the entire thing.

664
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
It's sad.

665
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
It's sad to watch a community blow up like this.

666
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
So there's several things that are going on.

667
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I think the one that's created the most waves this week and the one that's really gotten a lot of response is Lenart Pottering went to Google Plus and made a post.

668
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
And I won't read the whole thing.

669
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I'll have it linked in the show notes if you want to read it, but I'll read a little bit of it.

670
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
He says, much of the open source community tries to advertise the community as one happy place to the outside.

671
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I think maybe you could contribute a little blame to the Linux Action Show and Linux Unplugged for that.

672
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
We do try to highlight the best things about the community.

673
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And sometimes, well, in this show, we go more in depth on some of the more unseen elements.

674
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
But in Linux Action Show, it's more of a showcase about what rocks.

675
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Right.

676
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
So I take some of that blame on here.

677
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:41,000
He says, where contributions are valued only by their technical quality and everybody meets at conferences for beers.

678
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I think sometimes we do perpetuate that theory, too.

679
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
But he says it's not like that.

680
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
In fact, it's quite a sick place to be in.

681
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
He says, I don't usually talk about this much.

682
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
So he says, I figure people are not very aware of this.

683
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
But the open source community is full of assholes.

684
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And I probably, you know, I should just stop right there for a second.

685
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You know, he goes on in his post to sort of say that it's kind of unbelievable.

686
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
He's all the crap that slinged him.

687
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Now, for those of you not familiar, Leonard was sort of the lead advocate behind SystemD.

688
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
He's on the development team.

689
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
He was the same for Pulse Audio and a lot of other things.

690
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
And he's had a very vocal voice in the past.

691
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
He's probably been one of the people slinging mud a little bit.

692
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And he kind of comes on here and says that it's getting out of control these days.

693
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:34,000
He even mentions that there has been an effort online to collect Bitcoin to hire a hit man to kill him.

694
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Oh, my God.

695
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Yeah.

696
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And he goes on to say that perhaps some of the blame should be lied at the feet of Linus Torvalds because Linus sets the tone for the community in his verbose sort of way.

697
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
And his direct way.

698
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
He's setting a tone for how dialogue should go to get things done.

699
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And he says he's not opposed to the use of the F word, but he's opposed to the way it's being used.

700
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
And his words are that a fish rots from the head down.

701
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And so this is a tone that's being put out there.

702
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:09,000
In fact, even though when I read Leonard's post, I did not feel like he was putting it on the feet of Linus.

703
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
But it is how now it is being picked up.

704
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
ZDNet, Matt, your buddy, Stephen Jay over there has his headline,

705
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Lenart Pottering's Linus Torvalds Rant.

706
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And Lenart did address the mailing list and whatnot.

707
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:33,000
So, Poppy, I want to open with you because you and I had a pretty good discussion about this sort of off there, quote unquote.

708
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Where should we start?

709
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
What holes am I missing in the filling in the story right now?

710
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Well, first of all, the the hitman argument seems to be a single comment from a guy on a random dude on IRC somewhere.

711
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
OK, OK.

712
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:55,000
And so you could take that as some weirdo on IRC.

713
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
We get a lot of weirdos on IRC all over the place.

714
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
The second thing I would say is Lenart is an incredibly clever guy.

715
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
He has created some amazing software.

716
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Both like System D and then before that, Pulse Audio.

717
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I love Pulse Audio.

718
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I didn't love it when it first was shipped in Ubuntu and now I do.

719
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I think it's fantastic.

720
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I just you know what?

721
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I'm using Mumble right now.

722
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I've watched YouTube videos.

723
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I use Skype and it just works.

724
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
It's fabulous.

725
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:34,000
And before that, he helped develop Avahi on Linux, the zero conf stuff.

726
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
The guy is an accomplished developer.

727
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
You know, he does good stuff for the Linux community.

728
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
He gets way more flack than I think he deserves.

729
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Yes, sometimes he could be a bit of a dick.

730
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:54,000
And in the past, when he was younger, he was somewhat abrasive and people find it difficult to work with him.

731
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
But then when I was younger, I was a bit of a dick.

732
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And I was probably someone who was somewhat abrasive and hard to work with.

733
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I think, you know, he's gone past that.

734
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:23,000
And I think, you know, given the body of work he's made and the effort that he's done to make the free software desktop a better environment for users, I think the guy should be cut a bit of slack.

735
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Okay.

736
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
All right.

737
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Now, Derek Dillon, I want to give you a chance to chime in.

738
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I just like to ask Leonard if he's listening.

739
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
You are a public figure and that comes with a price tag.

740
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And it's a public figure within the niche, but it's still a public figure for all that matters.

741
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And yes, you may have legitimacy on some of your complaints, but at that point is like not everyone that is addressing you is always a community member.

742
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:58,000
And we deal with things like that in kind of any career, as long as you happen to be in a spotlight.

743
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:04,000
He has done great things, like Papa said, and he should take everything with a grain of salt.

744
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Learn how to get away of the things that lead them to that kind of behavior.

745
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And now just a quick comment on what you said, I wouldn't take any blame on showing the positive side because the same way there's people that show the negative side, someone needs to show what is actually good about it.

746
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
We happen to have a great group in here a lot of times and we enjoy it.

747
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
So should we not talk about it?

748
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Well, you know, I'll take devil's advocate here and I'll defend Lenard in that specifically the discussions around System D in this show have gotten more hate mail in my inbox than pretty much any other topic we have ever discussed.

749
00:56:45,000 --> 00:57:00,000
And I'm surprised because it seems so over the level of anger, not always, oftentimes there's very rational emails too that are just really good emails.

750
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:07,000
But there are some that just seem so angry about it that I don't quite, it almost seems disconnected from the reality of the situation.

751
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
And that's just in my coverage of it.

752
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I'm not one of the guys that created it.

753
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
So I can only imagine the volume and amount he's getting.

754
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And so I do have some sympathy for that.

755
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
And I think I can understand a little bit how it could be wearing.

756
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And to be honest with you, it has crossed my mind if it was taking a toll on him based on the amount that I was getting long before he made this post.

757
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And it has also crossed my mind how kind of impressed I am that he's continued on under what I assume has been heavy criticism.

758
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Now this sort of confirms that.

759
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:50,000
But I think out of all the things he's done, maybe that might be something I respect him the most for, just having a slight understanding of probably what he's under.

760
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Now that said, it's something that he's also participated in.

761
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And I liked the way that Aaron Saigo said there's four paths for this kind of the way communities can go.

762
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
And he said there are many people who just simply don't interact with the community at all.

763
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
They just write code, they put out useful technology, and that's kind of it.

764
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
They interact as little as possible.

765
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Some communities have adopted the stance that the most important thing is the creation of technology for everyone to be nice to each other at all times or else.

766
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
That's another path.

767
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
It's usually motivated by the right intentions.

768
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
But it can sort of steal the focus away.

769
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Everybody has to be nice. Everybody be nice. Everybody be nice.

770
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
And then there's the technology co-creation path.

771
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
And this is the one that resonated with me.

772
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,000
He says there is a healthy path where people focus on technology creation first and foremost.

773
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And the one would do well as to get as many free software communities on.

774
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,000
In these kinds of environments, social interactions are something that happens as a happy byproduct of making great technology together.

775
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Now, I want to take that sentence and I want to read it to you again, but I want to use different words.

776
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Instead of technology, let's use the word podcasts.

777
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Okay, so he says here, this is a healthy path where people can focus on the podcasts first and foremost, where the content matters.

778
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:11,000
In these kinds of environments, social interactions are something that happens as a happy byproduct of making a great show together.

779
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And that is sort of where the Jupiter Broadcasting Community comes from.

780
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
A lot of us have become friends as a result of working on the content.

781
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
The content comes first. The show comes first.

782
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:33,000
And within that paradigm, if I yell at Eric, or I yell at Q5, or they yell at me, it's because we want to make a better show together.

783
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
It's not because it's an ego thing. It's not our personalities combating.

784
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
It's because we both, first and foremost, care more about the show.

785
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,000
And so there's a mutual respect that is shared between us that we're really just trying to make the product better.

786
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:54,000
And sometimes that requires talking a little tough because when it's a creative thing, just like software, it can very much be a creative process.

787
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
There's a lot of passion involved. That's the nature of it.

788
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And unfortunately, you can't have it both ways.

789
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:09,000
If you want to make something great, you want to make something better than everybody else is making, then it takes that kind of personal commitment where you're really all in.

790
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
And when you're all in on something like that, you go to the mat for it and you fight for it.

791
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And sometimes that causes controversy.

792
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:27,000
But if the end product is the goal at the end of the day, then there's sort of, I wish I had a better term, but an adult detached perspective you can take

793
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:37,000
where you can have a robust, sometimes hard conversation, and then 10-15 minutes, everything's okay, and now you're back to working on the product again.

794
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
And that, I think, is bared out in our community right here.

795
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I kind of 50% agree with you because I spent the weekend when I was at a conference, I spent probably about 45 minutes arguing with Stuart Langridge about something.

796
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Admittedly, I was like 10 pints under, and so was he.

797
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
That's the best time, apparently.

798
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:15,000
But at the end of it, we have a conversation and it's robust, but I think there's a difference between that and then someone barking orders at someone.

799
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I'm going to point this at you directly, Chris.

800
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:38,000
There's been a couple of occasions on Mumble where you've been quite abrasive to people here as a result of you feeling like, the perception is that you're feeling that the input is not warranted, not wanted.

801
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And what you've just explained is that the creative process is king, that the content is king, that actually what matters is what you get out at the end.

802
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Hang the fact that you're kicking people along the way, and I don't think that's the right way to do it.

803
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I do see what you're saying there, and I wouldn't be one of those things where the conversation ends completely.

804
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
They could continue to advocate their case and my mind could be changed, that happens all the time.

805
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:18,000
But I think sometimes, specifically for content creation, maybe not software creation, I don't know, I don't have as much experience there,

806
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:27,000
but there eventually has to be somebody who says, this is how we're doing it, and we're doing it this way because I know the best about this, because this is my area.

807
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:35,000
And this is kind of why sometimes I see how Linus operates and I think, yes, he is setting a tone that is not healthy.

808
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
At the same time, what the hell is he going to do?

809
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:43,000
This is the reality of the environment he's in and these are the people that he needs to motivate.

810
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:50,000
And I see that as well with Mark Shuttleworth, who has his opinions on the direction of Ubuntu.

811
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:57,000
And there are people who are contributing their spare time in the same way there are people contributing their spare time to help you out with Jupiter.

812
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
And there are people who are helping Lenna out with System D or whatever.

813
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:08,000
There's always this pool of people who are sometimes on a bit of a knife edge.

814
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,000
You push them too far, you're going to push them over and they're going to stop contributing and they're going to walk away.

815
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:21,000
And hold that thought, because that's our next, that's sort of where we're going to get to in the gaming on Linux stuff.

816
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
So I think you're going in the right direction, but hold on, you're going there too soon.

817
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Eric, I want to give you a chance, just sort of somebody who's been in the process where we've been working things out to kind of chime in.

818
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
And you can also throw me under the bus if you want.

819
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Well, what I wanted to talk about was how much you and I and you and Q5 and Q5 and me and Rikai and whatnot, everybody who's a part of the crew has had a lot of disagreements with each other about a lot of different things.

820
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
It shows up all the time.

821
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,000
At the end of the day, we are going towards a common goal and it has to produce good content.

822
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
And I think we are constantly getting there.

823
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Do you think though that, see this is where I'm trying to get to, I guess at the end of the day, the fundamental question is, is there a place for where you just sometimes have to come in and say, no, we're doing it this way.

824
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Everybody F off.

825
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Well, yeah, and that's where you come in because you're the guy in charge of the show.

826
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:22,000
So when you do that, we have, it's basically, it's your baby.

827
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
We're just here to help you take care of it.

828
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Well, okay.

829
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
So, okay, we'll go back to that.

830
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
First, I want to give Heaven's a chance to go and then we'll go to Daredevil.

831
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
So go ahead, Heaven's Revenge.

832
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Well, in our community, there is, there tends to be a lot of extremist opinions.

833
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:41,000
One that we don't usually knock on too much because we love him so much is RMS.

834
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
He is very extremist, but we love his opinion.

835
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
You know, I was going to point that out.

836
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Is he also, I mean, we're kind of dogging on Linus here, but let's be honest, RMS is system things, right?

837
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And you know, they're needed in a way, but I like to compare it like this.

838
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
We have captains in our community.

839
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
They are the figureheads or the people that kind of give us direction.

840
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
There's one important word that will, that explains this.

841
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
It's called the mutiny.

842
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:16,000
When people don't like the direction of the captain, like you, Chris, if you are the captain of the Jupiter Broadcasting Network, there's the captain of certain projects.

843
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:28,000
When people don't like the way the direction is going, they will mutiny and they will be very violent and try to do everything they can to try and make that problem not a problem within their minds.

844
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
And this, it gets visceral.

845
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Whoa.

846
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Oh man.

847
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

848
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Are you thinking about the twit stuff that's going on right now?

849
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Is that kind of what you're referring to?

850
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
No.

851
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Okay.

852
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
So I'll get to that in a second.

853
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Daredevil.

854
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
That's a big, good point.

855
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Okay, so I'm going to mention this right now is this is an interesting thing about community.

856
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
And this is something that businesses are not really equipped well to understand and handle.

857
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,000
And I won't go, I don't want to make this a J.B. twit thing, but twits having major problems with their community right now.

858
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And so much so that their community has organized a blog with several contributors and a separate chat room.

859
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:11,000
And they are really organizing to go after twit in a very organized troll fashion.

860
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And it's really spinning out of control.

861
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:19,000
And I'm kind of amazed at the amount of energy that is being spent to go after something that these people once cherished.

862
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
And it's exactly to a T what you just said, Heaven.

863
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
So we're watching this right now happen to the twit network.

864
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
And I like at one time, you know, I feel bad for them.

865
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:36,000
But I also see how they are not managing the situation and not respecting the community and sort of adding fuel to this fire.

866
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
And so it's a really interesting thing to have sort of spin out of control.

867
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Daredevilin, I want to give you a chance to chime in.

868
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Recently there was an article that actually was posted on Reddit about MySQL trademark issues.

869
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:57,000
And one of the actually points that was very well made is that there are open source products and there are open source projects.

870
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
And there are differences on how they are handled.

871
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:17,000
So I think Lenard in this situation is kind of a hybrid of it because he's working for Red Hat, which definitely creates things like System D, which are more of an open source product coming out of Red Hat.

872
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Sure.

873
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:33,000
And that itself just makes the community more impulsive, like Heaven was pointing out, towards trying to make it a project so they are sure if it's going to affect their distribution, they will have a say on it.

874
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And there is going to be some consensus.

875
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
So it becomes a project rather than a product.

876
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And I think that is really just something that you cannot avoid if you're in a position like Lenard is.

877
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
He has made great things and that's called attention.

878
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
I don't think particularly that's a bad thing.

879
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:59,000
So is your basic argument that if you want to be successful on the internet, you have to have a super thick skin and prepare to have just the worst stuff ever said about you and to you?

880
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
To a degree, yes.

881
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I mean, society has always been like this.

882
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I can accept that as an answer.

883
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I mean, I don't think you're necessarily wrong, but I want to transition to something that's a little more recent to kind of show you, we're kind of talking about this in the abstract.

884
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I want to kind of narrow our focus a little bit and talk about what's going on with a couple of friends of this show, the Linux game cast and gamingonlinux.com, both of whom I just gave plugs to in this Sunday's Linux action show, thinking kumbaya, everybody loves each other.

885
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:48,000
And the reason why I don't, you know, we don't need to get into the specifics of the drama, but what I want to get to is I'm building a case to why this stuff actually matters and how it actually impacts not just Linux, but adoption of Linux and the way the outside community perceives us.

886
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:59,000
And I think this current example that we have today clearly lays it all out there and it shows us the real world cost of this because right now we're talking about in sort of the abstract and for Lenard and et cetera, et cetera.

887
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
So that's kind of where I want to take this.

888
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
But before we get to that, as you might expect, we have one more sponsor to get to.

889
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
And it's one that I think you definitely want going to want to check out.

890
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:18,000
And they have a brand new website to Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash to unplug to get a 33 percent discount on tuition.

891
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Linux Academy has a brand new website and Matt, this website is looking slick.

892
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:30,000
They've really done a great job and they're adding more courses to it's not just that it's like it's amazing how much how hard these guys are working these days.

893
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,000
And that's it's really awesome because it's Linux enthusiasts that came together with designers and educators.

894
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,000
And it's really that symbiotic relationship that's paying off now and you can go check it out.

895
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
So what is Linux Academy?

896
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Check this out.

897
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Think about a repository of knowledge for managing anything you might want to know from Linux to AWS, OpenStack or if you want to get into DevOps, they've got courses on all of it.

898
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Step by step video courses, downloadable comprehensive study guides for you to read offline.

899
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
And as your courseware requires it, it comes with its own server.

900
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
They spin up a server on demand.

901
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
You can choose from seven plus Linux distributions.

902
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Then they automatically adjust the courseware so it matches that Linux distribution.

903
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:19,000
And I cannot underscore this new feature enough because this is oh man, if I if I was kind of maybe wanting to sort of step out or if I was curious about what other technologies I could get into

904
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:29,000
or if I just had gotten thrown into a major project and I needed to know how to deploy GitLab or manage OpenStack or integrate AWS, this would be my salvation.

905
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
They have a new system called Learning Plans.

906
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Learning Plans allow the user to select your daily availability.

907
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Based on your availability, the study plan is automatically generating and it gives you lessons and quizzes and labs.

908
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
It'll send you reminders when those are due.

909
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
You can retest yourself and you can continually sort of adjust based on your availability.

910
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,000
You know, go take some Chef Fundamentals, Puppet, CentOS 7, Ubuntu, OpenStack.

911
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:02,000
You can do a scenario based lab too where you actually implement something on AWS or deploy a server and get it up and running.

912
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
They have so many cool things up and coming too.

913
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
And once you become a Linux Academy subscriber, you just get all the stuff.

914
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:13,000
You can just keep going, use all just keep learning, keep trying out new things and try out the new courseware.

915
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
They're also constantly integrating live streams and Q&As with the educators.

916
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Head over to linuxacademy.com slash dumpbug, get the 33% discount.

917
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Go learn about the Heartbleed bug.

918
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
They've got a whole course up about that right now.

919
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Backing up with R-Sync, seriously something you might want to consider.

920
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Setting up a remote GUI desktop, they've got courses on that.

921
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Working with NGINX, Nagios, oh my gosh.

922
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Nagios is such an awesome tool if you're in an enterprise or even a small business and you're not doing monitoring, go take the Nagios course.

923
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
It's worth it right there.

924
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Linuxacademy.com slash unplug and a huge thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

925
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Okay, so to bring the drama home and talk about what's going on now.

926
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
We've had Liam on the show.

927
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
The gaming on Linux, he's Liam, right? That's his name?

928
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
That's right, that's right.

929
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Yeah, he's been on the show before and gave him a plug on Sunday.

930
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Today, this morning, he says, I'm moving on from gaming on Linux.

931
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I'm quitting.

932
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I'm no longer going to write here again.

933
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And he lays the blame square on another podcaster.

934
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
And I did some digging into this and it appears there's been some barbs back and forth.

935
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Essentially, what it boiled down to is just for those of you who care.

936
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:31,000
A game developer contacted LGC, Linux Gamecast Weekly, said, hey, would you like to review our stuff?

937
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Who knows what happened?

938
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Maybe they gave him a bad review, whatever.

939
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:45,000
You know, a lot of times these developers are essentially expecting the blogger or the podcaster to be so excited that they're being contacted by the developer and that they got free keys.

940
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
They almost expect a good review.

941
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:54,000
And very likely, knowing the LGC guys, if they didn't like the game, they were pretty honest about it.

942
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Yeah, usually they are.

943
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,000
And what I gather is the developer wasn't super happy about that.

944
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:08,000
And so Liam tweeted at him or something like that and said, well, you know, if you're not happy with your review, maybe you should consider reaching out to other media outlets.

945
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
The LGC crew are kind of known for being rough or something like to that extent, right?

946
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Which then started a series of back and forths and name calling and things like that, which eventually led to Liam posting a resignation.

947
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I think this is something that's happened before.

948
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Drama, drama, drama.

949
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Here is the practical outcome that is likely going to affect Linux.

950
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
We have two problems now.

951
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Number one, gaming on Linux will continue on.

952
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
It's community funded.

953
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
They're funded until December, according to comments from him.

954
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
But likely less content, right?

955
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Because he was the chief editor, the number one contributor.

956
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Here's why that matters.

957
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:58,000
If you're a game shop and you're releasing your game for Linux, it is really hard to figure out who the hell you're supposed to talk to, to generate some buzz, to get some reviews, to inform the community that your game's there.

958
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Because there's a lot of games that come out that nobody even knows about.

959
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,000
And so what gamingonlinux.com became was sort of that first stop.

960
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Because it's something that these development shops who have been living in the Windows or console ecosystem their entire existence can wrap their brain around.

961
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
They understand what the site's about.

962
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
It's in the name.

963
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
They see they have lots of reviews.

964
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,000
They have decent traffic, decent enough, whatever it is, I have no idea.

965
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And they can grok it.

966
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
And that is sort of to them, it's their on-ramp.

967
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:36,000
There's other outlets, but I got to tell you, from my own personal experience dealing with these people, they have no clue what the hell they're doing.

968
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
They have no clue how to do this.

969
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
They are completely at a loss.

970
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
They are desperate to have a way to do this.

971
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Because this is really established in all the commercial gaming platforms.

972
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:55,000
They, I get emails constantly with keys where they're just asking us to review the game because they're desperate to get attention.

973
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
They don't have any idea how to do it.

974
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:04,000
And the problem is, is now one of the obvious and clear paths for them to do that is going to decline.

975
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
And all of us will suffer to some small degree because of it.

976
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:15,000
The result is because of bickering between two people who are essentially fighting over the same tiny market share,

977
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,000
even though really they are sort of co-complementary because one's a blog and one's a podcast.

978
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:26,000
But because, you know, they had to measure each other's dicks constantly, now everyone suffers.

979
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Instead of treating each other like human beings, instead of just staying on their own respective lawns and focusing on their content,

980
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:39,000
they had to focus on the ego and the argument and the pride of it all.

981
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:47,000
And now, one of the key resources for developers looking to announce their game for Linux users could decline because of it.

982
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
It's kind of disappointing.

983
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:57,000
So this stupid drama that none of us can stand, that none of us want to really pay attention to, does actually have some kind of impact.

984
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Who knows how bad, but it has some.

985
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
It's kind of disappointing.

986
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:11,000
And, you know, if you guys want to read into it, you can read the links in the show notes.

987
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I don't really feel like getting into the nitty details.

988
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
But all right, let's start taking mumble room comments.

989
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Go ahead, Daredevil, and I'll open it to you first.

990
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
So the first tip is go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact.

991
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Ask Chris to review the game.

992
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
The second tip is join the IRC.

993
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
It's also available on the site.

994
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
You can watch it there.

995
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,000
And there's a lot of people that will do the work either freely or even if you pay them the beer,

996
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
they will gladly help you get in the process then.

997
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
There you go.

998
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Okay, there you go.

999
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Good tip.

1000
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Great tip.

1001
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Matt, I think you said it best in the subreddit.

1002
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Come on now.

1003
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
What is the matter with us, Matt?

1004
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I mean, this seems like we need a little common sense.

1005
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Well, so I mean, regardless of who peed and who's Cheerios,

1006
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
because at the end of the day, it really doesn't make any difference.

1007
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:10,000
You know, as far as like how the reactionary stuff's gone back and forth and whatnot, you know,

1008
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
both parties involved need to just kind of take a step back and be like, honestly, this isn't really worth it.

1009
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Now, as far as him wanting to leave the work he's been doing, you know,

1010
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I think that's concerning because I think he's done some good work and I think that's unfortunate.

1011
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:30,000
And I also would point out then to anyone that produces content, you better have a thick skin.

1012
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
You know, if disagreements come up, you really ought to.

1013
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:37,000
And I posted some examples of some public rippings that I've gotten in that subreddit.

1014
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
One of them was very public.

1015
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
And, you know, and you learn from those experiences.

1016
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
And so in this particular case, regardless of who was right or wrong, you know,

1017
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
let this be a lesson to everyone that, you know, words certainly matter,

1018
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
but at the same time, you can't control other people's behavior.

1019
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
You just can't. You have to really decide on how you're going to react to it.

1020
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
It is, at the end of the day, it is your choice on how you process it and how it affects you.

1021
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Because it really is just some other hairless monkey at the other end of that wire that's saying what they think.

1022
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,000
And it really doesn't matter. And you can make it matter. You can choose to make it matter.

1023
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:15,000
But I think, I don't know, I guess what I worry about is that I don't want to get lumped in with this drama.

1024
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I don't want it to come across the whole community looks like that.

1025
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Poppy, what are your thoughts on that?

1026
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I agree. I play games and I use Linux.

1027
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
So I'm a Linux gamer, you would think.

1028
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:37,000
But I think, you know, the short answer is I think Liam overreacts.

1029
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
And I think the other guys are dicks, in short.

1030
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
And I think probably they best avoid each other.

1031
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:52,000
It feels very similar to playground shenanigans where, oh, he said this and she said that.

1032
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
And it's just, you know, separate them out.

1033
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
So how do we actually practically do that, though?

1034
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Why would we? It's nothing to do with us. It's one dick online calling someone else.

1035
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
But if it has ramifications for the entire community.

1036
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
If you let it, yeah.

1037
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:18,000
OK, one other thing, Lenore, if you remember when you were a dick and we put up with you, then just put up with someone new.

1038
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Yeah, I guess that's the thing.

1039
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I'm not a fan of the grow a thick skin argument.

1040
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:31,000
I think, yes, you need to be able to avoid whatever mechanism you need to use.

1041
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
You need to avoid abuse.

1042
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Now, whether that means blocking people on Twitter, putting people in a kill file or whatever that means.

1043
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Yes, do that.

1044
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:50,000
But equally, you should be able to do your job, whatever that job is, whether it's making a video podcast or writing articles about gaming online.

1045
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:56,000
You should be able to do that without fear that some lunatic on the Internet is going to start giving you abuse.

1046
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:01,000
And you shouldn't let them give you abuse. You should do whatever you need to do to block that.

1047
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
And I will go ahead.

1048
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
I was going to say in the past, I've had bodily harm threats before.

1049
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
You know, like I said, there's a certain tier of things that you have to take it.

1050
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
The first attempt, obviously, to try and work it out.

1051
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:18,000
If it can be worked out, which I'm in the process of actually working it out with the individual, you know, is involved in this.

1052
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
That's great. You know, that's awesome.

1053
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Now, going forward, if someone is just making it their mission in life to just troll you, essentially, I mean, even to the point of it being abusive.

1054
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:32,000
At that point, you do need to take a step to do everything you can to block them out.

1055
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
But it's about it's not about right and wrong. It's about effective behavior.

1056
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
If you're cornered in a schoolyard and this kid's going to kick your butt, you got a couple choices.

1057
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
One, you can try and beeline and hope he doesn't tackle you.

1058
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Or you can pop him in the nose and then go on with your life.

1059
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I choose the latter. And so that doesn't mean it's right for everybody.

1060
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
And it certainly doesn't mean that, you know, responding in kind is the right approach.

1061
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
I think that's not the message to be taken there.

1062
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:00,000
But it's a matter of what is the most effective behavior that's going to get you a result to where you can resolve this, whatever that may be.

1063
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Right. It's unique. Yeah. Yeah.

1064
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Yeah, I think it's unique.

1065
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:08,000
In this particular instance, someone, whoever it may be, needs to just stop and walk away.

1066
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
You can't have an argument without two people.

1067
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I have a couple of closing thoughts.

1068
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,000
But one thing that I wanted to ask Wimpy about is, I'm worried about Wimpy things about this.

1069
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Because I was in the, like I mentioned earlier, the Linux underscore gaming subreddit.

1070
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
And I saw a post in there from a Windows user.

1071
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
And he said, you know, I was just thinking about switching over to Linux.

1072
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
But I was just browsing the various subreddits.

1073
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I'm seeing a lot of drama. Am I in for a bad ride when I switch over?

1074
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:40,000
And Wimpy, do you think that this is something that we need to worry about as a public perception of all this infighting?

1075
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Yeah, I think we, in quotes, look silly to the tech world at large.

1076
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:58,000
And unfortunately, it isn't the luminaries in the open source community that are making us look silly.

1077
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:05,000
It's the vocal majority who are slinging the mud and making the noise.

1078
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Who are discrediting Linux as a platform.

1079
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:16,000
And they're saving Apple and Microsoft a job because they don't need to discredit us.

1080
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Because we're doing it to ourselves.

1081
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
It's a good thing they need the technology we make so damn badly.

1082
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,000
And anyone that tells me a Mac person doesn't, I got a Maclope article I'll have you read sometime.

1083
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Because I will tell you Mac people are quite verbal.

1084
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Not all of us are like this.

1085
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
No, not all of us.

1086
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,000
And I had it coming in that instance. But just pointing out, they're very vocal.

1087
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Well, I kind of want to wrap on this closing thought here.

1088
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
And then we'll put this topic to bed, hopefully.

1089
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I think one of the things that keeps coming up in all of these threads.

1090
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I've seen it now in essentially every comment thread about this and in some of these blog posts.

1091
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
It's the Linus angle.

1092
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
You know, let's blame Linus.

1093
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Boy that is, yeah, I can see the pretty valid argument there.

1094
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,000
And I don't want to discredit some pretty smart people on our subreddit that are arguing that case.

1095
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I think there is some merit to that.

1096
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:20,000
But, you know, I was recently reminded that you can have the worst influence growing up or whatever it is.

1097
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
You know, in your work environment, in your community.

1098
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:29,000
At the end of that though, you are the one making the decision.

1099
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Not Linus.

1100
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
It's not Linus that's making you use the F word and yell at somebody.

1101
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Just because you're choosing to excuse your behavior because you saw him do it, doesn't mean it's his fault.

1102
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
It's your fault.

1103
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And when you are going on the internet and you're yelling at people for the bits they are flipping on some spinning magnetic platter,

1104
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
remember it's your choice to do it.

1105
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Not Linus's choice.

1106
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Not Lenart's choice.

1107
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
It's you.

1108
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
And it really is something you need to consider.

1109
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:03,000
And blaming Linus while cathartic and also a great scapegoat at the end of the day is crap.

1110
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
It's you.

1111
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
So you have to stop it.

1112
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
It's each one of us.

1113
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
It's every one of us.

1114
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
We all have to be cognizant of it.

1115
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
And at the same time, we need to grow up a little bit.

1116
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Maybe stop arguing on the internet.

1117
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
And maybe have a little bit of a thicker skin.

1118
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
And it's really kind of a balanced approach to all of those things.

1119
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
It's not one or the other.

1120
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:29,000
It's all of those things balanced together that make interacting with other hairless monkeys through a wire manageable.

1121
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,000
And, you know, I go back to this is why we need to get together in meat space more often.

1122
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
It changes the dynamic.

1123
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
It changes everything.

1124
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
It changes the way we treat each other.

1125
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
It deepens the connection.

1126
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Well, especially if the guy you're messing with turns out to be 6'4 and 200-some pounds, you know,

1127
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
and you're just a little dude sitting in front of a keyboard.

1128
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
All of a sudden you're not so tough.

1129
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
You know, and that changes the equation pretty quickly.

1130
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Yeah, yeah.

1131
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,000
And I want to also just a quick plug before we get out of here.

1132
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,000
This is the last week to take a simple System D survey that Producer Q5 has put together.

1133
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
And he says he'll be sharing the results in about a week.

1134
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
So you can go to systemdsurvey.com.

1135
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,000
And we're just trying to, or he, he's just trying to get a little background info about either one.

1136
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Either side of the fence.

1137
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
It doesn't matter.

1138
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
It's just kind of a general survey.

1139
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Systemdsurvey.com.

1140
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
If you're a user or a hater, you can go take the survey.

1141
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Just kind of curious to see where the results land, and I'm sure we'll talk about them in next week's Unplugged.

1142
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
So, Matt, I think that's everything we have.

1143
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
So we just kind of have like a couple essentials to let people know about.

1144
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Number one, you might have noticed this is kind of a community-driven show.

1145
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
We're pretty proud of that.

1146
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
And we'd like you to be involved with it.

1147
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
You can go over to jblive.tv.

1148
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
We do it on a Tuesday at 2 p.m. Pacific.

1149
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:38,000
If you don't know what that is in your time, because I know, I know it's crazy.

1150
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Just go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1151
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
The robots will convert it for you.

1152
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
But more importantly, I'd like to ask you to engage.

1153
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Specifically, in the subreddit, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1154
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
We'll have a link in there for this episode where you can give us feedback.

1155
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
I'd like to hear your thoughts on all of this.

1156
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:58,000
This is definitely one of those episodes where everybody should try to treat each other a little bit better in that thread.

1157
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
And let's just have a really good conversation.

1158
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:08,000
And, you know, the Linux Action Show subreddit, while it can get heated, is, as far as, you know, online communities goes, is really one of the greatest.

1159
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
It is filled with some of the smartest people that really have great conversations.

1160
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
And, yeah, sometimes it gets rough.

1161
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
And, hey, I've been at the end of that gun before.

1162
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
But it really is a great community.

1163
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
linuxactionshow.reddit.com and jblive.tv for the live show.

1164
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:29,000
And, really, last but not least, go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact and choose Linux Unplugged from the dropdown.

1165
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Send us your feedback.

1166
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
It's a big part of this show.

1167
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
If you can't be in the Mamba Room or you don't use Reddit, that's still a great way to contribute.

1168
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Just go over there, jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact.

1169
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
All right, Matt.

1170
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Well, have a great week.

1171
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

1172
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
All right, you too.

1173
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I'll see you then.

1174
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
All right, everyone.

1175
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Well, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1176
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Head over to jupiterbroadcasting.com.

01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Click on episode 61 to get all of the links for stuff we talked about.

1178
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:59,000
And maybe while you're there, you could grab an RSS feed and get this show automatically every single stinking week.

1179
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
You don't even have to think about it.

1180
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Put in your favorite podcast catcher.

1181
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Why not?

1182
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
All right, everyone.

1183
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1184
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
See you right back here next week.

1185
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I'll see you next week.

1186
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:42,000
All right.

1187
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
All right.

1188
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Little post-show time.

1189
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Okay.

1190
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
So I had, I don't know.

1191
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I can't remember.

1192
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Mumbler, do you remember what the hell I wanted to talk about in the post-show?

1193
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
I don't even recall now.

1194
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I think it was something to do with you getting the snip, wasn't it?

1195
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
No, we talked about that.

1196
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Should we put that in here?

1197
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
I don't know if we want to put that in the release version.

1198
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
I don't think we do.

1199
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,000
No, it was something else, but now I've totally forgotten what it was.

1200
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Dang it.

1201
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
I had something.

1202
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Yeah, go ahead.

1203
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
The community.

1204
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Italy court actually ruled in favor of consumers in the case of Microsoft Windows X.

1205
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:28,000
So coming pre-installed, and it's now mandatory that computer sellers in Italy to sell without

1206
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:34,000
the user does not want to refund them the Windows license price.

1207
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,000
So do you suppose, okay, let's go to JBtitles.com.

1208
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
By the way, great news.

1209
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
That's great.

1210
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I just got to get titles.

1211
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
JBtitles.com.

1212
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Right now, Linux soap opera is way, way, way, way up there, but I'm kind of leaning towards

1213
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Don't Feed the Trolls, even though it's number third in the list, but Don't Feed the Trolls

1214
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
seems like the actual message.

1215
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Yeah, it really does.

1216
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Hey, Chris.

1217
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Yeah.

1218
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,000
At some point in time, do you think we could have like the most pop tart or rainbow shitting

1219
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:08,000
tart cat eating positive show over instead of all this negative kill each other stabbing

1220
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
each other.

1221
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
That's what it was.

1222
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
That's what it was.

1223
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
That's what it was.

1224
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
I know.

1225
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Maybe Chris is not honest.

1226
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Yeah.

1227
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I know.

1228
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
No, come on.

1229
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I'm not the one making the drama.

1230
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Come on.

1231
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
It's not mine.

1232
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I know, but there's these little specific things that rape people up the ass so hard

1233
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
and it fucks up the rest of our view.

1234
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
We need that beauty that we see.

1235
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
It's like a jewel.

1236
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Oh, you're being rude to yourself.

1237
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
No.

1238
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Okay.

1239
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
You reminded me of my post-show topic though.

1240
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
All right.

1241
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Everybody go to JBtitles.com and vote.

1242
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,200
You still have a chance to bang suggest to, but okay, here's what it was.

1243
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:44,480
This is totally hippy dippy, but give it some serious consideration.

1244
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:45,480
Okay.

1245
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:50,200
What if, and the only reason I mentioned this is because I hate using this card because

1246
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:53,680
it sounds like such a douche bag thing to say, but I've honestly been doing this for

1247
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:59,440
a while and I've kind of noticed a trend and the trend is when the media is really hyping

1248
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:03,320
something scary, like, oh, I don't know, ISIS and Ebola.

1249
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:08,960
It feels like everybody is really stressed the hell out and it comes out and like people

1250
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,720
are taking things way more seriously than they should.

1251
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:15,320
Maybe they hyper-focus on something to distract them from the boogeyman that's being constantly

1252
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:19,480
fear porn pushed down their mouth hole and their ear holes and in their face and that

1253
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:24,160
maybe this constant Ebola outbreak, ISIS taking over the East, going to war, going

1254
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:28,820
back into Iraq, constant boom, boom, boom slamming us over the head with fear is causing

1255
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:32,920
us to kind of treat each other kind of like shit because we're all stressed out in the

1256
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:33,920
background.

1257
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:34,920
It's like a background anxiety.

1258
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:36,000
Maybe we're not even fully realizing it.

1259
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,640
It's like this background thing that's stressing us out because it's this bad thing and you

1260
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:40,860
could be on either side, right?

1261
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:44,960
You could actually be buying all of this ISIS propaganda and think that they're the boogeyman

1262
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:49,260
or you could be really mad at your government for going back into Iraq for the fourth time

1263
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:50,600
and be really stressed out about that.

1264
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:53,920
Like you could be on either end of the political spectrum and it could still be bothering the

1265
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:57,960
hell out of you, but maybe you're internalizing it and focusing down on the technology to

1266
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,400
distract yourself from it.

1267
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,800
And so you're taking all of these technology matters really super seriously, even though

1268
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,820
really at the end of the day, you're trying to avoid the actual really scary thing that's

1269
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:08,320
going on in the real world.

1270
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:09,320
That's a nice idea.

1271
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:16,040
I'd counter that with, I've just spent the weekend with 300 random people who I've mostly

1272
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:23,100
never met before and they were all super positive and really friendly and the world's troubles

1273
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:25,480
didn't crop up in conversation.

1274
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:28,920
But that's like that happens when you get together as a group.

1275
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,240
It becomes different.

1276
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:33,680
But then maybe when you're back at your house, and again, and the thing about the internet

1277
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:35,160
is it doesn't take all of us.

1278
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:40,080
It just takes a few of us in the right spot to be bothered by it to cause a big dustup.

1279
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,520
And I'm not even saying it's like it's pushing us.

1280
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:46,760
It's just sort of like this background agitation that just sort of makes us a little more on

1281
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:47,760
edge normally.

1282
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:52,360
A lot of people don't even remember that people behind the keyboard are people too.

1283
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:54,240
I remember someone here said this before.

1284
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:57,440
It might've been poppy or wimpy, but they're humans too.

1285
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:01,800
And they've got, you know, they care sometimes about what you have to say.

1286
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:06,400
That's my biggest pet peeve is that people don't understand at the end of the day, we're

1287
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:12,320
all people behind that monitor, behind the keyboard, and you have to, even some people

1288
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:15,200
have a problem where they can't associate that.

1289
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:16,200
And it's a thing.

1290
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:19,040
And we all put our pants on one leg at a time.

1291
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,040
Right?

1292
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,040
Exactly.

1293
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,040
Everybody poops.

1294
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:26,800
Everybody's happy at like all these conferences and, you know, beers, handshaking, pats on

1295
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:27,800
the back.

1296
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:30,280
But when we get behind the keyboard, it's shank or be shanked.

1297
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:31,280
We're assholes.

1298
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,280
Always.

1299
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,280
Yeah.

1300
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:36,560
First time I met Leonard Pottering was at an Ubuntu developer summit when we invited

1301
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:37,560
him along.

1302
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:38,560
I think it was in Prague.

1303
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:43,520
And I remember sitting around having beer with him and everything was cool.

1304
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:46,480
It was all fine.

1305
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:52,640
But you know, behind a keyboard, on both sides of the fence, everyone gets a little bit more

1306
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:53,640
grumpy.

1307
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:54,640
Yeah.

1308
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:55,640
Yep.

1309
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:59,160
And I think, you know, when Leonard said we all like to talk like it's roses and sunshine,

1310
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:02,300
what we like to talk about is not something that's manufactured.

1311
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:03,300
It's real.

1312
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:05,900
But there's just, like everything, a gray area.

1313
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:10,080
And we like to talk about the happy spectrum more than we talk about the bad spectrum.

1314
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:13,520
And so I don't know, maybe this show has gotten negative recently.

1315
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:17,520
But at the same time, it feels like there is a little self-analysis that needs to be

1316
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,720
done here to shore up a few things.

1317
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:23,440
And I don't know if we're helping the dialogue at all, but it's making me feel better.

1318
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:26,280
Well, a lot of people hate change too.

1319
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:30,480
And especially since Leonard is causing a whole lot of change in our ecosystem, a lot

1320
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,600
of hate is going to be poured onto the guy.

1321
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:38,040
So first of all, I completely agree with heavens that we need a bit more positivity in the

1322
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:39,040
show.

1323
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,720
I think that that's a good idea.

1324
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:46,200
On that point about Leonard is causing change, no, Leonard isn't causing change.

1325
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,720
We need to separate the man from the software here.

1326
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,480
Leonard is a software developer.

1327
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:55,080
It's system D that is holding change in the Linux community.

1328
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:59,280
And that's what people should actually be angry about if that's how they feel about

1329
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:00,280
it.

1330
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:02,640
It's system D that they should be debating and challenging.

1331
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:07,440
It is not hurling mud and insults and abuse at one of the developers.

1332
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,440
Okay.

1333
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:13,920
Well, all I would say is that when one of the developers goes and happens to treat other

1334
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:18,800
people's poorly, even if it isn't really his fault because he's responding poorly after

1335
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:23,920
he's been treated badly by someone else, that doesn't do anything but continue the awful

1336
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:24,920
cycle.

1337
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:28,880
Yeah, your point's well taken.

1338
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:34,040
I kind of wanted to go back to the positivity thing because I think it's good to get your

1339
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,040
guys' input on this.

1340
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,720
So I agree.

1341
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:44,920
And you know, really what it is, is the thing is, is what really works best for a discussion

1342
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:48,960
show like this is topics that people can have an opinion on.

1343
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:51,160
And sometimes that's some of the negative stuff, right?

1344
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:55,560
Because if it's just specs and features, there's not really a lot of space in there for you

1345
01:34:55,560 --> 01:35:00,040
guys to chime in with your opinions and for us to sort stuff out.

1346
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:05,100
So some of your shows benefit from, you know, I'm not trying to pull the curtain away and

1347
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:10,160
show the Wizard of Oz, but some of your bookshows benefit from you being a grumpy old bastard

1348
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:13,080
and the rest of us coming in here and, you know.

1349
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:14,080
I'm not that grumpy.

1350
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,080
I really am not a grumpy person.

1351
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,080
Yeah, yeah, you are.

1352
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,080
As long as there's bacon, he's fine.

1353
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,040
Otherwise, I'm a crook.

1354
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:26,320
At the weekend, I had three or four people come up to me in person and say, do you know

1355
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,320
what?

1356
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:28,320
It was good that you were on...

1357
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:29,320
Unplugged.

1358
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:30,320
Keep it crystalline.

1359
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:31,320
Yeah, I know, right?

1360
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:32,320
Yeah, exactly.

1361
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:33,320
I've had a few people say that.

1362
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:34,320
I guess.

1363
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:37,160
But I'm not trying to get, you know, the...

1364
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:40,320
I think sometimes people forget I'm in the business of having an opinion.

1365
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:41,320
Sure.

1366
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:42,320
Gotta pass the piece tight around a little.

1367
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,320
And I'm not complaining.

1368
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:44,320
No, no, no.

1369
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:45,320
I think it's great fun that we can...

1370
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,320
And I know...

1371
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:47,320
I have a good...

1372
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:48,320
We have a good audience.

1373
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,320
Yeah, exactly.

1374
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:50,320
It's good fun.

1375
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:51,320
It's a lot of fun.

1376
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:55,560
And so I'm all about being more positive, but we have to, if we're going to do that,

1377
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:56,560
we have to find...

1378
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:59,440
It has to be something where everybody can have a good chance to get in and dig in on

1379
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:00,440
it.

1380
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:01,440
And the other thing is...

1381
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,840
It can't be Lego movie.

1382
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,840
Everything is awesome.

1383
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:05,840
Right.

1384
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:06,840
Right.

1385
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:07,840
Exactly.

1386
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:11,320
And on top of that, a lot of it is just driven by, you know, what the hell's going on.

1387
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:13,840
And unfortunately, it seems like it's been kind of shitty recently.

1388
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:14,840
Yeah.

1389
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:17,840
A lot of the newsworthy stuff tends to be negative anyway.

1390
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:18,840
Right.

1391
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:19,840
Because like...

1392
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,920
So a couple of weeks ago, it was Debian moving away from XFCE.

1393
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:25,200
So we talked about the XFCE project, which I think a lot of people are getting some of

1394
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,600
that negativity from.

1395
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:30,800
Also, you know, it's been pointed out to me that sometimes people just sort of prescribe

1396
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,720
any opinion mentioned in the show.

1397
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:35,200
They sort of assign it to me.

1398
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:38,200
They say, you know, it's Chris's opinion, or Chris thinks this, or Chris is being very

1399
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:39,200
negative.

1400
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:43,720
Well, when you start getting a little bit shouty, then I can see why.

1401
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:44,720
Yeah.

1402
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:45,720
And I understand.

1403
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:50,080
I can agree with that because I've put opinions out there and it got attributed to Chris.

1404
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:51,080
I'm like, what the...

1405
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,080
I mean, seriously, guys.

1406
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:54,080
My opinions are my own.

1407
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:56,080
They are not the opinions of Chris.

1408
01:36:56,080 --> 01:37:02,320
There's actually one subreddit comment where someone said what I said was Chris's comment.

1409
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:05,320
And I was like, no, let me explain what I actually said.

1410
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:06,320
Right.

1411
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,880
And that is more common than you'd think.

1412
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:11,200
And I think what it is is people are sort of in passing, you know, maybe they're doing

1413
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,200
something else.

1414
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:13,480
Some people are doing something else while they're listening.

1415
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:17,720
And so they don't remember exactly who said it, but they remember it was in that show.

1416
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:19,800
And then when they, maybe when they think of the show, they think of me or something

1417
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:20,800
like that.

1418
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:23,280
So, but again, I am actually not disagreeing.

1419
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:29,080
I am negative because I am, I think what it is, is I'm disappointed.

1420
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:32,540
I'm disappointed in the behavior of our community, right?

1421
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:33,540
That's what it is.

1422
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:36,000
And I know, but really, shouldn't I be?

1423
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,080
Like, isn't there a lot to be disappointed in with, like, look at all the stuff we just

1424
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:40,080
talked about this week.

1425
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,080
Look at all this silly.

1426
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:44,200
I mean, I mean, I feel bad for the people that are involved because to them it's not

1427
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:45,200
silly.

1428
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:48,800
But to those of us on the outside, actually the positive stuff, look at how much free

1429
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:54,240
software is made all day, every day, but where's the discussion there?

1430
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:56,400
Well, yeah, exactly.

1431
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,080
It doesn't, it doesn't generate clicks.

1432
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,080
It doesn't generate.

1433
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:00,080
No, it's not about that.

1434
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,080
It's not.

1435
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:02,080
No, no, it's not about that.

1436
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:08,520
It's really about, I think it's really about finding something we can chew on and you know,

1437
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:13,680
something that is, okay, so I'll tell you how, I'll tell you a little bit how I picked

1438
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,920
topics for this show because this show is sort of unscripted.

1439
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:21,680
But what I do is I look at what I think a lot of people seem to be thinking about in

1440
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:23,520
the Linux community this week.

1441
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:28,080
What's essentially right there in a bullet point, how Linux Unplugged is put together.

1442
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:29,080
What are people thinking about?

1443
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:30,080
Right, I'm not complaining.

1444
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,080
No, no, I know, I know, I know.

1445
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:34,000
No, I'm just kind of, cause I'm just for everybody's information.

1446
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,720
And so a lot of times, you know, it is, it is stuff that isn't super positive because

1447
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,360
it's something we're struggling with.

1448
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:44,720
And so this is sort of a forum to sort of, a lot of times we walk away trying to, you

1449
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:49,000
know, kind of put it all into perspective.

1450
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:54,040
And unfortunately that does mean sometimes we deal with stuff that is not of the, of

1451
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,520
the everything is awesome nature.

1452
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:59,880
Now that said, I do try to counterbalance some of that in last, right?

1453
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:01,600
Last is more of a showcase.

1454
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:02,600
Last is the news.

1455
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:03,600
This is what happened this week.

1456
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,040
These are awesome app picks.

1457
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,760
This is something we're spotlighting.

1458
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:08,280
This is how you do something.

1459
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:10,240
This is what the community wants to know, right?

1460
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:11,240
That's awesome.

1461
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:12,240
1410 is.

1462
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:13,240
Yeah.

1463
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:16,120
Well, it does happen because the news is, I know it does happen.

1464
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:17,120
It does.

1465
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,120
The news again is opinion.

1466
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:19,120
It does happen.

1467
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:24,000
But the majority focus of last is I would call a showcase where unplugged is more, it's

1468
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:29,040
more of Linux users grappling with what Linux users are thinking and caring about.

1469
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:34,400
And it's good fun, but it is, but it's reflective of what's going on in our community.

1470
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:35,400
Right.

1471
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:39,680
And you, you, you present, you know, multiple points of view and you give people in the

1472
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:40,680
mumble.

1473
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:42,480
Well, no, I'm not trying to get you to do that.

1474
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:43,600
I'm not trying to get you to do that.

1475
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:47,680
What am I, what I'm trying to just say is like, I'm not going out of my way to find

1476
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:48,680
negative stuff.

1477
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:49,680
I'm not saying you're trying to.

1478
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:50,680
I'm saying it does.

1479
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:51,680
It's a matter of fact.

1480
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,480
But then do we just ignore it though?

1481
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:54,760
Like that's how that's tough too.

1482
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:56,320
And that's almost seems disingenuous.

1483
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:57,320
Sure.

1484
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:01,720
You know, that's where I struggled because like, if we didn't talk about this and I,

1485
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:03,240
you know, Eric can attest to this.

1486
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:06,480
I was saying this morning on the tech talk today pre-show, I really didn't want to talk

1487
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:07,480
about this today.

1488
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:10,240
Like this isn't what I wanted our episode to be about.

1489
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:13,560
So, so I found this, sorry.

1490
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:20,240
I was just going to say, so I've found, I've found that when you go in, you start looking

1491
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:24,580
at them and talk about super technical things because a lot of people just aren't cynical

1492
01:40:24,580 --> 01:40:27,580
and they aren't watching the show to hear super technical things.

1493
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:31,720
So the things that you have talked about are the things that are kind of more on the things

1494
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:35,040
that they're really taught, you know, something you want to talk about and things that are

1495
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,480
very polarizing.

1496
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:39,880
And these are the things that will make you say, I hate this or I love this.

1497
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:40,880
Right.

1498
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:47,000
And also I look for, I look in our subreddit where there's a good, like good debates on

1499
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
both sides.

1500
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,720
Like somebody's making a good case for one side and some, and I'm like, oh, okay.

1501
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:53,520
So there's obviously a spectrum of discussion to be had here.

1502
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:57,120
And a lot of times, you know, with the good stuff, it's just good and there's really nothing

1503
01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:01,760
much to say, but I do, but I guess bullet point though, that I want to walk away from

1504
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:05,920
this whole chat is I'm totally down to like focusing more on the positive stuff.

1505
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:10,120
And to that end, we've had discussions about maybe working in some more of the maker type

1506
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:14,560
stuff and some of the cool creations into this show and then graduating in the last

1507
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:16,720
if it really seems to take traction and stuff like that.

1508
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:21,540
So we've had some discussions internally about how to sort of introduce more of this is what's

1509
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:23,720
awesomely happening and let's talk about that.

1510
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:27,680
But that for a particular talk show format is a little trickier than you might think,

1511
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,680
I think.

1512
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:29,680
Right.

1513
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:32,640
And I think it's good that you have multiple points of view.

1514
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:38,880
I think the whole this runs Linux, you know, kind of thing is brilliant because it's a

1515
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:43,440
voyage of discovery for all of us finding out all these machines that are randomly positioned

1516
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:46,600
around the world running Linux.

1517
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:52,600
But then you also need the counterpoint to that, which is, you know, the this German

1518
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:58,760
guy has decided that his city should not be running Linux or and let's discuss that or,

1519
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:00,720
you know, these people are being assholes.

1520
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:01,720
Let's discuss that.

1521
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:05,920
And I think a lot of times I think a lot of times we come away debunking some stuff not

1522
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,600
like the full on meaning of it, but like we walked away from that specifically the Germany

1523
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:13,360
thing, you know, kind of debunking what was happening there and really, hey, it's not

1524
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:14,360
that big of a deal.

1525
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:16,480
The press is just kind of having some fun with this.

1526
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:17,480
Yeah.

1527
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:22,160
And I don't see that covering that stuff and discussing it as a negative thing at all.

1528
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:25,960
I see that as a positive aspect in talking about positive things.

1529
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:28,240
We turned that story on its head.

1530
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:33,440
But I was I was almost certain that this is what would be discussed on today's show because

1531
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:36,720
it's played so heavily all over the the Internet.

1532
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:37,720
Right.

1533
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:39,800
You've been to the essential formula here.

1534
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:40,800
Yeah.

1535
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:49,040
But I was I was unsure if it was a good idea to go with it, though, because I I mean, Steve

1536
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:55,360
or Nichols really a shameful article that he posted because he basically just used the

1537
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:58,680
names of the personalities and two other words.

1538
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:00,880
And it was just horrible click.

1539
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:03,520
It's one of his worst in a long time.

1540
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:06,200
And yeah, I was really disappointed when I saw it.

1541
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:07,200
Yes.

1542
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:12,440
But also I was concerned that because this show has a platform, that this would just

1543
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:18,240
further the the dragging, you know, the Linux community through the mud.

1544
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:25,760
And I'm well, you know, I was really worried about when we started or when the topic was

1545
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:30,240
announced because, you know, Chris, I would say that, you know, the Jupiter Broadcasting

1546
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:35,520
and Linux Action Show and Linux Unplugged are the most popular Linux shows around.

1547
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:40,640
And remember, they are we have a hive mind when it comes to our open source things.

1548
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:47,360
So when you kind of get negative, everybody gets negative because you have so much power

1549
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:50,200
in a way, you know, with power comes responsibility here.

1550
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:52,080
You tell me I'm Spiderman up in this business.

1551
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:53,080
I don't think so.

1552
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:57,400
I always wanted to say that, but it does look how I ended, honestly, but go back to how

1553
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:01,280
I ended Linux Unplugged here is it's, you know, it doesn't, you know, it's it's individually

1554
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,280
our choices.

1555
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:03,280
Yeah.

1556
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:04,880
Whenever we get negative, everyone will.

1557
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:09,560
And when everyone kind of has a good time, the whole group, I'm not sure that's the case.

1558
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:15,200
I think I think Chris does have does have quite a platform here, but I don't think I

1559
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,560
don't think we have the hive mind that heavens was saying.

1560
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:18,960
I don't think plenty.

1561
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:24,360
I don't think everyone thinks, oh, Chris says, you know, he's not happy.

1562
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:30,800
I think maybe we're a lot of people who who will react the other way to whatever Chris

1563
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:31,800
says.

1564
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:32,800
We're conflating two things.

1565
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:37,060
So like sometimes in the mumble room, we'll get into a collective groove and kind of into

1566
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:39,000
a line of thinking.

1567
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,020
But that but have no illusion.

1568
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:47,560
People listening are not in that same collective groove at all in some cases, and they will

1569
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:49,400
very much make their voice heard.

1570
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:51,040
So it's pissed off.

1571
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:52,040
Yeah.

1572
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:55,000
I think we do a decent job of generally trying to stay out of that group.

1573
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,300
But it does happen sometimes because, you know, points build upon each other and people

1574
01:44:58,300 --> 01:45:00,000
start going, yeah, you know, that can happen.

1575
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
So it's.

1576
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Yeah.

1577
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Even last week.

1578
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,880
I mean, obviously, we don't always stick to what Chris says, because even last week,

1579
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:09,800
me and Popey were arguing against what he was saying in the show.

1580
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,680
So that's what we're here for.

1581
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,680
Yeah.

1582
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:13,680
I mean, hmm.

1583
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:14,680
Yeah.

1584
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:15,680
I so anyways.

1585
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:17,800
So you're not bitter about that, are you?

1586
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:18,920
Observations are taken.

1587
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:25,300
And I think, you know, hopefully, hopefully the community is I hope people listening understand

1588
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:28,200
that it's not that we're trying to focus on the bad aspects.

1589
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:30,040
We're kind of it's this is therapy.

1590
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:31,040
We're trying to work.

1591
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:33,800
These are things Linux users are thinking about and we're trying to work through it.

1592
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:38,400
And I hope more often than not, and I'm sure it doesn't happen all the time, but I hope

1593
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:42,880
more than more, more times, I hope on average, we get it right.

1594
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:47,320
I hope on average, we we walk away feeling a little bit better, having a better understanding

1595
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:51,800
and maybe changing the discussion a little bit for the better.
