WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.860
I don't usually go around from the rooftop shouting, have you heard of GIMP?

00:04.860 --> 00:06.380
Have you heard of GIMP?

00:06.380 --> 00:10.720
But this guy, four days ago, a story goes up about this guy who sucked so bad at Photoshop,

00:10.720 --> 00:16.140
he spent 10 years mastering Microsoft Paint to illustrate his book.

00:16.140 --> 00:19.440
And you know, I got to say he did a pretty good job, Wes.

00:19.440 --> 00:22.300
It looks like basically the quality of The Simpsons.

00:22.300 --> 00:26.000
So he got a lot out of Microsoft Paint.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
I mean, I'll give him that.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
When was the last time you did something like that in Paint?

00:29.000 --> 00:30.880
I would tell you it would be never.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.480
I didn't even know you could do something like this in Paint.

00:32.480 --> 00:34.520
I mean, you'd have to use wine, but still.

00:34.520 --> 00:40.720
He says, I honed my craft working long overnights at a hospital reception desk.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.680
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

00:42.680 --> 00:47.340
Then I decided to write and self-publish an e-book about summer camp in the 1980s.

00:47.340 --> 00:48.340
So it's pretty cool.

00:48.340 --> 00:49.340
It's all illustrated in Paint.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.340
Look at that.

00:50.340 --> 00:51.340
Yeah.

00:51.340 --> 00:55.480
But you got to stop and go, in 10 years, you never heard of GIMP?

00:55.480 --> 01:02.920
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's been running the benchmarks

01:02.920 --> 01:04.160
all day long.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.160
My name is Chris.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.160
My name is Wes.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.160
Hello, Wes.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.240
We have a great show today.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.800
You're already fired up and ready to go, too.

01:10.800 --> 01:11.800
You've been rehearsing.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.200
You've been practicing on that TechSnap program, so I know it's going to be good.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.200
Oh, yeah.

01:16.200 --> 01:20.280
As we go on the air, while I was at lunch, we have some really interesting news out of

01:20.280 --> 01:23.880
Canonical about what they might be doing with Ubuntu.

01:23.880 --> 01:24.880
We'll see.

01:24.880 --> 01:25.880
Ubuntu has two posts.

01:25.880 --> 01:29.840
We'll talk a little bit about the dues, and then we'll talk a little bit about the survey,

01:29.840 --> 01:33.280
which may give us more hints, too.

01:33.280 --> 01:34.280
I'm curious already.

01:34.280 --> 01:35.280
Yeah.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.920
I do have a little bit of a crisis of faith this week.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.680
Been looking at some of the news coming out of Microsoft's build.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.120
Yes, I said Microsoft's build conference.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.120
What?

01:44.120 --> 01:49.080
And they're bringing Bash to Windows Server.

01:49.080 --> 01:50.080
Server set.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.080
Yeah.

01:51.080 --> 01:52.080
Just getting serious.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.080
I know.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.080
They're going to have SSH on Windows Server in legit ways.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.240
So we're going to be talking about that, what that could mean for Linux.

01:56.240 --> 01:58.360
We're going to help you with your shell stuff.

01:58.360 --> 01:59.360
Got some shell problems?

01:59.360 --> 02:02.600
Well, now that it's on Windows, I mean, now it's serious business.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.360
That is literally why I was like, well, now people are going to have a bunch of noobs

02:05.360 --> 02:06.360
trying it out.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.360
It was literally my thoughts.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.880
Some community stuff to get into, and then one of our favorite open source projects on

02:10.880 --> 02:11.880
the show.

02:11.880 --> 02:14.440
We're just going to give you a little recap on what's been going on.

02:14.440 --> 02:18.680
And speaking of open source projects, our own community has been working on an amazing

02:18.680 --> 02:19.680
soundboard project.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.200
I can't wait to show you some of the things they've done.

02:22.200 --> 02:26.380
They've built something that's truly, truly feature rich and competitive.

02:26.380 --> 02:32.940
And then later on, towards the end of the show, but not quite, you know, it's not really

02:32.940 --> 02:33.940
the end.

02:33.940 --> 02:34.940
No, of course not.

02:34.940 --> 02:36.160
In some sense, it's a whole new beginning.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.360
We're going to talk about the Galago Pro.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.360
What?

02:38.360 --> 02:39.360
Yeah.

02:39.360 --> 02:43.160
We're going to do a little review of System76's brand new Galago Pro, which is in Wes's hot

02:43.160 --> 02:45.360
little hands right now.

02:45.360 --> 02:46.360
Performing very nicely.

02:46.360 --> 02:47.480
But that's just a tease.

02:47.480 --> 02:48.480
That's me tapping it.

02:48.480 --> 02:49.480
Yeah, that's real metal.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.040
Have you fingered that logo?

02:51.040 --> 02:52.280
Turn your hands over that logo right there.

02:52.280 --> 02:53.280
You feel how good that is?

02:53.280 --> 02:54.280
Yeah, man.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.280
It's baked in.

02:55.280 --> 02:56.280
It's baked in.

02:56.280 --> 02:57.280
It's baked in.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.560
So we'll be talking about that coming up in a little bit today.

02:58.560 --> 02:59.560
A bunch of stuff.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.000
Bunch of bunch of stuff.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
It's good to be here.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
I'm glad.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.640
I feel like, Wes, I feel like I've just recently given delivery to a new baby.

03:08.640 --> 03:09.640
Right.

03:09.640 --> 03:10.640
That's a big moment for you.

03:10.640 --> 03:11.640
I've been doing a lot of things.

03:11.640 --> 03:12.640
So what have you been doing?

03:12.640 --> 03:13.640
You been up to anything interesting?

03:13.640 --> 03:14.640
All kinds of stuff.

03:14.640 --> 03:15.640
Yeah.

03:15.640 --> 03:16.640
Yeah.

03:16.640 --> 03:17.960
But I don't know if it can compare with what you have just birthed to the world.

03:17.960 --> 03:18.960
I don't want to take.

03:18.960 --> 03:19.960
I don't want to take this.

03:19.960 --> 03:23.480
I don't want to take away the spotlight, Wes, but pretty excited about Linux Action News

03:23.480 --> 03:24.780
episode one.

03:24.780 --> 03:25.780
Pretty excited.

03:25.780 --> 03:26.780
You should be.

03:26.780 --> 03:29.040
Linuxactionnews.com if you want to check it out.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.200
Joe Ressington and me.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.160
What's the elevator pitch here?

03:32.160 --> 03:33.680
Think of it as this.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.300
It's Joe and I who've been doing podcasting for a long time.

03:36.300 --> 03:40.320
It's our take on the weekly happenings in Linux and open source.

03:40.320 --> 03:47.240
And I started this show with Joe because I thought things are really changing in Linux.

03:47.240 --> 03:50.800
There's a new reality that's in some ways extremely great for Linux and there's a few

03:50.800 --> 03:54.700
other headwinds that are really concerning and so much stuff is developing.

03:54.700 --> 03:57.520
It's really a great time to have a good discussion show.

03:57.520 --> 04:03.480
And Joe has not only just a great take on the open source world and he's been following

04:03.480 --> 04:09.120
it for a long time, but from his experience with Linux Luddites and now Late Night Linux,

04:09.120 --> 04:15.880
all both of which are great shows, he's really developed a routine and a system down to collect

04:15.880 --> 04:18.320
news and analyze news and really think about it really well.

04:18.320 --> 04:21.920
So I knew like just from the podcasters I listened to, he'd be one of the best guys

04:21.920 --> 04:22.920
to do the show.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.040
I was like, well maybe Joe would want to do it.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.640
And then it turned out, yeah, Joe did want to do it with me.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.640
I was like, awesome.

04:26.640 --> 04:27.640
That was like my first choice.

04:27.640 --> 04:28.640
Totally.

04:28.640 --> 04:33.880
And the thing was is when we announced the end of the Linux action show, the biggest

04:33.880 --> 04:36.760
feedback we got is people really liked the news.

04:36.760 --> 04:41.520
And they tuned in to find out what was going on each week with Linux and open source.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.280
You were their evening news program.

04:43.280 --> 04:47.120
And for some people it's like, well this is my living, this is kind of how I make my living

04:47.120 --> 04:55.280
and it's helpful to just have another resource to stay up to date on stuff, to keep current.

04:55.280 --> 04:59.840
And so it was kind of with sort of the lessons learned from Linux action show and that kind

04:59.840 --> 05:02.840
of market in mind that we launched this show.

05:02.840 --> 05:03.840
It's still early days.

05:03.840 --> 05:09.520
The first few episodes are always kind of early days, kind of like rough.

05:09.520 --> 05:12.840
It's not like it's rough because he and I have been doing it for so long that it's not

05:12.840 --> 05:13.840
amateurs.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.600
But at the same time it's like not what the final product is going to be.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.600
You're still finding the right energy, how you want it to go.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.160
And then of course there's all the cool stuff that we've been working on, like back end

05:22.160 --> 05:26.560
technology to make it all possible and new hosting and all this kind of stuff.

05:26.560 --> 05:31.160
It was a lot of work to get there and we're super excited because episode one is out.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.160
I think it's been received pretty well.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.160
I think so.

05:33.160 --> 05:36.760
So I'd love to have you guys at least try it out and maybe consider it.

05:36.760 --> 05:37.880
It's a little bit tighter of a show.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.880
It's usually going to be about 30 minutes or so, so that means you've really got some

05:40.880 --> 05:45.200
time to fit it into maybe an already busy podcast schedule or a commute.

05:45.200 --> 05:48.880
It should be never like one of those shows that's going to monopolize your entire podcast

05:48.880 --> 05:49.880
player for the week.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.120
So what's the schedule going to be?

05:51.120 --> 05:52.120
Mondays.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.680
So hopefully it'll be out every Monday.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.480
It's going to be a good day for the network.

05:56.480 --> 05:59.560
News show out on Monday, four-year morning download.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.320
You can listen to it whenever you want in the week, but if you want to start your Monday

06:02.320 --> 06:05.320
with it or if you – so I figure we'll put it out there and whenever people want to listen

06:05.320 --> 06:06.320
to it they'll listen.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.320
I think that's great.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.320
Yeah.

06:08.320 --> 06:09.320
I'm excited.

06:09.320 --> 06:13.200
If you want to just go to episode one it's linuxactionnews.com slash one.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.200
Pretty simple.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.200
Easy peasy.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.200
I don't know if the WW is working or not.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.560
We'll find out later.

06:17.560 --> 06:18.560
I blame Dan Benjamin.

06:18.560 --> 06:19.560
I blame Dan Benjamin.

06:19.560 --> 06:20.560
All right.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.320
Well, so let's talk about actual news.

06:22.320 --> 06:29.240
This was posted over at OMG Ubuntu just one hour ago, as literally one hour ago as we're

06:29.240 --> 06:30.820
recording right now.

06:30.820 --> 06:35.840
The Ubuntu desktop team has discussed some of their plans for Gnome on Ubuntu 17.10 and

06:35.840 --> 06:39.840
things have sort of settled since Mark's initial announcement and people are processing

06:39.840 --> 06:42.600
it going through the stages of grief with some of the Unity users.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.520
It seems like they kind of picked up that people like needed a little bit more info

06:45.520 --> 06:47.800
to really understand what this might look like.

06:47.800 --> 06:51.480
XFCE users started walking around saying, I told you so over and over again.

06:51.480 --> 06:54.400
You know, everybody's got their time.

06:54.400 --> 06:58.040
And so we've been all curious to really kind of find out what would Canonical really do.

06:58.040 --> 07:01.240
I mean, are they really just going to ship stock Ubuntu?

07:01.240 --> 07:07.640
And so Kevin Van Dyne, I think, Van Dyne, I just Kevin V from Canonical, he's worked

07:07.640 --> 07:08.640
there for eight years.

07:08.640 --> 07:09.640
So I'm sorry, Kevin.

07:09.640 --> 07:10.640
You're never going to learn it at this point.

07:10.640 --> 07:13.760
Yeah, well, yeah, because he and I talk so often.

07:13.760 --> 07:16.960
He spent the past three years working on various parts of the Unity 8 stack and he's now part

07:16.960 --> 07:19.720
of the Ubuntu desktop team.

07:19.720 --> 07:22.060
Now I think we should just start right there.

07:22.060 --> 07:23.480
There was a Unity 8 team.

07:23.480 --> 07:24.820
There's not a Unity 8 team.

07:24.820 --> 07:29.240
But if you notice the way Joey wrote this, he's now moved to the Ubuntu desktop team,

07:29.240 --> 07:33.320
which tells us there is, in fact, an Ubuntu desktop.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.640
So that's an interesting little bit.

07:34.640 --> 07:38.080
And he's tasked with the successful switch over to Gnome.

07:38.080 --> 07:44.600
And they kind of I think we might be seeing a more customized Gnome from Ubuntu than we

07:44.600 --> 07:47.320
were originally sort of led to believe because we had some worries that it was just going

07:47.320 --> 07:48.320
to be like this.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.960
They're just going to ship stock and that's not going to be great.

07:50.960 --> 07:51.960
Mark said something to that effect.

07:51.960 --> 07:55.600
It's like they're going to ship Gnome as Gnome intended to be.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.800
But nobody's a huge fan of that, really.

07:57.800 --> 08:03.480
And so Joey over at OMG Ubuntu asked Kevin if they plan to customize Ubuntu Gnome 17.10.

08:03.480 --> 08:06.680
And it looks like they're kind of making some considerations.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.360
Few tweaks here and there he says.

08:08.360 --> 08:11.120
We want to give our users a good experience.

08:11.120 --> 08:14.840
And so they're launching a poll with the help of OMG Ubuntu to try to figure out what some

08:14.840 --> 08:17.560
of those tweaks should be.

08:17.560 --> 08:22.040
And so OMG Ubuntu has launched a short survey that Canonical is apparently listening to

08:22.040 --> 08:24.360
and they're going to take in some of the feedback too.

08:24.360 --> 08:28.960
So it seems like a good opportunity to tell them what you'd like to see in the Gnome desktop.

08:28.960 --> 08:32.360
Kind of a unique opportunity, I mean really kind of an incredible opportunity if you think

08:32.360 --> 08:33.360
about it.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.360
This is one of those ones where later you're going to complain and we're going to be like,

08:35.360 --> 08:36.360
well, did you vote?

08:36.360 --> 08:38.560
Did you go to that survey?

08:38.560 --> 08:41.240
This was posted 40 minutes ago, by the way.

08:41.240 --> 08:45.200
So yeah, so this is all still happening pretty fast right now.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.320
So here's just a little idea.

08:47.320 --> 08:52.400
Here's some of the extensions that people are being asked to rate, Dash to Dock, Impatience,

08:52.400 --> 09:00.520
No Top, Left Hot Corner, Alternate Tab, Applications Menu, Better Volume Indicator, Top Icons Plus.

09:00.520 --> 09:01.520
Is that your fan?

09:01.520 --> 09:02.520
Is your fan kicking up?

09:02.520 --> 09:03.520
I think so, yeah.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.080
Yeah, it does that sometimes.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.080
So there you go.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.000
That's what they're looking at.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.200
I kind of want to take the survey.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.400
Yeah, you should.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.400
Should I do it?

09:13.400 --> 09:14.400
Do it.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.400
Dash to Dock, what do you think?

09:15.400 --> 09:16.400
Not useful or very useful?

09:16.400 --> 09:17.400
Mumble room.

09:17.400 --> 09:18.400
Oh wait, let's bring the mumble room in.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.400
Yeah, what are we doing?

09:19.400 --> 09:20.400
Let's make it official.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.400
They can help us take it too.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.800
We'll bring them in right now.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.920
Time appropriate greetings there, mumble room.

09:24.920 --> 09:28.520
Hello everybody.

09:28.520 --> 09:29.520
So what do you say?

09:29.520 --> 09:31.000
Should we take the survey together?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Sure.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Absolutely.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.640
Ready for it?

09:34.640 --> 09:38.560
Okay, Dash to Dock, useful or not useful?

09:38.560 --> 09:40.440
What say you, mumble room?

09:40.440 --> 09:41.920
Useful or not useful?

09:41.920 --> 09:42.920
Five.

09:42.920 --> 09:43.920
Useful.

09:43.920 --> 09:44.920
Yeah.

09:44.920 --> 09:45.920
Very useful.

09:45.920 --> 09:46.920
Definitely useful.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.520
I figure I could probably figure out the number rating based on how many people say useful

09:50.520 --> 09:51.520
or not useful.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.320
Like if a lot of people say useful, then it's more of a five, and if less people say, then

09:54.320 --> 09:55.320
I'll say it's...

09:55.320 --> 09:56.320
Okay.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.480
So impatience.

09:57.480 --> 10:01.440
Impatience speeds up the GNOME desktop animations for minimizing and maximizing windows and

10:01.440 --> 10:03.440
triggering overlays and things like that.

10:03.440 --> 10:06.560
Would you say this is a useful extension or not useful extension?

10:06.560 --> 10:07.560
Never useful.

10:07.560 --> 10:08.560
Useful.

10:08.560 --> 10:09.560
Yeah.

10:09.560 --> 10:10.560
Okay.

10:10.560 --> 10:11.560
All right.

10:11.560 --> 10:12.560
I'm going to give that one more of a three.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.560
Yeah, middle of the road there.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.560
Yeah.

10:14.560 --> 10:15.560
No top left hot corner.

10:15.560 --> 10:18.920
This disables the top left hot corner in GNOME, which triggers your desktop and makes

10:18.920 --> 10:23.160
everything move around like I just did on my video screen here.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.160
What do you say?

10:24.160 --> 10:25.160
No top left hot corner.

10:25.160 --> 10:28.440
Is that a very useful thing or not useful?

10:28.440 --> 10:29.440
I don't care.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.440
Useful.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.440
I think it's pretty useful.

10:31.440 --> 10:32.440
Sounds like it.

10:32.440 --> 10:33.440
I'm going to influence it.

10:33.440 --> 10:34.440
I think I like the...

10:34.440 --> 10:35.440
I'm going to give it a four.

10:35.440 --> 10:38.880
See, I've never thought about it before, but just during this last TechSnap program, I

10:38.880 --> 10:41.400
was like, boy, it'd be nice if this didn't happen all the time.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.360
Yeah, it does get you when you're broadcasting.

10:43.360 --> 10:44.360
Yeah.

10:44.360 --> 10:45.360
Alternate tab.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.840
I'm just going to give that a middle of the road because I want to move on.

10:46.840 --> 10:49.040
I don't want to take all day on the survey.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.960
Turns out there's like Linux news or something.

10:50.960 --> 10:51.960
Okay.

10:51.960 --> 10:52.960
Here's the thing, though.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.680
This is the one that I am very torn up about, and this is the one I've actually wanted to

10:55.680 --> 10:56.880
get everybody's opinion on the strongest.

10:56.880 --> 11:01.440
The applications menu, which introduces a category-based app menu for searching and

11:01.440 --> 11:07.800
opening applications, which replaces the full screen applications menu in default GNOME.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.060
Useful or not useful?

11:11.060 --> 11:12.640
Useful for new users.

11:12.640 --> 11:13.640
Fair.

11:13.640 --> 11:14.640
Okay.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.760
I feel like it's also a bit of an atrocity, though.

11:17.760 --> 11:22.280
I mean, it's a huge diversion from the way the default environment-

11:22.280 --> 11:23.440
I've actually never tried it.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.440
I have.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.440
It's okay.

11:25.440 --> 11:26.440
It's okay.

11:26.440 --> 11:27.440
It's no brisk.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.440
It's fine.

11:28.440 --> 11:29.440
It's fine.

11:29.440 --> 11:34.600
I guess I hadn't really thought about the new user angle.

11:34.600 --> 11:38.400
It can be nice to have sorted categories to find things.

11:38.400 --> 11:39.400
Yep.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.400
Yep.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.400
That's one of the reasons I deal with mate.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.880
Do you think we should be catering to new users?

11:43.880 --> 11:46.240
That's a very legitimate question.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.240
Oh, boy.

11:47.240 --> 11:51.200
See, here's the thing is I was going to make that an entire discussion in today's show

11:51.200 --> 11:57.000
because I think that is the question of Linux going forward is I think we should really

11:57.000 --> 12:02.120
refrain from even considering the new user because we are fooling ourselves at this point.

12:02.120 --> 12:04.240
I don't mean to be a Debbie Downer about this.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.720
I wasn't necessarily going to get into this because I'm still trying to put my thoughts

12:06.720 --> 12:08.040
together on this.

12:08.040 --> 12:11.200
But you look at this news from Canonical.

12:11.200 --> 12:17.480
Okay, so here's the thing, Wes.

12:17.480 --> 12:23.720
If Canonical couldn't do it, I mean there's been no greater success in desktop Linux history

12:23.720 --> 12:25.360
than the Ubuntu desktop.

12:25.360 --> 12:29.060
There has been no desktop that has been prepackaged, no Linux desktop that has been prepackaged

12:29.060 --> 12:32.520
with hardware manufacturers more than the Ubuntu desktop.

12:32.520 --> 12:39.800
There has never been a greater success story in desktop Linux than Ubuntu, Unity 7 even.

12:39.800 --> 12:48.680
And if they can't pull it off, I would argue that it's not a measurement of the technological

12:48.680 --> 12:52.000
prowess of the mere display server.

12:52.000 --> 12:57.680
I would argue that it is not the buttons on the left-hand side of the Unity 7 windows

12:57.680 --> 12:59.640
that prevented these things from happening.

12:59.640 --> 13:07.400
I would argue that there is just simply no real market pressure in the West that is driving

13:07.400 --> 13:14.160
consumers to seek out a solution that is not Windows, Mac, or Chrome OS or tablets.

13:14.160 --> 13:21.020
In countries like China and India and other places, of course, there are different market

13:21.020 --> 13:23.160
factors at play.

13:23.160 --> 13:27.160
And those consumers have been driven to seek out different solutions.

13:27.160 --> 13:31.000
And so there it is successful.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.040
But in order to be successful in the West, it just seems it's an impossibility.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.400
It is amongst the average consumer.

13:37.400 --> 13:44.880
Now certain niches like engineering, software development, certain levels of high-end media

13:44.880 --> 13:51.400
production, it seems likely that Linux will continue to just win there amongst people

13:51.400 --> 13:54.240
who are seeking out a market alternative.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.280
For whatever reason, the one they're using isn't fulfilling their need.

13:57.280 --> 14:03.080
But that is just simply, simply, simply not the case for your most average consumer, the

14:03.080 --> 14:05.920
quote, unquote, new user coming to Linux.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.340
I don't believe they exist.

14:07.340 --> 14:11.600
So maybe are there multiple tiers here of new user and what we should give up on or

14:11.600 --> 14:16.800
not focus on anyway is this very casual user we have to cater to?

14:16.800 --> 14:21.460
Because maybe we do still want it to be easy for the engineer coming from Windows to get

14:21.460 --> 14:23.360
here who's willing to learn a little.

14:23.360 --> 14:27.140
You still want to be able to, as a Linux enthusiast and geek, you still want to be able to solve

14:27.140 --> 14:31.800
somebody's problem by taking some crappy Windows install off their laptop and putting Linux

14:31.800 --> 14:32.800
on there for them.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.320
You want them to be able to use it.

14:34.320 --> 14:40.140
So there's obviously this quote, unquote, new user that we're always sort of theoretically

14:40.140 --> 14:44.000
trying to make sure that software is easy to install so that they're happy and that

14:44.000 --> 14:48.040
themes look right so that it's pleasant to them and that we have things like application

14:48.040 --> 14:52.400
menus that completely overwrite the way that the desktop environment has been designed

14:52.400 --> 14:53.720
to work.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.720
It's not like GNOME accidentally doesn't have an applications menu.

14:56.720 --> 14:58.320
That's some serious intentional design.

14:58.320 --> 15:03.720
Well, and for me, it's like, also, I don't want us to think about this new user, super

15:03.720 --> 15:07.200
new user, whatever, at the expense of power users.

15:07.200 --> 15:11.480
Because for me, one thing I love about GNOME is I hit that key and I type the thing that

15:11.480 --> 15:13.840
I want that I know that I want and I get it immediately.

15:13.840 --> 15:16.560
And there are some systems where that's not the case, and especially if I have to go browse

15:16.560 --> 15:18.480
through this menu to this thing that I already want.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.680
It's not a workflow that I'm going to use and it drives me away from it.

15:20.680 --> 15:21.680
Yeah.

15:21.680 --> 15:24.620
Wimpy, what are your thoughts?

15:24.620 --> 15:26.880
You raise a lot of good points there.

15:26.880 --> 15:33.020
The first, so going all the way back to the applications menu in GNOME, I don't think

15:33.020 --> 15:39.480
that that should be included because it's a real departure from how GNOME is designed

15:39.480 --> 15:40.480
to work.

15:40.480 --> 15:41.480
Totally.

15:41.480 --> 15:47.440
And to follow on from that, you're kind of right about the new user thing.

15:47.440 --> 15:53.920
I would say anecdotally, I do see a lot of new users coming to Linux for the first time

15:53.920 --> 15:55.640
through Ubuntu MATE.

15:55.640 --> 16:01.720
So through that community, I see new people joining all the time.

16:01.720 --> 16:05.840
Is that, do you feel unique or do you think that, is it unique because Ubuntu MATE is

16:05.840 --> 16:11.560
super appealing to Raspberry Pis and reclaiming old hardware or do you think maybe I just

16:11.560 --> 16:13.440
am missing the boat on that particular point?

16:13.440 --> 16:14.440
Okay.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.000
So I'm excluding Raspberry Pis from that.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
These are people that have had Windows on a computer and are now running Ubuntu MATE

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
on a computer.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.840
And I don't know what the numbers are like.

16:24.840 --> 16:29.200
I'm not saying it's millions or anything, but certainly they're out there.

16:29.200 --> 16:33.840
They're out there enough that I've seen enough posts in the forums to register that there

16:33.840 --> 16:36.820
are this group of people that are new to Linux.

16:36.820 --> 16:40.600
And if you speak to the elementary guys, I think that they would tell you the same as

16:40.600 --> 16:41.600
well.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.800
So they are out there.

16:42.800 --> 16:47.880
But what I would also say is that I think you're right, that Ubuntu has had good success

16:47.880 --> 16:51.120
in appealing to a professional market.

16:51.120 --> 16:59.400
And I think the default Ubuntu desktop should be geared towards professionals and specifically

16:59.400 --> 17:07.400
developers and the flavors I think can attract the consumer market.

17:07.400 --> 17:12.060
Wow, that's a powerful statement.

17:12.060 --> 17:17.720
So I suppose I have some personal experience recently if we're going with anecdotal experience

17:17.720 --> 17:23.960
of her Mother's Day, family member that I didn't even know was using Ubuntu, turned

17:23.960 --> 17:28.240
out to be using Ubuntu, because some computer guy that helped her fix her computer told

17:28.240 --> 17:29.240
her to install it.

17:29.240 --> 17:30.240
Really?

17:30.240 --> 17:31.240
And she didn't even know it was Ubuntu.

17:31.240 --> 17:36.400
If I didn't see that Unity sidebar in that classic background, you should have seen the

17:36.400 --> 17:37.400
double tag.

17:37.400 --> 17:38.400
What?

17:38.400 --> 17:39.400
What?

17:39.400 --> 17:40.400
What?

17:40.400 --> 17:41.400
What?

17:41.400 --> 17:42.400
What?

17:42.400 --> 17:43.400
What?

17:43.400 --> 17:44.400
What?

17:44.400 --> 17:45.400
What?

17:45.400 --> 17:46.400
What?

17:46.400 --> 17:47.400
What?

17:47.400 --> 17:48.400
So I think she had no agenda.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.400
She doesn't really care.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.900
She just wants to be all ease the internet.

17:50.900 --> 17:51.900
Right.

17:51.900 --> 17:55.440
So Wimpy you could be right, and to a certain degree, maybe I'm being a little more extra

17:55.440 --> 17:56.440
pessimistic.

17:56.440 --> 17:59.800
I think it's probably what you're saying, is I'm being a little pessimistic, but I definitely

17:59.800 --> 18:04.560
feel like we're spinning our wheels and wasting our time constantly theorizing about a theoretical

18:04.560 --> 18:08.180
user when it's not really an applicable…

18:08.180 --> 18:12.920
Okay, so I guess I want to shift gears because there is a new user that is out there, that

18:12.920 --> 18:17.040
it seems to be a real number and that would be say India and China, where people are walking

18:17.040 --> 18:20.240
into stores and buying Ubuntu machines and there's totally different market dynamics

18:20.240 --> 18:21.240
there.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.240
What about them?

18:22.240 --> 18:26.240
Don't they deserve a custom built desktop?

18:26.240 --> 18:29.400
Or are they shipping something like Ubuntu Chillin and maybe it's just a totally different

18:29.400 --> 18:30.400
experience.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.400
Right.

18:31.400 --> 18:37.400
Well in China that's exactly what they're getting but in general I mean is Ubuntu currently

18:37.400 --> 18:39.760
geared towards one audience or the other?

18:39.760 --> 18:45.080
Is it particularly new user friendly or is it developer friendly or is it pro user friendly

18:45.080 --> 18:48.120
or is it just general purpose?

18:48.120 --> 18:50.240
And I don't think that's going to change in Ubuntu right.

18:50.240 --> 18:55.480
I think that whichever way these desktop extensions go and the way GNOME is implemented it's going

18:55.480 --> 19:00.720
to be just as applicable to new users and pro users.

19:00.720 --> 19:06.560
I think what's important is that these extensions just make things intuitive.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.320
So here's how I kind of fell down on it.

19:08.320 --> 19:13.520
I said applications menu I'm going to say not useful much I'm not going to say one but

19:13.520 --> 19:20.920
hear me out, hear me out, hear me out because I also rated better volume indicator as not

19:20.920 --> 19:26.680
very useful and then I put top icons as four which is pretty useful and window controls

19:26.680 --> 19:27.680
on the right.

19:27.680 --> 19:28.680
Now hear me out.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.520
Here's why I started bailing a little bit on some of these extensions.

19:30.520 --> 19:38.640
I get nervous about the idea of stock Ubuntu shipping all hacked up with extensions.

19:38.640 --> 19:42.360
There's like a hard limit on the number that we should really be comfortable with is what

19:42.360 --> 19:43.360
you're saying here.

19:43.360 --> 19:46.680
So I'm starting to look at these and I'm starting to go not totally necessary to make

19:46.680 --> 19:47.860
GNOME usable.

19:47.860 --> 19:51.600
Especially if Ubuntu is not doing anything anymore right like they're not guaranteeing

19:51.600 --> 19:55.120
the stability of these things or that they'll always be consistent necessarily.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.440
So that depends too right.

19:57.440 --> 20:00.360
Especially if we are still concerned about new users if we do have these extensions breaking

20:00.360 --> 20:03.680
your whole experience that that's not great.

20:03.680 --> 20:08.160
These extensions are going to have to be packaged in order to be part of the image so that means

20:08.160 --> 20:12.040
that they're going to be maintained and therefore they will work release to release.

20:12.040 --> 20:15.640
It's not like I suppose if you're on LTS it's not like you're going to go from a major version

20:15.640 --> 20:16.640
of GNOME.

20:16.640 --> 20:17.640
Yeah.

20:17.640 --> 20:18.640
Yeah.

20:18.640 --> 20:21.880
So but I still I still think probably some discretion would be would be advised on how

20:21.880 --> 20:22.880
many extensions.

20:22.880 --> 20:27.400
So anyways if you want to go vote yourself you can go to OMG Ubuntu Joey just put those

20:27.400 --> 20:31.340
up and it sounds like this is a you know an interesting conversation that I would bet

20:31.340 --> 20:36.480
is probably like likely happening at all different levels at Canonical too.

20:36.480 --> 20:42.600
So we still haven't gotten a lot of details on Fedora or SUSE on the Windows Linux subsystem

20:42.600 --> 20:45.360
thing which is kind of strange or whatever the hell everyone's already running arch on

20:45.360 --> 20:47.520
that thing anyway.

20:47.520 --> 20:48.520
Good one.

20:48.520 --> 20:52.080
And maybe it doesn't matter because pretty soon you're going to be running bash on your

20:52.080 --> 20:56.240
Windows servers Windows servers Windows servers running bash.

20:56.240 --> 21:01.840
See there was a time when I would have I actually did climb very tall mountains to get SSH working

21:01.840 --> 21:02.840
on Windows.

21:02.840 --> 21:05.640
Well how else were you going to administer them back in the day.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.800
I guess now there's like WinRM and more options.

21:08.800 --> 21:09.800
Yeah.

21:09.800 --> 21:16.800
And and I also had to bend over backwards to get event logs into Syslog and all of these

21:16.800 --> 21:22.880
tools were either made possible by Cygwin or something that like bundled up Cygwin on

21:22.880 --> 21:25.720
its own in its own little Cygwin environment.

21:25.720 --> 21:27.920
It was always it was always the hacky at best.

21:27.920 --> 21:28.920
Yeah.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.640
And just felt so ancient.

21:30.640 --> 21:35.280
So now I can only imagine if I if I was stuck around administering Windows servers and if

21:35.280 --> 21:42.620
I could get a legitimate Ubuntu LTS bash shell or Fedora shell or Sousa that would be a game

21:42.620 --> 21:46.960
changer for me because my bash grips now I could take so many of my I mean in theory

21:46.960 --> 21:51.040
I would have access to cron which is way better than the Windows scheduler like all of these

21:51.040 --> 21:55.120
things would shift for me I would have access to so many tools I could have I could have

21:55.120 --> 22:00.080
good old traditional nmap right there on a Windows server which would be very useful.

22:00.080 --> 22:03.680
For me I wonder how much I wonder how well like what's the interaction like between those

22:03.680 --> 22:10.080
two because if I can start using like the Linux or the new tools that I know and love

22:10.080 --> 22:13.240
to start maybe applying some automation to the Windows side not that I want to do that

22:13.240 --> 22:17.440
but I could certainly see people wanting to do that there's also the scary thought of

22:17.440 --> 22:22.120
like well now people can start doing like Windows server you know you have like Docker

22:22.120 --> 22:26.160
containers for Windows that spin up different like more little Windows server containers

22:26.160 --> 22:31.700
that each have different bash Linux distributions inside so your next VBS might be running on

22:31.700 --> 22:38.440
Windows server Chris. Jeez wow. Yeah Docker is also by the way so I have linked in the

22:38.440 --> 22:44.020
show notes the Microsoft server for developers blog also Windows server is joining the Windows

22:44.020 --> 22:47.680
insider program so if you want to run beta versions of stuff on your Windows server that's

22:47.680 --> 22:53.040
kind of cool actually I guess they but back to the containerization thing they said the

22:53.040 --> 22:59.360
nano server that they came up with is picking up in popularity and they're gonna they're

22:59.360 --> 23:04.960
gonna focus on providing the very best container foundation for developers with a nano server

23:04.960 --> 23:11.800
that's okay it's so small yeah and they're gonna and they're also expanding their Docker

23:11.800 --> 23:17.840
support which will use Hyper-V isolation technology and you can use your choice of Linux kernel

23:17.840 --> 23:22.160
to host the workload while the management scripts and tool could use the Windows subsystem

23:22.160 --> 23:30.740
for Linux. Oh wow. So you can run you can pick and match your your container it is isolated

23:30.740 --> 23:35.820
using Hyper-V and you can pick and match the Linux kernel that that container runs on top

23:35.820 --> 23:44.320
of and then you can manage it all with bash on a Windows server. Wow what kind of world

23:44.320 --> 23:47.200
do we live in now I don't even know how I don't know how to feel about this. I think

23:47.200 --> 23:51.240
we live in one where Microsoft figured out how to seriously successfully compete with

23:51.240 --> 23:59.160
Linux yeah in a way that is going to fundamentally potentially shift the market maybe I mean

23:59.160 --> 24:03.240
it's not like you've been able to run VM Linux VMs on Windows boxes for years yeah right

24:03.240 --> 24:09.560
so I don't know it does see it in some ways I don't know what the server side is gonna

24:09.560 --> 24:12.560
do I don't know how that will change things that I'm not I haven't really thought about

24:12.560 --> 24:16.360
that seems more to me for some reason it seems like a bigger deal than the desktop that's

24:16.360 --> 24:19.600
what I was gonna say for the desktop side it feels like well like half of everyone's

24:19.600 --> 24:23.360
already stuck on Windows at work anyway it seems like to me it was this is more of a

24:23.360 --> 24:27.960
threat to Mac OS desktops than it is to because like who's running the Linux desktop there

24:27.960 --> 24:31.160
anyway either you are and you're not gonna change to go to Windows just because of this

24:31.160 --> 24:34.760
or you're already stuck on Windows but if you have a Mac suddenly like Windows looks

24:34.760 --> 24:39.040
kind of better than a Mac in some ways for running closer to a real Linux you know especially

24:39.040 --> 24:42.620
if you want a variety of hardware choices or you need to work with a vendor that your

24:42.620 --> 24:47.600
company already orders from. MonkeyGum do you want to walk me off the ledge a bit? Yeah

24:47.600 --> 24:52.440
the nano thing isn't all that's replacing is everyone that's running VM workstation

24:52.440 --> 24:58.360
with a Linux image running inside of it that's all it's doing because it's a piece of hardware

24:58.360 --> 25:03.640
and yeah it's just replacing the VM workstation that's all it's doing. No it's not a bad

25:03.640 --> 25:09.000
market for them to get into yeah I don't really follow it very closely I don't really have

25:09.000 --> 25:12.600
much interest in. You're not in the insiders program? No I don't and I don't have any interest

25:12.600 --> 25:18.960
in Windows Nano server but I do I just. They really are doing a lot of work to try to be

25:18.960 --> 25:24.980
competitive. This is making me have a serious crisis of faith right now like excuse me today

25:24.980 --> 25:30.480
there was a rumor that got posted that there's gonna be refreshed MacBooks at WWDC and even

25:30.480 --> 25:33.660
if they're not at WWDC you know they're gonna be out in the fall there's also gonna be a

25:33.660 --> 25:39.560
new iMac workstation I would I would expect it probably to be Xeon with ECC memory. Yeah

25:39.560 --> 25:44.640
right there's been talk of a new pro at some point. Yep yep so it's not like the Mac OS

25:44.640 --> 25:47.720
platform is gonna sit still forever within six months they're pretty much gonna have

25:47.720 --> 25:55.400
their shit together. Now on Windows you've got Bash on you've got SUSE Fedora and Ubuntu

25:55.400 --> 26:01.300
on Windows 10. In the store. So you can you can basically have your dev environment match

26:01.300 --> 26:05.880
production on your Windows 10 machine that also lets you play your Steam games and has

26:05.880 --> 26:12.200
all the other crap that I guess Windows users like and then and then we get left with on

26:12.200 --> 26:19.440
in Linux we have really I mean Gnome is it's not like it's some huge project like there's

26:19.440 --> 26:24.360
a lot riding on something that is not like it's that huge and it was just a couple of

26:24.360 --> 26:34.640
years ago teetering on bankruptcy. Is this a good time to bring up plasma? Yes. I mean

26:34.640 --> 26:40.120
yeah I know I'm just saying like more than ever our our independent desktop projects

26:40.120 --> 26:44.840
are going to be more important than ever. And it does feel like just I just wouldn't

26:44.840 --> 26:49.240
I wouldn't have attributed all of this momentum or whatever the feeling was I before this

26:49.240 --> 26:53.440
I wouldn't have attributed to Ubuntu necessarily maybe unfairly but now it does kind of feel

26:53.440 --> 26:57.720
like the wind has been sucked from the room or the air you know I mean like it's there's

26:57.720 --> 27:02.680
like a pause here and it's like our big competitive advantage is starting to be taken away. Now

27:02.680 --> 27:06.880
it doesn't and the thing is is it doesn't it doesn't erode our competitive advantage

27:06.880 --> 27:14.200
in hardware or it doesn't erode the advantages that the GPL brings but it it does erode the

27:14.200 --> 27:18.600
one thing that personally I've been invested in a long time which is the desktop. Yeah

27:18.600 --> 27:23.120
I mean that's a lot of what we talk about here on this program even you know it's. And

27:23.120 --> 27:27.600
I mean I and it's just there with Canonical making these changes it just puts this huge

27:27.600 --> 27:30.420
elephant in the room that I feel like I'm ignoring if I don't talk about. Something

27:30.420 --> 27:33.640
you said on a research maybe it was the one of the last I'm not sure but you talk about

27:33.640 --> 27:37.920
how you're like wouldn't really call yourself an evangelist anymore and that's kind of what

27:37.920 --> 27:41.880
strikes me too is it's like no one's saying that Linux isn't a useful tool and it's obviously

27:41.880 --> 27:46.200
still very useful people still want to deploy it on servers look at Azure but yeah there's

27:46.200 --> 27:51.360
less of this like gung-ho we can replace things on the desktop this is the whole stack you

27:51.360 --> 27:55.960
can use now it feels a little bit more like well yeah I mean use it if you use it if you

27:55.960 --> 28:03.100
want to we'll help maybe yeah I'll know a show basically I can I what my what my take

28:03.100 --> 28:07.800
was is I don't consider my I'm not an evangelist anymore I don't go I don't go out and actively

28:07.800 --> 28:14.160
evangelize the platform I do want to see it continue I do like so I I am in some sense

28:14.160 --> 28:17.640
I'm an advocate because I try to I try to promote projects like on these shows and stuff

28:17.640 --> 28:23.600
like that to help them and I contribute financially to projects and I try to be an advocate but

28:23.600 --> 28:26.240
I don't really evangelize as much anymore because it's really getting to the point for

28:26.240 --> 28:31.160
me it's like I don't have a super solid argument I can tell you that it's my preferred working

28:31.160 --> 28:35.120
environment I can tell you that I work the best under it and I find it to be the less

28:35.120 --> 28:41.040
for the least frustrating of the desktop operating systems and I like specifically with a with

28:41.040 --> 28:47.840
a rolling distribution I really like the the fact that for a really long time I was reloading

28:47.840 --> 28:52.680
my machines at least once a year every six months whatever and so since I switched to

28:52.680 --> 28:58.160
Arch on some of my work machines it's it's the installation just lives as long as that

28:58.160 --> 29:04.280
hardware lives yeah and that's really nice because it just means that everything set

29:04.280 --> 29:07.720
up my SSH keys my GPG stuff you don't have to change it you don't have to worry about

29:07.720 --> 29:11.900
it I just sit down and I can work and and and that's nice because it's been like that

29:11.900 --> 29:17.200
now for like three years and it's like wow this is really valuable and I can't really

29:17.200 --> 29:20.600
explain to a Windows user because you're always gonna get the Windows user says well I haven't

29:20.600 --> 29:24.760
had any problems on my install for four years great good for you congratulations didn't

29:24.760 --> 29:29.360
work like that for me and it's about me and so for me these these systems I find them

29:29.360 --> 29:33.880
they stay the performance stays consistent if they generally get just better the desktop

29:33.880 --> 29:37.840
are being stopped environments are just getting better with updates my applications are just

29:37.840 --> 29:42.840
getting better and more competitive especially with you know a lot of the a lot of the latest

29:42.840 --> 29:47.080
us all just on electron anyways I guess what it makes me think is like we're back to philosophy

29:47.080 --> 29:51.560
instead of like before there was some camps right like you can't reproduce production

29:51.560 --> 29:54.560
on your desktop if you don't run a Linux system you know and and there's like various ones

29:54.560 --> 29:58.800
of those were like you just you need a Linux if you want to do this it seems like less

29:58.800 --> 30:02.400
and less of that it's like you can still use Linux for that if you want to use Linux it'll

30:02.400 --> 30:06.520
work great we encourage you to do so but it's now more of like should or you'll feel better

30:06.520 --> 30:11.280
doing it or here's some like philosophical open source type reasons why you might want

30:11.280 --> 30:15.800
to and for some people those just aren't as compelling monkey calm you think the tools

30:15.800 --> 30:22.920
matter yeah I mean over the last five years the tools available to Linux users have just

30:22.920 --> 30:29.080
quadrupled I mean we're running jet brain with Ruby mine and just the mysql tools that

30:29.080 --> 30:35.520
are just they run and they work better and faster and more stable and Linux than Windows

30:35.520 --> 30:39.980
and I have developers are run jet brain and mysql tools and Windows and I have developers

30:39.980 --> 30:44.920
are running Linux and the Linux guys are converting the Windows users to Linux and none of them

30:44.920 --> 30:51.160
run unity they all run either Gnome Mette or KDE yeah and I think canonical sees it

30:51.160 --> 30:57.560
too I mean I think they understand that that that is it excuse me that is exactly the type

30:57.560 --> 31:01.240
of user that is actively looking to switch to Linux right I'm not saying people aren't

31:01.240 --> 31:04.320
switching to Linux I'm trying to build it I'm essentially what I'm building the case

31:04.320 --> 31:08.880
for here is we really just need to forget about the general market and just really kind

31:08.880 --> 31:14.520
of realize realize who's switching it's gonna be people we switch ourselves to Linux or

31:14.520 --> 31:18.560
people like monkey calm that they just outlined or look at canonical right before canonical

31:18.560 --> 31:22.400
made this huge shift what did they do they went on Hacker News start of the thread hey

31:22.400 --> 31:25.720
guys what do you want to see what's Hacker News tell me we want to see Gnome we want

31:25.720 --> 31:29.420
to see Wayland we just want to see basically printing a little better we want to see this

31:29.420 --> 31:34.600
a little better and just ship it all stock so that way think about this and then we'll

31:34.600 --> 31:40.640
move on if I was switching from Mac OS or Windows one of the things I would be exhausted

31:40.640 --> 31:46.040
by at this point is all of the little whims that these companies have had over the years

31:46.040 --> 31:50.780
to sell their operating systems you know Apple's experiment experimented with like Launch Center

31:50.780 --> 31:54.560
and they have a handoff stuff where things popping up on your dock all the time when

31:54.560 --> 31:59.720
you walk into the room and Microsoft has had just this last few years with Windows 8 and

31:59.720 --> 32:03.520
the transition to touch and all of this stuff Cortana everywhere now the integration of

32:03.520 --> 32:08.880
ads and Cortana into the windows and even just like to some of us it's just exhausting

32:08.880 --> 32:14.400
these stupid bullshit names like the the fall creators update and all of these you know

32:14.400 --> 32:18.640
corporate jerky little names that we all just get sick and all of that grades on your nerves

32:18.640 --> 32:22.560
after a while or like today in the telegram group people were talking to somebody was

32:22.560 --> 32:25.600
in there saying I just installed Windows 10 and now I'm spending two hours installing

32:25.600 --> 32:30.060
updates and the way it just trickle feeds you the updates instead of just blasting them

32:30.060 --> 32:34.880
on there like your package manager can these things drive you nuts after a while and you're

32:34.880 --> 32:42.200
going to want to move to something that doesn't have this strategy tax and a pretty stock

32:42.200 --> 32:49.240
gnome setup riding on top of a Debian or Ubuntu or an arch or Fedora is exactly that it's

32:49.240 --> 32:53.760
not somebody's grand vision of the desktop it's not somebody trying to usher in a new

32:53.760 --> 32:59.500
era of computing it's just here's a workstation OS if you don't like this one you can switch

32:59.500 --> 33:04.000
to another one and you can still get your work done yep and that's what people that

33:04.000 --> 33:09.920
are in the know want that's who our target audience is I think that goes right back to

33:09.920 --> 33:12.800
what you were saying before you know just especially like even talking about in India

33:12.800 --> 33:17.000
and China like we still need the desktop those things are still important but like clearly

33:17.000 --> 33:20.680
Ubuntu has started you know decided that they want to focus as an organization on these

33:20.680 --> 33:24.920
on these power users developers creators people who are using this you know in these worlds

33:24.920 --> 33:29.000
and maybe there just isn't that kind of profit and momentum left in the desktop even if it

33:29.000 --> 33:33.720
is still an important part of our mind share hmm all right anybody else in the mummer room

33:33.720 --> 33:37.640
want to chime in before we move on I just thought we'd mention that totally wasn't going

33:37.640 --> 33:42.520
to talk about today because didn't want to seem like a downer but I think it's I feel

33:42.520 --> 33:46.400
like it is the elephant in the room right now it just feels like we gotta we gotta consider

33:46.400 --> 33:50.600
that all of this if you're gonna be trying out bash by any chance or I would love to

33:50.600 --> 33:54.340
hear more about people using that if you're new to that kind of stuff yeah really since

33:54.340 --> 34:00.160
I'm not trying it maybe I should well if you want a positive spin on the whole bash on

34:00.160 --> 34:05.400
Windows they do you always always look at it from the point of view that now people

34:05.400 --> 34:14.160
who are stuck with Windows can run all of the fedora Ubuntu and openSUSE a user space

34:14.160 --> 34:21.280
tools that they want and they could just be using Windows as a shell to get at that stuff

34:21.280 --> 34:26.480
yeah to make them productive well there I'd say the other positive things it does mean

34:26.480 --> 34:31.120
more open source in the hands of more users right which is always good to makes it really

34:31.120 --> 34:37.720
the barrier entries low and when they start using that stuff through WSL eventually will

34:37.720 --> 34:43.480
get to the point that it isn't quite as seamlessly integrated and maybe they'll start moving

34:43.480 --> 34:48.760
over to a proper operating system as a result C sharp you wanted to chime in actually Wimpy

34:48.760 --> 34:54.040
just touched exactly on what I was going to say and just to elaborate more on it I think

34:54.040 --> 34:58.320
it's basically just Windows compromising because it's not Linux and we're seeing stage two

34:58.320 --> 35:02.480
we'll see a stage five and a stage six and then you know we'll have a bunch of Linux

35:02.480 --> 35:08.360
users I could also make the argument I suppose that it's sort of like the same argument why

35:08.360 --> 35:13.440
it's great that we have LibreOffice and Firefox and tools like that on Windows and Gimp and

35:13.440 --> 35:18.260
etc etc etc because then when you switch over to Linux your same exact application sets

35:18.260 --> 35:23.480
available so more maybe that could be even more true I think it's just one of these things

35:23.480 --> 35:28.120
where I'll have to just watch and see where it goes while people are trying it out just

35:28.120 --> 35:32.260
want to mention explain shell.com a few people share that with me this week and it looks

35:32.260 --> 35:36.280
pretty cool you can write down a command line to see how it breaks out so for example say

35:36.280 --> 35:40.640
you're maybe trying out the tar command for the first time well you can put the command

35:40.640 --> 35:47.800
syntax in the explain shell.com box and it breaks down the entire command into really

35:47.800 --> 35:51.560
easy look at that isn't that nice and easy to understand so you can see what each flag

35:51.560 --> 35:57.560
does what the command itself does and it really helps you understand so that is explain shell.com

35:57.560 --> 36:01.360
and then if you're having some trouble with some shell that you've recently written how

36:01.360 --> 36:06.400
about shell check at shellcheck.net which finds bugs in your shell scripts and you can

36:06.400 --> 36:09.120
also install it on the command line if you just want to install it locally yeah it's

36:09.120 --> 36:13.600
like a handy dandy little winter for your bash scripts yeah which I find handy especially

36:13.600 --> 36:17.040
if you like you only write bash scripts occasionally you come back and you're like did I use the

36:17.040 --> 36:20.240
right number of brackets what's happening or you know you just want to maybe sanity

36:20.240 --> 36:24.440
check a one that gets dropped in like a stack exchange thread or something like that I don't

36:24.440 --> 36:30.000
know before you run it on your system yeah yeah yeah so I'm there you go there was therapy

36:30.000 --> 36:34.240
with Chris about I think it's I think you guys are probably right and here's the other

36:34.240 --> 36:39.180
thing even if even if we just say okay maybe these average consumers that we're always

36:39.180 --> 36:43.160
talking about don't really exist for Linux the markets that do seem to be materializing

36:43.160 --> 36:47.920
like the very kind of people that be buying this galago pro that is not only a growing

36:47.920 --> 36:52.320
market but that's a good market to go after there is nothing wrong with that segment that's

36:52.320 --> 36:57.040
a good thing right it really is and there are also people that are more able to tolerate

36:57.040 --> 37:01.120
slightly rough edges or understand what an extension is to a gnome desktop environment

37:01.120 --> 37:04.640
and those might be some of the best users to have in our fold because they might be

37:04.640 --> 37:09.480
able to help fix some of those rough edges too oh man West that's a very good point so

37:09.480 --> 37:13.600
there you go that's the positive take on the whole thing so go ahead Microsoft keep at

37:13.600 --> 37:17.400
it keep at it and while I keep keeping at it if you're at this is what I would do if

37:17.400 --> 37:20.640
you're having problems with your bash scripts you got problems with your shell script you

37:20.640 --> 37:25.020
don't know how to do something Linux Academy is where you go linuxacademy.com slash unplug

37:25.020 --> 37:28.240
sponsor right here of the unplug program and they've been here for a while I think it's

37:28.240 --> 37:31.960
a great service and more and more of you are trying it out all the time you get started

37:31.960 --> 37:38.160
by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged then you sign up for a free seven day trial

37:38.160 --> 37:41.840
try something out now the thing that's great about Linux Academy is they have courseware

37:41.840 --> 37:45.400
for every type of user if you're an experienced Linux user and you're ready to kind of step

37:45.400 --> 37:49.200
it up to the next level on stuff they got courseware for you if you're brand new getting

37:49.200 --> 37:52.840
started with something and maybe it's something that's not even specific to Linux maybe you

37:52.840 --> 37:56.600
want to get your Linux basics or maybe you want to learn how to program in Ruby or a

37:56.600 --> 38:02.800
little Python maybe you could become the next Google linuxacademy.com slash unplugged seven

38:02.800 --> 38:08.560
day free trial here's something else that sets Linux Academy apart they have real instructors

38:08.560 --> 38:14.680
real people can actually help you that's nice because it's not like this is your average

38:14.680 --> 38:20.120
online courseware there's so many online training places where they'll have like a Linux course

38:20.120 --> 38:25.560
or they'll have the Linux plus certification or we'll teach you an AWS course nobody can

38:25.560 --> 38:29.400
match Linux Academy they got great courseware in AWS too and that is its own beast isn't

38:29.400 --> 38:34.280
it isn't isn't that thing a beast and it's so nice to have an authority to go to same

38:34.280 --> 38:39.080
with OpenStack especially with OpenStack's modular nature it's really nice to have a

38:39.080 --> 38:43.480
place you can go where you can wrap your head around complicated topics in just like an

38:43.480 --> 38:50.760
amount of time oh oh okay six hours six hours and I know Ruby I can do that math linuxacademy.com

38:50.760 --> 38:54.720
slash unplugged comprehensive downloadable study guides servers that spin up on demand

38:54.720 --> 38:58.360
when you need them and courseware that matches the distribution you have chosen just try

38:58.360 --> 39:04.480
it all for seven days for free at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thank you to Linux

39:04.480 --> 39:09.600
Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program if they can teach Chris Ruby then I mean anything's

39:09.600 --> 39:13.520
possible that's very true hey how about a little admin and public service stuff for

39:13.520 --> 39:20.080
the community Southeast Linux Fest is t-minus one month away and they're announcing that

39:20.080 --> 39:25.040
the registration is up the schedules released and more so this I wanted to give a little

39:25.040 --> 39:29.320
attention to now it's it's down in Charlotte North Carolina and they have it there at the

39:29.320 --> 39:34.400
hotel it's always actually been a pretty pretty beloved one here by the crew I don't think

39:34.400 --> 39:38.160
I've ever I don't think I've ever gone it's gonna be June 9th through the 11th this year

39:38.160 --> 39:43.720
9th through the 11th of June so it's coming up pretty darn pretty darn soon like you know

39:43.720 --> 39:51.080
a month at the Charlotte Sheraton Charlotte Sheraton say that three times yeah the Charlotte

39:51.080 --> 39:55.000
the the Sheraton Charlotte Airport in Charlotte North Carolina there you go that's the whole

39:55.000 --> 39:59.160
thing so I will say it does seem to like it's one of those things like they have a feels

39:59.160 --> 40:04.080
like they have a similar energy to our dear Linux Fest Northwest you know yeah yeah there's

40:04.080 --> 40:08.560
like they like their cousins yeah very much sister sister conferences yeah so check it

40:08.560 --> 40:15.160
out and they also are on the tweeters if you like to tweet at se Linux Fest at se Linux

40:15.160 --> 40:19.200
Fest if you want to follow them if you're gonna be in the area let me know it'd be

40:19.200 --> 40:23.640
kind of cool that we want it I was thinking field report I'm Noah will probably go I should

40:23.640 --> 40:26.600
ask him but I thought it'd be cool if people go to events like this and they're in our

40:26.600 --> 40:32.920
JB telegram group that'd be a great way to meet up with fellow JB people live people

40:32.920 --> 40:37.040
could post pictures of the of the fest while they're pictures of their beer and make us

40:37.040 --> 40:44.320
all jealous yeah yeah yeah another piece of another piece of admin to cover here on the

40:44.320 --> 40:49.560
show the new Linux unplug subreddit is officially launched look at that handsome devil talking

40:49.560 --> 40:53.680
about it last week and it's happened we've already got people starting to go there and

40:53.680 --> 40:58.440
submit stories thank you to everybody over there so it's a reddit.com slash r slash Linux

40:58.440 --> 41:03.480
unplugged and look at that good stuff in there look at that right there about palazzo put

41:03.480 --> 41:09.120
about the plasma 510 beta that survey we covered is already there wow dude that is nice look

41:09.120 --> 41:13.500
at that story about Edward Snowden talking at the OpenStack summits in there as well

41:13.500 --> 41:18.040
so all kinds of good stuff and the question about the studio I like it I like it thank

41:18.040 --> 41:21.360
you everybody for helping us get the new subreddit set up for this show you can participate at

41:21.360 --> 41:25.480
reddit.com slash r slash Linux unplugged which you know you think about it if you can't join

41:25.480 --> 41:31.440
us live for the for the live virtual lug you could totally hang out with us on the subreddit

41:31.440 --> 41:39.360
yeah that's like 24 7 you don't have to be here at any specific time for that so r slash

41:39.360 --> 41:43.520
Linux unplugged it's kind of long that's what she said but hopefully it'll become a pretty

41:43.520 --> 41:50.200
good community speaking of community holy cow the soundboard I was talking about recently

41:50.200 --> 41:55.040
caster soundboard this thing is full-on nuts now this thing is I'll show it to you here

41:55.040 --> 42:00.240
in a second just a reminder it's a it's a soundboard for podcasters written in c++ and

42:00.240 --> 42:07.080
q5 and since last week I think or since the last time we've talked about it they've they've

42:07.080 --> 42:11.800
they've added the ability to remotely control this thing over the network they've yeah they've

42:11.800 --> 42:18.480
closed 16 features it's now feature complete and in beta that's awesome it supports the

42:18.480 --> 42:22.480
open sound control protocol which I think I'm getting that right I don't even know what

42:22.480 --> 42:25.920
that is but I'm excited there's a bunch of great open source and third-party apps like

42:25.920 --> 42:31.040
available for your phone that you can install and control the soundboard from your phone

42:31.040 --> 42:37.600
right isn't this wonderful you can they added the ability to duck all of the clips at once

42:37.600 --> 42:42.160
they have app-wide ducking you can save an unsaved setups which is one of our original

42:42.160 --> 42:46.820
big requests you can you can have hotkeys to fire off different things and it's been

42:46.820 --> 42:51.240
added to the AUR which is totally totally awesome I think they've also added a jar jar

42:51.240 --> 42:55.520
sub menu I don't know why we have a jar jar bink sub menu but we also I think they're

42:55.520 --> 42:58.200
adding that so I wanted to show it to you so I have it installed if you guys are watching

42:58.200 --> 43:02.640
the video version of the unplugged show I have it installed here if you're not listening

43:02.640 --> 43:07.800
or if you're listening not watching what's up here is a tabbed interface I can have multiple

43:07.800 --> 43:12.160
soundboard tabs and right now I have the Linux unplugged soundboard up and there's a couple

43:12.160 --> 43:16.680
of sliders one is volume and one is position I can set different colors there are all large

43:16.680 --> 43:21.160
touched objects so I don't have it fully maximized but so a picture it's even larger than what

43:21.160 --> 43:25.120
would be on my screen the idea being that it's going to be on a Dell 21 inch touchscreen

43:25.120 --> 43:29.560
so I can fire off all these either with a keyboard or with touchscreen because keyboards

43:29.560 --> 43:34.900
when I'm sitting touch screens when I'm standing and we have of course names you can load files

43:34.900 --> 43:41.560
in here it all it uses the local GTK open file even though it's a cute app look at that

43:41.560 --> 43:46.320
that's super nice it like I was talking about just a just a moment ago it has the remote

43:46.320 --> 43:50.600
control feature so with an open sound control server running on this you can do one way

43:50.600 --> 43:56.800
or two way communication with this soundboard wow yeah which is great because you can have

43:56.800 --> 44:01.560
somebody like yourself you could you know nothing we do in there but imagine like say

44:01.560 --> 44:07.360
you went off to like to like some some conference in Seattle and you came back with some audio

44:07.360 --> 44:10.480
you could be sitting there on your laptop and you could be firing off the clips of the

44:10.480 --> 44:13.680
audio when you were ready for the press I don't it doesn't have to rely on me so in

44:13.680 --> 44:16.960
the past that's awesome I you would have had to give me all the audio before the show I

44:16.960 --> 44:19.700
would have to listen through it all to know when to cue it up and then I would have fired

44:19.700 --> 44:23.000
off but now you could bring the audio in and you could fire it off that's amazing yeah

44:23.000 --> 44:27.080
so that's something we could play with in the future they have the also added the ability

44:27.080 --> 44:32.240
where I can grab the in and out part hi there you do that was good I was in and out yeah

44:32.240 --> 44:35.960
all the same time I can grab the in and out parts of a clip I should do it I should so

44:35.960 --> 44:40.120
I can pull down the volume right here so I do it again see it's quieter now and then

44:40.120 --> 44:45.600
there is a isn't that great we also have app-wide ducking like I was talking about so it brings

44:45.600 --> 44:51.640
everything down by 33 percent which is really cool I can tie I can drag it up a little bit

44:51.640 --> 44:55.800
there so and then of course there is a global stop all clips button which is pretty cool

44:55.800 --> 44:59.640
aka the shut up button yep and then I could just create more sound boards I could call

44:59.640 --> 45:03.760
this one you know something that would be really relevant to the show and I can tab

45:03.760 --> 45:07.200
through the different interfaces and have different boards loaded here save them out

45:07.200 --> 45:12.400
import them out isn't this neat that is so awesome it's all all created by members of

45:12.400 --> 45:17.680
their tool yeah it really is it is now it is beyond what the proprietary applications

45:17.680 --> 45:22.560
on macOS could offer and a few short weeks all created by our community members for the

45:22.560 --> 45:26.480
podcasting community so we have that linked up in the show notes it's sort of it's it's

45:26.480 --> 45:30.960
a bit sorry about that loud noise the chat rooms give me a hard time but it's sort of

45:30.960 --> 45:36.440
the it's sort of the coolest like little community project I've seen us work on in a while so

45:36.440 --> 45:40.360
big thank you everybody on the github that is working you guys are awesome and we should

45:40.360 --> 45:44.840
like I don't know we should like come up with a way to get you guys like beers or something

45:44.840 --> 45:49.680
something yeah wish if I had if I had all of the monies in the world if I had all the

45:49.680 --> 45:52.920
Bitcoin in the world I just fly people out and take them up from here for that I you

45:52.920 --> 45:57.560
know if I could throw one more out there I would love to see if anybody has any interest

45:57.560 --> 46:02.520
in working on another open source project it's an audio visualizer written in Python

46:02.520 --> 46:08.240
it's a little gooey tool that renders visualizations on audio files now if you've ever watched

46:08.240 --> 46:13.800
a video version of user air you've seen this this sucker in in action if you're watching

46:13.800 --> 46:17.640
the video version too I have it I have an example up and essentially it takes an audio

46:17.640 --> 46:24.080
input file and it takes a background image in and then it uses ffmpeg to render out a

46:24.080 --> 46:29.080
video that matches the length of the audio file that has waveforms that match the audio

46:29.080 --> 46:32.320
so that way you can put this up on you could put an audio show up on YouTube or put it

46:32.320 --> 46:36.040
in an mp4 video feed or something like that and there's actually something there's a visualizer

46:36.040 --> 46:40.720
there to look at that matches the vocals now the only problem with this is is it only does

46:40.720 --> 46:45.120
this there's no variation we can do with it we can't put animation like we can't put a

46:45.120 --> 46:49.280
movie file in the background even though ffmpeg of course supports all of this it's just the

46:49.280 --> 46:53.780
rapper does not right and what we'd like to do is be able to have more variety so we could

46:53.780 --> 47:00.460
use it for Linux action news we could use it for user air and then other podcasters

47:00.460 --> 47:03.340
could use it for their podcast and we could all look a little different we could all have

47:03.340 --> 47:07.080
our own unique look to it so that's also going to be in the github that might be asking for

47:07.080 --> 47:11.720
a lot really it's python and ffmpeg so it's it's pretty straightforward pretty awesome

47:11.720 --> 47:16.200
and it's already up on it's already up on github just go pull it down right now and

47:16.200 --> 47:20.440
so we're working on this and one of the one of the pushes for us to do this is we're trying

47:20.440 --> 47:26.200
to decide as a network if we want to be the podcasting network that delivers you get a

47:26.200 --> 47:31.080
show and you get it in any file format any way you want it so if you if you want to get

47:31.080 --> 47:35.980
Linux action dues in a video file and watch it on your Kodi box you can do it if you want

47:35.980 --> 47:42.280
to download an mp3 of Linux action show you or text app you can do it if you want an HD

47:42.280 --> 47:45.960
video version of text app you can get it I want an opus file Chris well that's something

47:45.960 --> 47:50.560
we are actually working on too and so it's going into this thing like what do we want

47:50.560 --> 47:54.920
to be as a podcast or because it's much more feasible for us to say well this is an audio

47:54.920 --> 47:59.000
show so we're just going to officially release an mp3 because then we can get actual tracking

47:59.000 --> 48:03.280
numbers on it we can manage the feed simpler we know where to focus all of the ratings

48:03.280 --> 48:06.100
and the reviews and the different podcast networks which makes a huge difference for

48:06.100 --> 48:10.400
discover ability and it's less hosting for us and it's less time you're kind of more

48:10.400 --> 48:15.240
in line with what a lot of other you know more mainstream podcasts do right in and and

48:15.240 --> 48:19.360
a lot of quote-unquote platforms that are built to host podcasts are dropping support

48:19.360 --> 48:26.620
for og and webm and so they're just essentially supporting mp3 maybe m4a and so we've been

48:26.620 --> 48:29.720
trying to decide well what do we want to do is do we want to just continue to like rebuild

48:29.720 --> 48:33.680
replacement platforms to host these files when these things shut down and pay for the

48:33.680 --> 48:38.080
storage and pay for the time to upload it and encode it for the editor and like what

48:38.080 --> 48:42.480
it or do we just want to focus we and we're trying to decide like we're trying to find

48:42.480 --> 48:47.640
a really good balance here and this this this this open source project is actually the linchpin

48:47.640 --> 48:53.240
to this entire thing because this audio visualizer allows us to put in an audio file put in a

48:53.240 --> 48:56.640
good background which we would like to have more flexibility with and have a little more

48:56.640 --> 49:00.600
flexibility with the visualizer and then we can put out a file that we're actually like

49:00.600 --> 49:04.320
I tried it with Linux action news and nobody liked the video file like ever I thought it

49:04.320 --> 49:07.400
looked okay but everybody's complaining on YouTube that it's giving them seizures so

49:07.400 --> 49:10.580
okay all right we've got to come up with something better but you'd like to have like a first

49:10.580 --> 49:16.040
class audio only yeah supported pipeline it makes it makes it when you produce a show

49:16.040 --> 49:21.120
for audio it makes it so much better I it just it's I don't need to go into it but and

49:21.120 --> 49:24.280
if you make a show for video and you produce it for video it makes a video show that much

49:24.280 --> 49:27.760
better and that's how we're gonna do it but I still think we should probably try to make

49:27.760 --> 49:32.000
everything available when whatever way people want it and this tool is sort of the tool

49:32.000 --> 49:35.840
that I think is gonna allow us to build a production pipeline around that so we would

49:35.840 --> 49:41.900
love the help if you are if you have the interest on the audio visual Python thing yeah so there

49:41.900 --> 49:45.520
you go yeah that's true thank you ww thank you that does make me feel better a little

49:45.520 --> 49:52.000
bit but I love him you know what I love him I just I just love him one other thing I want

49:52.000 --> 49:55.520
to talk about because I think it could be interesting maybe down the road and how things

49:55.520 --> 50:00.000
like this affect Linux users too it's only affecting Android users right now but Netflix

50:00.000 --> 50:06.960
is confirming that it's blocking rooted and unlocked devices which could be pretty significant

50:06.960 --> 50:11.420
down the road for potentially other other types of and I feel like especially for some

50:11.420 --> 50:15.780
of our audience you know we more than a lot of other people perhaps are interested in

50:15.780 --> 50:21.800
having rooted devices or other modifications yeah so I thought that was using this is kind

50:21.800 --> 50:26.360
of something that I've kind of taken for granted that it'll just work yeah yeah they're using

50:26.360 --> 50:30.400
the wild vine or wild vine wide vine wide vine is that what it is Google's yeah they

50:30.400 --> 50:34.120
bought that company yeah yes yeah and it's a DRM technology that basically has like you

50:34.120 --> 50:39.220
can pick your layer layer of security how trusted you want a device to be and Netflix

50:39.220 --> 50:43.960
has chosen the trusted level that disqualifies rooted devices which may be more I could say

50:43.960 --> 50:48.640
that the content partners Netflix works with probably force them to choose probably we

50:48.640 --> 50:53.040
don't know probably yeah so it's an interesting thing with Android and one of the things that

50:53.040 --> 50:57.600
we're gonna be talking about probably more next week is magic device tool which kind

50:57.600 --> 51:00.640
of goes in with all of this so magic device tool we've talked about we've talked about

51:00.640 --> 51:06.320
it before it's pretty straightforward and it's pretty easy to get set up on your machine

51:06.320 --> 51:11.840
you know it is amazingly powerful it allows you to load Ubuntu touch and Ubuntu phone

51:11.840 --> 51:16.280
you know on it like a Nexus 5 I think I might be wrong on that so if anybody like wimpy

51:16.280 --> 51:19.640
or somebody in the mobile room knows correct me but I think I'm like the Nexus 5 you can

51:19.640 --> 51:27.460
load Ubuntu touch Android lineage OS maru OS sailfish OS and Phoenix OS with this one

51:27.460 --> 51:31.880
tool with this one tool so I downloaded it and I have it on my machine upstairs and I

51:31.880 --> 51:36.920
got my Nexus 5 charging up and I think I'm gonna try lineage first oh nice yeah didn't

51:36.920 --> 51:43.480
know what mr. Joe does I think so yeah I think so I and it's the one I hear the most in our

51:43.480 --> 51:49.000
community too in terms of you weren't gonna go for the Ubuntu touch well it just might

51:49.000 --> 51:55.440
make me sad yeah I also have been very much considering maru or maru OS yeah right which

51:55.440 --> 51:59.760
is it's like Android but also Debian XFCE I have I don't know if it'd be helpful but

51:59.760 --> 52:05.280
I have that adapter the oh yeah HDMI out I will try it then yeah if you remember to bring

52:05.280 --> 52:08.520
that I'll go find it so anyways I'm gonna be trying to play around this and if things

52:08.520 --> 52:12.540
work out we may get a chance to chat with the developer of the tool next week if all

52:12.540 --> 52:17.880
things line up Marius who works on this says you might be able to make it next week and

52:17.880 --> 52:22.400
I would be great timing if you guys want to try it out too and join us next week in the

52:22.400 --> 52:26.920
mobile room I have a link to the magic device tool which is also there's a snap for that

52:26.920 --> 52:30.080
although I tried to install it had some problems on arch but if you're using snap on Ubuntu

52:30.080 --> 52:33.600
you're probably that's awesome mm-hmm that makes it so easy yeah and you know what I'm

52:33.600 --> 52:38.240
gonna do once I rock that Nexus 5 once I rock that Nexus 5 with lineage I'm gonna put it

52:38.240 --> 52:42.280
on ting that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna put it on ting you go to linux.ting.com to

52:42.280 --> 52:46.720
save $25 off a ting device or if you bring one you just bring a ting device check their

52:46.720 --> 52:52.000
BYOD page because they support CDMA and GSM if you just bring just bring it over and you'll

52:52.000 --> 52:57.160
get a $25 service credit from ting now here's the killer thing and I was surprised I did

52:57.160 --> 53:03.920
not realize this when I switched to ting average ting bell $23 so they're gonna give you a

53:03.920 --> 53:07.880
$25 service credit it's mobile the way it should be you just pay for what you use and

53:07.880 --> 53:13.340
that's it six dollars for the line and that's your usage on top of that no contracts nationwide

53:13.340 --> 53:21.680
coverage pay for what you use with a really great dashboard check it out just go to linux.ting.com

53:21.680 --> 53:25.480
and they got great devices too so if you want to be if you just want to grab one there you

53:25.480 --> 53:30.000
can do that and if you get a like a Play Store device bring that over there if you get like

53:30.000 --> 53:35.160
one of the Nexus devices or pixel you might take a look at what coverage is better in

53:35.160 --> 53:40.440
your area because you could choose CDMA or ting I mean CDMA or GSM on ting they offer

53:40.440 --> 53:44.040
both so many options you can just pick up a SIM card and then just put it in a device

53:44.040 --> 53:48.880
that you picked up from the Play Store they also you can buy iPhones and motorolas and

53:48.880 --> 53:53.000
all the you know like really nice devices like the high-end stuff and you know like

53:53.000 --> 53:56.680
the stuff that's still pretty good phone but it's in the budget price range and then down

53:56.680 --> 54:02.160
to like the flip phones holy crap holy crap yeah look at this the answer tell one touch

54:02.160 --> 54:07.880
fling which is a flip phone but that could be kind of nice $20 see that's the thing like

54:07.880 --> 54:12.400
$20 six dollars a month for the line yeah even if you break it or you just throw it

54:12.400 --> 54:16.640
on the ground in spite like it doesn't matter wow it's so cheap it's amazing that is really

54:16.640 --> 54:21.600
so game changer let's go over to linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring

54:21.600 --> 54:28.520
the program that is wow wow wow how do they even do that how do they how do they that's

54:28.520 --> 54:32.880
their secret how do they even do it how do they even do it I don't even understand so

54:32.880 --> 54:40.360
mr. West right here in our hot little hands is system 76 is galago pro and this is a pretty

54:40.360 --> 54:46.360
pretty exciting rig a lot of people were drooling all over this thing at Linux fest Northwest

54:46.360 --> 54:50.480
people were constantly stepping by that was the highlight of the system 76 booth yeah

54:50.480 --> 54:53.560
people are stopping by they're constantly to look at this thing and I'm playing with

54:53.560 --> 54:59.200
this ethernet port right like that so I've been I've been messing around with it and

54:59.200 --> 55:02.360
getting a sense for what kind of machine it is and who I think might be really into it

55:02.360 --> 55:06.500
and where I think would fit in with my workflow and I kind of I got like I still have thoughts

55:06.500 --> 55:10.200
in fact I I'm probably gonna still kick it around for a couple of more days I'm gonna

55:10.200 --> 55:14.640
send it back pretty soon because these are in-demand product so I'll just give you the

55:14.640 --> 55:18.800
basics if you're not familiar the galago pro is a 13.3 inch machine that weighs around

55:18.800 --> 55:26.480
like 2.8 2.9 pounds hmm port wise it has them it's really nice in 2017 to get a machine

55:26.480 --> 55:31.320
with these ports it's got one USB C with Thunderbolt and I've been told it has four PCI lanes in

55:31.320 --> 55:37.240
that USB C port yeah which means as each GPU support gets better on Linux you're gonna

55:37.240 --> 55:42.120
get full you would get full eGPU support with four PCI lanes which is really nice like I

55:42.120 --> 55:47.920
said it has Ethernet it has HDMI out it has an SD card slot and DisplayPort now one thing

55:47.920 --> 55:51.360
that might throw you off and this is just my understanding at this time there is also

55:51.360 --> 55:58.520
a here it is there's like a little like a little GSM SIM card slot but I don't think

55:58.520 --> 56:03.800
the corresponding hardware is on the motherboard that's too bad geez excuse me I'm getting

56:03.800 --> 56:10.360
over a cold from Linux test yeah so I don't I might be wrong you might also be able to

56:10.360 --> 56:13.240
pop the bottom off and put something in there so it might not be a huge issue but I think

56:13.240 --> 56:17.360
right now it's just a dead slot it really is a ton of ports though and it's like I'm

56:17.360 --> 56:22.180
just not used to seeing that number on a laptop it's not three it's not four especially especially

56:22.180 --> 56:26.560
one that weighs under three pounds yes so it's this one the one I'm using has a core

56:26.560 --> 56:32.800
i5 or I'm sorry core i7 is 7500 running at about 2.7 or ish they change depending on

56:32.800 --> 56:39.940
what you're doing two physical cores four logical cores Intel HD graphics 620 8 gigabytes

56:39.940 --> 56:48.920
of RAM 256 gigabyte MV and me drive and a 36.2 watt hour battery so that is my test

56:48.920 --> 56:54.040
config of the system 76 Galago Pro I'll tell you too one of the things besides the really

56:54.040 --> 56:59.040
enjoying the ports and the availability of a DisplayPort in HDMI is particularly nice

56:59.040 --> 57:03.760
and the USB C port is nice it does also have a barrel charger it does not charge over USB

57:03.760 --> 57:08.400
C right and I asked this from 76 if they think that might be something future models might

57:08.400 --> 57:13.280
offer and they're looking at that so that may be that would be nice the the barrel connector

57:13.280 --> 57:16.840
is pretty straightforward and the power brick is pretty small it's like that one of the

57:16.840 --> 57:20.200
smallest I've ever seen from system so that's dainty yeah power button here on the side

57:20.200 --> 57:24.800
too mm-hmm which I kind of like it's just an odd spot but it's it's got it one of the

57:24.800 --> 57:27.760
things they discrete one of things they've done is they built a delay into it so that

57:27.760 --> 57:30.680
way if you like bumped it with your mouse or something it doesn't trigger it you have

57:30.680 --> 57:34.760
to hold it for a few seconds which I actually think is a pretty good idea the case is is

57:34.760 --> 57:40.720
pretty nice it's it's particularly nice from system 76 too and one of the things that I

57:40.720 --> 57:45.400
think they've done above and beyond with the Gallego Pro is the way they've done the logo

57:45.400 --> 57:49.560
in and I believe this is probably how they're gonna do it on future products as well it's

57:49.560 --> 57:57.600
a aluminum or metal type casing and the system 76 logo is is is like baked into the housing

57:57.600 --> 58:02.160
yeah you don't feel it at all it's just it looks really good I'd say it's it's pretty

58:02.160 --> 58:07.200
close to the XPS line and build quality I'd say it's on par with most Lenovo's for sure

58:07.200 --> 58:11.960
what do you definitely yeah yeah I mean it feels sturdy there's no bend right in it right

58:11.960 --> 58:14.760
the hinges with the screen which is always something I'm worried about yeah that's rock

58:14.760 --> 58:19.400
solid yeah in my opinion the screen really pops too do you feel like that yeah yeah it's

58:19.400 --> 58:23.720
got it's it's not touch though right correct correct which I think actually a lot of people

58:23.720 --> 58:26.560
might perhaps they're not interested in that a lot of times it takes away from battery

58:26.560 --> 58:32.240
life and other things but it is beautiful and it's high dpi it is it's like it's it's

58:32.240 --> 58:37.480
thirty two hundred by eighteen hundred I think is that right is that the yeah I think so

58:37.480 --> 58:41.880
so yeah that's the so the screen I I've been pretty impressed with that there's a bezel

58:41.880 --> 58:47.240
around it so when compared to the XPS 13 right it jumps out at you but it's not as bad as

58:47.240 --> 58:49.720
most of the other systems like I'd say it's a smaller bezel than you'd have like on the

58:49.720 --> 58:55.480
Apollo and it it all is the housing itself is pretty nice it's well balanced too like

58:55.480 --> 58:59.120
you can have a nice laptop that's weighted really weird and hard to hold and carry around

58:59.120 --> 59:03.680
but this is like it's portable yeah yeah I've had a couple of I've had a couple of complaints

59:03.680 --> 59:08.280
with the fan noise and I think I kind of got from a from a conversation I had with system

59:08.280 --> 59:12.600
seventy six that they're still tweaking the firmware a bit on the cooling like maybe the

59:12.600 --> 59:16.520
fans kick in a little sooner than they need to yeah right so that was that was a potential

59:16.520 --> 59:22.800
issue you know looking at this machine this was probably one of the hardest laptops I've

59:22.800 --> 59:28.480
ever you know I think it was the hardest laptop I've ever reviewed and I'll tell you I couldn't

59:28.480 --> 59:32.300
really wrap my head around why does this feel like it's so so hard for me to review this

59:32.300 --> 59:37.960
laptop and I realized that we are in like a three-year transitionary period that's extremely

59:37.960 --> 59:44.320
awkward we are transitioning well let's start with the one we just been talking about we're

59:44.320 --> 59:49.480
transitioning on the Ubuntu side which system 76 ships we're transitioning to Gnome and

59:49.480 --> 59:53.160
Wayland that's a big transition that's gonna take a few years to work everything out we're

59:53.160 --> 59:57.520
transitioning to high DPI there's still a lot of little nigglies there that need to

59:57.520 --> 01:00:05.680
be worked out we are transitioning from lots of different types of connectors to USB C

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:12.520
and Thunderbolt 3 hardcore making that pivot right like there are all of these are huge

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:19.520
transitions and that machine is a product of that that is on the outer rim it's it's

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:23.680
a machine that is if you're the type of person that likes to buy a computer that is going

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:27.500
to where everyone's eventually going to end up this is that machine so if you want a two

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:33.360
three four year work machine this is going to be that computer where in some sense it

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:38.120
would if you could have everything in the entire world you would probably have more

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:43.800
like a 70 watt hour battery and you would probably have maybe a slightly larger trackpad

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:48.760
and charging over USB C yep but that's just not where this market is at right now we are

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:54.480
in a transitionary period and if you need a good workstation that runs Linux right now

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:58.100
that is lightweight that's easy to say take on a plane and travel with that still has

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:02.280
some pretty great performance I I knocked on this thing quite a bit specifically today

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:06.280
before the show to try to get a sense of like what the battery life is under some significant

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:11.920
work so I not only did I just do like a lot of my general show prep web browsing writing

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.080
up notes on the show but I also ran a few for on expense marks low-level stuff that

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:19.520
just sort of kept the hard drive busy for a little bit did little things here and there

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:24.420
just to keep the machine average busy but not stress it out too much so so I could kind

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:28.660
of get an idea of what the performance of the battery would be like if I have Wi-Fi

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:34.400
on if I have the screen about 50% brightness which is still plenty bright it's plenty bright

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:39.760
at 50% brightness if I put it down to 50% I'm on Wi-Fi and I and I'm just taxing maybe

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:44.800
the disk subsystem for a bit and then the CPU for a bit and then just general browsing

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:51.260
I got about about three hours I think I could have got three hours and 50 minutes out of

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:55.720
it if if I wasn't pushing it quite as much if you weren't you but I wanted to simulate

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:59.960
more of a real workload for me now I am the kind of person that is sufficient battery

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:05.440
for me yeah me too I think I mean like four hours issues like a good target no I'm not

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.720
he's like one of these guys he likes a 12-hour battery yes because he doesn't like to charge

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.720
his battery all day he likes to pretend like it's a tablet yeah even though he has docks

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:19.440
everywhere so I was but I was actually I was more impressed with that than I expected I

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:24.080
did have some issues initially with when I was first charging this thing up under stock

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:29.840
Ubuntu reading the full battery life but then after I installed system 76 is PPA that that

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:33.840
cleared up that pretty much became a non-issue the other thing I was considering too is I

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.240
might be able to push it beyond four hours if I installed TLP oh yeah and configured

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:43.520
that to like some just saying defaults so I contacted system 76 and I said are you considering

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:48.000
shipping this laptop with TLP pre-installed it's not on the radar yet they're considering

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.120
maybe some some tweaks like that but there's nothing like that yet they're gonna be shipping

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:55.600
it with unity still by the way people have been a lot of people been asking me is it

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.460
shipping with gnome and their new theme it is shipping with unity right now so I have

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:05.000
it with the latest Ubuntu stable release with the system 76 PPA on there it is really snappy

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.160
I gotta say yeah playing with it I played some race the Sun and other things and yeah

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:11.580
and the thing is you're playing I mean I know this isn't like the most demanding game but

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:16.680
you're playing race the Sun at 4k resolution on an Intel embedded graphics yes with a nice

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.800
frame rate yeah so I'm gonna do some more gaming on it to just get an idea of where

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.880
its limits are because I'm sure I'll hit them with an Intel graphics but it's nice to know

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:27.860
that the desktop itself performs well and some basic games seem to be performing well

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:33.360
even at high resolution yeah anyways so that's that's that's sort of my initial take on it

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:38.080
so far but I wanted to touch on one more sort of concluding kind of thing that I've liked

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:46.240
a lot about this laptop so for myself there's one thing that I always under sell myself

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:51.280
on and it's it bites me every damn time need that Windows Pro license that's what it is

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:55.960
right that CD key on the bottom that's what you want yeah man it solves so many problems

01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:02.680
no it's the keyboard so many times I have under sold the value of a good keyboard to

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:10.660
myself and it it it the cost is daily frustration when I use my machine like not quite as fast

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:16.960
as I could be or my fingers still never learn the right position and it's it's it's so frustrating

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.920
I always always feel like I can never quite get that balance right on a laptop and I think

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:25.080
some people think system 76 is maybe missed the mark I think they've been better at it

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:28.600
in the last few years this one out of all of the machines I have in the studio right

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:34.120
now I can honestly tell you that this has the most comfortable keyboard now I don't

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:38.000
have like I don't have a mechanical keyboard with brown key switches or whatever there

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.760
I should come on clear clear okay all right okay see see apparently Wes knows I but I

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:47.960
don't so I'm not comparing it to somebody's ultimate keyboard setup I'm comparing it to

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:54.120
a bunch of Logitech keyboards in the studio a MacBook Pro keyboard a Logitech gaming keyboard

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:57.540
that's what I'm doing laptop keyboards are the class of their own right like it does

01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:00.560
have to be portable do you what are you now I've had you that's one of the things I've

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.840
asked you to specifically sort of play around with since you've been in the studio today

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:07.360
what are your thoughts on the keyboard I like it it's comfortable to type with you know

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:11.960
it's not like the deepest ever but it's a key travel is nice and so like for me I have

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:17.080
like a 17 character password for a lot of things like my main go-to password for things

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.680
and on bad keyboards I can kind of tell it when I first got like the mechanical keyboard

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:23.920
I have at home one of the first things I noticed was like I don't make mistakes typing this

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.600
you know I type it like a thousand times every day same thing with this one like I can type

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:30.760
that very reliably I'm not making mistakes and that's really what counts because like

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:36.160
those backspaces are what really kill you yeah yeah that just shaving off those frustrations

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:43.200
is really nice so I was I'm pretty I'm pretty impressed with it I found it to be exactly

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:48.520
what you would want if you were somebody that wants to bust out a daily Ubuntu workhorse

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:53.760
and get some work done and gaming is it's in the back of your mind but you're willing

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:58.080
to sort of consider if I give it a few more months I could probably pick up an external

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:03.040
GPU and when I met my desk I could game like I can't tell you that's gonna work with this

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:08.320
I would love to be able to test that I just don't have an eGPU but I know that system

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:14.240
76 specifically worked to make sure that this was a 4 PCI lane USB-C support and that is

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:19.880
to me that is a very exciting future where you can have a ultra portable two two and

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:24.880
a half to almost three pound laptop that has Ethernet by the way which I think is a real

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:29.220
standout feature of this thing when compared to the XPS one of the things in my notes is

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:34.840
like if you if you need an Ethernet port and I consider myself one of those people this

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:38.520
is this is sort of one of your best bets at this size right so like for Noah that's a

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:43.920
huge deal right so he doesn't want those dongles yeah I have settled with the dongles but I

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:47.240
don't like it and so this would this would donk this would this would be a dongle is

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:50.440
machine for me which I think would be pretty great but anyways if you're somebody that

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:54.320
needs a machine like this this is a pretty good match for that the competition is stiff

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.460
right now but I think they have a pretty solid offering with this I would really like to

01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:03.600
see system 76 stick with this machine over a few releases to keep iterating yeah eventually

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:08.120
you know add in things like USB-C charging maybe actually get that SIM slot oh man a

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:13.120
system 76 laptop with an active LTE SIM that I could pop in there oh that's amazing that

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:16.800
would be the other thing too is like it's a handsome looking machine and I know it sounds

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.680
silly but especially living in Seattle like I'd like to if I'm gonna be repping a Linux

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:24.160
laptop I'd like to not feel like I have look worse than the MacBooks in the cop shop yeah

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:28.240
you're gonna be competitive and that's why I think that logo on the lid is a kind of

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:33.080
an important thing to mention I would tell you I would I would definitely if you could

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:36.560
get your hands on one like at a convention tried it out try it out I'm hoping they work

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.880
out the the firmware on the fan stuff that would be one thing for me that would be a

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:44.080
little little bit of an issue but otherwise I really liked it I really liked it and I

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:49.800
was also consistently surprised at how fast it was and today when I was when I was particularly

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:54.720
trying to push it to kind of see what I could get out of it it's still the unity desktop

01:07:54.720 --> 01:08:00.440
still remained responsive while I was slamming the disk or slamming the CPU like things still

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:06.000
felt like they wasn't like my whole desktop was laying out on me and I think that MVNE

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000
is a big part of probably that performance story right yeah so check it out if you guys

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.560
are curious you can find it over at System76 lots of reviews are coming online right now

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:18.280
too I think people I think I saw somebody too is getting is receiving theirs or something

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:25.120
like it's it's beginning to happen it's happening Wes it's happening speaking of happening may

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:14.600
so we have to go kind of soon because the text that program is recording another show

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:18.640
but I did want to give the mumble room a chance to ask any questions in the chat room if anybody

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:23.480
wanted to ask any questions about the Galago while I have it here in my little hands go

01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:29.840
ahead anybody go on I'll go on twice are you a regular user of the touchpad on that thing

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:34.000
or do you use a mouse I've been using the touchpad the whole time I have not actually

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.560
hooked up to a mouse how do you feel about that compared to say the MacBook or the XPS

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:42.280
13 well I think it's comparable to the XPS 13 I feel like the new MacBook is it's sort

01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:46.820
of that's a challenging thing to compare it to because it's so huge huge yeah trackpad

01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:51.360
on the MacBook is crazy nice yeah I would like to see the trackpad be larger I tried

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:54.880
the Galago Ultra Pro at scale but it was before they had the final keyboard and it

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:58.880
might have been before they had the final trackpad I would say I would so I was not

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:03.440
impressed but I don't really have a lot of complaints the buttons aren't like super clicky

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.200
to me but they're fine it's got dedicated buttons the touchpad itself the feel and the

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:11.680
fact that the mouse didn't seem to move smoothly it's a little smooth for me you know like

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:16.160
the feel of it I will also say I do like that it's small I guess like I like that the Mac

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:21.040
one's big but Linux drivers have never been as good at the like you when you hit it with

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:25.920
your thumb or I kind of small hands so it's like a giant touchpad hard for me so I kind

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:29.840
of appreciate that this one's not huge yeah yeah chat room some people in chat room say

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.760
the battery life isn't for them and that's just a decision you have to make for me two

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:37.240
three hours when I'm working on it pretty hard is decent I blame some of that on Linux

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:41.800
too I mean if you put Windows 10 on here maybe you get six hours I don't know it's possible

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:44.560
maybe not either you're not gonna try that you're not gonna put Windows on the machine

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:49.900
born to run Linux I did run Arch on it for quite a bit I ran Arch and I actually am planning

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:55.240
to put elementary on here in a bit too yeah elementary and that would be a handsome combination

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.720
yes what I was thinking any other questions everybody else got any other questions before

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:04.120
we move on I don't know with William I really like the keyboard on this yeah what's the

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:11.440
RAM on that this one you can go up higher so this 32 I think yeah the the review unit

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:17.360
that I have has eight gigs of delicious tasty tasty RAM on it I also was considering although

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.520
I don't have a lot of time with this unit I have to send it back I was considering popping

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.760
off the bottom and seeing what the upgrade possibilities are you should post some of

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:29.480
those pics on Twitter actually add the LTE modem yourself yeah it sounds like it's not

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:32.960
in the skews they sell but I wonder if it's still on the board because it is you know

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:39.200
a clevo unit or something originally I wonder I wonder I don't know since it has VMs just

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:45.400
since it has 32 gigs do you see yourself running any VMs on it so this has a 256 gig hard drive

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:49.160
but you could obviously put a larger hard drive in it if you wanted to because yeah

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:55.360
you can get up you can get up to one terabyte MVM NVME if you wanted to actually they offer

01:11:55.360 --> 01:12:01.480
up to two terabytes on the system 76 website two terabytes of MVM storage would be that's

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:06.080
another part about this this nice it's like a very configurable laptop yeah that yeah

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:10.540
you can put a dish you can put an additional disk in this compared to like like Dell's

01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:13.240
website where you have to there's like six different ways you can try to configure an

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:19.720
XPS 13 and none of them have the same options you can put so you could put a if you wanted

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:28.080
to you could put a 250 gig NVME drive as your OS drive and then you could put a one terabyte

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:35.000
2.5 SSD in the second drive bay now you're editing video man well you are definitely

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.080
getting VMs definitely that's your steam partition right there yeah yeah I would say for like

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:44.600
that oh yeah it's got two DIMMs that's nice yeah you can get full 32 yeah you can get

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:49.080
full yep yep I would say for that so if I was gonna build this for myself if I was gonna

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:54.200
go nuts I would go with 1704 Ubuntu I would probably leave it at 3.1 gigahertz I don't

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:59.440
need to blow that money I would probably get 32 gigs of RAM I would get a 250 gig OS drive

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:04.800
I get a one terabyte SSD I would probably get the nicer Wi-Fi just throw that laptop

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:10.720
back in there you need a new bag Chris so my total wow this is pretty reasonable my

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:16.560
total for a pretty nicely specced 13-inch laptop with a 4k screen is 1800 bucks that's

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:21.280
under 2k that is actually really reasonable 1900 you know probably if you know after there's

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:25.720
some taxes or shipping or something I don't know but yeah that's really I mean compared

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:29.640
to the like I mean I'm comparing to a MacBook there but well even on some of the like higher

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.800
end XPS 15 or something like you're easily in that territory yeah yeah so you really

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:38.720
what you have to decide is are you ready to switch to 4k on Linux that's one of the things

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.280
you have to consider when you get the Galago Pro some of the things you don't think about

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:46.960
there is like grub screens other things are kind of a pain sometimes yeah Java apps even

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.840
steam on that like really yeah super small there is I've linked to it a few weeks back

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:54.720
there is like a steam theme that helps with high DPI it just makes fonts a little bigger

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.320
so you got to make that you got to make that call are you willing to be on a little bit

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.160
of a bleeding edge and then understand too that we're about to go through the Wayland

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:04.960
transition as well which probably should be fine for high DPI but just something to be

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:10.680
considered of and if you are and you want a workhorse that's Heidi this at a laptop

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:14.960
this is this could be a great one because it's fast enough to get work done and it's

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.880
small enough to travel with you and light enough that you'll actually put in your bag

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.220
that's pretty nice so they got a good mix there and I'd be curious to see if they stick

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:28.360
with it where it goes especially when they start building these there you go ww you had

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:36.400
a note go ahead oh no bashful was asking in chat and I don't think you got it he was wondering

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.200
what was the heat output on it is it running too hot when you're using you know I wanted

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:44.280
to ask that as well it's really not bad although I think part of that is the fan does seem

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:47.000
to kick in a little sooner than it should and it does have I mean it does have good

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.840
ventilation on the bottom it looks like yeah it really does it hold out this whole bottom

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:55.760
piece is then this whole piece where like the motherboarded motherboard is is vented

01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:01.560
and they have do have a fan there so I think I mean I would say I would say it probably

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:04.980
has room to get warmer before the fan kicks and I think that's what they're playing with

01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:10.720
right now yeah if I could keep it for a little bit longer I would try a few different production

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:14.000
things on it I would try editing doing some encoding on it just to give you that take

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.040
two but in the meantime kind of give you an idea of where it's at yeah well hopefully

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:22.200
if anyone out there buys one they'll let us know what they think of it too yeah we really

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:26.320
it does seem like there's some pretty good interest here oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
