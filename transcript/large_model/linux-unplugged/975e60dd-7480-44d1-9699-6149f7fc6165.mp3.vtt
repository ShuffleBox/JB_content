WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:02.960
Wes found something that might change my life

00:02.960 --> 00:04.320
for this week's episode.

00:04.320 --> 00:05.320
Game changer.

00:05.320 --> 00:07.760
The peak of the show, right here,

00:07.760 --> 00:11.800
is a Raspberry Pi-powered grocery bot.

00:11.800 --> 00:14.420
You take it with you, it's like a Raspberry Pi companion.

00:14.420 --> 00:16.120
It's built into a case, it has a handle,

00:16.120 --> 00:17.880
it has a mustache, it has a camera.

00:17.880 --> 00:19.040
What a mustache.

00:19.040 --> 00:20.600
It is a great mustache, actually.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.240
Why don't more Raspberry Pi cases have mustaches?

00:23.240 --> 00:24.760
And anyways, get this thing.

00:24.760 --> 00:27.560
It's basically got like one of those little barcode scanners

00:27.560 --> 00:31.680
and a buzzer, and it helps you keep track of the groceries

00:31.680 --> 00:33.400
that you need and have picked up.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.920
And you just take it with you and scan the barcodes,

00:36.920 --> 00:38.500
and you can add them to your grocery list,

00:38.500 --> 00:40.620
and then you can get the report on your mobile device

00:40.620 --> 00:41.960
when you're at the grocery store.

00:41.960 --> 00:44.080
So you have this thing in your kitchen,

00:44.080 --> 00:45.680
you pull, oh, I'm out of milk,

00:45.680 --> 00:47.900
and you scan the barcode, it adds it to your list,

00:47.900 --> 00:50.560
and then the next time you're at the grocery store,

00:50.560 --> 00:54.920
you have all the items, the exact item, the specific item.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.360
Buy a barcode, I mean, yeah, right?

00:56.360 --> 00:57.200
How great is this?

00:57.200 --> 00:58.160
It seems really nice.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.680
Because take it to the next level.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.840
Imagine that Beard here, right?

01:01.840 --> 01:04.060
Beard gets online deliveries all the time.

01:04.060 --> 01:05.280
I've done it a little bit myself

01:05.280 --> 01:07.720
with our local Safeway grocery store, it's great.

01:07.720 --> 01:09.560
It's so the way to go, yeah?

01:09.560 --> 01:10.400
Yeah.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.960
And imagine now taking that to the next level

01:11.960 --> 01:13.840
where you could have this thing next to the fridge,

01:13.840 --> 01:15.960
and you scan the barcode, it adds it to a list,

01:15.960 --> 01:17.640
and then when you're done, you just hit send,

01:17.640 --> 01:20.820
it sends the whole list off to the grocery delivery service,

01:20.820 --> 01:21.960
and in a couple of days,

01:21.960 --> 01:24.360
a whole new batch of grocery shows up at your door.

01:24.360 --> 01:26.040
You would totally use this, come on.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.400
I would, the thing I would like to see more

01:28.400 --> 01:33.160
is AI integration to suggest new groceries to me.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.240
Oh, like based on your grocery profile.

01:36.240 --> 01:37.080
Yeah.

01:37.080 --> 01:38.680
Ha ha ha.

01:38.680 --> 01:42.000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 225

01:42.000 --> 01:44.840
for November 28th, 2017.

01:44.840 --> 01:57.120
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged,

01:57.120 --> 01:59.840
your weekly Linux talk show that honestly,

01:59.840 --> 02:01.400
a little meat drunk this week.

02:01.400 --> 02:02.280
My name is Chris.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.120
My name is Wes.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.980
Hello, Wes, and Wes, as luck would have it,

02:05.980 --> 02:06.820
the beard's here too.

02:06.820 --> 02:07.760
Hello, beard.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.280
Happy half birthday to me.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.120
Okay.

02:10.120 --> 02:10.960
Indeed, dude.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.360
That's random, that's random,

02:12.360 --> 02:13.680
but it's gonna be, you know what?

02:13.680 --> 02:15.720
A day of celebration here on the Unplugged program.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.040
That's right.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.520
He looks good for his half age too.

02:18.520 --> 02:19.640
He does, doesn't he?

02:19.640 --> 02:23.160
Nominally this week, we're gonna talk about DRM,

02:23.160 --> 02:25.040
about sort of the historical impact

02:25.040 --> 02:26.420
I think it's gonna have,

02:26.420 --> 02:28.840
and how Linux users could take a small

02:28.840 --> 02:33.840
but important step today to make a change.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.400
We'll talk about that later on in the show,

02:35.400 --> 02:38.600
but before then, we got some news.

02:38.600 --> 02:41.560
We got some community news we're gonna get into,

02:41.560 --> 02:42.640
and we've got a Gentoo challenge.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.920
How's it going over there, by the way, Wes?

02:43.920 --> 02:45.440
Are you getting the virtual machine fired up?

02:45.440 --> 02:46.360
Yes, I am.

02:46.360 --> 02:49.360
So as the show progresses, Wes will be installing Gentoo

02:49.360 --> 02:50.640
from a stage three install.

02:50.640 --> 02:51.480
That's right.

02:51.480 --> 02:52.960
Getting a base system running,

02:52.960 --> 02:54.440
and then throughout the future weeks

02:54.440 --> 02:56.920
of the Unplugged program, each episode,

02:56.920 --> 02:59.060
another piece of the Gentoo puzzle will be clicked

02:59.060 --> 03:01.960
into place, and we'll see how many episodes it takes

03:01.960 --> 03:04.920
to get Wes Payne to a fully functional Gentoo system.

03:04.920 --> 03:05.760
I'm excited.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.940
So starting off right now with episode one.

03:07.940 --> 03:11.040
So 2.25 marks episode one of the Gentoo challenge.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.720
Right now, right here.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.280
We're gonna need to get a jingle for this.

03:14.280 --> 03:15.960
We're gonna need a Gentoo challenge jingle.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.800
So if you have any ideas, send us one.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.400
And we're gonna, in the background,

03:20.400 --> 03:22.120
we'll be doing that as we go through the news,

03:22.120 --> 03:23.720
and we'll check in with you towards the end of the show

03:23.720 --> 03:24.960
and just see how far you got, okay?

03:24.960 --> 03:25.800
Are you good with that?

03:25.800 --> 03:26.640
You feel kumskies?

03:26.640 --> 03:27.460
You kumskies with that?

03:27.460 --> 03:28.820
I'm totally kumskies.

03:28.820 --> 03:30.360
All right, well then before we go any further,

03:30.360 --> 03:31.500
then you know what we gotta do.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.020
We gotta bring in that virtual lug.

03:33.020 --> 03:35.760
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

03:35.760 --> 03:36.600
Hello.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.920
Hello, hey.

03:37.920 --> 03:39.600
Oh, oh, hello.

03:39.600 --> 03:40.660
Oh, hello, everybody.

03:40.660 --> 03:41.640
It is good to see you.

03:41.640 --> 03:42.880
Thank you for being here.

03:42.880 --> 03:46.160
Now, we got so much to talk about this week.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.480
There's a big story.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.900
It's one of these licensing stories

03:48.900 --> 03:50.760
that makes like a lot of headlines

03:50.760 --> 03:52.440
and a lot of people glaze over when it comes out,

03:52.440 --> 03:54.500
but I think it's definitely worth talking about.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.400
Today, breaking news, ladies and gentlemen.

03:57.400 --> 04:00.860
This is CNN Breaking News.

04:02.360 --> 04:05.560
Press release from Red Hat over at redhat.com.

04:05.560 --> 04:09.880
Facebook and Google, IBM, and Red Hat

04:09.880 --> 04:13.680
have committed to providing a clause

04:13.680 --> 04:16.000
to their GPL2 software that they ship.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.320
And this clause has some familiar elements to it.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.220
You may have heard us recently discuss

04:22.220 --> 04:24.880
the Software Conservancy's agreement they got

04:24.880 --> 04:28.240
with about 200 Linux kernel copyright holders

04:28.240 --> 04:31.560
to try to work out with companies.

04:31.560 --> 04:32.400
Yeah, right.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.240
Smooth things out before you sue them.

04:36.520 --> 04:38.440
We'll try all other avenues before we sue.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.600
It was essentially this agreement

04:40.600 --> 04:44.040
that took some clauses from the GPL3

04:44.040 --> 04:45.920
and applied them in a signing statement

04:45.920 --> 04:47.000
to the GPL2 software.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.480
Well, now Red Hat and Facebook and Googs

04:51.480 --> 04:53.600
and IBM have taken it a step further.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.420
Red Hat writes on their blog,

04:56.420 --> 04:58.500
this is gonna provide greater predictability

04:58.500 --> 05:00.040
to users of open-source software.

05:00.040 --> 05:01.760
Red Hat, Facebook, Google, and IBM today

05:01.760 --> 05:04.380
each committed to extending the GPL3 approach

05:04.380 --> 05:09.380
for licensing compliance errors to the software code

05:10.620 --> 05:12.580
that each license under the GPL version two

05:12.580 --> 05:16.080
and GPL, LGPL version two and version 2.1.

05:17.820 --> 05:19.980
They're calling it a common cure rights commitment.

05:19.980 --> 05:20.860
Boy, that's thick.

05:20.860 --> 05:22.880
But what it essentially says is,

05:22.880 --> 05:24.600
we'll try everything else first.

05:25.940 --> 05:26.900
We'll work with you.

05:26.900 --> 05:31.900
And Karen Sandler, she runs the Software Conservancy,

05:32.800 --> 05:35.120
she was quoted in an article from the Register

05:35.120 --> 05:38.760
that says, yeah, she's really thrilled

05:38.760 --> 05:39.880
that companies are doing this,

05:39.880 --> 05:41.440
that they're willing to take on dialogue

05:41.440 --> 05:42.800
and upping their commitment to enforcement

05:42.800 --> 05:45.360
in a way that is gonna actually work long-term.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.440
And in the article from the Register,

05:47.440 --> 05:49.440
they quote Red Hat, saying, Red Hat explained

05:49.440 --> 05:52.640
that legal proceedings generally produce poor results

05:52.640 --> 05:54.520
in the free software and open-source community.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.760
And that litigation should always be avoided.

06:02.080 --> 06:07.080
Why I like this story is because it's a victory

06:08.280 --> 06:11.160
for the nerds, it's a victory for the engineers,

06:11.160 --> 06:13.560
it's a victory for the people who create things

06:13.560 --> 06:15.240
and make things and write software,

06:15.240 --> 06:17.560
it's a victory for the kernel developers,

06:17.560 --> 06:19.320
because this is their preference.

06:19.320 --> 06:21.680
I'm not here to tell you which approach is right.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.600
I'm here to tell you that the kernel developers,

06:24.600 --> 06:27.200
they seem to appear to prefer this approach,

06:27.200 --> 06:30.320
and that's good enough for me, good enough for me.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.440
They wanna work with these companies first

06:33.440 --> 06:35.600
before you try to sue them, because when you sue them,

06:35.600 --> 06:39.000
they react badly, they retract from their involvement

06:39.000 --> 06:42.280
in open-source, and they make shit worse for everybody.

06:42.280 --> 06:43.760
Yeah, right, getting the lawyers involved

06:43.760 --> 06:45.280
doesn't make new things happen

06:45.280 --> 06:48.200
or improve anyone's experience or the software at all,

06:48.200 --> 06:49.600
it just makes it worse.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.920
You're in the legal system.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.280
I felt this way for years.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.400
When we had Greg KH on the Linux Action Show,

06:55.400 --> 06:58.080
and this is something that he and I personally talked about,

06:58.080 --> 06:59.320
it wasn't necessarily in the interview,

06:59.320 --> 07:00.840
but it was something that he and I talked about off air,

07:00.840 --> 07:05.280
was that these discussions take years and years and years,

07:05.280 --> 07:10.280
but generally result in a internal advocacy

07:10.760 --> 07:12.840
for respecting open-source licenses,

07:12.840 --> 07:17.160
and that sort of blossoms into a change of culture

07:17.160 --> 07:19.360
for a company and how they interact with open-source.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.840
They interact with open-source projects,

07:20.840 --> 07:22.160
and when you sue them,

07:22.160 --> 07:24.400
what happens is you smack them in the face,

07:24.400 --> 07:26.040
they retract from their involvement in open-source

07:26.040 --> 07:28.560
because all of a sudden it becomes a business risk,

07:29.440 --> 07:30.560
and you shut them down.

07:30.560 --> 07:31.960
You poison the water.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.200
Say it again? You poison the water.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.800
You poison the water.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.720
And the thing is, I don't really have a dog in this hunt,

07:38.720 --> 07:40.920
but I know that the people that are writing the software do,

07:40.920 --> 07:42.600
and this is the preference they have,

07:42.600 --> 07:45.960
so it's really, really great to see Google and Facebook

07:45.960 --> 07:49.160
and IBM and Red Hat all kind of go this way.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.960
And the elephant in the room is,

07:51.960 --> 07:56.600
well, what about this whole software freedom law center

07:56.600 --> 07:59.680
versus the software conservancy lawsuit that's going on,

07:59.680 --> 08:02.560
which a lot of people thought was sort of brought on

08:02.560 --> 08:04.120
after this big agreement?

08:04.120 --> 08:05.720
I don't know. I don't know.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.200
But I think this is a really great move.

08:08.200 --> 08:12.840
Also, unrelated, fuck the register.

08:12.840 --> 08:17.040
This is a ridiculous stock image

08:17.040 --> 08:18.400
that they have used for this post.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.120
It's some attractive girl staring at her clock,

08:21.120 --> 08:24.080
making some stupid face that you'd make for Instagram,

08:24.080 --> 08:28.440
and they've slapped it on a story about GPL license laws

08:28.440 --> 08:31.640
where they're quoting Karen and they're quoting other...

08:31.640 --> 08:33.080
When you look at the Twitter preview,

08:33.080 --> 08:34.280
it looks like this is a stock image.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.280
This is supposed to be an image of Karen Sandler,

08:36.280 --> 08:38.920
which it's not, and this is a weird image.

08:38.920 --> 08:41.080
It's just inappropriate.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.920
The register recently has been really pissing me off

08:43.920 --> 08:50.360
with inaccurate coverage, and then now this. I don't like it.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.720
I don't like it. I know they're trying to get clicks,

08:51.720 --> 08:54.720
but do a better job. Do a better job.

08:55.640 --> 08:58.400
Anyways, I think this is, plenty enough,

08:58.400 --> 09:00.160
actually looking at the Twitter feed for Karen Sandler,

09:00.160 --> 09:01.960
somebody pointed out what a bizarre stock photo

09:01.960 --> 09:03.360
that the register used.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.760
Because when you look at the preview on Twitter,

09:06.600 --> 09:08.560
it totally looks like that's supposed to be Karen Sandler

09:08.560 --> 09:10.520
because it's coming from the Software Freedom Conservancy

09:10.520 --> 09:11.960
Center, and they're talking about Karen

09:11.960 --> 09:13.600
getting quoted in the article,

09:13.600 --> 09:15.400
and then there's this picture of the stock girl

09:15.400 --> 09:20.280
who is wearing glasses that don't even have lenses in them

09:20.280 --> 09:22.880
and is staring at a watch that's too big for her wrist.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.080
It's just a really obnoxious photo.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.800
Anyways, it's good to see Red Hat

09:26.800 --> 09:28.040
and all those companies work together,

09:28.040 --> 09:31.160
and I bet the real story here is how that happened.

09:32.880 --> 09:35.880
How did those companies wind up in a room together to do this?

09:37.920 --> 09:43.280
And what was the thing that started the conversation?

09:43.280 --> 09:47.560
What was the seed to get Facebook and IBM and Google?

09:47.560 --> 09:49.200
See, that's the thing.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.000
They're big people with their own agendas.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.040
Like if it was, yeah, if it's Twitter and Facebook

09:54.040 --> 09:57.000
or Microsoft and Facebook, but Google and Facebook,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.440
yeah, there's something bigger going on here.

10:00.440 --> 10:02.640
There's a bigger story here that we,

10:02.640 --> 10:04.840
the peeps, don't get to know about.

10:04.840 --> 10:08.360
And hopefully it speaks well to their desire

10:08.360 --> 10:10.800
to continue good relationships with the open source community,

10:10.800 --> 10:14.320
both using and contributing back.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.520
Yeah. Yeah.

10:16.520 --> 10:19.520
I kind of am sick of the licensing stuff,

10:19.520 --> 10:21.480
to be honest with you. I couldn't...

10:21.480 --> 10:23.160
It's important, but it's like, at the end of the day,

10:23.160 --> 10:24.320
that's not what we get excited about, right?

10:24.320 --> 10:25.800
We want to get excited about the software.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.160
It's like exercise. Like I know I need to do it,

10:28.160 --> 10:29.400
and so I have to push through it.

10:29.400 --> 10:32.040
All right, fine, I'll go for a fucking walk.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.400
But I got to tell you, I don't really have any interest

10:33.400 --> 10:36.440
in doing it. Like this licensing stuff,

10:36.440 --> 10:41.440
there needs to be a Groklaw of 2018 that is concise

10:42.720 --> 10:44.560
and needs to tell us why this stuff matters.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.800
So that way I can quote them,

10:45.800 --> 10:47.440
so that way I don't have to read through all this shit

10:47.440 --> 10:48.400
and then tell you guys about it.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.960
Because it's just like slogging.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.920
I know, first world problem, right?

10:52.920 --> 10:54.400
Speaking of first world problem,

10:54.400 --> 10:56.800
how do you finance your open source project?

10:56.800 --> 10:58.360
How do you make money doing open source?

10:58.360 --> 11:00.560
How can you do open source full time?

11:00.560 --> 11:02.480
Well, we found a guide this week.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.160
Did you find this or did I find this?

11:04.160 --> 11:05.200
I'm not sure.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.040
I don't remember either.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.040
I think they have both stumbled upon it.

11:07.040 --> 11:07.880
Maybe, maybe.

11:07.880 --> 11:11.160
This is a handy financial guide for open source projects

11:11.160 --> 11:12.640
and it's up on GitHub.

11:12.640 --> 11:16.240
And in the pre-show, I was talking with Dan

11:16.240 --> 11:19.420
from Elementary OS, and I was telling Dan

11:19.420 --> 11:21.720
that one of the things that I actually really respect

11:21.720 --> 11:23.840
about Elementary OS is that they're brave enough

11:23.840 --> 11:25.920
to ask for money for their hard work.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.760
And I think initially people push back.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.280
I was like, well, what is Elementary OS doing?

11:29.280 --> 11:30.120
What are they doing?

11:30.120 --> 11:31.480
They're just an Ubuntu re-spin.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.640
Obviously misunderstanding all of the hard work

11:33.640 --> 11:35.440
that goes into it, but the people that get it

11:35.440 --> 11:37.800
wanna pay, they wanna support something like this.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.120
But how do you ask for money?

11:40.120 --> 11:42.720
How do you do that in a way that isn't offensive

11:43.900 --> 11:45.700
and in a way that doesn't seem unreasonable

11:45.700 --> 11:48.480
for something that is free by its very license?

11:48.480 --> 11:51.000
And so this is a massive guide.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.240
This is actually legitimately worth your time.

11:53.240 --> 11:57.560
And it breaks us down into 16 different areas.

11:57.560 --> 11:59.200
16 different areas.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.280
Number one would be you can just take a donation button

12:01.280 --> 12:02.420
and you're gonna get the pros and cons

12:02.420 --> 12:03.460
about each one of these.

12:03.460 --> 12:04.720
You can have bounties.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.360
You can have crowdfunding one time.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.280
You can have crowdfunding reoccurring.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.120
You can have merch, books, advertising, sponsorships.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.760
You can get hired by a company to work on a project.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.400
You can start a project while you're currently employed.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.760
You can have grants, consulting services,

12:16.760 --> 12:18.240
software as a service, freemium licenses,

12:18.240 --> 12:21.840
dual licenses, open core foundations, maybe VC.

12:21.840 --> 12:22.680
There's a lot of options.

12:22.680 --> 12:26.000
Yeah, and it shows you examples of all of them too.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.720
So Dan, I know you just had like five minutes

12:28.720 --> 12:31.800
with the article, but did anything jump out at you?

12:31.800 --> 12:33.680
Any warning signs or do you think this is maybe

12:33.680 --> 12:35.880
a solid guide to point people at?

12:35.880 --> 12:38.240
No, I've been poking through it while you guys

12:38.240 --> 12:39.760
have been doing all the rest of the show

12:39.760 --> 12:41.520
and it's really comprehensive.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.960
She does a really good job going through

12:42.960 --> 12:46.200
and saying hey, this is what's good about this,

12:46.200 --> 12:48.880
but this is also what's bad about going this route

12:48.880 --> 12:50.480
and gives a lot of alternatives.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.200
You get a sense of a lot of research.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.720
I mean a lot of research when it's like

12:54.720 --> 12:55.960
she must have gone out there and surveyed

12:55.960 --> 12:58.760
a lot of open source projects and seen how they're doing.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.400
Yeah, absolutely.

13:00.400 --> 13:05.400
But I think one of the things that is kind of glossed over,

13:06.560 --> 13:08.840
I guess, but that I would definitely recommend

13:08.840 --> 13:10.600
for anybody thinking about how to fund

13:10.600 --> 13:14.360
their open source product is to try as many as they can,

13:14.360 --> 13:17.040
as long as it doesn't go against your project goals.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.960
Because she does talk about with advertising and stuff,

13:19.960 --> 13:22.960
maybe that conflicts with your project stances

13:22.960 --> 13:25.080
on how they feel about whatever.

13:25.080 --> 13:28.720
But just try a lot of different things and see what sticks.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.940
Dan, what do you think about this advice

13:29.940 --> 13:32.880
for an open source project is think of your,

13:32.880 --> 13:36.800
asking for contributions not from random strangers,

13:36.800 --> 13:39.040
but from community members you've engaged with.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.240
Which means you're gonna have to up

13:40.240 --> 13:41.220
your community engagement,

13:41.220 --> 13:42.720
you're gonna have to up your community game,

13:42.720 --> 13:45.840
but you're not asking for the drive-by donators.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.720
What you're asking for is people that have

13:47.720 --> 13:49.960
engaged with the project, that become fans,

13:49.960 --> 13:52.720
they're advocates of the project,

13:52.720 --> 13:55.460
they use it themselves, they find importance with it.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.620
Those are really the people you want donations from

13:57.620 --> 13:59.120
because those are the ones that are gonna be motivated

13:59.120 --> 14:01.520
to keep the project alive, right?

14:01.520 --> 14:02.640
Yeah, I mean, I think that's the big,

14:02.640 --> 14:04.820
you're gonna get your recurring stuff from them, right?

14:04.820 --> 14:08.400
So your merchandising or if you're on Patreon

14:08.400 --> 14:10.320
or anything like that, those are definitely the people

14:10.320 --> 14:13.200
that you wanna look at for things like that.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.800
I can tell you though that our number one

14:16.800 --> 14:19.120
method of revenue right now is the pay what you want

14:19.120 --> 14:20.120
on our website.

14:20.120 --> 14:23.880
And it's a lot more than what we get from Patreon.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.480
Really, more than Patreon?

14:25.480 --> 14:27.600
Even though Patreon's reoccurring.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.400
Now, that must be cyclical though.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.480
And that must be tied to release cycles because-

14:32.480 --> 14:33.720
Yes, absolutely.

14:33.720 --> 14:37.320
Yeah, which when you do that, now you have to predict,

14:37.320 --> 14:40.840
you know, what does that money actually mean per month?

14:40.840 --> 14:42.320
Doesn't that make staffing significantly harder?

14:42.320 --> 14:45.320
Like there's so many like hard things to predict

14:45.320 --> 14:49.120
because you don't know if say the elementary OS released

14:49.120 --> 14:51.560
based on 1804 is gonna be a huge hit or not.

14:51.560 --> 14:54.380
Maybe all the attention will be on stock Ubuntu.

14:54.380 --> 14:57.600
Yeah, so in that way, you kind of have to, you know,

14:57.600 --> 14:59.480
look at, you know, what past releases did

14:59.480 --> 15:01.000
and you can only guess, you know,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.060
based on what information you already have.

15:03.060 --> 15:06.640
So if you haven't been fundraising for a few years already,

15:06.640 --> 15:09.440
you don't really have a base to go off of, you know,

15:09.440 --> 15:11.480
it can be scary at first figuring out

15:11.480 --> 15:14.280
how much money do you even really have?

15:14.280 --> 15:19.080
You also have to sort of sum up your worth

15:19.080 --> 15:22.040
and say, how valuable am I versus the other things

15:22.040 --> 15:22.880
that are out there?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.800
That can be, you have to be pretty humble

15:24.800 --> 15:26.760
when you do that, don't you think?

15:26.760 --> 15:28.980
Yeah, and I think that's a huge part of your marketing

15:28.980 --> 15:31.960
as a project is actually pitching your value proposition.

15:31.960 --> 15:34.920
What do users get by supporting you?

15:34.920 --> 15:36.000
Why should they do it?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.440
Why should they do it continually

15:37.440 --> 15:41.040
if you're raising money on something like Patreon?

15:41.040 --> 15:42.540
That's one of the cons that she points out

15:42.540 --> 15:45.360
and this list is on something like Patreon,

15:45.360 --> 15:46.240
it can be unclear.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.120
Why do people wanna continually give you money?

15:49.120 --> 15:51.560
What is it exactly that they're funding?

15:51.560 --> 15:53.400
Yeah, and she points out that it usually taps out,

15:53.400 --> 15:55.400
they're like, there seems to be like sort of a maximum

15:55.400 --> 15:56.440
that you're gonna get there

15:56.440 --> 15:59.840
and that's just about as much saturation as you get.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.260
And I would say too, just been, you know,

16:02.260 --> 16:03.880
doing this now for a while,

16:03.880 --> 16:07.840
and something that I could do a lot, lot better at

16:07.840 --> 16:11.220
and creators like Philip DeFranco are much better at it

16:11.220 --> 16:14.640
than I am, is diversify constantly,

16:14.640 --> 16:19.080
always be looking for new avenues to try merchandise or,

16:19.080 --> 16:22.760
not, and again, and this is something

16:22.760 --> 16:23.960
I think people fuck up a lot,

16:23.960 --> 16:26.360
is don't do it from the standpoint of

16:26.360 --> 16:29.260
how the hell do I milk these people for all they worth?

16:29.260 --> 16:31.960
But think about it from the standpoint of

16:31.960 --> 16:34.220
people who get what I'm doing are my target,

16:34.220 --> 16:36.960
I wanna sell to people who I'm already engaging with

16:36.960 --> 16:39.200
and what is it that would,

16:39.200 --> 16:40.580
and this is a douchebaggy term,

16:40.580 --> 16:42.200
but this is really how you gotta think about it,

16:42.200 --> 16:44.080
what would delight them?

16:44.080 --> 16:45.800
Right, what would get them like,

16:45.800 --> 16:46.920
what would get them like fired up?

16:46.920 --> 16:48.020
Like, yeah, that's a great idea.

16:48.020 --> 16:50.320
Like, could you do something funny with a t-shirt?

16:50.320 --> 16:52.040
Then that's merch that's worth selling.

16:52.040 --> 16:54.000
You know, if you're just gonna put a basic bitch logo

16:54.000 --> 16:56.080
on there and put it over the,

16:56.080 --> 16:57.840
which I've done plenty of times,

16:57.840 --> 16:59.080
you know, why are you bothering?

16:59.080 --> 17:01.360
You know, they could go make that themselves these days

17:01.360 --> 17:02.460
if they really wanted that.

17:02.460 --> 17:04.560
You know, I'll offer something different there

17:04.560 --> 17:06.240
if you're gonna diversify.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.300
And it involves a lot of reflection,

17:08.300 --> 17:10.160
it involves a lot of understanding

17:10.160 --> 17:12.160
of what your target audience wants

17:12.160 --> 17:14.440
and what they're generating value from.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.840
And when you understand those things,

17:16.840 --> 17:19.640
you can tend to sell well to those people.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.280
And it's not because you're selling them,

17:21.280 --> 17:23.640
it's because you're providing something they already want.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.080
And you just have to kind of connect

17:25.080 --> 17:26.320
with where they're at and do that.

17:26.320 --> 17:29.200
And if that may be bugs, it could be a bug,

17:29.200 --> 17:30.920
that could be a bug bounty program.

17:30.920 --> 17:34.000
It doesn't have to necessarily be merchandise.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.600
There's a lot of options there.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.880
So definitely take a look at this guide

17:37.880 --> 17:42.680
because myself, and I bet, of course, Dan feels this way,

17:42.680 --> 17:44.400
but I know a lot of others do too.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.380
I want to see more people making money

17:46.380 --> 17:48.560
from open source than we've ever seen before.

17:48.560 --> 17:52.080
Wouldn't that be a thing, like if by the end of 2018,

17:52.080 --> 17:55.040
it's considered a viable business model

17:55.040 --> 17:58.240
to make a living producing open source software

17:58.240 --> 17:59.120
for independent.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.640
I really, really, really, really think

18:01.640 --> 18:03.980
the next few years are gonna be a great opportunity

18:03.980 --> 18:08.320
for people that can go independent and work for themselves,

18:08.320 --> 18:12.760
be a contractor or be their own business or whatever

18:12.760 --> 18:17.640
that aren't reliant on a standard paycheck.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.720
I think just at least here in the States,

18:19.720 --> 18:21.380
this is obviously a very US centric view,

18:21.380 --> 18:23.240
but I think here in the States,

18:23.240 --> 18:24.760
people that are self employable,

18:24.760 --> 18:27.220
people that can self produce

18:27.220 --> 18:28.960
and generate their own sources of income

18:28.960 --> 18:31.200
and diversify multiple sources of income

18:31.200 --> 18:33.760
are gonna have the best chance going forward.

18:33.760 --> 18:38.380
And there would be a huge benefit to open source

18:38.380 --> 18:41.040
if one of the ways you could make independent living

18:41.040 --> 18:43.060
as somebody who has some software development skills

18:43.060 --> 18:44.880
is by developing open source software.

18:44.880 --> 18:47.080
And this guide could help people figure it out

18:47.080 --> 18:51.400
because it's a bunch of really hard learned lessons

18:51.400 --> 18:54.320
over the last decade, all compiled

18:54.320 --> 18:56.320
into 16 different categories.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.160
And it's stuff that when I read through this

18:58.160 --> 19:00.200
resonates with my personal experience

19:00.200 --> 19:01.760
and resonates with stories I've heard

19:01.760 --> 19:03.280
from developers in open source.

19:03.280 --> 19:05.200
And so it's one of these things where

19:05.200 --> 19:08.040
it's a rare opportunity to get about a decade's worth

19:08.040 --> 19:10.560
of hard learned lessons in one solid read

19:10.560 --> 19:11.760
if you're trying to do this yourself.

19:11.760 --> 19:14.160
And my personal bias is really,

19:14.160 --> 19:15.520
I just wanna see more people making money

19:15.520 --> 19:17.200
developing open source.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.640
Well, I actually would like to see

19:20.640 --> 19:23.040
a little bit of a different approach also taken

19:23.040 --> 19:24.800
because I feel that a lot of projects start

19:24.800 --> 19:29.800
with this concept of just designing the software

19:30.040 --> 19:31.440
that they are passionate about.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.720
Of course, that is all that open source is about,

19:33.720 --> 19:35.320
but I think there's a big difference

19:35.320 --> 19:38.800
between making a business and making what you love.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.920
You can sometimes merge the two.

19:40.920 --> 19:41.760
And unfortunately-

19:41.760 --> 19:44.440
Sometimes you shouldn't really, to be honest.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.840
There's a reason why I don't have a Star Trek podcast.

19:46.840 --> 19:51.840
The whole thing is when you decide to make it a business,

19:51.920 --> 19:53.960
you actually have to come up with a business plan

19:53.960 --> 19:54.840
that is viable.

19:54.840 --> 19:57.080
And this is actually the problem number one

19:57.080 --> 19:59.080
for most people, in my opinion,

19:59.080 --> 20:02.000
when they come up with their open source projects,

20:02.000 --> 20:05.320
they start with the ideas of how can I get donations

20:05.320 --> 20:07.600
as soon as they start seeing the project

20:07.600 --> 20:08.960
getting some traction,

20:08.960 --> 20:11.520
and they're already succumbed into a place

20:11.520 --> 20:15.480
that they can't really charge well for their product.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.520
If you're a business, you need capital first

20:17.520 --> 20:18.440
when you start developing.

20:18.440 --> 20:19.440
You do an investment,

20:19.440 --> 20:22.080
then you expect the return of that investment.

20:22.080 --> 20:24.040
And people don't even contemplate

20:24.040 --> 20:27.000
how much of that investment they're doing themselves

20:27.000 --> 20:28.080
is worth it.

20:28.080 --> 20:30.880
That's why they don't have a way of calculating the price

20:30.880 --> 20:32.080
that they should be charging.

20:32.080 --> 20:33.960
Yes, that's very true.

20:33.960 --> 20:34.880
I've been there myself.

20:34.880 --> 20:39.880
They actually don't look out for how to,

20:39.960 --> 20:42.360
how to actually start seeing, for example,

20:42.360 --> 20:43.920
if there's actually people interested,

20:43.920 --> 20:46.360
the people that are willing to put their money

20:46.360 --> 20:48.040
where their mouth is.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.680
Oftentimes, they go around and ask,

20:49.680 --> 20:50.880
would you like to see that happen?

20:50.880 --> 20:53.080
People say, yeah, I would buy that.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.800
Then it's done and people don't pay.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.520
The developer goes like, oh, I got fooled on this.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.080
Of course, people could get it for free.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.280
They would get it for free.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.960
Bashful Robot, you have some thoughts on sustainability

21:04.960 --> 21:06.320
and some pushback on it.

21:06.320 --> 21:07.880
And then I'll go back to you, dear Devlin.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.640
Go ahead, Bashful.

21:09.640 --> 21:12.960
All I was really gonna say is you look at some people,

21:12.960 --> 21:15.840
like the sustainability loops back

21:15.840 --> 21:17.800
to what you were saying before

21:17.800 --> 21:19.600
with why they're asking for donations.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.600
So that was kind of like one little point

21:21.600 --> 21:24.280
was just that maybe that's the approach to take.

21:24.280 --> 21:28.200
Then the other point was the pushback.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.720
Like, for example, I don't know if you're familiar

21:29.720 --> 21:31.640
with what happened with the Caddy project, but-

21:31.640 --> 21:33.480
No, could you give me a background on that?

21:33.480 --> 21:34.320
Yeah, a little bit.

21:34.320 --> 21:37.440
So Caddy is an HTTP2 server written in Go.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.480
Mark Bates is the author and it was open source.

21:40.480 --> 21:43.440
And he basically started building out

21:43.440 --> 21:46.280
or attempting to build out a business behind it.

21:46.280 --> 21:50.600
And the only form of sponsorship was like an HTTP header

21:50.600 --> 21:52.160
that they just injected in there.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.480
So a lot of people got super PO

21:54.480 --> 21:58.280
that they thought it was gonna be like a closed source thing.

21:58.280 --> 21:59.200
They didn't like the header,

21:59.200 --> 22:01.960
which in some ways I can sort of see,

22:01.960 --> 22:05.880
but then he just basically got raked over the coals

22:05.880 --> 22:07.920
trying to find a way to monetize

22:07.920 --> 22:10.120
and continue on with the work.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.560
And you think there's some entitlement there?

22:12.560 --> 22:14.640
Yeah, I think so because if you look at,

22:14.640 --> 22:16.040
like people get something for free

22:16.040 --> 22:18.200
and you could even take that

22:18.200 --> 22:20.480
and look at it from the point of view of like support.

22:20.480 --> 22:23.720
And a lot of people are doing this in their spare time

22:23.720 --> 22:26.880
and they almost expect you to answer like immediately,

22:26.880 --> 22:28.960
or they expect you to fix the bug immediately

22:28.960 --> 22:32.800
or add the feature set and along those lines.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.160
And it's kind of like now, now, now,

22:34.160 --> 22:37.600
whereas anyone may have like five different things

22:37.600 --> 22:39.000
that they're trying to do.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.840
And it's not necessarily just that one project.

22:41.840 --> 22:43.320
Or if you look at some of the other people,

22:43.320 --> 22:47.640
like even like Wimpy and them who work full-time

22:47.640 --> 22:50.640
for Canonical, they've got certain obligations there.

22:50.640 --> 22:54.040
Plus, he's got Monte and all the other stuff

22:54.040 --> 22:55.520
that he's got his fingers in.

22:55.520 --> 22:59.160
Like he's, I don't know how he does it, to be honest.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.120
Wimpy, you are a machine, that is for sure.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.320
Yeah.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.240
Derek Delvin, I wanted to let you finish your thought though

23:04.240 --> 23:06.880
because I know you were kind of wrapping that up.

23:06.880 --> 23:10.120
So basically it's like actually one of his last point

23:10.120 --> 23:12.600
that is actually also about setting expectations.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.240
And the other thing, unfortunately, that I see happening

23:15.240 --> 23:17.200
is that people often forget

23:17.200 --> 23:19.920
how the GPL was intended to be monetized.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.360
It is the developer gets paid to write code,

23:22.360 --> 23:24.400
not developer gets paid for releases

23:24.400 --> 23:27.240
or for versions or licensing.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.480
And a lot of these models that people come up

23:29.480 --> 23:32.320
with open source is like, oh, I'm about to download

23:32.320 --> 23:35.240
and they, you know, everybody chooses what they want,

23:35.240 --> 23:37.200
but I'm about to download so I give a donation.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.880
It's equivalent of paying for the current version

23:39.880 --> 23:41.320
or current license.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.960
And that is kind of what leads to most of the problems.

23:43.960 --> 23:45.760
So if you actually come with a value proposition

23:45.760 --> 23:48.000
of code gets written upon payment

23:48.000 --> 23:50.800
and this is what it costs to produce these code,

23:50.800 --> 23:53.520
then you could either only invest in it

23:53.520 --> 23:55.760
if you effectively got the money.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.920
And in that way you could support sustainably

23:57.920 --> 24:00.840
your development and it would be like any other contract.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.480
Stallman has talked about these over and over.

24:03.480 --> 24:07.160
The idea is to get developers to get paid to write code

24:07.160 --> 24:09.520
so that then the ownership is true.

24:09.520 --> 24:13.160
The person who paid for the code has ownership over it.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.840
So Dan, do you think as a project,

24:14.840 --> 24:18.880
there is messaging here to that if you just position

24:18.880 --> 24:20.920
the project and make it clear

24:20.920 --> 24:23.400
that these are our resources, this is our availability,

24:23.400 --> 24:25.480
is that the solution to entitlement Dan

24:25.480 --> 24:27.480
or is it deeper than that?

24:27.480 --> 24:29.560
Yeah, I absolutely think messaging is super important.

24:29.560 --> 24:32.120
I mean, you know firsthand that a few years ago

24:32.120 --> 24:34.400
we had some terrible messaging and came on your show

24:34.400 --> 24:36.720
to try to fix it because it was so bad

24:36.720 --> 24:41.720
and had huge pushback and it still burned us to this day.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.920
Yeah, yeah, just recently in a Reddit thread

24:43.920 --> 24:45.600
you and I were talking about somebody brought it up

24:45.600 --> 24:47.240
and it's like, come on.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.400
Yeah. It's just ancient history.

24:49.400 --> 24:52.280
But definitely figuring out how to navigate around

24:52.280 --> 24:55.080
these are not the good ways to communicate

24:55.080 --> 24:57.200
and these are the good ways to communicate

24:57.200 --> 24:59.360
and being able to express to people

24:59.360 --> 25:04.080
about how you want to meet their expectations

25:04.080 --> 25:05.680
and you want to provide the features

25:05.680 --> 25:08.680
and that it isn't that you don't care

25:08.680 --> 25:10.200
because they want to know that you care about them

25:10.200 --> 25:13.040
and that you're trying and to explain

25:13.040 --> 25:16.200
that this is the best that we can do

25:16.200 --> 25:19.240
with the resources we have and if we had these resources

25:19.240 --> 25:21.360
then we would be able to do that thing

25:21.360 --> 25:23.280
and try to make it a negotiation.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.960
You're so right, Dan,

25:24.960 --> 25:29.000
because you guys have been a case study of that.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.180
So, I mean, that is 100% legitimate experience

25:32.180 --> 25:35.360
that you have and I cannot disagree with that.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.160
It's kind of funny if you think about it

25:37.160 --> 25:39.420
because I can't really think of,

25:40.400 --> 25:42.940
I'm gonna give a second before I say this out loud,

25:43.980 --> 25:46.360
but I can't think of two other projects

25:46.360 --> 25:47.800
that are better at explaining

25:47.800 --> 25:49.840
why the hell you should pay for them

25:49.840 --> 25:52.560
than elementary OS and Ubuntu MATE.

25:57.280 --> 26:00.640
So Wimpy's posts, I'll tell you what I like

26:00.640 --> 26:04.380
about Wimpy's posts for the Ubuntu MATE project on Patreon

26:04.380 --> 26:06.880
that have inspired me now for a couple of years

26:06.880 --> 26:08.960
and I still haven't gotten my shit together

26:08.960 --> 26:11.000
on how to do this for Jupiter broadcasting,

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
but Wimpy will say, we spent $126 to this guy

26:16.160 --> 26:17.960
or whatever to develop this feature

26:17.960 --> 26:21.040
and we spent a hundred and whatever with this project

26:21.040 --> 26:23.520
and we sent this much of your money to this project.

26:23.520 --> 26:27.560
Wimpy, did you have an intentional rationale

26:27.560 --> 26:29.400
behind those posts to specifically say

26:29.400 --> 26:32.640
this is the value you're getting from your contribution?

26:32.640 --> 26:36.720
Was there like some reflection you did to say,

26:36.720 --> 26:38.940
I need to tell people what they're getting

26:38.940 --> 26:40.140
with their contribution?

26:42.760 --> 26:43.860
Is he there?

26:43.860 --> 26:44.920
It was such a good question.

26:44.920 --> 26:45.760
It really was.

26:45.760 --> 26:46.920
It was a great question.

26:46.920 --> 26:49.880
That's okay, it's okay.

26:49.880 --> 26:50.720
Go ahead, Eric.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.040
I know you wanna jump in, so I'll jump to you.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.560
Go ahead.

26:53.560 --> 26:56.960
Yeah, well, I mean, I can speak to a lot of this.

26:56.960 --> 27:01.320
I work full time for an online education company,

27:01.320 --> 27:04.360
but on the side, I own an IT consulting business.

27:04.360 --> 27:05.360
Oh, okay.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.780
And that consulting business recently,

27:07.780 --> 27:12.780
actually day before yesterday, just lost our best client

27:12.860 --> 27:16.240
because even though I took time off from my day job,

27:16.240 --> 27:19.800
like took vacation time in the middle of the day

27:19.800 --> 27:24.000
to go and help with what they considered was an emergency.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.920
It ended up being something fairly simple,

27:25.920 --> 27:27.760
but to them, it was an emergency.

27:27.760 --> 27:31.160
And so I left my day job to go help them out.

27:31.160 --> 27:34.920
And it ended up being Windows 10 Home Edition

27:34.920 --> 27:36.000
was their problem.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.640
They bought a computer that I didn't recommend

27:38.640 --> 27:42.280
and they got Windows 10 Home instead of Windows 10 Pro.

27:42.280 --> 27:47.280
And to be honest, I went into the situation

27:47.280 --> 27:50.560
not having my ducks in a row

27:50.560 --> 27:52.880
because I tried to pitch switching to Linux,

27:52.880 --> 27:57.240
getting away from all the licensing with Microsoft

27:57.240 --> 28:00.000
and that kind of thing and supporting open source.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.760
And they basically fluffed it off as,

28:04.760 --> 28:07.280
well, that Linux thing that's just for nerds.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.120
I've been there.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.160
Yep, I'm really sorry.

28:09.160 --> 28:10.000
That sucks.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.960
Losing a client too is like the worst thing ever,

28:12.960 --> 28:15.120
especially when they don't follow your recommendations.

28:15.120 --> 28:19.160
That is the worst, yeah.

28:19.160 --> 28:21.120
I'm sorry to hear that, Eric.

28:21.120 --> 28:24.000
Wimpy, sounds like you have your situation sorted, sir.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.320
Do you remember my question?

28:26.320 --> 28:28.000
I do, yes.

28:28.000 --> 28:28.960
It always helps to remember

28:28.960 --> 28:30.800
which key you've bound to push to talk.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.640
I love it.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.760
I love it, push to talk.

28:34.760 --> 28:38.740
Well, it's good to hear you and yeah, please run with it.

28:38.740 --> 28:43.160
Yes, my intention with those messages that we send out

28:43.160 --> 28:47.520
is to exactly explain to the patrons

28:48.480 --> 28:50.400
how the money is being spent,

28:50.400 --> 28:55.400
but more importantly, the value that that has to the project.

28:55.520 --> 28:59.680
And oftentimes the way that the money is being used

28:59.680 --> 29:03.760
is to fund development that the teams

29:03.760 --> 29:05.120
that are involved right now

29:05.120 --> 29:08.200
who volunteer their timeframe freely

29:08.200 --> 29:11.480
wouldn't have time to do if they weren't incentivized

29:11.480 --> 29:13.640
or compensated in some way

29:13.640 --> 29:15.680
in order to work on those projects.

29:16.560 --> 29:19.560
Now, do you agree with my assessment

29:19.560 --> 29:22.320
that the way to think about a patron

29:22.320 --> 29:24.880
or some other sort of reoccurring contribution

29:24.880 --> 29:27.480
to an open source project is if you reframe it

29:27.480 --> 29:28.880
as they're your client

29:28.880 --> 29:32.000
and you need to constantly remind your client

29:32.000 --> 29:37.000
why their contribution or their patronage of you is useful.

29:38.240 --> 29:41.000
Like you're communicating to them on an ongoing basis.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.580
It's almost a sales position.

29:42.580 --> 29:44.560
It's really sort of doing sales,

29:44.560 --> 29:46.560
but in a more genuine way.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.200
I don't mean to like douchebag it up a little bit,

29:48.200 --> 29:50.100
but don't you feel like it's kind of like

29:50.100 --> 29:54.000
a client relationship that you're reselling your value to?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.200
It really is.

29:55.200 --> 29:58.960
I mean, there are months when I don't get the time

29:58.960 --> 30:03.520
to post a patron as detailed as I would like

30:03.520 --> 30:05.280
or as regularly as I would like.

30:05.280 --> 30:08.240
And when you get a couple of months off the back like that,

30:08.240 --> 30:12.560
you do see people reining in their support.

30:12.560 --> 30:15.040
So they'll reduce their contributions

30:15.040 --> 30:17.600
or they will opt out entirely.

30:17.600 --> 30:21.180
So it is very much a client management relationship

30:21.180 --> 30:23.480
in that respect for some people at least.

30:23.480 --> 30:24.320
Yeah.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.480
And I don't know, those are just sort of my insights.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.480
And I think Wimpy's and Dan's insights

30:29.480 --> 30:32.960
that if you wanna try to monetize an open source project

30:32.960 --> 30:34.960
or something like that, just things to consider.

30:34.960 --> 30:39.080
And boy, I'd love to see more people be successful.

30:39.080 --> 30:43.480
I try to back as many people as I can on Patreon.

30:43.480 --> 30:44.560
It's getting to be that point.

30:44.560 --> 30:45.520
Absolutely.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.840
But I try to because I really wanna see more people

30:47.840 --> 30:51.200
be successful and wanna see people do this long term.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.460
Sounds like we have more thoughts on this.

30:52.460 --> 30:54.680
So Eric and others, let's take it up in the post-show.

30:54.680 --> 30:55.500
Save it, please.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.680
Don't mind me because I will forget by the time we get there

30:57.680 --> 30:59.600
because right now I gotta stop

30:59.600 --> 31:01.560
and take a moment and thank Linux Academy.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.440
And to be honest with you,

31:02.440 --> 31:04.080
I'm so excited about freaking Linux Academy

31:04.080 --> 31:06.080
that I'm not gonna remember what we wanted to talk about

31:06.080 --> 31:07.680
because it's finally here.

31:07.680 --> 31:09.800
Finally, a platform to learn more about Linux

31:09.800 --> 31:11.720
that's been created by Linux enthusiasts,

31:11.720 --> 31:13.280
has been developed by developers

31:13.280 --> 31:15.560
that really, really know their ass.

31:15.560 --> 31:17.520
Like they can build complicated systems

31:17.520 --> 31:20.280
that match courseware and distros and virtual machines.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.200
And they all bring it together in a platform

31:22.200 --> 31:24.360
that teaches you everything around Linux

31:24.360 --> 31:27.360
to make money and to be more successful in your career.

31:27.360 --> 31:28.200
It's Linux Academy.

31:28.200 --> 31:29.160
Whether you're an experienced sysadmin

31:29.160 --> 31:32.320
or new to the world of Linux, Azure and AWS,

31:32.320 --> 31:33.900
OpenStack and DevOps,

31:33.900 --> 31:37.520
a sharp skillset is an absolute necessity to succeed.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.960
Meet Linux Academy,

31:38.960 --> 31:41.840
an online Linux and cloud training platform

31:41.840 --> 31:45.520
that uses self-paced video courses and hands-on labs

31:45.520 --> 31:47.520
to give you real-world experience

31:47.520 --> 31:49.520
for a wide range of skills.

31:49.520 --> 31:51.120
Train for your certification,

31:51.120 --> 31:53.000
learn the latest DevOps tools

31:53.000 --> 31:55.360
and grow your skillset to do better work.

31:55.360 --> 31:58.200
Linux Academy is not just a video library.

31:58.200 --> 32:01.040
Our scenario-based server labs and quiz system

32:01.040 --> 32:03.080
allow you to learn hands-on.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.400
We also have full-time human instructors

32:05.400 --> 32:08.640
who answer questions and help you earn that certification

32:08.640 --> 32:10.180
or promotion at work.

32:10.180 --> 32:11.900
We add new training every week

32:11.900 --> 32:14.680
so you'll always be up to date on the latest tech.

32:14.680 --> 32:18.160
Sysadmins of every experience level use Linux Academy

32:18.160 --> 32:21.400
to stay on the bleeding edge of the Linux ecosystem.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.840
You should too.

32:22.840 --> 32:23.680
While you're laughing,

32:23.680 --> 32:26.560
the hackers are dropping malware into your system.

32:26.560 --> 32:28.920
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug

32:28.920 --> 32:31.200
to get a free seven-day trial and support the show.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.840
Try out their hands-on labs,

32:32.840 --> 32:34.900
their testing for certs, their courseware,

32:34.900 --> 32:37.040
their downloadable comprehensive study guides.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.520
It's amazing, you guys.

32:38.520 --> 32:41.280
Old young, or I should say young Chris

32:41.280 --> 32:44.640
would envy old Chris, which is present Chris.

32:44.640 --> 32:46.640
It's complicated for the Linux Academy.

32:46.640 --> 32:47.520
I mean, it's one of the things

32:47.520 --> 32:48.840
that I just couldn't even imagine

32:48.840 --> 32:49.680
when I was getting started.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.480
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

32:51.480 --> 32:54.240
Oh, thank you Linux Academy

32:54.240 --> 32:57.040
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

32:57.040 --> 33:01.880
So the folks over at ours decided to review Ubuntu 17.10.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.360
It's about time.

33:03.360 --> 33:07.360
Scott Gilbertson posted on November 27th,

33:07.360 --> 33:10.840
just a couple of days ago, at 4.30 in the morning,

33:10.840 --> 33:13.600
his review of Ubuntu 17.10.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.080
Now, who do you suppose that's about?

33:15.080 --> 33:17.800
4.30 in the morning, that's really something.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.520
And I find it to be interesting

33:19.520 --> 33:22.440
to just get like sort of an outside the bubble take

33:23.560 --> 33:24.920
on the Ubuntu 17.10 release.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.360
That's sort of what I thought was fascinating about this,

33:26.360 --> 33:27.840
sort of outside the bubble.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.680
And there's a couple of elements of this review

33:30.680 --> 33:31.780
that jumped out at me.

33:34.520 --> 33:35.340
What was his name?

33:35.340 --> 33:36.820
His name was Scott.

33:36.820 --> 33:39.500
So Scott writes, in light of the gnome switch,

33:39.500 --> 33:41.780
this really seems more like a homecoming

33:41.780 --> 33:43.700
than an entirely new voyage.

33:45.320 --> 33:46.380
More like a homecoming.

33:46.380 --> 33:47.520
Yeah, I kind of agree.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.800
It does kind of feel like more like a return to gnome.

33:49.800 --> 33:50.640
Yeah, it really does.

33:50.640 --> 33:55.440
Yeah, and a return to community-inspired design

33:55.440 --> 33:58.540
and building and packaging, right?

33:58.540 --> 33:59.560
And feature sets.

34:00.780 --> 34:03.400
One of the things that when Dustin Kirkland

34:03.400 --> 34:04.880
was going around and doing the survey

34:04.880 --> 34:07.400
and asking what people wanted on Ubuntu,

34:07.400 --> 34:10.160
the thing that really stood out to me is,

34:10.160 --> 34:11.600
ah, this feels like old Ubuntu.

34:11.600 --> 34:14.320
This feels like old, early days Ubuntu.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.400
The whole entire thing felt like that to me.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.320
So I completely agreed with Scott's take here.

34:18.320 --> 34:20.080
It's like more of a return, really.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.880
He goes on to write a couple other interesting points.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.000
A recent call for community input

34:29.000 --> 34:32.360
on the new Ubuntu desktop theme seems to message a point

34:32.360 --> 34:33.800
about the new Ubuntu desktop,

34:33.800 --> 34:36.200
one that's more community-centric.

34:36.200 --> 34:37.200
And then he writes,

34:38.760 --> 34:42.000
Canonical got rid of most of its design team.

34:43.240 --> 34:46.120
So in one sense, it has no choice

34:46.120 --> 34:49.760
but to farm these things out to the community.

34:49.760 --> 34:50.600
Ha ha!

34:54.360 --> 34:55.480
Pobie, I don't know if you wanted to,

34:55.480 --> 34:56.880
in your personal opinion,

34:56.880 --> 34:58.440
did you want to respond to that particular line

34:58.440 --> 34:59.260
in this review?

34:59.260 --> 35:01.640
Because that's a bold statement right there.

35:01.640 --> 35:04.140
Canonical got rid of the desktop team.

35:04.140 --> 35:06.160
No more designers working on the desktop.

35:06.160 --> 35:09.400
And their only option now is to cheap it out

35:09.400 --> 35:11.320
and go to the community for a theme.

35:11.320 --> 35:12.640
What do you think of that?

35:12.640 --> 35:16.120
Yeah, it's not the first time I've heard people say that.

35:16.120 --> 35:18.960
People have said in the past similar kind of things

35:18.960 --> 35:21.260
about how we don't have a design team

35:21.260 --> 35:23.080
or the design team don't care.

35:23.080 --> 35:25.000
There's always some reason,

35:25.000 --> 35:26.780
there's always some ulterior motive

35:26.780 --> 35:29.720
for why we're asking the community for input.

35:29.720 --> 35:32.060
It can't possibly be that we're just asking them

35:32.060 --> 35:34.480
because we value their opinion as users

35:34.480 --> 35:36.860
and experts in the field.

35:36.860 --> 35:40.680
Like that can't possibly be the reason why we're asking.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.840
Yeah, it does seem to be like there's an assumption,

35:42.840 --> 35:44.440
just an assumption.

35:44.440 --> 35:49.440
Now, would you acknowledge that it does,

35:50.640 --> 35:54.720
I think some of that comes from this recent restructuring

35:54.720 --> 35:57.040
at Canonical where people just kind of,

35:57.040 --> 35:59.000
it's people don't know from the outside.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.820
They don't really know who's left

36:00.820 --> 36:02.000
and who's working on what.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.920
So they just make their assumptions from the outside

36:03.920 --> 36:06.300
that, well, they got rid of the Unity 8 folks,

36:06.300 --> 36:08.040
they got rid of the people working on artwork

36:08.040 --> 36:10.280
and now they just have the core team of people

36:10.280 --> 36:12.560
that we hear about and that's it.

36:12.560 --> 36:13.520
And so they have to do this.

36:13.520 --> 36:16.620
I mean, the perspective seems reasonable to me

36:16.620 --> 36:18.440
just completely from the outside.

36:19.720 --> 36:23.760
To some degree, we did downsize to some degree back in April

36:23.760 --> 36:25.400
and that was a struggle.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.800
And there are people who were lost

36:27.800 --> 36:32.560
through all areas of the business.

36:32.560 --> 36:36.020
So some, yep, certainly some people were lost from design

36:36.020 --> 36:38.520
and some people lost from the desktop team

36:38.520 --> 36:41.100
and some people lost from all other parts of the company.

36:41.100 --> 36:43.900
It wasn't just, if you worked on Unity 8,

36:43.900 --> 36:45.160
you're out the door and that's it.

36:45.160 --> 36:47.560
There were people lost from all over the place

36:47.560 --> 36:49.540
and that was difficult for us.

36:50.540 --> 36:55.540
But the thing about Unity 7 and theming and stuff,

36:56.940 --> 37:01.940
we haven't made a lot of effort in Unity 7 changes

37:03.260 --> 37:04.880
for a number of years.

37:04.880 --> 37:07.860
Like we haven't, it's been mostly maintenance mode

37:07.860 --> 37:11.520
for some time because our focus was on other things

37:11.520 --> 37:14.040
like the phone, for example.

37:14.040 --> 37:17.480
And we spent a lot of time cultivating a community

37:17.480 --> 37:20.800
around the phone and now we're no longer doing that.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.680
We've refocused back on the desktop.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.880
It's not like we stopped asking the community for input.

37:25.880 --> 37:28.280
It's just that our focus was on something else

37:28.280 --> 37:29.240
and yeah, we've refocused.

37:29.240 --> 37:32.720
So his comments about returning home

37:32.720 --> 37:34.480
and coming back to the Ubuntu of old,

37:34.480 --> 37:36.840
that's not unsurprising given that we're no longer working

37:36.840 --> 37:39.600
on things that some people thought we shouldn't

37:39.600 --> 37:41.280
have been working on in the first place.

37:41.280 --> 37:42.120
Right, right.

37:42.120 --> 37:45.360
I think when you look at it in a wider context,

37:45.360 --> 37:49.040
you look at people that are also on the new community site

37:49.040 --> 37:52.720
that are discussing, what do you wanna see from Mir?

37:52.720 --> 37:56.960
What do you think about a Unity 7 remix of 1804?

37:56.960 --> 37:59.500
When you look at the discussions that are taking place

37:59.500 --> 38:01.440
on the new community portal or hub,

38:01.440 --> 38:02.880
what's the, what should I call it, Poppy?

38:02.880 --> 38:03.720
What do I call it?

38:03.720 --> 38:04.560
The new community hub.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.040
When you look at all of the discussions

38:06.040 --> 38:09.280
that are taking place, then the theme discussion fits in

38:09.280 --> 38:12.160
as just one of many wide ranging discussions

38:12.160 --> 38:13.440
that are now taking place.

38:13.440 --> 38:16.280
But when you look at it in, it's in just,

38:16.280 --> 38:18.640
if you look at just the theme discussion,

38:18.640 --> 38:21.200
it looks like, oh, we're tossing it to the community.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.080
And when in reality, you guys are seeking input

38:23.080 --> 38:25.080
on like three or four different topics

38:25.080 --> 38:27.280
that I can think of just off the top of my head right now.

38:27.280 --> 38:28.680
And it's a change, you're right.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.300
What it is, is it's a behavior change

38:31.300 --> 38:34.480
from the last few years.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.560
It's an adjustment to a behavior change.

38:36.560 --> 38:41.120
Yeah, and part of the reason why we changed

38:41.120 --> 38:43.360
and rebooted the community website

38:43.360 --> 38:46.060
was because it didn't lend itself particularly well.

38:46.060 --> 38:48.920
I mean, something I've said to other people recently

38:48.920 --> 38:52.680
is that a lot of this engagement happened

38:52.680 --> 38:54.120
over the last few years.

38:54.120 --> 38:55.360
You just didn't see it.

38:55.360 --> 38:57.180
It just wasn't particularly visible.

38:57.180 --> 38:59.480
It was buried on IRC channels.

38:59.480 --> 39:00.680
There were conversations happening

39:00.680 --> 39:03.120
in an Ubuntu desktop IRC channel on FreeNode,

39:03.120 --> 39:05.120
while the conversation was happening on a mailing list

39:05.120 --> 39:07.640
somewhere, it's public, but nobody found it.

39:07.640 --> 39:10.680
And it wasn't particularly easy to engage with.

39:10.680 --> 39:15.080
Modern projects are using things like Slack,

39:15.080 --> 39:18.280
like discourse to make it easier for members

39:18.280 --> 39:21.560
of the community to get on board and voice their opinion

39:21.560 --> 39:23.600
and say, yeah, I'd like to help.

39:23.600 --> 39:26.280
If the way you get on board is, well, first of all,

39:26.280 --> 39:29.100
you've got to sign up to this mailman mailing list,

39:29.100 --> 39:31.240
then people are gonna be like, no, screw that.

39:31.240 --> 39:33.200
I don't even use email anymore.

39:33.200 --> 39:37.880
Right, and so part of this is planned.

39:37.880 --> 39:40.560
You know, we wanted to make it easier,

39:40.560 --> 39:42.280
the onboarding process, the whole reason

39:42.280 --> 39:45.680
why the Community Hub exists is to make it easier

39:45.680 --> 39:48.340
for that onboarding process so that we can start

39:48.340 --> 39:51.240
having initiatives which are, you know, new design

39:51.240 --> 39:52.880
or get involved in a new flavor,

39:52.880 --> 39:55.160
or what should we do about this feature,

39:55.160 --> 39:57.040
or what should we do about this particular

39:57.040 --> 39:58.360
piece of software?

39:58.360 --> 40:00.880
It's to make it easier for people to engage with us.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.720
And people are engaging, as you've said.

40:02.720 --> 40:03.800
Can I ask you something?

40:03.800 --> 40:04.720
Oh, go ahead, go ahead.

40:04.720 --> 40:06.440
I'd just like to add to that as well.

40:06.440 --> 40:10.380
What makes contributing to the themes so sacred?

40:10.380 --> 40:12.640
Why is it that all of the community members

40:12.640 --> 40:16.960
that contribute translations or file bugs

40:16.960 --> 40:21.740
or submit patches or work on the upstream code

40:21.740 --> 40:24.260
that Ubuntu and many other distributions are made of,

40:24.260 --> 40:26.920
why is it that that kind of contribution is fine,

40:26.920 --> 40:29.640
but suddenly asking people to work on themes

40:29.640 --> 40:32.480
is suddenly taboo and you've sold out,

40:32.480 --> 40:34.400
you've thrown it all to the community,

40:34.400 --> 40:35.560
you don't care anymore?

40:35.560 --> 40:38.520
I guess because the fantasy is that Canonical

40:38.520 --> 40:40.760
has like these super high-end developers

40:40.760 --> 40:42.840
that are secretly using Macs with Adobe Photoshop

40:42.840 --> 40:44.840
to create themes that we don't have.

40:44.840 --> 40:45.680
I don't know.

40:47.160 --> 40:48.340
No, I don't think it's that.

40:48.340 --> 40:50.880
I think it's that for some reason people have it

40:50.880 --> 40:53.100
in their head that design is not a thing

40:53.100 --> 40:55.440
that people contribute for the love

40:55.440 --> 40:56.480
of wanting to contribute.

40:56.480 --> 40:57.720
You have to pay designers.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.720
That's the only way to get good design

40:59.720 --> 41:00.820
is you have to pay them.

41:00.820 --> 41:03.480
Yet software developers, people who provide patches,

41:03.480 --> 41:06.040
people who do translations, people who write documentation,

41:06.040 --> 41:08.080
they can all do it for free for the love of it

41:08.080 --> 41:10.000
in their spare time, but designers, no,

41:10.000 --> 41:11.040
you have to pay them.

41:11.040 --> 41:13.280
And I think it's a ludicrous assertion

41:13.280 --> 41:16.000
that these are entirely separate different people

41:16.000 --> 41:17.320
that have to be paid.

41:17.320 --> 41:19.400
I'm not saying never pay them,

41:19.400 --> 41:22.000
but the assertion that for some reason

41:22.000 --> 41:24.140
we shouldn't be able to ask the community

41:24.140 --> 41:26.760
to give us help in the areas of design

41:26.760 --> 41:29.700
in the same way that we ask people to help us translate,

41:29.700 --> 41:33.440
patch, test ISOs and write documentation,

41:33.440 --> 41:35.340
I think is bizarre.

41:35.340 --> 41:38.500
Okay, all right, that's a pretty good point.

41:38.500 --> 41:40.820
Yeah, it's just a sort of a reframing

41:40.820 --> 41:41.940
of how you think about it.

41:41.940 --> 41:45.160
So Dan, I think you and I would agree on one point,

41:45.160 --> 41:47.960
the biggest point of branding could be the theme.

41:47.960 --> 41:51.720
Like this is where Ubuntu could really kind of be,

41:51.720 --> 41:55.260
you see it and it's obviously Ubuntu.

41:55.260 --> 41:57.640
So it's not really even, it's not a theme,

41:57.640 --> 41:58.720
it's an experience, isn't it?

41:58.720 --> 42:00.220
It's like the Ubuntu experience.

42:00.220 --> 42:02.640
And it seems like owning that is pretty critical

42:02.640 --> 42:05.920
to have a desktop that's truly an Ubuntu feeling,

42:05.920 --> 42:08.220
like it's the heart of Ubuntu.

42:08.220 --> 42:12.360
Yeah, and honestly, I mean, my personal stance is

42:12.360 --> 42:14.480
themes are dead, it doesn't really,

42:14.480 --> 42:17.280
like style sheets are API these days,

42:17.280 --> 42:19.200
they're important for applications.

42:19.200 --> 42:23.560
And I think your style sheet and your icons

42:23.560 --> 42:26.940
are just as important as any other component

42:26.940 --> 42:28.740
of the desktop environment.

42:28.740 --> 42:31.440
You wouldn't say, I mean, when you,

42:31.440 --> 42:34.160
when Canonical decided to stop doing Unity 8,

42:34.160 --> 42:35.400
they didn't say, okay, community,

42:35.400 --> 42:38.300
come up with a new desktop environment, you know?

42:38.300 --> 42:39.140
Right.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.400
Like that's, it's important work

42:40.400 --> 42:42.220
that you just don't hold a contest for.

42:42.220 --> 42:45.080
You know, like there has to be a direction and a vision

42:45.080 --> 42:48.440
and they said, hey, we're gonna go with GNOME

42:48.440 --> 42:50.280
and then took feedback

42:50.280 --> 42:53.140
on how are we gonna present GNOME, right?

42:53.140 --> 42:55.440
And then they didn't leave that up to a vote

42:55.440 --> 42:57.360
or hold a contest or anything like that, right?

42:57.360 --> 43:00.260
It was, well, let's take the feedback into consideration

43:00.260 --> 43:01.680
and let's, you know, do surveys

43:01.680 --> 43:04.720
and there it was much more of a directed effort.

43:04.720 --> 43:07.800
And I think that's probably what people are objecting to

43:07.800 --> 43:09.200
is it kind of seems like, it's like,

43:09.200 --> 43:12.040
ah, you know, we don't care, it's just paint, you know?

43:12.040 --> 43:16.100
Yeah, but what if, and I know this is a long shot,

43:16.100 --> 43:18.000
but what if you can end up with something

43:18.000 --> 43:21.960
that's like 90% there and it's pretty damn good

43:21.960 --> 43:23.720
and you take your own internal team

43:23.720 --> 43:27.240
and you round off that last 10% and you make it great

43:27.240 --> 43:31.400
and then you over the next three LTS releases,

43:31.400 --> 43:34.000
I mean, I'm talking a really long-term scale here,

43:34.000 --> 43:37.360
you make it specifically the Ubuntu branded desktop theme.

43:37.360 --> 43:40.520
And it, but it starts with, the thing that I like

43:40.520 --> 43:42.960
about going to the community about this is,

43:42.960 --> 43:44.840
well, let's get the most modern takes

43:44.840 --> 43:45.920
on what makes the best theme.

43:45.920 --> 43:48.120
Like let's get the Arc people involved,

43:48.120 --> 43:49.800
let's get the Mocha people, let's get everybody,

43:49.800 --> 43:51.360
people that are loving the Pop OS stuff,

43:51.360 --> 43:53.600
let's get everybody involved that's loving all that stuff

43:53.600 --> 43:56.360
and get the best, most modern version

43:56.360 --> 43:58.040
of a Linux desktop theme that we can get

43:58.040 --> 44:00.240
because GTK 3 can be beautiful.

44:00.240 --> 44:03.440
And so let's just see the most latest version of that.

44:03.440 --> 44:05.540
Yeah, but the problem is like, in reality,

44:05.540 --> 44:07.180
what you get is everybody just upvotes

44:07.180 --> 44:10.280
like trendy crap that's broken, you know?

44:11.600 --> 44:14.100
It's like nothing that somebody actually put time into.

44:14.100 --> 44:16.400
I think, you know, the decision that was made

44:16.400 --> 44:20.400
to have Sam do the Suru icons is like a no-brainer,

44:20.400 --> 44:23.120
and like not doing that would be a huge mistake to me.

44:23.120 --> 44:26.280
So what I would, you know, if I were someone

44:26.280 --> 44:29.280
that had power in the Ubuntu canonical realm

44:29.280 --> 44:30.900
is that I would say, hey, you know,

44:30.900 --> 44:33.640
all this great design work that we did for Unity 8,

44:33.640 --> 44:37.520
let's rally a community around building a style sheet

44:37.520 --> 44:39.000
that lives up to that ideal.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.520
And let's build what we all, you know,

44:41.520 --> 44:44.920
invested in, you know, before GTK 3.

44:47.200 --> 44:48.640
That's really a thing, though.

44:48.640 --> 44:51.800
I mean, that's a thing that you gotta take on and maintain

44:51.800 --> 44:56.440
and then really own for years and years and years,

44:56.440 --> 44:58.840
especially when you ship it in an LTS, you know?

44:58.840 --> 45:01.000
And whereas if you start with Edwardia

45:01.000 --> 45:05.160
and then you make Edwardia good and usable by human beings,

45:05.160 --> 45:07.160
you're almost all the way there.

45:07.160 --> 45:10.320
I'll say this, I'm not really, on my machine at home

45:10.320 --> 45:12.680
that I use all day long and all night long

45:12.680 --> 45:17.680
on my non-workdays, it's an Ubuntu LTS 16.04 Unity 7

45:17.680 --> 45:19.720
with the ArcDark theme.

45:19.720 --> 45:22.560
And I forget the icon theme,

45:22.560 --> 45:25.060
but I'm not using the standard one.

45:25.060 --> 45:26.480
But the thing that really strikes me

45:26.480 --> 45:29.120
about the old theme that comes with Unity 7

45:29.120 --> 45:34.120
is it's extremely glance-able.

45:34.480 --> 45:36.120
Like, you can just look at the icons

45:36.120 --> 45:37.400
and you know immediately what they are.

45:37.400 --> 45:40.560
They're large, they're readable, it holds up.

45:40.560 --> 45:42.520
Unity 7's theme today holds up.

45:42.520 --> 45:44.760
It holds up in high DPI even, it holds up.

45:44.760 --> 45:47.240
It holds up better than some current themes hold up.

45:47.240 --> 45:50.520
Surprisingly, it feels dated but it holds up.

45:50.520 --> 45:52.760
And so in some ways, because they sort of,

45:52.760 --> 45:55.700
they did own that and they really kind of took that

45:55.700 --> 45:58.320
under their wing, you know, years later, it still works.

45:58.320 --> 46:00.720
It still holds up, it's just feeling old these days.

46:00.720 --> 46:03.880
So I do follow you, Dan, and I do completely agree

46:03.880 --> 46:08.320
that if you could, you wouldn't just sort of

46:09.360 --> 46:11.480
dump that investment in the Unity 8 design.

46:11.480 --> 46:12.780
You wouldn't just jettison it.

46:12.780 --> 46:16.740
You would somehow incorporate it in the future product.

46:16.740 --> 46:20.400
That is, to me, not as sustainable

46:20.400 --> 46:23.520
as having a light fork of Edwardia

46:23.520 --> 46:28.300
and then over the next, say, two or three releases,

46:28.300 --> 46:30.040
carefully iterating it.

46:30.040 --> 46:33.040
That, to me, seems to be a, I don't know,

46:33.040 --> 46:35.120
a more sustainable approach, you know what I'm saying?

46:35.120 --> 46:37.800
Like something that, it will take longer

46:37.800 --> 46:39.600
but it would work much longer.

46:39.600 --> 46:41.520
It's something that's usable much longer.

46:41.520 --> 46:43.160
Yeah, I think the argument is that

46:43.160 --> 46:45.960
it requires a significant investment

46:45.960 --> 46:49.600
and one of my favorite quotes from a design article

46:49.600 --> 46:52.300
was, you know, design's not something you sprinkle

46:52.300 --> 46:55.320
on the top like a little bit of je ne sais quoi

46:55.320 --> 46:58.200
as a junk grid pissing down an alleyway.

46:58.200 --> 47:01.280
You know, it's just like something you just throw on there

47:01.280 --> 47:02.400
like, ah, whatever.

47:02.400 --> 47:03.720
Yeah, I suppose so, yeah.

47:03.720 --> 47:06.280
It's, you've gotta invest in it and cultivate it

47:06.280 --> 47:09.080
just as much as you care about the actual meat

47:09.080 --> 47:10.840
of the code of the applications.

47:10.840 --> 47:12.680
And I think that's the thing, is people wanna see

47:12.680 --> 47:14.540
that it's invested and cared about

47:14.540 --> 47:16.680
and not like an afterthought.

47:16.680 --> 47:19.680
And I know that those guys actually do really care

47:19.680 --> 47:21.360
about that stuff, I think that it just needs

47:21.360 --> 47:22.720
to be communicated that way.

47:25.460 --> 47:27.320
I suppose, Eric, you have a good point.

47:27.320 --> 47:29.260
Eric in the Mumble Room says, well, look,

47:29.260 --> 47:31.240
this is like the definition of not,

47:31.240 --> 47:34.540
this is the definition of anti-not invented here.

47:34.540 --> 47:36.120
Right, Eric?

47:36.120 --> 47:39.860
Right, I mean, for years, Canonical was that company

47:39.860 --> 47:42.640
that if it's not built here, then we're not using it.

47:42.640 --> 47:44.800
You know, I mean, that's very reminiscent.

47:44.800 --> 47:47.360
Or at least that was, I think, the impression, yeah.

47:47.360 --> 47:49.960
Right, I mean, that's, right, yeah, exactly.

47:49.960 --> 47:51.160
That was the impression.

47:52.480 --> 47:56.040
But I mean, how is reaching out to the community

47:56.040 --> 47:58.380
anything but being like an apple

47:58.380 --> 48:02.000
who embodies that completely?

48:02.000 --> 48:04.440
I mean, here, why don't you be a part of this thing?

48:04.440 --> 48:07.400
Why don't you help us create icon themes

48:07.400 --> 48:10.400
and wallpapers or whatever the case may be

48:10.400 --> 48:12.840
and be a part of this product?

48:12.840 --> 48:15.360
Be a part of, you know, 1804.

48:15.360 --> 48:19.760
Hmm, so I guess we probably really just have

48:19.760 --> 48:21.680
to kind of leave it here, it seems to me,

48:21.680 --> 48:23.600
unless anybody else has any closing thoughts on it.

48:23.600 --> 48:24.780
It seems like we just leave it here

48:24.780 --> 48:26.220
and we just wait and see what happens,

48:26.220 --> 48:28.560
but good point, everybody.

48:28.560 --> 48:33.560
Just one extra point, I think it's because people

48:34.800 --> 48:36.960
often are going a little bit back

48:36.960 --> 48:39.480
on the notion between code or design,

48:39.480 --> 48:42.200
which team should actually get contributions,

48:42.200 --> 48:46.120
is that if you pick up a pen and a little bit of paper,

48:46.120 --> 48:48.040
try to draw something, you'll probably see

48:48.040 --> 48:49.440
that you failed miserably.

48:49.440 --> 48:51.880
And it's hard for you to actually have that notion

48:51.880 --> 48:52.840
when it's about code.

48:52.840 --> 48:56.760
So people often think that they're gonna get crappy design.

48:56.760 --> 48:59.200
And so they tend to value and think that the only way

48:59.200 --> 49:02.080
is by actually acquiring talents

49:02.080 --> 49:04.160
and having the company do so.

49:04.160 --> 49:06.700
And the other point on for recommendations,

49:06.700 --> 49:09.600
like when it's like getting actual feedback

49:09.600 --> 49:13.360
from the community, it has been the inconsistency

49:13.360 --> 49:17.040
that makes Canonical's voice a little bit kind of low.

49:17.040 --> 49:19.560
And in that way, community responds

49:19.560 --> 49:22.760
not with an open heart immediately.

49:22.760 --> 49:25.960
It takes a good amount of time until they actually,

49:25.960 --> 49:29.280
okay, feel more, okay, they are actually being honest here.

49:29.280 --> 49:31.020
It's not just another move.

49:31.020 --> 49:34.660
It's not gonna change in a couple of weeks type of thing.

49:34.660 --> 49:37.240
Yeah, and that could be something that changes over time,

49:37.240 --> 49:38.080
don't you think?

49:38.080 --> 49:39.120
Don't you think that's something

49:39.120 --> 49:41.920
that will ease over time potentially?

49:42.760 --> 49:43.960
I think yes.

49:43.960 --> 49:47.240
As long as the management is done in such a way

49:47.240 --> 49:50.640
that actually fixes problems that existed before.

49:50.640 --> 49:54.200
As a developer, I had once a really bad experience

49:54.200 --> 49:56.080
when I actually spent time investing

49:56.080 --> 49:59.180
in a piece of technology that Canonical did invest in,

49:59.180 --> 50:01.960
and then just bang, disappeared.

50:01.960 --> 50:06.840
And that experience, if you have that over and over,

50:06.840 --> 50:08.180
you don't come back, right?

50:08.180 --> 50:09.020
Yeah, yep.

50:09.020 --> 50:11.120
And it's one of those things, you have to be resilient

50:11.120 --> 50:13.840
and you have to kind of do smooth transitions.

50:13.840 --> 50:15.480
And I think they're doing that now.

50:15.480 --> 50:18.000
I hope they continue with that path.

50:18.000 --> 50:18.840
Well said.

50:18.840 --> 50:22.600
So I wanna move us on because I still wanna talk about DRM

50:22.600 --> 50:25.000
because I think that's sort of a super important topic.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.920
And there's been some major developments this week,

50:26.920 --> 50:29.880
but I do wanna do just a quick bit of followup

50:29.880 --> 50:32.240
and go back to last week's episode, if we could.

50:33.200 --> 50:37.920
And the CEO of, you guys remember we talked about Linus,

50:37.920 --> 50:39.500
the auditing tool last week?

50:40.560 --> 50:43.120
And it was Sysify, is that how we decided?

50:43.120 --> 50:45.520
C-I-S-O-F-Y, Sysify?

50:45.520 --> 50:47.400
Yeah, that sounds right.

50:47.400 --> 50:50.400
Michael is the CEO there, and he pinged me and said,

50:50.400 --> 50:52.080
hey, just a couple of extra bits of information

50:52.080 --> 50:57.080
about Linus, it just hit its 10 year birthday this month

50:57.360 --> 50:58.680
as we happened to just randomly cover it.

50:58.680 --> 50:59.520
That's awesome.

50:59.520 --> 51:01.640
That's super awesome, dude.

51:01.640 --> 51:04.720
And also, Linus can run as an unprivileged user.

51:04.720 --> 51:07.840
In the episode, I decided to run it with sudo.

51:07.840 --> 51:09.160
But he says, if you do that,

51:09.160 --> 51:11.120
if you run it as an unprivileged user,

51:11.120 --> 51:13.160
the report is just stored in slash temp.

51:13.160 --> 51:14.920
And I really appreciate it.

51:14.920 --> 51:18.440
He also said that some of the plugins are completely free,

51:18.440 --> 51:20.800
and there are indeed others that are commercial.

51:20.800 --> 51:22.480
They're built by companies.

51:22.480 --> 51:24.880
He says, also, we advise using a cron job

51:24.880 --> 51:27.800
with daily comparers for easy detection of new findings.

51:27.800 --> 51:32.240
And he linked to a linux-audit.com article for that.

51:32.240 --> 51:33.600
If you didn't catch last week's episode,

51:33.600 --> 51:34.480
I definitely recommend it.

51:34.480 --> 51:36.120
We talked about Linus, a tool where you could

51:36.120 --> 51:38.800
audit your own system and see what's changed,

51:38.800 --> 51:40.440
see what's going on with that.

51:40.440 --> 51:41.840
How's the Gentoo challenge going over there?

51:41.840 --> 51:44.100
I see, I have a whole bunch of things happening

51:44.100 --> 51:45.000
right now on the screen.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.040
I don't even know what these are.

51:46.040 --> 51:47.720
What are we seeing build right now?

51:47.720 --> 51:48.640
What is this?

51:48.640 --> 51:51.720
Right now, we are updating the world set.

51:51.720 --> 51:55.960
So Wes Payne over there, Mr. Wes Payne, son of a bitch.

51:55.960 --> 51:57.360
He's the one that, I don't know if you guys,

51:57.360 --> 52:00.360
if you've caught all of the episodes of Linux Unplugged,

52:00.360 --> 52:04.840
as we were wrapping up, just a couple episodes ago,

52:04.840 --> 52:06.040
it wasn't that long ago,

52:07.880 --> 52:10.240
Wes suggested that we do a Gentoo challenge.

52:10.240 --> 52:12.760
And so what we have done is we have created

52:12.760 --> 52:14.560
a virtual machine here in the studio

52:14.560 --> 52:17.680
that is building Gentoo right now as we record this episode.

52:17.680 --> 52:19.400
And that's what you're looking at

52:19.400 --> 52:21.040
if you're watching the video version right now

52:21.040 --> 52:22.560
of the Unplugged program.

52:22.560 --> 52:24.120
If you're listening to the audio,

52:24.120 --> 52:27.360
AKA if you're the majority of the audience,

52:27.360 --> 52:30.360
just envision a lot of GCC crap going across the screen

52:30.360 --> 52:32.360
and you've basically got it.

52:32.360 --> 52:34.920
So I just wanted to give a mention for two reasons.

52:34.920 --> 52:36.560
One is a completely selfish reason

52:36.560 --> 52:37.780
and the other is because I just love

52:37.780 --> 52:39.280
talking about these events.

52:39.280 --> 52:42.820
And I can't help but talk about them.

52:42.820 --> 52:44.680
Texas Linux Fest is coming up

52:44.680 --> 52:46.720
and they have their call for papers right now.

52:46.720 --> 52:47.680
So it's gonna be in June.

52:47.680 --> 52:49.760
So you got a little bit of time to plan for this.

52:49.760 --> 52:51.680
It's gonna be at the AT&T Conference Center

52:51.680 --> 52:53.480
in Austin, Texas.

52:53.480 --> 52:56.100
And they have a whole range of topics,

52:56.100 --> 52:58.560
but they have their call for papers right now.

52:59.680 --> 53:01.000
This is their eighth year.

53:02.800 --> 53:03.680
And they've never been.

53:03.680 --> 53:04.520
I thought it was-

53:04.520 --> 53:05.620
It seems like a lot of fun.

53:05.620 --> 53:08.460
Could somebody tell me how many people go to this thing?

53:08.460 --> 53:10.240
How many people go to Texas Linux Fest?

53:10.240 --> 53:14.960
And is it June?

53:14.960 --> 53:18.160
Is it worth being in Austin in June?

53:18.160 --> 53:20.080
Like really, be honest with me.

53:20.080 --> 53:21.780
Is it, tweet me, at Chris Elias,

53:21.780 --> 53:23.320
is it worth being in Austin in June?

53:23.320 --> 53:24.160
It just doesn't,

53:24.160 --> 53:26.000
it feels like it's gotta be a really good event

53:26.000 --> 53:27.980
to be in Austin at that time.

53:27.980 --> 53:30.040
And then just a little PSA

53:30.040 --> 53:34.200
before we wrap up the community news segment this week.

53:34.200 --> 53:37.720
You Fedora users, to pay attention just for a moment,

53:37.720 --> 53:40.840
Fedora 25 has entered the end of life status,

53:40.840 --> 53:43.440
aka no more updates for you,

53:43.440 --> 53:47.400
in just about a week from when you hear this episode.

53:47.400 --> 53:49.240
So now would be a really good time

53:49.240 --> 53:53.000
to upgrade to Fedora 26 or maybe Fedora 27.

53:53.000 --> 53:53.840
Yeah.

53:53.840 --> 53:57.040
Fedora 26 should be really solid right about now.

53:57.040 --> 53:58.600
And 27's getting there.

53:58.600 --> 54:01.520
And your upgrade should probably go pretty smooth

54:01.520 --> 54:03.440
if you have a pretty straightforward system.

54:03.440 --> 54:06.640
My upgrades have gone smooth for many releases now.

54:06.640 --> 54:11.080
Fedora 25 will be DOA in just about two weeks.

54:11.080 --> 54:14.560
So upgrade to Fedora 26 or 27 now if you're a Fedora user

54:14.560 --> 54:16.640
because your time is running out.

54:19.400 --> 54:21.360
We need to have like an end of life theme.

54:21.360 --> 54:25.320
Like if somebody wants to make us an end of life clip,

54:25.320 --> 54:26.320
I'll play it on the sound board

54:26.320 --> 54:27.920
for like distros that go end of life.

54:27.920 --> 54:30.080
Because I think we should just have like a segment

54:30.080 --> 54:31.340
like if you're running this version of Linux,

54:31.340 --> 54:32.560
you're no longer getting patches.

54:32.560 --> 54:33.400
If you're running this version of Linux,

54:33.400 --> 54:34.240
you're no longer getting patches.

54:34.240 --> 54:35.520
Yeah, right, you can just follow this show

54:35.520 --> 54:37.000
and know when you need to update.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.340
There's no master list, right?

54:38.340 --> 54:39.720
So we should just put it all out there.

54:39.720 --> 54:41.480
Just let everybody know.

54:41.480 --> 54:43.520
I don't know, then I hear from people, maniacs,

54:43.520 --> 54:44.920
like I think maybe Joe or somebody.

54:44.920 --> 54:46.160
Somebody I know.

54:46.160 --> 54:48.400
I'm not gonna say it's Joe Resington.

54:48.400 --> 54:49.240
I'm not gonna say it's Joe.

54:49.240 --> 54:50.080
But it probably is.

54:50.080 --> 54:51.520
But it's probably Joe.

54:51.520 --> 54:54.120
I run like Ubuntu 14.04 or something.

54:54.120 --> 54:55.120
I know, I know.

54:55.120 --> 54:57.120
Just absolute, absolute animals.

54:57.120 --> 54:58.600
Absolute animals, just animals.

54:58.600 --> 54:59.520
I can't even understand it.

54:59.520 --> 55:00.700
I can't even understand it.

55:00.700 --> 55:03.440
Bashful, you had a comment about the funeral march

55:03.440 --> 55:05.700
towards old distros, go ahead.

55:07.720 --> 55:09.880
I was just gonna say, you wanted a sound clip?

55:09.880 --> 55:11.780
Just run the funeral march.

55:11.780 --> 55:12.920
Oh, I get it.

55:12.920 --> 55:15.760
You know like the brr, brr, brr.

55:15.760 --> 55:16.600
Bingo.

55:16.600 --> 55:19.920
I feel like we need something unique to the show though.

55:19.920 --> 55:21.400
You know, like some podcasts have people

55:21.400 --> 55:22.800
submitting clips all the time.

55:22.800 --> 55:23.640
Sound board stuff.

55:23.640 --> 55:24.460
For sure.

55:24.460 --> 55:26.120
I got an empty sound board right now

55:26.120 --> 55:28.240
and the only thing on the Linux unplugged sound board

55:28.240 --> 55:32.720
is the intro and outro theme and the flashback.

55:33.560 --> 55:35.420
I got the flashback harp, which I feel like is good, right?

55:35.420 --> 55:36.260
That's good.

55:36.260 --> 55:37.200
But I don't have anything more.

55:37.200 --> 55:39.000
So if you wanna help populate the new sound board

55:39.000 --> 55:40.560
for 2018, you can start sending clips

55:40.560 --> 55:41.680
into the unplugged program.

55:41.680 --> 55:42.520
It's gonna be full of.

55:42.520 --> 55:44.680
Is the bell not a part of the sound board?

55:44.680 --> 55:45.520
Well, it depends.

55:45.520 --> 55:46.340
Is that a real bell?

55:46.340 --> 55:47.180
Depends on the show.

55:47.180 --> 55:48.020
It depends on the show.

55:48.020 --> 55:49.440
You know, people ask, should I reveal?

55:49.440 --> 55:50.640
Do you guys feel like I should reveal

55:50.640 --> 55:51.960
if the bell is real or not?

55:51.960 --> 55:53.240
No, keep it a mystery.

55:53.240 --> 55:54.480
I'm gonna keep it a mystery.

55:54.480 --> 55:58.520
Cause I know some people have looked at the audio waveforms

55:58.520 --> 56:01.100
to try to determine if the bell is real or not.

56:01.100 --> 56:03.860
And I don't wanna say.

56:05.080 --> 56:06.320
I don't wanna say.

56:06.320 --> 56:07.240
You'll have to guess yourself.

56:07.240 --> 56:08.920
You can load this up in Audacity.

56:08.920 --> 56:10.800
Load this episode up in Audacity.

56:10.800 --> 56:14.280
And you take a look at it yourself.

56:14.280 --> 56:16.040
Digitalocean.com.

56:16.040 --> 56:18.560
Go over there to support the show, Digitalocean.com

56:18.560 --> 56:20.680
and use our promo code DOUNPLUGED.

56:20.680 --> 56:21.520
One word.

56:22.680 --> 56:23.720
That's it, one word.

56:24.600 --> 56:26.800
You get $10 credit over Digitalocean.com.

56:26.800 --> 56:30.160
Wes Payne is the perfect Digitalocean customer

56:30.160 --> 56:32.800
because every time I have a conversation with you, Wes,

56:32.800 --> 56:34.180
every single time you're like,

56:34.180 --> 56:35.880
you know, I could just do that on a droplet.

56:35.880 --> 56:37.240
Like I kinda had to actually.

56:37.240 --> 56:38.080
You know, that's true.

56:38.080 --> 56:39.080
I kinda had to argue with you

56:39.080 --> 56:41.400
to just load a virtual machine on your laptop

56:41.400 --> 56:43.160
to do the Gentoo challenge.

56:43.160 --> 56:44.000
Whoopsie.

56:44.000 --> 56:44.820
Cause you're like, you know,

56:44.820 --> 56:45.880
we could just do it on a droplet

56:45.880 --> 56:48.060
and then I could use the HTML5 console

56:48.060 --> 56:50.560
and then I could reload one of those rigs with Gentoo.

56:50.560 --> 56:52.400
Like, you had a whole plan.

56:52.400 --> 56:54.620
And I don't know, less than 55 seconds.

56:54.620 --> 56:57.160
Which, ironically, is probably how long

56:57.160 --> 56:58.720
it would take to spin up a droplet.

56:58.720 --> 56:59.560
You like that?

56:59.560 --> 57:00.380
I like that a lot.

57:00.380 --> 57:01.400
Digitalocean.com.

57:01.400 --> 57:04.600
You create your account, you use the promo code DOUNPLUGED,

57:04.600 --> 57:05.560
you get a $10 credit.

57:05.560 --> 57:08.180
Now, the rig that I love, my personal favorite,

57:08.180 --> 57:09.700
three cents an hour.

57:11.820 --> 57:14.160
Let me just let that marinate for a second.

57:14.160 --> 57:15.260
Three cents an hour.

57:15.260 --> 57:16.100
That's like nothing.

57:16.100 --> 57:16.940
That's nothing.

57:16.940 --> 57:18.320
It's like just walking around outside.

57:18.320 --> 57:21.080
I mean, you know, I'm not saying the burger comparison,

57:21.080 --> 57:24.560
I'm not saying the coffee comparison or the heroin or weed,

57:24.560 --> 57:25.400
whatever your habit is.

57:25.400 --> 57:27.240
I don't think people would get that.

57:27.240 --> 57:28.800
And I'm not saying if that's a soundboard bell

57:28.800 --> 57:29.720
or a physical bell.

57:29.720 --> 57:31.380
But what I am saying is you can get a great deal

57:31.380 --> 57:33.040
if you go to digitalocean.com

57:33.040 --> 57:35.440
and you use our promo code DOUNPLUGED.

57:35.440 --> 57:38.160
They got 40 gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors.

57:38.160 --> 57:39.400
Of course, the host machines run

57:39.400 --> 57:42.400
GNU slash Linux running KVM for the virtualizer.

57:43.840 --> 57:44.680
And they got Bloxorg.

57:44.680 --> 57:46.280
If you're basic and you just want something

57:46.280 --> 57:48.520
that shows up as a slash dev slash SD device,

57:48.520 --> 57:49.760
go with the Blox storage.

57:49.760 --> 57:52.680
That's what I do when I wanna have it as my home.

57:52.680 --> 57:54.920
So when I set up a DigitalOcean dropout

57:54.920 --> 57:58.280
that I'm gonna remote into and have like Ubuntu mate,

57:58.280 --> 58:01.000
I use Blox storage for my slash home.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.480
Now if I have a rig that I'm using for like web storage

58:03.480 --> 58:05.720
or additional files or sharing with co-hosts,

58:05.720 --> 58:07.880
that's where I use spaces or object storage

58:07.880 --> 58:08.800
with DigitalOcean.

58:08.800 --> 58:10.720
They have an API so when the machines during,

58:10.720 --> 58:12.180
for our production, I need to spin them up

58:12.180 --> 58:14.000
or shut them down, I do it all through the API.

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
I don't go to the website.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.360
Love it.

58:16.360 --> 58:19.320
And if you're in a project, if you're like a,

58:19.320 --> 58:20.400
maybe you're like, I don't know,

58:20.400 --> 58:21.720
just randomly gonna put this out there.

58:21.720 --> 58:22.680
Just a crazy idea.

58:22.680 --> 58:25.140
If you're in an open source project,

58:25.140 --> 58:27.360
you're working with some people,

58:27.360 --> 58:28.960
they got team accounts.

58:28.960 --> 58:29.900
Team accounts.

58:30.800 --> 58:32.060
They got team accounts.

58:33.720 --> 58:36.520
You can easily manage your cloud with your team

58:36.520 --> 58:38.500
by inviting others' team accounts.

58:38.500 --> 58:39.760
DigitalOcean.com.

58:39.760 --> 58:42.040
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED

58:42.040 --> 58:44.120
and take advantage of a $10 credit

58:44.120 --> 58:45.600
and enjoy spaces.

58:45.600 --> 58:47.240
I wonder, are they still offering that?

58:47.240 --> 58:49.680
Oh shoot, they're still offering, oh shoot.

58:49.680 --> 58:50.520
Oh!

58:51.800 --> 58:52.920
So here's what you can do.

58:52.920 --> 58:55.120
You go to DigitalOcean.com, you create your account,

58:55.120 --> 58:57.260
use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, you get the $10 credit,

58:57.260 --> 59:00.240
and then you go sign up for a two-month trial

59:00.240 --> 59:02.240
of spaces for free.

59:02.240 --> 59:03.080
It's good stuff.

59:03.080 --> 59:04.600
It really is good stuff.

59:04.600 --> 59:06.520
You know, the thing about DigitalOcean that strikes me,

59:06.520 --> 59:08.160
and maybe they should make this like their slogan

59:08.160 --> 59:09.000
or something, but.

59:09.000 --> 59:09.820
Go, S, go.

59:09.820 --> 59:11.160
It's easy enough for development.

59:11.160 --> 59:12.000
All right.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.420
You can spin it up like you said, API, super simple

59:14.420 --> 59:15.260
dashboard. Seconds.

59:15.260 --> 59:16.100
Right, seconds.

59:16.100 --> 59:16.920
You don't have to think about it.

59:16.920 --> 59:17.760
It's not difficult. Like serious CPU and memory.

59:17.760 --> 59:19.600
There's a big range of integrations.

59:19.600 --> 59:20.560
Bandwidth, seconds.

59:20.560 --> 59:21.400
Yeah. It's crazy.

59:21.400 --> 59:23.200
But it's stable enough for production.

59:23.200 --> 59:24.880
Like when you're ready to go full bore,

59:24.880 --> 59:27.680
putting it out there for the world, boom, no problem.

59:27.680 --> 59:29.560
Oh, boom, no problem.

59:29.560 --> 59:33.480
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED,

59:33.480 --> 59:35.520
and Godspeed.

59:35.520 --> 59:36.780
Go create some infrastructure.

59:36.780 --> 59:38.960
You know, I had a good comparison.

59:38.960 --> 59:41.360
That costs less per hour than long distance

59:41.360 --> 59:43.360
used to cost per minute.

59:43.360 --> 59:44.680
Wow.

59:44.680 --> 59:47.560
And also super solid old man reference.

59:47.560 --> 59:48.400
Yeah.

59:48.400 --> 59:49.240
Nice.

59:49.240 --> 59:51.160
DigitalOcean.com, promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

59:53.500 --> 59:58.360
So I used to be one of these guys who was

59:59.820 --> 01:00:02.500
not so concerned about the DRM.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.040
You just wanted your media.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.400
Then I went and watched a talk by this Cory Doctorow guy.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.240
This son of a bitch totally changed my entire position.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.200
He knows how to speak.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.600
It happened randomly too.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:19.160
And I have a vlog about it, not to be that guy,

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.040
but I have a vlog about it where I went there

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.400
and I saw the talk and I went, well shit,

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:26.100
now I completely changed the way I feel about this.

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:30.080
So I wanna frame our discussion here with what hit me

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.060
and what I walked away with.

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:39.400
And I think it helps us think about this DRM problem.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:43.520
There is a lot of inventions throughout humanity

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.800
that are really there because they were able to stand

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:49.320
on the shoulders of giants.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.160
We even have a saying for it.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.920
Standing on the shoulders of giants.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.400
And if you look at open source,

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.960
I mean that's what all of our open source desktops

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.080
are all standing on top of the frameworks

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:03.360
and libraries and kernels and stacks

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.320
that everybody else has built.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.920
Everything is standing on the shoulders of giants

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:08.920
that we rely upon.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.680
If you look at the internet, it's the same fucking thing.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.100
It's standing on the shoulders of giants.

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:22.120
And DRM locks it up.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.600
DRM locks up knowledge.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:30.180
It locks up intellectual property.

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:38.760
It makes it ephemeral.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:43.920
And it makes it something that's only available in the present

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.160
and something that is inaccessible

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.540
to future generations of humanity.

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:52.160
It locks up knowledge.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.600
It is the antithesis of the open internet,

01:01:54.600 --> 01:02:00.720
of open standards, of open source, of sharing knowledge.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:04.000
It's the antithesis of what the internet has brought us.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.560
This fundamental communications platform

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:11.000
that humanity can use to educate themselves and grow.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.640
DRM is the opposite of all of that.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.560
And the EFF has been fighting against DRM

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:21.400
and the laws behind it for a decade and a half.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:25.660
And things are not going well.

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:29.560
So Cory Doctorow, who I think is the premier thinker

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:34.740
on this topic, who holds talks that will change

01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:36.380
the way you think about this.

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:41.280
And he writes posts on the EFF's deep links blog

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.760
that will really make you think.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:46.040
And the headline is DRM's Dead Canary,

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.760
How We Just Lost the Web, and What We Learned From It,

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.640
and What We Have to Do Next, or What We Need to Do Next.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.360
And the thing about DRM is it's not

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.560
about copyright protection.

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.640
In fact, that's total 100% bullshit.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:05.640
That's used car salesman bullshit.

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.640
Everybody, and this is Cory's words,

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.840
everybody on the inside of the industry

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.840
secretly knows that DRM technology

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:14.400
is completely irrelevant.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.200
The technology is irrelevant.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.480
It's fundamentally flawed.

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.280
And I'll get into why.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.920
But it is fundamentally flawed.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:26.000
It is impossible to keep DRM safe.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:33.640
But DRM law is everything.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.800
And this is not a US-specific thing.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.680
The reason companies want DRM has nothing

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:49.600
to do with copyright, nothing to do with copyright at all.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.440
So let's look at Netflix, because it's just

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.400
an easy example.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.760
But there's so many other things beyond Netflix.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.440
DRM has so many other implications

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.120
besides online media.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.520
But it is the one that we think of.

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.020
And it's the easiest one to relate to.

01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:06.640
So let's go with Netflix.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.440
They send you an online streaming movie

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.280
that's been scrambled.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.200
And they want to be sure that you

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.640
can watch it and that you can even maybe save it

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.120
to your hard drive and play it back later.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.920
But they want to make sure it's protected.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:21.000
So they need to give you a way to view the movie at some point.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.920
That means they have to unscramble the movie for you.

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.800
And there's only one way to unscramble

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.500
a file that's been completely encrypted.

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.560
You have to use a decryption key.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:36.880
So Netflix has to also give you the unscrambling key.

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:38.520
But if you have a key, you can't just

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.560
unscramble the Netflix movies and save them to your hard drive.

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:48.160
So how can Netflix give you a key but control how you use it?

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:54.920
Netflix has to hide the key somewhere on your computer,

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:59.160
like in a browser extension, like an encrypted browser media

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.120
extension.

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.480
Hiding something really good, hiding something well,

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.440
is hard.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.920
Hiding something well in a place of equipment

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.640
that you give to your adversary to take away with them

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:16.960
and do anything they want to it offline is impossible.

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:23.320
Any tiny flaw in that fragile wrapping around these keys,

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.840
any tiny flaw that you can exploit, and they're free.

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.560
And once that flaw has been exposed,

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.480
anyone can write an app or browser plug-in

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:32.200
that has a Save button that can just exploit it immediately.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.280
And of course, they've seen this over and over

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.520
again with all kinds of different schemes.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.960
And Cory is writing this in a way

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.560
that maybe people aren't familiar with the situation.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.560
It does a really good job.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.520
But yeah, it's super good.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.800
Once the flaw is exposed, anybody can get access to it.

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.080
And this is a fact.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.080
The companies know this.

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:55.120
They can spend millions of dollars developing DRM.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:58.120
And it gets broken in days by teenagers or hobbyists

01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.320
with equipment.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:01.400
And it's not because DRM makers are stupid.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.820
They can have brilliant people making DRM.

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:07.680
It's because the idea is stupid.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.320
Trying to store a decryption key on a system

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:14.200
that your adversary controls is dumb as shit.

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:16.680
It's the dumbest thing you could do in security.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.560
Think about that for a second.

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:21.800
Trying to store the key to your system on a hacker's computer,

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.960
that's the stupidest thing you could do.

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.000
And that's what DRM is trying to do.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.360
So this is where the law comes in, Uncle Sam's law comes in.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:35.080
But the best thing is, it goes way beyond Uncle Sam.

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:38.040
It all comes back to your old buddy, your favorite,

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:41.480
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.560
In 1998, Congress passed that son of a bitch.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:47.880
And Section 1201 provides for felony liability

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:52.320
for anyone commercially engaged in bypassing a DRM system.

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.880
And get this, if you're commercially doing it,

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:58.200
you know, like some of these Kodi box manufacturers?

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:05.280
Five years in prison, $500,000 fine for your first offense.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.920
How many Congress people do you think

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.240
had actually used the internet when this law was enacted?

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:09.800
I know, right?

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:10.800
98?

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.920
Even non-commercial bypass of DRM is subject to liability.

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:17.920
And it also makes just even talking about DRM exploits

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:19.800
legally risky.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:22.320
And yet, use of Section 1201 of the DMCA

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.760
to threaten security researchers who discover flaws

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.560
is widely used too.

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.040
And the beautiful thing is, thanks

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:33.760
to US trade representatives, I mean, you know,

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:36.440
hurrah everybody, they've convinced other countries

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.480
around the world to adopt a version of this rule

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.000
as part of our trade policies.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.680
So you want to do trade with us, you

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.640
got to protect intellectual property.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:47.520
We don't even need some of these huge TPPs.

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:50.720
We just, if you want to work with us, you got to respect it.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.760
This is where the W3C comes in.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.160
These sons of bitches over the W3C

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.800
have really sunk us all.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.320
And this is where I think Linux users may

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:04.560
be able to eventually, it's not just Linux users, actually,

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.680
it's any platform users.

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.680
But I think it has to start with Linux users.

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.680
Could maybe change the tide, move the dial,

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:13.960
whatever stupid little saying you want to give it.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:19.080
But the W3C and the implementation

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.120
of EME, encrypted media extensions,

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.600
is really what enabled all of this.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.280
It was sort of the final straw.

01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:28.800
It was the straw that, you know, whatever the fuck.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.720
In 2013, Netflix and a few other media companies

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:35.680
convinced the W3C to start work on a DRM system for the web.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.920
This DRM system, encrypted media extensions,

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.800
EME represented a sharp departure

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.960
from the W3's normal business practices.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:48.080
First, the EME would not be a complete standard.

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.960
That's a huge deviation.

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:55.360
Second, the organization would specify

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.320
an API through which publishers, i.e.

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:01.320
businesses, large corporations, and browser

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:06.360
vendors, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla,

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.680
would make DRM work.

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:12.240
I want you to think about that for a second,

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:17.640
because that means you have to be on the approved list.

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.600
You have to be Google.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:19.280
You have to be Apple.

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:22.040
You have to be Microsoft to make this work.

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.600
The actual content decryption module, the CDM,

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.520
wouldn't be defined by the standard.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:29.280
That means that EME was a standard name only.

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.640
If you started a browser company and followed

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:35.160
all of the W3's recommendations, you still

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:39.280
wouldn't be able to play back a Netflix video.

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:40.400
That's the killer.

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:42.480
If you followed all of the W3 standards

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.720
today, you wouldn't be able to play the video.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.120
That's not a fucking standard.

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:47.280
It's not an open web.

01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:48.560
That's not a standard.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.080
That's not a standard, right?

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.920
You have to get Netflix's permission

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.200
to play back that video, regardless

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.320
of whether it's not a standard.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.720
That's not a standard.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.240
And that is a, oh, man.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:04.640
What it basically means is you are enshrining

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:09.920
the current browser monopolies, because you can't now

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.240
create a competitor to Chrome or Firefox.

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.040
Yeah, absolutely.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.520
And play back encrypted media extensions.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.880
It also twists things a little bit.

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.480
It's not like you and Netflix establishing a trust

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.120
relationship.

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.960
It's them and these companies you happen

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.160
to use as the middleman.

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.280
Right, right.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.360
My middlemans.

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.120
Yeah, you're right.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.760
That is also really creepy.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.360
In a web which every publisher gets

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:34.200
to pick and choose which browsers you can visit,

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:37.560
their sites, is very different from the historical web.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.800
I think we should go with the traditional web.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.000
The old days.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.160
Technologies that have stood in the way

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.800
of this permissionless interoperability,

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.460
for instance, patent-encumbered video,

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:49.760
have been seen as impediments to the idea of open web,

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.280
not standardization.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:54.000
Look at Flash.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.600
Steve Jobs's thoughts on Flash open letter,

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.200
iOS's refusal to implement Flash,

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:03.240
the really limp attempts to implement Flash

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.120
on Android that never went anywhere.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.920
Flash died not because we don't like it, but because of mobile.

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:10.600
Because mobile wouldn't do Flash.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.200
That's why Flash dies, is dying, right?

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.560
And now is essentially gone, is because mobile

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:16.840
refused to implement it.

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.280
Because it wasn't a standard.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:21.760
And now, thanks to mobile, projects like YouTube DL

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.800
allow me to download video from over 200 websites

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.800
because they're all trying to be mobile compatible

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.080
and they've got to serve this shit up as an H.264 file.

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.240
And this is the opposite of all of that.

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:37.640
This is actually the op- this is like enshrining Flash forever.

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:39.280
This is not Flash this time.

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.440
This time it's encrypted media extensions,

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.740
which each manufacturer, Netflix,

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:45.880
Hulu, they all get to brew their own now.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.380
This is the opposite of what the W3C used to be about.

01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:55.680
This is the opposite of what we used to expect from an open web.

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:59.040
When the W3C starts making technologies that only work

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.200
when they're blessed by a handful of entertainment

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.640
companies, they're putting their thumbs,

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:07.160
they're putting their fists on the scale in favor of ensuring

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.060
that the current browser giants get the majority

01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:13.740
and enjoy a permanent regime.

01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:15.400
How many times have you heard somebody say,

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.400
well, I use Chrome because it works with Netflix

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.400
before Firefox could?

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.040
You know, this has a lot of parallels

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.080
with the whole net neutrality thing that's going on now, too.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.560
That's interesting, you're right.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.920
It kind of does, doesn't it?

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.960
Yeah, it kind of does, only this is worse

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:37.920
because this is locking up intellectual content

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:41.160
and creative things that humanity has created

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.120
and wrapping them up in a DRM that is only accessible once

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.200
a certain vendor has blessed it.

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:49.720
And it's cute for modern day companies

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:53.000
that want to make a great profit and impress their shareholders,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.900
but what about 45 years from now?

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:57.240
What about 65 years from now when we want

01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.160
to look back at the classics?

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:02.200
Well, what if all that shit's wrapped up in DRM?

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.840
How does that impact humanity?

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.720
And I hadn't thought about this.

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:10.040
There seems to be an unavoidable harsh reality to me.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.600
The W3C wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't for WebKit

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.640
and Chrome's dominance.

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:23.200
If Mozilla Firefox was the predominant browser,

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.240
this is my personal opinion, but if they

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:28.280
were the predominant browser, if they had a 70% market share

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:33.240
right now, would we be getting this W3DRM encrypted media

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:35.920
extension standard rammed down our throats?

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.880
Or would they have to do something that was

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.240
open to the general web?

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.280
Something tells me things would be a lot different.

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:44.200
We're only in this position right now.

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.480
We're only getting screwed.

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:47.520
And it's not like we're getting a little screwed.

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.820
It's like humanity.

01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:52.800
It's like Disney on a whole new scale.

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:55.200
It's Disney for all of the content.

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:59.020
It's Disney's copyright imperialistic behaviors

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:00.880
for all intellectual property.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.240
For as long as the DRM technology is possibly valid

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.560
and these companies are around to ping a request,

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.360
this DRM is going to work.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.440
And it's going to screw over people

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.320
for years and years and years.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:16.200
And I don't feel like this would be possible if Firefox

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.660
had 70% of the market share.

01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:21.040
Now, I say this completely understanding

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:24.120
that Firefox supports encrypted media extensions.

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:25.520
And I understand that they are.

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.440
But I feel like they had no option.

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:28.840
They didn't.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.320
They really didn't.

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.920
So when you think, what can we do, well, part of me

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.800
feels like what we could do is we could all

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.240
switch to the new Firefox.

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:39.960
It's pretty fucking great.

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:43.680
Firefox Quantum 57, I've been running it since it came out.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.560
It is faster than Chrome.

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.280
It just has less load on my system.

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.240
Like, I can load up Firefox and have

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:51.680
it load a whole bunch of tabs in the background.

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:55.000
And it doesn't feel like my system is doing anything.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.680
Like, it just feels like, I don't know.

01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:58.100
Like, I look at my cores, because I always

01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:00.880
have the little system stats up in the bar.

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:04.640
And my cores are just sitting there at nothing.

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:07.920
Meanwhile, I'm blasting through Firefox pages like a maniac.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.160
And all my tabs are loading up.

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:14.400
When I got like 16 tabs, 15, 10 tabs on Chrome that I close

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:17.920
and then it reloads, all my CPUs are pegged for a while.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.000
And I'm like, oh, awesome.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:19.800
Look at Chrome, man.

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:20.300
Look at that.

01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:22.120
It's multi-process, multi-core.

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:22.760
It's so awesome.

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:23.760
Really browse it now.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.320
Yeah, but now when I launch Firefox,

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.480
it does the same damn thing.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:31.360
It uses just a total, total, total, like 70% less

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.520
of the CPU.

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:35.080
I think it's getting pretty damn competitive.

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.240
And you look at, like, they're so serious about some

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:40.040
of the technologies that they're investing in that, like, Rust

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.840
is an ends to a means.

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:44.280
Rust, the programming language, is an ends to a means

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:45.780
to what they're trying to accomplish.

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:49.840
And Rust itself is a technological miracle.

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:53.460
So maybe now is the time, as Linux users,

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:54.960
we make the hard cut.

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:58.440
We start using Firefox, and we start advocating Firefox

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.200
like we advocate the Linux desktop.

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:01.800
And I think this is the key piece.

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:04.120
If we can advocate the use of Firefox

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:07.120
like we were able to advocate the use of the Linux desktop,

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.360
maybe over time we could start retaking a little bit

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:11.440
of that market share.

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:13.840
And you were so inspired, Wes, by the new release

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:15.280
that you ended up putting that shit on your phone.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:15.760
I did.

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:16.440
It's true.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.280
You maniac.

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.880
Are you going to set it as the default browser?

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.760
Right now I'm picking, but I think I will.

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:22.360
I think I will.

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.680
I've been kind of fiddling between them, but really.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:25.600
I might try it.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.920
Really?

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.720
Yeah, you get the sync going.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.960
It's a good time.

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:32.960
Mr. Daredevilin, you want to wrap us up on this topic

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.480
before we move on?

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:36.560
Yeah, so I actually think Firefox

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:40.280
is a little bit in just as bad position as Chrome

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:42.840
and as Google in here, actually.

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.640
They were just as much as pushing for the ORM.

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.960
The only big difference is Google

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.440
can decide to do whatever they want with Chrome,

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:55.440
and we could potentially attempt to override whatever

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.200
is being done in Firefox.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.920
Because of its more open dynamics,

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:03.040
we should be able at least to, by just injecting

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.040
contributors over and over, take actually more ownership

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:08.280
of the code and actually get that to a point

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:10.360
that we have to say.

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:13.160
Now, all those cases are difficult.

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:16.280
And this started way before we were talking about DRM.

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.840
It started when we started talking about Osm.js,

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.520
the WebAssembly.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:24.080
Because if WebAssembly starts being OK

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.680
and people were mostly, oh, because of the performance

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:29.520
was good, it meant that people were

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:32.040
willing to compromise with the ability of the JavaScript

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:36.320
code that runs in their browser in exchange of speed.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:38.160
That's actually when the problem started.

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.400
Not so much DRM and DRM, it's just as a consequence

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:42.000
of that, I think.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.120
And us actually wanting to use those services.

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:50.520
And just as a final point is, well, it comes down

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:53.440
to have a way to the browser work out

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:56.160
a sandbox that is isolated, that does

01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:59.600
run these DRM for this company and that other company,

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:02.320
that we can make sure that it's only that one.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:06.320
At least this should give us the option of, OK,

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.640
I want to access this service.

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:11.800
I already compromised to this service.

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:14.680
Now I'm actually allowing them to execute this code.

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:17.520
But at least it's isolated in that context.

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:19.440
That could be an implementation that

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:22.400
would be more OK with than maybe what's actually

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:26.280
been happening now where it uses more of the holistic system

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:30.000
because it requires that for the rendering and everything.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.160
Yes, it sounds like you're advocating for something

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:34.160
more trying to put the user back in control

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:37.840
rather than the system where we're left being, you know.

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:39.120
Absolutely.

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:42.560
Hard-like system is what I would really love to see.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.760
But that day is never coming, at least so far.

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:49.720
I have to just resign to cubes.

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:53.120
That's basically where I find myself.

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.440
I feel like Mozilla didn't really

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:58.080
have much of an option in implementing this stuff either

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:00.760
because if they didn't, then they're not

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.240
providing what their users want.

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.280
And then they're, by consequence,

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:07.360
going to lose market share.

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:09.200
Yeah, no, I think you're right about that.

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.080
And I think, Chris, you were spot on just

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.760
with the dominance of Chrome and WebKit.

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:17.160
And just like, how used are we to all the proprietary stuff

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.520
Chrome bundles in for us?

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.400
And we just use it.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.360
And it's like, it's useful.

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:22.320
Oh, yeah, I can cast to my TV, all these things.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.520
But it just really hits home that these

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:27.000
are things that are not open or are not part of the open web.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.580
Well, what I feel like is if there's

01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:32.840
anybody that can swallow rough edges or deal

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:35.440
with inadequacies, which really isn't even

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:36.840
fair to prescribe to Firefox.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.520
But if there's anybody that can, it's

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:41.560
Linux users who have come up through the bad years

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:42.920
of the Linux desktop.

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.920
And we're kind of like, I know I have.

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.040
I will just speak for myself.

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.680
But I've spent the last couple of years

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:53.580
just sort of kicking back, my hands behind my head,

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:57.680
leaning back in my seat going, finally, it's here.

01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:01.680
I've got the same proprietary crappy application

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:05.560
that everybody else has, no compromises.

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.800
I can do everything everybody else can finally

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:10.720
after all these years of the Linux desktop advocacy

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:14.280
and fighting for it, I am on application parity.

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:15.760
And that's what Chrome gave me.

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:19.160
Chrome gave me application parity with all the other mother

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.160
effers out there who have had something I haven't

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.480
had for all these years.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:27.000
But the reality is it's like Walmart.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.680
Walmart can be convenient as hell here in the States.

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:32.360
But the reality is you're killing other businesses

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.520
by using Walmart.

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:34.320
You know what I mean?

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.880
And it's time to start shopping with the independent mom

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.120
of pop shops.

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:40.360
And I feel like we as Linux users

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:42.920
are more equipped to do than just about any other type

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.480
of computer user.

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:45.600
That's my personal opinion.

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:53.120
I feel like if we could give the market share to Firefox,

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.840
even just another 10%, and build and advocate,

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.560
you go home on the holidays, maybe

01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:58.960
switch people back to Firefox.

01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:00.760
Yeah, absolutely.

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:01.820
Is that crazy?

01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:03.320
And I've seen a number of relatives

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:06.060
too running older Firefox versions that haven't updated.

01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:07.960
So that's also a good time to just go

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:09.600
get them all the new hotness.

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:12.060
And also Firefox seems to be making moves to double down

01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:14.040
on privacy concerns.

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:16.880
There is more things coming to Firefox in future versions

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.760
that are going to be pretty good,

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:21.160
isolating out tracking to each site gets

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.200
their own silo of information and things like that

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.760
that I think are going to be compelling,

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.520
not in their implementation details,

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.040
but in their overall approach.

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:30.040
They're going to kind of take the iPhone approach.

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:32.160
And we don't need to use the cloud services.

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.560
We just want to sell the individual product

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:37.040
and protect your data.

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:39.440
And I think that sales pitch could really

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:41.320
sell for the web browser.

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:43.760
Mozilla has a unique relationship with the web

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:46.080
and what their motivations are as a result, especially

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:48.960
compared to someone like Google, who obviously needs the web,

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:51.200
but has other motives in mind.

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.240
Mos and Rats, that's all well and good

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:56.640
until Walmart goes and purchases all the small mom and pop

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:57.640
shops.

01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:58.560
Dammit, Mos and Rats.

01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:59.560
Fair enough.

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:00.120
Shut up.

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:00.960
Dammit.

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:03.040
All right, well, before we get into the Gen 2

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.680
challenge for the week, let's take a moment and thank Ting,

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:07.640
talking about voting with your wallet.

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:09.380
This is a better way to do mobile.

01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:12.200
In fact, Ting recently posted on their blog

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:14.800
a super concise description of Ting.

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:17.000
Ting is a no-contract carrier that

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.720
offers pay-for-what-you-use rates,

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:24.080
as opposed to requiring customers to select a plan.

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:27.400
In this way, mobile isn't a high fixed cost.

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.640
A Ting customer's bill can vary with how much

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.040
they use each month.

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:37.600
As a result, the average bill on Ting is $23 per month.

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:41.480
And you can get started with a $25 promo code

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:45.080
if you go to linux.ting.com.

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:47.920
And I couldn't say it better than myself.

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:48.760
I've tried to.

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:52.400
In fact, it's so simple to explain

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.800
that it almost feels like you have to unexplain the way

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:57.080
the other competitors do it.

01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.240
It's just a smarter way to do mobile.

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.840
You pay for what you use, it has nationwide coverage.

01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:04.160
They have a CDMA and a GSM network.

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.560
And you can probably guess the towers

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:07.680
that those networks are.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:10.220
So you just pick the one that works best in your area.

01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:12.600
They got a control panel that you turn stuff on and off

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:13.320
as you need it.

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.240
They can get a SIM for like $9.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.360
It's even available on Amazon Prime.

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.160
I mean, it's just awesome.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.960
linux.ting.com.

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.760
It really is a better way to do mobile.

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:25.100
Whether you want to have a security device, my buddy Chase

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:28.560
from Unfilter, he has some Ting mobile devices,

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.920
SIM cards in his security cameras.

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.400
And they send him like, I don't know, like four pictures

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:35.160
a week.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:38.000
Well, why would you pay for like 20 gigs of data

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:38.720
That's insane.

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:42.220
When you're maybe using eight megabytes a week, right?

01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:44.200
And that's the perfect.

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:45.720
You can get that SIM card, and you

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.440
could put it in an Internet of Things device.

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.640
You could put it in a phone.

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:49.240
Oh, it's perfect.

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.160
You could put it in your daily driver.

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.880
The use cases are just all over the place.

01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.220
Because there's no contracts.

01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:57.320
There's no other termination fees.

01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:59.360
So if it doesn't work for you, just turn it off.

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.520
It's $6 a month for the line.

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.640
And then you can manage all the different features

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.520
through their dashboard.

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:07.160
I think it's perfect for people who really just,

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:09.940
where that expense is somewhat trivial,

01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:11.440
and you just need to get stuff done.

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.680
It's just the perfect backup internet connection.

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:14.640
Your main thing goes out.

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.800
You still need to go get those files and do stuff.

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:17.400
Boom, Ting.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:18.160
$6 a month.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.860
If you don't use it, that's all you pay.

01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:23.640
When I was doing just 100% IT contracting, I had,

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:26.200
Ting wasn't a thing then.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:26.960
The dark days.

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:27.840
I remember this.

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:31.840
I had a plan.

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.140
I almost won't even admit this.

01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:36.200
But you have to understand, I was billing $120 an hour.

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:37.840
So understand that.

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:42.800
I had a plan that was $120 a month that sat in my drawer.

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:46.520
Just for when I was traveling, or when my internet connection

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.560
went down, or for when I was at another client that

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.720
had crazy firewall rules, or I needed

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:53.880
to do external testing, that I just kept in my laptop bag

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.520
all the time, it was always powered on.

01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:59.160
And it was probably, I mean, I probably

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:02.960
used no more than one gig a month on that thing.

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:03.440
Wow.

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.120
Wow.

01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:05.580
I would do it so different now.

01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:06.280
So different now.

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:07.680
I got three lines now on Ting.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:08.760
Linux.Ting.com.

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:12.360
Go there, learn more, save $25 off a device

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:16.640
or off your first month by going to Linux.Ting.com.

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:21.720
Thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:24.680
So Mr. Payne over there has been installing

01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:26.480
Gentoo throughout the show.

01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:27.760
How's it going so far, Wes?

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.960
We're still compiling.

01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:31.480
So I'm checking in right now.

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:33.520
What are you building at this moment?

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:36.640
Same position we were from last time.

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:37.680
I'm sorry, what?

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:38.560
Yeah, that's right.

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.240
I'm sorry, what?

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:40.200
That's right.

01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.480
So you're saying I literally have nothing

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:42.000
new to talk about?

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:42.480
That's true.

01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.680
Yeah, we're just updating the world.

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:45.480
See, but the thing is, Wes, is I plan this whole segment.

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.720
This whole segment.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:47.640
Well, it's gone well.

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:49.920
So we've got all of our file systems formatted right now.

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:50.640
What did you do?

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:51.720
Did you go extend to four?

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:52.880
XFS.

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:53.840
Oh, really?

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.000
Atta boy.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:55.560
Why not?

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:58.120
I mean, I'm not trying to slub it here.

01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:59.600
No, XFS is my thing.

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:01.040
I really think that's the way to go.

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:01.520
Good job.

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:02.880
OK, so you went XFS.

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:05.280
Did you do like a home partition, or how did you?

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:06.680
Yeah, I was just keeping it pretty simple here.

01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.200
So everything's just one partition?

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:08.960
Yeah, just one partition.

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:09.640
Then you have a swap?

01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:11.120
I would never run a real system that way.

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:13.280
Do you have a separate boot?

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:14.280
No, not yet.

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:14.840
Really?

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.240
We might add that on there, but.

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:17.360
And you have a swap?

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:19.280
No, no swap either.

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.480
I didn't give it that much brand.

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:21.980
I wonder if you could do a swap file.

01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:24.240
You could do a swap file instead.

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:25.800
I'll probably add a swap file, yeah.

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:26.880
Yeah.

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:27.880
Hmm.

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:30.080
So what do you think, Beard?

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:31.580
Is this sort of unimpressive?

01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:33.720
I have an important forward-looking question

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:36.260
that is going to decide how long this process is going to take.

01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:37.040
Desktop environment?

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:37.720
Yeah.

01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:38.760
Yeah, I think we should talk about that.

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:39.680
That's a good question.

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:41.960
I chose not to do system D as the init system,

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:44.840
so open RC is where we're going with this.

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:47.160
I figured if we were doing the GEN2 challenge,

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.960
but just regular C, user land, all that stuff.

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:51.840
Fair enough, fair enough.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:54.400
So after this, we're going to get our use flags configured,

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:56.520
everything there, compile the kernel,

01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:58.040
and configure the rest of the system.

01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.960
I have a suggestion.

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:02.520
Well, I don't even know if I want to say this out loud.

01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:04.100
I feel like we should have talked about this off air,

01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:06.220
but I have a suggestion for the desktop.

01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:11.120
What do you think about the latest Enlightenment?

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.320
Oh.

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:13.160
Yeah.

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.920
And what about Wayland and the latest Enlightenment?

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:16.360
Do you want to try it?

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:17.240
That might be interesting.

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:18.760
Is this stupid?

01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:20.160
Here's the thing, we have enough time.

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:22.960
So people that are GEN2 users could let us know,

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.240
is this completely dumb?

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:27.360
Should we go in latest Enlightenment and latest Wayland

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:28.200
and just roll with that?

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:29.200
That might be fun.

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.040
Check it out.

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:30.880
That would be great.

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.760
That would be great, but I think we need the feedback

01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:35.520
because I don't want to do something

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.760
that's almost guaranteed to fail,

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.800
especially the thing is, this is in a VM.

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:40.760
What is the VM environment again?

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:41.600
A virtual box.

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:44.600
So that is an important factor here.

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.160
We got to remember the fact that we're trying

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:47.320
to do this in virtual box.

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:48.400
Right.

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.280
And I don't want the virtual box video driver to.

01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:52.920
Now I suppose if we, well, but there's a lot of compiling.

01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:54.960
I suppose we could, if we get it compiled,

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:58.240
I could then boot into it from my physical machine

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.320
for actually running the desktop.

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:01.160
That might be an option.

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:02.240
What kind of, did you do a VMDK?

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:03.760
What did you do for the disk?

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:06.440
Yeah, so it's, no, it's just a raw VHD.

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:09.160
Oh, so you would like rub that up?

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:10.600
Yeah.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:11.440
Rub that up.

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:12.280
I like that.

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:13.120
I'm going to use that term.

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:16.360
So, okay, so you would grub that up, boot into that,

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:20.600
and then we could VLC RTMP stream your whole desktop

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:22.360
to the OBS machine.

01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:23.280
Yeah, we could do that.

01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.920
Yeah, I don't see why not.

01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:26.320
If we could get enlightenment working,

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.400
then we could do enlightenment

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:30.520
with full 3D acceleration on the stream.

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:31.360
That would be pretty cool.

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:32.440
Oh, that would be beautiful, okay.

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:33.280
That kind of seems like.

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:34.760
That seems like the goal to aim for.

01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.400
That kind of seems like the way we should go.

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:40.720
So where do you want to go with this?

01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:43.760
What are you building specifically right now again?

01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:45.400
I was updating the world set.

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:48.460
Okay, when you're done, should this be bootable?

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:50.840
No, not yet.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.680
So we're not even.

01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:52.500
We're not even going to get.

01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:53.340
It's not bootable yet, no.

01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:55.120
We're not even going to get bootable in this episode.

01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:56.520
No, no, we're not bootable.

01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:58.400
Okay.

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.200
Come on, Chris, these things take time.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:04.840
This isn't just a story we're following, it's a saga, Chris.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:07.640
So this is why people go with these Gen 2.

01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:11.760
I was just looking at this branch of different Gen 2 systems,

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:16.120
these remixes of Gen 2.

01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.760
I think this is why people do this.

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:22.560
I can't believe I used to do this per server back in the day.

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.800
This is mind-numbing to think about this.

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:29.040
I mean, I must have had 35 Gen 2 servers back in the day,

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:30.920
maybe 40 servers.

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.680
And I used to do this on each one of them?

01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:33.600
That's crazy.

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:35.180
Well, the thing is you do them all in parallel,

01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:36.920
so it only takes the time of one.

01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:39.840
Yeah, and I definitely use the hell out of disk CC.

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:42.360
Disk CC allowed me to distribute the compiling

01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:44.680
across multiple systems.

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:48.400
And we are limiting this to one system as we build this,

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:49.640
so I guess that's a disclaimer.

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:50.480
That's true, yeah.

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:53.120
I mean, if you want the classic long,

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:55.360
forever compiling Gen 2 experience.

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:56.760
Not doing Plasma, dude.

01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:57.600
Yeah.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:58.440
No, I'm not doing it.

01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:00.920
That will take months.

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:02.960
I knew where you were going, and we're not doing that.

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:07.280
I think Enlightenment or, what else, Wes?

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:09.760
What would be your Enlightenment backup, XFCE?

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:12.880
Open box, nice and light.

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:13.720
That's true.

01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:14.540
LXDE?

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:15.380
Yeah, that might be fun.

01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:16.220
LXQD.

01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:17.040
Yeah, there we go.

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.360
I was actually thinking LXQD, yeah.

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:20.560
I was thinking, Mumbler, do you have any suggestions

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:23.720
of super minimal desktops to build on Gen 2?

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:24.560
I3.

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.600
I3, I3 would be a good one.

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:27.520
More awesome, yeah.

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:30.520
Yeah, I like I3, or Sway,

01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:32.880
if we're talking about doing Wayland.

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:33.840
What about Lumina?

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.080
Yes.

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:38.160
Interesting.

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:41.000
I think we should, okay, we need a poll.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.320
It needs to either be Enlightenment or Lumina.

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:46.520
I thought Sway would be interesting,

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:47.960
although we could talk about Sway at any time.

01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:50.520
Well, okay, I'm okay with three,

01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.080
I'm actually pretty open to a three-way

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:52.920
if you wanna do a three-way.

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:55.440
Yeah, we could always do multi-desktop configuration.

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:57.560
Well, no, no, I mean, we could do a three-way vote,

01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:59.240
and the audience could decide,

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.960
and whatever they pick, let's do that.

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:05.740
So I think we should, I'm gonna embed a straw poll

01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:07.760
in the show notes for this week's episode,

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:09.420
and we probably won't get a lot of votes

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:11.360
because we're way into the episode,

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.720
but I feel like I'll also drop it

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:13.760
in the chat room for the live stream,

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.160
but I feel like we'll do three options.

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:16.520
So it's Enlightenment,

01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:20.800
Sway,

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:23.420
and Lumina.

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.680
Yeah, well, the only thing I,

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.400
the only one I was, the only thing I wanted,

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:34.680
do we want it, instead of, well, no,

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:37.640
I feel like Sway, we should give a serious consideration.

01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:39.720
But we could also talk about it in the future.

01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.960
Yeah, I was just, I'm trying to think about LXQ.

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:45.960
All right, so let's do Enlightenment, Lumina, and Sway,

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:49.120
and we'll do a dedicated thing to LXQ in the future.

01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:49.960
That's the way to do it.

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:51.720
I think that's the way to do LXQ.

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.600
All right, so we'll put a link in,

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.640
or I'll embed it in the show notes.

01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:57.240
You go to jupiterbroadcasting.com,

01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:59.800
look for episode 225 of The Unplugged Program,

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:03.280
and then vote on which one you want us to go with,

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:06.640
and Wes will try to build that, I guess,

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:08.160
maybe next episode, maybe?

01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:09.000
Yeah, maybe.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.320
Do you wanna just leave this build going?

01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:12.320
Yeah, I think I will, yeah.

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:14.240
I'm composing the straw poll right now.

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:15.360
It'll be in the show notes,

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:17.400
and if you're gonna stick around for the post-show,

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:19.100
I'll let you guys vote that are listening live.

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:20.200
But I think that's probably where

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.540
we should leave it right now.

01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:23.100
I'm proud of you, you're going.

01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:24.760
I'm watching it right now, you're building the way.

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:27.280
I'm really, you're, how did you do this?

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:29.280
Is this a screen session, or what am I looking at here?

01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:33.440
Just, I logged you into the machine with T-MUX.

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:34.700
So you're watching it too over there?

01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:35.840
Yep. Ah, cool.

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:36.680
That's right, I am.

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.000
Nice, and then we're taking that,

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.240
and we're capturing that from an SSH session,

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.240
and putting that up on the live capture.

01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:43.880
We'll have some better methods in the future.

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:44.920
This was just last-ditch.

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.280
Yeah, well, we're actually,

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:47.920
it's actually kind of fun for us internally.

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:49.080
We're coming up with different ways

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:52.320
we could capture your Gentoo build over there,

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.340
because it's like, there's no X session.

01:32:54.340 --> 01:32:57.200
So there's not a lot of things we can work with

01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:59.360
to remotely capture that and put it on a video capture.

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:03.160
What was that terminal sharing thing?

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:08.160
ASCII Cinema, or Paiobu, or screen, or T-MUX, or teleconsole?

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:10.360
Yeah, what was the first one, Pobi?

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:13.720
ASCII Cinema, ASCII Cinema.

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:16.160
Right, right, right, right, right.

01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:17.920
That's for recording, not for streaming.

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:20.000
Yeah, it didn't seem to have a live stream option.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.960
Our thinking was we would kind of play

01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:23.480
with a couple of different options

01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:24.880
on the pre-show next week,

01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:27.240
and kind of dial in the one that works the best,

01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:28.600
and then just sort of use that.

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:31.200
So if you want to join us live next week,

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.400
go to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for that,

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.000
because that's probably what we'll be spending

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.440
the live stream doing,

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:38.120
is trying to figure out how to stream

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:43.000
a barely bootstrapped Gentoo system to do a live stream.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Beautiful. Yeah, I know, right?

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:45.840
But in the meantime,

01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:49.040
go to linuxunplugged.reddit.com to give us your feedback,

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.840
your thoughts, and all of that.

01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:52.080
We appreciate that.

01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:53.760
And your ideas on the Gentoo Challenge,

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:57.200
and please, please, please go to the show notes

01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:59.840
and vote on the desktop environment that Wes should deploy.

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:00.960
We need your votes.

01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:02.320
And if you want a little more Wes Payne,

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:04.640
you want a little more beard, you want a little me,

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:05.800
you know, just a little me,

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:08.160
go check out the most recent user error.

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:10.640
Shouldn't disappoint.

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:11.800
If you want a little more poppy,

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.720
you want a little more wimpy,

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.480
check them out at the Ubuntu podcast,

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:18.680
always delivering a solid performance.

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:20.920
And last but not least,

01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:22.600
check out the whole damn network

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:24.760
over at at jupytersignal on the Twitters.

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:26.320
Yeah, I said Twitters.

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:28.920
Deal with it, people, and we'll see you next week.

01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:31.840
We'll be right back.

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:14.520
Well, what do we call this one?

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:15.520
What do you call this thing?

01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:16.520
What do you call it?

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:17.520
JBtitles.com.

01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:18.520
Go there and vote.

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:23.240
And if you're in any of the chat rooms, Discord or IRC, please bang suggest.

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:29.200
But Eric, didn't you have, you had something we wanted to add to the post show, didn't

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:30.200
you?

01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.200
Eric, did I mute you?

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:32.200
No.

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:33.200
No, you're not muted.

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:34.200
No, it's not my fault this time.

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:35.200
That's okay, dude.

01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:40.120
I'm just going to give you your spotlight on a large Linux podcast, and you just go

01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:42.880
ahead and totally AFK, it's cool.

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:43.880
JBtitles.com.

01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:45.840
We did just keep on talking.

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.720
All right, so I need to finish up this poll.

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:53.320
So what should Wes install, right?

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:54.320
Don't you think that's the way to go?

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:56.360
What should Wes install?

01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:58.600
What are our options again?

01:35:58.600 --> 01:35:59.600
I'm sorry, I'm just-

01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:02.680
From architect, you should add DWM to that list.

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:03.680
Fuck you.

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:04.680
From Wes.

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:05.680
Enlightenment, Sway, and-

01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:06.680
Yes.

01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:07.680
Sway.

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:08.680
Plasma.

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:09.680
Sway.

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:11.680
No, plasma is not a fucking option.

01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:12.680
That looks cute.

01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:13.680
No, we're going to do that separate.

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:14.680
No, yes, separate.

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:15.680
Although I guess let them decide.

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:16.680
No, no, separate.

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:17.680
No, separate, separate.

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:18.680
Okay.

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:19.680
There was a third one.

01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:20.680
BST one.

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:21.680
Luminous.

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:22.680
Oh, luminous.

01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:23.680
Yes, yes.

01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:24.680
What is it called?

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:25.680
Lumina.

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:26.680
Oh shit, I just hit reload.

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:27.680
What desktop?

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:31.000
This is like Groundhog Day.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Should Wes.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I'm just going to say should Wes build, because that's really what you're doing, right?

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Yeah, you do.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000
No, not Enlightenment.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000
I hate it.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Sway.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Sway.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Okay.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Illumina.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Is it Illumina?

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Yeah.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Illumina.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Illumina.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Illumina.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Illumina.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Yeah, it's Illumina.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.920
Why do I feel like it's not Illumina?

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:54.280
I don't feel like it's Illumina.

01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:55.480
No A at the beginning.

01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:56.480
Just Illumina.

01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:57.480
Illumina.

01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:58.480
Illumina.

01:36:58.480 --> 01:36:59.480
No, no.

01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:00.640
No A at the start.

01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:01.640
Just Illumina.

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:02.640
Hmm.

01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:04.880
Okay, what do I search for to get that?

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:05.880
Because I'm doing Illumina.

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:06.880
Oh, oh, I see.

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:11.600
No, I'm not doing an A. I'm doing an I. That's what our...

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:12.600
I'm doing...

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:13.600
Yeah, so Illumina.

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:16.640
Oh, I really fucking hate that.

01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:18.560
I really don't like that at all.

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:21.080
Okay, so it's Illumina desktop environment.

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:22.520
That would be a good build, though.

01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:24.400
That would be a pretty quick build, right?

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:26.320
So that's pretty good.

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:29.280
Okay, so Illumina desktop environment is the appropriate name.

01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:31.680
I think we should use the full names.

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:32.720
And we should be specific.

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:33.720
Which version...

01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:35.680
Hey, Discord, IRC, can you help me?

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:40.440
Which version of Enlightenment specifically supports Wayland?

01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.520
Because it has to be that one.

01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:45.680
We could have also done Mate.

01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:48.160
No, I'm talking about Wayland here.

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.160
Oh, yeah.

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:50.160
Is Mate...

01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:53.760
The newest version should all support Wayland.

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.760
22, 21, shit.

01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:56.760
Wait a minute.

01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:57.760
Wimpy, I'm like...

01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:58.760
Drive by right there?

01:37:58.760 --> 01:37:59.760
You got whip braced.

01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:00.760
No, it doesn't.

01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:01.760
I love it.

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:02.760
I don't know why, but something...

01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:03.760
Wimpy, you're so polite.

01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:04.760
You know what?

01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:05.760
You're...

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:06.760
You obviously...

01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:16.680
You know what?

01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:17.680
I just love it.

01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:18.680
No, no.

01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:19.680
No, it doesn't.

01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:20.680
Good for you.

01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:21.680
Well, okay.

01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:25.480
So, if we're just doing Wayland, we shouldn't put Element...

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:26.480
Or...

01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:28.520
I guess I got Elementary OS on the mind.

01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:30.280
I have been thinking about...

01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:32.840
I have been thinking about, instead of going all in on 97...

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:35.000
Dan's evil mission is complete.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.720
Dan showing up here every single week has been making me think, like, oh, fuck, maybe

01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:38.720
I should just...

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:42.000
If I'm gonna go LTS, maybe I should just go Elementary OS, because my son's running that

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.560
already, and it's working great for him.

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:47.280
It's been working great for him for, like, two and a half years, so...

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.280
Yeah.

01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.280
Damn it.

01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:50.840
I blame Dan the rabbit.

01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:54.000
Okay, so Elementary OS is not what I'm thinking of.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.240
I'm thinking of...

01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:56.240
What is it?

01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:57.240
Lumina.

01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:58.240
Lumina.

01:38:58.240 --> 01:38:59.240
Lumina.

01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:00.240
All right.

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:01.240
I don't know why, though.

01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:02.240
I get those two confused.

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:03.240
So, we got Lumina desktop, Enlightenment, and...

01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:04.240
Sway.

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:05.240
Sway.

01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:06.240
Sway.

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:35.240
Sway.
