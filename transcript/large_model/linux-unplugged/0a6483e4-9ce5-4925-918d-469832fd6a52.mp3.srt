1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
There's this thing in the back of your mind

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,360
where you sometimes wonder,

3
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,100
I feel like computers used to be easier

4
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,400
or they were faster or you could do more with less space

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,820
and you always sort of kind of dismiss that.

6
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,680
The practical voice comes in and says,

7
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,280
oh, come on now, Chris.

8
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,120
Computers are great.

9
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,960
They do so much more.

10
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,000
They're connected to the internet

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,360
and they have richer content

12
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,000
and they're so much more sophisticated.

13
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,400
And I go, yeah, you know what?

14
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,660
Practical self, you're right, you're right.

15
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,400
But then you try out like Haiku OS,

16
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,020
which is, it's from an era

17
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,480
that almost feels like an alternative universe,

18
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,920
the way personal computers could have gone

19
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,760
and you realize that things may actually have been better

20
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,640
and they were way ahead of their time.

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,360
I didn't really expect to have this,

22
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,500
but it just hit me in waves

23
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,860
as I was trying out Haiku this week.

24
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,020
It is another way of doing computing

25
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,280
that I think was better.

26
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,680
Like they nailed it back then.

27
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,340
If BIOS or B-O-S, however you like to say it,

28
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,040
had gotten the user desktop share that Linux has today,

29
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,280
you know, something that's not substantial,

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,160
but it's respectable and sustainable.

31
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,880
If BIOS had achieved that back in the late 90s, early 2000s,

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,320
they would be the most advanced,

33
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,480
sophisticated operating system on the planet today

34
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,000
because where Haiku is at right now

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,640
is phenomenally mind blowing.

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,360
This is Linux Unplugged episode 269 for October 2nd, 2018.

37
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,360
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

38
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,000
that's post-test barbecue and pre-switching to HaikuOS.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,840
My name is Chris.

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,660
My name is Wes.

41
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,840
Hello, Wes.

42
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,800
We have a really fun episode today.

43
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,240
In fact, it was one of these special episodes

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,160
where I jumped on a train, took a ride down to Seattle

45
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,480
and met up with Wes in his home turf

46
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,920
so that way we could brainstorm about the show over lunch

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,760
and on the drive up.

48
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,640
At least that's our excuse.

49
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,480
Worked pretty well.

50
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,680
It did actually work really well.

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,760
Thank you for the ride, by the way.

52
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,660
That was great.

53
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,320
I really enjoyed it because I could work on the train

54
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,040
the whole way down and prep today's big, big show.

55
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,440
So coming up, we'll get into some community news

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,360
that I think is gonna peak your interest

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
and things that we should probably just keep an eye on

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,560
over the next few months.

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,280
Plus we'll look back at what some may say

60
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,160
was the heyday of computing.

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,240
When everyone hated Microsoft

62
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,760
and BOS was possibly going to be a thing.

63
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,800
And then we'll look forward now with the new release

64
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,320
that the Haiku project has just put out

65
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,160
after a really, really long time.

66
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,880
And we'll try to make the case for Haiku

67
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,920
and why you should care.

68
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,560
If you're sitting there thinking to yourself,

69
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,920
what's the point?

70
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,760
I hope we answer that today.

71
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,320
Then we'll give you an update on our ThinkPad T480s.

72
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,160
My thought on this is what's the point of doing a review

73
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,440
if you don't follow up after using it for a while

74
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,160
and tell you about some of the road bumps you've hit.

75
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,320
And some of these apply to multiple breeds of laptops

76
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,160
from several vendors.

77
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,720
So we'll get into that, do a little followup there.

78
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,600
Then we'll tell you about some of the new things we set up,

79
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,720
the VM environments that we're doing

80
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,000
and some of the tools we're using

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,440
to try to manage those VM environments on our laptop.

82
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,600
And then last but not least, a little bit of a tip.

83
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,440
We've talked a lot about the LVFS project.

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,120
Well, today we're gonna talk about doing LVFS the hard way.

85
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,840
So perhaps you're not a Gnome Shell user,

86
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,840
you don't have Gnome software.

87
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,480
How do you get all of those great firmwares

88
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,840
onto your machine and get your firmware updated

89
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,760
if you don't have Gnome software?

90
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,600
How do you do it?

91
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,420
I wanna know.

92
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,260
We'll tell you how to do it.

93
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,340
It's just a few couple of easy commands

94
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,720
that are probably already installed on your machine.

95
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,080
And you can update your firmware from the command line,

96
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,720
which is the proper way to do it.

97
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,240
It's the proper, come on, that's the proper way to do it.

98
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,400
Well, we can't go any farther though

99
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,760
without bringing in our virtual lug.

100
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,360
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

101
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,200
Hey, hello.

102
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,040
Hello.

103
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,860
Good morning.

104
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,700
Wake up and smell the coffee.

105
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,120
Ha, ha, ha.

106
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,360
We got a great turnout.

107
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,720
Brent is in there, Brandon is in there.

108
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,720
We have two Erics, Eric and Eric the IT guy.

109
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,960
Mr. KP, Mini-Mech, Ryan Sipes returns

110
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,400
for a second show in a row, and Sean's back too.

111
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,860
And Sean, you've been here for a while too.

112
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,580
So guys, thank you so much.

113
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,900
That Mumble Room is open.

114
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,000
You can find out more by just googling

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,200
Jupiter Colony Mumble, really.

116
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,360
There's a setup guide.

117
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,720
You just have to pass a mic check and have headphones,

118
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,320
learn how to use Push to Talk,

119
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,000
and you can join the conversation in the show.

120
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,480
Next week is gonna be 270.

121
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,320
What?

122
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,800
Be really awesome to have a great showing.

123
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,640
Yes, it would.

124
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,460
Come join us.

125
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,300
It's lots of fun.

126
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,480
We did do the test barbecue after last week's episode.

127
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,520
It went pretty well.

128
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,640
There was one dynamic situation that,

129
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,920
all in all, all things considered went pretty well.

130
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,560
Wes brought us a surprise sous vide,

131
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,360
but the sort of dynamic situation

132
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,160
that had to be dealt with was the brown bear.

133
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,000
You see.

134
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,820
Oh boy.

135
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,520
He, myself, not a big fan of the schnapps,

136
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,400
but brown bears recently discovered Rupplemintz,

137
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,460
which he's a pretty big fan of and it's pretty strong.

138
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,080
So we discovered the boundaries

139
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,780
of how much booze should be at the barbecue.

140
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,280
So we'll get that right on the next one.

141
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,480
It's an important thing to work out because,

142
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,240
well, the results could have been disastrous.

143
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,480
Yeah, everything went fine.

144
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,300
It all went good.

145
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,140
Only small damage.

146
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,980
We're healed now.

147
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,120
Had some good conversations though in the meantime.

148
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,240
Speaking of great conversations,

149
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,100
before we get into the community news,

150
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,400
I just wanted to put out there

151
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,800
that if you've been wondering, why was Chris gone?

152
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,640
What happened to him?

153
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,360
Why is he talking about himself in the third person?

154
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,180
All of that gets explained in this week's,

155
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,240
or last week's, I suppose, User Air,

156
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,940
episode 49, not dead yet, air.show slash 49.

157
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,080
I talk about my recent brush with death

158
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,560
and what happened to me while I was in Texas.

159
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,760
And then also we get into some bigger questions

160
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,760
about Windows affecting bare metal Linux adoption now.

161
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,720
And it's a pretty great episode.

162
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,920
The guys invited me on to tell my story

163
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,480
about my near brush with death.

164
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,740
And I had a great time hanging out

165
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,520
with Dan and Popey and Joe.

166
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
And if you've been wondering what happened,

167
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,520
I invite you to check out User Air, air.show slash 49.

168
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,920
But with that out of the way,

169
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,880
let's get into some community news.

170
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,520
I have had an interesting conversation

171
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,160
over the last week and a half with System76.

172
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,320
And they've released publicly now information.

173
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,740
It's just a bit of a tease at this point,

174
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,280
but it's peaking my interest.

175
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,560
Posted just recently on the System76 blog,

176
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,820
they announced, quote, System76 is releasing

177
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,740
a new open source computer available

178
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,280
for pre-order next month.

179
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,160
Hmm, really now?

180
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,680
Yeah, yeah, an open source computer.

181
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,160
Yeah, okay, well, so their CEO, Carl,

182
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,720
posted a few days ago on Twitter

183
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,560
that at this week's Open Hardware Summit,

184
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,560
they'll be showing off this soon-to-be-released

185
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,560
open hardware desktop, and it might be called Thelio.

186
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,440
Yeah, it looks like it will.

187
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,680
And there's not a ton of details yet.

188
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,800
We know that System76 has been spinning up a warehouse

189
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,120
where they're gonna build their own systems.

190
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,920
But you're left with a lot of questions.

191
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,560
And I'm kind of a naturally skeptical guy.

192
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,600
So it's like, is this x86-based?

193
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,940
Is this gonna be a RISC computer?

194
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,240
Because really, you'd have to go RISC-V to go,

195
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,400
I mean, I would think.

196
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,800
Or is this something about the binary blobs

197
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
will be required to run it?

198
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,320
Like, what is the definition of fully open source here?

199
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,760
What does that mean?

200
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,560
And I haven't gotten a clear answer from them,

201
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,720
but I did get an invitation to go out

202
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,020
and visit towards mid-November-ish, I'm not quite sure,

203
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,060
somewhere in the November month,

204
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,480
to actually see the machine in person.

205
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,040
So I'll be able to see it with my own eyes

206
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,900
and see if it boots and what it is.

207
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,520
But I think this is a pretty exciting opportunity

208
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,900
because they're in a unique position

209
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,040
to deliver on something like this.

210
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,360
And it is obviously gonna resonate with a core audience

211
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,560
that they are already well-established with.

212
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,960
So there's a lot of possibilities here,

213
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,400
depending on how free this thing is

214
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,600
and if they're able to live up to expectations, I think.

215
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,480
Right, these are goals that we talk about all the time

216
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,760
that we wish, you know, when we're reviewing laptops,

217
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,120
these are things we complain about.

218
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,740
But what does it actually look like?

219
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,000
It does seem like they're having a lot of fun

220
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,500
setting up all their facilities to make this thing.

221
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,320
So people just get to have fun

222
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,640
playing with their new hardware.

223
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,000
It's an unbelievable, mind-boggling,

224
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,440
honestly panic-inducing investment, if you think about it.

225
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,720
Carl must be a brave man

226
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,880
because they had a very nice office in Denver

227
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,120
and to move all of the operations into a warehouse

228
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,000
and then really be learning how to set this thing up

229
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,360
and how to manage a warehouse,

230
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,120
while at the same time also trying

231
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,120
to get new products spun up,

232
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,560
I get overwhelmed at the idea of how do I even lay out

233
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,880
a warehouse to manufacture computers?

234
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,120
Like that detail alone is overwhelming to me,

235
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,800
not even to consider the fact that I've,

236
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,880
it's this massive financial investment

237
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
for a business like System76

238
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,920
and moving your crew and having them set up

239
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,960
in a new location is a massive work culture change for them.

240
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,920
Like every single level, this is a very big gamble

241
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,020
and it could pay off very well for them.

242
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,360
It could position them as a particular kind of leader

243
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,520
in this market and it also could fail

244
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,080
to gain enough traction to make everything sustainable.

245
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,240
And it's not the only machine

246
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,000
they're gonna make out of this place,

247
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,840
but it is fascinating to watch

248
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,560
and I'm kind of glad they're the ones doing it

249
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,000
because I couldn't imagine anybody else pulling this off.

250
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,400
Right, it does seem to be like them living their values

251
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,600
to some extent and if a company is gonna do it,

252
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,140
well, System76 has talked the talk for sure, so.

253
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,520
Ryan, I'm not gonna put you on the spot.

254
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,280
I notice you're not tagging me in mumble

255
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,780
to say anything about this.

256
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,040
Do you have any thoughts in general on this topic?

257
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,760
Yeah, I think that it's a great company

258
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,400
and this has been a big goal of theirs for a while

259
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,400
and I know that everyone there is really excited to do it

260
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,120
and if somebody's gonna pull it off,

261
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,160
I'd love to see somebody who cares as much

262
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,880
about the open source ethos as they do

263
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,140
be the ones to do it.

264
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,040
You know, you could almost run for office with that answer.

265
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,520
That is a very good answer.

266
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,360
Be careful.

267
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,960
It's a safe answer but I know what you mean, I follow you.

268
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,940
All right, well, let's keep going.

269
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,760
Let's talk about something

270
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,060
that Haiku has apparently nailed already.

271
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,600
Oh, yes, okay, that is true.

272
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,040
Now, Chris, you might be familiar

273
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,200
with a little distribution known as Fedora.

274
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,040
Oh, yeah.

275
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Okay, well, then you probably know Fedora29

276
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,240
is right around the corner.

277
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,180
There's a lot of goodies coming out there,

278
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,220
including, well, you know, some of that work

279
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,040
they have done optimizing battery life.

280
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,400
One exciting thing I noticed,

281
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,520
Fedora29 is looking to provide

282
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,960
a flicker-free boot experience.

283
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,160
Flicker-free, you say?

284
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,480
Yeah, I mean, this is kind of the goal

285
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,320
we've been waiting for.

286
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,080
You get it on those other operating systems,

287
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,500
even some surprising ones,

288
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,640
but even with like fancy Plymouth setups,

289
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,840
there's still a little flicker left.

290
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,320
You know, it's one of those intangibles too

291
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,800
because you look at it and go, who cares?

292
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,360
You know, but then when you power up a system

293
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,400
and the entire process is smooth and flicker-free,

294
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,720
there is a intangible cohesiveness to it

295
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,480
that feels polished and complete

296
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,400
and the opposite of rough.

297
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,040
Like when you see it flashing,

298
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,220
it feels like you can kind of see

299
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,280
where the tape's holding it together,

300
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,120
like the little rough.

301
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,600
Exactly, yeah, the connection points.

302
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,280
Yeah, and I kind of commend Fedora

303
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,400
for just plugging away at this now

304
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,560
for what feels like a fricking decade.

305
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,280
But they've had a lot of curveballs.

306
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,640
You know, the premise of this long desired

307
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,600
fricker-free boot is to maintain the same resolution

308
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,420
and mode set from the system boot

309
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,320
through the desktop loading

310
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,160
without any of those unnecessary mode set operations

311
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,600
that will cause your screen to flash

312
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,840
or sudden graphics changes in order to provide

313
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,360
this whole smooth experience all the way.

314
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,400
Yeah, they've got a great video

315
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,240
showing you what it looks like

316
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,760
and it looks like what you see on other operating systems,

317
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,400
but that motherboard logo,

318
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,480
whoever you're system manufacturing,

319
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,360
well, it just stays on the screen

320
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,640
and then your operating system loads.

321
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,760
Oh, so they're doing it through an EFI frame buffer, really.

322
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,280
So it's not like they're putting a Fedora logo

323
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
up on the screen.

324
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,440
Right, now there may be some options to add,

325
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,580
let's say, additional overlay graphics on top of the logo,

326
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,240
but the whole idea and the work they've done

327
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,440
is that whatever the system has drawn at the very start,

328
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,120
you keep that buffer and then you just add things on top

329
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,420
or hand it off, let's say, to grub or to the kernel.

330
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,460
A lot of my machines, not all of them,

331
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,080
but a lot of my machines let you replace that logo.

332
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,040
So you could put a Fedora logo in there.

333
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,880
Perfect.

334
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,720
Or just screw with people

335
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,020
and put a Debian logo in there

336
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,560
so when they think they're putting their faces in it,

337
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,520
there's a lot of fun you can have with that.

338
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,160
There is a caveat to this story,

339
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,840
like many of these new shiny things,

340
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,680
there still is work that has to be done

341
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,680
to get this working with Radeon or NVIDIA drivers.

342
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,200
So it's Intel only at the moment.

343
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,960
Not too unusual there with that,

344
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,240
but from the unusual department,

345
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,660
this is a big secret that we've heard rumors about,

346
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,120
I think we covered them back in March on this show,

347
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,600
so don't tell anybody about this one.

348
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,040
The cone of silence.

349
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,860
All right, now that it's just us kids,

350
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,800
Google is working on bringing game streaming

351
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
to the Chrome browser,

352
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,440
and this could have massive implications for desktop Linux.

353
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,600
All of the other places out there like TechCrunch

354
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,020
and The Verge are talking about Chrome OS,

355
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,200
but screw Chrome OS.

356
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Think about desktop Linux in general,

357
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,520
because you know this is gonna be a feature

358
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,400
that lands in Chrome.

359
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,880
I mean, we're talking about H.264 decoding,

360
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,920
some super fancy input management.

361
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,680
We're talking about technologies

362
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,040
that are gonna be a general stack

363
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,780
that gets baked into Chrome itself.

364
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,680
When you take just the native library of Steam,

365
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,560
plus now what you can do with Proton

366
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,760
or what you will be able to do in the future,

367
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,380
and then you combine it with this Google Stream project,

368
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,200
where it's gonna probably be

369
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,220
a whole nother category of games,

370
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,180
we may be months away from just about every game

371
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,800
being available to Linux.

372
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,560
The year of the Linux gaming desktop?

373
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,600
Well, it's really the year of the Chrome gaming desktop,

374
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,760
if this is true.

375
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,760
Google this week unveiled Project Stream,

376
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,080
and while Google calls this a technical test,

377
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,140
pay no attention, we all kind of see where this is going.

378
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:20,000
It's a test to see how well streaming a game to Chrome works,

379
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,200
and it's clear that this is a foundational technology

380
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,360
for game streaming service in general.

381
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,480
So far, they've partnered with Ubisoft

382
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,880
and are giving a limited number of players access

383
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,680
to Assassin's Creed Odyssey

384
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,680
for free for the duration of the test.

385
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,980
It's U.S. only.

386
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,200
You have to be able to handle 25 megabits per second,

387
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,520
and you have to be older than 17 to participate,

388
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,680
and you have to have an Ubisoft account

389
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,020
and a Google account.

390
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,200
I don't know if I have an Ubisoft account,

391
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,040
but I'd make one.

392
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,720
So you could sign up already.

393
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
I did, perfect.

394
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,560
Have you tried it?

395
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,380
Are you gonna sign up?

396
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,220
Oh, I already did, yeah, of course.

397
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,720
We probably all did, really.

398
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,880
I'm not so sure about this.

399
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,720
I am not as much of a doubter

400
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,880
as I think most of the audience is about streaming games.

401
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,680
I've tried several.

402
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,600
Nvidia has their own service

403
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,920
that works fantastic on the Nvidia Shield,

404
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,280
and I've played many games on that,

405
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,160
just tried it out for like three months,

406
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,000
and never really had any issues.

407
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,360
I've played games I've been wanting to play for ages,

408
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,520
but just was never gonna install Windows to play them,

409
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,720
and they were great.

410
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,240
As long as they worked okay with a controller,

411
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,200
they were great.

412
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,640
This, by the way, this setup,

413
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,400
will require that you hook up a controller

414
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,240
to your Chromebook.

415
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,080
Oh, interesting.

416
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,400
Or your machine learning Chrome.

417
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,960
They say either a PlayStation controller or an Xbox.

418
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,440
It does seem like it's gonna work better

419
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,040
for some classes of game.

420
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,800
Various games are more or less sensitive

421
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,520
to different input latencies,

422
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,360
so maybe it's not gonna be the best for your FPSs,

423
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,320
but it's exciting.

424
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,160
Do we want to moan about how big and bloated

425
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,120
Chrome is getting?

426
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,280
I mean, a game streaming engine in this thing now.

427
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,400
They've got remote desktop capabilities.

428
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,280
It really is a platform with a browser included.

429
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,240
I am curious, has there been discussion of,

430
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,320
obviously, it seems like right now

431
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,480
they're just donating all the compute and GPUs

432
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,200
to do this in the cloud somewhere.

433
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,040
Oh, it's gonna be a pay service.

434
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,600
So yeah, what is that gonna look like?

435
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,840
How much would you pay for that

436
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,200
if you didn't have to get a Windows box?

437
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,360
You know, if you look at Google's history,

438
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,660
oh, that's a good way to put it.

439
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,500
You're right.

440
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,160
This could save you even a Windows license.

441
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,520
Right, because you could set up a gaming machine

442
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,260
and do like the Steam streaming, for instance,

443
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,320
if you wanted to now.

444
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,160
I would say the way Google's gonna do this

445
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,420
is they're gonna bundle it with some other service.

446
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,560
Like, you know how they have YouTube Premium now,

447
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,260
and then when you get that,

448
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,840
you also get Google Music with it and things like that.

449
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,620
They'll bundle, I bet.

450
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,160
That could be one way they do this.

451
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,760
You could discharge separately for the service,

452
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,960
but I'm trying to think,

453
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,400
I can't remember the name of that gaming service.

454
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,320
On Live, I think it was?

455
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,160
Yeah, I can't remember it.

456
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,460
On Live.

457
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,940
They couldn't make it sustainable.

458
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,380
Think about the overhead with this.

459
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,020
You have to have racks and racks and racks

460
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,200
full of machines with monster GPUs

461
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,320
with incredible network performance

462
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,120
with huge CDN connections.

463
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,600
Like, this is not a cheap operation.

464
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,400
Even if you have 500 users,

465
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,200
just think about the load of 500 users

466
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,320
playing high-end 1080p, 60 frames per second,

467
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,240
Assassin's Creed.

468
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,760
That's a big job for a data center.

469
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,720
Google does have a pretty big head start, right?

470
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,560
They've already got...

471
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,400
They're probably one of the few

472
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,760
that has an infrastructure to do this

473
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,920
at a massive million user scale.

474
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,680
See, On Live ran into just run costs.

475
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,200
They couldn't charge enough.

476
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,360
Plus, they kept running into the issue

477
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,940
of the game publishers also wanted a ton of money

478
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,080
for every time somebody played a game,

479
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,120
and they had problems just porting the games

480
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,640
to some of the requirements of their platform.

481
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,280
So to do this at a scale,

482
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,960
you almost have to be making money

483
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,200
on the infrastructure with other things.

484
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,600
And then the gaming is something you can afford to do.

485
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,120
It can't be like the only thing that makes you money.

486
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,960
So they've got the infrastructure in place

487
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,440
for all the other Google services.

488
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,360
They've got the bandwidth to the homes.

489
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,280
They've got some of their own fiber that they own.

490
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,960
And they've got the compute.

491
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,840
So it seems like they could probably charge

492
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
eight to 15 bucks a month,

493
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,020
and you get access to a huge gaming library

494
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,480
right in your Chrome browser.

495
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,320
And you hit full screen,

496
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,520
you don't even know you're in Chrome.

497
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,360
Now, the question is,

498
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,000
do we trust Google of all companies

499
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,560
to run a service like this for a long time?

500
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,020
Like, is this gonna be a test that they do once,

501
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,400
and then nothing happens?

502
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,760
Maybe if we knew more,

503
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,420
if we could just know more about what they're doing here,

504
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,860
like Ryan points out,

505
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,480
wouldn't it be great to have the details?

506
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,540
Yeah, I was just thinking about the fact

507
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,760
that we don't really know how this is running

508
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,020
on their infrastructure.

509
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,320
And you talked about OnLive.

510
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,880
Did OnLive have a Windows license

511
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,480
for every instance that ran a game?

512
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,720
Is this using Proton?

513
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,640
Is this doing something else entirely?

514
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,120
I'd be really interested to know.

515
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,480
Yeah, I wonder too, since they require controllers,

516
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,320
they could be the console version somehow,

517
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,260
although very doubtful.

518
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,960
You're gonna want them in a PC platform, I would think.

519
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,880
We'll keep an eye on it, as we do.

520
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,120
It gave me the thought that maybe I should consider

521
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,760
getting a Chromebook, now that they can run Linux apps,

522
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,360
and soon they'll be able to stream games,

523
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,400
and they have a Samba file browser in them.

524
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,920
Be part of the Zeitgeist, Chris.

525
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,520
Well, I feel like maybe I have a blind spot all of a sudden.

526
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,320
You know, like I'm not really following that.

527
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,240
No, I don't use them, I don't have one, but I'm curious.

528
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,200
Let's go back in time a little bit.

529
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,500
These days, the conversation around Microsoft

530
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,000
is how they've embraced open source,

531
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,760
20,000 developers on GitHub.

532
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,640
They just released DOS as open source on GitHub.

533
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,280
I think, what was it, MIT license, I can't remember.

534
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
But no pull requests.

535
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,120
No pull requests.

536
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,940
No, thank you.

537
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,780
No pull requests.

538
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,240
But the conversation's really shifted.

539
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,000
Azure is dominated now by Linux.

540
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,640
Their workload on Azure, or Azure,

541
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,360
is 50% to 60% Linux boxes now.

542
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,640
Visual Studio Code is a massive project.

543
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,560
.NET Core, PowerShell Core, all open source projects.

544
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,400
TypeScript.

545
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,240
Huge, yeah.

546
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,080
Really huge.

547
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,960
And so, there is an understandable kind of cock-the-head,

548
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,800
why do so many Linux users still hate Microsoft?

549
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,440
And if you go back in time, all is revealed.

550
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,280
And October marks the 20th anniversary

551
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,920
of the Halloween documents.

552
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,360
In October of 1998, a confidential Microsoft memorandum

553
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,240
on Redmond's strategy against Linux

554
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,740
and open source software was leaked.

555
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,600
And it's sort of just gone away.

556
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,600
Now, this represents, in my view, a tactical Microsoft.

557
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,880
One that was looking at a new threat to its business model

558
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,320
and being honest with what its advantages were.

559
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,720
And I'll give you a couple of examples here.

560
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,880
So, here's some key quotes from their analysis of Linux.

561
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,040
So, they say, the Linux OS could become,

562
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,640
in a sense, the next Java VM.

563
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,320
And that sounds weird, but they were kind of right.

564
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,160
I mean, back in the mid-90s to late-90s, Java was huge.

565
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,960
And now, Linux runs everywhere,

566
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,880
even on Windows, just like Java.

567
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,400
So, they were kind of right.

568
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,440
It has kind of become the universal platform.

569
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,720
Couple of other things they noted

570
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,040
in these Halloween documents,

571
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,460
which was so controversial back in the time.

572
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,380
How could they say this?

573
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,460
Here's one.

574
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,260
An advanced Win32 GUI user would have a short learning cycle

575
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,360
to become a productive user under Linux.

576
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,200
Oh, boy.

577
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Here's another one.

578
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,240
Consumers love it.

579
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,520
Yeah, they do.

580
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,360
That's it right there.

581
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,480
That's a pull quote from the memorandum.

582
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,900
Using today's server requirements,

583
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,480
Linux is a credible alternative

584
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,880
to commercial developed servers

585
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,140
in many high-volume applications.

586
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,360
That seems to be interesting.

587
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,480
They also note the effect of patents and copyright

588
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,760
in combating Linux remains to be investigated.

589
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,360
So, there is a couple of interesting quotes in here,

590
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,440
but what I read is a strategic plodding Microsoft

591
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,680
that hasn't accepted where things are going yet,

592
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,640
because this is the 90s.

593
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,240
They haven't seen anything like this before.

594
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,380
Right, was trying to wrap their head around this.

595
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,620
But it caused such an outrage in the community

596
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,360
that a bunch of anti-Microsoft camps came up.

597
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,880
And there is a lot in these memorandums,

598
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,360
including doing damage control,

599
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,760
where Microsoft develops an emergency response team

600
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,640
to cope with Linux conversation announcements,

601
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,840
I'm sorry, conversion announcements,

602
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,040
and people announce they're converting their systems

603
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,960
over to Linux, Microsoft would create a strike team

604
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,520
to try to help mitigate that.

605
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,480
There's some good stuff in there,

606
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,140
including the Get the Facts campaign,

607
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,480
which really got people riled up.

608
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,320
Do you remember that?

609
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,560
I forgot about that, oh!

610
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,560
Yeah, yeah, the Get the Facts campaign

611
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,800
and the total cost of ownership, which really riled up.

612
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,960
Gotta have that TCO.

613
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,600
How dare Microsoft talk about the total cost of ownership

614
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,720
when we're offering a free operating system for life?

615
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,040
You know, it was just great.

616
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,000
And it really puts you in that mindset of the 90s.

617
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,800
And it was fun to revisit,

618
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,040
but you really can see how things have changed,

619
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,980
how far things have come.

620
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,440
Well, not everything.

621
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,800
Some things may have been better in the 90s.

622
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,880
I hate to be that guy.

623
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,080
So let's go with the 2000s.

624
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,040
In fact, let's go with March 2000.

625
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,960
In March of 2000, one of the best operating systems

626
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,880
ever released to humanity came out.

627
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,040
And it was called BOS R5.

628
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,460
It was the final version of BOS from B Incorporated.

629
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,340
It came in two varieties, professional and personal.

630
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,920
And this was the release that I got my hands on.

631
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,580
It was also the first release of BOS for the x86 platform

632
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,920
and made freely available to download.

633
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,720
So check, check, check for me, right?

634
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,560
Ooh!

635
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,400
You would download it or you could order a CD-ROM.

636
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,360
And if you did that, it would ship with legal encoding

637
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,840
and decoding for MP3.

638
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,920
On a live CD, a live CD.

639
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,760
So it was a very well-designed operating system, I felt.

640
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,700
But my bias was I didn't grow up with DOS in the home

641
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,040
or Unix in the home.

642
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,360
After the early computer era,

643
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,260
after like the trashes and the early consoles,

644
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,960
I jumped on a Mac because my mom was a graphic artist.

645
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,920
So she got herself an old-

646
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,760
That makes sense.

647
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,520
This is like the black and white days of Mac OS,

648
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,020
like Mac OS system one.

649
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,660
Or it's just, I don't know what it was called back then.

650
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,600
And it had some simple advantages to it.

651
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,620
If you wanted to extend the operating system,

652
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,520
you would take an extension file

653
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,640
and you would drag it into the extensions folder.

654
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,400
And if you no longer wanted that functionality

655
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,920
or it conflicted with something else,

656
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,920
you would just go into the extensions folder

657
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,080
and you would move it out.

658
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,900
And then it would no longer,

659
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,320
your system would no longer have that.

660
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,860
If you wanted to install an application,

661
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,480
you would just drag it into a folder and it was installed.

662
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,640
There was a simplicity to it.

663
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,820
If you needed to get access to your hard drive,

664
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,800
you could just plug it into another Mac.

665
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,500
It would mount right there on the desktop.

666
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,440
You could move files around.

667
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,640
You could even copy over the system folder, reboot,

668
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,380
and now boot off of that system folder

669
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,280
that you just copied over there.

670
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,040
It was remarkably simple,

671
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,820
but yet pretty sophisticated for its day.

672
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,940
It also had a lot of issues.

673
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,880
It wasn't properly threaded.

674
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,000
It crashed all the time.

675
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,360
But an intrepid group built BOS

676
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,000
around some of those same concepts.

677
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,280
But they built it to be multi-threaded

678
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,920
at a ridiculously fundamental level.

679
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,160
And they created a file system

680
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,620
that even Redmond had to dream about,

681
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,360
something that was database powered.

682
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,880
They created a system that was powerful,

683
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,280
very fast, very stable,

684
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,440
Unix-like in a lot of ways,

685
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,240
but simple in a Mac OS classic way.

686
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,720
But unfortunately, they just weren't successful.

687
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,680
They just couldn't really be sustainable.

688
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,880
And you do wonder what things would be like

689
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,640
if they had been successful.

690
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,300
And that's where the Haiku project comes in

691
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,680
and brings us all something wonderful.

692
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,200
If we can take an afternoon or an evening

693
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,600
just to play with this free software.

694
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,680
And they finally released another beta release.

695
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:10,880
Yeah, it's been, well, almost six years since Haiku's last release.

696
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,440
Yeah, November 2012.

697
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,440
That's kind of too long and it makes you worry about a project.

698
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,320
But after all that time, there are a ton of new features

699
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,640
and we have a brand new beta.

700
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,240
Haiku is really now its own project.

701
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,760
It's a continuation of the philosophy and themes of BOS,

702
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,880
but mostly it's its own thing now.

703
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,760
But it does still have some of that heritage.

704
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,880
For example, it has two flavors, 32-bit and 64-bit.

705
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,800
The minimum requirements are an Intel Pentium 2 or AMD Athlon,

706
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,760
256 megabytes of RAM, and you need at least an 800 by 600 screen

707
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,880
and they recommend three gigs of storage.

708
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,360
I think I got that.

709
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,880
Now, their 64-bit version, they recommend an i3 at least

710
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,680
and two gigs of RAM and 16 gigs of storage.

711
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,120
But some of the things they've introduced in Haiku

712
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,440
are delightful now.

713
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,440
They've introduced Haiku Depot, which

714
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,920
is probably the biggest change in the way

715
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,960
that you work with Haiku.

716
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,520
They have a legitimate package management system

717
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,800
and Haiku Depot sits on top of that.

718
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,600
And it's very easy to use.

719
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,640
Lots of cute applications in there, as in QT.

720
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,520
It's nice.

721
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,680
And pretty fast, pretty complete too.

722
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,920
And it matches it with a command line.

723
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,920
But the cool thing is, like the Mac Classic,

724
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,760
some packages are merely activated.

725
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,200
They're not installed.

726
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,760
And that, unlike the Classic Mac,

727
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,840
means you can do even more with Haiku.

728
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,320
The bootloader has been given some capacity to affect them.

729
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,320
So you can now boot into a previous package state,

730
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,880
like say you have a bad update, or you can even

731
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,520
go in and blacklist an individual file, which is just

732
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,600
stored in a settings file.

733
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,000
So if you want to mount the BOS drive from another system,

734
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,400
you can go in there, blacklist an individual file,

735
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,600
plug the hard drive back into the machine, boot up.

736
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,760
It's done.

737
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,960
That's fantastic.

738
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,680
We don't really have that feature now.

739
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,480
No.

740
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,960
No, and of course, it's got all the other kinds

741
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,960
of nice advanced features too, like disk transactions

742
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,160
for managing packages.

743
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,040
Not only does it do it there, but it's all transactions

744
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,840
written to the file system.

745
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,920
You can thus also manage installed package sets

746
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,800
on non-running Haiku systems.

747
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,560
And accompanying the package manager

748
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,440
is a massively revamped port system

749
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,560
that has moved from an organized array of build scripts

750
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,040
to a well-oiled, full-fledged port street,

751
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,000
containing a wide variety of both native software

752
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,080
and software that's getting ported to Haiku.

753
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,680
It's a good list of stuff in there too.

754
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,200
It really is.

755
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,080
I mean, you can use it too.

756
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,320
It has Wi-Fi support.

757
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,560
They've borrowed the network stack from FreeBSD,

758
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,800
so you've got all kinds of networking goodies in there.

759
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,680
And here's another example of cleverness.

760
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,720
Haiku's native remote desktop application is slick.

761
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,800
Unlike VNC or other bitmap-based protocols,

762
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,680
Haiku's remote desktop forwards the drawing commands

763
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,040
from the host system to the client system, which

764
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,480
for most applications, and pretty much all of them

765
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,360
except for video, consume significantly lower bandwidth.

766
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,240
It's similar to how pre-compositing X11 operates,

767
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,480
or it's pretty close to how Microsoft's RDP operates,

768
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,320
where you don't send the bitmaps,

769
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,920
you send the draw commands, which are just commands,

770
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,200
and then the client actually does the drawing locally.

771
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,360
You don't need any special server.

772
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,200
As long as you have SSH access, you can do this.

773
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,000
And you get a native client included with Haiku,

774
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,220
but there's also an HTML5 client you

775
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,040
can run in any web browser.

776
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,000
And we've had some fun with it.

777
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,080
We tried it out on this Dell that

778
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,480
will be the precision laptop that we're

779
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,800
going to try to review next week.

780
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
We were going to review it this week,

781
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,840
but we're going to try to review it next week.

782
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,200
We loaded on that with the 4K screen.

783
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,880
And I also put it under virtualization on my Lenovo,

784
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,400
which I'll talk more about my virtualization setup.

785
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,880
But I was pleased to see that they

786
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,720
have made modifications to the new release

787
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,640
to support virtio, bus, and drivers.

788
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,560
So it works pretty great under QEMU and KVM.

789
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,920
I did have to make a slight change to actually have

790
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,120
the mouse input work well.

791
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,400
So if you want to try out Haiku and you just

792
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,840
want to run it under VM, it'll work pretty good.

793
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,160
It's snappy, yeah.

794
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,500
But if you're using like Virt Manager and your mouse

795
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,000
is jumpy, go into the details of the virtual machine

796
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,200
that you have Haiku installed, go to Add Hardware,

797
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,440
and then Input, and then add an EV Touch USB graphics tablet.

798
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,280
And the reason why you do this is it

799
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:20,280
forces Virt Manager to operate with an absolute mouse

800
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,200
resolution instead of like a guesstimated mouse resolution.

801
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,400
Because it thinks maybe you're dealing with a tablet

802
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,560
or something, I don't know.

803
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,920
And that made my mouse nice and smooth under Haiku under VM.

804
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,380
So if you want to try it, that's the way to go.

805
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:32,960
So it's nice.

806
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,000
It's really, really nice.

807
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,160
But you might be wondering what's

808
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,240
really so great about it besides the simplicity, the speed,

809
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,960
the stability, and really the cleverness of it.

810
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,920
Yeah, I already run a Tiling desktop on my Linux computer,

811
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,400
Chris.

812
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,320
What am I getting here?

813
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,680
What are you getting here?

814
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,080
Well, eventually, someday, maybe, no.

815
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,580
Actually, what you see is, like I was talking about earlier,

816
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,040
it's almost an alternative universe of the way computing

817
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,220
could have been.

818
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,120
And you can't help but observe just how far ahead of everyone

819
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,960
they were.

820
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,320
And they're able to pull off some stuff that we still

821
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,960
haven't nailed down in Linux.

822
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,460
Like, for example, Haiku has a series of kits.

823
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,960
And it's all explained in the B-book,

824
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,600
which we'll have linked in the show notes.

825
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,960
But they have an application kit, a device kit, a game kit,

826
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,240
an input server kit, the mail kit, the network kit.

827
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,640
These are all essentially kits that are

828
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,320
starting points for developers.

829
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,160
The application kit, for example,

830
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,160
is classes that establish an application

831
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,960
as an identifiable entity, one that could cooperate,

832
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,640
and then also tells it how to communicate

833
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,300
with other applications, all described in the application

834
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:40,800
kit.

835
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,280
If you want to connect an input device to Haiku,

836
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,720
there's a device kit that describes

837
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,820
how you build that for Haiku.

838
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,120
And it's all out there, everything

839
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,040
from how the windows should be drawn on the screen

840
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,040
to the way they should look to how you communicate

841
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,680
with the network stack or draw OpenGL on the screen.

842
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,560
They have all of it out there for developers in a clear,

843
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,920
documented, communicated way that's

844
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,280
been stable for years now.

845
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,600
Yeah, like imagine if MSDN was actually helpful and included

846
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,960
and in a book on your OS.

847
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,560
Just right there in a bookmark that you could just go read.

848
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,960
It is really smart.

849
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,380
The things they've thought about,

850
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,760
you have to wonder why they haven't taken off.

851
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,520
And that's why, after all this time,

852
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,400
after being failed in the early 2000s,

853
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,680
that's why people are still excited about this.

854
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,900
Because it is something that is truly unique,

855
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,600
and you can actually put your hands on it.

856
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,400
You can use it.

857
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,000
Yeah, it's a living entity.

858
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,500
I mean, yes, you can virtualize it, but you can boot it.

859
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,000
We got it booted, and we plugged it

860
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,540
in a mouse and the keyboard, and it worked.

861
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,840
You can get Wi-Fi working if you have just the right hardware.

862
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,400
So you can get a feeling for the ideas here.

863
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,860
And I think there are still some ideas

864
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,360
that we could stand to use.

865
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,680
We don't need to just leave this in the waste bin of history.

866
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,840
It's complete and integrated in a way that, I mean,

867
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,160
the BSDs explore this a little bit more,

868
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,060
but it's just so different from a traditional Linux desktop.

869
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,960
It was almost the future Mac OS.

870
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Apple, and I think this is one of the reasons

871
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,720
that B Incorporated failed, and you could probably

872
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,960
find out more if you just go read their Wikipedia page.

873
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,880
My recollection goes like this.

874
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,040
Apple was in serious negotiations

875
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,760
to use BIOS as the next Mac OS.

876
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,160
And that was until Steve Jobs came back

877
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,560
to the company, which brought along Next with it,

878
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,440
and then they based Mac OS off of Next.

879
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,200
But they were in early communications with B.

880
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,040
When Steve came back, the decision

881
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,280
hadn't been made to drop B yet.

882
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,920
And so while Steve was still interim CEO of the company,

883
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,120
they evaluated B, they tried to hire Linus,

884
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,400
and they evaluated Next.

885
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,800
And the issue really came down to is the people on the team

886
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,840
that had joined now coming from Next,

887
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,320
like folks like Scott Forstall, were familiar intimately

888
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,280
with how Next worked.

889
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,700
And so they had an internal team that just knew Next.

890
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,280
And so that was what they decided

891
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,160
to build Mac OS 10 off of.

892
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,280
It was almost BIOS, though.

893
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,800
It was almost BIOS for a time.

894
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,220
And if that would have happened, we

895
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,080
would have it in crap.

896
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,200
Of course, it would be locked down to Apple,

897
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,040
so it wouldn't be as exciting.

898
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,680
Because this, you can load on a brand new Dell Precision,

899
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,040
or you can load it on a Pentium system that's 32-bit.

900
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,800
So in a way, you get a lot more fun with it.

901
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,640
And after using it, I really felt,

902
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,400
I wish this was the operating system I could deploy

903
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,720
to friends and family who don't really like to use computers,

904
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,160
but use them as a tool, and strictly a tool.

905
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,940
They facilitate some singular purposes for them.

906
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,900
They need to do just something in the web browser,

907
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,760
maybe print something, maybe scan it most.

908
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,820
And they want a computer that just runs

909
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,020
and is very simple to understand.

910
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,520
This Haiku OS is so easy and simple

911
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,540
to understand that you begin to just instinctively navigate it

912
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,400
within five minutes of using it.

913
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,920
It's obvious.

914
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,320
It's non-offensive.

915
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,120
And consistent.

916
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,960
I think that's the other thing, right?

917
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,720
There's like a base set of abstractions,

918
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,240
and they're used everywhere, and they're all tied together.

919
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,700
Which is probably responsible from those kits.

920
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,920
And so that kind of thing, I think,

921
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,640
works really well for that type of user base.

922
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,720
And my hope for Haiku is that they get more people trying it.

923
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,600
Maybe they get more people into the project,

924
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,800
and they don't have to go so long between releases.

925
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,840
And maybe we could actually someday get a Haiku 1.0

926
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,160
that is deployable to end users.

927
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,440
Yeah, and there is a surprising amount of software

928
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
on there, things like LibreOffice, right?

929
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,140
You can get real work done.

930
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:35,280
Which was, for me, that was the killer thing for BOS R5.

931
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,640
When I was using it back in the early 2000s,

932
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,120
they did two things.

933
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,000
Is they let you install BOS from within Windows, which

934
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,880
was really high tech, right?

935
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,440
Especially back then.

936
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,280
The other thing that they had is StarOffice.

937
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:50,800
Remember that?

938
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,600
Remember StarOffice?

939
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,720
StarOffice.

940
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,760
Those are the days.

941
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,200
I was trying to advocate that my school district,

942
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,280
because I was an employee then, and I

943
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,600
saw the amount of money that we were spending on Microsoft

944
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,260
licensing, and I just said, let's use something else.

945
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,400
Let's use StarOffice.

946
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,480
And I was advocating at the time for StarOffice,

947
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,160
and I can't remember if I was actually by then.

948
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,360
I don't think I was pushing for the Linux desktop yet,

949
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,920
but I was like, we've got to stop paying these $300,000

950
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,280
Microsoft bills.

951
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,120
And that was just the tip of the iceberg.

952
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,440
And so StarOffice was like, that was my foot in the door.

953
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,440
I was advocating StarOffice.

954
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,120
And so when I saw that that was available for BOS,

955
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,120
I was a match made in heaven.

956
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,360
I had the main office suite that I

957
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,160
was trying to get everybody to switch to,

958
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,580
and I had a great desktop environment

959
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:37,040
that you could install on the existing x86 PCs.

960
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,600
Sounds a lot like Linux now.

961
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,980
And yeah, so there are some apps.

962
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,960
LibreOffice is out.

963
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,600
They have a web browser that is based on WebKit

964
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,000
that they had somebody work on, I think near full time,

965
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,660
as part of a Google Summer of Code.

966
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,960
They've gotten a few Google Summer of Code sponsorships

967
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,600
over the years, and that's helped out a lot.

968
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,160
But it's so neat, and it's really worth checking out.

969
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,920
It's not going to be your daily driver.

970
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,160
Ours gave it a go, and it didn't really work out so well

971
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,720
for the author over there.

972
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,480
It's pretty funny.

973
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,840
Sean Gallagher tried to use Haiku for a week

974
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,960
to get the job done, and it sort of failed on him pretty hard,

975
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,460
mainly around the browsers.

976
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,960
They just weren't able to do things

977
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,340
like some of the Google apps that he needed,

978
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,200
like Docs and Gmail just didn't work super well.

979
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,880
WebPositive was also the new browser, also not so great.

980
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,640
But he noted something of interest.

981
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,120
Of all things, the Swift programming language

982
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,980
has been partially ported to Haiku,

983
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,600
thanks to a Google Summer of Code effort.

984
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,440
I think they're working on Rust as well.

985
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,600
So hey, maybe some of the future apps

986
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,240
will run just native to Haiku.

987
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,840
Yeah, and OpenJDK was already ported.

988
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,960
So if you can put up with the email client that's

989
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,920
a bit bare bones, and the web browser that

990
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,320
won't support all the websites that you want to go to,

991
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,560
and limited applications, you might

992
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,760
be able to use it for a week.

993
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,240
But Sean Gallagher over at ours wasn't able to pull it off.

994
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,520
I didn't try.

995
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,620
I don't look at it as a, I don't think

996
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,920
it's fair to compare it to modern desktop Linux,

997
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,640
or Windows, or Mac OS.

998
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,880
It's more of like going to a museum that's

999
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,040
being refreshed and rebuilt. It's a historical adventure.

1000
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,560
You're going spelunking here.

1001
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,920
You're not trying to make it your new desktop home.

1002
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,880
But I got to say, if in another six years or so,

1003
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,760
they release something that is usable on the desktop with,

1004
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,720
maybe Firefox, like an actual Firefox browser or something,

1005
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,800
I'd be pretty tempted to give that a go again.

1006
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,040
I think they could really have something special there.

1007
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,400
So we'll have links in the show notes for all of that.

1008
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,560
You can see everything that we've tried,

1009
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,480
including some fixes to get it working a little bit better

1010
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,660
under virtualization.

1011
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,140
It's really easy to give a go.

1012
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,120
Yeah, it works great under virtualization.

1013
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,820
And you can just etcher or DD the ISO

1014
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,360
that they provide to a USB disk if you want to try it out live.

1015
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,840
So yeah, it's pretty neat.

1016
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,880
It's pretty neat.

1017
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,240
I want to now shift gears, though,

1018
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,140
and talk about these laptops.

1019
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,560
So we mentioned virtualization.

1020
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,640
I was doing it on my new T480.

1021
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,200
We did a review a couple of weeks ago.

1022
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,360
We got these new work rigs.

1023
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,160
They're identical, Wes and I. And so we did a review

1024
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,660
on the show.

1025
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,320
But I thought, after using it for about three weeks

1026
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,120
after that review, a couple of things

1027
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,040
have stood out that I would like to amend the review and include.

1028
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,000
And it's nothing that's a showstopper,

1029
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,400
so it's not a big deal.

1030
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,240
But for me, I'd have to say, in the not pleased category,

1031
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,600
I'm not so happy with the speakers.

1032
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,680
They're weaker than I'd like for serious work,

1033
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,280
like editing or recording a show.

1034
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,600
I'd be putting on headphones anyways.

1035
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,400
But I'd say if you're looking at getting

1036
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,320
one of these ThinkPads, one of these thinner, smaller ThinkPads,

1037
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,120
I've seen a couple of them now.

1038
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,920
Just don't plan to binge Netflix with them.

1039
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,160
You can hear your system alerts.

1040
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,120
You can make a call.

1041
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,160
It's going to work.

1042
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,320
I was watching some Netflix on here just this weekend, Chris.

1043
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,520
Were you underwhelmed?

1044
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,720
Well, I attached a Bluetooth speaker.

1045
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,220
Very good.

1046
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,680
There you go.

1047
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,120
Also, something we didn't mention in the review,

1048
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,560
but we got the keyboards that don't light up.

1049
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,440
Now, that said, this is one of my all-time favorite keyboards

1050
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,560
on a laptop ever now.

1051
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,040
But these keyboards are not backlit.

1052
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,660
After some conversations and reading some reviews online,

1053
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,640
it seems there's two types of keyboards with these ThinkPads.

1054
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,400
And the one that has the transparent keycaps

1055
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,840
so that the light shines through has a slightly softer feel.

1056
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,780
And I guess the keycaps wear off.

1057
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,840
And then there's one with an antimicrobial covering.

1058
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,480
That's the one we have, where the keycaps last longer

1059
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,440
and it's a little bit better of a tight feel,

1060
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,600
but they don't light up.

1061
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,280
So that's something I thought I'd mention.

1062
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,160
Also, I know you've already switched it,

1063
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,400
but the function key, control key, it's still,

1064
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,120
it's, I didn't switch it right away,

1065
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,440
and now my brain is broken.

1066
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,840
My hands are broken.

1067
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,520
Yeah, I had to make a call on that.

1068
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,200
So on the keyboard, in my opinion and Wes's opinion,

1069
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,440
the function button is where the control button should be.

1070
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,480
It's on the far left.

1071
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,660
The far, far left key, that should always be control,

1072
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,960
so that way you can just blindly mash it, right?

1073
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,160
Exactly.

1074
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,520
On the Lenovo ThinkPads, it's where the function button is.

1075
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,780
And then control is one button over.

1076
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,960
And then the worst part is that the sizes are the same.

1077
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,480
So you can switch them in the BIOS,

1078
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,600
but then your control button

1079
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,880
is like half the size it should be.

1080
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,400
Yeah, yeah, that is the downside.

1081
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,960
So I had to make that call.

1082
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,520
They do make it a BIOS level change.

1083
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,360
You go in there and you flip it.

1084
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,240
So obviously they know it's a problem.

1085
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,920
And I decided to do it sooner than later.

1086
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,240
I went about three days,

1087
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,760
and I think I went one day too long,

1088
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,120
because I started to remap it in my brain.

1089
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,320
But the sooner you switch it, it's just easier on you.

1090
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,160
It's just easier.

1091
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,520
And then it persists between reinstalls.

1092
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,240
It's just, it's the way to go.

1093
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,760
I did finally run into that problem

1094
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,760
that we did bring up in the initial review,

1095
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,680
that hey, some folks have had a problem

1096
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,980
where their CPUs are throttling.

1097
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,160
And it wasn't a big problem.

1098
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,000
In fact, I kind of liked it

1099
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,360
because I kept my laptop slightly cooler

1100
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,320
and I didn't really notice the performance difference.

1101
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,400
But I started having a problem when I closed the lid,

1102
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,880
the laptop wouldn't go to sleep.

1103
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,400
And it was reporting about thermal,

1104
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,760
a thermal trigger event.

1105
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,600
So, okay, well, let's look into this.

1106
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,640
So I started digging around

1107
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,000
and I found this great terminal app

1108
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,120
that I wanna tell you guys about this week.

1109
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,840
It's a terminal based CPU stress monitoring utility,

1110
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,520
and it's called STUI, S-TUI.

1111
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,160
And man, does it look slick.

1112
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,080
And it shows you everything,

1113
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,120
the frequency of your CPU, the utilization,

1114
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,540
the temperature and the power.

1115
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,960
And it puts it all on a really nice looking bar graph

1116
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,540
that persists on the screen for a while.

1117
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,060
So you can get a real sense of the range of punishment

1118
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,400
you're putting your machine through.

1119
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,820
And when I started watching this,

1120
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,560
I did start to see where the CPU was throttling me back,

1121
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,460
throttling me back.

1122
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,520
And I thought, well, this is bullshit.

1123
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,440
So I started digging into this

1124
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,880
and yeah, it's a firmware bug in the Lenovo's.

1125
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,540
But like all things Linux,

1126
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,580
there is a workaround for this issue

1127
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,000
that's been posted on GitHub.

1128
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,680
And this also works for the Dell XPS 9370s.

1129
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,000
So hot tip there, and a whole range of Lenovo's.

1130
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And it kind of tweaks what the range of power frequencies are

1131
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,440
that your CPU is allowed to reach.

1132
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,860
So it's not without some risk, I suppose.

1133
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:10,680
And it does require that you disable secure boot.

1134
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,520
You are mostly just banging some bits into,

1135
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,100
you know, firmware control parts of memory.

1136
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,900
So yeah, maybe some caution.

1137
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,000
Yes, and you have to disable the thermal D service.

1138
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,400
So I did that.

1139
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,120
So I disabled secure boot, I disabled thermal D,

1140
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,580
and you can turn this script off

1141
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,360
with a system D stop command.

1142
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,080
So it's not like it's, the reverse process is just-

1143
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,160
It's easy to undo.

1144
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,040
Yeah, yeah.

1145
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,600
And so then I started up the script

1146
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,400
and I immediately noticed that my laptop

1147
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,000
was reaching 4.2 gigahertz as it's specced.

1148
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,160
And I rebooted and immediately for the first time

1149
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,400
as the system was logging in,

1150
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,840
noticed the fans kicking up.

1151
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,680
They've never done that before.

1152
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,320
I haven't heard my fans today, no.

1153
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,760
No, no, you don't.

1154
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,140
So if you don't fix this bug,

1155
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,400
it keeps the CPU running it like,

1156
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,600
I don't think it goes beyond 3.5 gigahertz

1157
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,440
or something like that.

1158
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,760
Maybe, it depends on your rig,

1159
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,080
it can go up a little higher,

1160
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,060
but that actually makes it run cooler.

1161
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,240
And it makes the battery last a little bit longer.

1162
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,880
So I did also see a small hit to battery life.

1163
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,480
Also did not fix my suspend issues that I was having,

1164
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,800
that I originally tried to fix.

1165
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,840
No, really?

1166
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,240
So they're still there.

1167
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,480
Yeah, and it's weird, it's not every time.

1168
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,200
I close the lid and I'd say 80% of the time

1169
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,360
the machine goes to sleep, no problem.

1170
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,920
But I have run into the problem

1171
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,960
where I thought it's asleep and I put it in the bag.

1172
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,560
I take it out of the bag two hours later and it's-

1173
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,640
Burning up, wasted battery.

1174
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,320
Yeah, and-

1175
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,040
It's only on battery when this happens.

1176
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,040
I believe so.

1177
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,800
I believe it only happens when it's on battery.

1178
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,720
I have yet to have it trigger when it's plugged in.

1179
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,840
I can unplug it after I've put it to sleep and it's fine.

1180
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,120
See, now I'm just worried.

1181
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,120
This is lying and wait, I'm gonna run into it.

1182
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:48,960
I haven't yet.

1183
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,000
I was worried today on the train.

1184
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,440
In fact, it happened on the train.

1185
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,760
I was on battery the whole train ride down to see you today.

1186
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,640
And when we got to King Station,

1187
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,240
I closed the lid and it didn't go.

1188
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,440
I watched it and it didn't go to sleep.

1189
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,120
And I'm like, I wanna put it in my bag

1190
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,120
because we're at the train station.

1191
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,160
And I'm like, it's not going to sleep.

1192
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,720
Like I had to open it back up, put my password in,

1193
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,920
shut it down, confirm shutdown, wait for it to shut down.

1194
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,640
And I, you know, I had stuff open.

1195
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,400
I gotta say, Chris, your experience

1196
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,520
with just niggling little issues like that,

1197
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,480
it mirrors my own.

1198
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,960
And I don't know exactly what causes these things,

1199
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,400
but they're super frustrating, right?

1200
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,520
And they detract massively from the overall experience.

1201
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,640
Yeah, yeah, it's a little bit unfortunate.

1202
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,280
Welcome back to the show, Alex.

1203
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,320
Brandon, you fixed this on your X1 Carbon, do tell.

1204
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,280
Yeah, so have you guys updated your bios?

1205
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,080
Well, that's where we're going to next actually,

1206
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,920
but go ahead.

1207
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,840
Yeah, and that fixed the initial stuff.

1208
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,840
And then if I was using Wayland at all,

1209
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,560
it would not go into suspend at all.

1210
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,640
So right now I'm using X11.

1211
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,760
I believe I'm on X11, yeah, I'm on Neon.

1212
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,400
So I think that's, yeah, that's X11.

1213
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:02,000
So the thing is the plasma desktop doesn't yet,

1214
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
although it will soon have a way to update your firmware

1215
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,120
from the graphical desktop.

1216
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,880
You're saying it's worse than Gnome.

1217
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,720
I never thought I'd hear you say it, Chris.

1218
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,600
The advantage on Gnome is when you go into Gnome software,

1219
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,680
it's just along with all your software updates is boom,

1220
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,160
here's a firmware update.

1221
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,400
Or maybe you, for some reason, are an XFCE user,

1222
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,960
or like you say, a tiling window manager,

1223
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,880
you're not going to get this stuff

1224
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,200
unless you specifically want to install all the Gnome stuff

1225
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,200
to run Gnome software.

1226
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,840
And I don't.

1227
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,320
So in the case of the T480,

1228
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,240
the firmware update does not fix this issue,

1229
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,800
but it does for some systems.

1230
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,920
But there is a way to do LVFS the hard way.

1231
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,720
Now remember, the Linux Vendor Firmware Service

1232
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,880
is the project that's collecting all of these different

1233
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,080
firmwares from the vendors

1234
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,580
and then shipping them down to your machine.

1235
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:49,580
And part of that is the FW update daemon, or FWPT.

1236
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:50,800
FWPT.

1237
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,600
It's a simple daemon that allows session software,

1238
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,040
which could be Gnome software,

1239
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,120
could be Discover, or will be soon.

1240
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,760
It's coming soon in an update.

1241
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:05,160
It allows them to check for firmwares on your local system

1242
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,820
by enumerating the hardware,

1243
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:10,020
seeing what their firmware versions are,

1244
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,440
and then delivering that information back to the client.

1245
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,040
So in this case, we're going to be using the command line.

1246
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,160
It's designed for desktops,

1247
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,960
but it's also actually usable on phones

1248
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,320
and several headless servers where you can just SSH in

1249
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,120
and you can use these same exact commands

1250
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,920
to update the firmware on your servers if you want.

1251
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,560
So if you want to find out if you have a device

1252
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,600
with firmware that is supported by FW update,

1253
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,520
you have to get on the command line

1254
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,800
and run the command FW update manager get devices.

1255
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,360
And we'll have a link to all of this in the show notes.

1256
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,960
Once you get the devices,

1257
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,280
there's an FW update manager refresh command,

1258
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,440
which goes out and it's like a package repo refresh.

1259
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,480
It goes out and it gets all the latest firmwares

1260
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,420
that are applicable,

1261
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,840
versions that are applicable to your hardware.

1262
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,680
Nice.

1263
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,800
And then you can just simply update

1264
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,800
the command FW update manager, get dash updates.

1265
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,360
It goes out and downloads all them

1266
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,960
and then FW update manager update.

1267
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,800
Again, all this will be linked to the show notes.

1268
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,280
So you just made a guide for me

1269
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,400
because I haven't played with any of this yet,

1270
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,960
but it's coming up.

1271
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,360
Yeah, and it makes it really nice

1272
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,240
because you can just do all this from the command line.

1273
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,400
Doesn't matter what desktop environment you have.

1274
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,680
And it's kind of neat.

1275
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,400
Like the FW update manager, get dash devices

1276
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,680
shows you a bunch of cool information about the hardware.

1277
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,840
Here's my T480 Thunderbolt controller.

1278
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,680
Isn't that neat?

1279
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,640
And then you do the refresh command

1280
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,640
to go out and pull down the latest repos,

1281
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,320
get dash updates to download them,

1282
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,480
and then just update.

1283
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,600
It will download and apply all the updates for your system

1284
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,160
and updates that can be live will be done immediately.

1285
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,400
And then it will also set aside updates

1286
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,400
that need to run at boot up.

1287
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,520
And next time you reboot your distro,

1288
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,500
it'll stage them and apply them.

1289
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,960
That's just fantastic.

1290
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:48,800
Wow.

1291
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,620
Isn't that great?

1292
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,160
How did this happen?

1293
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,320
Like in the back room without any of us really noticing

1294
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,880
and now not only does it not brick our machines,

1295
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,480
but it just works.

1296
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,840
Yeah, and it's another cool way to get information

1297
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,700
about the devices in your system.

1298
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,800
So that's all outlined in the show notes.

1299
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,560
There's also a really simple EZR Twiki go figure,

1300
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,120
as well as the project's documentation.

1301
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:15,020
In fact, if you just run FW update MGR dash dash help,

1302
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,080
all the stuff is right there.

1303
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,000
It's really super simple to mess around with.

1304
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,840
So I ran that on my T480 and we were fully up to date.

1305
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,180
They shipped all up to date.

1306
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,760
And they're pretty new, so that makes sense.

1307
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,720
Right, yeah.

1308
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,720
Unfortunately, it's not a firmware update for us.

1309
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,760
But I have read that some X1 users have

1310
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,840
been able to resolve the issue with a firmware update.

1311
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,600
So I'm hopeful it might come around to us.

1312
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,400
And now we know how to do it.

1313
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,640
So we'll keep an eye out.

1314
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,640
A couple other things.

1315
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,480
Setting up this machine, I decided

1316
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,480
I got this thing with 32 gigs of RAM, an MV and eDrive.

1317
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,760
Let's do some virtualization.

1318
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,560
Right?

1319
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:45,920
Right?

1320
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,720
You got to put this thing through its paces.

1321
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:52,000
So I'm trying out two different virtualization managers.

1322
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,040
First and foremost, you've got to get Vert Manager.

1323
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,560
It's the go-to tool for the desktop.

1324
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,160
So I installed Vert Manager.

1325
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:03,280
And that's what I was using for my Haiku review and drive

1326
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,780
through, whatever you want to call it.

1327
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,320
It's not really a review.

1328
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,040
And it works pretty good.

1329
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,920
But it's not HTML5 enough, you know what I'm saying, Wes?

1330
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,600
No, it is not.

1331
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,400
I mean, it's nice.

1332
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,000
It's there.

1333
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,360
But, well, it's just not that slick.

1334
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,900
I actually kid.

1335
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:19,600
I'm just joking.

1336
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,840
But both Wes and I decided to take a little look at Kimchi

1337
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,280
over the last week, which is an HTML5-based management

1338
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,540
tool for KVM.

1339
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,640
And it's designed to make it as easy as possible

1340
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,760
to get started with KVM and create your first guess.

1341
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,240
And I like this a lot, because it

1342
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,920
makes it accessible to people that maybe have never really

1343
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,640
messed around with this before.

1344
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:46,960
We have KVM baked into our Linux desktops.

1345
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,320
I don't know how to state this to you.

1346
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,600
That is an enterprise-grade virtualizer

1347
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:56,600
that entire companies base their revenue source off of.

1348
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,840
In the early days, like back when

1349
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:03,880
I was trying out BOS R5, we had mainframes that did this.

1350
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,580
This is what mainframes did.

1351
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:08,080
And they cost so much money.

1352
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,440
And they had to have massive support contracts.

1353
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,240
And they had to have proprietary hardware.

1354
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,640
And it was a massive investment to have

1355
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,840
a bunch of virtual machines.

1356
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:22,600
And now, we have something 100 times better, more powerful,

1357
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,480
and faster just baked into our Linux desktops.

1358
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,800
Every Linux laptop, every Linux desktop out there

1359
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,080
has the potential to access this thing called KVM.

1360
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,280
You just have to install a few tools.

1361
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,960
And the power of that is just sort of underappreciated

1362
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,840
by those of us that have just grown used to it.

1363
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,400
But when people are coming over to Linux,

1364
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,240
it's one of those cornerstone features.

1365
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,700
It's something that maybe they want to try for their work,

1366
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,200
or maybe it's something they've read about and learned about.

1367
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,400
And Kimchi makes it all accessible.

1368
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,200
It is a very nice web GUI that sits on top of KVM that makes

1369
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,040
it simple to manage your VMs.

1370
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,040
Yeah, because unfortunately, a lot of the tooling

1371
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:04,180
that ends up sort of focused around the big server cases,

1372
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:08,280
because that's like probably 99% of what actually runs on KVM.

1373
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,560
But these days, it runs pretty darn well just doing desktops.

1374
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,240
Yep.

1375
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,480
I also, I really liked, I would never use it now,

1376
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,360
but back in the day, when I first was trying to set up Linux,

1377
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,120
having a tool like even like Webman,

1378
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,960
which was a little dangerous, but was very useful for just

1379
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,920
kind of closing a couple of gaps.

1380
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,760
I didn't really understand how to do something like under Samba

1381
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,980
and having Webman available to help sort of build out

1382
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:35,800
that config file.

1383
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,140
Then I could then go reverse engineer what it had done.

1384
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:38,360
Right.

1385
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,480
When you're learning, you just want like a nice GUI

1386
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,000
that you can explore and poke around and fiddle with options.

1387
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,960
For my own systems that I run on Digital Ocean,

1388
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,640
I use Cockpit to manage them.

1389
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,200
There you go.

1390
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:48,720
And I love it.

1391
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,640
I think it's great.

1392
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,780
So Kimchi is pretty nice.

1393
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:54,480
It's a little tricky to get working on Ubuntu 18.04.

1394
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,480
It requires a package called Python Imaging, which is not

1395
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,480
in at least the regular Ubuntu repo.

1396
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,440
It might be in Universe.

1397
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,120
And it won't install without that,

1398
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,800
even though it has been replaced by, what was it,

1399
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,400
Python Ping or something?

1400
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,600
PIL, the pillow, I think is what you would have been installing,

1401
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,200
an alternative imaging library.

1402
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,700
So Kimchi could use that, but they

1403
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,440
have hardcoded in the deb that it

1404
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,620
needs this specific package.

1405
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,080
It is available for 18.04, so I've

1406
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,780
linked it in the show notes if you want to try giving it a go.

1407
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,920
It's still early days for Kimchi,

1408
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,200
but I have a lot of hope that it's

1409
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,100
going to be a super nice way for people

1410
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,600
to manage a handful of VMs.

1411
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,940
You know, you imagine something like this on your LAN,

1412
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:36,320
you throw a machine in the closet or in the garage,

1413
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,500
and you could use this to replace something

1414
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,360
like Proxmox.

1415
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,320
Right, yeah, exactly.

1416
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,360
And it's just nice for those cases

1417
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,720
where maybe you don't use libvert on the command line

1418
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,600
all the darn time.

1419
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,480
You just forget what flags there are.

1420
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,320
Well, here you go.

1421
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,440
I'll tell you one other thing I've

1422
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,880
used this week for the first time was boxes.

1423
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,400
Oh, yeah.

1424
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,080
And I had to install Windows for some stupid reason.

1425
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,160
I can't remember who it was.

1426
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,600
I'm so sorry.

1427
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,320
Thanks.

1428
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,440
And I threw the ISO into boxes, and 20 minutes later,

1429
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,240
or 15 minutes later or something,

1430
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,480
I had a fully booted, activated Windows 10 system,

1431
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,400
completely touch-free installer.

1432
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,840
Amazing experience.

1433
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:17,120
Yeah, but if you're on the GNOME desktop, boxes is so great.

1434
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,660
I considered installing under Plasma,

1435
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,520
but I ended up going for Vert Manager.

1436
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,960
Brandon, I'm curious about your use of Cockpit

1437
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,000
from your workstation and laptop.

1438
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,380
Yeah, so I use it to manage virtual machines

1439
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,060
with the machines plug-in.

1440
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:35,360
So it basically does most of the things I need.

1441
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,920
If I need to create special networks,

1442
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,200
I have to go to the command line or open up Vert Manager

1443
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:47,440
to set up networks that are not just the default NAT network.

1444
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:52,960
But everything else is available right in Cockpit.

1445
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,280
It's super easy to use.

1446
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:58,960
You can get access to a console, add additional disks to a VM.

1447
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,160
Basically, all the things I would need to use locally.

1448
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,720
Yeah, and so you use that to manage your own local VMs,

1449
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,560
not even VMs up on a server.

1450
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:13,000
Just local VMs on my workstation for servers in my basement.

1451
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,760
I have a cluster of three servers that are running.

1452
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,320
But in that case, I'm running Obert.

1453
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,400
As one does in his basement, right?

1454
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,640
Yeah, that's what you do when you have a basement, right?

1455
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,840
And one gig up down the century link.

1456
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,680
Oh, yes.

1457
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,600
That is what you do.

1458
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,440
Yeah, those are the two requirements, a good basement

1459
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,280
or, in my case, a garage and a great link.

1460
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,880
My basement is full of scary spiders that jump.

1461
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,880
I do not like it.

1462
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,920
Yeah, they got a lot of those down there, Alex.

1463
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,720
They got them up here in Washington, too.

1464
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,800
You can't get away from the spiders in the States,

1465
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,640
unfortunately.

1466
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,920
Just don't let the ones with red bellies get near you.

1467
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,640
That's the one you need to worry about.

1468
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,160
Oh, gosh.

1469
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,120
The spiders around here have a legal right to marry.

1470
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,920
Let's not freak out people with arachnophobia,

1471
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,160
because I'm one of them.

1472
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,080
And it's making me a little uncomfortable.

1473
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,440
There's a bunch of different ways

1474
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,320
to manage your virtual machines.

1475
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,520
But Vert Manager and Kim Chi were the one

1476
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,520
that I thought would be worth talking about,

1477
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,720
but definitely a good, big, hearty plug for Cockpit,

1478
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,480
because that's what I personally use to manage mine.

1479
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,200
I mean, you could be hardcore like Wes Payne

1480
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,160
and just do it all with QMU on the command line,

1481
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,320
and then VMC in, and just what's the problem?

1482
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,000
What's the problem?

1483
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
That's what Wes says.

1484
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,880
So next week, we should have a review

1485
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,680
of that Dell Precision laptop.

1486
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,080
I wanted to give it enough time.

1487
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,640
I just felt like I hadn't had enough time with it.

1488
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,960
I did run some pretty hardcore benchmarks.

1489
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,360
One of the things I'd love to get the audience's feedback

1490
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:37,000
on is I'm thinking about trying to come up

1491
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,960
with a framework to review laptops

1492
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,040
when they're under extreme load.

1493
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,040
So how does it handle thermals?

1494
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,360
Does it start cutting back on the CPU

1495
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,840
to bring the temperature down?

1496
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,840
How long can it run it back before it has to start caving?

1497
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,360
I've been testing that on the ThinkPad

1498
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,120
and on the Dell Precision, and I find

1499
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,000
that to be interesting workload, because every now and then,

1500
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,440
you just need your machine to be a champion for two hours.

1501
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,000
And so how does it run at full bore, sustainable workloads?

1502
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,200
Does it start cutting back?

1503
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,040
I'm curious what folks think about that idea

1504
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,680
and other things of that nature we could start testing

1505
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,960
on these laptops, because the goal of these reviews

1506
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,480
is to give you usable information

1507
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,960
to make a purchase or to defer a purchase

1508
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,000
or to just reflect on your own setup.

1509
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,200
I'm not here to sell a laptop.

1510
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,720
I'm here to try to tell you if this is a reasonable tool

1511
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,320
or not.

1512
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,440
And so I'm always struggling to come up

1513
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,080
with ways to properly do that.

1514
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,440
Benchmarks are one way, but what's

1515
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,080
the real point of those, unless you could actually

1516
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,640
compare it to a real-world globe?

1517
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,480
We want to get closer to simulating something

1518
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,800
that you might actually do.

1519
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,520
So I'd love ideas on that and tests.

1520
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,920
I'd love some objective way of measuring fan noise,

1521
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,000
because that really annoys.

1522
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,360
So when you hear a MacBook about to take off,

1523
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,440
that might be different to what an XPS sounds like

1524
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,200
or something.

1525
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:54,680
Yeah.

1526
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,680
I mean, I have tools to measure the decibel output

1527
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,320
of the laptop, and I could just get it under load,

1528
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,280
and I could start measuring that.

1529
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,240
That's definitely something I could check.

1530
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,000
That's a good one.

1531
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,200
And if you guys out there listening have suggestions,

1532
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,720
just go to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1533
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,960
You can send them in that way or tweet me, at Chris LAS.

1534
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,160
I'd just be curious to know.

1535
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,280
I showed some recent benchmarks that I was doing

1536
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,440
and kind of put a little context as to what

1537
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,440
I was trying to achieve.

1538
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,440
And I got some great suggestions on Twitter, too.

1539
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,080
So I've been collecting information,

1540
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,640
and I've always really kind of wanted

1541
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,720
to nail this down to try to make it something

1542
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,320
that, even if you're not in the market yet, it's still useful.

1543
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,360
So I want to try to achieve that.

1544
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,240
So give me your tips and what you'd like to see,

1545
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,800
and hopefully we'll have a decent review for you next week.

1546
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,000
I can't promise that I'll have it nailed by next week.

1547
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,680
But over the next few reviews, as we start thinking this way,

1548
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,600
I think we'll get it.

1549
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,080
Yeah, get a little more systematic.

1550
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,960
Yeah, come up with a way to do that.

1551
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,080
We have so much stuff going on behind the scenes these days.

1552
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,180
So we'll be talking about some of that as well,

1553
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,340
some of the changes that we're making to our pipeline

1554
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:53,880
and how we're going to open source all of that.

1555
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,220
So that's coming in the future in a future episode

1556
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,360
as well as time permits.

1557
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,760
So we have a lot to get into, but I

1558
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,680
think that's probably where we'll leave it for this week.

1559
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,180
We'll try to keep it a little shorter.

1560
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,060
I'm flirting with the time formats,

1561
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:07,040
trying to see what people like.

1562
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,360
Tuesdays can be pretty busy.

1563
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,080
That is true.

1564
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,360
So you've got to let us know.

1565
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,680
Middle of the week.

1566
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,880
People got a lot of shows by the time this comes out.

1567
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,380
We want you to want to fit in Linux Unblogged.

1568
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,880
You've got to get in that sweet spot.

1569
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,500
And don't forget, next week is 270.

1570
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,520
We'd love to have you show up in our virtual lug and hang out.

1571
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,320
Just Google for the Jupiter Colony Mumble Guide.

1572
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,000
Mumble is free open source software.

1573
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:27,920
You can get installed.

1574
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,480
We'd like it if you have a headset.

1575
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,200
And with that, a mic and headphones.

1576
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,120
You know, not just something that's on your head.

1577
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:34,680
Not like a tiara.

1578
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,400
That doesn't count.

1579
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,600
I mean, you can have that too.

1580
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,200
Don't want to stop you.

1581
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,160
I don't know.

1582
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,360
Unless it has a mic built in.

1583
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,800
The nice thing about the virtual lug

1584
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,320
is you can dress however you want.

1585
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,720
They come as you are.

1586
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,760
I imagine most of them are sitting there,

1587
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:50,200
drinking something, scratching, browsing the web, and chatting.

1588
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,880
Like, you know, they are probably pretty chill.

1589
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,480
That's what makes it a virtual party.

1590
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:54,980
I know.

1591
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,000
I should go do that.

1592
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,360
I should go home while you do the show.

1593
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,000
I'll jump in the lug and just see what it's like.

1594
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,560
I should try that one time.

1595
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,800
But not next week.

1596
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,360
Not the week after, but maybe someday.

1597
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,680
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode.

1598
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:10,240
Go get more of Westpane at techsnap.systems or at Westpane.

1599
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,160
I'm at chrislas.

1600
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,200
The whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

1601
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,480
Thanks so much for joining us.

1602
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,560
And we will see you next Tuesday.

1603
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:59,960
I had a lot of fun with Haiku.

1604
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:00,960
Way more than I expected.

1605
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,960
I know.

1606
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:02,960
It was just so good.

1607
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,960
It's good stuff.

1608
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,960
It's good stuff.

1609
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,100
Mumble Room, thank you guys very much for making it.

1610
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,660
There was one story that didn't make it into the main show that I wanted to share with

1611
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:11,660
you guys.

1612
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:16,860
It just doesn't really have like a direct Linux angle, but it sure makes me smile.

1613
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:25,760
There is, for some unknown reason, now a Star Trek Enterprise-shaped gaming PC being built

1614
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,660
by Lenovo.

1615
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:28,660
How did this happen?

1616
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:29,660
Okay, no, no.

1617
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:30,660
I don't even need to know.

1618
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:31,920
I'm just too excited.

1619
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:37,400
Wes, Lenovo is boldly taking computers where they have never gone before.

1620
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,440
Oh, it's getting cringey already.

1621
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:46,580
With a newly revealed Lenovo Titanium PC shaped like Star Trek's USS Enterprise.

1622
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:55,760
The Lenovo Titanium Enterprise NCC-1701A is shaped like the Starship Enterprise, like

1623
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,000
Captain Kirk's Enterprise, before he just... Oh, I won't spoil it.

1624
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,800
I won't spoil that part, but let's just say Klingons were involved.

1625
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,360
It's a real beaut.

1626
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,360
Fascinating.

1627
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,640
Definitely not a trash heap.

1628
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:14,180
The technology includes a GeForce RTX 2080, an overclocked 9th generation Intel, 32 gigs

1629
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:21,920
of RAM, and a one terabyte M.2 SSD, and a two terabyte... or a spinning Rust disk.

1630
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:26,360
They say that it's the perfect PC for Star Trek enthusiast gamers.

1631
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,040
I'm thinking maybe we got the wrong Lenovo's, Chris.

1632
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,740
I know, right?

1633
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:36,440
It's super lit, too, and I mean lit up, like it's got lights everywhere in the thing.

1634
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:41,360
All over the saucer section, the warp nacelles light up, the deflector dish lights up, and

1635
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,000
it's on a stand.

1636
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:49,440
Like the Starship models themselves, it's on an arm stand, and it's kind of shaped like

1637
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,300
the Enterprise, and the PC parts are all stuffed into it.

1638
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:55,360
The cooling is on the bottom of the saucer section.

1639
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,440
The nacelles are wider and larger than the actual Starship.

1640
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:03,340
That's where the bulk of the PC is, is in the primary hall, if you're a Star Trek nerd.

1641
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:08,920
It still looks legit enough that if I was a big Star Trek online player, if I still

1642
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:09,920
did the Star Trek podcast-

1643
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:10,920
You would have to have it.

1644
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:11,920
You would have to have it.

1645
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,280
I mean, if you put KDE neon on that thing, that'd be pretty good.

1646
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,400
So any deets on when can we get it?

1647
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,400
Where can we get it?

1648
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,440
Actually, I want you to guess what the price is.

1649
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,000
Guess what the starting price is before you've even spec'd it.

1650
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,080
Now it's not insane, but it's not cheap.

1651
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,640
I'm going to go with $4,000.

1652
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,160
That is probably what it would be after I spec'd it.

1653
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,080
The starting price, the base price-

1654
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,080
$3,999.

1655
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:38,120
All right, anybody else have a guess?

1656
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:41,120
This is Price is Right Rules, so if you go over, you're disqualified.

1657
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,920
Anybody else have a guess of what the-

1658
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:43,920
Three grand.

1659
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,920
Three grand, okay.

1660
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:45,920
We have three grand.

1661
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:46,920
What did you say?

1662
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,920
Four grand?

1663
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:48,920
Yeah.

1664
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,920
I'm going to say three, two, one, zero.

1665
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,920
Three, two, one, zero.

1666
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:51,920
All right.

1667
01:03:51,920 --> 01:04:01,200
The Lenovo Titanium Enterprise NCC-1701 has a starting price of $2,180.

1668
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:18,840
You overbid, so you all should go buy one now.
