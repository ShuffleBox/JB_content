00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 40 for May 13th, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that just hit its distinguished

00:41.720 --> 00:46.240
forties. My name is Chris. My name is Matt. Hey there, Matt. Forty weeks, buddy, right

00:46.240 --> 00:52.560
in a row, too. Man. I mean, it's no Coderadio 100 or TechSnap 160, whatever, but I'm a little

00:52.560 --> 00:55.520
proud of it, because this is just a little idea we have. We're like, hey, we've got too

00:55.520 --> 00:59.440
much show every week. Let's do another show. Right. Here we are 40 weeks later. I think

00:59.440 --> 01:04.400
it's turned out pretty good. Not to pat ourselves on our own back or anything like that. No.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.600
It's going to be a fun show today, too. We're introducing a new segment in this week, so

01:07.600 --> 01:10.200
I'll tell you about that in just a second. Of course, we've got our feedback like we

01:10.200 --> 01:16.280
always do, and two developers from the LXQT project have joined us to discuss our first

01:16.280 --> 01:21.240
look that we had over the weekend at LXQT, just at their first major beta. We're going

01:21.240 --> 01:25.080
to chat with them in a little bit. Then we'll get to that new segment. So that new segment

01:25.080 --> 01:30.880
I mentioned, we're going to call it the Mumble Roundtable. Right now, I've submitted a link

01:30.880 --> 01:36.740
to our chat room, and they are voting on what should be the roundtable's topic. I've proposed

01:36.740 --> 01:41.840
two topics. I don't pick the topic. The live stream picks the topic. Right now, the two

01:41.840 --> 01:46.720
topics we have proposed to them is the orange box that Canonical announced today. It is

01:46.720 --> 01:53.440
an Ubuntu cluster in a box. It's a pretty cool concept, and it's made up of like 10

01:53.440 --> 02:00.200
NUCs in a box, 10 Intel NUCs in a box, and it's a pretty neat deal. Also, the second

02:00.200 --> 02:04.800
topic that is being voted on, so there's two choices. Choice number two, antivirus pioneer

02:04.800 --> 02:10.280
Alan Solomon thinks that antivirus is dead, and he says he switched to Linux instead.

02:10.280 --> 02:15.340
So whichever one is the winning topic towards the end of the show will be our open roundtable

02:15.340 --> 02:20.120
discussion that we'll get to. So I'm looking forward to that to kind of give our virtual

02:20.120 --> 02:27.440
lug a chance to stretch out a little bit and pontificate on a good topic. But, Matt, before

02:27.440 --> 02:30.960
we get to that, we should probably start with the feedback, because there was something

02:30.960 --> 02:31.960
that, man.

02:31.960 --> 02:32.960
Oh, boy.

02:32.960 --> 02:36.480
Chief of the Broadcasting was off the air basically yesterday for Chrome users.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.440
Yeah, what was up with that?

02:38.440 --> 02:43.120
Case of the Mondays. So Mark writes in, and he says, hey, I can get an old malware warning.

02:43.120 --> 02:48.040
I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 with XFCE and Chromium. I like that he's giving us the XFCE, like,

02:48.040 --> 02:52.200
just so you know. I'm getting a malware error in Chromium, but I'm running on it. OK. Tried

02:52.200 --> 02:57.080
to download the HD video version of Last 3.11, and I got a malware warning from Chromium.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.560
Probably a bug, but I thought I should let you know about it. Love the show. Now, we

02:59.560 --> 03:03.760
got a lot of emails like this, but Mark had a good, concise email. And Mark also was kind

03:03.760 --> 03:08.280
enough to include a screenshot. So if you didn't get to enjoy this error that was happening

03:08.280 --> 03:13.400
to us yesterday, there it is. It says, the website ahead contains malware.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.400
Oh, boy.

03:14.400 --> 03:18.520
It says, Chromium has blocked access. Now, if you read carefully, it actually says, Chromium

03:18.520 --> 03:24.640
has blocked access to www.podtrack.com. It actually wasn't a problem with the Jupyter

03:24.640 --> 03:29.200
Broadcasting website. It was a problem with the download stat tracking service we use.

03:29.200 --> 03:36.280
PodTrack's kind of like the gold standard in legitimate podcast statistic download counts.

03:36.280 --> 03:40.400
As good of a service there is, it's pretty much PodTrack. Now, the problem was their

03:40.400 --> 03:47.280
whole domain got blacklisted by the Google anti-malware whatever it is, and so every

03:47.280 --> 03:52.560
podcaster that uses PodTrack had their downloads unavailable to Chromium users and then Chrome

03:52.560 --> 03:57.440
users and then eventually Firefox and eventually Safari and other browsers later in the day

03:57.440 --> 04:00.860
all got their downloads blocked. I mean, this is not only taking out Jupyter Broadcasting,

04:00.860 --> 04:06.720
but it took out Twit, it took out NPR, the Nerdist, the Discovery Networks. All of those

04:06.720 --> 04:12.200
guys that use PodTrack were nailed by this. Now, our awesome web developer, Aaron, was

04:12.200 --> 04:17.040
able to, about midway in the day, I said, all right, I call uncle. Aaron, can you please

04:17.040 --> 04:21.240
go in there and just pull all the PodTrack links from our site? Because this also affected

04:21.240 --> 04:26.600
the HTML5 video player. So even just trying to stream video from our website, the only

04:26.600 --> 04:32.480
thing that worked was the live stream. And Lynn this morning, earlier this morning, PodTrack

04:32.480 --> 04:36.200
sends an email. He says, hi, Chris. Dear Chris, yesterday we discovered an issue with the

04:36.200 --> 04:41.680
PodTrack domain that impacts some non-iTunes podcast users. Yeah, like everyone using Chrome.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.480
It's like, come on, really guys?

04:43.480 --> 04:48.240
Yeah. You know, for those idiots that don't use iTunes, the Chrome browser blocked PodTrack.com

04:48.240 --> 04:52.320
domain reporting it as malware, followed later by Firefox and Safari as they use the same

04:52.320 --> 04:56.400
malware list as Google. At the same time, Chrome's diagnostic page said there's no reports

04:56.400 --> 05:00.120
of malware for this domain in the last 90 days. And for more than eight years, we have

05:00.120 --> 05:03.840
not seen a browser return the domain as malware. They scanned the servers ourselves and we

05:03.840 --> 05:07.720
didn't find any malware. We requested a review from Google and sometime between 1 a.m. and

05:07.720 --> 05:12.400
7 a.m. Eastern today, so that's this morning, Chrome and other browsers corrected their

05:12.400 --> 05:17.960
listing of PodTrack.com domain and the services are working in all browsers again. So we essentially

05:17.960 --> 05:20.600
just didn't have, so for the first half of the day we didn't have downloads, for the

05:20.600 --> 05:27.160
second half of the day and into today we didn't have any tracking. So not a great day for

05:27.160 --> 05:31.120
us and not a great day for podcast listeners either. And in a way too, doesn't it show

05:31.120 --> 05:37.560
you how dangerous it can be to consolidate power like that on the web? Because even though

05:37.560 --> 05:43.260
that anti-malware tool does a lot of good and it saves a lot of Windows users' butts,

05:43.260 --> 05:49.120
it also can go very badly. And in this case, it essentially took an entire industry, the

05:49.120 --> 05:54.120
Google malware system took an entire industry off the air. Now did PodTrack have a legitimate

05:54.120 --> 05:57.540
malware? They claim not, but maybe they did. I mean they do use IIS after all, so it seems

05:57.540 --> 06:03.200
entirely conceivable they did have something. But the end result for me was like, oh well

06:03.200 --> 06:07.920
sorry, all of our listeners and downloaders are getting this big old scary error that

06:07.920 --> 06:12.000
makes it look like the Jupiter Broadcasting website has malware on it. So it's not a good

06:12.000 --> 06:17.120
experience all around. And I hope that Google, this isn't the first time we've seen something

06:17.120 --> 06:21.400
like this happen, I think this is maybe the largest scale outage that the Google anti-malware

06:21.400 --> 06:28.400
service has caused, and it's not a great experience. So I apologize to you guys out there who are

06:28.400 --> 06:32.960
trying to download the Linux Action Show or the FoShow on Monday or Coda Radio and got

06:32.960 --> 06:36.720
that error. Monday's a big day for us, so I know it affected a lot of folks out there,

06:36.720 --> 06:42.360
I apologize about that. But it should all be resolved now. And the RSS feeds, for the

06:42.360 --> 06:47.440
most part, weren't impacted as far as I know. So if you ever want to just bypass it, just

06:47.440 --> 06:52.960
subscribe in your favorite RSS client, maybe it's G Potter or Miro or whatever it is, and

06:52.960 --> 06:55.120
that might have solved the problem.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.960
All right Matt, next email comes in from Gargan, I think, Jarjan?

06:57.960 --> 06:58.960
Gargan, okay.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.400
Well I'm not, I apologize, I'm not getting that one right. He has a little follow-up

07:02.400 --> 07:06.240
on our fragmentation time bomb discussion. He says he feels that fragmentation isn't

07:06.240 --> 07:11.280
really an issue. Consider Qt and GTK, so what? You have them both on Windows and even OS

07:11.280 --> 07:18.080
again. Does using Qt on iOS fragment iOS? Not one bit. It's still iOS, a well-defined

07:18.080 --> 07:23.160
target for developers with a semi-stable API. Look at the toolkits that Windows has. Microsoft

07:23.160 --> 07:28.640
foundation classes, the Windows template library, Smart Win++, the Object Windows library,

07:28.640 --> 07:34.560
Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Qt, GTK+, Swing, and WX Widgets, all on Windows.

07:34.560 --> 07:39.800
The problem is a fragmented core. Examples would be the multitude of glibc, unstable

07:39.800 --> 07:46.240
kernel driver API, systemd, sysv, upstart, glib, mesa, kairo, gstreamer, pulseaudio,

07:46.240 --> 07:51.160
and versions that compromise, or all versions that compromise the bedrock of the OS. So

07:51.160 --> 07:55.800
I was arguing yesterday that, yeah, the core is stable. He's saying, no it's not. It doesn't

07:55.800 --> 07:59.800
matter what's happening up in user land. Let them use whatever toolkits they want. What

07:59.800 --> 08:04.240
really matters is we have stable APIs and ABIs to target. And that's something we've

08:04.240 --> 08:09.800
heard from driver developers for years too. Do you think, Matt, maybe I was a little off

08:09.800 --> 08:14.840
the mark? Maybe I was misrepresenting how fragmented the Linux core is?

08:14.840 --> 08:19.560
I don't think so. I definitely see what they're saying. And I definitely agree with it to

08:19.560 --> 08:25.160
an extent. But I also think that because we're so freewheeling that we don't really have

08:25.160 --> 08:30.160
a dominant anything in the ecosystem. And I think that's probably kind of where a lot

08:30.160 --> 08:33.400
of people find frustration, including yourself. I think that's kind of the frustration we

08:33.400 --> 08:39.080
have. So I half agree with him. But at the same time, I also think that we do need to

08:39.080 --> 08:43.400
kind of, in user land, kind of figure out what we're doing, at least with the dominant

08:43.400 --> 08:46.840
distributions. And then everybody else can just do whatever they want.

08:46.840 --> 08:51.360
That being said, our biggest problem is we have half the camp that adamantly loves the

08:51.360 --> 08:54.240
fact that we have no dominant anything. And then we have the other half the camp that

08:54.240 --> 08:57.960
hates it. And as long as we have that, I don't ever see this getting resolved. I think it's

08:57.960 --> 09:00.000
always going to be a good effort.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.040
Always wasted effort, Matt, until it gets resolved. Yeah. And you know, it's kind of

09:04.040 --> 09:10.200
like evolution in a sense. Like eventually dominant strains and implementations stand

09:10.200 --> 09:16.600
out in a way. And eventually, it's a lot messier. It takes a lot longer. I think it eventually

09:16.600 --> 09:21.640
gets worked out. And I think things like system D, and I think the kernel API thing is a valid

09:21.640 --> 09:25.080
complaint. But I don't think it's as valid as it used to be. So I think it's over time,

09:25.080 --> 09:27.600
it is actually just kind of improving upon itself.

09:27.600 --> 09:32.080
Nico writes in. He says, thanks for the great show. I really like it, but. And there's always

09:32.080 --> 09:33.680
a but, Matt.

09:33.680 --> 09:34.680
Always the but.

09:34.680 --> 09:40.120
I was extremely disappointed with your discussion on Menjia in episode 39. I almost never write

09:40.120 --> 09:44.220
any kind of comments to anybody, but this just got me so sad that I just have to write

09:44.220 --> 09:47.120
this one. Now, he specifically laid out what he didn't like. I wouldn't went ahead and

09:47.120 --> 09:51.280
cut it because these emails that we're getting these days are just way too long. So I'm editing

09:51.280 --> 09:54.440
a little bit. So I just I wanted to kind of just touch on some of his core points. He

09:54.440 --> 09:59.640
says, first of all, what I was the most disappointed with was that you guys obviously did no research

09:59.640 --> 10:03.000
on the subject yourself. You just let the Mamba room tell you what they think about

10:03.000 --> 10:07.820
Menjia and maybe it's OK, but by doing so, you sure made it sound a whole lot more difficult

10:07.820 --> 10:12.280
and strange than it really is. And I must say, I don't I do not even understand half

10:12.280 --> 10:16.400
of what the complaints were. So long story short, do your own research. I think he's

10:16.400 --> 10:19.960
going to give any specifics. I mean, it's basically he just did exactly what he said

10:19.960 --> 10:23.640
the Mamba. Well, I kind of cut some of it to make it. I mean, the one thing like he

10:23.640 --> 10:28.280
took the most issue with was our discussion around packages and and like some of the how

10:28.280 --> 10:32.120
some of the weird packages in the repos and stuff like that night. I just saw him based

10:32.120 --> 10:36.040
into discussion. I mean, it's he loses right there. I mean, it's far as I'm that's not

10:36.040 --> 10:40.040
even a debate now. I mean, that's not to say it's not a nice distribution from other aspects

10:40.040 --> 10:44.640
of it, but that's that's through years and years of banging my face into RPM distros.

10:44.640 --> 10:49.480
That's that's well researched. Yeah, I mean, I do see your point there. I mean, I don't

10:49.480 --> 10:52.900
know, man. I mean, maybe we should put it on the schedule down the road in a few weeks.

10:52.900 --> 10:57.680
Maybe we should throw Miji on our machines and just kind of, you know, see what we maybe

10:57.680 --> 11:00.920
maybe, you know, like because I was pretty sure when we took the arts challenge, I was

11:00.920 --> 11:05.680
going to be like Mr. Nose up near. This is stupid. Yeah, I know. And I'm speaking exclusively

11:05.680 --> 11:10.240
of packaging worth with arch. I had no experience with the packaging. Yeah, that's true. I mean,

11:10.240 --> 11:15.200
we do know magic dust to make RPM suck less. And they maybe they do. I don't know. There

11:15.200 --> 11:19.160
is you are PMI in there. Yeah. Well, you know, I mean, I think it's worth a try. Sure. Yeah,

11:19.160 --> 11:22.320
I see what you're saying, though. Like arch is a fully different piece. But you're you've

11:22.320 --> 11:26.160
been down the RPM alley before, you know, what's at the end of that looking distro.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.600
I mean, I'm not not negating that at all. I think they did a lot of things right. But

11:29.600 --> 11:35.280
at the end of the day, for me, it's more than appearance packages, packages, packages. I

11:35.280 --> 11:39.240
I could have the ugliest desktop in the world. But if I got the packages I need, I'm happy.

11:39.240 --> 11:43.080
You know, that's just me. Yeah, I you know what? You make a lot of sense. And so let's

11:43.080 --> 11:47.460
give it some thought. Maybe you and I can do a little collab after Sunday on Sunday's

11:47.460 --> 11:51.220
last and figure out if there's a spot where we can slip in a Miji review and you know,

11:51.220 --> 11:55.640
but I kind of I kind of see your point, too. Like we have I got a certain time you've been

11:55.640 --> 12:00.720
around the block enough that you kind of learn like, you know, sometimes there's just no

12:00.720 --> 12:04.400
change in a distro. I don't know. We'll see. I don't mean I don't want to make it so heavy.

12:04.400 --> 12:08.520
So you and I will talk on Sunday. Maybe we'll decide to schedule it in the last and we'll

12:08.520 --> 12:11.880
do it. I have a feeling we're going to do it, but we'll talk about it. All right. With

12:11.880 --> 12:17.140
our rights in, he says, Hey, there, Chris and Matt. Love the show. I'm writing in for

12:17.140 --> 12:21.200
an idea of how to Linux for how to Linux. Now, we get a lot of these, but I just thought

12:21.200 --> 12:23.920
I'd take this opportunity to kind of update everybody on where we're at with how to Linux

12:23.920 --> 12:29.480
is I'm writing in on an idea for the show. My idea is using a digital ocean droplet and

12:29.480 --> 12:35.940
install a light desktop on it using X to go and X RDP server on a thin client to connect

12:35.940 --> 12:40.240
to the droplet over the Internet. You could have local sound, print and drive forwarding.

12:40.240 --> 12:44.240
I realize it's not a simple how to, but I'd love to see your approach to the task. Cheers

12:44.240 --> 12:50.440
for an interesting idea. Turning a digital ocean droplet into essentially a remote cloud

12:50.440 --> 12:54.320
desktop server. So I'm going to give you guys an update on where we're at with how to Linux.

12:54.320 --> 13:00.520
But first, why don't I give a thanks to our first sponsor? And that is Digital Ocean.

13:00.520 --> 13:04.800
Digital Ocean is simple cloud hosting. And I got to tell you guys, we got a great brand

13:04.800 --> 13:09.620
new promo code for the month of May. Guess what it is? Unplugged May. Unplugged May will

13:09.620 --> 13:13.680
get you a ten dollar credit so you can try out digital ocean for two months for free.

13:13.680 --> 13:17.040
If you get the five dollar, you don't know what digital ocean is. Digital Ocean is a

13:17.040 --> 13:20.760
simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to

13:20.760 --> 13:25.720
spin up a cloud server. Now, you're like, oh, sure. Sure, Chris. Sure. I got a tweet

13:25.720 --> 13:32.020
this week. I think our new record is thirty seven seconds. Thirty seven seconds. Now,

13:32.020 --> 13:36.020
most digital ocean users can spin up a cloud server in about fifty five seconds or so.

13:36.020 --> 13:40.360
Not our audience. Our audience is now thirty seven seconds. But here's the best part. Pricing

13:40.360 --> 13:44.720
plan started only five dollars a month for five hundred twelve megabytes of RAM, a twenty

13:44.720 --> 13:51.400
gigabyte SSD, one CPU and a terabyte of transfer for five dollars. That's a you know exactly

13:51.400 --> 13:55.160
how much you're going to pay. It's a fixed cost. It's not going to scale up for CPU usage.

13:55.160 --> 13:58.160
You know, you're not going to get you're not going to get charged one price for two hundred

13:58.160 --> 14:01.520
gigabytes of transfer and a different price for nine hundred gigabytes of transfer. You

14:01.520 --> 14:05.480
get a terabyte. It's included with that. And Digital Ocean has data center locations in

14:05.480 --> 14:11.360
New York, San Francisco, Singapore and Amsterdam. Their interface is simple. Their control panel

14:11.360 --> 14:16.880
is super intuitive and power users can replicate this control panel on a larger scale with

14:16.880 --> 14:22.160
their straightforward API. I have heard so many awesome stories of what our audience

14:22.160 --> 14:28.200
is using Digital Ocean for. So go over there, use the promo code for the month of May. Unplugged

14:28.200 --> 14:31.960
May. One word, unplugged May will get you that ten dollar credit. You can try out a

14:31.960 --> 14:35.920
Digital Ocean droplet for two months, even if you only use it for two months or just

14:35.920 --> 14:41.480
increase your own skill set. Work on something that you've been wanting to do. Scratch that

14:41.480 --> 14:45.840
itch. Try out that thing. They've got a great image backup system. So if you screw something

14:45.840 --> 14:50.600
up, just take a snapshot first. Revert right back. You get tier one bandwidth. It's all

14:50.600 --> 14:55.220
sitting on top of SSD drives with, I got to tell you, some of the best data center locations

14:55.220 --> 15:00.420
in the world. DigitalOcean.com. Use the promo code unplugged May to get that ten dollar

15:00.420 --> 15:05.400
credit. Go check them out and see what you can do. A really big thank you to DigitalOcean

15:05.400 --> 15:11.600
for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. Every month I find something new to do with my droplet

15:11.600 --> 15:14.840
and in this Sunday's last, I think we're going to be scratching an itch for you guys or at

15:14.840 --> 15:17.680
least we're going to make something itch and you're going to want to scratch it. So keep

15:17.680 --> 15:21.800
Digital Ocean in mind when we start talking about some server stuff on Sunday. DigitalOcean.com

15:21.800 --> 15:25.720
and use the promo code unplugged May and a really big thank you to those guys. Really

15:25.720 --> 15:29.840
appreciate them sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show and there's so many cool things you can

15:29.840 --> 15:34.560
do with it and you know what? It's all built on top of Linux so that's pretty cool too,

15:34.560 --> 15:39.520
right? So now you're supporting a company that also runs on top of Linux using KVM and

15:39.520 --> 15:43.240
all kinds of stuff. They really get their users. I think that's the big takeaway. It's

15:43.240 --> 15:49.320
just awesome. Now we have joining us two developers from the LXQT project. Now I know them by

15:49.320 --> 15:54.320
their mumble names but maybe we'll get to know their actual names. Starting first is

15:54.320 --> 15:59.200
Jay Lanch. Am I saying that right? That's Jerome Leclanche. Jay Leclanche. Jerome, welcome

15:59.200 --> 16:03.240
to Linux Unplugged and we also have PC Man joining us. And PC Man, what's your first

16:03.240 --> 16:13.360
name? PC Man? My name is in Chinese. My name is Hongren Yu. So I use this ID for short.

16:13.360 --> 16:20.460
And you're talking to us from Taiwan, right? Yes, I'm from Taiwan. And Jerome is in Cambridge

16:20.460 --> 16:24.920
I believe. So we got a 10 o'clock and a 5 a.m. are here with us. So I really appreciate

16:24.920 --> 16:28.840
you guys joining us. We're going to keep it brief since it is so after hours and the connection

16:28.840 --> 16:35.800
is a little shaky but the one thing that really struck me is LXQT as we looked at it on Sunday

16:35.800 --> 16:40.780
on the Linux action show, kind of looks like it's almost for a lot of users, Matt said

16:40.780 --> 16:45.560
he might be one of them, ready to use today. How far along do you guys see yourself? I

16:45.560 --> 16:50.760
don't know who's maybe the best person to ask. PC Man, what is your role at the LXQT

16:50.760 --> 16:58.280
project? Melanie, I'm responsible for the file manager.

16:58.280 --> 17:05.960
Oh okay. And some other parts, yeah. And Jay Lanch, what is your role at the LXQT project?

17:05.960 --> 17:13.360
I do mostly system administration and UX but PC Man is underselling himself. He's really

17:13.360 --> 17:20.440
the guy who built the original LXD Qt project before we merged with Razer Qt. Well, big

17:20.440 --> 17:27.040
respect because I think the work is remarkable already. So PC Man, I'll start with you then.

17:27.040 --> 17:33.320
How far along do you consider it right now? Is this sort of halfway baked? Is this five

17:33.320 --> 17:38.600
percent baked? Is it almost done? Where do you see it at right now in your opinion?

17:38.600 --> 17:46.340
It's not completely finished now. We still need some more translations and artwork and

17:46.340 --> 17:53.720
there are some remaining bugs but actually it's already working and use it daily.

17:53.720 --> 17:57.440
How are you guys seeing response from a user base? Are you seeing people circle around

17:57.440 --> 18:06.480
and get excited? We've had a really huge uptake from our recent

18:06.480 --> 18:14.080
release. You got to understand that before it was LXQT, it was Razer Qt. Razer Qt already

18:14.080 --> 18:20.640
had its own kind of community. LXQT really is the continuation of that. It was just kind

18:20.640 --> 18:24.440
of on the back burner for a while. So are you guys, being honest with me, are

18:24.440 --> 18:28.480
you on a Qt holy war or is this one of these things that you were looking at it from a

18:28.480 --> 18:32.260
practical standpoint. You said, I like the direction Qt is going in. I think we could

18:32.260 --> 18:38.600
build a compelling desktop around it. This is a major going from a GTK based desktop

18:38.600 --> 18:45.480
switching over to Qt, merging two popular projects. Is there a larger motivation there

18:45.480 --> 18:51.520
PC Man? Yes, actually we are. One of the reasons is

18:51.520 --> 19:04.680
the GTK3. When we try to port LXDE to GTK3, we encounter many problems and some APIs are

19:04.680 --> 19:17.360
changed and some even with different behavior and the themes are changed too. So actually

19:17.360 --> 19:24.760
it's not very backward compatible. So was the sense that it was moving away from

19:24.760 --> 19:29.420
being a toolkit for all and maybe a toolkit specific for the GNOME desktop and since you

19:29.420 --> 19:32.920
weren't necessarily interested in creating the GNOME desktop, you needed to move something

19:32.920 --> 19:40.800
that gave you more flexibility and a quote unquote freedom? Am I grokking?

19:40.800 --> 19:47.640
Pretty much correct. This is pretty much what we've seen from a lot of GTK developers who

19:47.640 --> 19:55.520
feel that GTK is becoming way too GNOME centric. This was the experience of the LXDE desktop

19:55.520 --> 20:06.600
but on the Razer side of things, we just like Qt. We've always been Qt developers and we

20:06.600 --> 20:11.800
want to continue being Qt developers. So it was kind of just two projects with the same

20:11.800 --> 20:15.960
goals. Right. And you guys seem to be positioning

20:15.960 --> 20:20.020
the desktop in a pretty good spot. There's a lot of people who are seeing these trends

20:20.020 --> 20:23.520
that are interested in Qt development and I think that's a big one. I think people that

20:23.520 --> 20:26.760
are looking to switch to Linux that are interested in Qt development but they're also interested

20:26.760 --> 20:32.400
in having a more minimal desktop experience. And when you guys decided to go forward with

20:32.400 --> 20:39.080
the merger, was it with this sort of 50,000 foot view of, well, this is the way the landscape

20:39.080 --> 20:43.760
is going and so we should make this merger or was it, this is what I want to do and now

20:43.760 --> 20:51.240
just by happenstance, you guys seem to be in this really great position for the desktop?

20:51.240 --> 20:58.700
I'll take this one. Basically, when we decided to merge, the LXDE Qt project was just getting

20:58.700 --> 21:08.000
started and it was based on a lot of Razer Qt parts and on the side of Razer Qt, we had

21:08.000 --> 21:15.840
a lot of problem developer wise. We had about four or five active developers and it kept

21:15.840 --> 21:21.280
cycling between people leaving the project and people joining the project so we never

21:21.280 --> 21:28.600
really had a solid team. So the merger was really from a need of having more activity

21:28.600 --> 21:35.800
and was really successful in that sense. How many people are working on the LX Qt project

21:35.800 --> 21:45.760
at this point? I would say about a dozen but as I said, we've had a lot of uptake recently.

21:45.760 --> 21:51.320
Any talks of like a commercial sponsor who might provide funding for some full-time development?

21:51.320 --> 21:59.440
You guys been approached? No approach? No?

21:59.440 --> 22:05.720
We've not really had, I mean, some people contacted us not directly for sponsoring but

22:05.720 --> 22:14.440
we're definitely open to it and a couple of our community members want to fund the project

22:14.440 --> 22:18.660
as well. Great. The other really great use I could see

22:18.660 --> 22:25.960
for LXQt are enterprise desktops where they want a cute environment and they don't necessarily

22:25.960 --> 22:31.720
need Gnome 3 or full KDE. These are just business class machines. Perhaps a more traditional

22:31.720 --> 22:37.000
interface is actually a performance or I guess a productivity improvement. It's a good thing

22:37.000 --> 22:43.820
for productivity to be a little more classical. To me, I could seriously see commercial entities

22:43.820 --> 22:49.640
getting interested in wanting to encourage LXQt's development because imagine a CentOS

22:49.640 --> 22:57.000
based distribution around the LXQt desktop. It's like this is your iron solid bullet proof

22:57.000 --> 23:02.320
desktop that looks and works a lot like your old XP machine did but this is now you guys

23:02.320 --> 23:05.880
are a Qt development shop. This is a made up scenario but here's your Qt development

23:05.880 --> 23:09.560
shop. Here's a great desktop that works for you.

23:09.560 --> 23:13.160
Then of course, it's for enthusiast users who want to eek the most performance for games

23:13.160 --> 23:17.200
and things like that but still want to feel like they're not totally stuck in the 90s.

23:17.200 --> 23:20.960
I think it's a very interesting project, guys. Was there anything you wanted to mention or

23:20.960 --> 23:27.320
touch on from our review that we did on Sunday or any follow up before I let you guys go?

23:27.320 --> 23:34.440
I wanted to say I really liked the review. I watched it yesterday. I really liked the

23:34.440 --> 23:42.560
review. The KDE system settings, you were talking about system settings, having three

23:42.560 --> 23:48.400
or four different system settings and you actually reviewed the KDE system settings

23:48.400 --> 23:50.640
not the actual LXQt one.

23:50.640 --> 23:57.400
It's hard to tell when you do it on an Ubuntu installation. At the same time, I also felt

23:57.400 --> 24:02.440
like LXQt was sort of like, hey, whatever you want to use to configure. I didn't feel

24:02.440 --> 24:07.360
like I was being forced to use a specific set of configuration tools too. Is that intentional

24:07.360 --> 24:15.440
or is that just where things are at right now?

24:15.440 --> 24:16.440
What do you mean?

24:16.440 --> 24:20.600
Well, for example, it seemed to me like, and I don't know if this was just the PPA archive

24:20.600 --> 24:26.460
that I was pulling it from, but if I wanted to use the KDE settings to configure something,

24:26.460 --> 24:30.600
it seemed to work. It seemed to allow it for what I was doing at least. I was just curious

24:30.600 --> 24:35.920
if I know there's a modular aspect to LXQt. Is that the modular you mean? I can use this

24:35.920 --> 24:42.040
as my default file manager. I use this as my default configuration program for my whatever.

24:42.040 --> 24:48.120
Or will there be a very specific set of LXQt configuration tools that as the desktop matures,

24:48.120 --> 24:50.920
those are the ones you use regardless?

24:50.920 --> 24:59.480
Okay, it's modular, but it's not that modular as you think because part of this is because

24:59.480 --> 25:07.120
the design of Qt. When you run some KDE programs, you will notice that they do not apply the

25:07.120 --> 25:13.440
setting from your Qt config because they have their own module and doing this. KDE guys

25:13.440 --> 25:20.480
have their own platform plugin to improve integration with KDE, so their programs sometimes

25:20.480 --> 25:30.200
do not load the settings from Qt config, so you will have inconsistent settings among

25:30.200 --> 25:36.920
the Qt program sometimes, and it's hard to solve. We suffer from a similar problem because

25:36.920 --> 25:45.680
independent Qt programs sometimes load different settings than yours. We implemented Qt plugin

25:45.680 --> 25:54.680
to solve this, so there are still some limitations and some settings only apply to our desktop

25:54.680 --> 26:01.880
session, so not all of the tools can be used outside LXQt, but we will do our best to make

26:01.880 --> 26:02.880
it.

26:02.880 --> 26:06.000
All right, that makes sense. I understand how that could happen. Yeah, it seems like

26:06.000 --> 26:11.080
that, and that's probably something in a few years it'll get worked out on the Qt side.

26:11.080 --> 26:14.600
All right, guys. Well, thank you very much for coming on the show today. I really appreciate

26:14.600 --> 26:19.560
it. I know the times are a little crazy where you guys are at, and all over the world too

26:19.560 --> 26:24.920
at that, especially PC man. I really appreciate it, and keep up the awesome work on the Pac-Man

26:24.920 --> 26:30.340
file manager or the PC file manager. Anyways, that is a great file manager, and I'm loving

26:30.340 --> 26:35.880
the Qt implementation, so great work on that. Matt, I've got a little question I want to

26:35.880 --> 26:39.320
toss towards the audience that's going to help inform this Sunday's Linux action show.

26:39.320 --> 26:47.400
In fact, it's a bit of a survey. It's something I want to talk about. We've talked before

26:47.400 --> 26:53.000
on the Linux action show about building the ultimate Linux home server, and in the past

26:53.000 --> 27:00.560
our builds have always been Ubuntu-based, 1204 and 1210, somewhere in there, and so

27:00.560 --> 27:06.000
now that we're over at JB1, we've been sort of building out a new server infrastructure.

27:06.000 --> 27:11.760
We've got a free NAS here. It's a free NAS mini from IX Systems. Then we have in front

27:11.760 --> 27:16.280
of that a Proxmox machine. It's running multiple different instances, and I'm going to go into

27:16.280 --> 27:22.240
more detail on the big show, of Linux in front of that free NAS VM, and we're loading up

27:22.240 --> 27:28.800
different services on there, and I kind of want to ask the audience what makes your perfect

27:28.800 --> 27:33.200
Linux server. If you're going to load on your house or something like that, so I just put

27:33.200 --> 27:38.960
the link to the survey in the chat room if people want to fill that out, and while they're

27:38.960 --> 27:41.920
doing that, while they're answering the questions, it's a pretty quick survey, while they're

27:41.920 --> 27:46.480
answering those questions, I want to tell you about our second sponsor this week, and

27:46.480 --> 27:51.200
that is Ting. What is Ting? Ting is mobile. It makes sense. It's my mobile service provider

27:51.200 --> 27:55.280
and Matt's mobile service provider, and you know what we love about Ting? You only pay

27:55.280 --> 27:59.720
for what you use. I know it sounds insane. It sounds impossible. There's no way you only

27:59.720 --> 28:04.400
pay for what you use, but that's what's great about Ting. It's $6 a month for every line

28:04.400 --> 28:08.960
you have, and then just any applicable taxes, and your usage on top of that. I know. You're

28:08.960 --> 28:11.520
like, Chris, that's too good of a deal, and I'd be like, well, listener, how come you

28:11.520 --> 28:15.880
don't trust me by this point, but if you don't believe me, maybe you'd believe Kyra.

28:15.880 --> 28:19.960
Ting keeps rates simple. We don't make you pick a plan. Instead, you just use your phone

28:19.960 --> 28:24.680
as you normally would. How much you use determines how much you pay each month. You can have

28:24.680 --> 28:29.240
as many devices as you want on one account. That's good, because when you use more, you

28:29.240 --> 28:34.560
pay less per minute, message, or megabyte of data. Your usage plus $6 per active device

28:34.560 --> 28:39.680
on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill. Simple. That's what we mean when we

28:39.680 --> 28:44.200
say mobile. That makes sense.

28:44.200 --> 28:47.880
One of the great things about Ting too is the Ting dashboard. As I've been a customer

28:47.880 --> 28:51.480
now for well over a year, I really, really appreciate this. The other thing that's really

28:51.480 --> 28:56.960
great about Ting is they're great at just blogging about what they're working on, what

28:56.960 --> 29:00.240
they're thinking about the industry as a whole. As somebody who follows this stuff, I like

29:00.240 --> 29:04.600
to be an informed consumer. I think this is one of also my favorite features. They had

29:04.600 --> 29:09.080
an interview with one of their sysadmins on their blog about how Ting uses data to make

29:09.080 --> 29:14.200
sure that when they make a rate change, everybody is getting a good return on that change. I

29:14.200 --> 29:17.480
think it's a really interesting and fascinating way that they do this. You can watch that

29:17.480 --> 29:22.400
over on their blog. They're also helping out with budget tips. This is something they think

29:22.400 --> 29:26.400
about a lot. They've got a new guy in who's doing blogs on finance tips and things like

29:26.400 --> 29:32.600
that in general. Of course, it includes saving money on your Ting account. Go over to linux.ting.com.

29:32.600 --> 29:35.240
That lets them know you heard about it right here on the Linux Unplugged show. I'll also

29:35.240 --> 29:40.240
get you $25 off. If you want to grab a Ting phone, they'll take $25 off your first phone

29:40.240 --> 29:44.400
if you already have a phone. If you're just going to switch over and you're going to port

29:44.400 --> 29:48.280
your phone, you're going to BYOD, they'll take $25 off your first month or they'll give

29:48.280 --> 29:52.400
you $25 credit that paid for more than my first month. Ting has a whole range of devices.

29:52.400 --> 29:58.280
They have the Sanyo 3810 Red starting at $52. You own this phone outright. Then you're only

29:58.280 --> 30:02.720
paying for your usage on top of that. You can get a feature phone, one of the best feature

30:02.720 --> 30:07.160
phones out there. These Sanyos are amazing with these really cool front displays where

30:07.160 --> 30:13.000
the clock shows through for $52. It's yours. You own it. It's not subsidized. There's no

30:13.000 --> 30:16.920
contract and there's no early termination fee. They've got a whole range of really great

30:16.920 --> 30:22.760
devices. Go over to linux.ting.com. Also try out that savings calculator. One of the things

30:22.760 --> 30:28.640
I realized is for about a year, I was saying, oh yeah, my cell phone bill was about $125.

30:28.640 --> 30:33.640
And Ann's just like, actually, you know your cell phone bill was $140 a month? When I plugged

30:33.640 --> 30:39.440
in my old cell phone bill to the savings calculator, it came out to $2,200 over two years that

30:39.440 --> 30:43.920
I'm saving. That's a new computer every two years right there just by switching to Ting.

30:43.920 --> 30:50.240
I could buy myself a fully loaded Ultra Pro every two years by switching to Ting. That

30:50.240 --> 30:55.640
was a massive statement because I realized I kind of was willing to make some sacrifices.

30:55.640 --> 31:00.100
I was willing to kind of get into a bad deal because I was honestly a little distracted

31:00.100 --> 31:04.080
by the shiny nature of smartphones and how cool they were. And then I got a couple years

31:04.080 --> 31:08.880
into it and I said, wait, what am I, $140 a month? What am I doing? I didn't even realize

31:08.880 --> 31:12.720
that's what I was spending. It didn't really click with me. I didn't realize it was that

31:12.720 --> 31:17.360
much money. And now looking back at it, what was I wasting my money on? I didn't get my

31:17.360 --> 31:22.240
value out of that. Linux.ting.com, go get the value out of your mobile service plan

31:22.240 --> 31:28.280
and a really big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. And by the way, no hold customer

31:28.280 --> 31:33.320
service. How awesome is that? You don't have to, if you call in between 8 a.m. or 8 p.m.

31:33.320 --> 31:38.160
Eastern time, you don't have to hold. And you know what? I really appreciate that. I

31:38.160 --> 31:41.440
really do. All right, Matt, I want to talk about the perfect home server. So here's what

31:41.440 --> 31:44.600
I've asked the audience and hopefully they're filling these out right now. So you're building

31:44.600 --> 31:49.200
a brand new Linux home server. You're using everything you've learned or heard about over

31:49.200 --> 31:55.280
the recent years. You're starting from scratch. What would you start with? So, oh, well, goodbye

31:55.280 --> 32:00.280
Matt. What would you start with is what I asked the audience. And so I put out the call.

32:00.280 --> 32:05.120
They're doing the survey right now. Hello, are you back? I am back. I have no idea what

32:05.120 --> 32:10.160
happened. I think, I don't know. Maybe the gremlins infected Skype. I don't know what

32:10.160 --> 32:16.360
happened. So I've asked the audience to go out and fill out that survey right now. This

32:16.360 --> 32:21.260
will help inform the Linux action show on Sunday. I'll incorporate some of their feedback.

32:21.260 --> 32:25.760
See what we get. I'm kind of curious what people, also I left a spot in there to just

32:25.760 --> 32:30.040
kind of describe your dream setup and all those kinds of things. So go out there, fill

32:30.040 --> 32:33.960
out that form. It's the perfect home server. And I'd be really curious to see what you

32:33.960 --> 32:36.720
guys would do and see if it lines up with, oh, we're already getting some results in

32:36.720 --> 32:42.040
right now. And by the way, you can see the results that I set in the form to allow people

32:42.040 --> 32:46.440
to see the results. So open media vault, looks like I'm getting an open media vault. Sabnzb,

32:46.440 --> 32:51.080
Plex, Subsonic. Oh yeah, Subsonic's a good one. I should have put that in the check box.

32:51.080 --> 32:57.080
BitTorrent Sync, File and Network Services, Couch Potato. So we're getting a lot. And

32:57.080 --> 33:00.600
also I asked folks if they would just avoid building a LAN server and maybe just do like

33:00.600 --> 33:05.680
a VPS, like a digital ocean droplet. But we'll see. We'll see where folks go on this. I'm

33:05.680 --> 33:13.280
kind of curious because what we've got set up here now at JB1 is a Proxmox rig sitting

33:13.280 --> 33:19.800
on an i7 box with some internal storage and then some NFS storage. And it's pretty neat

33:19.800 --> 33:23.480
because we set up an arch server. Yes, an arch server. I'm going to talk about more

33:23.480 --> 33:27.320
of that on Sunday while we're doing that. We set up an arch server and then we, you

33:27.320 --> 33:31.720
know, to save ourselves time down the road, made a template of it. And now we can just

33:31.720 --> 33:36.760
deploy these arch boxes. And so I've got one arch machine that's limited to two cores.

33:36.760 --> 33:41.120
And that way, like if it's doing things like BitTorrent Sync or Sab NZB Usenet downloads,

33:41.120 --> 33:45.000
it can't go too crazy. And then we've got an encoder box on there that's for Rekai to

33:45.000 --> 33:50.400
bang on for doing like a show encodings. And I just like, I said, just have at it. Do whatever

33:50.400 --> 33:54.360
you want. You get eight cores. You can use up as much. When Rekai wants to take over

33:54.360 --> 33:58.680
the rig, like he just logs into this one virtual machine that I set up for him and he gets

33:58.680 --> 34:04.600
full control of all of the resources. And it's this cool way to kind of provision stuff

34:04.600 --> 34:09.120
from one machine that, you know, isn't necessarily busy all the time. So why not? And what's

34:09.120 --> 34:13.900
really kind of, I did some testing on the machine with only two cores assigned to it

34:13.900 --> 34:19.640
and limited memory. We did an encode of this week's fo show and we were getting about 22

34:19.640 --> 34:24.960
frames per second. When we switched to the encoding machine and with the eight cores

34:24.960 --> 34:29.600
available and more RAM, it went up to 122 frames. We gained a hundred frames per second

34:29.600 --> 34:34.080
improvement on the encoding speed. So now we've got an arch box. We're doing, and this

34:34.080 --> 34:38.080
is even like optimized FFmpeg scripts yet. This is just the basic boxes. But now we're

34:38.080 --> 34:42.640
going to start doing multi machine encoding using this Proxmox VM. And I thought, no way

34:42.640 --> 34:47.480
are you going to encode inside a VM. That's crazy. You can't do that. Can't be done. No,

34:47.480 --> 34:52.400
but it's actually, it's working okay. It could be a little faster, but beggars can't be choosers,

34:52.400 --> 34:56.720
man. We, you know, you only, you only get so many. Yeah. All right. Well, I got a new

34:56.720 --> 35:00.160
segment I want to introduce here in just a second, but before we do that, I want to just

35:00.160 --> 35:05.480
mention we just got a few days left on the Koda radio, 100 hoodie and t-shirt teespring.com

35:05.480 --> 35:14.480
slash CR 100. We've sold 154. There is six days, four hours, 14 minutes and 23 seconds

35:14.480 --> 35:19.540
remaining until this shirt is no longer available. The hoodie, if you're in a cold area, might

35:19.540 --> 35:25.640
be the way to go. It is hot, is over 80 degrees at JB one right now, 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

35:25.640 --> 35:30.400
And so I'm looking at these red and orange Koda radio hoodies. Ange tells me the one

35:30.400 --> 35:36.680
that's selling the best is this kind of dark gray is doing really well. So go to teespring.com

35:36.680 --> 35:41.440
slash CR 100. Grab the limited Koda radio 100 shirt only available for a few more days

35:41.440 --> 35:46.560
just to celebrate Koda radio and hitting a hundred episodes in a row too. Maybe one day

35:46.560 --> 35:51.880
we'll have a Linux unplugged t-shirt up there, Matt. Nice. I'd love that. I can only dream.

35:51.880 --> 35:56.840
So go get it while you can at teespring.com slash CR 100. No, we're not making a bunch

35:56.840 --> 36:00.880
of money. This isn't a fundraiser shirt. We just did a limit of a hundred and we just

36:00.880 --> 36:04.600
wanted something for the fans to be able to grab it. And I wanted some new shirts because

36:04.600 --> 36:09.940
it's getting hot out there. So this isn't like any big money raiser, but it's still

36:09.940 --> 36:14.680
a fun way to kind of celebrate. You know what I mean? All right, Matt. Well, it's time for

36:14.680 --> 36:20.280
us to own up. We got to look at the results. Hazel Bishop's new longer lasting lipstick.

36:20.280 --> 36:25.680
The only lipstick I found that stays on beautifully all around the clock. Now that wasn't what

36:25.680 --> 36:29.840
I was talking about at all. I don't know where that came from. You know, I have been considering

36:29.840 --> 36:34.420
changing my lipstick. All around the clock, Matt. All around the clock. No, actually what

36:34.420 --> 36:40.360
it's really time for is our all hands on board round table. We asked the live stream before

36:40.360 --> 36:47.160
we started, which topic would you like our round table to discuss? The antivirus pioneer

36:47.160 --> 36:52.380
Alan Solomon who thinks antivirus is dead and now he switched to Linux or the orange

36:52.380 --> 36:58.300
box, a $12,000 Ubuntu cluster. Now, Matt, what can you say about our audience when I

36:58.300 --> 37:02.340
do a poll? What usually ends up happening, Matt? What do you usually get when we ask

37:02.340 --> 37:05.920
our audience? What do you guys think about something? You know, I'm going to probably

37:05.920 --> 37:09.320
roll off the hardware. I could be wrong. Yeah, I think we should because this is a

37:09.320 --> 37:17.640
50-50 split right here. Our first one falls on its face. I said we would go with whichever

37:17.640 --> 37:22.000
one polled ahead. 220 votes. You know what? I'm going to put that in the chat room. I'm

37:22.000 --> 37:26.960
going to put it to a vote right now. We can have one person tip the scale. If you go to

37:26.960 --> 37:33.640
right now live stream, go to strawpoll.me, slash 16-87-395. Go over there and tip it

37:33.640 --> 37:39.040
one way and then that'll be our topic. They're both really interesting. However, I personally

37:39.040 --> 37:44.760
think the Ubuntu one is slightly more interesting, but that's just me. All right, here we go.

37:44.760 --> 37:51.460
The poll has been tipped to the Ubuntu orange box, 113 votes out of 223 votes. Ubuntu orange

37:51.460 --> 37:59.320
box got 51% of the votes and the Antivirus guy got 49% of the votes. All right, Mumble

37:59.320 --> 38:04.560
Room, so why don't we let Popey go first? Popey, can you tell us what the orange box

38:04.560 --> 38:12.920
is and why it looks so damn cool? So it's a box that was designed by Canonical and built

38:12.920 --> 38:20.320
by a company called Tranquil PC in the UK. It's got a bunch of Intel NUCs inside, which

38:20.320 --> 38:28.200
are i5 computers that are passively cooled. It's got a gigabyte switch and the idea is

38:28.200 --> 38:33.120
that you could use it as basically a cloud in a box. You could carry it around. It goes

38:33.120 --> 38:39.960
in a flight case and you could cart it to a location and build a cloud locally, a private

38:39.960 --> 38:47.480
cloud, no NSA snooping for you. And yeah, you're off and running with one box, one bright

38:47.480 --> 38:54.460
orange box. So it has what, like 10 NUCs stuffed inside this orange box and then it has a gigabit

38:54.460 --> 39:01.280
switch integrated in this box and a USB hub, right? Yeah, it's impressive actually. We

39:01.280 --> 39:05.320
saw it in the office a couple of months ago. Well, I saw it in the office and a bunch of

39:05.320 --> 39:12.400
us were kind of peering in because they had the lid off and it was quite impressively

39:12.400 --> 39:16.880
built. The guys at Tranquil PC have done a really nice job building this thing and I

39:16.880 --> 39:21.800
know that at the time when they built it, I think it was a one off. Well, more than

39:21.800 --> 39:26.480
one off because I saw two of them in the office. Well, so here's the specs. Okay, so it's 10

39:26.480 --> 39:33.480
Intel NUCs, specifically the Ivy Bridge D53427RKE model, rolls off the tongue, with an i5-3427U

39:33.480 --> 39:40.440
CPU. It's got an HD 4000 graphics, 16 gigs of RAM in each NUC, a 20 gigabyte SSD, Intel

39:40.440 --> 39:45.060
Gigabit NIC, and then they've got a D-Link gigabit switch in there with VLAN set up.

39:45.060 --> 39:49.900
All 10 nodes are internally connected to that gigabit switch in aggregate. This micro cluster

39:49.900 --> 39:56.520
effectively fields 40 cores, 160 gigabytes of RAM, 1.2 gigabytes of solid state storage,

39:56.520 --> 40:01.360
and is connected over internal gigabit network. A single fan quietly cools the power supply

40:01.360 --> 40:06.080
while all other nodes are passively cooled by aluminum heat sinks spanning the side of

40:06.080 --> 40:10.760
the chassis. And then the first node, which is called node zero in the box, also has an

40:10.760 --> 40:17.320
Intel Centrino Advanced N6235 Wi-Fi adapter, a two terabyte spinning hard drive, USB and

40:17.320 --> 40:21.600
HDMI ports are wired and accessible from the rear of the box, and access to the USB and

40:21.600 --> 40:28.260
HDMI of nodes one through nine are accessible under the unit. It also has six gigabit LAN

40:28.260 --> 40:31.680
ports all connected to that internal switch that the NUCs are all connected to, which

40:31.680 --> 40:33.800
is hooked up right there at the rear of the panel.

40:33.800 --> 40:35.600
Doesn't that just sound amazing?

40:35.600 --> 40:36.600
Yeah, it really-

40:36.600 --> 40:38.160
Sounds like a lot of fun.

40:38.160 --> 40:41.360
Like I've, you know, I've had some fun with the NUC recently, and I can tell you it's

40:41.360 --> 40:43.080
a serious machine. You know, it's-

40:43.080 --> 40:47.040
Yeah, so 10 of them must be 10 times the amount of fun, surely.

40:47.040 --> 40:51.920
All right, so round table, mumble room, anybody in here, what do you guys think? Could you

40:51.920 --> 40:57.420
see a use for an orange box like this? Could it be like, think about this, maybe like a

40:57.420 --> 41:01.800
portable data center? I think this is pretty exciting. Anybody think this is bogus? Anybody

41:01.800 --> 41:03.280
not excited by this?

41:03.280 --> 41:10.160
Actually, I could think of several applications for something like this. For instance, you

41:10.160 --> 41:15.800
know, for a doctor's office record keeping offsite, you know, that kind of thing. It

41:15.800 --> 41:18.040
definitely has a use.

41:18.040 --> 41:21.760
And I could see like two, like you could do everything working together in like one big

41:21.760 --> 41:26.520
cluster or you could have one machine's the web server, one machine's the database server,

41:26.520 --> 41:28.040
one machine's the file server, right? You could-

41:28.040 --> 41:30.280
One's the Quazel server.

41:30.280 --> 41:37.480
One's the Quazel server, exactly. I think this is a pretty compelling idea. And I think

41:37.480 --> 41:43.760
it's interesting to kind of demonstrate maybe in a way how you could have extremely high

41:43.760 --> 41:50.200
powered servers in a very small little container like this. You think about it, like the price

41:50.200 --> 41:55.360
isn't that crazy. So it starts at, what, 7,500 euros and then depending on how you configure

41:55.360 --> 41:59.000
it, the price is going to go up in there. But I mean, you can get a Mac Pro for that

41:59.000 --> 42:02.280
price, right? And this is 10 machines in one box.

42:02.280 --> 42:09.440
Yeah, Mark Shuttleworth unveiled it at the OpenStack conference in his keynote today.

42:09.440 --> 42:13.960
And yeah, it's certainly had a lot of attention as a result.

42:13.960 --> 42:17.160
Yeah, so there is an OpenStack thing going on right now. So I guess this was sort of

42:17.160 --> 42:21.480
the big, this was the big show for Canonical, wasn't it?

42:21.480 --> 42:22.480
One of them, yeah.

42:22.480 --> 42:25.000
Oh, is there something else going on there?

42:25.000 --> 42:34.400
Yeah, so Mark has a lot of the times he does a big tech demo or announces some new product.

42:34.400 --> 42:39.120
And I think he gave two things away. One was the orange box and another was the fact that

42:39.120 --> 42:44.520
there's the most powerful machine on the planet, the most powerful computer on the planet in

42:44.520 --> 42:50.240
China happens to run Ubuntu on OpenStack, which is quite cool, really.

42:50.240 --> 42:53.560
That is quite cool. Although I think we covered that in the Linux action show, so Mark should

42:53.560 --> 42:57.040
watch last. That's all I'm saying. All right, hold on. I think I have the keynote that you

42:57.040 --> 43:00.440
linked us earlier. Let's see if it'll play. I don't know if I have the audio from it or

43:00.440 --> 43:04.840
not because I had to hook this machine up during the show. But it was pretty funny because

43:04.840 --> 43:09.760
Mark was on stage revealing this orange box and he had it under a big curtain, like a

43:09.760 --> 43:16.360
big sheet. So there's this big black sheet on stage with Mark Shuttleworth and he's walking

43:16.360 --> 43:19.280
around it. He's not really drawing a lot of attention to it. And then at one point when

43:19.280 --> 43:23.760
he introduces the orange box, when he starts talking about it, he pulls off the sheet and

43:23.760 --> 43:27.200
then it's like, huzzah, here it is. It was a pretty good moment.

43:27.200 --> 43:28.560
He loves the big reveal.

43:28.560 --> 43:31.800
We'll have the keynote linked in the show notes. And Popeye was nice enough to give

43:31.800 --> 43:36.080
us right to the time index so you can watch that big reveal since I didn't have it set

43:36.080 --> 43:40.760
up for the show today. I apologize. Yeah, but I think it's a pretty neat thing. I mean,

43:40.760 --> 43:44.440
the antivirus thing is a cool story too, but I felt like the antivirus thing is we already

43:44.440 --> 43:49.040
kind of knew that. That guy was just saying stuff we already knew. Look at that, master

43:49.040 --> 43:50.040
HDMI. That's so cool.

43:50.040 --> 43:54.240
Here's the mirror to our question though. Can it play Minecraft?

43:54.240 --> 43:56.360
I think it could. I think it could. Although it is-

43:56.360 --> 44:00.320
Oh man, think how many Minecraft servers you could have inside that one box.

44:00.320 --> 44:05.040
The problem is that HD4000 might be your limiting factor. I don't know.

44:05.040 --> 44:10.400
What is a server? You could have a cluster of Minecraft servers in that box.

44:10.400 --> 44:12.960
I'm thinking this is our new encoding rig, right? We just-

44:12.960 --> 44:13.960
There you go.

44:13.960 --> 44:14.960
That's not what I was thinking.

44:14.960 --> 44:19.440
Yeah, we do a little GNU parallel scripting and go in there and get ffmpeg running across

44:19.440 --> 44:22.920
all 10 NUCs and then it spits out a file in two seconds.

44:22.920 --> 44:27.640
Oh man, I totally want one of those down.

44:27.640 --> 44:34.920
Yeah. I find it compelling that it's just that single fan in the back too. They've obviously

44:34.920 --> 44:39.080
taken every NUC. They're not even getting NUCs in the cases. They're like motherboard

44:39.080 --> 44:41.000
NUCs mounted inside this thing.

44:41.000 --> 44:46.000
They're all out of the boxes and they're all mounted on the side. There's a picture on

44:46.000 --> 44:52.920
the Tranquil PC side of it upside down with the bottom off so you can see inside. All

44:52.920 --> 44:57.680
the NUCs are mounted along, there's five on each side, I think, and they're mounted so

44:57.680 --> 45:00.960
that the heat is dissipated through the outside of the case.

45:00.960 --> 45:03.720
I was trying to find that on their website, but I don't see it. Yeah, because I saw that

45:03.720 --> 45:08.800
on one of the Ubuntu announcement pages, but I don't see it on the Tranquil PC site. When

45:08.800 --> 45:12.920
you saw this, does it look like they're actually buying full straight up NUCs from Intel and

45:12.920 --> 45:18.520
then pulling them out of the boxes or does Intel sell them to OEMs just as the boards?

45:18.520 --> 45:19.520
Did you get a sense?

45:19.520 --> 45:26.560
I don't know. Tranquil PC build them. We contracted them to build them and they deal with all

45:26.560 --> 45:29.640
that kind of stuff. I don't know whether they have someone sat there with a screwdriver

45:29.640 --> 45:34.040
taking them out of the cases or whether they have a deal with Intel. I really don't know.

45:34.040 --> 45:38.840
I like the idea though. I do like the idea that just a whole bunch of guys are at Canonical

45:38.840 --> 45:42.960
and they get a big shipment of these things and they sit there and just take them out

45:42.960 --> 45:46.000
of the box and they hook them up to this thing. I think that's a kind of funny idea.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.440
I'll tell you what, there's a whole pile of empty NUC boxes you can chuck on eBay if you

45:50.440 --> 45:51.440
wanted to.

45:51.440 --> 46:00.360
Well, I'm showing this picture, this image from a NUC right now. You know what? Rekai,

46:00.360 --> 46:04.960
our production pipeline guy calls it the glue for the studio. It's like when you need to

46:04.960 --> 46:09.040
hook two things up, you need a box in one place, you just stick a NUC there and it's

46:09.040 --> 46:14.760
the perfect glue because it's small, it's tiny in terms of the space it takes up on

46:14.760 --> 46:19.840
the table is actually beneficial but also the amount of power it draws and the sound

46:19.840 --> 46:26.320
it makes is all very minimal. HDMI out is very nice. They've been really good rigs and

46:26.320 --> 46:32.320
I love the idea too of not just having multiple cores but having multiple machines and then

46:32.320 --> 46:35.280
having the ability to either have them all work together independently. I think it's

46:35.280 --> 46:36.680
kind of a neat deal.

46:36.680 --> 46:40.680
Now I know what I want. Now I want one, Matt.

46:40.680 --> 46:41.680
Oh boy.

46:41.680 --> 46:42.680
Oh boy.

46:42.680 --> 46:46.120
I think System76 should get on there and then give us a review unit. That'd be great. You

46:46.120 --> 46:50.200
know what? Tranquil PC if you guys want to send us a review unit. I'm just saying Linux

46:50.200 --> 46:51.200
Action should take a look at that.

46:51.200 --> 46:52.200
You okay with that?

46:52.200 --> 46:53.200
Yeah, we could take a look at that. That'd be fine.

46:53.200 --> 46:54.200
Sure.

46:54.200 --> 46:58.160
I wouldn't mind. All right. Well, before we go, before we wrap up today's show, I'd like

46:58.160 --> 47:01.440
to make a special request that you guys get out there. Oh, go ahead, Crash, if you had

47:01.440 --> 47:04.440
something you wanted to add. I just saw that you flagged me.

47:04.440 --> 47:11.000
I was just, I looked up the CPU that they have in those NUCs on the Intel Arc side.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
Yeah, are you about to?

47:12.000 --> 47:19.480
I noticed that they're actually one of the fully-enabled Intel CPUs. They've got all

47:19.480 --> 47:24.360
the virtual machine stuff and all the directed IO and all that sort of thing as well. So

47:24.360 --> 47:30.080
you think about for an office, like a small office that needs to run a bunch of machines,

47:30.080 --> 47:33.760
you could stick one of those in there. They're not going to be ultra-fast VMs.

47:33.760 --> 47:34.760
You specifically saw the-

47:34.760 --> 47:37.240
You could run 20 virtual machines on it.

47:37.240 --> 47:40.040
Right. You specifically saw it has VTXD support?

47:40.040 --> 47:44.280
Yeah, it's got everything. I'm just going to look on the site now.

47:44.280 --> 47:49.120
So the VTXD support's nice because then that means you can give direct access to hardware

47:49.120 --> 47:54.520
to the virtual machine, which is really nice for storage and stuff. So that's really cool.

47:54.520 --> 47:57.800
All right, well, there you go. We'll have links to all that stuff as well as the specs

47:57.800 --> 48:02.320
listed out. And if you're curious about that antivirus guy who switched to Linux, we also

48:02.320 --> 48:08.120
have that linked in the show notes. And I do want to ask you, if you do me a solid,

48:08.120 --> 48:11.760
help us make this Sunday's Linux action show even better.

48:11.760 --> 48:15.560
If you go over to the show notes, I have a link to the perfect home server form you can

48:15.560 --> 48:20.200
fill out at home and let us know what you would. And add your own descriptions and things

48:20.200 --> 48:25.480
like that and submit that. I'll be going over that. We're going to do, on Sunday, and now

48:25.480 --> 48:32.080
I am having some free NAS problems right now. In fact, if anybody is familiar with how to,

48:32.080 --> 48:36.920
on a free NAS box, just do a one-to-one swap out of a failed hard drive, I had my last

48:36.920 --> 48:42.760
non-Western Digital Red drive in my free NAS rig, died yesterday or the day before. I got

48:42.760 --> 48:47.320
the overnight drive replacement, I put the drive in, and free NAS does not have any interface

48:47.320 --> 48:51.840
for just doing a swap of a drive. It still thinks the drive that died is still attached

48:51.840 --> 48:55.240
to the pool, and so the pool is still all screwed up and the machine is locking up.

48:55.240 --> 49:00.880
It's a free NAS catastrophe. So if anybody out there has any ideas or tips, I'd appreciate

49:00.880 --> 49:04.280
that. Or if there's anything else you want to comment or give us a topic to chew on,

49:04.280 --> 49:08.700
go over to jupitabroadcasting.com and click that contact link, and then choose Linux Unplugged

49:08.700 --> 49:12.200
from the dropdown and send in your feedback to us. We'd love to start out the show with

49:12.200 --> 49:17.200
a little bit of that. You can also go over to our subreddit, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

49:17.200 --> 49:22.320
And don't forget, you can also join us live over at jblive.tv. We do this show Tuesdays

49:22.320 --> 49:27.920
at 2 p.m. Pacific. You can get that converted to your local time zone by going over to jupitabroadcasting.com

49:27.920 --> 49:33.520
slash calendar. Alright, Matt, so here's what you've got to get thinking about, alright?

49:33.520 --> 49:38.440
You're thinking about what it would take to have Matt Hartley's perfect home server. Like

49:38.440 --> 49:43.160
is it Plex on there, right? Yeah, I'm going to have to think about that. I have a couple

49:43.160 --> 49:48.880
ideas. Yeah, so we'll talk about that on Sunday. We'll get the audience's ideas, and on top

49:48.880 --> 49:52.540
of that, you'll see what we've come up with here at JB1 for the new setup. We've got some

49:52.540 --> 49:57.320
pretty cool stuff we're doing, and it's kind of nuts how awesome this technology's gotten.

49:57.320 --> 50:02.200
So we'll cover the perfect arch server on Sunday show, our ideas, plus the community's

50:02.200 --> 50:06.200
ideas. So go over to the show notes for Linux Unplugged 40, find that Google Doc form, and

50:06.200 --> 50:09.160
fill it out for us if you would. Alright, everyone, well thanks so much for tuning this

50:09.160 --> 50:13.760
week's episode of Linux Unplugged. If we don't see you on Sunday for the big show, we'll

50:13.760 --> 50:42.760
see you right back here next Tuesday. Bye, everybody!
