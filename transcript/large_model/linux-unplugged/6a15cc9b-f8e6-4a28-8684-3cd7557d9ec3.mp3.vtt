WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
So Dan, how's it working now?

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
I think it's working.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
You sound awesome.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Good job. Well done, sir.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Are you using that newfangled elementary OS I've heard so much about?

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Okay, so I was

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
on the experimental

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
artful build that is super

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
unstable, and so every time I opened

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Mumble, it would just destroy my session.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
It would just crash. Oh, man.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Oh, dear. Yeah, so I came back to stable

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
and everything works.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
So is that a yes?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Yes.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
I'm glad we sorted that.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
I'd just like to point out

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
one week away from release, and I'm using

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Ubuntu Mate 17.10. Oh, boom!

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
It's fine.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
This is

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Linux Unplugged, episode 218

00:46.000 --> 01:00.000
for Tuesday, October 10th, 2017.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Linux talk show that's been carrying around

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
multiple laptops for weeks.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. And hello,

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Beardsley. Hey, how's it going?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
So guys, we have a pretty great show today.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Finally gonna get

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
to sit down and review the

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Librem 15, the latest

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
and greatest from Purism,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
which kind of the timing's sort of

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
perfect, because also

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
there's some big news around the funding for Librem 5.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
So we'll be taking a look at one

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
of their products that initially was a crowd

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
funder at just the moment

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
that the Librem 5 hit its crowdfunding

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
goal. Very interesting to see where something

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
like this they've worked on a couple years, where are they at?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
How far did they get if they had a couple years to work

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
on something? Also,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
really, really big community news

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
that I want to cover this week, and we're gonna

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
roll out an experimental new segment as

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
part of that community news. Controversial,

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
the beard tells me. Prepare to be

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
flamed, the beard warns me.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Didn't you? He did. I did.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
So we will roll out a new corner

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
of the show this week to talk

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
about something that's here, it's real,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
and we're all dealing with it.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
And it's spelled with a lowercase d. That'll

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
be coming up in a little bit. And then

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
after all of that, if

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
time permits,

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
this show is in a special moment

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
right now. It is

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
32 episodes away from

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
250. And why

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
do you say that matters? Why does that matter? Is that what you might be wondering?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Why does that matter, right? Isn't that just a number?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah, well it is, and I couldn't wait till 300,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
that's why it mattered. So 250

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
is just 32 episodes

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
away, and it is time

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
for

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
some changes. We're switching

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
to Haiku. Boom.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
So if you're a fan of this show, following

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
the show for a while, I encourage you to stick around towards

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
the end of the show. We'll talk a little bit

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
about some of the changes that could be coming down the road

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
around 250, around

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
episode 250, so we'll give you a long time

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
to digest it all. But never fear,

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I think it's all for the better.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Before we go any further, we gotta cover some community

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
news, and there is one order of business

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
that we must take care of before we go there.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
And that's bringing in our virtual

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
log. Time appropriate greetings!

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Mamba room! Hello!

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Hello!

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Well I'm like William Shatner getting thrown

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
across his bridge right now with that one.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
We got some excited people. They're fired up and ready

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
to go. There you go. I'll tell you what I'm fired

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
up about. One of the projects

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
that has one of the worst names in recent history

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
but is so damn useful, FW

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Update.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Firmware update, FWupd, just hit

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
version 1.0. Now this is

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
that special little bit of magic

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
that's a lot of good software

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
but also a lot of really great

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
partnerships and relationships

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
that have resulted in Linux

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
users getting firmware

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
updates to critical pieces of hardware in their

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
machine via software updates

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
like any

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
modern desktop system does in 2017.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
And they just hit version

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
1.0. Since they've

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
started the project, they've basically re-architected

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
the way the entire daemon works. They've re-imagined

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
how the metadata is downloaded and managed.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
They've changed core ways of the way

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
things themselves are done with the upgrades.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
They now support 72 different kinds of

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
hardware with support for another

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
dozen or so currently being worked

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
on. And lots

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
of vendors are now using the LVFS

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
project to distribute firmware.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Now LVFS project stands for

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
the Linux Vendor Firmware Project.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Every month

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
165,000 plus

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
devices get updated using

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
FWupdate.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Now that is some good progress.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah, yeah. Del, as you

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
might know if you've followed some of our coverage here

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
on this network, has been a huge supporter, they write,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
since the early days. Now smaller

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
companies like Logitech are also supporting the

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
project. And he also gives a shout out to his

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
employer Red Hat who's given him the

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
resources and infrastructure and some of the

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
political handshaking that

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
has been needed that he said literally no one else would have given

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
him. And he's extremely grateful.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
So this is huge.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
This is one of those little bits of software

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
that doesn't have a really flashy name.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
You know, if this was something that like Max didn't

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
have and then all of a sudden

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
they got this feature, they would give

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
it some sort of great name like

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Active Firmware Updates or something. Like it would have

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
some sort of publicity name and

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
it would be a feature in the OS that this

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
version of the OS finally supports.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
But in Linux land,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
it just slowly gets rolled out

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
and one day when you're on a Linux machine

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
and you're on Gnome Software Center

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
and you go to updates, you see there's a firmware update.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And you click it and you just installed your firmware update

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
and you don't think about the fact that you didn't have

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
to go download an exe from their horrible

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
driver's website. You didn't have to go find

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
some weird version of FreeDOS or something like that.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Like it just worked.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
And that's why this project's so great.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
And it's really great to see them hit version 1.0.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
And there's a lot of devices on that

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
list. You should go check. Tons of Dell things.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
The Color Hug, the Logitech Unifying

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Receiver, which a lot of people probably use.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Like that's awesome. I'm hopeful

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
that Dell gets support for this

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
on some of their servers at some point because I think that would

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
be handy. Sure, there's usually like

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
TMI or other ways to do it, but it'd be awesome to be able to do it

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
just from your regular old

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
operating system. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
So I have a segment that I want to

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
roll out. A corner, if you will. It's for people who like

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
to mess with computers. Now I'm going to call this

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
the System D Corner and

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
the value of this is negative.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I apologize if you're not a System D

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
fan. I understand. It is a bit

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
of a complex beast.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
But it is the reality in which we

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
find ourselves today. And there have been some

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
interesting developments in System D land.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
And I thought since most of us are going to be

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
running a version of Linux that uses it,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
maybe we should know what those things are.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
So we now dive

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
into the complex and

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
inspired world of System D.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
And there's some new features, Wes.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
There's some really nice new features. I

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
highlighted a few. Like one I thought that was

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
particularly neat was

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
dynamic users,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
which is coming to System D 2.35.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
And you can now configure

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
System D to dynamically allocate

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Unix user IDs for service

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
processes when they start.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
And then they release the user ID

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
when it stops them. It's pretty secure and it mixes well

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
with transient services. It works with

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
socket activated services and

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
with service templating.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
So instead of having to have user accounts sitting

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
around that could be exploited, user accounts

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
created. The UID that is

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
necessary is created. When the service

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
is done, it's destroyed. The other part I like about this

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
is not necessarily just the dynamic users

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
thing, but they talk a lot about the methods

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
that you have available with System D, like

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
it runs as a dynamic user and then you can

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
pick and choose either temporary or permanent

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
places on the file system to give it write access

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
to. And it won't be able to write outside of that,

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
which there's a ton of things I can think like, you know,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
much like snaps do in some ways where you're just like

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
you need to save your data in your

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
spot. I will go fetch it when I need it.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Don't touch anything else in my home.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Now there's something else that they've

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
added that I didn't really think about until

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I saw it as a feature and I'm like, oh, geez, I can't believe we

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
didn't have this. So System D analyzes

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
gain new verbs like get log level

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
and get log target,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
which will print the logging level

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
and the target of the system manager,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
which is if you think about what they're saying

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
here is now you can ask the system what

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
level in which are you logging at?

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
And you could not ask the system that before

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
this necessarily, but more so

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
than that, they're going to be able to expose this

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
to like GNOME logs up in the GUI

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
level. So you'll be able to open up your local desktop

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
log manager and see

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
your system is currently

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
logging at this level right now, which

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
that is kind of like one of those

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
I'm surprised we didn't have those features.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
And then here's another one in that category

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
for each service unit

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
for each time a service is restarted

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
there'll be a counter that is now

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
kept so you can keep track of

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
how often the service restarts. It's

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
increased each time the service is restarted

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
and you'll be able to

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
query like systemctl show

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
dash P number of restarts for

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
service X and you can see if your

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
nginx daemon is restarting

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
constantly and you get an idea of how many times that's

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
happened, which I think is just going to be really great

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
information. Then last

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
but not least, before we get out of the corner

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
you notice a little something

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
about kind of a clever way

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
that systemd murders people's system

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
processes and

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
murders them good. It really does

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
because it does it in a way where they don't make

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
a big fuss and then it can just go

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
and clean house after that because

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
and so

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
I don't mean I don't want to steal your thunder because you

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
found this one but I thought

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
this is pretty great the way they I guess they use sig stop

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
before a real signal completely

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
before it gets any other signals the

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
process gets any other signals that would prevent it

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
from closing like so before it can lock up

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
because it got another signal they sent it a sig

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
stop. The process suspends

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
and then you can

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
go in and you can just tell it all to die right

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
there on the spot and the ones that don't

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
die they'll come back they'll get

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
woken up and then you can generally go back and

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
clean them up in a loop and kill them again.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
It seems like it was just a really simple kind

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
of way to sort of kill processes and

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I thought okay well that was you put it in the slack

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
so I don't I didn't mean to steal it but what did you

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
no no I think just just it's just good

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
to see the implementation of

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
something simple for a common problem

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
like that I'm sorry I'm doing it again

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
but that's what it was is it was

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
something simple for system where otherwise we

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
give we attribute systemd as this huge

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
monster and this is just a really

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
clean plain simple way to do something right

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
like there's plenty of things systemd does wrong I

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
will not try to say that it's this perfect piece of

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
software anything like that but when they do things

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
right or if there's something interesting

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
it's interesting to see and I have not

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
dived that deep into the internals

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
so it's cool to see like a filtered version

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
a look inside yeah

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
yeah so something that

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I've noticed that you guys didn't mention

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
there's also systemd

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
run gain support for a new pipe

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
command which allows you

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
to invoke arbitrary

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
processes as systemd services

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
so you get all the benefits of systemd like the systemd

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
logging while still allowing

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
to be integrated into the classic unix

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
shell pipeline fascinating

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
that is a good catch yeah right yeah

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
so you can like spin up a pipeline give it

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
a give it like a temporary working

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
to store all of its stuff logs

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
to the journal and then have it all disappear

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
as a user that no longer exists there you go

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
there you go so okay everybody okay

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
did everybody make it did you did you survive

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I'm in a cold sweat now but let's

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
just carry on

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
all right and that concludes our systemd

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
corner I just I thought we were going to need

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
a theme for this I know music

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I'm just hacking it together as we go right now

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
but I thought somebody screaming about doing only

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
one job sort of was appropriate for systemd

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
because sort of you know

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
okay so it's too appropriate yeah

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
well it's kind of ironically appropriate

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
so before we run Mr. West

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Payne and I had a chance to go to seagull

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
this week last week actually

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
and Wes even had

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
a talk there which

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
I attended and this was my first time

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
going to seagull it's in Seattle

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
at the Seattle Central College

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
and it ran this last weekend and

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
a lot of our friends are there

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
oh yeah Valerie from

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
the Ubuntu

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
in Oregon and Katie I think she

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
actually probably with Katie she was there

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Ian from

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
System76 was there

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
as well and he gave a talk as well

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
as he sat in a booth and

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
yeah it was

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
not a huge event in fact it sort of

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
hit that sweet spot if you want something

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
that's not a very very large production

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
but still has really interesting informative

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
talks it sort of nails

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
that like I'll give you an example like

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
so while Wes was giving a talk on

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Clojure

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
there was also a talk on

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
on how to

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
set up like a key

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
pass set up with your own private

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
sync and encrypted backup

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
and in another room there was a talk about

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
how to wire an automated chicken

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
door using a Raspberry Pi

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
and like those were

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
the talks that were all going on at once

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
and it gives you sort of a it is like that all day

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
and almost every

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
talk there was something like I would really like to go to that

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
and so you gave one

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
what did you think what was that process like for you

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
was that your first talk at a Linux event

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
at a Linux event yes I've given others

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
other talks but at a Linux event yes it was a lot of

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
fun it was super easy when I was

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
submitting and preparing and saying like oh do I

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
want to try to give one here all the

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
people in their IRC room the people volunteers

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
people running it super nice super helpful

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
really it's just a great conference

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
I'm glad to have been a part I'm glad to have gone

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
to gone this year and I hope

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
you're right it wasn't super huge but

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I thought they got a good array like there's a lot of speakers

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
from not in this area Microsoft

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
was represented IBM had several people

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
there as you said system 76

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
so I think it's it's an up

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
newcomer hopefully something to watch and it

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
feels like you know Seattle's a big enough

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
tech hub with enough tech people

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
and companies there that it makes sense

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
for a Linux type event

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
like this to exist so

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
it sounds like this year went great

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I hope that keeps going yeah

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I found

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
it to be a little

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
smaller scale than like a Linux fest it was

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
more like a more like

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
a probably a crowd of like four or five hundred

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
yeah probably yeah and

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
it was at the venue was

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
a school Seattle Central College

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
and it was in session

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
so at certain times

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
you were walking around the hallways with college

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
students going between rooms

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
which not quite

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
my thing but not bad

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
either a little chaotic but not bad

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I guess they had to do some rescheduling too

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
there was like an HVAC problem so they had to change some

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
of the rooms that they were using at the last

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
minute I don't know if that played a role there's always

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
complications like that but either way

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
nice group of people nice group of

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
talks definitely worth the travel

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
if you're in the area so yeah

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
I'll probably go back for a bit next year too

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I got to meet up with a few Jupiter broadcasting

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
listeners so that was cool I like that

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
and then the year I went the fire

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
alarm went off so you guys lucked out

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
ouch

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
and then after it was all done

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Wes and I went to Angela's

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Angela's family diner oh

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
that was a ton of fun yeah so we went down to Planet Java

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
diner and we got chicken strips Wes and I

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
were adorable and got chicken strips to get twinsies

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
we totally went twinsies on lunch

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
and then and then you know what

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
we went and got cookies so it was actually

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
all around a pretty good time did you guys share

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
a milkshake no

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
no but those cookies

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
are worth getting they were super super

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
good so yeah it was Segal was a good event the Seattle

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
area is good if you can make it out

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
maybe go next year maybe

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
maybe and now and now we look forward my friends

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
now we look forward so there's

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
many things to chat about so let's take a moment

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
and thank Ting for sponsoring the unplugged

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
program go to linux.ting.com

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
to sign up and that's where you'll get $25

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
off a device or $25

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
in service credit if you bring a device

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
check their BYOD page

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
because over there they'll list all the devices

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
that are compatible and you'll be impressed with the list

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
because they have a CDMA network and

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
a GSM network they have a really

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
well designed dashboard where it

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
gives you a quick access to

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
your minutes your messages or

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
your megabytes whatever you've used or you could turn

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
a line off or you could turn a line

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
on and just use only text

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
or only use data or only use phone like

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
you have all these really different granular

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
levels of control you can

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
say usage alerts you can name

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
the line so you don't have to go by the numbers but you can go

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
by like a easy to know alias

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
and then that shows up across like the mobile

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
apps too it's really sophisticated

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
now here's the nice thing

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
about a $25 service credit

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
you see your average Ting line is going

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
to be around $23 $24

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
a month and that's after your minutes

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
and your messages and your megabytes are added up and the $6

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
for the line you're still going to be around

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
this pretty low price point

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
so if you get a $25 service credit it's going to

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
pay for more than your first month I really

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
really like that because that's what happened to me

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
and that that experience that

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
that made me a Ting customer for life

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
and of course they've got devices you can buy directly

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
like I said you can bring your own and if you're

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
watching their Twitter page and

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
you can find that at Ting FTW on Twitter

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
you'll see that they're giving away 2 gigabytes

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
of data right now if you add a line

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
to your Ting account you'll get 2 gigs

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
of free data so if you're

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
already a Ting customer check that out

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
if you're not go to

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
linux.ting.com linux.ting.com

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
and a big thank you

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
to Ting for sponsoring the Linux

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Unplugged program linux.ting.com nationwide

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
coverage with no contracts and no

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
early termination fees whoa

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
linux.ting.com

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
so you found this really great

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I think you found this this really great

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
unless the beard found it I'm sorry if I'm misattributing

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
but this really great app called

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Tor Proxy which uses net filter

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
hooks in the Linux kernel to route all

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
of your network traffic to the Tor

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
network it uses net filter

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
hooks and then it just

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
makes sure that all of your outbound

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
traffic that of course the kernel would be

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
responsible for anyways gets routed to

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
the Tor network now here's a major

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
limitation it only supports IP

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
4 traffic and it's TCP IP

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
4 so no UDP

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
fancy shenanigans no

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
IP v6 and no pings

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
no ICMP pings get those

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
out of here yeah get those out of here but this is

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
a pretty neat thing could you

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
could give me a use case for this West

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
give me your best spy use case for this

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
like what do you got like an always secure

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Linux box as soon as you turn it on the kernel

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
routes all your traffic to Tor like listen what's

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
going on yeah I mean that or

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
yeah maybe you're using a you have a virtual machine or

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
you have like a you know a laptop with no

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
OS that you boot this up you load the module

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
you make sure that you know at no time

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
are you going to be able to send

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
packets out there except

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
through Tor yeah or you want

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
to run an application over Tor that doesn't

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
support proxies inside of

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
the application sure yeah yeah that's

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
good I bet you that'd be a big use case yeah

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Tor proxy and it's a kernel

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
module which who doesn't love a load in a good

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
kernel module I like how

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I like how simple it is it only has four arguments

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
oh really good

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I like I was gonna say I like

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
that they tested against kernel 3.16

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
so I'm like oh okay

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
but what are they what are the arguments

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
well you have dash S which is to insert the module

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
and start the proxy you have

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
dash I which is just to insert the module

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
you have dash R which is to remove

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
the module and you have dash T which is

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
to refresh the relay tables

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
that's pretty simple

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
that's it I can get I can get behind

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
that that's how you build your ultimate secure box

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
somebody make a live CD that

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
does that the the downside is the proxy

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
must be run as root and Tor

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
must be running so

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
you are putting

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
something network enabled

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
on root yeah

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
yeah that is a downside

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I also noticed like if you want to get to any hidden

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
services you're still gonna have to use a Tor browser to

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
do that yeah but I guess that's kind of expected

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
so I saw a question

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
on our Linux and I

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I know I've had offline conversations

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
with Wimpy about this but I

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
figured it might be on the minds of

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
a lot of listeners out there and

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I did show I did see it show up on our Linux so I

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
thought well let's let's talk about this for a moment and

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
maybe Wimpy you could chime in

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
and share as much as you'd like

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I just want to find a game

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I think is or a name I think

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
is the person's handle on

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Reddit why did comp is die

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I don't understand people like

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
people act like comp is archaic or

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
maybe it's gimmicky and buggy that hasn't

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
been my experience at all I don't really understand

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
why it's gone away I like gnome shell

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
but I like comp is much much

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
more I'm actually going to jump to

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
XFCE and load

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
comp is and I don't understand why more people

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
and more distros haven't done this so

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Wimpy how did

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
comp is and why is comp is dead and is it dead

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
well no comp is

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
isn't dead there's there's effectively

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
two strands of comp is that

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
are being actively maintained right

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
now there is comp is not

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
point nine which is the comp is you'll

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
find in Ubuntu

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
for example and that's

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
the C++ re-implementation

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
so it was forked from

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
the 0.8 branch

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
a whole load of stuff was reworked

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
and all of the plugins that

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
are available there were

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
also made to work with

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
EGL so they work on

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
things like ARM devices and what have

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
you and then you have

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
comp is reloaded

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
which is based on the 0.8 branch

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
so pre the C++

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
re-implementation and

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
has a wider selection of plugins

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
available but not all of those

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
are available for EGL

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
and both of those projects are alive and

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
well Ubuntu

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Marte ships comp is 0.9

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
by default obviously Ubuntu

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
16.04 is shipping comp is because that's

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
where a lot of the Unity functionality

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
is

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
exposed

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
and I

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
think I'm right in saying that the Fedora

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Marte spin comes with

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
comp is reloaded

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
so you know it's funny because

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Veritunda makes the obvious joke

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
in the room and you're right Veritunda everybody

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
when you say comp is you think of things like

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
cubes or

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
the aquarium

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
my windows don't wiggle anymore wiggly windows

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
wobbly windows

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
yeah I mean if you've got no taste

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
then

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
those things are turned on by default

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
then Linux is the place to be

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
if you're actually using comp is for

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
you know feature enhancement then

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
maybe comp is

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
used a little bit more sensibly and

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
tastefully yeah that's always why I've liked

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
it is because it always gave my system

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
this feeling like it

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
was keeping up with me like the

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
smoothness to the window draws

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
and movements to the windows and

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
the fact that maybe my disk

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
might be busy but the windows would still

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
render rather cleanly and smoothly

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
to me that was always the

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
draw to comp is I think my

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
favorite comp is feature was actually

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
it was my first experience with

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
live previews

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
in your alt tab menu oh yeah

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
yeah and also like hover over

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
the icon and see like a

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
preview of your minimized window window

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
peaking yeah yeah there

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
is some genuinely useful functionality

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
in comp is and you know if you're

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
using a desktop environment which is

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
using X then

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
it's a great way to get

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
in most cases a tear-free

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
experience and also in

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
my experience I've been working on comp

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
is for just over two and a half

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
years now I don't find it

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
to be buggy or crashy you often see

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
throwaway comments you know in the various

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
or it steals a lot of frames per second

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
or memory oh it's you know it's crashy

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
and it's buggy well I don't

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
see that I use it all day

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
all the live long day for years

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
and I don't think I've ever seen

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
comp is actually crash

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
on me it's usually something else

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
yeah that causes you know

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
a disastrous failure it's not comp is

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I'm inclined to agree my

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
my main machine

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
is a 1604 machine so it's Unity

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
7 comp is based but

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
comp is I don't even think

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
about comp is on a daily basis

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I don't really think about Unity 7

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
on a daily basis it's just the

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
thing that puts windows on my screen and I tend

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
to leave my machine on all the time

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
and I get quite decent uptime

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
without my desktop

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
dying in any way shape or form

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
so yeah that might have been the case

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
some time ago and there may have been some instability

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
when comp is

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
0.8 transitioned over

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
to C++ in the 0.9

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
and the early days of Unity plugin

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
but these days

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I don't see it being anywhere

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
near as crashy

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
as people say in fact I

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
before I joined this hangout

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I was playing a

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
3D accelerated game

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
via Steam on one display

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
while displaying other stuff on

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
two other displays and everything

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
just worked perfectly and I didn't get any

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
rendering issues or crashing at all

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
it's just expected

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
that it just works and it does in 2017

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
it does yeah I've really had no problem with it

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
we have a machine here in the studio running

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Unity 7 on the LTS last

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
LTS release and I never

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
think about comp is I never give it two

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
thoughts the only thing I ever think about is the interface

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
always seems fairly responsive

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
and I appreciate that aspect

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
of the computer yeah definitely you know it gives me

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
it gives me some pause though now

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
that I think about this because you've

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
all just made really great points comp is still

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
maintained it technically does

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
something superior that we all

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
enjoy and while we have projects out there like

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
kwin which are great projects

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I still find projects like

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
comp is to still have a considerable amount of value

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
specifically for me

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
and how I use Linux just

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
you know for me personally I

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
like using a desktop with comp is

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
and I wish you

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
and millions of other people I wish there was a

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
way to have that with gnome 3

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
because

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
that's what I'm going to miss I think the most

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
about the transition for the

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Ubuntu desktop is

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
I was always one of the things I liked the most is when I would

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
load up a Unity 7 Ubuntu desktop

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
which I didn't use very often

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
but when I loaded it I was always like

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
gosh this thing is smooth and polished

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I think comp has played that role

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
and I admit I'm a little

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
biased at the moment because just before we went on air

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
gnome 3 crashed and we lost audio

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
on our live stream again and we're back

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
to having gnome 3 crashes after

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
weeks of things working great and

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
we've made no software changes at all

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
and yet we're now back to

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
having gnome 3 crashes so I do admit I'm

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
a little

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
but let's not get roasted into spectacles

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
when Ubuntu switched

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
to Unity it was pretty fraught

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
and Unity in the early days

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
and comps in the early days

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
was pretty unstable

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Yeah I guess I feel like I've gone through that though

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
I don't really feel like doing that again

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Right well you don't have to because the

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
1710 release is an interim release there's no

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
reason why you

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
as a normal user I don't mean you Chris as a

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
podcaster and a tech journalist I mean

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
a normal user would have to upgrade to

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
1710 they might do it out of curiosity and they might

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
run it in a VM or on a spare laptop but there's no

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
obligation to run it

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
other than curiosity so wait for

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
the 1804 release when things are a bit more

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
stable and the upstream gnome

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
developers have had a ton of

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
bugs filed by

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
quite a few Ubuntu users

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
who are enthusiastic and do want to

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
try this stuff early

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
but I think when you get to 1804

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
I think

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
given that Unity 7

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
has stabilized over the last

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
like 3 years 4 years or so

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
you picture where we'll be

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
with gnome shell in

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I don't know the 20

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
2020 LTS

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
release just think how rock solid that

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
2020 release I know that's quite

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
a hard picture for some people to grasp but

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
think how stable that's going to be

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
and that's effectively where we are with Unity 7

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
That's a good point

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
and that is the nice aspect

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
about LTS's and the fact that there's many

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
other desktops out there that

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
we do have

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
there are other islands

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
we can hop to and

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
time does seem to heal these wounds

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
so while we're talking about the march towards

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
1804

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
I noticed that the Ubuntu Mate

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
project has a very interesting

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
announcement in fact some of my friends on

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Twitter seem to be rather excited about this too

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Ubuntu Mate will be pioneering

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
a snap pre-installed

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
so when you install Ubuntu Mate

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
17.10 there will be a snap

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
pre-installed and it looks like

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
it's going to be the pulse audio mixer

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Wimpy can you tell me a bit about this?

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Yeah I can so

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
as of yesterday

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
I believe that landed so

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
you were at the Ubuntu rally

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
and this was one of the outcomes

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
of the Ubuntu rally which was

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
how do we

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
put the last pieces in place so that it's

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
possible to ship a snap

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
pre-installed by default

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
in the ISO images

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
and I was approached as

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Ubuntu Mate

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
to sort of sound

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
me out to see if we'd be able to do this

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
and work on this so that we could

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
learn some lessons

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
and feed that back to the

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Ubuntu desktop team proper

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
so they've got sight of

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
how things have gone and what

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
we've learned in readiness

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
for 1804. So

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
we've chosen to ship

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
the pulse mixer application

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
by default which is a

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
console based mixer for pulse

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
and in fact when I was

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
fumbling with my audio earlier

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
it was actually that that I used to

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
sort my volume levels out

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
because it's quite fine grained

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
in what it can do. So

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
that's now pre-installed by default

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
on the daily images so we've got a post

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
over at community.ubuntu.com

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
which is a

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
call for testing for anyone who's

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
interested in Ubuntu not necessarily

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Ubuntu Mate to come and grab

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
the daily images and test

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
it and make sure that that pulse

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
mixer application is working correctly.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
So there's a lot to what you just

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
said and this is

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
remarkable. So there's a lot

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
a listener could infer based

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
on this conversation so I think we should

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
be pretty clear. You

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
say you're shipping a snap in Ubuntu Mate

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
in preparation for 1804.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Now if I were an alarmist

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
I'd say that means that 1804 everything

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
is going to be snapped. That's not what's happening here right?

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
No there's no

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
plans for everything to be a snap in 1804

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
although you know

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
if there was a new flavor

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
to crop up where everything being

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
a snap made sense then

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
that would be possible. You know there could be some

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
interesting use cases for this sort of

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
thing like

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Ubuntu Kodi for example.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
You know you could have an Ubuntu Kodi

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
distribution where Kodi is

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
provided as a snap and is

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
permanently upgraded to the latest

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
stable release even though that you're

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
on an LTS that's you know running

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
for five years you know unchanging

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
but the core application

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
moves on top. That would be quite

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
a nice way to do this.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Or an Ubuntu kiosk

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
that has just like

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
the base install and a browser

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
and that's it and the

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
networking stack and everything is nicely

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
confined so someone coming up to use that kiosk

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
knows that nothing else is going to

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
infringe upon the data

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
that they're saving at that time.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
So why Pulse Audio Mixer

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
or Pulse Mixer

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
and

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
what does having it installed by

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
default what kind of

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
value does that have?

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Right well the particular

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
reason that this application has been

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
chosen is because until it

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
was a snap there was no easy way

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
to install this on Debian and Ubuntu

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
because this application has never been in the

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Debian or Ubuntu archives before

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
and in fact it was Popey spotted

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
what's called an ITP

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
on the Debian mailing list.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
An ITP is an intent to package

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
and that was a request by somebody

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
to say package this software for Debian

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
and Ubuntu. So

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
in the two weeks that have elapsed

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
since that ITP post

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
a snap has been created

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
it's in the snap

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
store for the appropriate

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
archives and the necessary support

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
to embed snaps in ISO

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
images has been added

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
to the build infrastructure and now

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
we're shipping a snap by default.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Which is an interesting story when you

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
think about what we've heard

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
about projects like Nextcloud and

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
you know software that's frozen

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
in archives and how that causes

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
maintenance issues for developers

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
and all the rest of it and that the time

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
that they have to wait before the next version

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
gets into the archive.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
So there's a very interesting story here

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
about a fast moving piece of software that

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
is now being deployed by default

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
in an ISO image and the

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
speed at which that's been done.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
And this implementation isn't

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
complete at the moment. So at the moment

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
it's kind of tightly

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
coupled with the live

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
build system

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
and what we're going to be doing is

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
exposing this in the usual way

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
that people that make

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Ubuntu flavors

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
are used to for what's called

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
seeding packages that go in their live

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
image. And I see on the

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Ubuntu

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
community hub the Ubuntu

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
budget team have replied and said you know they

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
were interested in doing this and they wanted

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
some more details about how this was done

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
because they have a number of snaps

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
that they would be interested in shipping by

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
default in Ubuntu budget.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
And what do you learn by

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
having something like this installed because it's

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
not just a matter of making it available to

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
install which I could do now but there

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
is got to be value in

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
a certain amount of user base

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
having this installed by default.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Yeah so there's a couple of things

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
there. Oh goodness.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
The first is

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
that you know the build infrastructure has

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
to be able to install this snap into

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
the ISO as it's being

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
constructed. And it's not just the snap

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
of course because the snap sits on top

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
of the core snap

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
as well. So the core snap

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
is being shipped by default

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
in Ubuntu Mate 17.10

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
now. Which normally what

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
happens is the first time you install a snap

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
the core snap gets installed

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
as well.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
So the core snap and this

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
snap are shipped by

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
default. And what we'll do is

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
sometime after the release

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
we'll push out an update

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
to PulseMixer

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
and we'll be able to make sure

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
that all of the backend infrastructure is

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
geared up appropriately to cope with

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
that demand for updating

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
all of those systems. So there's some backend

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
soak testing being conducted

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
as well. That makes a lot of sense.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
It was super critical that we choose

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
something nice and small that doesn't

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
have a super big impact on the

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
size of the ISO image but also

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
is a useful utility.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
We don't want to just throw shovelware on

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
the ISO. We wanted to put something on

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
there that's actually quite useful and

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
PulseMixer is actually a kind of

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
useful thing to like open a terminal type

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
PulseMixer and have a nice little

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
thing that you can use to adjust the levels

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
on your microphone and your speakers and your

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
headset and all that kind of stuff. It's actually a cool tool.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
So it fulfills

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
like all of the requirements for

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
putting something on the CD.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Think PAVU control but

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
for the console. I was just wanting

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
that. I think I'll be snap installing this later

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
today. We're making an official pic of the show today.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Go check it out. It's PulseMixer and

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
you can get it as a snap too. Which I guess would be

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
what? Snap search PulseMixer if you want to see the

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
entry? Snap install PulseMixer

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Snap Info PulseMixer. Both of those work.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
There you go. And then

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
if you look at like the screenshot here

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
on the Ubuntu community page

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
you can see that you can individually control

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
the volume of particular Chrome tabs too

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
which that's pretty cool.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
And then Mumble and individual applications.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Also you'll see that Wimpy has a

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Scarlett USB analog which

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I approve. I like that.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
I love that. It's great audio interface.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
That's what we're talking on

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
right now actually. We are talking on one of those.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
It's not the only one we have but that's the one

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
on this machine. Well fascinating.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
So I

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
suppose this is really early days

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
but my last question might be

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
what are your thoughts on sharing

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
what's discovered?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Well I think that that will

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
be some months from now before

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
we see enough users

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
installing Ubuntu Mate and having

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
this snap pre-registered on people's

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
machines and then we'll push an update

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
out. And what's interesting is

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
the plan for the update is to push out

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
a version of the snap that's actually smaller

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
than the snap that's being deployed

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
on the ISO image.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Do we talk much about that?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Do we talk much about that on the show?

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
That was another thing that kind of came up

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
at the Ubuntu rally that

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
was a rather impressive piece of

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
work.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
And I don't want to steal the thunder but it sounds like

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
there could be kind of a big change coming to the size

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
of snaps.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Yeah, I mean this was

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
I think actually if Daniel's here

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
it was actually one of the elementary

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
applications that saw the biggest

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
reduction in that whole exercise.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Oh snap!

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Tell me.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Well it was really interesting because we're

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
digging into the idea

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
of the platform snap, right?

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
And trying to make sure

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
that the size of the snaps

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
were comparable to

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
their deb package equivalents.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
And because we're kind of sticklers

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
about that kind of stuff and we kept poking

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
and going, can it get smaller? Can't it get

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
just a little bit smaller? And Ken

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
was just furiously typing

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
you know, okay maybe if we did this and

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
did that and we finally poked him

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
enough that he found a hidden

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
off by default option that just

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
drastically reduces the size of

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
snaps. Really?

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
The really cool thing was Ken found it

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
via the KDE developers

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
who were also there at the rally.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
It was actually one of the KDE

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
developers, Scarlett, who's been

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
going like a machine

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
snapping all the KDE

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
apps. There's loads of them been pushed in

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
the store. And she said, oh yeah you want

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
this option and this will make your snaps

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
much smaller. She passed that on to Ken

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
and then that little word of mouth

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
thing made all the snaps much smaller.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Not just the elementary ones but all the

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
known ones as well. It was great.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Yeah, significantly smaller.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
I think in the case of, was it

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
local that was being snapped at the time, Daniel?

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
No, we were actually just doing the calculator.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
We were trying to start simple.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I think it was something like

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
9 meg and then this change was made

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
and it was 136k.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
That's quite the diet.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
That is really good work.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
That's

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
something that should just make it across Mark's

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
desk at some point. Like if nothing else

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
we can take that away from the Ubuntu

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
rally, Mark. We got that.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
That's a good

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
point. Well, good work gentlemen.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Curious to see where this goes

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
and of course the timeline is rather

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
obvious I suppose because this is all an effort to collect

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
data for 1804 in a sense

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
to determine how far

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
you go. So I guess in

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
a sense you're going to have to kind of turn this thing

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
around in a few months really.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Yeah, I don't know what the

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
plans of the desktop team are but

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
you will have seen that

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Ken, as we just

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
discussed, Ken has been snapping a

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
number of the GNOME desktop

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
applications and other members of the

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
desktop team have been doing the same.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
It may well be that

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
some of those applications ship

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
as snaps in 1804

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
and you have an LTS with

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
rolling applications sitting

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
on top.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
And you know

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
the thing that's interesting

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
here is there's this popular

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
meme in the community

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
that snaps are only for IoT and

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
server and don't work for desktop

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
apps and Ken is totally

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
proving that wrong in

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
multiple ways like

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
the Snap Demon that runs

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
on 1804 next year

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
is the same Snap Demon that

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
runs on 1604 that was released

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
a year ago and that's the same

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Snap Demon that was

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
available for 1404 that

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
was three years ago.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
So he can put one

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
GNOME application, 3.26

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
GNOME application in the store

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
and that same Snap works

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
on 1804, 1604, and

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
1404. The exact same

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
application packaged once

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
runs on multiple LTSs

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
and non Ubuntu

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
systems as well. That is an

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
epic win. There you go.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
I guess we should

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
probably move forward but

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
I guess this is all really

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
you know I'm going to say this.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
What the bigger picture is

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
is that 1710 is now days

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
away and a lot

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
of this stuff is falling into place and that's really

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
the meta story around all

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
of this and

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I'm going to give a plug to the last two

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
episodes of Ask Noah. You got to

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
check those out if you are not a routine

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
listener of his show. First of all he's been

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
killing it recently and second of all

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
he has two interviews

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
that are split across to episode

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
29 and episode 28

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
and start with 28

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
and it's an interview

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
maybe Martin

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
or Poppy if you know the name of the developer

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
that Noah was interviewing but

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
It's Jerry Boland. Thank you.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
He had a great interview with Jerry and

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
it talks a lot about

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Canonical's thoughts around Wayland

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
and how to implement it correctly where

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Mir could still have a very

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
real role especially for smaller desktop

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
projects and what

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
the hell happens if 1710

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
ships Wayland by default and it blows up

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
in everybody's face. What happens

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
then? All of that is in episode

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
28 and then in episode 29

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
of the Ask Noah show and so

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
good additional background information

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
as we get really close to the 1710

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
release.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
I can hear you wanting to

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
wrap up this Ubuntu stuff.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
I know there's one more thing we want to get to so go ahead.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
There is yes. Yeah.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
It's all yours. You have the floor.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Well Poppy you've

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
been doing a lot of the local comments.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Poppy you have the floor.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
You have the floor Poppy.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
So as you mentioned

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Chris it's a few days away from the 1710

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
release and it turns

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
out that the Ubuntu project

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
kicks out a ton

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
of ISO images. It's not just Ubuntu

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
with Gnome. There's all

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
the flavors as well. There's that little

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
known one called Ubuntu Mate

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
and then there's all the other really big ones as

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
well. So Ubuntu, Lubuntu,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Ubuntu Studio.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
There's just tons and

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
we need

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
some help from our community

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
to help us test those and

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
we would really love it if people

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
could join us on Monday. We're having a

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
hangout on Monday.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
1500 UTC I think

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
it is where myself and Martin

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
are going to go through all you need to do

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
to download the ISO images get

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
these things booted up on a machine

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
and a USB stick test that

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
stuff out report bugs. Let us

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
know what's busted so that we can

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
get that stuff fixed. Now we're not saying you'll get fixed

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
for release which is next

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Thursday the 19th of October

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
but we'll certainly get stuff queued up

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
for immediately after release if

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
it's super critical. So yeah

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
join me and Martin. If you go

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
to Ubuntu On Air there's a nice

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
little YouTube video you can

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
you can watch next Monday

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
on the 16th of October at

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
1500 UTC. So that's

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
the URL to go to is ubuntuonair.com

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
next Monday.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Yep. You can go to

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
our community site community.ubuntu.com

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
and there's a pinned post there

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
as well and you'll find

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
a post about this. It's all about

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
just the easy way to get

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
a smooth transition into the Ubuntu community

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
helping people out and

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
getting stuff tested. If you got a little

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
bit of spare time it would be super appreciated.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Yeah. You know what I'll put a link in the show notes

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
because you might not out

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I don't always get a chance to file a bug

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
for every little thing. I don't get to test

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
every little bit but I can download

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
an ISO and give it a go and

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
that's something we can all do.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
And that's part of the problem

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
is you know people find it difficult to do

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
that. The process of finding

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
bugs is a little bit abrasive. We want to make that

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
easier and if it's difficult

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
you just tell us what the bug is. We'll reproduce

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
it. We'll file the bug right.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
We'll help you through that process.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
We want to make it easy. But what we need is

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
lots of different people to test this stuff on

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
diverse platforms

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
lots of different systems. Not just

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
the same ThinkPad that everyone in the

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
company has. How about I'll bring

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
my Macbook that I use for

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
video editing. How would you like that?

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Nobody wants that.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Although I do have a Librem 15 I could

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
bring to the party.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
I'll bring my System76 Lemur guys.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
There you go. That's good. Got to make sure that

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
works because there we go. That's three people.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Yeah.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
We've got this Librem 15 here in studio

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
that we've got to talk about.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
I've been using it

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
now for about three weeks

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
and I wasn't really quite sure

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
how to really do

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
this review until

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
I went to the Ubuntu rally and I brought this as my

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
daily driver for the rally. Then it all just sort of

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
clicked together. Now the timings worked

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
out really well with them nailing

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
their crowd funders. We're going to talk about

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
all of that. We've got to get to this thing. We've got to

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
discuss this. Although

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
we're running a little tight I'm hoping we'll still

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
have time to also talk about

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
episode 250 and beyond.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
But first

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
DigitalOcean. DigitalOcean.com

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Go over there and create your account

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
It's one word and you get a $10 credit.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Now you can do a lot with this $10 credit.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Traditionally I would say go spin up a

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
droplet. Go like the $5 a month rig.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Run it for two months for free. Go like a maniac.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Lots of distros, great

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
dashboard, data centers all over the world.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
But now

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
there's a whole new thing you could

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
use that $10 credit for.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Wes I've got to recommend

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
if you haven't had a chance yet you've got to

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
try out the new DigitalOcean spaces.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
It's

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
remarkable how straightforward

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
this is. It's simple

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
reliable object storage.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
And if you want to use it with their

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
crazy great simple API and

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
programmatically create storage

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
and transfer stuff

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
into it and then destroy the storage

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
you can do that.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
If you also just want to upload

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
some files through a nice web UI

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
generate a public URL that expires

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
after a couple of days and can be

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
downloaded X number of times and send it out

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
you can do that. And what's

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
really nice about that is DigitalOcean

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
has really

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
great bandwidth. Like their

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
hypervisors have 40 gigabit connections but the data

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
centers themselves are nuts.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
And that's where these files are hosted.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
You're getting the full blast

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
of the DigitalOcean data center when you share these

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
links. Right. You don't have to worry. It's not like you

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
put it on some tiny little server

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
and then oh whoops I shared

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
this to so many people.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
It's prepared for that. When you're using it to share

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
files super fast. When you're using it

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
for crazy back end object storage

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
it's intensely

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
fast. And they're giving a two

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
month trial right now. If you go over to

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
DigitalOcean.com you create your account

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
apply our promo code DOUNPLUGGED and you can try

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
out their new spaces system. Beyond that

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
though if you want to create a machine on their infrastructure

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
be it Ubuntu or Fedora or

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
FreeBSD or Debian they

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
have the best UI to do

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
this. They have a system that will

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
get you going in less than 55 seconds.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
And if you want to attach this traditional block

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
storage that just shows up as like a

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Dev SDA device or whatever they

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
have that too. You don't have to go

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
with the fancy new object storage

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
if that ain't how you roll. They have monitoring

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
alerting. They have load balancing as a service

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
and tons of pre-built open source applications ready

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
to go.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Just really all I have to say right there. There's really no

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
reason like just go sign up get that you know.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Ten dollars. You can

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
roll with that for quite a while especially with that three cents

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
an hour which is my favorite rig. Yeah

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
right. Like there's tons of times there's times where I have no

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
droplets going for a little while. You know I'm just not I don't have

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
any. I have some other things going.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
But in like less than a minute I just

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
open my browser bump on over there

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
several new servers. I did that last night.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
It's so helpful. Once you have everything set

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
up you've got your SSH keys in there.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
It just becomes part of your workflow.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Yeah it's a fun way to play with new open source

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
projects that you've been thinking around with or something you find

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
on GitHub. It's pretty cool.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
It's pretty cool.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
DigitalOcean.com use the promo code DO

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
unplugged all one word you apply to your account

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
after you get started. And a big thank you to

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
DigitalOcean for sponsoring the unplugged

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
program. So yeah let's start

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
this guys in Mumble Room. Please feel free

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
to jump in if

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
you have any questions as we go

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
along. Now

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
I want to start this review by talking about the

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
obvious elephant in the room.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
And that is the fact that Purism

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
reached their crowdfunding goal

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
for the Librem 5 which is

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
really kind of remarkable because it's a one point five

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
million dollar target. Yeah that's

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
impressive. Yeah. Yeah. And this as you

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
recall we've talked about this. This is the five inch

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
privacy focused smartphone

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
that they're building from the

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
ground up to use Matrix

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
for encrypted communications.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
They'll have a separate CPU from the baseband.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
They're going to have kill switches for the camera.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Hello.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Oh. We have somebody

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
at the door.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
We have the separate kill switches for Wi-Fi

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
and cellular connectivity

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
and things like that. And then of

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
course they're also going to not necessarily

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
prevent the possibility of connecting to an external

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
display or keyboard and mouse because the thing's running

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
basically Debian. It's pure OS

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
or whatever with

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
about three gigs of RAM if I

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
recall. Yeah 32 gigs of storage and

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
a courage jack aka the headphone port.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
And it's reached

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
its initial goal and now they're shooting

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
for the milestones I guess or

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
not the milestones but the what do you call it?

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
What are they called? Stretch goals.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Yeah.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Congratulations to them I suppose. Yeah that's good.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
And so if anybody in the mobile room has anything they want to

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
comment on that aspect of the story before we

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
continue feel free.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
I say congrats to them and I hope this thing

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
is a success. Just as a comparison like the

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
mobile room 15 they had a $250,000

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
goal they made twice that so

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
almost $600,000 but this

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
is a whole new scale of just projects.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Wow it really is. Yeah. Can you explain

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
to me what a multi-function port is

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
though? No.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Well do you ever wonder if one of your

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
ports just didn't do enough you know?

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
It only did the one thing?

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
I guess that just means USB-C.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
That's what I was thinking. I think the implication

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
is it's a mobile device so it's only going to have a limited

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
number of ports. You're not going to have like

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
tons of ports all around the edges of the device.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
You'll have one and everything will connect

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
to that maybe with a dongle or USB-C like

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
you say. Yeah.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
I've been following

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
this with some interest because what seems to have

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
really pushed it over the edge in the final

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
last couple of days

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
here was some

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
people got in at really

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
significantly high levels like I believe perhaps

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
the highest levels

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
which is quite remarkable because it

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
caused quite the trajectory

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
and

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
it was a bit weird actually.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
A little while ago, a few

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
days ago there were two people who

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
went in at the

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
$19,999 level and two people

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
who went in at the $17,999 level

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
within the same hour

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
and then again

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
this morning or earlier on today

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
the same thing happened.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Two more at $19,999 and two more

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
at $17,999. Now it

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
makes me think that when you add those

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
numbers up it's probably just

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
one person investing but the only way that they can

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
invest that significant chunk of money

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
is to split it between those two

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
and that totals up to the amount that they

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
want to invest. There's someone

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
who wants to invest in this thing and they're

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
giving that amount of money. That's

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
the only way it makes sense to me. There's no way

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
you'd get four people

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
within one hour

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
giving that amount of money.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Yeah and you've been following the chart

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
rather closely so I think you've got actually

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
a good visualization

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
of it

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
and that seems possible

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
and I suppose good for them.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
I think they're running the crowdfunding

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
site themselves so I don't know if they actually have

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
to disclose who these people are but I sure

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
would be interested.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
I don't know. As a privacy

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
focused device I can see them not doing it.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
I can see them not wanting to do that

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
and people who donate not wanting people

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
to know who they are and that's perfectly

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
reasonable.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Yeah and

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
I think it's sort of with this

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
as the background that I'm

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
looking now at the

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Alibrum 15 which is

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
their rather high end

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
laptop that's

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
fairly competitive. This one is black

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
it's all metal. It's

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
15.6 inch screen.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
It has a high end i7

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
processor in it. It has

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
very fast SSD drives. It has

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
a sixth generation or

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
seventh.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
If you get a chance over there give me a

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
give me a read on the graphics

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
because I think it's actually Intel 600

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
but

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
this was something that I didn't actually

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
order. I didn't actually buy this.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
This was something that Purism thought

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
would be appropriate to replace for me.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
So

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
it's 520. OK. Thank you.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
OK. So

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
I have the very first

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Alibrum 15 that they ever shipped that

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
was slightly below what they

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
had hoped to originally ship I think.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
And I

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
know that they kind of hummed hot about it

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
and they decided it was worth trying to make good on that.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
And I respect that. That's really nice of

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
them. And so I wasn't expecting

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
this when it arrived. I just thought OK

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
well this is really. So I came

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
at it with this sort of like

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
where does this fit. Right. Where does this

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
fit in my life. And

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
so I used it. You know I did the standard

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
things like you know tried to push it to see how

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
loud it could get and tried to

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
push the battery and

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
loaded Soulless and now it's going

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
loaded Gentoo and yeah

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
loaded Ubuntu and yeah now it's

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
undergoing the beard test. And it was

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
it wasn't until the trip to

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
New York came up. Is that

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
right. And I went OK

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
because the

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
the physical kill switches

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
all of a sudden became

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
a much more practical

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
option because

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
I'm going into an area

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
that I don't normally go into.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
And

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
why not just turn off the Wi-Fi like why not

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
have that extra level of security. Now

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
ironically iPhone 7 users

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
did experience issues with Wi-Fi in

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
New York so that Wi-Fi attacks

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
were actually a problem in that very hotel.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Now it wasn't one for this but

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
I actually kind of I found a

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
practical purpose and I will say this to

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
their they are they are implemented in a cleaner

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
less obvious

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
way than the old

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Librem 15. Is that right. So it's interesting. So we have it

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
right here the old Librem 15 and they're

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
like basically there's holes in the aluminum

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
casing and then there is a

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
old school electronic black toggle switch

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
that sticks out of the aluminum.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Yeah. Now with this one it's like

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
a nice etched

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
plastic switch and

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
the hole is sort of cut to the size that

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
it needs to be for that switch.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Beard you have it right now. Do you agree with that.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Yeah. And they put it in.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Weren't they on the side before. Yeah. Well they

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
stood out more because they were in a more obvious spot.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Yeah. Now they've put it more

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
like close to the screen.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
And it has a matte display. I'm not

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I'm not blown away by the display to be

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
honest with you. The viewing angles are a little rough from

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
time. But if you're sitting if you're looking right

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
at it it's a pretty great display. And the fact that it's

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
non reflective is a nice

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
change of pace. I'd say it's at least comparable

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
or better than Lenovo displays.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Really. You like it. So you like it.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Yeah. Well I don't like Lenovo

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
displays. So now

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
the one thing so there's there's one thing that

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
they're doing differently with the trackpad that I'm having

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
a hard time adding

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
a description

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
to. It's a

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
decently sized trackpad

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
and it's it doesn't have like an obvious

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
right or left side. It's just one big

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
trackpad and it has some

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
multi-touch support including like two finger

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
scrolling and things like that. But it's

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
it's texturized.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
It's texturized in a way that I like though

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
in a

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
in sort of a

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
in a way that gives me

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
sort of tactile feedback of where

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
I'm at on the trackpad like how much distance

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
my finger has traveled. But not

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
in a way that feels like I'm going

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
against gunk on the trackpad. Like it doesn't

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
it doesn't cause friction.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
I disagree. Yeah I thought you might

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
because to me it does feel very frictiony

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
and I don't like it at all.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Yeah I thought you might. I'm a little more

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
I'm coming more from the MacBook trackpad which is

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
like slippery glass and I'm just

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
like that's the other extreme and I'm like

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
I think I like a little more traction right now.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Yeah I've definitely had like I don't mind

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
the amount of friction on this one.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
It was pleasant enough. It's still

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
smooth. I could move as fast as I wanted

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
to. I've definitely encountered some trackpads where

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
it feels like you're just dragging your finger

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
across I don't know solid

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
sandpaper. Another thing that I've noticed with the trackpad

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
is if you drag your finger

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
from the bottom like where the invisible

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
buttons are

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
it won't move the mouse

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
and I haven't run into that with other

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
trackpads.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
So that's a button only

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
area. Yeah. One of the things I like is it does

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
have hardware physical toggle right there

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
you can do FN and toggle the mouse button off

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
so you don't have to worry about like accidental

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
when you're doing a lot of typing. Speaking of

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
typing

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
I'm all over the map on this keyboard.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
I think

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
when I put the laptop down and pick it

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
back up I'd like it a lot because

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
I've been experiencing RSI recently

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
and so this is one of those laptops where

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
my fingers aren't being slammed into

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
like a shallow keyboard hole

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
there's there's travel

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
and there's some good give to it

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
and I like that

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
aspect of it but my hands don't seem to quite

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
line up. Yeah.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
I think this keyboard

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
would be perfect if they

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
didn't include the number pad.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
It's funny you say that because I've been really enjoying

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
having that number pad. Yeah I feel

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
like you could if you really wanted a number pad

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
that you could just get an external one and plug it in.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Yeah I suppose so.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
The way the keyboard is it feels cramped

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
and too off center so my

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
fingers are always on the wrong keys. Yeah I notice

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
it the most when I'm typing like a complicated password.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Or when you're

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
going through the Google doc for the show.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Ah yeah.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
But what do you think of the feel of the keyboard

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
like if you're sitting down there because that particular

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
problem if I'm typing a lot in a day

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
I can I can generally reset

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
and I can I can adapt.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
I like the feel of the keyboard.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
I feel like the

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
I guess the base that's underneath it

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
tends to

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
send vibrations a bit too much.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Makes the whole laptop

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
vibrate and it bugs me a little

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
bit. So those are sort

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
of the unique things that I feel like they've

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
brought. And the reason why I wanted

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
to talk about these things is because

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
all of this feels different than a Clevo.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
It doesn't doesn't. I don't.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
This is this must not be a Clevo because this

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
it doesn't feel like a Clevo at all. It feels like

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
a custom built laptop

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
and that's something that generally only

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
get an impression of when I'm holding like an XPX

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
or a ThinkPad in my hands.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
This feels like it

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
was built for this

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
purpose and it feels like it's a

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
unique piece of equipment. It actually

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
feels a lot like the razor

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
blade laptops which

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
I like. Yeah it does.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
And they have a they have a purism

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
key on the super key there. So that's

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
the aesthetics. And it's I've

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
mentioned it's a it's a it's like an aluminum all

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
black. And

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
now the performance

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
has been pretty great.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
I've been trying to get

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
fan issues to crop up because that's

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
what I had original problems with

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
and been quite happy with. Really.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
The acoustics have been quite. I mean I guess if you

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
took it to New York you used it. Yeah.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
And you know in almost

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
all cases I'd say

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
battery life was pretty

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
pretty pretty average. Were you using

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
any like power top or

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
you know I don't I wasn't I was

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
just sort of going with do. Can I get my

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
work done in the day. Yeah. And I was probably

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
doing three and a half four hours worth of work and

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
the battery was I just plugged in every single

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
night and the battery lasted every day for me just fine.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
I'm going to I'm going to run a GPU benchmark and see

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
if it gets on the fans. Yeah do it. Yeah go

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
ahead because that is an interesting area to play with.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
So you have you have something

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
that is

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
notably better than

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
the first model that I got in

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
every single way. Obvious

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
ways like the better CPUs

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
the better graphics the faster

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
SSDs the superior screen

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
all of those ways. But

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
in some of the ways that are truly

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
purism to like the way

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
the toggle switches are implemented or

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
the obvious

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
obvious care that went into

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
the keyboard that

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
feels uniquely purism

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
and that actually does

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
give me a lot of hope for

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
the Librem 5.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
If anybody has ever owned a TiVo

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
you know

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
that the engineers of the TiVo

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
must have spent the majority of their time

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
developing the TiVo remote

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
because that's truly the most innovative

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
aspect of the TiVo was

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
the perfect peanut remote.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
And you

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
and nobody's ever beat the TiVo remote.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Nobody has ever created a better remote

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
than the TiVo remote.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And it feels like that's where purism is going with the

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
keyboard. They're not there yet

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
but when you sit down and use it it feels

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
like something unique

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
to them. It doesn't feel like a ThinkBad

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
or a MacBook

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
and I don't think they're quite there yet

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
but you can tell a lot of thought and care

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
went into that. And when

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
you're looking at a lot of vendors out there a lot

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
of whom I respect who are selling

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
a repackaged Clevos in a way that

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
some of those things are sort of standard across

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
all of the models. It's really nice

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
to see some differentiation here. I don't

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
know where they're sourcing it from exactly so don't

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
quote me on all of that but it generally

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
somebody who has played with a lot of laptops

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
it's nice to see a unique trackpad

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
implementation and a unique keyboard

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
implementation with

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
what feels like their own hinge to

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
on the laptop screen. And then

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
the performance is as you would expect with

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
any of this generation of Intel and

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
and you know SSDs.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
It's like yeah it may not be perfect. It may not

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
be where we want it to end up but

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
it feels like there's been care and

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
concern and design choices

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
made. I opted not to use PureOS

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
so they shipped it to

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
me with no OS installed.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
And I've tried

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Solus. I've tried Gentoo and I've

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
tried Ubuntu 17.10

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
proper which is what's on there

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
right now. And Beard I

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
kind of wanted to get your thoughts about that too

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
because

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
it's like a really great

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Ubuntu machine isn't it? Like it's just the new

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
release and the black casing and

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
the nice screen and the colors with the

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
all black system. Like it all just

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
goes really well together don't you think?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
And it says something about like

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I didn't even realize that this was Gnome

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
or Ubuntu 17.10

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
until you told me because

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
it looked just like a Unity

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
desktop. Yeah it does look

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
a lot like Unity 7 too. Yeah that as

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
well. So the Librem

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
15 is actually

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
a contender. I really think it

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
is. I don't know for myself

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
if I would buy one today because what

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I need from a system like this today

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
is Thunderbolt 3 support

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
in that USB-C port.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
And I'd like charging and I'd like external

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
GPU because what I want to start doing

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
is I want to start switching over to laptops

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
that have Intel graphics built in

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
with external GPU support so I can buy

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
one GPU maybe once a year

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
and then I can switch it between

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
my systems. I

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
was not able to get this to work

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
with my external Thunderbolt 3 dock

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
at all for power or for

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
any devices external display or anything like that.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
That would be something for me

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
that I would really really want.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Now however because now that I have this

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
obviously I'm going to be

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
using it for things so

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I'm now going to just make this my

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Ubuntu 17.10 system for a while

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
and it'll be my daily driver at home

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
running Ubuntu 17.10. Nice.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And yeah I think it's going to make

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
a great home workstation for me. See for me

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I think long term I probably would

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
not like this. Mostly

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
because it doesn't have a dedicated GPU

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
built in. Yeah if you could see

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
that's why I was thinking like here at work I'm going to want a dedicated

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
GPU. So if you could hook up an external

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
eGPU. Yeah but

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
for someone like me I don't want to

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
spend an extra five or six hundred dollars

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
on an external GPU enclosure that I'm only

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
going to use with one system. Oh yeah

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
I would use it across a couple systems yeah.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Wimpy sold me on that pretty heavily.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Definitely.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
But yeah

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
good build. I would not

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
be ashamed to take it into a coffee shop

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
or conference. No

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
it looks good and it's clean and

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
there's no obvious branding on the top.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Yeah kind of like that. On the bottom there's

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
like a Purism logo but it's just white on black

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
it's nice and clean. I feel like this is actually

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
a laptop if you took it to

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
like a coffee shop or something people would ask you what it is.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Yeah.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
It's that good

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
polish wise. Yeah and I've got

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
I've got I picked up at Segal

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
I picked up an all white

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
circular gnome logo.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And it would look really good in the center of that

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
laptop. But of course I

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
may not end up writing gnomes out.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
But yeah you're right. Everyone has to know. You just have to have it

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
installed you know. I feel like we need to do a

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
hardware hack where we just put a glowing

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
gnome foot on the back of the laptop.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
The next things I would

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
yeah that'd be cool. The next things I'd really like to see from

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
laptops like this is no power

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
dongle needed. No separate power brick

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
and dongle. I'd like to see everything

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
being only powered off USB-C. That's an important one

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
for me. It really simplifies things so we can get there.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I gotta say man when I was editing

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
off of a car charger of cigarette

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
adapter in a car off of USB-C

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I was like this is really useful.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
And this laptop couldn't do that and

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
it made it not as usable in the car. And that's just

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
a small thing. It's only really applicable to me.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Hashtag Chris problems. And then

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
the other thing I'd really really really

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
love to start seeing

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
is I'd love to see some other manufacturer

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
besides Lenovo integrate

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
LTE modems or some sort of

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
cellular connectivity into these

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
sons of bitches. Right but not like not in a

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
you can add it if you open it up and add

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
but you know like a just like I can check it on the website.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
I just add a SIM. I add a SIM card when I

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
get it and I can get connectivity because

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I would love that. I would pick it all the time.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Having always

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
on connectivity is such

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
an important aspect to anybody

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
that would be getting a machine

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
like this that we're all

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
either jumping on insecure Wi-Fi

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
or we're tethering our devices

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
in some cockamamie fashion or

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
we're stopping by Starbucks constantly

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
and getting on the free Google Wi-Fi and they monitor everything

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
we do like there's no great option.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
And one of the things that drives me crazy about

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Noah is him and his

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
fancy ass Lenovo where the son of a gun

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
has two batteries and an LTE

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
modem and it all works under the

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
same screen. I'm like I want to buy

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
from a vendor who only builds Linux

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
systems but has those things.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
So they're working on

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
the keyboard. They're working on the trackpad. They're

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
working on the matte display and

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
they've really nailed the 15.6 inch

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
you know system here.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
If the next generation

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
could have USB-C charging and

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Thunderbolt 3 and some sort

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
of cellular connectivity with another

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
hardware switch which is there with something

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
they're great at. I would be

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
all over that.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
You're making me drool Chris. That would be a great system.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
By the meantime if you don't need

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
those things this

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
system nails it. I was really impressed

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
and what's your battery at right now

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
because we've been off battery I don't know for

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
at least two hours. We still have another

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
four hours of battery left. Yeah okay there

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
you go. Is that 67 percent? Okay

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
so that's after about two hours of and you messing around

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
on the system checking it out not probably doing

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
benchmarks. Oh you are running some benchmarks.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Well it's not bad

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
and no fans yet.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
No. Yeah that's really a thing about this one.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
When I was running the GPU benchmark I very

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
slightly heard the fan. Yeah every now and then just a little bit

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
but I'm pretty particular

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
about that and I had it on

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
my desk which is a glass desk so it just

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
amplifies laptop fan noise

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
and really no complaints.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
And in fact you know what

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I had some benchmarks running on it when the room

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
was way hotter than it should have been because

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I didn't leave my window open I left my door

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
closed and I got in there it was like 85 degrees

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
in American imperial degrees

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
and I got in there and it was

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
it was

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
ridiculously hot and that laptop

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
was chugging away and the fan noise was

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
still pretty respectable it was just like a little

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
just a little background noise.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Damn. Wow. Just past the hot

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
box test. Yeah.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
So I'm impressed and so I'm going

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
to be packaging up my old one

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
my old Librem 15

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
and they're going to they're going to they're going to take it

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
and probably put it under some sort of like

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
quarantine or something I would imagine.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Maybe an honorary sacrifice. Yeah.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Viking funeral. Yeah. And melt it down and

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
use its parts for the Librem 5. Yep yep.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
There we go. From the ashes. Recycling.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Alright

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
well Mumble Room you guys have been pretty quiet during

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
our review do you have any questions

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
about this here

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
hardware and about the Librem 15 before

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
we move on or any thoughts too if you have

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
about the Librem 5 feel free.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Yes I do. Go ahead.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
So I was wondering about

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I'm sorry about

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
the kill switches.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
So if you

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
really have the laptop

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
by your side

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
are the kill switches soft or hard

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
and what can we expect if

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
they just

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
maybe break or stop

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
working. Well I

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
would I guess that have to be a warranty problem.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
So there they are hard

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
plastic slide switches

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
that slide to the

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
they come shipped in the on position and

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
you just pop them over to the off position

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
sort of like similar to like a mute switch

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
on a smartphone. It's basically a physical disconnect

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
I believe. Yeah it is. Yeah that's how they do

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
it. So it just disappears

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
to the operating system.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Oh that's OK. Thank you.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Yeah I think that's kind of nice

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
actually and that's why I think they'd be

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
one of the best vendors to ship a LTE

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
motor because boy isn't that something I'd love to just leave

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
switched off completely. Yes exactly. No

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
doubts about it. No doubts about

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
spying. No doubts about accidental data usage.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
No doubts about it. Just flip that switch

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
off and then when I need mobile Internet I flip

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
it on. I think that I think they'd nail

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
it. Of course they'd probably say buy a

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Liebman 5. Oh no.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
All right. Anybody else.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
I'm good Chris. I don't really have

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
anything on top of my head.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Yeah. And yeah. Well there

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
you go. Beardsley you have any closing thoughts Beardsley

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
on that before we move on. I just saw something I'm using

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
the

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
USB hubs that are inside

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
the laptop. Apparently the vendor is listed

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
as the Linux Foundation.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Really. Yeah.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
I don't know why. I bet

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
you we could find out. I bet you there's a good

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
I bet you there's a good story behind that. Yeah maybe.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
All right. So

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
do you think we could take a little time to talk about

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
the show or do you think we should wrap it up.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Anything. We can talk about

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
it. I mean.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
All right. So this is a wild west plus we started

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
a little late. So I'm just excited

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
that Dan's here from elementary. I know.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
That's really cool. It's great to have you here Dan.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
It's great to be here.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
So Dan

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
was just featured was it last week in the

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
show. So check out interview with Dan

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
that we just had last week.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
All right. So 218

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
right now and

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I was you know we've recently had a lot of

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
changes.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
With the end of Lass

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
and there's changes in the

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
works in JB already

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
that you don't know about.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
And so I wasn't really going to make any big

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
changes here on this

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
show because I felt like you know

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
we'll just stay here. We'll be set

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
a rock of the network. Right. Exactly.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Exactly. But

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
in such then I began to wear

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
weary worry weird worry

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
about perhaps some stagnation.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
And so I thought OK well

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
let's let's make changes by episode 300.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
And I thought

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
about you know these things are actually pretty good.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
None of them are really a bad thing. So we should make these changes

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
sooner. And so I think we're going to slowly start working

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
towards some stuff with episode 250.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
So you're going to take a moment

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
talk about the show.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Which we don't do very often. And

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
all of this is subject to change as well.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Yeah.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Because things change right. Preliminary and

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
meta and you know. Yeah.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Yeah. Speaking of things changing maybe

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
it's time for you to change Linux Academy

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
dot com slash unplug. That's where you

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
go to learn more about Linux and all of the critical

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
technology and the stacks of

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
technology around. You got to call it a stack.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
That's what we get to call it a stack now.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Out of all of the terms we use

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
stack is one of them we're going to take. Linux

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Academy is a full featured training library

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
with everything you need to know to learn new skills

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
and advance your career in Linux.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
They have hands on scenario based labs

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
that give you experience on real servers

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
and they have self paced in-depth

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
video courses which means when you

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
have time you can get the work done.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
They have course schedulers so you can pick

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
a time frame and stick to it with certain

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
learning goals and they have human beings that can

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
help you when you get stuck and they have learning

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
passes which are a series of courses and contents

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
planned by instructors for specific

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
career tasks and they have practice

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
exams which you can take before you actually

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
go take the big test which probably would

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
have been maybe one of the number one features

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I was probably I mean

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
maybe that maybe that and

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
maybe the hands on labs for me would have been the two

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
features when I was trying to get my certs that I could have used

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
a lot more of as I couldn't

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
imagine having Linux Academy back in the day

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
when I was working in IT.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
I mean I use it now just to dabble and one of the things

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
I love about it is you get like hour estimations

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
of how long learning something is going to take

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
and you get course where you can download with you

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
and listen to offline like those are things that

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
today I can appreciate but

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
oh man when I was when I was playing

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
that race of making sure I can get the certifications

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
so that way I can either get improvements on

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
the review or I can get that client

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I always got to taking the test

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
and would sort of jam up there

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
and if I could have taken more practice

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
exams or I could have taken courses that were

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
created specifically to prepare you for

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
the certification exams that

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
would have been a fundamental enabler for me.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Well and they're like you know you don't

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
have to bootstrap yourself so especially if you're

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
new to this can be pretty hard like okay well go set

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
up your own test server at home figure out how to

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
do that with Linux Academy like no just

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
they'll get you right in the environment you need to learn

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
whatever it is that you're actually working on

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
and then after like once you've figured it out

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
you just play with it so you can you know keep

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
doing it do it again go advanced

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
on it it's all right there and if you

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
get stuck human beings are there to help

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
and they're always adding new content

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
and retroactively adding and

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
proving the old content as well so

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
to sign up for a free seven day trial and support

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
the show linuxacademy.com slash

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
unplugged and a big thank you to

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
program so it is time for us to take

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
bold action Wes bold

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
action is required upon

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
us here for the unplugged program turns out

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
change is a way of life

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
we're making it into a show about hot sauce

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
well we are pivoting to a cooking show

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
no

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
well although sometimes

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
we joke we one day we would just

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
launch a cooking show just to get out of our system

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
it feels like it's inevitable like it's

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
gonna happen the beard and I joke about it

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
all the time so okay

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
let's talk about I consider them upgrades

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
so let's talk about why the changes

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
so right now Linux Unplugged

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
is Jupiter Broadcasting's largest

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
podcast which is funny because I don't

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
think of it as that because I'm so used to

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
having last be the largest podcast it's true

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
though so that means it's probably

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
up there in terms of largest

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Linux podcast I don't know if I can't claim it's the

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
largest although I think if you count video downloads

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
it's got to be up there but who knows anymore

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
last was so

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
huge that it just seemed easy to say yeah

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
that's obvious now with love it's like I'm

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
slugging it out and

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
we don't want to stand still basically

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
like I said I was gonna wait till 300

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
but I can't hold back

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
yeah that's what it's a waste

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
so what are the changes

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
here's what I'm thinking now none of this

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
is set in stone all of this is

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
subject to change and it's gonna

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
depend on if we can make it happen

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
obviously

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
but I think to keep

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Unplugged competitive and to keep people

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
enjoying the show

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
we're gonna go to a full video

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
show that's better produced than

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
last ever was and we're gonna do that

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
by making Unplugged an audio only

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
show

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
you following me

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
we're gonna go we're gonna become a video

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
show that was better produced than

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Linux action show ever was

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
and we're gonna do that by

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
becoming an audio show

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
an audio only show

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
that's more edited

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
it's closer to Linux action news as polish

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
but with the chill vibe

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
of Linux Unplugged and still live

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
while being a full video show

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
so that's what we're gonna do

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
is this before or after we've invented that

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
time travel

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
so what we're gonna do is

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
we're going to buy about a thousand dollars

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
or more in camera equipment if we can get the support

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
you know so we'll have a camera for me

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
a camera for you a camera for a guest

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
eventually if the beard ever goes on

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
camera we'll have a camera for him

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
and my intention is

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
what I'm thinking is we'll release a full unedited

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
video version behind the scenes

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
sort of like if you're gonna watch

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
like the Howard Stern show behind I don't know that's probably

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
a bad example but I'm trying to think of some radio

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
what are you setting us up for here?

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
you and I will be on camera and we'll

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
make that feed available to the patrons

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
because we have the whole pipeline to do that

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
we just have to add a couple of camera

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
pieces of equipment and boom boom boom done

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
and we've got the switcher we've got the

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
production pipeline we've got the publishing platform

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
we've got the download CDN everything

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
we need to do that is in place

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
but the thing I always hated about the Linux

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
action show was we had a camera

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
straight on and it was two people

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
sitting in front of a table

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
and not facing each other looking at a camera

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
with studio lights on and it just creates

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
a phony environment

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
and the green screen didn't help and

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
this would be you and I still sitting here

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
across the table looking at each other in the eye

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
doing this show

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
lights off relaxed but people

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
could just be here with us and

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
when you're talking the camera would be on you when I'm talking

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
camera on me etc. Are we gonna have to

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
put pants on for this?

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
No. This is for patrons.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Oh right. So then what we'll do with the wider

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
audience we'll get a better sounding more polished

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
product so we'll do multi track recording

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
of some capacity I'm not there yet we may

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
make changes in how we produce the virtual

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
lug so we can improve the audio

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
quality there.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
And that

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
will be a show and we'll make small

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
edits to that so that way like if there's

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
some weird erroneous loud noise

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
or a click or a clack or

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
too much talking over each other we'll clean

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
some of that up.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And publish that as

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
the standard show

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
with well produced audio levels

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
slightly tighter and cleaner production

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
but not dramatically changed which

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
would be the main show. And then if you want the

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
behind the scenes version we'll have that completely

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
unedited version that we have now.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
It'll be like you're just right here in the studio with us.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
And I think and so don't

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
don't jump to conclusions about

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
will the show change or anything like that because I think

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
if all of this is implemented right

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
all the things we like about the show will just be better

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
and it won't be like

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
this radical change to the show. In fact

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I could have gotten away without saying anything potentially

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
but the wider audience should get a better

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
sounding more polished product that's

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
more competitive I think.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
And is easier to listen

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
to. And the video version will have

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
better production than the Linux action show ever had

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
for those that really want it that still miss last.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
And the hardware investment would be our

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
initial upfront cost but then after that we'd be just

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
utilizing our existing production pipeline we're already

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
pumped for so

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
it's a pretty straightforward process

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
for JB to implement. And I think it would make

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
for a good show all around because those that want

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
a really great audio show will get it and people

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
that want to laid back

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
sort of low key video show will get that too.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
A lot of flexibility. And we'll

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
make some changes in how we record the

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
individual microphones and mumble to make this

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
all happen.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
But all of it will be for the better.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
So that's we're working towards that towards 250 now.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
I think what we're going to do

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
and we haven't made the official changes yet but I think

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
what we're going to do is we're going to set a milestone

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
on our Patreon page at patreon.com

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
slash Jupiter signal for forty

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
five hundred dollars.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
We have to change some of the milestone stuff right now.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
And we're going to work

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
towards that because we're going to make the initial

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
purchase for

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
the cameras but then also

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
we're going to either hire somebody

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
or I'm going to or some

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
somebody is going to be editing

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
the audio version of the show.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
So that way it's a fully fledged

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
well produced supported product.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
And so we're also going to be trying to raise

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
funds to make that happen. And so that's

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
why we're hoping that if people like this

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
idea or just want to help

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
us improve the production quality of the show they

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
consider becoming a patron at patreon.com slash

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Jupiter signal and then once you become one

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
later on once the video version is published

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
you would get access to that.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Which is really not too far

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
away. It just takes time and cameras.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Yeah. All of which we

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
can figure out but just

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
going to take some financing. And

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I know that all sounds like a lot

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
but if you think about all the pieces we have

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
in place it's actually all quite doable

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
because the video can be produced

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
on OBS. Yeah we have that.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
And that's that's running all the time.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
The audio can be recorded on a separate machine

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
on a multi-track recorder

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
that spits out FLAC files

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
or WAV files or whatever

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
that goes off to

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Rekai or a dedicated audio editor or

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
myself that then

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
runs the production on that and publishes

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
that as an MP3 and AUG or Web

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
M or whatever crazy ass format people want.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Right. And that's that nothing really

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
changes there. And

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
the video version is already done because it's

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
unedited. Yeah it's just a live OBS

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
creates the file and then we upload

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
that to Scale Engine we publish to the patrons

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
and we're done. And

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
we don't walk this weird awkward

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
line anymore.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
It just takes us changing some hardware

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
or actually adding some hardware

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
and adding some staffing.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Yeah. Contract staffing likely.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
So it seems doable. So we're just

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
we're going to we're going to we're going to try to get

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
to a new milestone on Patreon

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
to get there and I'm going to say I'm hoping we get there

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
by 250.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
We'll see. What do you guys think? Am I crazy?

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Everybody's good to me. No I like that idea.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
I mean. Sounds good. Video

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
can be fun. I like the like

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
live unplugged aspect and it's I mean

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
like we're hanging out here. It's a lot of fun. I think it would be fun to

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
to kind of share that more.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
And also I've been loving land

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
so there's certainly times

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
I would. And you've been on the other end of the actual production

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
aspect of land which that means there's

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
some there's other things there that we gain

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
that are sort of like inside baseball but

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
great from a production standpoint.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Which would be nice. Yeah.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
So here's my question.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Yes. You're going to be doing a nice

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
audio focus show when you can

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
upgrade me to an RE20. I know.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Maybe we'll do that when we get to the milestone as well.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Upgrade that microphone. Get you off the old stuff.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Yeah. That's people don't know

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
because we don't have cameras in here. But Rekai's on this weird

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
old mic that we used to use that

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
we no longer use. But then when we set up two more

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
additional chairs in the studio we had to pull out the old stuff.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
I missed the sexy bassiness

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
of my voice. Yeah.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
When you do use here you sit on a different mic so it sounds like a

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
different Rekai.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Well yeah. Then we'll work on that too.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
We'll work on that. All right.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
So if you have any thoughts

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
I'd like to hear them. So go over to the usual

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
places like jupiterbroadcasting.com

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
slash contact or

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
you can go to linuxunplug.reddit.com

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
or if you're a patron

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I'd really like to hear your thoughts at patreon.com slash

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
jupiter signal.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
And before we go I want to give

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
a plug to Mr. Popey's

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Ubuntu podcast. Go check that out.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Always a great listen.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
See what I'm listening. Hold on. Let me promote my

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
player right now. I'm listening to

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
season 10 episode 31

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
right now. So I just

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
that's how I love the show. And you know what

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
after seeing those guys

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
after seeing those guys in New York

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I realized I missed hanging out with them when I got back to

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Washington. That's so sweet.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
So you want to hear my solution. It's not it's not it's

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
not bulletproof but it's there it's getting there.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
You ready. Hey Siri.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
What are beans.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
A common name for large seeds

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
of several genera of the flowering plant family

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
of several genera of the flowering plant family

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
for bacilli also known as leguminosi

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
which are used for human or animal

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
food. I've changed my

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Siri voice to be quote unquote

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
British.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
And now it's now I think you

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
guys when Siri talks to me which is weird

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
in a lot of ways when I think about it.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
I think about it. Yeah. So check out the Ubuntu podcast

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
and of course Ubuntu

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
on air dot com on

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Monday 1500 UTC

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
for the ISO testing seems like

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
a good cause seems like a very good

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
cause. All right.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Absolutely. Thank you for being here. I think that's going to

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
bring us to the end of this week. So is there anything else we want to cover.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
I was going to try to fit in the Gentoo review this week

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
but I think we've kind of run out of time.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
So I guess we should probably punt that

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
till next week. And you know who saw that

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
coming. I didn't know. We don't want to distract

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
people should be thinking about the show the future getting

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
excited for it. So that's a perfect note to

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
well and you know the Libra 15 reviews really the meat

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
of the show. That was the focus this week. So I hate

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
to talk about Gentoo and it hasn't been the primary

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
focus. So I

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
guess for this week we're going to punt it. I didn't

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
see it coming. Didn't see it. I apologize.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I'm sure we'll get to it soon

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
though. I'm sure that's coming up very soon maybe 2 19

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
in the meantime. Thank you very much for being

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
cool. Well Chris I just

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
finished setting up no nice

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000

maybe I'm getting covers on this

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
son of a compass fusion.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Oh yeah. There we go. That's yeah I'm going to
