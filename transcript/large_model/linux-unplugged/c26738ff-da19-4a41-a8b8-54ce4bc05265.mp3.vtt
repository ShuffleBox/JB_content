WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Now, Wes, I know that you, maybe not home automation, so to speak, but you have found

00:06.000 --> 00:11.880
a way to do a lot of little things with free and open source technology, right?

00:11.880 --> 00:14.040
Like the open source Plex alternative.

00:14.040 --> 00:19.520
Are you familiar with anything that you might not think off the bat could be home automation,

00:19.520 --> 00:21.640
but in fact could be?

00:21.640 --> 00:22.640
What do you mean?

00:22.640 --> 00:23.640
Say that again.

00:23.640 --> 00:29.240
So I think a lot of people wouldn't necessarily consider Plex to be part of a home automation

00:29.240 --> 00:33.640
thing, but I would because it goes into the home theater, goes into the living room, goes

00:33.640 --> 00:38.880
into the master bedroom, wherever, and then provides essentially automated media, right?

00:38.880 --> 00:40.520
I can access my media on demand.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.200
I would consider that part of my automation system.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.000
I'm wondering if you know of any other, if you have any other suggestions or any other

00:45.000 --> 00:49.740
ideas or anything else that you've tried like that, that one could use to free and open

00:49.740 --> 00:51.920
source-ally automate one's home.

00:51.920 --> 00:52.920
Yeah.

00:52.920 --> 00:58.000
Well, one I was just looking at is a, I know many people frown on it, but frequently I'm

00:58.000 --> 00:59.920
faced with routers that use UPnP.

00:59.920 --> 01:00.920
Yes.

01:00.920 --> 01:05.000
And, you know, some applications are UPnP aware and they will automatically forward

01:05.000 --> 01:07.560
the ports, but some are not.

01:07.560 --> 01:11.120
And sometimes, you know, maybe you're visiting a family member or who may not even know the

01:11.120 --> 01:12.440
admin password to their router.

01:12.440 --> 01:16.080
You're in a situation where you don't have the freedom to open ports willy-nilly as you

01:16.080 --> 01:17.080
see fit.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.080
Right.

01:18.080 --> 01:22.640
And for that, I found a nice little UPnP-C, it's called, or UPnP-D that have a daemon

01:22.640 --> 01:28.440
and a client, and it lets you to interact with any UPnP-compliant router to specify

01:28.440 --> 01:32.280
ports to forward or delete port forwards as you want, so you can customize it for whatever

01:32.280 --> 01:34.020
application you're using.

01:34.020 --> 01:35.020
That's awesome.

01:35.020 --> 01:39.680
See, I do, as a network security guy, I do have some reservations about using UPnP.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.400
You know, and I do as well.

01:41.400 --> 01:45.140
But sometimes you're on a network where it's already enabled and you just have to work

01:45.140 --> 01:46.140
with it.

01:46.140 --> 01:47.140
You know, if you're...

01:47.140 --> 01:48.140
Yeah.

01:48.140 --> 01:49.140
So, I found it useful there.

01:49.140 --> 01:50.140
I personally don't use it at home, but...

01:50.140 --> 01:51.640
And it sure is convenient, isn't it?

01:51.640 --> 01:52.640
Oh, yeah.

01:52.640 --> 01:53.640
It's awesome.

01:53.640 --> 01:57.960
You know, and they also have, they have like the project that's doing it, they have a user

01:57.960 --> 02:03.240
space implementation, a lot of the BSD, TCP, IP stack, and so they also use that to provide

02:03.240 --> 02:04.240
the daemon.

02:04.240 --> 02:08.080
So, if you did want to use UPnP and you didn't have a device that used it, you can use their

02:08.080 --> 02:12.100
daemon protocol to run it yourself if you'd like to have it stick it on your PFSense box

02:12.100 --> 02:14.480
or anything else.

02:14.480 --> 02:17.040
Why you would do that, I don't know, but you can.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.800
That's the beauty of free and open source.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.880
Why did you say that you think that some people frown on it?

02:21.880 --> 02:23.600
Is it just the UPnP aspect?

02:23.600 --> 02:24.600
Yeah.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.560
You know, I mean, I think a lot of people, and I know certainly Alan's talked about it,

02:28.560 --> 02:33.280
but just that, you know, the idea of people opening ports in your firewall without your

02:33.280 --> 02:37.760
express permission or especially apps, maybe you're running proprietary applications that

02:37.760 --> 02:40.200
you don't, you know, you don't really have a handle on what it is they're sending.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.200
Right.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.840
So, that's a big problem that I see, you know, and that's why I don't use it on my own home

02:43.840 --> 02:48.640
network, but I know like in my parents' house, they have a ISP provided router that is UPnP

02:48.640 --> 02:52.040
and client, and well, I do have their, you know, admin password.

02:52.040 --> 02:54.240
Sometimes it's just easier if you're not, you know, I'm not going to be there for a

02:54.240 --> 02:55.240
long time.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.240
I don't need to leave a hole in their firewall.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.240
I can just open it up while I'm there.

02:58.240 --> 02:59.240
Sure.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.520
Well, that does sound really cool.

03:00.520 --> 03:01.700
I'll have to check that out.

03:01.700 --> 03:06.120
Maybe we can get a link in the show notes and then people can go check that out.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.240
Have you heard of Icebergs.io?

03:08.240 --> 03:11.520
I was just checking that out this morning, actually.

03:11.520 --> 03:12.520
Really?

03:12.520 --> 03:18.620
So, I had not heard of it before, but apparently Icebergs.io, Ubuntu with an XFCE gives a

03:18.620 --> 03:23.200
highly productive desktop experience in the browser with a quick and responsive on an

03:23.200 --> 03:25.200
all-modern internet connection.

03:25.200 --> 03:31.840
Now, they've actually optimized for touch devices, so you can run it on your phone,

03:31.840 --> 03:39.000
for example, and you can access what essentially is a mobile operating system through a web

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
browser.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Do I have that right?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Yeah, absolutely.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.080
You know, I just tried out the free account that gives you two compute hours a month,

03:47.080 --> 03:50.840
and it also won't save, so anytime you're done with it, whenever you turn it off, it's

03:50.840 --> 03:51.840
gone.

03:51.840 --> 03:55.680
Whereas if you upgrade to a paid plan, then they'll be persistent.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.320
How do they calculate a compute hour?

03:57.320 --> 03:58.320
You know, I'm not sure.

03:58.320 --> 04:02.080
I haven't looked into that yet, but that will be the sticking point because while they do

04:02.080 --> 04:06.480
give you, the first paid plan I think is like $10 a month, and they give you two instances,

04:06.480 --> 04:09.360
but you're also limited to compute hours there as well.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.720
25 of them, if I'm not mistaken, right?

04:11.720 --> 04:12.720
Yes, I believe so.

04:12.720 --> 04:17.600
I think you can have multiple instances running, and each of those adds up to your compute

04:17.600 --> 04:21.600
hours, but exactly how that gets built, we should check that out.

04:21.600 --> 04:22.600
I was impressed though.

04:22.600 --> 04:26.660
You know, it took a little bit to start up, but once everything was going, it was surprisingly

04:26.660 --> 04:30.800
responsive and pretty easy to use.

04:30.800 --> 04:36.640
Now for $9 a month, I could see this being really useful, and I've actually tried to

04:36.640 --> 04:37.640
implement this.

04:37.640 --> 04:38.640
I don't know.

04:38.640 --> 04:39.640
Have you played with X2Go very much?

04:39.640 --> 04:40.640
Yes.

04:40.640 --> 04:41.640
Yes, I have.

04:41.640 --> 04:46.240
You know, I frequently recommend it to people just because it's so easy to start using,

04:46.240 --> 04:50.200
and it works a lot faster than most of the other alternatives.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.000
So yes, I don't think I would...

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
For the price point of Icebergs.io, I'm not sure it's there for me yet.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.680
Oh, really?

04:57.680 --> 04:59.040
Well, that depends.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.720
That depends on how willing you are to roll your own solution.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.000
Yeah, that's true.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
That's true.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.920
Because if you already have the skills or the infrastructure to set up an X2Go server

05:07.920 --> 05:13.680
with an environment of your choosing, provided you have enough bandwidth, then that would

05:13.680 --> 05:15.120
probably be my preferred solution.

05:15.120 --> 05:21.680
But I am intrigued by the idea of desktop Linux in the browser at a whim, kind of.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.520
You know, so there are a couple of things that stand out to me.

05:23.520 --> 05:30.160
One is, if you go with the service type solution, you're essentially cloudifying your existence,

05:30.160 --> 05:31.880
and in doing so, you're losing control of your data.

05:31.880 --> 05:36.400
One of the things I like about my X2Go machine is that it physically sits inside of my office.

05:36.400 --> 05:41.400
I can go put my hand on it, and I know where that hard drive is at all times.

05:41.400 --> 05:45.600
And there are some additional benefits to having that device physically located in a

05:45.600 --> 05:46.600
place I can get to it.

05:46.600 --> 05:52.520
For example, I have a little SATA hard drive reader that is plugged into my X2Go machine.

05:52.520 --> 05:56.560
And so, if I have a lot of things off a staff member, they'll say, hey, boss, you know,

05:56.560 --> 06:00.680
we're doing XYZ, and we're having a problem with it, and you know, I can't get this file

06:00.680 --> 06:05.600
to open, or I can't get this file to do this, or I can't get these permissions done on this.

06:05.600 --> 06:09.360
And I'll say, well, just take the hard drive and stick it into my drive reader.

06:09.360 --> 06:12.760
And they can put it into the drive reader, and then from wherever I am, I can access

06:12.760 --> 06:13.760
that data.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.620
And then I can, you know, I can move it over to my laptop so I can work with it locally

06:16.620 --> 06:21.800
if I need to, or 90% of the time, 99% of the time, I can get my work done actually on the

06:21.800 --> 06:25.360
X2Go machine, provided I have a decent internet connection.

06:25.360 --> 06:31.480
And that is, that's something that no matter how robust and how cool Iceberg becomes, I'll

06:31.480 --> 06:33.520
always be missing that functionality, right?

06:33.520 --> 06:38.040
So, it limits my ability to scale, I think, a little bit.

06:38.040 --> 06:41.440
You know, I would, I would agree, and I think it ties into a lot of what some of our user

06:41.440 --> 06:45.400
base, you know, a lot of the Linux user base has problems with a lot of proprietary software,

06:45.400 --> 06:50.260
you know, one for maybe philosophical reasons, but also just because when you hit the edges

06:50.260 --> 06:53.400
of things, you know, when you hit, you try to stretch something to a little bit different

06:53.400 --> 06:57.920
purpose, or you need to customize something on a one-off thing, you're met with boundaries.

06:57.920 --> 07:02.160
Whereas if you've rolled it yourself, you used free open source software, time is just

07:02.160 --> 07:05.760
the limit for how much you can accomplish, you know, on the thing of the day.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.520
Something though, that's interesting that it's like, it's kind of like a similar option,

07:08.520 --> 07:11.240
but it's more of a app-based thing.

07:11.240 --> 07:15.840
It's called RollApp, and it's rollapp.com.

07:15.840 --> 07:23.720
And basically it does a server rendering of an application to your web browser, and it

07:23.720 --> 07:25.680
also works on your phone too.

07:25.680 --> 07:29.840
So in a way, like I've tested it and you can actually like use LibreOffice on your phone

07:29.840 --> 07:31.840
through this service.

07:31.840 --> 07:32.840
Wow.

07:32.840 --> 07:33.840
Wow.

07:33.840 --> 07:34.840
That sounds slick.

07:34.840 --> 07:38.960
It's actually like $7 a month or something, and you get like unlimited usage or whatever.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.800
And it's impressive.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.360
Like it works on your phone, it works on your tablet, it works on your web browser, and

07:44.360 --> 07:46.560
it does like all different kinds of apps.

07:46.560 --> 07:50.920
Like I think their total count is like 200 or something, but I tested with LibreOffice

07:50.920 --> 07:55.320
and it actually is like not the most latest version, but it is like the next latest.

07:55.320 --> 07:58.680
So like 5.0.1 or something like that.

07:58.680 --> 07:59.680
Sure, sure.

07:59.680 --> 08:03.560
But it actually works quite well, and they have like custom features built into the app

08:03.560 --> 08:09.480
so that you have like double tap or two finger tap the phone to lay out a toolbar and all

08:09.480 --> 08:10.480
kinds of stuff.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.220
Like it's pretty impressive.

08:12.220 --> 08:16.280
Can you give us an idea or an example of something that you've used with it?

08:16.280 --> 08:19.760
I've just used LibreOffice with it so far.

08:19.760 --> 08:20.760
Okay.

08:20.760 --> 08:21.760
Okay.

08:21.760 --> 08:25.200
Yeah, but actually even that alone, I could see tremendous use case for it.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.200
Yeah.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.200
And it actually supports GIMP too.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.200
Oh wow, really?

08:28.200 --> 08:30.000
You can do imaging and everything, yeah.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.240
Can you imagine the practicality of doing that?

08:32.240 --> 08:36.440
Can you imagine the practicality of like modifying this image, like especially with like a touchscreen

08:36.440 --> 08:37.440
device or something?

08:37.440 --> 08:41.720
I know people are already complaining about GIMP's UI and now we'll hear no end to it.

08:41.720 --> 08:42.720
Yeah, yeah.

08:42.720 --> 08:43.720
Exactly.

08:43.720 --> 08:44.720
Exactly, right?

08:44.720 --> 08:48.240
In this case, you could probably maybe if you had like the single window mode is what

08:48.240 --> 08:53.040
is necessary for like desktop stuff, but maybe on the phone, the separate windows would be

08:53.040 --> 08:56.360
better because you could like full screen on the phone each of the windows.

08:56.360 --> 08:59.640
I don't know, it might be a better solution.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.280
Yeah.

09:01.280 --> 09:05.200
So when Chris was here, we did some electrical upgrades to the RV.

09:05.200 --> 09:11.640
I don't know if some of you, if you're patrons, you got the email from it and he actually

09:11.640 --> 09:12.640
recorded a video.

09:12.640 --> 09:13.640
That's pretty cool.

09:13.640 --> 09:19.200
But essentially what we've tried to do is get everything to run off of 12 volts and

09:19.200 --> 09:24.560
the advantage of that DC 12 volt is that one is he can charge on the solar panel and two

09:24.560 --> 09:28.560
is he can actually run all of his equipment then off of those batteries.

09:28.560 --> 09:32.120
So he's not reliant upon AC power.

09:32.120 --> 09:37.240
I don't know, Wes or Rotten Corpse, have you guys had any experience with self-sufficient

09:37.240 --> 09:39.240
powering yourself?

09:39.240 --> 09:40.240
Not myself.

09:40.240 --> 09:44.680
I have some friends who live on the big island of Hawaii and they're working on setting up

09:44.680 --> 09:46.240
a hydroelectric system.

09:46.240 --> 09:47.880
Oh, cool.

09:47.880 --> 09:52.560
But before that, they were kind of reliant on friends' use of electricity to charge a

09:52.560 --> 09:55.320
lot of the batteries they had, so they had already converted a lot of their infrastructure

09:55.320 --> 09:59.120
to DC when they started playing around with this hydro.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.360
So it was kind of interesting to see, you know, they had lots of, kind of the same kind

10:01.360 --> 10:05.360
of modular setup, kind of plugging everything, every which way with those, they had the same

10:05.360 --> 10:07.440
kind of connectors you were highlighting on the show.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.440
Really?

10:08.440 --> 10:09.440
Yeah.

10:09.440 --> 10:10.440
The Anderson Power Bowls.

10:10.440 --> 10:11.440
Yeah, yeah.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.880
They were, they were showing, I didn't remember the name, but when you, when you show that

10:12.880 --> 10:15.480
on the show, I was like, oh, those, that's exactly what they had going on.

10:15.480 --> 10:19.600
You know, I don't mean to go fanboyish, but I absolutely love Anderson Power Bowls.

10:19.600 --> 10:25.160
If you're not familiar with them, they are genderless low voltage connectors.

10:25.160 --> 10:29.120
And so essentially they'll handle up to like 30 amps, the small ones, they have bigger

10:29.120 --> 10:33.340
ones that'll handle like up to 250 amps, but it's a different, it's a, it's a bigger version

10:33.340 --> 10:34.960
of the, of the smaller Anderson Power Bowl.

10:34.960 --> 10:39.800
But the 30 amp guys, they, you can put them on to, I've used them on 12-Aug wire, I've

10:39.800 --> 10:45.000
used them on, I think I've used them as high as 10-Aug wire and as small as 18-Aug wire.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.720
You have to fold the 18 over a little bit and use some solder, but the nice thing is

10:48.720 --> 10:49.720
they're genderless.

10:49.720 --> 10:54.040
So you don't have to decide, is this going to be a power receiving source or a power

10:54.040 --> 10:55.800
providing source?

10:55.800 --> 10:58.600
You can, you, they can, you can be interchangeable with it.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.920
And that's the case when it comes to something like a battery, sometimes the battery is providing

11:01.920 --> 11:08.040
the energy and other times the batteries is receiving the energy from like a charger.

11:08.040 --> 11:12.460
And so it, it offers a tremendous amount of flexibility and because of the standardization,

11:12.460 --> 11:18.280
it will hopefully the idea is that it will give Chris the freedom to plug things in willy

11:18.280 --> 11:19.280
nilly.

11:19.280 --> 11:22.360
If he has to make a change on the fly, that becomes, you know, very big, very easy to

11:22.360 --> 11:23.360
do.

11:23.360 --> 11:27.960
Now it's interesting that you say that they're using, that they're using hydroelectric.

11:27.960 --> 11:31.840
And that's DC because if you're, you, if you start with DC, if you generate DC and then

11:31.840 --> 11:35.880
you run it off of DC, you're not losing any energy in a conversion process.

11:35.880 --> 11:36.880
Right, right.

11:36.880 --> 11:37.880
Yeah.

11:37.880 --> 11:38.880
I think that's what they were going for.

11:38.880 --> 11:42.720
You know, once they've got that running, they'll almost be self-sufficient except they, they're

11:42.720 --> 11:46.960
still importing a large amount of propane for, for a lot of their utilities, but, but

11:46.960 --> 11:50.760
other than that, they're, they've got their own farm going.

11:50.760 --> 11:51.760
It's quite the project.

11:51.760 --> 11:52.760
Awesome.

11:52.760 --> 11:56.200
Anything else we want to cover in the pre-show before we get started?

11:56.200 --> 12:01.320
I mean, if you want to go back to the icebergs thing, you could mention that there's os.js

12:01.320 --> 12:02.920
if you wanted to.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.720
Tell me about os.js.

12:04.720 --> 12:09.680
It's a JavaScript based operating system thing and it's not full fledged or anything, but

12:09.680 --> 12:14.280
it is legitimately ran through the browser, like dependent on the browser.

12:14.280 --> 12:15.280
Okay.

12:15.280 --> 12:20.360
So it's, it's, it has got a few, it's got a, it's mostly web app based, but it has other

12:20.360 --> 12:21.360
things too.

12:21.360 --> 12:25.640
Like it can run stuff on the backend and it, you can like put it, you can, you can install

12:25.640 --> 12:33.000
it on like a DO droplet or something and have a interesting operating system available at

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
any time.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.040
It's not, it's not like X2GO or anything, but it's still interesting.

12:38.040 --> 12:41.960
See that, anything that, anything that I can install on top of a droplet or anything that

12:41.960 --> 12:48.040
I can install quickly and then access everywhere has, has huge appeal to me because I can think

12:48.040 --> 12:52.040
of so many practical places of where I could, where I could use something like that.

12:52.040 --> 12:53.040
Have you tried it?

12:53.040 --> 12:54.040
Yeah, I've tried it.

12:54.040 --> 12:58.200
I haven't, I haven't put it on my own droplet, but I've tried their demo and it's, it's interesting.

12:58.200 --> 13:04.680
It actually has like its own custom UI and everything and it runs apps pretty fast.

13:04.680 --> 13:08.140
I mean, if you have to have a pretty good machine to do it though.

13:08.140 --> 13:12.600
But it's, all I can say is interesting.

13:12.600 --> 13:16.760
It's not practical at all right now, but it is, it is fun to play with.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.960
You know, the nice thing about having its own UI is I bet it actually runs a little

13:19.960 --> 13:22.680
bit more efficiently inside of a web browser then, huh?

13:22.680 --> 13:23.680
Oh yeah.

13:23.680 --> 13:28.680
It actually has like, I mean, I can't really describe the UI, but it had like the menu

13:28.680 --> 13:31.440
system it uses is similar to like a Gnome 2 style.

13:31.440 --> 13:32.440
Wow.

13:32.440 --> 13:35.800
Do you know what the, the license is on that?

13:35.800 --> 13:36.800
I'm pretty sure.

13:36.800 --> 13:37.800
I know it's open source.

13:37.800 --> 13:41.160
I'm pretty sure it's GPL'd.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.160
That's that's awesome.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.760
I, I, I'll have to take a look at that there.

13:45.760 --> 13:49.160
My problem is when I run into things that like compete with something that is already

13:49.160 --> 13:53.680
working so well, I have a hard time prying myself off of my current solution.

13:53.680 --> 13:57.020
So for example, in this case, X2GO has worked for me so well and I've been able to get so

13:57.020 --> 14:01.920
much done with X2GO that I'm having a really hard time.

14:01.920 --> 14:08.400
I would have a really hard time prying myself away from X2GO to, to, to try something else

14:08.400 --> 14:11.180
even if that something else is better and, and it wouldn't be the first time that I've

14:11.180 --> 14:17.760
gone back and decided, oh yeah, actually, you know, XYZ worked a lot better the second

14:17.760 --> 14:18.760
time around.

14:18.760 --> 14:19.760
I just didn't know that it existed.

14:19.760 --> 14:20.760
Yeah.

14:20.760 --> 14:21.760
Okay.

14:21.760 --> 14:25.680
So this one doesn't have, it's not GPL'd, it's a license that technically would be compatible,

14:25.680 --> 14:27.400
but it's very limited in the license.

14:27.400 --> 14:33.680
It's basically just keep the copyright there and then whatever else, you know, user your

14:33.680 --> 14:34.680
own risk type thing.

14:34.680 --> 14:37.080
But I wouldn't say that this was better than X2GO.

14:37.080 --> 14:42.480
I think that X2GO is probably the best solution for someone who wants to roll their own cloud

14:42.480 --> 14:45.800
based servers or desktop, whatever.

14:45.800 --> 14:50.720
But I would say that if somebody wants just to kind of run stuff through the web roll

14:50.720 --> 14:56.400
app is definitely worth looking into, especially considering you'd have like LibreOffice on

14:56.400 --> 15:00.000
your phone and you could also roll it out to like hundreds of people and have the same

15:00.000 --> 15:02.280
version available to all of them.

15:02.280 --> 15:03.280
That's pretty awesome.

15:03.280 --> 15:07.720
And you know, the thing is X2GO, I know that there are extensions that you go run inside

15:07.720 --> 15:12.740
of Firefox, but primarily it's designed to be run inside of its own native client app.

15:12.740 --> 15:13.740
It's not, you know what I mean?

15:13.740 --> 15:17.440
It wasn't really designed to run, you know, in the browser.

15:17.440 --> 15:21.720
So something that is, that is designed from the ground up to run in the browser, I like

15:21.720 --> 15:25.600
again, I would think that would be a little bit more efficient, maybe have a little bit

15:25.600 --> 15:29.040
more pleasant of an experience to it.

15:29.040 --> 15:45.920
This is Linux Unplugged episode 112 for September 29th, 2015.

15:45.920 --> 15:50.040
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux show that's being brought to you today by

15:50.040 --> 15:52.680
nothing short of a freaking miracle.

15:52.680 --> 15:55.680
My name is Nolan, joining me from the Seattle studio is Wes.

15:55.680 --> 15:59.480
Hey guys, it's Wes, pleasure to be here.

15:59.480 --> 16:04.960
Now it's my honor and privilege to step in anytime Chris is off exploring somewhere yonder

16:04.960 --> 16:08.300
this week, as it turns out in Utah, in the Jupiter Rover.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.620
By the way, did you know that you can get minute by minute updates and follow his adventures

16:11.620 --> 16:15.120
over at JupiterBroadcasting.com slash Rover?

16:15.120 --> 16:19.080
Some of you might be wondering what I meant when I said that the show is being brought

16:19.080 --> 16:20.960
to you today by a miracle.

16:20.960 --> 16:23.360
And the answer actually starts back on Saturday at the meetup.

16:23.360 --> 16:26.940
So first of all, huge shout out to North Ranger, who's in our chat room right now.

16:26.940 --> 16:31.560
And everyone else that made the meetup on Saturday in Grand Forks, following Chris's

16:31.560 --> 16:34.440
arrival and then subsequently his departure.

16:34.440 --> 16:37.680
We were sitting down, we're having pizza, and we started talking about what the rest

16:37.680 --> 16:39.580
of Chris's trip is going to look like.

16:39.580 --> 16:43.840
And it is going to be, he's going through Utah.

16:43.840 --> 16:47.960
And so we laid out a map, a route for him to take, and we're all kind of figuring that

16:47.960 --> 16:48.960
out.

16:48.960 --> 16:55.960
And if he had the cellular connectivity over his planned route, he was not going to have

16:55.960 --> 16:56.960
coverage.

16:56.960 --> 16:59.840
And if he did have coverage, he would have to drive like 10 hours in between Koda Radio

16:59.840 --> 17:02.160
and Linux Unplugged to make both shows work.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.160
That sounds fun.

17:03.160 --> 17:04.160
Yeah, it sounded great, right?

17:04.160 --> 17:05.160
It sounds like a great one.

17:05.160 --> 17:09.280
So Sunday, he figured that out and he goes, you know, would you mind stepping up and helping

17:09.280 --> 17:10.280
do the show?

17:10.280 --> 17:12.880
And I said, yeah, I would love to, because Linux Unplugged is one of my favorite shows.

17:12.880 --> 17:16.520
I love the community aspect and I'm friends with a lot of the people in the mumble room.

17:16.520 --> 17:21.960
So it's kind of fun that instead of just, you know, chewing the straw off the air, you

17:21.960 --> 17:27.800
know, at two in the morning, now we can all be on air and have productive conversations.

17:27.800 --> 17:32.440
But the studio wasn't really set up for that because when Chris got here, we had reorganized

17:32.440 --> 17:36.340
the way the studio was set up to accommodate the shows that he wanted to do in the way

17:36.340 --> 17:37.540
that he wanted to do them.

17:37.540 --> 17:42.900
And then additionally, my studio isn't really set up for hosting shows with music coming

17:42.900 --> 17:44.800
in and all of this other stuff.

17:44.800 --> 17:50.680
So I ended up buying some more audio interfaces and some new cables and redid everything Monday

17:50.680 --> 17:55.640
to make things just more smooth so that we could go on the air and do this today.

17:55.640 --> 18:00.960
Tuesday I wake up and my first trouble call is not from a client.

18:00.960 --> 18:04.660
It's from my own office and my staff calls me and they're like, hey boss, guess what?

18:04.660 --> 18:06.160
The internet went out today.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.520
And I'm thinking, oh no, this isn't good.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.520
Yeah.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.520
No, we're an IT company.

18:10.520 --> 18:11.520
We can't not have internet.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.520
We have no access to emails.

18:12.520 --> 18:13.920
We have no access to our SIP phone system.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.380
We have no access to our work order system.

18:15.380 --> 18:16.680
We can't get to the call center.

18:16.680 --> 18:21.000
I have no idea what's going on in my own company and as I'm trying to sort that headache out,

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
it dawns on me.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.860
Oh no, I have luck this afternoon.

18:24.860 --> 18:28.260
So I immediately stop what I'm doing and I'm like, you guys fix the internet.

18:28.260 --> 18:31.220
I have to get stuff ready so I can do love in a couple of hours.

18:31.220 --> 18:34.220
So I start, I grabbed extra mixers and I'm grabbing audio cables and I'm grabbing cables

18:34.220 --> 18:37.880
and microphones and I'm, I have all this stuff in my arms and I'm running down.

18:37.880 --> 18:40.080
And Wes, have you ever done this thing where your arms are full and you start trying to

18:40.080 --> 18:43.200
like fish your keys out with your pinky and you're like, you don't want to drop anything,

18:43.200 --> 18:46.900
but you're, you don't, there's no real way to set a clump of stuff down.

18:46.900 --> 18:50.280
Every moment knowing you're going closer and closer to everything on the ground.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.280
Yes.

18:51.280 --> 18:52.280
Exactly.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.420
So I'm doing that and I finally fish my keys out and I get the car unlocked and then it

18:54.420 --> 18:57.000
dawns on me, where am I going to go?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Where am I going to go?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Because I can't go home.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.600
My house is for sale and there's an open house today.

19:01.600 --> 19:05.200
And even if there wasn't an open house today, people are looking at the house every couple

19:05.200 --> 19:06.200
of hours.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.740
And even if that weren't the case, I have two kids, two dogs and one wife, a Learjet

19:09.740 --> 19:12.580
taking off is more quiet than my house is.

19:12.580 --> 19:14.480
And so I decided I'm going to take over my in-laws house.

19:14.480 --> 19:18.200
I'll just, I'll go over there and I'll set up all of my stuff and I'll just, I will do

19:18.200 --> 19:22.280
the show from my in-laws house, all willy nilly like, and kick them out of their house.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.680
That seemed like a good idea.

19:23.680 --> 19:24.680
Easy peasy.

19:24.680 --> 19:25.680
Yeah.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.320
And thank God it didn't actually come to that.

19:28.320 --> 19:32.400
Mid continent in their infinite wisdom was able to get the problem resolved very quickly.

19:32.400 --> 19:36.540
Made a call with within one hour, they had an internet backup and I'm able to safely

19:36.540 --> 19:42.240
do the show from my studio and we seem to have a working internet connection out to

19:42.240 --> 19:43.240
Seattle.

19:43.240 --> 19:48.320
And so Wes can join me and thus this is Linux Unplugged and we have a cool show, I think

19:48.320 --> 19:49.320
lined up.

19:49.320 --> 19:50.320
Don't we?

19:50.320 --> 19:51.320
Yes, we do.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.320
Oh man.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.320
That is quite the story.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.320
It's wonderful to be here with you.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.320
And now I know all that.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.320
Yeah.

19:56.320 --> 20:00.560
So I want to start out first with a, with a little bit of feedback.

20:00.560 --> 20:04.840
Our first piece of feedback comes in from Mathis and he writes in with hi DPI versus

20:04.840 --> 20:05.840
VGA.

20:05.840 --> 20:10.600
And he goes, hi Wes and Noah, in three years I will still have my VGA ports for two reasons.

20:10.600 --> 20:15.960
One, VGA will still be a superior connector and two, CRT monitors that will, that I will

20:15.960 --> 20:20.360
still be using only have VGA, I think, and RCA.

20:20.360 --> 20:22.840
Appreciate and love all your netcasts, Mathis.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.120
I wanted to get your take on that.

20:24.120 --> 20:29.160
Do you think that VGA is still going to be a thing in, in the next five years?

20:29.160 --> 20:30.520
Well, we'll see.

20:30.520 --> 20:35.100
I didn't think laptops with less than full HD would be a thing three years ago, but it

20:35.100 --> 20:36.100
still is.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.400
So I could see them still having VGA connectors.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.400
I can too.

20:39.400 --> 20:43.040
You know, and it, it's a decent form factor.

20:43.040 --> 20:47.000
It does, you know, it's analog, so it just, just works even if it's not, you know, it

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
doesn't have fancy features.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
You can't really chain it.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.600
It doesn't, you know, it doesn't have the, the kind of resolution that a lot of us would

20:51.600 --> 20:53.880
like to see these days.

20:53.880 --> 20:58.900
I imagine that at least some section of the hardware market will still contain VGA.

20:58.900 --> 20:59.900
Will I be using it?

20:59.900 --> 21:00.900
Huh?

21:00.900 --> 21:01.900
We'll see.

21:01.900 --> 21:02.900
I think so too.

21:02.900 --> 21:06.000
I, I agree with him when he says that VGA is a superior connector, if only because of

21:06.000 --> 21:07.200
the two little knobs on the side.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.200
Oh, I love the knobs.

21:08.200 --> 21:12.000
Yeah, me too, because then you can securely connect it to the freaking computer.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
So it doesn't get ripped out.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.120
It makes tons of sense.

21:15.120 --> 21:16.400
I don't know why we went away from that.

21:16.400 --> 21:20.800
And you know, the same thing could be said about serial versus USB the, the, the DB nine

21:20.800 --> 21:23.200
connector had little screw things.

21:23.200 --> 21:27.040
And like when you attach one of those puppies to the computer, it never crossed your mind

21:27.040 --> 21:29.120
if the cable was going to get pulled out or become disconnected.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.600
Like that just wasn't a thing.

21:30.600 --> 21:31.600
It worked.

21:31.600 --> 21:32.600
Yeah.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.520
If it was connected and it was tied down, it worked and you can trust that it was basically

21:34.520 --> 21:38.720
as secure as having it on the inside of the computer unless of course somebody like tried

21:38.720 --> 21:41.460
to climb up the back of the tower or something.

21:41.460 --> 21:42.800
You weren't going to break it off.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.920
And these days, like even before we started the show, I had to restart my machine because

21:45.920 --> 21:48.880
my USB connector came unplugged from the, from the computer.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.920
So I agree with you that it's, that it's a superior connector.

21:51.920 --> 21:56.040
I think that the lack of screen real estate is enough to make me switch.

21:56.040 --> 21:59.040
And I think it's going to be enough to make a lot of other people switch.

21:59.040 --> 22:03.400
I also find it convenient even just when I'm short on, you know, maybe I don't have splitters

22:03.400 --> 22:07.880
or I'm in a different situation and just, just having the extra VGA port that a lot

22:07.880 --> 22:11.240
of computers do have means I can, you know, have an extra monitor that I might not otherwise

22:11.240 --> 22:14.600
get without buying a specialty piece of hardware.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.720
Very good.

22:15.720 --> 22:20.880
Over at reddit.com slash r slash Linux action show, you can submit things of interest for

22:20.880 --> 22:25.800
this show or for our big show every week, the Linux action show.

22:25.800 --> 22:30.600
Twist X 77 writes in and he says, hi Chris, I've been a list, I've been a Linux tester

22:30.600 --> 22:34.360
for more than 10 years, but I've never actually had the possibility to use Linux as my main

22:34.360 --> 22:35.360
OS.

22:35.360 --> 22:39.520
I have finally done that almost two years ago and I'm really happy with Ubuntu Gnome.

22:39.520 --> 22:45.440
Well, I wanted to let you know that all my electronic devices today use an ACE that use

22:45.440 --> 22:49.440
an AC, have an internal rectifier and a regulator.

22:49.440 --> 22:54.960
So they end up using DC so many, so many times, just bypassing the rectifier part, you can

22:54.960 --> 22:59.240
hook up 12 volt or 24 volt directly from your RV's DC supply.

22:59.240 --> 23:02.880
I guess you probably, you guys already know that anyway, I'm an electrical engineer.

23:02.880 --> 23:08.200
And so if you want to know how to use a soldering iron, I could help you bypass those AC devices

23:08.200 --> 23:09.440
and use DC when possible.

23:09.440 --> 23:12.560
So let me know if you need any help with any electronic related problems.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.320
Last but not least, thanks for the great shows.

23:14.320 --> 23:17.760
I listened to you guys when going to work almost every day.

23:17.760 --> 23:20.680
Well thank you so much for writing and we really appreciate it.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.800
Actually I do have an electrical question for you.

23:22.800 --> 23:23.800
Oh, perfect.

23:23.800 --> 23:24.800
Yeah, I did.

23:24.800 --> 23:25.800
Yeah, that worked out right.

23:25.800 --> 23:31.440
So Chris has a compressor gate combo that runs on nine volt AC and I want to get it

23:31.440 --> 23:35.760
to preferable, eventually I need to get it to 12 volt DC, but I can live with a nine

23:35.760 --> 23:40.880
volt DC because I already have a step-down transformer from a 12 volt DC to nine volt

23:40.880 --> 23:41.880
DC.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.160
You could help me solve that problem.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.520
That would be a huge help.

23:45.520 --> 23:49.080
Jupiter broadcasting.com click on the contact link, choose Linux unplugged from the dropdown

23:49.080 --> 23:50.080
menu.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.280
And if you have a solution for that, or you would like to help me come up with a solution

23:53.280 --> 23:54.920
for that, that would be amazing.

23:54.920 --> 23:59.440
At the moment, to my knowledge, that's the only remaining thing that he has in the camper

23:59.440 --> 24:04.480
that he has to have on day-to-day production that isn't running on DC, so that'd be really

24:04.480 --> 24:07.920
cool if we could get that solved.

24:07.920 --> 24:12.480
Wes, have you been following Chris at the tracker?

24:12.480 --> 24:13.480
Yes I have.

24:13.480 --> 24:16.420
You know, it's a weird little voyeurism, but it's very enjoyable just to be able to kind

24:16.420 --> 24:19.800
of creep along as he adventures across the West.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.600
Did you watch him when he arrived into Grand Fork?

24:21.600 --> 24:22.600
Yes I did.

24:22.600 --> 24:24.400
It was awesome.

24:24.400 --> 24:31.380
I, it's been kind of funny because the tracker is actually in the truck, not in the RV itself.

24:31.380 --> 24:37.360
And so when he goes to like the market or whatever else, it's kind of funny because

24:37.360 --> 24:41.520
like people will come over and like knock on the door and say, oh hey, how's it going?

24:41.520 --> 24:43.520
Or they'll come find us, or him rather.

24:43.520 --> 24:48.960
In fact, I had even one of my employees took a selfie with the JB Rover.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.040
Oh wow, that's awesome.

24:51.040 --> 24:53.760
Yeah, he was trying to find me and I had left my phone at home.

24:53.760 --> 24:56.720
So he's like, oh, I'll just use a little Rover thing and I'll go find Chris.

24:56.720 --> 24:57.720
It was pretty neat.

24:57.720 --> 25:01.840
You know, I actually, I was looking at the equipment that he was using.

25:01.840 --> 25:04.920
Chris was showing me in detail how that Silver Cloud thing was working.

25:04.920 --> 25:11.000
And I actually went over to Amazon and I found a box for 35 bucks that kind of does the same

25:11.000 --> 25:15.880
thing where they will update your, where they'll update your status.

25:15.880 --> 25:21.160
But instead of charging like a monthly like account that you have to put money into in

25:21.160 --> 25:26.440
order to get a certain amount of updates, essentially you just provide your own GSM

25:26.440 --> 25:27.800
card and then it will update.

25:27.800 --> 25:28.800
Isn't that kind of cool?

25:28.800 --> 25:29.800
Oh, that sounds really neat.

25:29.800 --> 25:32.560
Kind of roll your own service and as long as you can, as long as you can reach them,

25:32.560 --> 25:34.120
they'll give you updates.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.120
Exactly.

25:35.120 --> 25:36.480
And I'm thinking I could get the cost down on this.

25:36.480 --> 25:40.800
I'm going to have to run this by Chris, but if, if someone were to go to linux.ting.com

25:40.800 --> 25:44.840
and you, you, the SIM cards right now are on sale for five bucks, so you could buy this

25:44.840 --> 25:48.640
SIM card for five bucks and, but you get $25 of credit, so you could use the rest of the

25:48.640 --> 25:51.640
$20 credit to pay for the first month of service.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.560
And with Ting, you're only going to pay for what you use.

25:53.560 --> 25:56.440
So in my case, what I'm talking about here is I would only be using data.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.680
I would just be updating my locations.

25:58.680 --> 26:01.680
I wouldn't be using text messages and I wouldn't be making phone calls.

26:01.680 --> 26:03.480
And so I'm not going to pay for that service.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.400
I'm just going to pay for the data that I'm using.

26:05.400 --> 26:09.400
Of course, if you do plan on sending text messages or making phone calls, they're moderately

26:09.400 --> 26:14.040
priced and you, because it's no contract, you can cancel the service at any time without

26:14.040 --> 26:15.040
any penalty.

26:15.040 --> 26:18.200
So I'd suggest everyone go over to linux.ting.com.

26:18.200 --> 26:22.920
Pick yourself out something nice and use that $25 we're going to get you for being a listener

26:22.920 --> 26:24.240
of the Linux Unplugged Show.

26:24.240 --> 26:27.720
A huge thanks to Ting for sponsoring the show.

26:27.720 --> 26:33.240
And it just goes to show you that the limit of what you can do with those devices is limited

26:33.240 --> 26:34.680
only by your imagination.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.520
You know, Ting really saved my butt this weekend.

26:36.520 --> 26:37.520
I just have to say.

26:37.520 --> 26:38.520
Oh really?

26:38.520 --> 26:39.520
Tell me about it.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.960
You know, I was working from home there doing some construction in the office, lots of concrete

26:41.960 --> 26:44.880
dust everywhere, nothing we wanted to be a part of.

26:44.880 --> 26:49.680
And you know, just as my shift was coming to an end, my ISP's connection of course decided

26:49.680 --> 26:50.680
to fail.

26:50.680 --> 26:51.680
It starts with the letter C.

26:51.680 --> 26:53.160
They planned that, you know?

26:53.160 --> 26:54.400
Yes, I believe that they did.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.320
It was just perfectly timed.

26:56.320 --> 26:59.720
But thanks to Ting, tethering, you know, it just uses your data.

26:59.720 --> 27:00.720
It's included in your plan.

27:00.720 --> 27:01.800
You don't have to worry about it.

27:01.800 --> 27:02.800
There's no fuss.

27:02.800 --> 27:08.000
So I was able to just spin up my LTE connection on my phone and I was VPN back in in no time.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
It was perfect.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
It saved my butt.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
That's for sure.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.520
If I think that I have found the limit of what I can do with Ting, I end up buying another

27:15.520 --> 27:16.520
device.

27:16.520 --> 27:20.280
Even when we were out, when we were out doing the meetup, I still get questions about that

27:20.280 --> 27:21.280
little credit card phone.

27:21.280 --> 27:22.680
Have I showed you that or have you seen it?

27:22.680 --> 27:23.760
Oh yeah, that is so cool.

27:23.760 --> 27:25.200
I'm thinking about just getting one.

27:25.200 --> 27:28.360
They seem so handy and you can just, you know, just keep it when you need it.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.400
And dude, they're 30 freaking dollars.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.400
That's amazing.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.600
Yeah, you can buy a brand new phone for 30 freaking dollars and you throw that $5 SIM

27:34.600 --> 27:37.680
card in there, which by the way, you won't pay for because Ting's going to give it to

27:37.680 --> 27:43.120
you for free by going to linux.ting.com and then you have $20 of service credit.

27:43.120 --> 27:46.800
And if you're like me, that paid for, that paid for my first month of service.

27:46.800 --> 27:52.280
And then if even with my wife and me and my son and my dad, who's all of which are on

27:52.280 --> 27:56.560
my plan now, I would still probably get a good chunk of that month paid for.

27:56.560 --> 27:59.760
Of course you can just buy a device.

27:59.760 --> 28:05.160
We're going to run over to blog.documentingfoundation.org and they published an article titled today,

28:05.160 --> 28:10.760
headline five years of LibreOffice, LibreOffice was launched as a fork of openoffice.org on

28:10.760 --> 28:15.480
September 28th, 2010 by a tiny group of people representing the community in their capacity

28:15.480 --> 28:17.580
of community project leaders.

28:17.580 --> 28:21.560
At the time it was a brave, although necessary decision because it was rather clear to everyone

28:21.560 --> 28:26.160
that openoffice.org was not going to survive for a long time under Oracle stewardship.

28:26.160 --> 28:30.160
In fact, the group of 16 founders launched an independent free software project under

28:30.160 --> 28:34.680
the stewardship of the Document Foundation to fulfill a promise made by Sun Microsystems

28:34.680 --> 28:36.280
10 years before.

28:36.280 --> 28:41.720
At the time, at the time of the first announcement of openoffice.org of the independent free

28:41.720 --> 28:46.060
software foundation capable of pushing forward the free office suite to the next level.

28:46.060 --> 28:50.480
After five years, LibreOffice is acknowledged in the marketplace as the sole Microsoft Office

28:50.480 --> 28:56.500
contender based on sheer feature by feature comparison and on the number of successful

28:56.500 --> 28:58.160
migrations.

28:58.160 --> 29:02.360
Migrating to LibreOffice has never been easier thanks to the migration protocol drafted by

29:02.360 --> 29:06.600
the most experienced people at the Document Foundation, which outlines the best practices

29:06.600 --> 29:10.520
adopted by several large projects worldwide.

29:10.520 --> 29:15.400
A success confirmed by the future of open source survey in 2015, which has put LibreOffice

29:15.400 --> 29:20.200
amongst the most seven valuable open source projects based on the answers provided by

29:20.200 --> 29:22.240
over 1,300 professionals worldwide.

29:22.240 --> 29:24.160
It has been an amazing journey.

29:24.160 --> 29:27.640
In five years, LibreOffice developers have not missed a single time-based release with

29:27.640 --> 29:32.480
major announcements in late January and late July and minor announcements on a monthly

29:32.480 --> 29:33.480
basis.

29:33.480 --> 29:37.840
Thanks to the sustained pace, LibreOffice has reached a richness and feature and a level

29:37.840 --> 29:41.120
of interoperability which are second to none.

29:41.120 --> 29:44.200
I use Office on a daily basis.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.200
How about you, Wes?

29:45.200 --> 29:46.200
Yeah, pretty much.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.240
Pretty much every day.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.240
You know what?

29:49.240 --> 29:52.520
I was trained as a Microsoft Office user specialist.

29:52.520 --> 29:56.520
So supposedly, I had these letters after my name that said I was supposed to know something

29:56.520 --> 29:58.160
about an Office suite.

29:58.160 --> 30:03.660
And as Microsoft Office continued to push newer and newer versions out, I found myself

30:03.660 --> 30:05.060
literally getting lost.

30:05.060 --> 30:09.280
And the most embarrassing thing, I think, to date that's ever happened to me in an Office

30:09.280 --> 30:17.760
suite was I was giving a presentation, and the presentation computer had the newest version

30:17.760 --> 30:18.760
of Microsoft Office.

30:18.760 --> 30:21.480
And this is when they switched to Ribbons, right?

30:21.480 --> 30:28.640
And I couldn't find a core function, and I had to look up to a group of IT professionals,

30:28.640 --> 30:29.640
and I'm presenting.

30:29.640 --> 30:31.300
So supposedly, I'm supposed to know something that they don't.

30:31.300 --> 30:34.180
I'm supposed to be teaching them something, and I had to ask them to come up and show

30:34.180 --> 30:36.960
me how to use a function of Microsoft Office.

30:36.960 --> 30:41.360
And it was about that time when I realized I didn't want to be beholden to Microsoft

30:41.360 --> 30:43.080
Office anymore.

30:43.080 --> 30:50.020
And I switched to LibreOffice, and ever since then, every client that comes to my company

30:50.020 --> 30:55.000
that is looking for help with an Office suite, we move them to LibreOffice as well.

30:55.000 --> 31:01.600
Do you use LibreOffice as like a daily driver, or is it something that you use just to modify

31:01.600 --> 31:04.040
a document or to write a letter or something like that?

31:04.040 --> 31:10.360
You know, it's definitely more of the latter, but I kind of started back with OpenOffice.

31:10.360 --> 31:13.460
I wasn't really a Linux user then, but to think about it, back in high school, my high

31:13.460 --> 31:16.940
school actually had Linux on a lot of the workstations.

31:16.940 --> 31:23.120
I remember getting in trouble for a long-running C program that I left running on the network.

31:23.120 --> 31:27.400
But we started with OpenOffice, and then I migrated to Microsoft Office when I was in

31:27.400 --> 31:31.620
college, and like you, I was also responsible for doing some training of people using those

31:31.620 --> 31:32.620
suites.

31:32.620 --> 31:33.620
Sure.

31:33.620 --> 31:37.080
And I have just been continually impressed with what the Document Foundation and LibreOffice

31:37.080 --> 31:38.080
have done.

31:38.080 --> 31:42.520
You know, even if you ignore the elephant in the room of Microsoft Office, they have

31:42.520 --> 31:51.320
just been able to create a standards-based, very usable productivity suite that if you

31:51.320 --> 31:56.160
use it, especially internally, if it's a consistent deployment, you can pretty much do anything

31:56.160 --> 32:02.160
that you would reasonably need to do efficiently, productively, and in a very pleasant environment.

32:02.160 --> 32:05.760
And they seem very responsive as well, so that new features get added, compatibility

32:05.760 --> 32:07.320
gets improved.

32:07.320 --> 32:11.880
It's really like a testament to the open source software in general.

32:11.880 --> 32:15.560
You know, Wes, I had a chance to head over to Red Hat, and when I was at Red Hat, I was

32:15.560 --> 32:20.560
talking to those guys, and I said, how is it that a billion-dollar company, a billion

32:20.560 --> 32:24.600
dollars, how is it that you guys manage to avoid using Microsoft Office?

32:24.600 --> 32:30.560
And he said, honestly, when it comes down to it, the basic stuff that you do in an office

32:30.560 --> 32:31.560
suite is there.

32:31.560 --> 32:33.160
Like, all the functionality is there.

32:33.160 --> 32:36.280
The way you go about doing it, sometimes the buttons are in little different locations.

32:36.280 --> 32:37.280
Yeah, exactly.

32:37.280 --> 32:41.520
Layouts are a little different, but the functionality is there.

32:41.520 --> 32:46.560
And so I think that people that say, oh, I can't do that in open office, or I can't do

32:46.560 --> 32:50.560
that in LibreOffice, I think those people, I think that's just a cop-out, and I think

32:50.560 --> 32:55.800
that it's not that you can't do it in LibreOffice, I think that 99% of the time, it's people

32:55.800 --> 32:57.280
just don't want to do it in LibreOffice.

32:57.280 --> 33:01.800
Yes, they don't want to warn that new workflow, and you know, that's a barrier, but if you

33:01.800 --> 33:05.560
get over it, it's a glorious thing on the other side.

33:05.560 --> 33:12.880
And the other thing is, too, is what I see is you are trading the comfortability of Microsoft

33:12.880 --> 33:16.320
Office for the known future of LibreOffice.

33:16.320 --> 33:21.480
I don't know what changes Microsoft is going to make, only Microsoft knows that, if Microsoft

33:21.480 --> 33:26.920
knows that, but when it comes to LibreOffice, I can have a voice in that conversation.

33:26.920 --> 33:30.160
I can reach out to the developers and say, hey, you know what, this is a feature I'm

33:30.160 --> 33:32.320
really looking forward to, and I do do that.

33:32.320 --> 33:37.000
When I bump into those guys, and they are at most Linux fests, when I bump into those

33:37.000 --> 33:40.440
guys, I tell them, I say, hey, this is the kind of feature I'm looking for, this is the

33:40.440 --> 33:45.500
kind of functionality I really need, is that something that you can accommodate?

33:45.500 --> 33:50.160
And most of the time, the answer is yes, sometimes the answer is no, and then usually with a

33:50.160 --> 33:54.980
yes, they're able to give a timeframe of about how long that's going to take before that

33:54.980 --> 33:55.980
functionality arrives.

33:55.980 --> 33:56.980
How about the Mumble Room?

33:56.980 --> 33:58.640
I kind of want to open it up to you guys.

33:58.640 --> 33:59.980
We haven't really even said hello to you guys.

33:59.980 --> 34:01.480
Time appropriate greeting, Mumble Room.

34:01.480 --> 34:13.400
As far as LibreOffice, I mean, the only thing that it can't do very well is the Microsoft

34:13.400 --> 34:19.280
Office formats, and it's still getting those much better in the recent releases.

34:19.280 --> 34:25.800
So I mean, as far as like most of the time, LibreOffice is all you really need.

34:25.800 --> 34:26.800
Yeah.

34:26.800 --> 34:30.200
I guess I suppose I'll have to backtrack just a little bit.

34:30.200 --> 34:31.480
I'll have to eat a couple of my words.

34:31.480 --> 34:38.680
I suppose if you're doing something very, very, very, some very special formula in Excel-based

34:38.680 --> 34:44.000
formula or something like that, I guess I could see a couple of times where it would

34:44.000 --> 34:48.200
be a lot of work to use LibreOffice instead of Microsoft Office, and that didn't really

34:48.200 --> 34:53.160
dawn on me until, Rotten, you had mentioned the concept of transitioning from one office

34:53.160 --> 34:57.680
suite to another and keeping file consistency.

34:57.680 --> 35:02.700
I have done that a couple of times, and 99% of the time it goes well, but you're right.

35:02.700 --> 35:06.560
Every once in a while, if there's a Microsoft Office format and you try and open that up

35:06.560 --> 35:12.520
in LibreOffice, something goes a little kiddy wonker, and then that causes some problems.

35:12.520 --> 35:21.960
There's also big companies that have implemented large software solutions which only integrate

35:21.960 --> 35:26.800
with Microsoft Office, and there's a big one that most large companies use, and that's

35:26.800 --> 35:31.520
LibreOffice, and for a long, long, long, long time, and it may still be the case, I haven't

35:31.520 --> 35:36.320
looked in the last three years, but while you're inside your SAP system dealing with

35:36.320 --> 35:41.240
your customers, your HR records, your finances, your materials management, whatever it is

35:41.240 --> 35:48.040
inside SAP, if you press any button that is export this as a document, the only thing

35:48.040 --> 35:50.000
it will talk to is Microsoft Office.

35:50.000 --> 35:55.520
You absolutely cannot integrate with LibreOffice or OpenOffice or any other office suite.

35:55.520 --> 36:01.240
It just doesn't do it, because really, if you're implementing SAP, you're a Fortune

36:01.240 --> 36:06.560
500 company and many more, and you could be pretty much guaranteed that the desktops will

36:06.560 --> 36:10.000
have Microsoft Windows and they will have Microsoft Office.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
Exactly.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.600
There's no point in them even implementing that kind of integration.

36:13.600 --> 36:17.320
That may well have changed in the last three years, but I seriously doubt it.

36:17.320 --> 36:22.520
How about letting that software export to Microsoft Office and then opening it with

36:22.520 --> 36:23.520
LibreOffice?

36:23.520 --> 36:27.000
Well, it's not just a case of exporting data out.

36:27.000 --> 36:32.840
It doesn't spit data out as like an XLS file or a doc.

36:32.840 --> 36:40.320
This is reaching into the Office install on your machine, placing calls into the application,

36:40.320 --> 36:43.240
so it integrates tightly, and it might even embed.

36:43.240 --> 36:47.680
You might be looking at a screen in SAP, and then you press a button that says, give me

36:47.680 --> 36:51.640
a graph, and that reaches into your machine, downloads some stuff to your machine, and

36:51.640 --> 36:59.600
then makes some system calls into Microsoft Office that then renders that inside the GUI

36:59.600 --> 37:01.240
for the application.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.400
And SAP is not the only one.

37:02.400 --> 37:06.500
It's the one I've got most familiarity with, but there are plenty of these Office applications

37:06.500 --> 37:11.180
which are used by large companies and which there is no way you're going to move these

37:11.180 --> 37:16.200
people off of Microsoft Office, because they're dependent upon something which costs them

37:16.200 --> 37:18.840
millions and millions in maintenance fees every year.

37:18.840 --> 37:20.320
They're not just going to switch away from that.

37:20.320 --> 37:21.320
That's just not going to happen.

37:21.320 --> 37:26.160
So it's somewhat, I mean, for small and medium-sized enterprises and for the people who are doing

37:26.160 --> 37:29.080
the basic stuff and home users, yes, LibreOffice is perfectly fine.

37:29.080 --> 37:33.800
For education, yes, perfectly fine, but for the very large deployments, it's a lot more

37:33.800 --> 37:34.800
difficult.

37:34.800 --> 37:41.080
Now, do you think those companies are not taking into account a certain level of risk

37:41.080 --> 37:45.640
by banking on the fact that their software is going to continue to talk to Microsoft

37:45.640 --> 37:50.400
and that Microsoft is going to continue to provide Microsoft Office in a way that that

37:50.400 --> 37:51.400
software can talk to it?

37:51.400 --> 37:56.560
So for example, look at Office 365, a lot of businesses have switched to Office 365.

37:56.560 --> 38:03.260
I would imagine that that to some degree changes the ability of a third-party software being

38:03.260 --> 38:06.400
able to talk directly to Microsoft Office, doesn't it?

38:06.400 --> 38:07.880
No, not at all.

38:07.880 --> 38:14.440
All these large software companies have people who work for Microsoft embedded in the company.

38:14.440 --> 38:18.160
They have people who work for Oracle embedded in the company.

38:18.160 --> 38:21.320
They have partner status with them, so they get access to this stuff early on, and they

38:21.320 --> 38:26.080
will integrate so that in the next release or the next release two years down the line,

38:26.080 --> 38:30.400
remember, corporates don't tend to move super fast upgrading their back-end ERP systems,

38:30.400 --> 38:35.160
and these people will say, coming in the next release or two releases down the line, we'll

38:35.160 --> 38:39.840
have integration with Office 365, and that'll be fine because significant numbers of those

38:39.840 --> 38:45.720
companies are still running on Windows 7 or some of them maybe even on Windows XP.

38:45.720 --> 38:48.760
They're not itching to move on to the next release.

38:48.760 --> 38:53.860
The reality is with Office 365, it is somewhat operating system independent.

38:53.860 --> 38:58.940
I can run Office 365 inside of Ubuntu, and it works just fine.

38:58.940 --> 39:02.360
Not necessarily recommending anyone should do that.

39:02.360 --> 39:08.160
But I wonder how that SAP system would talk in if it can't talk to the operating system.

39:08.160 --> 39:10.880
I bet that, would that screw it up?

39:10.880 --> 39:11.880
It's a prerequisite.

39:11.880 --> 39:18.200
I mean, if you were to try and install the GUI and you try and do something in the GUI

39:18.200 --> 39:22.160
that requires Microsoft Office and the client doesn't have Microsoft Office installed or

39:22.160 --> 39:27.800
it's not a Microsoft client, then that piece of functionality will fail.

39:27.800 --> 39:30.960
And the net result of that is that employee can't do their job.

39:30.960 --> 39:35.400
And if that employee can't do their job, then you're not going to migrate away from Windows.

39:35.400 --> 39:42.200
So it's a lot more complicated than just what's the most complicated Excel spreadsheet you

39:42.200 --> 39:43.200
can think of?

39:43.200 --> 39:48.320
Does it happen in LibreOffice or what's the most cunningly formatted Word document that

39:48.320 --> 39:52.920
makes sure it renders correctly inside LibreOffice docs?

39:52.920 --> 39:54.560
Most of those things are covered.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.280
Those bases are fine.

39:57.280 --> 40:01.640
It's when you're dependent upon Microsoft system calls and things like that that you're

40:01.640 --> 40:02.640
screwed.

40:02.640 --> 40:03.640
You can't move away.

40:03.640 --> 40:04.640
That makes total sense.

40:04.640 --> 40:05.640
I stand corrected.

40:05.640 --> 40:11.360
You know, I have obviously I have very limited experience with very, very large companies.

40:11.360 --> 40:14.560
Certainly have even less experience with very large companies that have very large deployments

40:14.560 --> 40:16.640
of Windows.

40:16.640 --> 40:20.040
But and I say that unashamedly.

40:20.040 --> 40:25.080
But there are certain things that I don't think Microsoft Office will ever be able to

40:25.080 --> 40:26.080
compete with LibreOffice.

40:26.080 --> 40:29.720
And one of them is, for example, the Document Freedom Day.

40:29.720 --> 40:34.520
And it's this idea that we can celebrate and raise awareness for the concept of open standards

40:34.520 --> 40:37.560
and I really wanted to participate in this last year.

40:37.560 --> 40:40.960
I'm really looking forward to participating in it next year.

40:40.960 --> 40:44.240
But and probably maybe you have have some insight.

40:44.240 --> 40:50.480
Did you personally or did you at work support or have any involvement with Document Freedom

40:50.480 --> 40:51.480
Day?

40:51.480 --> 40:56.560
So the last time I was involved in this was when it was before Document Freedom Day, when

40:56.560 --> 40:58.080
it was Software Freedom Day.

40:58.080 --> 41:02.160
Many, many, many years ago, there was a Software Freedom Day and we decided to take part in

41:02.160 --> 41:03.160
the UK.

41:03.160 --> 41:08.840
And in London, we had a bunch of CDs that were provided by Canonical, the Ubuntu CDs,

41:08.840 --> 41:12.040
and we had some leaflets that we printed out and we went for a walk.

41:12.040 --> 41:15.240
We all met up in a park in London, we went for a walk through London, and then we met

41:15.240 --> 41:21.440
up at a venue where we gave talks and talked about software freedom and all the all the

41:21.440 --> 41:27.040
kind of topics that you'd expect to hear at a conference or an event about software freedom.

41:27.040 --> 41:30.320
And as we walked through London, we were handing CDs.

41:30.320 --> 41:34.480
And you know, you know, those people who stand in the street who try and like thrust something

41:34.480 --> 41:37.280
into your hand and you really don't want to make eye contact and you don't want to talk

41:37.280 --> 41:38.280
to those people?

41:38.280 --> 41:39.840
Well, yeah, that was us.

41:39.840 --> 41:46.240
And in England, you know, I'm sure it's somewhat different, the British reserved personality

41:46.240 --> 41:50.560
where, you know, we'll do absolutely anything to avoid eye contact with you.

41:50.560 --> 41:54.880
And we would we were testing, like, as we walked along different phrases that we could

41:54.880 --> 42:00.040
use to get people to take the CD out of our hand like, you know, would you like some free

42:00.040 --> 42:01.560
software?

42:01.560 --> 42:04.980
And you know, free software, free culture or free, you know, we were trying all kinds

42:04.980 --> 42:06.120
of phrases.

42:06.120 --> 42:08.520
And some of them weren't better than others.

42:08.520 --> 42:10.160
I documented those.

42:10.160 --> 42:16.280
Yeah, well, we Yeah, we wrote up our, our, our event.

42:16.280 --> 42:21.680
But one particularly memorable, we were standing outside a store that was like, you know, like

42:21.680 --> 42:25.240
a Best Buy, like fries you would have over there as PC World over here.

42:25.240 --> 42:29.920
And it was at a junction where there was some traffic lights and a big red London basketball

42:29.920 --> 42:31.120
pulled up.

42:31.120 --> 42:36.360
And one of the guys took the opportunity to walk up to the bus driver and handed him one

42:36.360 --> 42:39.180
of the CDs and said, Hey, would you like some free software?

42:39.180 --> 42:42.720
And the guy looked at it and said, Ah, is this that replacement for Windows?

42:42.720 --> 42:47.360
And our guy went, Yes, that's exactly what it is.

42:47.360 --> 42:51.200
But this was like, nearly 10 years ago, eight years ago.

42:51.200 --> 42:54.480
And you know, people, some people knew about it back then.

42:54.480 --> 42:57.040
But no, I haven't been involved in the Document Freedom Day more recently.

42:57.040 --> 42:58.800
I know some people have, but I am.

42:58.800 --> 43:00.960
I would love to get more, more involved with that.

43:00.960 --> 43:05.480
And the stories that I've heard from people that have participated in are absolutely outstanding.

43:05.480 --> 43:09.280
And you can actually get some funding, as I understand it, from the Document Foundation

43:09.280 --> 43:17.560
for the Open Document Foundation for putting on a Document Freedom Day in your area.

43:17.560 --> 43:20.280
That's definitely something I'm going to look into.

43:20.280 --> 43:24.560
Anyone else in the mobile room have any experience with, with LibreOffice or enjoy using LibreOffice

43:24.560 --> 43:29.160
or more to the point experience with switching people from Microsoft Office to LibreOffice?

43:29.160 --> 43:34.920
Yeah, I've worked with several friends and family members that, you know, we just bypass

43:34.920 --> 43:40.360
the whole Microsoft Office compatibility issue entirely when you're creating documents for

43:40.360 --> 43:43.040
distribution, just save them as PDFs.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.040
Yeah, totally.

43:44.040 --> 43:46.040
That's a great option.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.800
PDFs are great.

43:47.800 --> 43:51.960
The thing that bothers me about PDFs is if, if anytime you need to edit something or change

43:51.960 --> 43:53.760
something right, that becomes kind of problematic.

43:53.760 --> 43:56.880
Wouldn't they have, didn't they have like an embedded format where you can embed a Open

43:56.880 --> 44:01.880
Office or a Open Document format in a PDF or maybe it was vice versa?

44:01.880 --> 44:03.040
Yeah, that could be.

44:03.040 --> 44:08.000
If they're, I'm not, I'm not personally familiar with it, but North Ranger, how about you?

44:08.000 --> 44:12.040
You know, I did not try that, but like the biggest example I had of, you know, distribution

44:12.040 --> 44:13.040
was resumes.

44:13.040 --> 44:14.040
Oh, sure.

44:14.040 --> 44:15.040
Yeah.

44:15.040 --> 44:16.040
Yeah.

44:16.040 --> 44:20.400
The nice thing about resumes is that you can actually download a lot of the templates for

44:20.400 --> 44:26.600
Microsoft Office, open them with LibreOffice and then go in there and, and, and just plug

44:26.600 --> 44:28.120
in the information and it works.

44:28.120 --> 44:31.280
And I've actually done that a couple of times or helped people do it a couple of times.

44:31.280 --> 44:33.040
Never really run into a snag doing that.

44:33.040 --> 44:39.120
There's also a Linux converter so that if it's just a command line tool that you run

44:39.120 --> 44:44.120
it, you can convert a PDF that doesn't have editability or have any texts connected to

44:44.120 --> 44:49.880
it and convert it into an editable format that is still PDF, but fundamentally lets you

44:49.880 --> 44:50.880
change things.

44:50.880 --> 44:51.880
Yeah.

44:51.880 --> 44:55.240
I just see on LibreOffice's website here, they have support for hybrid PDF where they

44:55.240 --> 44:56.680
do embed an ODF file.

44:56.680 --> 45:01.480
So a PDF viewers will see the PDF, but if you open LibreOffice, it's a fully modifiable.

45:01.480 --> 45:04.080
And I assume when you save it, then that's updates the PDF.

45:04.080 --> 45:05.400
Oh, that's great.

45:05.400 --> 45:06.400
Yeah.

45:06.400 --> 45:09.800
That's absolutely fantastic because the nice thing about that is it requires people that

45:09.800 --> 45:14.280
are, that the people that want to monkey with it are going to know how to monkey with it.

45:14.280 --> 45:17.360
And the people that don't know how to monkey with it probably aren't the people we want

45:17.360 --> 45:19.200
modifying the file anyway, right?

45:19.200 --> 45:20.200
Yeah.

45:20.200 --> 45:23.160
And there's no, there's no excuse with LibreOffice, you know, it's like you sent this document

45:23.160 --> 45:24.160
and you do want to edit it.

45:24.160 --> 45:25.360
Well, it's free software.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.720
You can download it at no cost.

45:26.720 --> 45:28.620
It's available for pretty much every platform.

45:28.620 --> 45:30.640
So you know, perfectly interoperable.

45:30.640 --> 45:33.640
Rotten Corpse, you want to jump in there?

45:33.640 --> 45:39.320
Well, I was just going to say that there is actually another, there's a, there's a cloud

45:39.320 --> 45:43.120
that this is not something you want to use if you care about like privacy of your stuff,

45:43.120 --> 45:47.520
but there's this cloud converters system.

45:47.520 --> 45:53.920
It's a service called a cloudconvert.io I think, and it, I've tested it in certain cases

45:53.920 --> 46:00.280
where you can convert a PDF, no matter what kind of weird formatting it has to anything

46:00.280 --> 46:01.280
you want.

46:01.280 --> 46:07.400
Like I tried to convert a PDF to an HTML file just to see if it would do it.

46:07.400 --> 46:08.400
And it did it perfectly.

46:08.400 --> 46:13.000
It had all the pages, how the formatting, like everything was perfect and it kind of

46:13.000 --> 46:18.040
blew my mind how like exact it did it, no matter what format I picked.

46:18.040 --> 46:19.200
That's awesome.

46:19.200 --> 46:24.400
It's worth saying for everything I've said about Microsoft Office, LibreOffice is incredibly

46:24.400 --> 46:31.160
flexible and over the last couple of years it's being bent into different shapes that

46:31.160 --> 46:34.460
you probably wouldn't have expected it to, or that you wouldn't have expected the same

46:34.460 --> 46:40.120
code base from so many years ago that originated, you know, StarOffice, OpenOffice and now LibreOffice

46:40.120 --> 46:47.360
that now, for example, there's a tool that's part of LibreOffice called LibreOffice Kit.

46:47.360 --> 46:53.660
And with LibreOffice Kit, you could take an installation of LibreOffice with no GUI, so

46:53.660 --> 46:57.200
you don't actually use LibreOffice on the desktop, but you could have an install of

46:57.200 --> 47:02.960
LibreOffice say on a headless server and with LibreOffice Kit you can pass it any supported

47:02.960 --> 47:07.640
LibreOffice document and it will give you back a bitmap of what that document looks

47:07.640 --> 47:08.640
like.

47:08.640 --> 47:09.640
No kidding.

47:09.640 --> 47:10.640
It's amazing.

47:10.640 --> 47:12.560
And we're actually using that on the Ubuntu phone.

47:12.560 --> 47:19.040
So the document viewer has inside it a copy of LibreOffice and when you open a document,

47:19.040 --> 47:23.640
it throws the document at LibreOffice through LibreOffice Kit, LibreOffice then renders

47:23.640 --> 47:27.200
the document, throws it back a bitmap and we display that on the screen and you just

47:27.200 --> 47:28.200
move that around.

47:28.200 --> 47:30.640
So you're scrolling the document as you're moving a bitmap around the screen.

47:30.640 --> 47:32.680
It's pretty amazing.

47:32.680 --> 47:34.480
And it does this all this in real time.

47:34.480 --> 47:35.480
Yeah.

47:35.480 --> 47:39.640
But you can throw it a bitmap and say, show me this part of the document.

47:39.640 --> 47:44.560
So if the user is zoomed in, you might want to show only the top left hand corner of the

47:44.560 --> 47:45.560
spreadsheet or something.

47:45.560 --> 47:47.960
So you tell LibreOffice Kit, here's the document.

47:47.960 --> 47:51.040
Show me the top left hand corner of that document and it will throw you back a bitmap only of

47:51.040 --> 47:52.040
that bit.

47:52.040 --> 47:55.160
When you page down, it will render only the second page and when you page down, it only

47:55.160 --> 47:56.160
renders the third page.

47:56.160 --> 48:01.160
So it's incredibly flexible what you can do with LibreOffice and in some ways more

48:01.160 --> 48:04.040
flexible than Microsoft Office.

48:04.040 --> 48:05.720
And I think that's a good note to end on that.

48:05.720 --> 48:09.080
Well, I guess this is another good note to end on.

48:09.080 --> 48:13.120
LibreOffice 5.0 launched in early August and has been the most successful major release

48:13.120 --> 48:17.520
ever, triggering an unprecedented 8,000 donations in just 30 days.

48:17.520 --> 48:21.880
Of course, the success had been reflected in the number of adoptions, which has soared.

48:21.880 --> 48:25.200
The icing on the cake has been the announcement of the Italian Defense Organization, which

48:25.200 --> 48:34.280
will be migrating some 150,000 PCs to LibreOffice starting from October in 2015.

48:34.280 --> 48:38.600
You know, I think it was last month or the month before actually we went over into a

48:38.600 --> 48:42.560
clinic and we migrated their entire clinic over to LibreOffice.

48:42.560 --> 48:48.480
We went in and systematically removed Microsoft Office and switched them all over to LibreOffice.

48:48.480 --> 48:55.400
And along with LibreOffice, we had to move their database, their main medical database

48:55.400 --> 48:56.400
over.

48:56.400 --> 48:59.040
And it had been hosted on a seven-year-old server.

48:59.040 --> 49:05.720
And the problem was it was slowing down and it was starting to crash or actually just

49:05.720 --> 49:08.000
unexpectedly shut off.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.240
And they didn't have the $2,000 plus to purchase a new machine.

49:11.240 --> 49:15.080
And even if they did have the money, they didn't have an in-house IT staff, which would

49:15.080 --> 49:19.200
have meant that we would have been quoting out either a service contract to come out

49:19.200 --> 49:23.880
and replace hard disks when they fail or add memory when it goes off or bring up backup

49:23.880 --> 49:28.440
internet when the fiber line fails and all those good things.

49:28.440 --> 49:32.680
And we were actually able to solve all of their concerns for just $120 a year over at

49:32.680 --> 49:33.680
DigitalOcean.

49:33.680 --> 49:37.680
DigitalOcean, if you're not familiar with them, they're a VPS that does servers, Linux

49:37.680 --> 49:39.320
servers in fact, on demand.

49:39.320 --> 49:42.660
You might say it's like the McDonald's of fast food in the server world.

49:42.660 --> 49:46.020
We move dozens of businesses over to DigitalOcean.

49:46.020 --> 49:49.180
And just like when we move a business from Windows over to Linux or we move a business

49:49.180 --> 49:52.680
from Microsoft Office to LibreOffice, they never look back.

49:52.680 --> 49:56.820
In the two years that we've been moving people over to DigitalOcean, I don't think I've ever

49:56.820 --> 50:01.680
had a client that has told me they want to go back to buying servers and paying a yearly

50:01.680 --> 50:03.600
fee to maintain them.

50:03.600 --> 50:07.000
Their intuitive dashboard makes spinning up servers or as they call them droplets, super

50:07.000 --> 50:08.560
easy and efficient.

50:08.560 --> 50:14.040
At least once a week, I try to spin something up just to play with something.

50:14.040 --> 50:17.800
I try to start up a new droplet and try something new just to kind of keep myself fresh and

50:17.800 --> 50:20.700
kind of keep myself exploring.

50:20.700 --> 50:24.580
I don't have the time to install an operating system on a bare metal box.

50:24.580 --> 50:25.580
It just takes too much time.

50:25.580 --> 50:26.640
Now, I'll give you a pro tip.

50:26.640 --> 50:33.480
If you go over and spin up a DigitalOcean droplet and you use the code DOUNPLUGED, DOUNPLUGED,

50:33.480 --> 50:36.080
all one word, all lowercase, you're going to get a $10 credit.

50:36.080 --> 50:41.680
That basically means you get the servers that I use all the time for two months for free.

50:41.680 --> 50:47.140
That's a $5 droplet with a terabyte of transfer, a 20 gigabyte solid state drive, and 512 megabytes

50:47.140 --> 50:48.140
of RAM.

50:48.140 --> 50:52.080
If you know how to use Linux correctly, that gets you a long, long way.

50:52.080 --> 50:54.480
I have EMR databases running on it.

50:54.480 --> 50:55.960
I have a Mumble server running on it.

50:55.960 --> 50:58.520
I have an Airtime instance.

50:58.520 --> 51:00.300
I have my Quasocore running on it.

51:00.300 --> 51:05.360
I have the chat server that we were using back when we were doing the video portion

51:05.360 --> 51:06.600
of the Linux action show.

51:06.600 --> 51:10.360
All of that stuff was running on a $5 droplet.

51:10.360 --> 51:16.200
Head over to DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGED, DOUNPLUGED, all lowercase,

51:16.200 --> 51:23.200
all one word, and you'll get $10 credit to spin up your own Linux rig for two months.

51:23.200 --> 51:28.760
I want to move on and talk about the Ubuntu installer.

51:28.760 --> 51:37.880
Now things are changing in the Ubuntu installer, and the installer is called Ubiquity.

51:37.880 --> 51:39.880
Wes, have you seen this?

51:39.880 --> 51:43.520
Yeah, I've used it a couple of times.

51:43.520 --> 51:48.520
So they are changing the slide show, I understand.

51:48.520 --> 51:49.800
Have you read about this?

51:49.800 --> 51:52.560
I was just reading about it this morning, actually.

51:52.560 --> 51:59.880
So the one thing that I have noticed is the first time I install a new distro, or the

51:59.880 --> 52:05.700
first time I install what would be a new operating system, essentially, I'm paying attention

52:05.700 --> 52:06.700
to what's on the screen.

52:06.700 --> 52:09.120
I'm looking at how the UI elements are designed.

52:09.120 --> 52:14.240
I'm looking at the screencaps that they share and stuff like that.

52:14.240 --> 52:22.280
And I think it makes a lot of sense to update a lot of the stuff that's inside of the installer,

52:22.280 --> 52:26.640
because I think that's the first impression a lot of people are getting with Ubuntu.

52:26.640 --> 52:27.640
Would you agree?

52:27.640 --> 52:28.640
Oh, yeah.

52:28.640 --> 52:30.320
And that first impression is so important.

52:30.320 --> 52:34.040
You really need to lay it home that this is a modern operating system.

52:34.040 --> 52:37.880
It's uncompromising on all the kind of stuff that you would expect from it, that it's easy,

52:37.880 --> 52:40.800
that it welcomes you, and that it's going to create a really good experience, really,

52:40.800 --> 52:41.800
from the get-go.

52:41.800 --> 52:42.800
Yeah.

52:42.800 --> 52:50.960
So a couple of months ago, we were redoing Angela's MacBook, because we were selling

52:50.960 --> 52:57.680
it on eBay, and one of the things that I noticed about it was it plays a video when you start

52:57.680 --> 52:58.680
up macOS.

52:58.680 --> 53:02.120
This is really one of the few times I've ever used macOS, but of all the things I didn't

53:02.120 --> 53:05.280
like about the operating system experience, I thought that was kind of cool that it had

53:05.280 --> 53:08.280
like this welcome video, and it showed like the hello in a couple different languages

53:08.280 --> 53:09.280
and stuff like that.

53:09.280 --> 53:10.280
Oh, yeah.

53:10.280 --> 53:11.280
I'm familiar with that.

53:11.280 --> 53:12.280
Have you seen that?

53:12.280 --> 53:13.280
Yeah.

53:13.280 --> 53:14.280
It is pretty slick.

53:14.280 --> 53:15.840
It makes you feel like you're already using the computer, even though you haven't quite

53:15.840 --> 53:18.040
finished installing it yet.

53:18.040 --> 53:19.040
Yeah.

53:19.040 --> 53:20.200
So I thought that was kind of cool.

53:20.200 --> 53:23.680
But it was kind of like a welcome to your computer sort of a thing.

53:23.680 --> 53:24.680
Exactly.

53:24.680 --> 53:30.000
Since most of us are installing Linux, the installer and the images that come with the

53:30.000 --> 53:33.680
installer are what is greeting us to the operating system.

53:33.680 --> 53:40.480
And Chris had put some of the show notes together, so I'm not exactly sure.

53:40.480 --> 53:49.000
I'm a little confused on a few of the details here, but I think that the graphical interface

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
is really important.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
I think it's kind of cool.

53:51.000 --> 53:56.360
Popey, do you have anything to add about Ubiquity and feedback that you guys get from it?

53:56.360 --> 53:57.360
Yeah.

53:57.360 --> 53:58.760
So this was a surprise to me as well.

53:58.760 --> 54:05.560
So the design guys, they mostly work in London, in the London office at Canonical.

54:05.560 --> 54:11.360
And if you ever go into the London office, if you're ever lucky enough to go in there,

54:11.360 --> 54:12.880
there's post-it notes all over the walls.

54:12.880 --> 54:13.880
They're big on post-it notes.

54:13.880 --> 54:21.520
There's loads of prototypes, drawings, and mock-ups of user interfaces that may be in

54:21.520 --> 54:25.340
the future or might have been if we'd gone on a different path.

54:25.340 --> 54:29.720
And one of the things about the installer is, I'm not sure I agree with you.

54:29.720 --> 54:37.920
I think the installer, it may well be the first impression that people see of the distro.

54:37.920 --> 54:43.560
I believe that it shouldn't be because users shouldn't be installing Linux.

54:43.560 --> 54:47.240
They should be buying a machine that has Linux pre-installed.

54:47.240 --> 54:51.600
And therefore, they wouldn't see the install process because it would come pre-installed.

54:51.600 --> 54:52.600
That's what happens with Windows.

54:52.600 --> 54:55.440
Nobody cares about the install process of Windows.

54:55.440 --> 54:58.400
Nobody cares about the install process of OS 10.

54:58.400 --> 55:02.000
Most of the time, the users see the install process of Windows or normal users.

55:02.000 --> 55:07.160
I'm not talking about not your listenership, but your average Joe, most that they're going

55:07.160 --> 55:12.600
to see the installer is looking over the shoulder of someone else doing it, and they don't care.

55:12.600 --> 55:19.320
Or if they're being super techy and someone told them to reinstall because their machine's

55:19.320 --> 55:22.280
completely hosed and that's the only way out.

55:22.280 --> 55:28.280
I'm not sure that the installer is the best thing as the showcase.

55:28.280 --> 55:33.480
However, what you will notice in the blog post that is on design.canonical.com about

55:33.480 --> 55:38.440
why the first impression matters, you'll notice that the screens that they've talked about

55:38.440 --> 55:43.240
changing are the ones that you see after an OEM install.

55:43.240 --> 55:45.520
So it's not the full install.

55:45.520 --> 55:49.680
It's not like the partitioning scheme and all that kind of wacky stuff that you and

55:49.680 --> 55:52.600
I know all about and can skip through nice and happily.

55:52.600 --> 55:54.720
It's the stuff that an end user would see.

55:54.720 --> 55:59.400
And the stuff that an end user would see on first run is, okay, what language do you want?

55:59.400 --> 56:02.800
What Wi-Fi connection do you want to connect to?

56:02.800 --> 56:05.440
What time zone are you in?

56:05.440 --> 56:09.640
Do you want to set a password and do you want the system to lock and automatically unlock

56:09.640 --> 56:10.640
for you?

56:10.640 --> 56:11.640
That kind of thing.

56:11.640 --> 56:17.040
And so I find it interesting that actually that kind of corroborates my perspective that

56:17.040 --> 56:21.480
the first thing that we should be showing people is a great experience out of the box

56:21.480 --> 56:23.640
when you buy a machine.

56:23.640 --> 56:30.800
Now I would love to see a funky video, like you say, or something pretty that we can show

56:30.800 --> 56:34.480
a user when they first take their thing out of the box.

56:34.480 --> 56:39.760
Because let's face it, when people do unboxing videos, they love these things.

56:39.760 --> 56:47.040
When the Nokia N900 prototype phones or early adopter phones were sent out, they came in

56:47.040 --> 56:50.920
a special box that had special buttons and you had to send code over a serial cable.

56:50.920 --> 56:53.320
And when the box opened, smoke came out.

56:53.320 --> 56:54.320
It was amazing.

56:54.320 --> 56:59.440
So that unboxing experience, it should feel special to everyone.

56:59.440 --> 57:03.320
I'm not saying we should provide like smoke and stuff inside of it.

57:03.320 --> 57:04.320
Sounds hazardous.

57:04.320 --> 57:05.320
Every laptop.

57:05.320 --> 57:06.320
Yeah.

57:06.320 --> 57:07.320
And somewhat expensive.

57:07.320 --> 57:11.040
Intel did with the NUC, so you open it and it has a little Intel sound.

57:11.040 --> 57:12.040
Yeah.

57:12.040 --> 57:13.040
Oh, yeah.

57:13.040 --> 57:14.040
Yeah.

57:14.040 --> 57:18.600
See that and the Exploding Kittens card game that was on Kickstarter, that when you open

57:18.600 --> 57:23.280
the box, you hear, you know, beautiful things that you get when you take the thing out of

57:23.280 --> 57:25.520
the box means you cherish the thing a little bit more.

57:25.520 --> 57:31.040
And I think that's one of the factors why people who tend to buy Apple products cherish

57:31.040 --> 57:35.200
them a lot more is because of that whole out of the box experience.

57:35.200 --> 57:40.600
It means you want to love it even more, like, you know, going and picking a kitten up for

57:40.600 --> 57:43.920
the first time when you when you've like got a kitten from a rescue center or something,

57:43.920 --> 57:47.520
when you pick it up for the first time, you cherish it even more after that first meeting.

57:47.520 --> 57:48.520
Do you know what I mean?

57:48.520 --> 57:49.520
Right.

57:49.520 --> 57:50.520
Yes, absolutely.

57:50.520 --> 57:55.600
Especially if it, you know, sometimes, let's face it, some people's first introduction

57:55.600 --> 58:00.040
to Ubuntu or Linux in general is met after several hours of troubleshooting.

58:00.040 --> 58:01.480
Yes, very much so.

58:01.480 --> 58:02.480
Right.

58:02.480 --> 58:07.080
So the worst thing is it is because then then then it is tainted and the trust for the operating

58:07.080 --> 58:10.060
system is almost lost a little bit.

58:10.060 --> 58:14.680
So I definitely I agree with what you're saying.

58:14.680 --> 58:19.440
Even the issues like like the Apple thing is a good point, like because the Apple boxes,

58:19.440 --> 58:23.880
they will just they'll they'll keep the boxes and display them because of just the way they

58:23.880 --> 58:26.520
present the out of the box experience.

58:26.520 --> 58:31.280
You know, if there was something like that for the the UI or I don't know, before you

58:31.280 --> 58:36.720
install something like maybe they should put like the Ubuntu has the demo where you can

58:36.720 --> 58:40.600
just like use Ubuntu in the browser for a little bit and kind of experience it that

58:40.600 --> 58:41.600
way.

58:41.600 --> 58:43.640
If they put that more give more attention to that.

58:43.640 --> 58:49.320
Well, in fact, it's interesting you should say that in China, I think you do actually

58:49.320 --> 58:50.960
get that out of the box.

58:50.960 --> 58:56.640
There was a there was a government directive, I believe, that in China many years ago that

58:56.640 --> 59:01.320
was, you know, when you ship a machine, you have to provide some kind of tutorial out

59:01.320 --> 59:05.840
of the box, because a lot of the people who are buying these things are farmers out in

59:05.840 --> 59:06.840
the middle of nowhere.

59:06.840 --> 59:10.240
And they've had met, they've never bought a computing device before in their life.

59:10.240 --> 59:12.440
And they've got no idea what to do when you turn it on.

59:12.440 --> 59:16.080
And that and that's not unique to Ubuntu, you know, any computer, they turn it on, and

59:16.080 --> 59:19.880
they wouldn't know what to do in the same way that a farmer from the middle of America

59:19.880 --> 59:23.480
or middle of UK wouldn't know what to do if they never touched a computer before.

59:23.480 --> 59:28.760
But, and so we did used to put I don't know if we still do the the web based tutorial

59:28.760 --> 59:32.240
on machines that were shipping in China.

59:32.240 --> 59:38.000
And in fact, Dell, I think on the XPS 13, I don't have one, I've never bought one.

59:38.000 --> 59:42.120
But I'm led to believe there is a funky little video at the start of that.

59:42.120 --> 59:45.920
And I believe Dell made that we didn't, we didn't create that and it doesn't ship on

59:45.920 --> 59:46.920
the CD.

59:46.920 --> 59:50.440
It's not on anyone else's, like if you buy Lenovo, you don't get that video.

59:50.440 --> 59:56.000
So there is a, you know, move towards making that whole out of the box experience a little

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
bit better.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
Well, that's good.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
That's good to hear.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:05.240
Now, I have been automating my home for some time and joining us in the mumble room, we

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:06.800
have a very special guest.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.520
Ana is here.

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.520
Good afternoon, sir.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.520
How are you?

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.520
Good afternoon.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.520
I'm fine.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.520
Thank you.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:17.600
So tell me a little bit about CrowdStone.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:25.040
Yeah, so what we created here in Rotterdam, like one of the harbors in Europe, of course,

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:32.720
is a little device that you can plug into a power outlet, which is completely open source.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:39.160
So can be hacked by anyone who likes a little bit of like the firmware hacking.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:44.600
And what it does is actually two kind of things at the same time.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:48.680
Of course, you can dim lights and you can switch devices and things like that, like

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:51.040
the usable home automation stuff.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:57.040
But it also has proximity and indoor localization functionality.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:01.040
It does that by knowing how far your phone is.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:04.120
So it measures the distance to your phone.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:07.320
And at the same time, it also has device recognition on board.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:11.920
So if you plug in your TV or something else, it knows what the difference is between those

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.720
devices using the consumption pattern over the day.

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:17.720
Wow.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:18.720
Wow.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.720
That's crazy.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.840
It can identify the device, huh?

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:22.840
Absolutely.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:23.840
Yeah.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.800
So we use multiple ways to do that.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:31.760
So one of the simple ways is actually just using the power consumption itself, of course.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.780
But you can also see the pattern over time.

01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:36.040
My background is robotics.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:41.600
So I use a lot of algorithms we have been developing over the time.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:50.480
And so if you use a collection of reclassifiers, they can use all kind of features, for example,

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.480
temporal features or other kind of features.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:54.540
You can collect them.

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:59.840
And collectively, they are able to distinguish a lot of devices.

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.760
And there is a third way you can use.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:08.720
And that is, say, every device leaves a kind of a signature on the grid.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:17.360
So if you plug in a LED led light, you will have some signature that is different from

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.200
if you plug in a normal light bulb.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.800
You can use that on a single sine wave.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:27.080
You can already see what the difference is between certain devices.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:34.160
Now, I understand that this device can actually recognize a certain form of rudimentary logic.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.160
So for example, if my TV, I don't unplug it.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.380
It just sits in the living room and stays there.

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:43.880
So if I were to unplug my TV, that would be a bit unusual.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:48.080
How does your device respond?

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.080
If you, yeah.

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:53.620
So these are the kind of events we want to be able to register.

01:02:53.620 --> 01:03:00.360
So if you would unplug your TV at night, it's probably kind of events you want to receive

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:06.260
as the owner of the building or of the home or the apartment.

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:13.320
If it's your microwave that gets plugged out, you probably don't need to know it.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:16.480
Tell me a little bit about how the child lock feature works.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:21.240
How does it know if there are adults in proximity or not know if adults are in proximity?

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.120
Oh, yeah.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.040
That was a nice feature.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:33.480
I was actually, we had a group of 50 students that were working on our product, under covers

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.360
to say, in Rotterdam.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:40.840
And one of those groups were coming up with this feature that was first like, yeah, but

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:44.400
I don't want to have children carrying phones with them.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.760
But it was the other way around.

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:50.880
So it was really parents that are walking around.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:57.040
And when they are in proximity, certain devices can be turned on.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:00.280
When they are not, they are not turned on.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:05.800
And the proximity detection is just by using the Bluetooth low energy signal strengths

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.640
that are already on your phone.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:15.840
So basically by measuring kind of, say, between three or five meters, something like that,

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.160
it should be on.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:21.080
If it's beyond that, it should be off.

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:24.000
Now I understand that we're kind of in early days here.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.720
In fact, you have a Kickstarter over at crownstone.rocks.

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:28.720
Is that correct?

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:29.720
Yeah.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:33.160
So if you go there, yeah, you will automatically can go.

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:37.200
You will have one go button and you can go down to the Kickstarter.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:42.720
Tell me at some point, will there be a way that I can integrate this inside of the box?

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.680
Because I know one of the things I'm seeing right off the top of my head is I would be

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:51.800
perfectly okay with this, my wife, however, is not going to appreciate a protruding object

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.060
from the outlet.

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:57.360
If this project takes off, maybe an iteration two or three, would there be a way that we

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:02.760
can get this so it actually replaces the wall outlet itself?

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:06.800
There is one version that you can actually put behind the power outlet.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:14.960
So yeah, so you should have enough space, of course, there is a little bit of space

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:22.920
required in your junction box, but yeah, then for your wife or so, nothing changes.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:31.320
She can just turn on and off the lights and you can basically rule it over kind of by

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:36.280
doing it wirelessly and then she will be like, oh, it's not going on, but she will probably

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:42.120
flip it another time and then for her, not so much changes, she can still use the physical

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.120
switch.

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.120
Wow, that sounds fantastic.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:48.440
Now, you said that all of this was designed with open source in mind.

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.680
Tell me how I can interface to this device.

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:56.100
I get the little plug, I assume there's some way that I can program it to tell it, I want

01:05:56.100 --> 01:06:00.320
you to act as a child locker, I want you to act as a motion detector, I want you to act

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.320
in this way or the other.

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.960
How do I go about actually programming the device?

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:10.640
Yeah, we decided to actually put a lot of logic onto the smartphone.

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:17.600
So first of all, we have open firmware, so you can do everything on the device itself

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:26.040
if you want to, but that is a better device, so it's difficult to program for certain people.

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:33.640
It has 16 kilobytes of RAM, it's like the radio takes up 10 kilobytes, so it's very,

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.680
very little space you have on a device like that.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:41.160
You won't be able to run JavaScript or something.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:48.920
So our Bluetooth of Energy interface basically is an API that people can use from whatever

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:56.840
kind of device they have, a laptop with Python scripts or Raspberry Pi or things like that.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:02.760
But the main advantage is also that we provide libraries on the smartphone, different ones,

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:09.120
so Cordova-based and iOS and Android-based, so they can actually write applications like

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:18.040
they normally do for smartphone apps and they can directly interface with those brownstones

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.040
from their phones.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:28.800
Yeah, what's also different from normal or different Kickstarters, quite often they stream

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:33.320
everything to a server like, for example, the Fitbit or something like that.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:40.320
You cannot actually get your own data out except for it via a REST API online.

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:44.520
We decided to do it directly on your phone, so you really can get your own data.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:49.280
You don't need to go through a company server or something like that.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.280
Oh, that's awesome.

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.760
So there's no centrally activated server.

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:56.240
See, that would be my first line that would rule me out of your product, because if you

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.920
told me, well, there's a little serial number and you have to go to our website and activate

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:03.600
it and then use our web portal to program it and stuff like that, but you're telling

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:07.320
me basically if I really wanted to, if I got needy and gritty, I could actually plug in

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:12.360
with like a serial cable and program this thing with my laptop.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:20.440
Yeah, we will also add a pledge for developer edition with separate connectors, but at the

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:23.800
moment you will need to do it over the air.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:28.880
So we have Bluetooth low end, yeah, so we have the MQ, yeah.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:33.200
How does the over the air programming work if I want to do it directly on the device?

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:39.040
You spoke about being able to do that or the two mutually exclusive?

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:49.360
No, so via wires you need connectors on it, but the default is that you can do it wirelessly

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:56.600
and you can do it via say a standard application that's already on the market or you can do

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:03.240
it actually also via shell scripts, Python scripts.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:08.040
Now there's a lot of home automation type equipment that is already prevalent in the

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.040
market.

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:13.400
So for example, universal remote controls or URC, they have templates on how to talk

01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:18.160
to other devices either via TCP IP or over RF.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.360
I assume because it's an open standard, that should be a pretty simplistic thing that should

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:28.000
be a pretty rudimentary thing for me to tie your device into my remote control, is that

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
right?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.040
Yeah, absolutely.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:35.520
Any kind of hub that exists that has Bluetooth low energy and it doesn't even need to have

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:41.680
that because there are a lot of switch like little dongles available for only a few bucks.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:46.040
And then yeah, it's very basic to hook up to other stuff, absolutely.

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:50.480
Wes, do you have any questions about this smart socket?

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:54.640
I'm just really impressed with how open it appears.

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.200
A lot of the other platforms that we're seeing in this kind of space are so closed off.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:02.160
A lot of them, if you download the SDK, you have to sign an agreement that you won't use

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:06.000
it to create interoperability with other products.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.160
So the idea here that you could take something that you've already bought or maybe someone

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:14.040
you're installing this for already has some sunk costs and then just create something

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:19.000
to bridge it and take advantage of this is awesome and I think it's one of the best things

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
going for it.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Yeah, absolutely.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.760
The fact that it's open really appeals to me.

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:24.760
How about our mumble room?

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.360
Do you guys have any questions, comments, concerns?

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:33.640
Yeah, if your laptop has Bluetooth, for example, can you use your laptop to interface with

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:34.640
the device?

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.640
Yeah, absolutely.

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:40.480
Your laptop is fine as well.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.920
I'm only using Linux, so I don't know how it works on Windows, but he knows how to get

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.920
our interest.

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.920
Yeah, no kidding, man.

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.600
You just earned yourself 10 character points.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.960
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:59.600
And as a hobby, I have been actually backing a lot of Kickstarter projects and most often,

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:03.120
if I cannot get to the data, I try to do it myself.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:11.920
So with the FitBit or the Mimoto camera thing or whatever, but I find it a pain that they

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.760
make it so closed.

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.200
So that's why we really wanted to make this product so open.

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.280
It really shows.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.920
That's great.

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:25.920
You really probably should check out that video where we go through the house and go

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.200
through how everything works.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:32.020
One of the things I demoed is my scene selector in my house where I can hit the bedtime mode

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:35.140
and it turns all the lights down so I can kind of wind down at night.

01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:37.920
One of the things I've done is I used to watch TV.

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:43.400
I actually got back into Walker, Texas Ranger, the show from the 90s, and I liked that show

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:44.400
because it was light.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.400
So I could watch it.

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:49.400
I could wind down for a little bit and I would go to bed, is take for contrast 24.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:53.900
If you watch an episode of 24, you have to watch what happens to Jack in the next episode.

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:57.280
And so what ends up happening is it's like seven in the morning and you're like, oh crap,

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:00.640
I didn't sleep all night because I sat up all night watching 24.

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:05.160
Really I have been winding down with a new hobby and that is I'm learning how to develop

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.200
apps on Android.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.200
Very cool.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.200
Yeah, I know.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.200
I know.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.200
But here's the thing.

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.200
I know what some people are saying.

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.080
The chat room is about to freak out and the mobile room is about to freak out and say,

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.080
no, you're not.

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.080
You're not a, you're not a dev.

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.080
You're a sysadmin.

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.080
And I know that.

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.080
Okay.

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.080
I know that.

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:24.540
But with a 33% discount over at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, I can't think of a more cost

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.640
effective way to relax at night.

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:31.760
And I've had a blast being able to go through those modules and you know, I'm, I'm a little

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:34.680
bit ADD if you haven't picked up on that yet, Wes.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:39.120
And so I zone out every once in a while, like if I'm listening to somebody talk and I try,

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.180
I mean like bless my wife's heart.

01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:42.760
She is so good at putting up with this show.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.920
She'll start talking to me and I have every intention of listening to all the words that

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:49.960
come out of her mouth and then like three minutes into it or five minutes into it.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:54.100
I just, I like, I fade off and I just, I go into la la land and then then it's lost.

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:59.380
And with, with Linux Academy, I can go back and rewatch some of that stuff that I missed.

01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:05.240
And Wes, I got to tell you, when I first got into IT, I remember how expensive things were,

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:08.440
how expensive things were to get trained, how expensive things were to get certified.

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.440
Yeah.

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.440
It's a huge roadblock.

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:13.160
If you're trying, you know, you're just trying to get started out in this industry.

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.160
It really is.

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:18.720
It really is because you're competing with a bunch of people that, that, that are on

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:19.720
a different playing field.

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:22.220
They're essentially on a different level than you are.

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:25.960
And you can do that for pennies on the dollar over at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.360
Do you know what opportunity cost is?

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:35.920
Opportunity cost is the price that you pay for not getting that job because you didn't

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.880
have the training and you didn't have the certification because you're not at linuxacademy.com

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:45.160
slash unplugged taking advantage of literally a third of the cost reduction.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:49.360
And you know, the cost isn't even all that expensive to begin with, even at full price.

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:53.120
I think with the, I think with the discount, I think my whole month of training for Android

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.160
worked out to be like 15 bucks or 16 bucks.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:56.160
Oh man.

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.160
That's nothing.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.160
Yeah.

01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.160
Yeah.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.160
It really isn't.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.160
It's really cheap.

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.440
And even without the discount, it was only like 25 bucks, I think.

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:07.040
So I mean, this is the way, if you, if you're listening to the show and you're listening

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.000
and saying, you know, I really want to do what Noah does.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.400
I really like the idea that Noah doesn't, doesn't ever have to troubleshoot Microsoft

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.400
windows.

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.640
I mean, I just don't do that.

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:21.640
If you want to get yourself a career started with, um, in Linux or using open source and

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:24.360
related technologies, this is the way to do it first.

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:27.960
You have to get current with the technologies and there's no better way to do that by taking

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:30.720
a professional online course.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:34.660
You know, you can do the YouTube thing where people were, you know, Joe Blow in his basement

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:38.880
makes a little video with a handicapped, um, and you hear his baby sister crying in the

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:42.540
background and his mother calling him up for dinner and the dogs barking.

01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:47.200
You can do all that, but don't spend a couple of dollars and get yourself some professional

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:50.160
training and, uh, and then get certified.

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:54.240
And they, uh, they offer, they, they really, really, uh, do a good job with someone like

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.240
the red hat certification.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.040
So that's a great certification.

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:00.880
I know that anytime I have somebody that sits down in my office and, and, and when the,

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:04.800
when their resume slides across my desk and if I see that red hat cert, man, that cert

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.360
means something to me because I know that they have practical skills.

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:15.720
Uh, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, take advantage of that 33% discount while you can

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:20.400
over at ZD article that is looking, uh, at open Seuss leap.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:24.280
Have you seen this West, you know, only just a little bit.

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:30.440
So the, the current stable release of open Seuss is 13.2 and that came out on November

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:31.440
4th of 2014.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:36.880
Um, the next release is scheduled to be available November 4th, November, uh, excuse me, November

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.440
4th of 2015, exactly one year later.

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:45.360
Um, and the new release will not be called 13.3 or 14 dot, you know, whatever, but rather

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:50.160
it's going to be called 42 dot one, 42 dot one.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:55.060
And so appropriately they're codenaming this leap.

01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:58.280
The reason for the name slash number change and the extra attention that this release

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:03.560
is getting is that they are making a philosophical change in the development and release strategy.

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:08.240
The reasons for this change and the results of it are discussed on the open Seuss leap

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:09.240
Wiki page.

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:13.480
A lot of the discussion has been focused on open Seuss getting merged with Seuss Linux,

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:18.260
enterprise Linux, but I think it's important to note, this is the author speaking on me,

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:22.320
but I think it's important to note that this is more of a two way street than it is.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:28.560
In fact, as it is explained in the Wiki, what happened, which what enabled the merge was

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:34.040
that SLE sources and maintained updates have been released to the open Seuss build service.

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:42.000
Now, um, in theory, this is ideally what I, as a Linux desktop user have been waiting

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:49.480
for a commercial enterprise Linux distro that is centered around the Linux desktop.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:56.320
Um, I, I seem to be stuck on, on two sides.

01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.400
Either I get bleeding edge and things aren't really ready for enterprise and I have problems

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:06.060
or I wind up with really, really old outdated packages and there doesn't seem to be a middle

01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:10.920
ground and that seems to be what they're aiming to solve here.

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:14.120
And I got to say their, their, their desktop experience in the past has been really good.

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.480
So this, this gives me a lot of hope.

01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:19.680
Uh, you know, open Seuss in the past has been one of those distros that I know I can just

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:23.680
install on someone's machine and they will have all the resources there that they need

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:27.320
to use it and to explore and to, you know, in the same way that they could use windows

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:31.560
that they'll be able to solve all the problems and make all the changes they might need.

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:35.520
You know, Wes, I don't know if you've noticed this either, but when I move people over from,

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:40.920
uh, from windows to Linux, a lot of times, um, for whatever reason, they are very comfortable

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:46.640
in open Seuss as opposed to a lot of the other, uh, a lot of the other alternative distros

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:47.800
out there.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:52.280
And I haven't exactly been able to put my, my finger on why that is.

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:57.240
If that, if that, I, I suspect it has a lot to do with KDE, to be honest with you, I think

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:00.840
that windows users kind of gravitate towards having a bar at the bottom where they click

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.280
on a button that gives them a menu.

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.280
Yeah.

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.480
I think, I think there is something there.

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:05.480
And yes.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.480
Yes.

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:07.480
Goes a ways too.

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:08.480
Yeah.

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:10.720
And so I think that, uh, yas goes a long ways.

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:15.560
Yeah, man, does it ever, especially if you are a, a former windows administrator.

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.360
I think that's going to go a long ways.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:24.520
Um, but I'm looking at, uh, I'm looking at this open Sue sleep and the screen caps that

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:27.280
I'm looking at are absolutely awesome.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:33.200
I am really looking forward to taking a look at some of this and, and playing with this.

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.240
In fact, I have so much so that I've actually dedicated an entire machine to this and it's

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.680
going to be my main machine for the rest of the week.

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:44.480
And I'm going to take a look and see, um, what it is that, that open Seuss is offering

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:49.440
and see if it appeals to me because like I said on paper as I'm reading it, this is what

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:50.440
I have been waiting for.

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:54.500
I mean, quite honestly, I guess I've kind of been waiting for red hat to do it simply

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:59.160
because then I would have, um, you know, it would be like this nice, easy transition.

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.160
Right.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.160
It's your home turf already.

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.160
Right.

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:03.160
Right.

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:04.560
And then since I'm already administrating red hat servers and I just, it would make

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:08.840
kind of nice, but this seems like they are, you know, they're really cracking down and

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:09.840
aiming.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:10.840
I am their target audience.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:14.760
They're like, I am the person that this is, is reading that this is written for.

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:19.520
And it also seems like they're also targeting, uh, arm guys, which is really, really encouraging

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:24.440
because you're seeing those arm devices becoming more and more prevalent and lower and lower

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:25.440
costs.

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:28.040
Um, and I think that's a big deal.

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.040
That's a huge deal.

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.040
You know, it goes, it goes with the whole, the whole Linux way.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:36.000
If you can get a cheap, easy processor and you know that Linux will just run on it and,

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.120
and open Seuss has got that huge build service.

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:42.200
So you know that they are ready to, to build any open source software that can be for your

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.200
platform.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:46.080
Then, you know, you can, you can build the whole solution on that.

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.080
Yeah.

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:48.080
That's the promise.

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.080
Have you used the open build service?

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.080
Yeah.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.560
You know, I, I think it's great.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:54.840
I've used it to find, um, supported packages.

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:57.680
I've used it when I'm using open Seuss and then as well, you know, it seems to support

01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:58.960
other distributions as well.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.240
Uh, random projects that use it to supply, you know, to build different packages for

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:03.240
all kinds of things.

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.240
Yeah.

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:10.160
So it builds for, uh, Ubuntu Debs, Debian Debs, uh, RPMs for both Seuss and Fedora and

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:11.160
Magia.

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:14.560
And it also builds for arch packages and a couple other things as well.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:15.560
Yeah.

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:16.560
I love that arch package integration.

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:17.560
That's, that's just great.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:18.560
Yeah.

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:22.080
I've actually, uh, the only, the only thing is, is that it has a custom spec file you

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:26.320
have to learn how to use, but so basically you build a script using their spec file and

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:30.560
then it will upload your source to their servers and they build out everything for you.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.000
It's, it's pretty awesome.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.880
And I wish more people would use it.

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:37.480
You say it's actually better than I think, uh, via Tumbleweed, could you expand on that

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.480
a little bit?

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:39.480
Yeah.

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:43.040
And what I was saying is that, uh, people are thinking that it's, it's, it's more like

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:48.360
a workstation thing, but it's actually a more cohesive sharing structure of what they're

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.360
going for.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:55.120
So like they're having, uh, SLE has released all of their stuff for the OBS so that the

01:20:55.120 --> 01:21:02.160
open Seuss can have, they can spend less time on open Seuss stable or, you know, the regular

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:05.560
version and more time on Tumbleweed.

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:10.720
And because of this, Seuss has like a deal sort of thing struck structured where open

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:16.440
Seuss, uh, base is going to be based on SLE.

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.000
Then open Seuss is going to do extra stuff on top of that to do, uh, you know, more up

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.520
to date packages and provide a more user experience for the average user.

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:29.980
But they're also doing Tumbleweed and Tumbleweed is the rolling release, like the arch thing.

01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:34.640
And in certain cases, um, you know, people always talk about how arch gets things faster,

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.200
but Tumbleweed actually is getting stuff faster.

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:43.280
I haven't tested for 318, but no, they got known 316 in before arch did and like staple

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:44.560
and running and everything.

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.760
And they're doing, they're doing things like that are really impressive in this sense.

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:54.120
But another cool thing is that Tumbleweed is going to be the base for SLE in the future.

01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:59.380
So every three years or so, Tumbleweed is going to be like snapshotted and then that

01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:05.700
becomes SLE, which then comes back into the, you know, the, the, the workstation type structure

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:07.760
for open Seuss for leap.

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:14.080
So you'd get a Tumbleweed snap snapshot, then you get a SLE, then you take SLE stuff, put

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:20.780
it into a leap again, and then it keeps this, you know, a whole cycling structure of open

01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:21.780
Seuss.

01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:26.440
Like just everything is shared between the enterprise version and the workstation and

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:27.680
the rolling.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:35.300
So in certain cases, like for example, every year SLE does like a service pack that will

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:39.560
also be instituted into the leap packages.

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:46.680
So you even get a yearly update as well as just, you know, the whole, you know, stuff

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.680
sitting on top of it.

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:53.360
You're not getting just open Seuss editing things and giving you more up-to-date packages.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:59.240
You're also getting Suse enterprise updates as well as the open Suse updates and the Tumbleweed

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.240
updates.

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:05.800
That sounds various, like, like a leaner, meaner, Debian plus enterprise backend and

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.320
kind of the best of all worlds.

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:08.320
That's impressive.

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.320
It does.

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:11.800
It sounds like not only is it the best of all worlds, it sounds like somebody is sitting

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:15.480
there going, what does Noah want as a Linux distro?

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:16.700
And then that's what they're making.

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:18.160
You don't think those people exist, Noah?

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.160
Come on.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.160
Yeah.

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:21.160
I'd like to believe that they do.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:26.800
I mean, on the, the, I just, I have a, I am comfortable in, in a multitude of different

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.800
Linux distros.

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:28.800
I am comfortable on Centos.

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:29.800
I'm comfortable on Ubuntu.

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.800
I'm comfortable on Fedora.

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:31.800
I'm comfortable on Arch.

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:38.040
Suse and open Suse is maybe the one, one of the, one of the few main distros that I haven't

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.740
used extensively.

01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:43.360
And this article is really making me reconsider that like big time.

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.440
I'm downloading the ISO at home right now.

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.440
Yeah.

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.440
There's actually something you should check out.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:52.880
Another thing that's going to, a lot of people don't even know about it, but it's open Suse

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:54.640
have built the open RA system.

01:23:54.640 --> 01:24:01.960
So it's like a automated testing structure and it's, that's the, I just put the link

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.260
in the chat room.

01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:08.160
This is a cool thing because they're, they're tested, they're not only just doing leap testing,

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:12.220
they're doing tumbleweed testing with this, they're doing, they're, they're working on

01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:14.440
sleet testing as well.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:18.400
And the coolest thing is that if you look at a test, I'm going to send you a link for

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:19.680
that too.

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:23.760
If you look at one of the tests, it will go through the process of automating it and then

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:29.000
it shows you a screenshot of every single test and whether it passed or not.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.780
And this is a beta one, so there are a couple of fails, but this is one of the beta builds.

01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:39.320
So and it goes through like the entire installation process, the entire setting up Gnome, the

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:43.640
running Gnome, testing different applications in Gnome, and it gives you this full automated

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:47.040
testing thing and it shows you where it works and where it doesn't.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:52.900
And if that wasn't cool enough, they actually made a video version of it.

01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:55.200
So every single test has a video attached to it.

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:59.560
You can watch the test just run.

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:00.560
That seems awesome.

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:02.960
It really does.

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:05.400
I'm going to have to, I'm more of a hands-on learner.

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:09.720
So I'm following 90% of what you're saying, but I think to really get the full scale of

01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:12.060
it, what I'm going to have to do is play with it.

01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:17.840
And so like I said, I actually have a laptop that is dedicated to trying all this out as

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.720
soon as I get home tonight.

01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:24.400
And so I'm going to be playing with it the rest of the week and I'll have to report back

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.720
in and tell you what you think.

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:28.080
And Wes, you said you're considering doing the same, huh?

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.080
Yeah.

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.080
You know, I've been looking for a replacement.

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:34.720
I've been using Linux Mint on my work workstation, mostly because that was one of the provided

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:37.020
images when I was hired.

01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:41.520
But it's feeling a little, you know, I've got the distro hop and itch like many of us

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:42.520
do.

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:45.200
So I think this will be a great thing to try out and see if I can use it as my day-to-day

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:46.200
at work.

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:47.200
Yeah.

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:55.040
Anyone else in the mumble room have any thoughts on the OpenSUSE situation, story, release?

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.040
Anyone else going to try it?

01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:58.440
I mean, I'm already trying it.

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:01.120
I've got one machine running, Tumbleweed.

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:04.960
And I haven't tried Leap yet, but I do plan on trying Leap as well.

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:08.840
But Tumbleweed is just impressive.

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:15.240
And especially with OBS in conjunction with Tumbleweed, you get, like, it's not really

01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:21.480
like a PBA, it's not an alternative to PBA, it's not like an exact same thing, but it

01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:25.340
is very similar and you get a lot of packages up to date as well.

01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:28.420
So it's a really good experience.

01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:33.920
So you should try both if you're interested in just seeing what they're, what SUSE is

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:36.720
doing with all this and OpenSUSE is doing.

01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:39.360
It is really cool.

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:44.600
And another cool thing is that they have turned, like, you should look at their installer.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:49.600
Like their installer is nice, looks great, and it's all in Curses.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.040
Oh, really?

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.040
I love in Curses.

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:53.040
That's awesome.

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.040
Yeah.

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:57.840
It looks like a real, like a regular installer, like a GUI installer, and it is presented

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:02.120
like a GUI, but it is all through in Curses and it's all, like, I'm pretty sure it's all

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:03.680
based on Yast.

01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:05.560
So it's like Yast is handling it all.

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:11.640
It is really slick and it is also, like, super fast and lightweight when it runs.

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:18.800
And like, it's kind of like, it's kind of so cool, it's hard to actually describe it.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:21.680
So I'm so excited what SUSE is doing.

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:22.680
Yeah.

01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:23.680
It is rubbing off.

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:24.680
Sure is.

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:25.680
Yeah.

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:28.080
And so I'm going to have to try it and report back.

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:31.560
And like I said, it's a little bit hard to conceptualize all this stuff, especially because

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:37.440
a lot of these services, associated services with open SUSE, you know, don't mean a lot

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:39.680
to me because I haven't really used it a whole lot.

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:46.440
I tried to implement it one time in a commercial setting and I ran into, the first little problem

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:49.600
I ran into, I'm not even necessarily blaming open SUSE, it was just, it was a dumb little

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:53.360
problem that I had and I just said, just went to Ubuntu.

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:56.400
And that was probably a little unfair and in hindsight, maybe that was a little foolish

01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:01.120
and short-sighted, but I'm going to give it a real world and report back.

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:04.000
Now I have a request from the community and from everyone else.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.440
We are looking for Runs Linux.

01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:10.320
We are looking for really cool and unique Runs Linux.

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:14.400
We are looking for a picture or a video of something that runs Linux.

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:17.800
We see the things that like in restaurants and stuff and that's super cool.

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:19.840
And if you see those, please send those in.

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:24.080
But if you have something unique, especially if you are part of a project like the guy

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:25.560
that wrote in that did the school bell.

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:26.560
Oh, I love that one.

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.560
Yeah.

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.560
Wasn't that cool?

01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:29.560
Super cool.

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:32.200
I mean, that, that is, that combines everything that is cool.

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:33.360
It combines open hardware.

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:34.480
It combines open software.

01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:38.240
It combines a maker and you put education, education.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.840
You get all this stuff together and you get something really cool out of it.

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.120
I know that you guys are out there.

01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:46.120
I know that you guys that are doing cool Runs Linux people, I know you guys are out there.

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:51.360
So I want you to upload a video to YouTube or submit a link via the subreddit or email

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:55.240
Linux action show at jupyterbroadcasting.com or go to jupyterbroadcasting.com.

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:58.460
Click on the contact link and choose Linux action show from the dropdown menu and let

01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:00.160
us know about your Runs Linux.

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:02.560
We really, really want to hear it.

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:08.360
Also, the network is, could really use your support, um, patreon.com slash today.

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:14.280
I want to make a plea with you guys, um, to think about, uh, supporting the network.

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:18.240
If you're not supporting the network, I know that, um, you know, there's, there's a, there's

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:24.320
a wide variety of, of opinions, um, on, on, um, on, on the current show lineup and the

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.120
current way that we're doing the shows.

01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:31.840
Um, but the way I have always looked at contributing to the network was I pay my cable bill and

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:36.520
I pay $80, $90 and, um, I'd flipped through the channels and some of the shows I liked

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:40.320
and some of the shows I didn't like and some of the episodes of the shows I liked and some

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:42.480
of the episodes, the shows I didn't like.

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:47.020
And at the end of the day, I still paid my cable bill, um, because it was a flat fee

01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:53.680
and right now the network is, is in need of you guys to, to, to step up and help out.

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:59.400
So if, if you can afford it, um, we would really appreciate your support, patreon.com

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:00.400
slash today.

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:02.640
If you like the content, if you like what you're hearing, and I assume you do, if you're

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:07.840
listening to the episode, um, uh, throw the network a couple of dollars, every dollar

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:10.920
goes a long, long way and we would really appreciate it.

01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:16.400
And if you get to swag level, uh, sponsorship, I just have to tell you, I, I feel like it's

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:17.400
Christmas.

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:20.960
The other day, Angela sent me this really cool, um, like, uh, like Jupiter broadcasting

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:21.960
pin.

01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:23.600
Oh, I'm jealous already.

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:28.560
I know it's so like, I like ding dong, the door rings and I go up to the door and here's

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:29.560
the mail guy.

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:30.560
And I'm like, but I didn't order a package.

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:32.460
I did not spend any of my hard earned money.

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:33.460
Why am I getting this?

01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:36.760
And I rip it open and then there's like, there's a little, there's a, there's a little treat

01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:41.240
in there and I've gotten, I've gotten mouse pads and I've gotten coffee mugs and there's,

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:42.240
there's all sorts of things.

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:46.020
And I don't know, you know, I see sometimes some of the cool stuff that they're thinking

01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:48.680
of sending out or, or trying to work out sending out.

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:49.920
It just, it's a cool thing to do.

01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:53.080
So if you can get to swag level supportership, that's something that's in the budget for

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.080
you.

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:55.080
I highly recommend it.

01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:56.080
It's super, super fun.

01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:59.960
And it's really rewarding to know that for literally half the cost of what it would cost

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:04.560
you for direct TV or half the cost of what it would cost you for cable TV, you're supporting

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:10.740
a, uh, you know, you're supporting a, a small, a small business plus all that product for

01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:11.740
Chris's hair.

01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:12.740
It just doesn't buy itself.

01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:13.740
No kidding.

01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:14.740
Right.

01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:16.120
Pay for that as a community.

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:17.120
He does.

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:19.320
And, and he, and you know, even living in the RV.

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:20.520
I was a little worried.

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:23.860
I was a little worried, Wes, when he showed up and he was talking about like doing the

01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:24.860
dry shampoo.

01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:26.600
I'm like, what if, what if all his hair fell out?

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:27.600
And like, he's the network.

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.600
It depends.

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:31.280
I know it is, is, it's a huge deal.

01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:33.680
And so when he stepped out of the camper for the first time, like I was holding my breath

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:37.040
and I'm like, and I knock and then he opens the door and there's her master Chris.

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.280
And it looked amazing.

01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:39.280
Yeah.

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.280
Looked amazing.

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:44.960
So patron.com slash today really, really, really would appreciate it.

01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:48.540
If we could get, uh, if we could get some supporters, let's do this, let's, let's open

01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:54.240
this up in a browser and let's look, let's see, um, let's see what we can accomplish

01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:55.240
as a team.

01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:57.820
How many, how many patrons does he have right now?

01:31:57.820 --> 01:31:59.900
Right now he has 554.

01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:01.700
Let's see if we can just get to 560.

01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:02.700
But I like round numbers.

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:05.420
Do you ever, do you ever do that thing where you go to the gas station and he scored a

01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:09.660
little bit of gas into the car and, uh, and you, you, you have to bump it up to the next

01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:11.460
dollar just so it's a nice even amount.

01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:12.960
It's like a fun little game.

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:13.960
I know.

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:14.960
Yeah.

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:15.960
So let's see if we can get it to exactly 560.

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:19.500
And, and so, and so Chris wakes up and goes, oh, that's kind of cool.

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:24.140
Look at what, look at what my, look what the podcast based on the community was able to

01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:25.140
accomplish.

01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:26.140
I think that would be super cool.

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:27.140
Agreed.

01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:30.100
And you know, I always look forward to the next, the next program, you know, it's something,

01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:33.960
it's something that I kind of define my week with is, is JB, is JB podcasts.

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:38.260
And I know a lot of you guys do too, so it really doesn't take very much to, to keep

01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:39.260
Chris going.

01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:41.300
No, no, it really doesn't.

01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:44.420
And it, like I said, every dollar goes a long, long way.

01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:46.780
Also join us Friday for the Linux action show.

01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:49.860
And I can't tell you what we're going to talk about.

01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:50.860
Top secret.

01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:51.860
Yeah.

01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:55.300
But I can tell you that in order to pull it off, we are going to need some Coca Cola, some

01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:58.620
beef jerky, a blanket, a USB drive.

01:32:58.620 --> 01:33:01.740
And I gave Chris a dedicated laptop before he left Grand Forks.

01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:05.100
So make sure you tune in and you can see what we have planned.

01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.860
It's going to be absolutely awesome.

01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:09.860
And you can use your imagination and see what you can come up with.

01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:12.700
Wes, is there anything you want to say before we get out of here?

01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:15.540
No, just that it's been a pleasure co-hosting with you Noah.

01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:16.860
Yeah, I really appreciate it.

01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:17.860
We should do this more often.

01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:18.860
I really think we should.

01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:19.860
Who needs Chris anyway?

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:20.860
Yeah.

01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:21.860
Why I need Chris.

01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:22.860
Oh wait, nevermind.

01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:27.820
But he can, but he can go on vacation every once in a while and enjoy himself and uh,

01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:29.020
and we can hang out.

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:33.380
That brings us to the end of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:36.840
We should be at our usual time next week, over to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:38.260
to keep an eye on that.

01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:40.380
Chris may change a couple of things while he's on the road.

01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:44.420

01:33:56.660 --> 01:33:59.740
Thank you so much for tuning into this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:04.180
A special thank you to our producer, Michael Tennell, and our mumble team.

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:28.580
We'll see you right back here, next week.

01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:40.220
That's a wrap.

01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:41.220
Great show, everyone.

01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:42.220
Individually.

01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:46.820
It's such a pleasure having all these wonderful people.

01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:47.820
Oops.

01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:48.820
I hit the wrong button, Wes.

01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:49.820
I hit the wrong button.

01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:50.820
Uh-oh.

01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:51.820
Uh-oh.

01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:52.820
And so then I couldn't hear your voice in my ear hole.

01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:53.820
Ah.

01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:55.180
What will you do without my beautiful voice, Noah?

01:34:55.180 --> 01:34:56.180
I know.

01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:57.180
I know.

01:34:57.180 --> 01:34:58.180
All right.

01:34:58.180 --> 01:34:59.180
Now it's time to go to jbtitles.com.

01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:00.180
Jbtitles.

01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:02.180
I think I get to pick the title today.

01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:03.180
I think I do.

01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:04.180
You're not.

01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:05.180
Yeah.

01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:06.180
Oh.

01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:07.180
Yeah.

01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:08.180
I know.

01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:09.180
I know.

01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:10.180
We're in trouble, gang.

01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:11.180
That makes me sad when I see things like a title that says, Who Needs Chris?

01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:12.180
That's so sad.

01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:13.180
I would miss the hair vest.

01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:15.460
I would start crying if I didn't hear from him for a week.

01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:16.460
I think it would cry.

01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:18.540
It would make me sad.

01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:19.540
Open source power outlets.

01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:20.540
That's not bad.

01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:21.540
Um.

01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:22.540
Um.

01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:23.540
Um.

01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:24.540
Um.

01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:25.540
Um.

01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:26.540
End user dilemma.

01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:27.540
Oh, man.

01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:28.540
We don't have many.

01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:29.540
You know what?

01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:32.620
Now I know why Chris says bang suggest all the way throughout the episode.

01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:33.620
Now I know.

01:35:33.620 --> 01:35:35.180
You gotta goad the audience.

01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:36.180
Yeah.

01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:40.180
If you don't, you get 12 title suggestions.

01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:42.180
And who doesn't want to say bang suggest?

01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:46.380
Who doesn't want to say bang suggest?

01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:51.580
I think we could have a lot of fun with God mode.

01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:55.580
This is Noah in God mode.

01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:59.380
Bang suggest inside of the chat room to come up with excellent titles that we can vote

01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:07.780
at JBtitles.com ultimate Linux podcast in a world where no one has submitted a title.

01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:13.100
Why does every single advertisement for a movie always start with in a world?

01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:14.540
Like we don't live in other worlds.

01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:16.400
We all live in the same world.

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:19.020
Maybe that's the the fantasy draw.

01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:20.020
Maybe.

01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:21.480
All right.

01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:22.680
We need titles, guys.

01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:23.680
We need time.

01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:24.680
It's a.

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:27.340
Oh, we got multi universe type thing.

01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:32.060
Noah in God mode, open source power, open source, your power outlets, open source, your

01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:34.500
power outlets isn't bad, especially because it's close.

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:35.500
Yeah.

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:41.100
So do we like open source power outlets or open source, your power outlets?

01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:43.100
Maybe not your just because it's shorter.

01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:44.100
OK.

01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:45.100
All right.

01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:49.220
So open source power outlets is winning by seven votes.

01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:50.820
All by four votes, total seven.

01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:54.260
I mean, either one, I think are great.

01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:57.980
Not the same just because I did them, but not anyone.

01:36:57.980 --> 01:37:02.460
Unbiased rotten as always.

01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:03.460
Protect the beard.

01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:09.100
I was focusing more on moving you guys around than anything else.

01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:10.100
Thank you.

01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:11.100
Yes, thank you very much.

01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:17.100
I really, really, really appreciate it, because the way that the setup is, if I if I if I if

01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:20.280
somebody were to talk to the Mumble Room, I would reach over and mute the Mumble Room,

01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:23.600
but then that would mute West and there's no way for me to separate West unless you

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:27.580
put us into our own separate.

01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:28.580
Our own separate channel.

01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:29.580
Don't worry.

01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:30.580
We got this.

01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:31.580
Yeah.

01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:32.580
You guys are amazing.

01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:33.580
Just just amazing.

01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:35.980
Did you like my thank you to you rotten corpse at the end?

01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:38.980
Yeah, that was fantastic.

01:37:38.980 --> 01:37:39.980
So.

01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:40.980
All right.

01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:41.980
Open source power outlets is the winner.

01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:47.100
Yeah, I declare it as a winner because it has to be because it has the most votes out

01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:48.100
of everything.

01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:49.100
Oh, you know what?

01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:50.100
I'm not going to say it.

01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:51.100
I'll say it.

01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:53.700
I won't say it right now.

01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:54.700
Okay.

01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:55.700
What are we going to talk about for a post show?

01:37:55.700 --> 01:38:01.660
We're going to talk about the open QA dot open source dot or open source dot org.

01:38:01.660 --> 01:38:05.500
But yeah, I know that we've got there already.

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:08.460
I didn't know that was a photo impressions there.

01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:09.780
Oh, yeah.

01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:11.420
No, it doesn't matter.

01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:12.420
There's tons of things to talk about.

01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:15.420
What else should we talk about, guys?

01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:18.860
To you, Mumble.

01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:22.140
Hey, thanks for the meetup shout out.

01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:23.140
Yeah.

01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:24.140
Thank you so much.

01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:25.140
All right.

01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:26.140
Let's talk.

01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:27.140
Well, I guess I was kind of the pre-show topic.

01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:30.340
But yeah, thank you so much for making the making the time to be at the meetup.

01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:36.060
I, you know, it'd be really cool to get up and do that every once in a while.

01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:37.060
I think that should be a thing.

01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:38.060
Do, do, do.

01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:39.060
Yeah.

01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:43.860
And since I assume Chris isn't going to hear this part, I'm not going to break it to him

01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:47.820
that they spelled my name wrong, but.

01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:48.820
They spelled your name wrong?

01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:49.820
Oh, yeah.

01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:52.140
I had the Rover Rambler.

01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:56.300
I didn't I didn't leave a card that since my name is Reed with an I.

01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:57.300
Oh.

01:38:57.300 --> 01:38:58.300
OK.

01:38:58.300 --> 01:38:59.300
It'll be our secret.

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:00.300
It's not like it's going out over the air or anything.

01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:04.140
So nobody will ever know.

01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:08.980
So there's there's one thing this is more of an interesting topic or less, but it's

01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:09.980
not really.

01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:13.620
I guess it's perfect for post-show, I guess.

01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:19.420
But there's a there's some new stuff with the like the Devils Canyon stuff and the new

01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:24.620
hardware stuff for running.

01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:27.180
Hard like running virtualization pass through.

01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:31.660
So you have the hardware, hardware acceleration and everything in a virtual machine.

01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:38.340
So you could use something like KVM or you could use a bird manager or whatever.

01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:40.580
And I think even VirtualBox has this.

01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:46.540
So you can play Windows games inside of a virtual machine with your hardware and everything.

01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:49.500
So it feels like a full.

01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:54.580
You know, you have a full machine, you basically have, you know, everything you absolutely

01:39:54.580 --> 01:39:55.580
need.

01:39:55.580 --> 01:40:00.780
And even like 60 frames per second games and stuff running now, are they using KVM pass

01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:01.780
through for that?

01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:07.100
Yeah, there's KVM pass through and well, it's PCI pass through, but you basically get access

01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:10.940
to your graphics card and you get the full processor ability.

01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:12.700
So it limits like your main host.

01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:15.220
But if you're playing a game, it doesn't matter.

01:40:15.220 --> 01:40:19.100
But it gives you like the full access to all of your hardware.

01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:25.280
And only like the latest like from Haswell and newer has these like these features like

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:26.440
pretty solid.

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:29.980
But you need to have like a motherboard and the processor needs to support it.

01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:30.980
Both need to support it.

01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:31.980
Otherwise, it won't work.

01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:32.980
What is it?

01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:33.980
Intel?

01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:34.980
Is it BTD?

01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:35.980
Is the name of the?

01:40:35.980 --> 01:40:36.980
Yeah, I think so.

01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:37.980
Yes, BTD.

01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:42.100
I've always had this crazy idea that I could have like one physical machine that sits in

01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:48.020
my basement and then have like four video cards and then a KVM switch so I could KVM

01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:52.980
through my different computers, but they're all physically one machine.

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:58.500
I don't know how realistic that is, but I dream or maybe not to definitely possibly

01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:01.300
three or might be a little bit over the time.

01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:02.300
Don't push your luck, Noah.

01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:06.960
You know, separation is so nice, like even things for different tasks.

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:10.700
The amount of times that I have thanked myself for having a separate video production computer

01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:11.700
than everything else.

01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:15.780
It's not because video production is so like it's not like I can multitask doing video

01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:16.780
production.

01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:20.420
Either I'm editing video or I'm not, but the mere fact that it's on a separate machine

01:41:20.420 --> 01:41:23.580
means that I can slide my chair over, get a little bit of work done, and if I have to

01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:26.680
do something else, I go to a different machine to do it.

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:30.100
Not only am I not interrupting my workflow, but I don't wind up with extra junk on my

01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:34.540
machine like I don't wind up with Thunderbird with misconfigured email accounts because

01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:37.580
the password changed, but I hadn't opened it in a year or so that, you know, just didn't

01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:38.580
work or something like that.

01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:44.500
And I don't wind up with, you know, weird files and my huge long list of Firefox bookmarks

01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:46.000
on my video editing machine.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.820
All I have is resources for editing videos.

01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:51.860
And as we know in your life, everything changes pretty much all the time.

01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:55.980
So it's probably essential to have some a little firewall where you can say this is

01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:59.780
the purpose and it stays that way and I change it only when needed.

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:02.300
Wes, I call it an ADD firewall.

01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:03.300
Perfect.

01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:07.660
It's a firewall for my ADD and it helps me separate things out into separate machines.

01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:09.380
You have a toy machine over there.

01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:11.340
Don't install that package yet.

01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:13.340
That's the one with the shiny stuff on it.

01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:14.340
Exactly.

01:42:14.340 --> 01:42:19.980
But yeah, so that has been where I have found that's been hugely helpful to be able to compartmentalize

01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:24.440
stuff and if I could, that's a promise, it's very, very expensive to buy different machines

01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:26.020
to do multiple different things.

01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:30.420
Yeah, boy, the number of computers you have, that's right, brings a tear to my eye.

01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:31.420
Yeah.

01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:38.940
So you need a KVM switch with a keyboard and mouse shut off so it limits the access to

01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:39.940
that machine.

01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:47.100
Well, if I had, so if I could pass through, so the KVM switch will give me four USB connectors,

01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:48.100
right?

01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:49.100
And four video connectors.

01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:55.700
And so I could plug all four video, I could plug all four KVM connectors into the computer

01:42:55.700 --> 01:43:00.460
and I'm hoping there would be a way that I could tell it this USB plug is only passed

01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:03.300
through to this computer and this one is only passed through to this computer.

01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:09.380
And I don't know, I might end up having to use separate like little PCI, you know, cards

01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:13.060
with a separate USB controller, huh, to be able to get that to work.

01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:18.340
Oh, you know what, I just saw somebody on YouTube that did this, was that Logitech has,

01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:24.940
what the heck they call it, it's the mouse that has like multiple Bluetooth dongles and

01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:28.780
a switch on the bottom of the mouse that you can go back and forth.

01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:30.420
Oh, that is awesome.

01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:36.140
And like, you know, it's intended to be, you know, you can plug, you can pair with two

01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:43.980
different computers, but if you plug the USB dongle into the same computer and then pair

01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:49.940
the USB port that the dongle is plugged into your KVM, then, you know, you've got the same

01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:54.900
mouse that's paired with two different machines on the same physical host.

01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:55.900
It's like a hardware synergy.

01:43:55.900 --> 01:43:58.100
You know what's funny?

01:43:58.100 --> 01:43:59.740
You took the words right out of my mouth.

01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:00.740
Those are my words now.

01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:01.740
Yeah.

01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:02.740
Yeah.

01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:05.220
That's what I was, that's right about what I was going to say was it's like what I look

01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:09.620
for with synergy and except not in synergy.

01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:10.620
Well that'll be really cool.

01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:11.700
I will have to keep an eye on that.

01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:14.660
It's something that, it's something that I really think I could put into practice.

01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:18.860
Again, it's, I'm going to run up against that problem of, since I have a working solution,

01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:22.280
I'm going to have to pry myself away.

01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:28.060
Anything else anyone wants to add into the post show before we get out of here?

01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:33.500
Well the reason I brought up the hardware thing is because it creates a potential discussion

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:40.940
topic of when Linux adoption is something that's really hard to do right now, you know,

01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:45.620
for a, you know, forever basically because trying to convince them about a certain application

01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:46.620
blah blah.

01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:55.920
Do you think it would be better and that Linux would be more likely to kind of take over

01:44:55.920 --> 01:45:03.100
the world if, you know, there was pre-packaged applications that you could just run and like

01:45:03.100 --> 01:45:05.900
instead of having to see, oh, does it support it?

01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:06.900
Doesn't matter.

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:08.220
Your virtual machine has an app.

01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:11.580
We have an instead of a wine wrapper, we have a virtual machine wrapper and all you do is

01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:14.140
install this and there you go.

01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:21.420
I've done that on a basic scale for my parents before where I had a Windows application listening

01:45:21.420 --> 01:45:25.460
for a file at startup and I would have a shortcut on the Linux desktop for like, you know, when

01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:30.540
my mom, for instance, would need to use Microsoft Office for a certain document, you know, once

01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:34.820
in a while that she could pass it, open it up just like a regular application, it would

01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:38.780
open the virtual machine, the virtual machine would know to open Word.

01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:41.700
So I think there's something there.

01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:45.720
Long term solution maybe not but it could be a really good, you know, a wrapper for

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:50.420
someone who wants to transition but still requires a certain amount of Windows specific.

01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:55.460
You know, I keep coming back to, I really hope I'm not wrong on this but I'm really

01:45:55.460 --> 01:46:00.500
hoping that as we move forward, that web centric applications begin to take more dominance

01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:05.660
and as that happens, the need for a compatibility layer just kind of drops.

01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:07.140
I mean, hopefully.

01:46:07.140 --> 01:46:11.220
Yeah, but the web layer can't really work with the hardware that well.

01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:12.500
Yeah, that's true.

01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:14.260
Something has to talk to the hardware, you're right.

01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:18.940
So there's certain things like, I don't know, it's kind of like the web apps have like,

01:46:18.940 --> 01:46:25.100
I use web apps a lot and they're great in certain cases and they're awful in other cases.

01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:32.140
So like stuff like WebGL are making that a lot better but I think that there's, you know,

01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:34.660
I don't want web apps to become the norm.

01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:39.020
I would like them to become a novelty that it's a very highly used novelty.

01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:40.100
Yep, yep.

01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:43.020
I'm right there with you Rottencorpz, I really am.

01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:47.740
I have seen web apps, I have always looked at them as a necessary evil.

01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:51.580
I would prefer that my software run locally but if I have my choice between running the

01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:57.220
software on Linux in a web browser or running Windows software only, if I have to pick between

01:46:57.220 --> 01:46:59.740
those two, I'll take the web software every time.

01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:02.860
Yeah, I would agree with that.

01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:06.700
Windows users migrate to web software, Linux will keep our awesome desktop applications.

01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:07.700
Yeah, exactly.

01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:21.020
See, now we're on the money, we can agree on that.
