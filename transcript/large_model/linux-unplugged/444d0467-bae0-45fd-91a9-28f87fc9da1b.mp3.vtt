WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.920
So, this is the XFCE perspective, and this is why, even though I give Joe a hard time,

00:06.920 --> 00:15.240
I get it, because I worked at a place when I was in high school, and I came back, and

00:15.240 --> 00:19.480
I'm not, I'm almost positive, it may have been nine years, but I think it was almost

00:19.480 --> 00:21.280
ten years on the nose.

00:21.280 --> 00:27.960
I came back, and I shit you not, one of the same Dell workstations that we set up with

00:27.960 --> 00:33.800
Debian and XFCE to administer the servers was still in the IT department.

00:33.800 --> 00:39.120
It had been dist-upgraded a couple of times, it was still running XFCE, it was still that

00:39.120 --> 00:45.080
original install on that same original hardware, it had just been upgraded, and it was the

00:45.080 --> 00:48.000
identical XFCE desktop it was when I left.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.800
The terminal, everything was exactly the same.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.800
Stable as a rock.

00:51.800 --> 00:57.680
And you look at that and you go, holy shit, that is something, that is ten years of consistency.

00:57.680 --> 01:01.240
I doubt it would hold up anymore, but at that time, when I saw that, this was many years

01:01.240 --> 01:06.620
ago now, I was blown away by that, I was like, damn, that's not something we get on modern

01:06.620 --> 01:09.360
computers anymore, that's just not how computers work anymore, they don't build them like they

01:09.360 --> 01:10.360
used to.

01:10.360 --> 01:16.640
Chris, if I tell you that I have probably the same configuration for my E17 desktop

01:16.640 --> 01:19.760
I had about ten years ago, no change.

01:19.760 --> 01:20.760
Really?

01:20.760 --> 01:22.640
And it works, no problem.

01:22.640 --> 01:27.280
Do you attribute that to, what do you attribute that to?

01:27.280 --> 01:33.960
Desktop environment, hardware choices at the time, distro, what do you attribute that to?

01:33.960 --> 01:39.840
The E17 manager came with the composite manager years ago.

01:39.840 --> 01:40.840
It was early.

01:40.840 --> 01:41.840
Before all the others.

01:41.840 --> 01:42.840
Yeah.

01:42.840 --> 01:43.840
Very early.

01:43.840 --> 01:44.840
Right.

01:44.840 --> 01:49.080
And once you had your configuration, and that configuration stayed stable, so it's E17,

01:49.080 --> 01:51.880
now it's E22, it's just an involvement.

01:51.880 --> 01:56.160
In the background they changed a lot, but the configuration stays the same, so I can

01:56.160 --> 01:58.640
use the same configuration as before.

01:58.640 --> 01:59.640
That is nice.

01:59.640 --> 02:05.520
I do really, thank you, because I don't really have a lot of experience with E17, so that's

02:05.520 --> 02:09.000
a good perspective, but Wes, we must get this show on the road.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.340
There's Linux to discuss.

02:10.340 --> 02:14.020
There is much to talk about, so with that, let's get going.

02:14.020 --> 02:18.680
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 242.

02:18.680 --> 02:24.480
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's got so much to discuss, from

02:24.480 --> 02:28.880
birthdays to new features and new distros, that we've got to get right into it.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.880
My name is Chris.

02:29.880 --> 02:30.880
My name is Wes.

02:30.880 --> 02:31.880
Hello, Wes.

02:31.880 --> 02:34.960
I'd say it's super good to be with you and all that stuff, but I've actually been hanging

02:34.960 --> 02:35.960
out with you all day.

02:35.960 --> 02:36.960
That is true.

02:36.960 --> 02:38.920
So it's just been nice hanging out with you today.

02:38.920 --> 02:41.320
We had some Chinese food, we got the dogs in studio.

02:41.320 --> 02:43.840
Now we're in the perfect mood for today's Unplugged.

02:43.840 --> 02:44.840
Totally, totally.

02:44.840 --> 02:47.200
In fact, we've got something really fun coming up.

02:47.200 --> 02:51.320
We're going to take a look at the new Slack's 9.4.

02:51.320 --> 02:52.320
You know about Slack's.

02:52.320 --> 02:57.600
It used to be based on Slackware, now it's based on Debian, and they've got some really

02:57.600 --> 03:04.160
cool features and, well, maybe might just be the perfect distro for you secret agents.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.160
I'll tell you about that coming up.

03:06.160 --> 03:10.040
Then we're going to get into some new, brand new spanking features we're rolling out here

03:10.040 --> 03:14.960
on the Unplugged program, podcast updates, everybody, and then not one, not two, but

03:14.960 --> 03:22.880
three updates to this story about Google blocking G apps on uncertified devices.

03:22.880 --> 03:25.520
Is your custom ROM doomed?

03:25.520 --> 03:27.560
Stay tuned and find out.

03:27.560 --> 03:32.360
Microsoft has some new open source, and after you hear about what it is, it'll be like,

03:32.360 --> 03:33.360
how come they didn't do that sooner?

03:33.360 --> 03:34.360
Yeah.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.320
I thought they were all about the open source.

03:36.320 --> 03:40.040
Then a new Wayland contender enters the field.

03:40.040 --> 03:44.400
We'll tell you about that, how people are creating their own open source Tesla wall

03:44.400 --> 03:45.400
replacement.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.400
You know those Tesla batteries?

03:46.400 --> 03:47.400
Yeah.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.400
Fancy.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.400
Yeah.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.360
In fact, I'm going to propose we could combine two different open source initiatives, one

03:51.360 --> 03:56.360
that Joe and I talked about, and this initiative to really make something special.

03:56.360 --> 04:00.040
Then we got a couple of app picks, and then, yeah, like I said, we'll get to slacks, which

04:00.040 --> 04:01.040
is super cool.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.440
I got it running on my machine right here, right now.

04:03.440 --> 04:04.440
I love it.

04:04.440 --> 04:07.440
But before we go any further, we've got to bring in our virtual log.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.240
Time appropriate greetings, Mama Roo.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.240
What's up?

04:10.240 --> 04:11.240
Hello.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.240
Hello.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.240
Get it out of here.

04:13.240 --> 04:17.680
A rare Joe Rez appearance in the virtual log this week.

04:17.680 --> 04:18.680
That's great.

04:18.680 --> 04:19.720
It's good to see you, everybody.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.320
Thank you for being here.

04:22.320 --> 04:26.680
Did you guys notice, you probably did, but I thought it's worth mentioning here on the

04:26.680 --> 04:29.720
show, Red Hat turned 25 yesterday.

04:29.720 --> 04:37.320
So that means 1993, and Red Hat points out that that was pre-dot-com boom, pre-mobile,

04:37.320 --> 04:43.960
pre-cloud computing, pre-big data, pre-DevOps and containers, and Red Hat has been through

04:43.960 --> 04:46.480
it the whole time.

04:46.480 --> 04:52.480
And at first, I was like, oh, that's cute, but then you think about it, like, shit, that's

04:52.480 --> 04:54.680
a lot of stuff to have to respond to.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.080
Those are a lot of big trends.

04:56.080 --> 05:00.240
The dot-com boom is alone like a make it or break it, right?

05:00.240 --> 05:01.240
Absolutely.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.360
Like a lot of companies died.

05:02.360 --> 05:09.560
And then cloud computing and mobile and all of that, instead of it making Red Hat irrelevant,

05:09.560 --> 05:14.600
they managed each time to sort of turn and meet the new challenge.

05:14.600 --> 05:24.120
And now on their fricking 25th birthday, they're damn near worth $2 billion.

05:24.120 --> 05:28.200
Because the market has been has been sort of flushing out for so long and establishing,

05:28.200 --> 05:32.560
it's like the next few years are going to be some of the most critical, I think.

05:32.560 --> 05:39.200
Because there's a lot of really valuable real estate, and Red Hat isn't necessarily the

05:39.200 --> 05:40.760
best position to take advantage of it.

05:40.760 --> 05:45.120
I'm thinking about AWS, and I'm thinking about Azure, and I'm thinking about Rackspace.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.240
Ubuntu is about 70%.

05:47.240 --> 05:51.880
And if I'm Red Hat, I'm looking at that going, we've got to get some of that market.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.340
We've got to get some of that market.

05:53.340 --> 06:00.320
And so I wouldn't be surprised if 2018 isn't going to be a really aggressive year for Red

06:00.320 --> 06:01.320
Hat, especially 2019.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.320
25 years.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.320
That's a lot of stuff.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.320
It is.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.320
That's a lot of stuff.

06:05.320 --> 06:09.080
And you know, they got the Red Hat Summit coming up in San Fran.

06:09.080 --> 06:12.760
Tempted to go, tempted to email them and say, hey, what do you think about me going to Red

06:12.760 --> 06:13.760
Hat Summit?

06:13.760 --> 06:15.400
It's in San Fran.

06:15.400 --> 06:19.640
I've decided after scale that pretty much anything south of San Francisco is no good.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.800
I don't know, have you been to California before?

06:21.800 --> 06:22.800
Yes, I have.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.440
I think you're about, have you ever noticed it just gets really brown and smoggy after

06:26.440 --> 06:27.440
San Francisco?

06:27.440 --> 06:30.000
I mean, I'm going to go to Pasadena and scale, and I love it down there.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
You guys are great.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.960
But really, everything after San Francisco is just no good.

06:33.960 --> 06:34.960
Don't tell them.

06:34.960 --> 06:35.960
They'll come up to Washington.

06:35.960 --> 06:36.960
That's what they're doing.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.040
I know.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.040
You joke.

06:39.040 --> 06:43.880
But that's actually like a local controversy is that all these damn Californians keep coming

06:43.880 --> 06:44.880
up to our Washington.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.400
Not that we don't love you, dear California listeners.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.880
Yeah, no, we love the listeners.

06:49.880 --> 06:50.880
We love the listeners.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.680
It's just their damn roads that we hate.

06:52.680 --> 06:57.400
The Red Hat Summit is in San Francisco on May 8th to the 10th.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.120
I mean, I'm certainly glad Red Hat's around.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.240
It would be more boring otherwise.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.240
Go ahead.

07:02.240 --> 07:03.240
Yeah, I would.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.240
Yeah, go ahead, Joe.

07:04.240 --> 07:09.080
Yeah, I was going to say, you talked about like AWS and stuff and how Ubuntu is massive

07:09.080 --> 07:14.280
on those platforms, but how much revenue is that actually bringing into them?

07:14.280 --> 07:19.480
If you've ever got RHEL running on them, then Red Hat are making money, whereas most people

07:19.480 --> 07:26.440
running Ubuntu on AWS or wherever aren't necessarily paying for support.

07:26.440 --> 07:31.800
It doesn't really matter how much market penetration Ubuntu has got.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.440
It all boils down to dollars and cents, doesn't it?

07:34.440 --> 07:35.440
That's a fair point.

07:35.440 --> 07:40.320
Yeah, not every AWS or Azure installation is necessarily translating to a support contract

07:40.320 --> 07:41.320
with Canonical.

07:41.320 --> 07:45.320
And there's a lot of T2 micros out there running Ubuntu and probably some RHEL machines in

07:45.320 --> 07:47.360
the GovCloud doing real work.

07:47.360 --> 07:51.160
There's lots of dot-com heroes who can swoop in and help you with your Ubuntu box, too,

07:51.160 --> 07:53.320
so you don't have to go get that contract.

07:53.320 --> 07:58.200
But I would submit you, Joe, there's still headwinds for Red Hat, too, because, take

07:58.200 --> 08:04.680
AWS again, and just after I've begun, and I think you know what I'm talking about, Wes,

08:04.680 --> 08:09.840
after I've begun to understand the scale of AWS recently, it almost doesn't matter what

08:09.840 --> 08:11.640
all the other guys are doing.

08:11.640 --> 08:17.200
AWS in itself is so large that if only they do something, it moves the whole industry.

08:17.200 --> 08:21.360
The scale is in terms and numbers, it is hard for us to understand.

08:21.360 --> 08:24.700
But Wes and I recently got a better understanding of it.

08:24.700 --> 08:29.620
And the thing you got to consider with Red Hat is not only are they kind of behind already

08:29.620 --> 08:33.960
in that space, but then you've got Amazon Linux, which we've talked about before.

08:33.960 --> 08:38.800
And Amazon Linux is based on Red Hat, and it's supported by Amazon directly, and it's

08:38.800 --> 08:43.060
part of their image gallery, and it's one-click deployment for Amazon Linux, which is essentially

08:43.060 --> 08:46.120
kind of like sent to us, don't call it Red Hat.

08:46.120 --> 08:50.960
And like if I'm on AWS, maybe that's what I deploy instead of Red Hat, you know?

08:50.960 --> 08:55.000
So like now Red Hat not only has to compete against Canonical, but they've got to compete

08:55.000 --> 09:02.960
against AWS's own home-brewed Linux, which is really just RHEL.

09:02.960 --> 09:03.960
That's-

09:03.960 --> 09:04.960
But isn't that just the startups?

09:04.960 --> 09:09.720
Isn't that just the people who can't afford RHEL proper who are going to go for Amazon

09:09.720 --> 09:15.000
Linux, but then the big companies who can actually afford to pay for the support contracts

09:15.000 --> 09:17.480
are going to keep paying for RHEL, and-

09:17.480 --> 09:18.480
I think so.

09:18.480 --> 09:24.160
That's why RHEL have continued, you know, Red Hat have continued to be this huge company

09:24.160 --> 09:30.000
who are now pushing, you talked about 2 billion, they're pushing 3 billion at this point.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Yeah.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.960
Yeah, I think you're probably right that if, you know, anybody that's going to have serious

09:33.960 --> 09:37.480
infrastructure that's going to be making a lot of money, you know, like think about your

09:37.480 --> 09:41.560
Facebooks and your YouTubes and your, anybody that's going to be rolling serious infrastructure

09:41.560 --> 09:44.400
is going to have a support contract, and they're going to go with Red Hat.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.400
Yeah.

09:45.400 --> 09:46.400
Yeah.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.400
Red Hat's doing good.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.080
Their stock's up today.

09:49.080 --> 09:52.440
It's been a little all over the place, but 25 years is pretty respectable.

09:52.440 --> 09:53.440
Yeah.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.880
I mean, they're obviously thinking about these new things too with their, you know, acquisition

09:55.880 --> 09:56.880
of CoreOS and-

09:56.880 --> 09:57.880
Yes.

09:57.880 --> 09:58.880
It's similar.

09:58.880 --> 09:59.880
We'll see if it bears fruit.

09:59.880 --> 10:05.960
Speaking of that, the whole, and so yeah, their big quote unquote Kubernetes play, right?

10:05.960 --> 10:07.280
That's all about the future.

10:07.280 --> 10:13.200
That's all about orchestration of lots of, lots of, lots of systems, which is, boy, that's

10:13.200 --> 10:14.680
going to be fascinating to watch.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.680
All right, Wes.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.840
Well, we're not the only ones.

10:17.840 --> 10:19.840
Red Hat, you got out there, you got us out there.

10:19.840 --> 10:20.840
We're making changes.

10:20.840 --> 10:21.840
Everybody's making big improvements.

10:21.840 --> 10:22.840
It's spring.

10:22.840 --> 10:23.840
It's the time for that.

10:23.840 --> 10:24.840
Yeah.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.720
It's the season of change, and we have some nice improvements coming to the Unplugged

10:27.720 --> 10:30.360
program that I want to tell you guys about, and a little bit of a heads up.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.760
So last week I said, you're going to see some changes.

10:32.760 --> 10:35.600
You're going to see some feed changes, all that kind of stuff.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.000
Well, here we are this week.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
It's arrived.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.200
We've got linuxunplugged.com, which is a nice companion to linuxactionnews.com.

10:43.200 --> 10:50.500
So we've got linuxactionnews.com and linuxunplugged.com, dedicated site and a resource for this show,

10:50.500 --> 10:54.240
and it will be sort of the canonical destination, I guess I'd say, if you will.

10:54.240 --> 10:55.240
Is that, can we say that?

10:55.240 --> 10:56.240
Is that fair?

10:56.240 --> 10:57.240
You're allowed.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.240
Okay.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.240
This time.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.240
Yeah.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.240
Yeah.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.240
All right.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.240
Good.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.240
And so, for example, like say you wanted to get the links for something we talked about.

11:04.240 --> 11:07.780
You go to linuxunplugged.com slash 242 or 241, for example, and you get all the links

11:07.780 --> 11:09.040
for the stuff we talked about.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.040
You want the RSS feed?

11:10.040 --> 11:11.040
We got that too.

11:11.040 --> 11:16.360
You go to linuxunplugged.com slash RSS or if you want links to your favorite podcast catcher,

11:16.360 --> 11:18.240
it's linuxunplugged.com slash subscribe.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.240
Are you getting it?

11:19.240 --> 11:20.240
Yeah.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.240
It's clean.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.240
It's simple.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.240
It looks easy.

11:23.240 --> 11:24.240
Yeah.

11:24.240 --> 11:25.240
Yeah.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.520
New dedicated feeds, new dedicated site, and we're rolling out chapter markers to the

11:26.520 --> 11:27.520
MP3 feed.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.520
Started last week.

11:28.520 --> 11:33.520
So you'll see them if you have a, like a Pocketcast or Overcast or IEM that support.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.800
One of the fancy clients.

11:34.800 --> 11:35.800
Yeah.

11:35.800 --> 11:36.800
Or desktop player.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.200
I believe that VLC can do it.

11:38.200 --> 11:41.360
I believe it's possible to accomplish that in VLC, Wes.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.360
Beautiful.

11:42.360 --> 11:43.360
I believe, Wes.

11:43.360 --> 11:44.360
I believe.

11:44.360 --> 11:45.720
You can check that out though.

11:45.720 --> 11:46.720
Linuxunplugged.com.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.360
As you go there, then go grab the RSS feed.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.920
Make sure you've got the right feed, linuxunplugged.com slash RSS.

11:52.920 --> 11:53.920
New stuff.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.060
Chapter markers I think are going to be pretty popular.

11:56.060 --> 11:57.960
People love them across all the other shows.

11:57.960 --> 12:01.640
I soft launched them last week and already got a bunch of people saying they liked them.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.160
So check out linuxunplugged.com.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.640
Check out the new podcast feed now.

12:05.640 --> 12:06.640
That's it.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.400
There's going to be other changes coming.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.640
Now some of these changes, none of you are going to care about.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.960
You're going to be like, Chris, I don't even know why you're spending time on this.

12:12.960 --> 12:16.200
And some of you are going to want to come to the studio and punch me in the face.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.120
So it's a difficult position I find myself in.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.120
You know what I'm saying?

12:19.120 --> 12:20.120
Difficult position.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.120
I sure do.

12:21.120 --> 12:27.600
Rekai's last week was, basically last week, he's still technically here, but we're trying

12:27.600 --> 12:33.240
to like transition everything and get it all done and do everything before he's gone, right?

12:33.240 --> 12:34.720
Like try to be proactive.

12:34.720 --> 12:40.080
He gave his notice at the beginning of the month and we now have all the equipment, we're

12:40.080 --> 12:43.000
doing the editing, I'm editing the shows.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.840
And as part of that, I am making some damn changes because I'll tell you what, I don't

12:47.840 --> 12:50.600
got another full time job in me.

12:50.600 --> 12:54.360
And I can't be editing the video for this show.

12:54.360 --> 12:55.360
I can't be doing it.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.560
And we can't have you just falling over in exhaustion because then everything shuts down.

12:58.560 --> 13:02.640
So we're going to make some changes, but I actually think people might like them.

13:02.640 --> 13:06.400
So I'm going to be publishing a couple of different things for a little bit just to

13:06.400 --> 13:10.360
experiment to see what the audience likes because none of this stuff is hard set.

13:10.360 --> 13:15.400
But if you watch the video version of the unplugged program, there will probably be

13:15.400 --> 13:17.520
two versions initially is what I'm thinking.

13:17.520 --> 13:23.620
We're going to have the live version that will go on a new YouTube channel.

13:23.620 --> 13:27.300
And then we'll have an edited version, which will go on the main Jupiter broadcasting channel,

13:27.300 --> 13:29.240
the podcast version.

13:29.240 --> 13:34.660
The primary release will be the MP3 feed at linuxunplugged.com.

13:34.660 --> 13:38.480
We'll generate a video for that at the Jupiter broadcasting YouTube channel.

13:38.480 --> 13:43.020
And then we have a JB live YouTube channel that we'll be setting up that will be the

13:43.020 --> 13:48.000
complete live stream unedited full video version of the show.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.440
I don't know if that's going to be how it is for say the next six months.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.160
I don't know if it's going to be how it is for a month.

13:53.160 --> 13:57.640
That's just how we're trying it right now as I'm trying out different stuff.

13:57.640 --> 13:59.240
So that's kind of in the works.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.400
So you'll see us experimenting with the video version.

14:01.400 --> 14:07.440
If you watch that, I got to be honest with you, thousands of more, I mean, tens of thousands

14:07.440 --> 14:11.000
of more people download the audio version than watch the video version.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.240
So that's where my attention has to go because I've got to do this show.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.240
I've got to do all the other shows.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.560
I've got to edit all the other shows.

14:18.560 --> 14:19.960
Well, except for land.

14:19.960 --> 14:20.960
Joe's editing land.

14:20.960 --> 14:21.960
Thank God.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.960
Yeah, I was going to say.

14:24.960 --> 14:25.960
Jeez.

14:25.960 --> 14:26.960
Thank God.

14:26.960 --> 14:27.960
Thank God.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.280
Especially considering how bad those two guys mess up all the time.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.280
Am I right?

14:31.280 --> 14:34.840
And then when cats like happy jump in, you got somebody's got to edit that out.

14:34.840 --> 14:38.840
That was actually as a funny moment that happened during land last week, a little behind the

14:38.840 --> 14:42.760
scenes is we're sitting there recording and a cat for on Joe's side of the recording jumps

14:42.760 --> 14:43.760
up on his keyboard.

14:43.760 --> 14:44.760
Oh, yes.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.480
And it's like, I almost want to just leave that in the show.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.720
I thought that was worth leaving in there.

14:48.720 --> 14:49.860
It is in the telegram group.

14:49.860 --> 14:53.960
If you want to go hear that outtake, Joe did actually pop it in our Jupiter broadcasting

14:53.960 --> 14:58.660
telegram group at Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash telegram anyways.

14:58.660 --> 15:00.360
So these changes are coming down the pipe.

15:00.360 --> 15:06.160
I I am using this as an opportunity to convert the show to a multitrack recording so that

15:06.160 --> 15:07.360
Wes is on his own track.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.420
I'm on my own track.

15:08.420 --> 15:11.440
The Mumble Room is on his on their own track.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.080
Richard Stallman's on his own track.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.200
Get it out of here.

15:14.200 --> 15:19.000
And then they all get processed individually and it makes the audio sound much better.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.600
Everybody at the same level.

15:20.600 --> 15:24.680
That stuff's finally happening because it's like, well, if I'm going to be sitting down

15:24.680 --> 15:29.400
and taking over the edit for a bit, might as well do it the way I would want to do it

15:29.400 --> 15:30.400
now.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.900
Now, taking everything I've learned at some point, I'm going to hand this stuff off.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.080
Things will be changing.

15:35.080 --> 15:37.320
All of that is going to change in the future.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.800
But for right now, I'm kind of circling the wagons.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.000
I'm taking it in house.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.500
I'm doing the work.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.400
Not to sound braggadocios, but I'm going to try to move the bar up a little bit, get it

15:46.400 --> 15:47.400
to the next level.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.080
That's always my thing is try to move the quality up on all of our shows a little bit

15:50.080 --> 15:52.680
and optimize for the audio experience.

15:52.680 --> 15:53.680
Yes.

15:53.680 --> 15:59.360
And still provide the complete unadulterated video version is my thought for those who

15:59.360 --> 16:00.360
want it.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.360
Capture that live experience.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.360
Yeah.

16:02.360 --> 16:03.360
Yeah.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.360
So we'll see.

16:04.360 --> 16:05.360
We'll be experimenting with that.

16:05.360 --> 16:07.120
Things will come and go as we implement new stuff.

16:07.120 --> 16:12.200
But if you just want no fuss, get the show every single week and get the best version

16:12.200 --> 16:16.280
possibly available, linuxunplug.com slash subscribe.

16:16.280 --> 16:20.680
Just grab the feed that if you have that, you don't have to worry about any of this.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.680
But for those of you who follow us on the live stream or follow us on YouTube or download

16:24.680 --> 16:30.260
the MP4 from the feeds or whatever, you will see some experimentation happening there.

16:30.260 --> 16:31.480
We love you.

16:31.480 --> 16:32.760
We will work with you.

16:32.760 --> 16:33.760
Just give us time.

16:33.760 --> 16:34.760
I think that's fair.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.160
That was a lot.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.960
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

16:37.960 --> 16:41.640
Speaking of people like to mess with computers, people who like to run unofficial Android

16:41.640 --> 16:43.680
ROMs sort of got the slap down this week.

16:43.680 --> 16:49.680
It looks like Google has been tweaking how they, well, authenticate, I guess you could

16:49.680 --> 16:52.600
say, uncertified devices, quote unquote.

16:52.600 --> 16:56.000
This is a story over at xdadevelopers.com with several updates.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.840
So let's get through some of this.

16:57.840 --> 17:04.160
A device maker must follow the CDD, which is a compatibility test suite from Google,

17:04.160 --> 17:08.240
before they're allowed to preload Google apps and services on their device.

17:08.240 --> 17:11.620
You're familiar with this if you've ever loaded an unofficial ROM and then you've had to go

17:11.620 --> 17:13.320
out and get the G apps yourself.

17:13.320 --> 17:18.080
Well, earlier this week, XDA Forums received an anonymous tip from a person claiming to

17:18.080 --> 17:21.240
be within, quote unquote, the industry.

17:21.240 --> 17:27.320
This person who said they worked for an OEM notified them that Google was going to start

17:27.320 --> 17:32.200
entirely locking out newly built firmware from accessing G apps.

17:32.200 --> 17:37.320
And this change apparently went into effect March 16th, 2018, and affects all software

17:37.320 --> 17:40.800
builds made after that date.

17:40.800 --> 17:48.120
Now, yesterday, a member on the XDA Forums, a senior member at that, came across the exact

17:48.120 --> 17:53.560
problem on his own device, which kind of goes down the lines of you get a full screen error

17:53.560 --> 18:00.840
message that comes up that says in big red font, device is not certified by Google.

18:00.840 --> 18:06.120
And then it's got helpful instructions for users who purchase this device, unlicensed

18:06.120 --> 18:10.200
manufacturers, licensed manufacturers, and custom ROM users.

18:10.200 --> 18:16.240
Actually, the custom ROM users is worth reading because there is a way for you to personally

18:16.240 --> 18:18.840
authorize up to 100 devices.

18:18.840 --> 18:21.740
So you can actually get around this problem.

18:21.740 --> 18:23.920
So it's not the end of the world for custom ROM users.

18:23.920 --> 18:29.280
It doesn't appear to be affecting custom ROMs that are pretty popular, though.

18:29.280 --> 18:34.360
It's more like OEMs who have their own open source build of Android who have tried to

18:34.360 --> 18:40.160
cram G apps on there, like Google sort of being selective in how they apply this.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.160
Yeah, that makes sense.

18:41.160 --> 18:44.720
I can see that being a problem for them as well in trying to have some level of quality

18:44.720 --> 18:48.720
control so that they can have Android be a decent platform.

18:48.720 --> 18:51.320
Yeah, although Mini brings up a good question.

18:51.320 --> 18:52.800
Go ahead, Mini, or a good point.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.880
This could be an issue for Ubuntu Touch, huh?

18:54.880 --> 18:59.260
Well, this is really bad news for Ubuntu Touch or Salesforce.

18:59.260 --> 19:02.760
There is this sandbox solution called nbox.

19:02.760 --> 19:06.200
I think it is Ubuntu initiative.

19:06.200 --> 19:12.240
And this starts to work quite well on devices that have at least a 3.10 kernel.

19:12.240 --> 19:16.800
So with this announcement, lots of applications will not run on these devices because you

19:16.800 --> 19:19.440
can't install the Google services.

19:19.440 --> 19:20.440
That's the thing.

19:20.440 --> 19:21.440
Yeah.

19:21.440 --> 19:22.440
Yeah, you're right.

19:22.440 --> 19:27.280
There's this joke going in the selfish OS community about Google liking, like acting

19:27.280 --> 19:30.000
like someone who's slowly boiling some frogs.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.440
I mean, they started this open source project with Android, and now they're closing it down

19:34.440 --> 19:36.240
more and more.

19:36.240 --> 19:40.720
Yes, that is a point that I have made on this show before.

19:40.720 --> 19:44.240
And it really bothered me when this now feels like ancient history.

19:44.240 --> 19:49.600
But when they moved photos to a Play Store app from the open source photo management

19:49.600 --> 19:55.080
app that was on Android, that really for me, and that in Chrome.

19:55.080 --> 19:58.320
Remember when they switched from the open source browser to Chrome?

19:58.320 --> 20:00.120
Yeah, you're right.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.040
It has been a slow boil.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.880
More and more reliance on everything Google, all the APIs.

20:04.880 --> 20:06.640
Those insidious bastards.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.680
Joe, you run custom ROMs 24-7.

20:09.680 --> 20:10.680
Does this concern you at all?

20:10.680 --> 20:17.040
Or is that personal device activation slash registration thing sort of take care of it

20:17.040 --> 20:18.040
for you?

20:18.040 --> 20:20.280
Well, it worried me when I first heard about it.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.880
But then I looked into it and read more about it.

20:22.880 --> 20:25.240
And it's like, OK, it's going to be one more step.

20:25.240 --> 20:31.040
I'm going to have to extract the device ID and then go to a Google web page and input

20:31.040 --> 20:36.520
that and then get my device OK'd, whitelisted, whatever.

20:36.520 --> 20:41.360
So it's a little bit more hassle for me.

20:41.360 --> 20:50.480
But in terms of UbiPorts and Andbox, I mean, Andbox in UbiPorts is going to be the standout

20:50.480 --> 20:52.040
feature in 2018.

20:52.040 --> 20:57.920
And if this is going to make that harder to work, then that is very worrying for me.

20:57.920 --> 21:02.760
In terms of running lineage, it's a mainstream custom ROM.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.920
I'm not personally worried.

21:04.920 --> 21:12.560
But yeah, those extra ROMs like lineage and sorry, like UbiPorts and Sailfish, that's

21:12.560 --> 21:13.800
where I'm worried.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.560
Yeah, good point.

21:15.560 --> 21:20.160
And I also saw in the comments section on that forum, but it seems like a pretty good

21:20.160 --> 21:25.100
tip, that you can use Titanium Backup to back up your ID.

21:25.100 --> 21:29.520
And then when you load a new ROM, you can use Titanium Backup to restore that ID, then

21:29.520 --> 21:33.360
install Google Apps and the GApp stuff, and you shouldn't have a problem.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.080
Haven't tried it myself, obviously.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.880
But that seems like that should be pretty solid, like that could work.

21:37.880 --> 21:38.880
You know what?

21:38.880 --> 21:39.880
I in the past had used Titanium Backup.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.520
That was some good ass software.

21:41.520 --> 21:42.560
Titanium Backup.

21:42.560 --> 21:43.560
Just going to plug it.

21:43.560 --> 21:47.200
It is, you know, it is, you've got to pay for it to get the full thing and to really

21:47.200 --> 21:49.680
have it work, like to get the ID, you've got to have root on your device.

21:49.680 --> 21:55.040
But if you're loading custom ROMs, you probably already do.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.260
That isn't your issue.

21:56.260 --> 21:57.400
Now this is your issue.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.360
Like that was the easy part.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.100
Speaking of mobile, let's talk about Ting.

22:02.100 --> 22:03.560
It's smarter than unlimited.

22:03.560 --> 22:05.360
You use less, you pay less.

22:05.360 --> 22:06.360
Linux.ting.com.

22:06.360 --> 22:13.080
Linux.ting.com is where you go to get $25 in service credit if you bring a device, and

22:13.080 --> 22:17.320
$25 off a device if you want to buy one directly from Ting.

22:17.320 --> 22:19.680
And I really would encourage you just to go look.

22:19.680 --> 22:24.220
They've got a bunch of great devices that you may have never even considered.

22:24.220 --> 22:29.760
It's like we always talk about like three or four phones, but there are a ton of other

22:29.760 --> 22:30.800
great phones out there.

22:30.800 --> 22:35.260
And on the Ting blog too, if this is your thing, if this is your thing for Ting, they

22:35.260 --> 22:40.240
just did a roundup of their favorite flip phones, including, it's not quite a flip phone,

22:40.240 --> 22:42.640
but including the one that Noah got ages ago.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.480
It's about as thick as three credit cards.

22:44.480 --> 22:45.960
It's a little GSM phone.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.440
You can literally put it in your wallet.

22:48.440 --> 22:49.440
That's so easy.

22:49.440 --> 22:50.440
That's so nuts.

22:50.440 --> 22:51.440
I love it.

22:51.440 --> 22:54.120
And guys, a bunch of great devices if you want to grab one or just get a SIM or bring

22:54.120 --> 22:55.120
your own.

22:55.120 --> 22:56.840
Just start by going to Linux.ting.com.

22:56.840 --> 23:01.620
You pay for what you use, a fair price for however much you talk, text, or however much

23:01.620 --> 23:02.620
data you use.

23:02.620 --> 23:07.580
And they got nationwide coverage, GSM and CDMA, so you can rest assured that Ting has

23:07.580 --> 23:08.580
got you covered.

23:08.580 --> 23:14.520
I just took them down on my scale trip, and damn if the CDMA didn't rock it.

23:14.520 --> 23:17.460
Also, personal recommendation.

23:17.460 --> 23:21.720
If you are in the Eugene area of Oregon, holy crap.

23:21.720 --> 23:22.720
Holy crap.

23:22.720 --> 23:25.020
The Ting CDMA network is blazing.

23:25.020 --> 23:26.360
So is the GSM network.

23:26.360 --> 23:29.360
But better than that, crazy great ping times.

23:29.360 --> 23:33.920
I don't know what they're doing, but some of the best ping times I have had probably

23:33.920 --> 23:40.200
this year was when I was on my way to scale in Eugene, doing the show remotely.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.200
I did that whole show over the Ting connection.

23:42.200 --> 23:43.200
Remember that?

23:43.200 --> 23:44.200
It was wonderful, yeah.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.200
It worked great.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.200
And I did Coder before that too.

23:46.200 --> 23:47.200
I did two shows over that Ting connection.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.200
I love the flexibility.

23:48.200 --> 23:50.920
You know, you want it as a hotspot, they're not blocking any of that stuff.

23:50.920 --> 23:53.200
There's no big Ting strategy getting in the way.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.500
They don't have some play for video streaming.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.880
It's just pay for what you use wireless.

23:57.880 --> 23:59.040
It's great.

23:59.040 --> 24:02.600
Nationwide coverage, easy dashboard, fanatical customer service.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.520
Just start by going to linux.ting.com.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.480
And thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.680
That's linux.ting.com.

24:10.680 --> 24:14.280
So Microsoft is open sourcing something today.

24:14.280 --> 24:18.760
And when you hear about this, it's going to be like one of those, okay, that makes sense.

24:18.760 --> 24:23.680
They have open sourced a Windows subsystem for Linux.

24:23.680 --> 24:24.680
Is that the right?

24:24.680 --> 24:25.680
Windows subsystem for Linux?

24:25.680 --> 24:26.680
Yeah.

24:26.680 --> 24:32.080
A sample to let other distributions that they haven't reached out to personally follow,

24:32.080 --> 24:35.280
so that way they can package up their distro for the Windows store.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.640
Heyo!

24:36.640 --> 24:41.560
The new process makes it clear on how Linux distributions can be adapted to run on the

24:41.560 --> 24:43.720
Windows subsystem for Linux.

24:43.720 --> 24:46.440
It's called the WSL Distro Launcher.

24:46.440 --> 24:48.620
And it's now open source.

24:48.620 --> 24:54.200
It's a C++ code base offering the launcher that could be customized for particular distributions.

24:54.200 --> 24:58.800
And it helps you step through setting up the login shell, running commands, setting configuration

24:58.800 --> 24:59.800
values.

24:59.800 --> 25:00.800
Bob's your uncle.

25:00.800 --> 25:01.800
You're good to go.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.600
You grab this open source sample.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.600
Follow that.

25:04.600 --> 25:09.360
Then once you've got it all done, you just call up Microsoft and say, please, sir, please,

25:09.360 --> 25:12.040
I'd really like to be in your app store, please.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.200
Please let me in the app store.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.200
Yes, I know.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.200
I know.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.200
I'm just a little distro.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.200
I mean, you really go.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.200
I mean, that is part of the process.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.200
It is.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.200
It is legitimately part of the process.

25:20.200 --> 25:23.960
In fact, Microsoft outlines it right here on the Microsoft developer blog where they

25:23.960 --> 25:25.320
talk about it.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.120
And they say you have to submit it to the store.

25:27.120 --> 25:30.160
You'll have to work with us to receive publishing approval.

25:30.160 --> 25:33.720
If you're a Linux distribution owner interested in adding your distribution to the Microsoft

25:33.720 --> 25:37.760
store, contact us at WSPartners at Microsoft.com.

25:37.760 --> 25:39.400
You know what stood out to me about that article?

25:39.400 --> 25:41.640
They use the word sideload a lot.

25:41.640 --> 25:42.640
And it's just.

25:42.640 --> 25:43.640
Yeah.

25:43.640 --> 25:46.280
They used to be a lockdown mobile OS term.

25:46.280 --> 25:47.280
It's now a.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.280
Now it's a Windows term.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.280
Yeah.

25:49.280 --> 25:50.280
Right?

25:50.280 --> 25:51.280
Yeah.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.200
So the way they're doing this, too, is they're making these essentially universal Windows

25:53.200 --> 25:56.200
applications.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.720
Don't quote me on the terminology because, again, I'm not a big Windows guy.

25:58.720 --> 26:02.280
But they're UWP applications.

26:02.280 --> 26:06.480
UWP, which I think stands for Universal Windows something or others.

26:06.480 --> 26:10.800
And it's a way to package up an application and deliver it in the Windows store.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.520
You know, you and I went down on Friday night.

26:13.520 --> 26:18.520
We went out and had some beers with Mr. Wimpy, who was in Seattle.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.760
And he had been visiting some folks at Microsoft.

26:20.760 --> 26:21.760
I think that's all public.

26:21.760 --> 26:23.360
I think I'm allowed to say that.

26:23.360 --> 26:28.040
And it was interesting hearing his insights into the conversations with Microsoft and

26:28.040 --> 26:30.480
where they're at with all of this stuff.

26:30.480 --> 26:31.760
It's a real sea change.

26:31.760 --> 26:37.580
And it's super hard for those of us that have been in the Linux community since the early

26:37.580 --> 26:40.600
days to really wrap our head around it.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.000
And I completely agreed with Wimpy's take.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.720
So I'm not putting words in Wimpy's mouth.

26:45.720 --> 26:49.120
He just sort of said some of the things that I personally identified.

26:49.120 --> 26:53.200
And that was when I was there weeks ago talking to them.

26:53.200 --> 27:02.120
They don't have this air of guilt, or they're not coming at this apologetically, or they're

27:02.120 --> 27:03.880
not groveling.

27:03.880 --> 27:08.160
They're not treating it like, oh, we've been a bad boy, and we're really sorry, and now

27:08.160 --> 27:11.080
we want to be friends with WinX.

27:11.080 --> 27:12.840
We have a legitimate technology.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.240
The open source community has a legitimate technology.

27:15.240 --> 27:18.360
There's no reason that we can't make these two things work together, because that's exactly

27:18.360 --> 27:19.760
what our customers want.

27:19.760 --> 27:23.360
It's not because all of a sudden they've gotten the smell of RMS.

27:23.360 --> 27:29.480
It's not because all of a sudden they just have totally embraced the Linux and Unix philosophies.

27:29.480 --> 27:34.040
It's simply because they've figured out customers will pay us really good money to make this

27:34.040 --> 27:35.040
shit work.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.060
It's business over philosophy now.

27:37.060 --> 27:41.840
And so they're meeting on this sort of technical level.

27:41.840 --> 27:47.880
There's nothing to do with the former emotional baggage attached with Microsoft's battle against

27:47.880 --> 27:49.360
Linux and open source.

27:49.360 --> 27:53.680
And it's fascinating to watch it, because from the outside, you have no perception of it.

27:53.680 --> 27:54.960
Microsoft makes an announcement.

27:54.960 --> 28:00.080
It comes from this large company that has lots of money and lots of people.

28:00.080 --> 28:05.280
And you can't really understand the four or five years of work behind the scenes that's

28:05.280 --> 28:07.280
been happening.

28:07.280 --> 28:11.720
And so when you see stuff like that, it's really easy to go, shit, Microsoft is just

28:11.720 --> 28:14.640
going to be like, they're going to be the cancer.

28:14.640 --> 28:20.200
They're going to spread all over Linux, and they're going to embrace and extinguish.

28:20.200 --> 28:24.560
When you see things like, now it's easy for anybody to package up a distro on the Windows

28:24.560 --> 28:25.560
store.

28:25.560 --> 28:31.520
But the reality is, it seems to be that the nature of Linux, open source, and the GPL

28:31.520 --> 28:34.720
is this unstoppable snowball.

28:34.720 --> 28:36.520
It really is.

28:36.520 --> 28:41.040
Every time these companies have tried to embrace and extinguish, they just end up being part

28:41.040 --> 28:42.040
of the snowball.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.040
They just get caught up with it.

28:43.040 --> 28:45.680
And I think that's what's happening even to a large company like Microsoft.

28:45.680 --> 28:51.240
It's not that Microsoft is trying to rip off Linux users or buy off Linux or trying to

28:51.240 --> 28:53.680
influence open source development.

28:53.680 --> 29:00.080
It's that even a company as large as Microsoft couldn't stop the Linux open source snowball.

29:00.080 --> 29:04.160
Yeah, they're just forced to play ball with it, because that's what makes business sense.

29:04.160 --> 29:08.200
But the emotional reaction when you see that is, oh, man, these bastards at Microsoft are

29:08.200 --> 29:12.480
trying to embrace and extinguish, and this is yet another way that they're doing it.

29:12.480 --> 29:19.080
But I think that undersells the power of Linux, GPL, and open source.

29:19.080 --> 29:25.300
I think you're underselling how responsible they are for making a massive C shift in which

29:25.300 --> 29:28.720
the entire industry has to respond to, even IBM and Microsoft.

29:28.720 --> 29:29.720
Right.

29:29.720 --> 29:33.040
And I don't think that necessarily means we have to completely be on board with the Microsoft

29:33.040 --> 29:34.040
part.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.040
It's a Linux thing, right?

29:35.040 --> 29:37.640
She'll be skeptical of their motives and try to understand where they're coming from and

29:37.640 --> 29:38.640
what they're doing.

29:38.640 --> 29:42.880
But they're not necessarily some evil Linux-hating monstrosity anymore.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.160
Cautiously optimistic skepticism.

29:44.160 --> 29:45.560
Yeah, there we go.

29:45.560 --> 29:46.560
Perfect way to put it.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.240
Yeah, I think that's a great way to put it.

29:48.240 --> 29:53.200
I'm also cautiously optimistic about this new 3D Wayland compositor, which I saw you

29:53.200 --> 29:54.320
submitted to RLinux.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.900
That's actually how I saw this story run.

29:56.900 --> 30:01.720
So what caught your attention about this, other than it's yet another Wayland compositor,

30:01.720 --> 30:03.440
this one is called Wayfire.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.200
It's based on LibWestin.

30:05.200 --> 30:10.060
They say they aim to create a customizable and extensible and extendable lightweight

30:10.060 --> 30:12.940
environment without sacrificing appearance.

30:12.940 --> 30:17.240
Those things appeal to me, but was there something else that caught your attention, Ron?

30:17.240 --> 30:21.760
Yeah, there's a lot of stuff that they had in...

30:21.760 --> 30:26.240
The concept that they're working on is to move some stuff that are already in existing

30:26.240 --> 30:30.200
compositors and window managers and making it possible to work in Wayfire so that can

30:30.200 --> 30:31.460
be used in Wayland.

30:31.460 --> 30:37.320
So the most obvious one, and even the jokie one, is the desktop cube.

30:37.320 --> 30:38.320
Yeah, totally.

30:38.320 --> 30:42.680
Yeah, that was the number one comment, like, yes, finally, somebody understands I want

30:42.680 --> 30:44.200
my desktop cube back.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.200
Yeah, exactly.

30:45.200 --> 30:48.040
And it's actually kind of funny because the way they're doing the desktop cube is interesting

30:48.040 --> 30:54.000
because the cube itself is modifiable in weird ways, like you can make it concave and convex

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
and stuff.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Finally.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Yeah, of course.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Who doesn't need that?

30:58.000 --> 31:03.680
But there's other things that are actually somewhat more useful in the sense of the expo

31:03.680 --> 31:07.960
mode that it's going to have built into it, and it already has some of this stuff already

31:07.960 --> 31:08.960
working.

31:08.960 --> 31:09.960
It's in pre-alpha.

31:09.960 --> 31:13.940
I mean, we joke, but I guess the advantage here is then the desktop environment folks

31:13.940 --> 31:15.640
don't have to invent how to do that, right?

31:15.640 --> 31:18.380
So it's just done for them.

31:18.380 --> 31:22.920
The one thing that made me really the most interested was probably the fact that they

31:22.920 --> 31:25.760
were talking about having window rules work.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.880
The compositor itself with window rules, that is amazing.

31:28.880 --> 31:29.880
Yeah, yeah.

31:29.880 --> 31:34.560
What's the point of the perfect 60 frames a second compositing if we can't have desktop

31:34.560 --> 31:35.560
cubes?

31:35.560 --> 31:39.440
This isn't probably very applicable to like Mudder or KWindow, right?

31:39.440 --> 31:43.520
I mean, this is for desktop environments that don't necessarily have a solution in place.

31:43.520 --> 31:49.560
Yeah, if they don't have a compositor, this would be for that, like basically the window

31:49.560 --> 31:53.920
managers that are dependent on X and stuff like that.

31:53.920 --> 31:56.120
So this is a solution.

31:56.120 --> 31:57.920
We see different things coming up.

31:57.920 --> 32:02.560
I have a pretty strong inclination that we're going to hear more about Mir in the future,

32:02.560 --> 32:07.720
about that as a middle layer between Wayland and the desktop environments, but this is

32:07.720 --> 32:09.000
another option.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.720
And it's up on GitHub.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.360
Did you get a sense of how far along they are?

32:12.360 --> 32:16.240
I mean, it looks like they have some basic stuff currently implemented, good stuff, even

32:16.240 --> 32:17.760
like touchscreen gestures and stuff.

32:17.760 --> 32:22.140
They're basically saying, this is prototyping stuff that we can show works but don't rely

32:22.140 --> 32:23.140
on it.

32:23.140 --> 32:28.440
But they're saying that it's a pre-alpha stage, so that they're not really claiming anyone

32:28.440 --> 32:29.620
should use it.

32:29.620 --> 32:32.260
But they are talking about that it already works with X Wayland.

32:32.260 --> 32:37.360
So like any X Wayland clients, you could already use it.

32:37.360 --> 32:38.360
That's nice.

32:38.360 --> 32:39.360
Good.

32:39.360 --> 32:44.360
As soon as a distro actually supports this, because I'm going to see if Arch or something

32:44.360 --> 32:49.160
like that would be interested in it, as soon as someone supports it, I'm going to definitely

32:49.160 --> 32:50.160
check it out.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.160
Yeah.

32:51.160 --> 32:55.280
I like that they're trying to solve some hard technical challenges for some of these desktop

32:55.280 --> 32:56.280
environments.

32:56.280 --> 32:57.280
Kind of push the conversation forward a bit.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.280
Yep.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.280
Wayfire.

32:59.280 --> 33:03.400
Wayfire will have a link, linuxunplugged.com, slash 242.

33:03.400 --> 33:09.900
One of the nice bennies about having the linuxunplugged.com site set up is we can make changes at jb.com

33:09.900 --> 33:12.700
and if you just fall in there, it doesn't matter, you know?

33:12.700 --> 33:16.440
If you just want the Linux Unplugged show, mm-hmm, yeah.

33:16.440 --> 33:25.420
Maybe what we ought to do is build a whole new infrastructure up on DigitalOcean, do.co.unplugged.

33:25.420 --> 33:32.400
Go there for a limited time and sign up and get $100 credit for a new account, $100 credit.

33:32.400 --> 33:33.880
I don't know how long they're going to do this.

33:33.880 --> 33:35.800
They told me it'd be a limited time.

33:35.800 --> 33:36.800
Maybe it's already over.

33:36.800 --> 33:40.360
Maybe you should just go right now and find out, do.co.unplugged.

33:40.360 --> 33:43.240
Find out because what an incredible value.

33:43.240 --> 33:46.240
Honestly, $10 would get you by for two months.

33:46.240 --> 33:51.760
You could run a DigitalOcean Droplet two months for free with $10, with $10.

33:51.760 --> 33:56.200
If you go to do.co.unplugged, you get a $100 credit.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.480
I have a suspicion.

33:57.480 --> 34:00.200
I believe it's because they're rolling out these new Droplet plans.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.400
Now for years, they've been a sponsor here on the Unplugged program and you know that

34:03.400 --> 34:06.060
they offer really great pricing on Droplets.

34:06.060 --> 34:11.080
My favorite system is three cents an hour, three cents an hour.

34:11.080 --> 34:12.080
That's great.

34:12.080 --> 34:15.360
You can get the $5 a month Droplet, run it two months for free with our standard promo

34:15.360 --> 34:19.520
but now when you go to do.co.unplugged and get the $100 credit, why not play with some

34:19.520 --> 34:20.520
of the big boys?

34:20.520 --> 34:25.680
They got high CPU Droplets, flexible Droplets where you can mix and match the resources.

34:25.680 --> 34:27.040
They got high RAM Droplets.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.040
Go to town.

34:28.040 --> 34:29.040
Load everything up in RAM.

34:29.040 --> 34:30.040
Go cray-cray.

34:30.040 --> 34:32.320
Do what Wes does and run everything from a RAM disk.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.320
You do that, right, Wes?

34:33.320 --> 34:34.320
That's what you do?

34:34.320 --> 34:35.320
Of course I do.

34:35.320 --> 34:36.320
Why not?

34:36.320 --> 34:39.480
Wes does two things and only two things, runs everything as root and runs everything out

34:39.480 --> 34:40.480
of RAM.

34:40.480 --> 34:43.840
That's why I don't lean and mean, baby.

34:43.840 --> 34:48.460
Just go to do.co.unplugged to sign up and try out their new flexible Droplets.

34:48.460 --> 34:50.120
Mix and match the resources you need.

34:50.120 --> 34:51.580
Play around with snapshots.

34:51.580 --> 34:56.240
You can use the team accounts and then if you ever get stuck, they have fantastic documentation

34:56.240 --> 35:00.680
including a new tutorial that went live just a couple of hours ago about how to configure

35:00.680 --> 35:06.160
16.04, Ubuntu 16.04 to reject a whole bunch of bogus SSH connections.

35:06.160 --> 35:08.920
Something that like monitors for connections, I'm not talking failed ban, I'm talking about

35:08.920 --> 35:09.920
something different.

35:09.920 --> 35:14.640
It monitors for bogus login attempts and then starts banning those IPs automatically.

35:14.640 --> 35:18.360
That's the kind of great documentation that DigitalOcean has on their website all the

35:18.360 --> 35:19.360
time.

35:19.360 --> 35:25.640
They have professional folks that keep that stuff lean, mean, and easy to read, do.co.unplugged.

35:25.640 --> 35:31.280
Go there, sign up, and try out their new flexible Droplets, do.co.unplugged.

35:31.280 --> 35:38.520
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program, do.co.unplugged.

35:38.520 --> 35:45.460
So I will admit that living in a Class A RV has made me particularly interested in running

35:45.460 --> 35:52.680
everything from batteries, but what if you had your own Tesla Powerwall?

35:52.680 --> 35:54.120
You know about the Powerwall, right?

35:54.120 --> 35:56.680
That was something that Tesla introduced for homeowners.

35:56.680 --> 36:02.680
It's kind of funky because you have to be on an actual residential property.

36:02.680 --> 36:07.120
You can't just go buy some land in Arizona and set up a Powerwall.

36:07.120 --> 36:09.160
You have to be at a residence.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.520
You have to have an internet connection to use a Powerwall.

36:11.520 --> 36:18.560
And after you've spent $5,500, you then essentially have supplemental power in case the electricity

36:18.560 --> 36:19.560
goes out.

36:19.560 --> 36:20.560
It's kind of funky.

36:20.560 --> 36:23.360
Just a big battery bank sort of plugged in to everything.

36:23.360 --> 36:28.120
Wouldn't it be great if you could build that yourself from, say, old laptop batteries?

36:28.120 --> 36:29.280
Turns out actually a thing.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.400
In fact, laptop batteries are particularly good at this.

36:32.400 --> 36:38.840
You could build your own wall, and there's a link that we'll put in the show notes that

36:38.840 --> 36:43.240
you can go check out, including a bunch of different folks who essentially worked it

36:43.240 --> 36:46.400
out and said it's about $5 per battery.

36:46.400 --> 36:53.040
And one bloke out of Australia has this unbelievable setup with 40 solar panels in his roof.

36:53.040 --> 36:58.300
He's pulling down 40 kilowatt hours, and then he has these racks of batteries.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.920
So they look like double A's.

37:00.920 --> 37:05.600
But if you were to break open your laptop, your lithium ion battery in your laptop, and

37:05.600 --> 37:09.960
take the casing off of it, they're like individual double A-looking batteries in there.

37:09.960 --> 37:13.840
And they've got this particular color that is set by the industry, so that's how you

37:13.840 --> 37:16.100
know they're the kind of battery that you need.

37:16.100 --> 37:18.200
And I don't know, like cyan, I don't know exactly.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.800
How would you describe that color, Wes?

37:20.800 --> 37:23.280
It's like a blue-ish, like a sky blue, I guess.

37:23.280 --> 37:24.280
Yeah, something like that.

37:24.280 --> 37:29.400
And when you get ones that are sky blue, you essentially have the right battery.

37:29.400 --> 37:33.240
And depending on how many you have, depending on how many laptops you want to murder, you

37:33.240 --> 37:38.280
could set up a Powerwall yourself using a Raspberry Pi to manage all of this.

37:38.280 --> 37:39.280
And here's an example.

37:39.280 --> 37:42.720
So the Tesla Powerwall is capable of storing 14 kilowatt hours.

37:42.720 --> 37:47.100
But this dude built one that could store 40 kilowatt hours out of Australia.

37:47.100 --> 37:49.360
And there's a whole DIY Powerwall form.

37:49.360 --> 37:53.640
And I thought, this is pretty good, this is interesting, this is useful.

37:53.640 --> 38:01.720
But if you combine this with a project that Joe and I covered on Linux Action News by

38:01.720 --> 38:05.960
Eric Raymond, then you'd really be cooking with gas.

38:05.960 --> 38:11.240
Eric Raymond, ESR, recently launched the Upside project.

38:11.240 --> 38:17.440
And they're currently defining the requirements for a smart UPS, because UPSs suck.

38:17.440 --> 38:21.740
They're bad, they don't really, they don't intelligently monitor the battery, they don't

38:21.740 --> 38:26.180
intelligently watch the charge, they're just the worst.

38:26.180 --> 38:30.320
And so ESR was sort of waxing on about this.

38:30.320 --> 38:34.120
And from that, created the Upside project, people have joined on, and they've created

38:34.120 --> 38:40.800
a full requirements now of what you need to do smart charging, to control the monitoring,

38:40.800 --> 38:44.960
to fail into a bypass mode instead of completely failing off and cutting the power, what the

38:44.960 --> 38:46.840
minimum runtimes should be.

38:46.840 --> 38:51.400
I'm proposing that, I'm doing matchmaking right here on the show, these two different

38:51.400 --> 38:58.680
initiatives, the DIY Powerwall, and ESR's Upside project, they should at least start

38:58.680 --> 39:02.440
maybe flirting, take each other out to dinner or something, because this could be a great

39:02.440 --> 39:04.720
combination of efforts.

39:04.720 --> 39:08.920
Something that you could build yourself from your old crappy laptops, and then something

39:08.920 --> 39:12.800
to actually manage and monitor and keep everything working well.

39:12.800 --> 39:17.160
It's an example of two kind of side things that are going on out there.

39:17.160 --> 39:20.440
People are discussing, people are trying to figure out, because the technology has just

39:20.440 --> 39:24.080
kind of gotten there and made all of this stuff accessible, but they're not really coming

39:24.080 --> 39:26.120
together yet.

39:26.120 --> 39:29.940
Maybe they never will, but I love the idea of these two things.

39:29.940 --> 39:35.880
You take Upside, the smart UPS, you take the DIY Powerwall, you bring them together, Wes.

39:35.880 --> 39:36.880
It's a kumbaya.

39:36.880 --> 39:40.640
Yeah, if you're already managing power, just do it at the whole house scale.

39:40.640 --> 39:43.680
And you could then do it without any of that cloud crap or anything else.

39:43.680 --> 39:47.360
Yeah, I mean, if we're not going to have reactors in our backyards, maybe we could have Powerwalls.

39:47.360 --> 39:48.360
Solar panels.

39:48.360 --> 39:49.360
You don't?

39:49.360 --> 39:50.360
No, I don't.

39:50.360 --> 39:51.360
Oh, no.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.360
They didn't make it out to the West.

39:52.360 --> 39:53.360
They didn't make it here.

39:53.360 --> 39:54.360
They didn't make it out here.

39:54.360 --> 39:55.360
We're uncivilized.

39:55.360 --> 39:56.360
Maybe someday.

39:56.360 --> 39:57.360
All right.

39:57.360 --> 40:02.440
Well, if that's not your thing, then you're one of those people, and you probably like

40:02.440 --> 40:03.440
Electron apps.

40:03.440 --> 40:05.220
Yeah, I'm onto you.

40:05.220 --> 40:06.460
You like Electron apps.

40:06.460 --> 40:07.960
You got Slack installed.

40:07.960 --> 40:10.800
Oh, Skype and Spotify too?

40:10.800 --> 40:13.000
Well, there's no helping you.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.760
Then we might as well pile on.

40:15.760 --> 40:19.600
How about an Electron-based terminal?

40:19.600 --> 40:20.600
Yeah.

40:20.600 --> 40:21.600
You're right.

40:21.600 --> 40:22.600
That's the last thing.

40:22.600 --> 40:26.180
Every other thing I run is basically running Chrome somehow, right?

40:26.180 --> 40:27.180
But not the terminal.

40:27.180 --> 40:28.180
Mm-hmm.

40:28.180 --> 40:29.180
You're welcome.

40:29.180 --> 40:30.180
You're welcome.

40:30.180 --> 40:31.180
My life is complete.

40:31.180 --> 40:32.180
You see what I do for you?

40:32.180 --> 40:33.180
You see, I do this for you.

40:33.180 --> 40:34.280
It's called Hyper.

40:34.280 --> 40:38.880
And it's a modern terminal built on web technologies.

40:38.880 --> 40:39.880
That's what they say.

40:39.880 --> 40:41.040
It's built on web technologies.

40:41.040 --> 40:42.060
And you know what, Wes?

40:42.060 --> 40:43.960
It actually looks kind of good.

40:43.960 --> 40:44.960
Check it out.

40:44.960 --> 40:45.960
Go to hyper.is.

40:45.960 --> 40:46.960
Hyper.is.

40:46.960 --> 40:52.360
Take a look at this thing, and tell me at least some part of you doesn't kind of want

40:52.360 --> 40:54.080
to run this.

40:54.080 --> 40:57.600
Maybe Joe, the XFC user of the house, maybe this doesn't appeal to him.

40:57.600 --> 40:58.600
I don't know.

40:58.600 --> 40:59.600
All right.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.120
I'm launching the app image right now.

41:01.120 --> 41:02.560
Do you see how they have effects when you type?

41:02.560 --> 41:03.960
You see how they have the blasting?

41:03.960 --> 41:06.280
They have destructo effects when you type.

41:06.280 --> 41:07.280
Look at that.

41:07.280 --> 41:08.280
You see that?

41:08.280 --> 41:09.280
Whoa.

41:09.280 --> 41:10.280
Fancy.

41:10.280 --> 41:11.280
Yeah.

41:11.280 --> 41:13.240
They have confetti blowing up from the cursor when you type.

41:13.240 --> 41:15.960
I mean, obviously you want that.

41:15.960 --> 41:17.280
Obviously you need that.

41:17.280 --> 41:21.040
So why not get a terminal that uses Electron?

41:21.040 --> 41:22.040
Wait.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.040
What's the matter, Wes?

41:23.040 --> 41:24.040
So there we go.

41:24.040 --> 41:25.040
That was easy.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.040
Yeah, that was.

41:26.040 --> 41:27.040
It actually looks really, really good.

41:27.040 --> 41:28.040
It's pretty sharp.

41:28.040 --> 41:29.040
Yeah.

41:29.040 --> 41:30.200
That looks really nice, actually.

41:30.200 --> 41:32.200
I might just give it a try for a while.

41:32.200 --> 41:33.200
Why not?

41:33.200 --> 41:34.200
The default font could be a little better.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.200
Yeah, right.

41:35.200 --> 41:36.200
I'm not going to lie.

41:36.200 --> 41:38.600
Wouldn't it be weird if there was multiples of these?

41:38.600 --> 41:39.600
Is there?

41:39.600 --> 41:40.600
Is that a thing?

41:40.600 --> 41:41.600
Upterm.

41:41.600 --> 41:42.600
Oh, really?

41:42.600 --> 41:43.600
Oh, no.

41:43.600 --> 41:44.600
OK.

41:44.600 --> 41:45.600
What's the URL?

41:45.600 --> 41:46.600
What's the URL?

41:46.600 --> 41:47.600
Oh, yeah.

41:47.600 --> 41:48.600
It's a GitHub repo.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.880
A terminal for the 21st century.

41:50.880 --> 41:51.880
Pretty nice scrolling.

41:51.880 --> 41:52.880
Yeah.

41:52.880 --> 41:53.880
It does have nice scrolling.

41:53.880 --> 41:54.880
I agree.

41:54.880 --> 41:55.880
Oh.

41:55.880 --> 41:56.880
You know what?

41:56.880 --> 41:57.880
I kind of like this better, actually.

41:57.880 --> 41:58.880
Listen.

41:58.880 --> 41:59.880
It's an IDE plus terminal thing.

41:59.880 --> 42:00.880
Yeah.

42:00.880 --> 42:07.100
With legit syntax completion, which is kind of nice.

42:07.100 --> 42:08.100
I can't.

42:08.100 --> 42:09.100
OK.

42:09.100 --> 42:10.100
I'll put a link to this in the show notes, too.

42:10.100 --> 42:11.100
Wow.

42:11.100 --> 42:12.440
So not one, but two Electron terminals.

42:12.440 --> 42:13.440
That's actually a thing.

42:13.440 --> 42:14.440
I mean.

42:14.440 --> 42:15.440
And it's in the AUR.

42:15.440 --> 42:16.440
Is it?

42:16.440 --> 42:17.440
Is nothing sacred?

42:17.440 --> 42:18.800
Is nothing sacred?

42:18.800 --> 42:19.800
The terminal?

42:19.800 --> 42:23.480
Like on Windows, I can understand it, because the default command prompt on Windows sucks

42:23.480 --> 42:26.600
so bad that, you know, they really need something over there.

42:26.600 --> 42:29.480
But oh, man, I can't even with that.

42:29.480 --> 42:30.480
All right.

42:30.480 --> 42:31.480
Well, so we so I guess.

42:31.480 --> 42:33.420
So there's one app pick for you.

42:33.420 --> 42:34.680
Two for one.

42:34.680 --> 42:35.680
Hey, you're welcome.

42:35.680 --> 42:39.560
Before you move on, Chris, there's one big question about these Electron terminals.

42:39.560 --> 42:40.560
OK.

42:40.560 --> 42:45.360
Do they have an option to give a black background and green text?

42:45.360 --> 42:46.360
Well, you feel like you're in the matrix.

42:46.360 --> 42:47.360
Right.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.360
You've got to.

42:48.360 --> 42:49.360
Yeah.

42:49.360 --> 42:50.360
You've got to.

42:50.360 --> 42:51.360
Yes.

42:51.360 --> 42:52.360
Yeah.

42:52.360 --> 42:53.360
Yeah, of course.

42:53.360 --> 42:54.360
That's that's like you don't even ship unless you've got that.

42:54.360 --> 42:55.360
You don't even ship.

42:55.360 --> 42:56.360
OK.

42:56.360 --> 42:57.360
So if you don't like it, you can just edit the CSS because it's a problem.

42:57.360 --> 42:58.360
Oh, gosh.

42:58.360 --> 42:59.360
This is just gone.

42:59.360 --> 43:01.240
This has gone a horrible direction.

43:01.240 --> 43:04.600
I can't believe we're talking about editing the CSS of our terminal window.

43:04.600 --> 43:05.760
OK.

43:05.760 --> 43:07.240
Maybe I can redeem myself.

43:07.240 --> 43:08.360
This is a native application.

43:08.360 --> 43:09.620
How about that?

43:09.620 --> 43:12.200
It's called MP4 Tools.

43:12.200 --> 43:18.000
And what I like about MP4 Tools is that it's a collection of two applications that allow

43:18.000 --> 43:22.280
you to muck about with your MP4 files without reencoding them.

43:22.280 --> 43:23.280
Nice.

43:23.280 --> 43:24.280
That's always good.

43:24.280 --> 43:25.280
Yeah.

43:25.280 --> 43:26.280
It saves time.

43:26.280 --> 43:27.280
You don't lose quality.

43:27.280 --> 43:32.920
So MP4 Tools consists of two different applications available for Linux.

43:32.920 --> 43:40.640
MP4 Joiner is a free application that will join multiple MP4 files into one without recoding

43:40.640 --> 43:42.120
and without any quality loss.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.300
So no retouching the file at all.

43:44.300 --> 43:45.920
And then, so that's MP4 Joiner.

43:45.920 --> 43:50.720
And then, as you would expect, you've got MP4 Splitter, which is a free application

43:50.720 --> 43:58.400
that allows you to split MP4 files into multiple MP4 files without having to re-encode them.

43:58.400 --> 44:03.080
I am going to be using this for some of our live stuff because I'm recording here in OBS

44:03.080 --> 44:04.080
on this Linux box.

44:04.080 --> 44:08.200
And then I'm going to take this MP4 file, and I'll probably just do a little chop and

44:08.200 --> 44:11.520
drop and then upload it up to YouTube and upload it to Scale Engine.

44:11.520 --> 44:14.760
And I'll be using AvidMux and MP4 Tools to do that.

44:14.760 --> 44:15.760
Nice.

44:15.760 --> 44:16.760
Why not spread the love?

44:16.760 --> 44:20.080
MP4Joiner.org if you want to check that out.

44:20.080 --> 44:21.680
And yeah, AvidMux too.

44:21.680 --> 44:22.680
So there you go.

44:22.680 --> 44:24.320
We've got Electron Terminals for you this week.

44:24.320 --> 44:25.920
We've got MP4 Tools.

44:25.920 --> 44:29.440
You can use your fun new tools in your fun new terminal.

44:29.440 --> 44:30.440
There it is.

44:30.440 --> 44:31.440
Oh, great.

44:31.440 --> 44:34.920
I was just waiting for that.

44:34.920 --> 44:38.120
Fucking A. Did you look at it wrong again?

44:38.120 --> 44:41.560
So when we're recording Linux unplugged or whatever we're recording and GNOME crashes

44:41.560 --> 44:46.480
like it literally just did while I'm talking about this as if I did this on purpose, I

44:46.480 --> 44:51.040
can now use MP4 Joiner to rejoin these files together so I can upload this live version

44:51.040 --> 44:52.040
that's been recorded locally.

44:52.040 --> 44:53.960
I mean, how perfect is that?

44:53.960 --> 44:58.820
Like I was literally about to explain why I got these MP4 Tools because GNOME 3 crashes

44:58.820 --> 45:01.080
on us so often when it just crashed on us.

45:01.080 --> 45:03.760
That's proof is in the pudding.

45:03.760 --> 45:05.500
That is amazing.

45:05.500 --> 45:06.500
That is amazing.

45:06.500 --> 45:08.680
MP4 Joiner.org, enough said there.

45:08.680 --> 45:09.680
Go get your Electron apps.

45:09.680 --> 45:11.040
Go get your MP4s.

45:11.040 --> 45:13.120
I don't have any more to say about that.

45:13.120 --> 45:14.400
Linux Academy.

45:14.400 --> 45:19.960
Boy, if you want to go figure out why GNOME 3 crashes on you all the time, Linux Academy.

45:19.960 --> 45:24.480
You need to get started somewhere and this is probably the best place to start.

45:24.480 --> 45:25.480
Yeah.

45:25.480 --> 45:28.240
You need to learn how to read the log, learn where all that stuff's on the file system.

45:28.240 --> 45:30.120
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

45:30.120 --> 45:34.360
Go there, support the show and sign up for a free seven day trial.

45:34.360 --> 45:39.160
It's an advanced training platform that teaches you everything you need to know about Linux.

45:39.160 --> 45:43.440
I was just going to say, Wes, you and I get a question, like a super generic question

45:43.440 --> 45:50.120
that comes into TechSnap that we really kind of identify with and it's, how do I get started?

45:50.120 --> 45:51.440
Where do I get training?

45:51.440 --> 45:55.240
What do I need to do next to take my career somewhere in IT or to get started in IT or

45:55.240 --> 45:56.500
to go to the next level in IT?

45:56.500 --> 46:01.640
Before the show started today, you and I were having a conversation literally about like,

46:01.640 --> 46:05.800
do we need to do like a dedicated segment in TechSnap addressing that question because

46:05.800 --> 46:06.800
it comes up so frequently.

46:06.800 --> 46:07.800
Right.

46:07.800 --> 46:08.800
Yeah, exactly.

46:08.800 --> 46:09.800
And it's hard to know.

46:09.800 --> 46:11.760
There's so many options and there's outdated, tons of outdated information.

46:11.760 --> 46:14.120
It can be really confusing if you don't already know.

46:14.120 --> 46:15.120
Yeah.

46:15.120 --> 46:18.680
And I think the other problem that the industry as a whole suffers from is all of these online

46:18.680 --> 46:23.120
training platforms that want to teach you everything and Linux is just one of the things

46:23.120 --> 46:24.120
that they want to teach you.

46:24.120 --> 46:25.960
You know, they'll also teach you After Effects.

46:25.960 --> 46:30.520
They'll also teach you how to do something on Windows Active Directory if you want.

46:30.520 --> 46:33.120
They're happy to teach you like all these stuff, like Photoshop.

46:33.120 --> 46:36.040
They don't care, but you do.

46:36.040 --> 46:37.040
You care.

46:37.040 --> 46:40.420
You want somebody who is dedicated to the topic that you need to learn about.

46:40.420 --> 46:42.160
You want the expert in that field.

46:42.160 --> 46:46.560
You want a company that is hiring full-time instructors that are going out there and taking

46:46.560 --> 46:51.980
the certification test, learning the material, eating and breathing Linux, and then writing

46:51.980 --> 46:53.200
courseware about it.

46:53.200 --> 46:56.600
That's what you want because you want to kick ass when you go out to take the test, when

46:56.600 --> 46:59.280
you want to get the next job, when you want to go somewhere in your career, or when you

46:59.280 --> 47:02.320
want to challenge yourself, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

47:02.320 --> 47:04.000
You sign up for a free seven-day trial.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.660
You get to try out the platform, hands-on, scenario-based labs that give you experience

47:07.660 --> 47:09.360
on real servers.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.480
Instructor mentoring is available.

47:10.480 --> 47:12.040
If you get stuck, you need help.

47:12.040 --> 47:15.000
They have real human beings that can help you and answer questions.

47:15.000 --> 47:19.760
They have self-paced, in-depth video courses, and if you're busy, they've got course schedulers

47:19.760 --> 47:22.200
to help you pick a time frame and stick to it.

47:22.200 --> 47:27.720
And if you're ready for certifications, they've got stuff dedicated for that, too, linuxacademy.com

47:27.720 --> 47:29.380
slash unplugged.

47:29.380 --> 47:35.240
Go there, get a free seven-day trial, support the show, and take it to the next level, linuxacademy.com

47:35.240 --> 47:38.760
slash unplugged.

47:38.760 --> 47:42.400
We've been thinking recently, you know, with all the talk about plasma, that we need to

47:42.400 --> 47:48.080
kind of expand our horizons a bit, try different distros, try different desktop environments.

47:48.080 --> 47:49.080
Break out of these blinders.

47:49.080 --> 47:52.880
I mean, I never considered XFC because nobody ever suggests it.

47:52.880 --> 47:53.880
Not at all.

47:53.880 --> 47:54.880
Never.

47:54.880 --> 47:58.440
The only thing I've been thinking about recently is Fluxbox and Debian, and that's where Slacks

47:58.440 --> 47:59.440
comes in.

47:59.440 --> 48:05.600
Slacks 9.4 was released this week, and they've got a couple of unique features that I think

48:05.600 --> 48:06.800
are worth talking about.

48:06.800 --> 48:11.480
First of all, distro that is built to be a live distro, first and foremost.

48:11.480 --> 48:15.080
You flash it to your USB media, and then you run from there.

48:15.080 --> 48:20.120
Sacks also is doing a couple of other neat things, including ways to manage Wi-Fi and

48:20.120 --> 48:25.560
a couple other nice things, but there's something in here I find more fascinating.

48:25.560 --> 48:30.040
They are listing applications as installed.

48:30.040 --> 48:32.120
For example, say Chromium.

48:32.120 --> 48:38.280
They'll say Chromium is installed, there'll even be a link in your menu bar for a launcher.

48:38.280 --> 48:44.560
But when you click it, in the background, Slacks is like mounting an image, a squash

48:44.560 --> 48:50.040
FS file system, setting up paths, getting maybe even the latest binary download, depending

48:50.040 --> 48:53.040
on what it is, and then launching Chromium.

48:53.040 --> 48:55.320
Like it wasn't already in the main instance.

48:55.320 --> 48:57.100
It's just fascinating how they're doing this.

48:57.100 --> 49:02.840
But maybe even more interesting is the fact that the whole damn thing is based on Fluxbox,

49:02.840 --> 49:07.160
and it's a unique and interesting implementation.

49:07.160 --> 49:10.280
They've picked a background that is 100% ACES.

49:10.280 --> 49:15.600
This might be the best Linux desktop background I've ever seen.

49:15.600 --> 49:20.240
It's got a wood picnic table in the foreground, and then some fake artificial grass in the

49:20.240 --> 49:23.640
background, and it makes for a perfect presentation.

49:23.640 --> 49:28.120
You feel like there's a shelf, and the way the lighting works is it draws your eyes down

49:28.120 --> 49:29.120
to the bar.

49:29.120 --> 49:31.880
There's a nice transparent menu at the bottom.

49:31.880 --> 49:37.360
Looks very early Windows 7, minimal Windows 7, with a launcher that comes up that's very

49:37.360 --> 49:41.680
Gnome 3, a grid of icons, and there you'll see the web browser.

49:41.680 --> 49:46.720
If I click that, in the background, it's actually mounting the squash FS file system and then

49:46.720 --> 49:48.800
launching Chromium.

49:48.800 --> 49:54.460
This is a simple, clean, very Windows-esque inspired.

49:54.460 --> 50:02.920
It's like a hybrid of Windows 7 and Windows 10, theming and effects-wise, and you get

50:02.920 --> 50:08.100
minimum stuff, in a way that's very intentional on the Slack's team.

50:08.100 --> 50:15.120
They figure, for a lot of modern computers, you don't really need more than a web browser,

50:15.120 --> 50:21.840
a terminal, and a Debian base, so they figure, flash that on a USB drive, boot it up, despite

50:21.840 --> 50:27.880
its small size, Slack's will provide you a nice graphical user interface, and by default,

50:27.880 --> 50:30.440
the two programs, your browser and your terminal.

50:30.440 --> 50:35.500
You got Debian under the hood, you get the entire ecosystem of Debian, tens of thousands

50:35.500 --> 50:36.500
of pre-built packages.

50:36.500 --> 50:38.620
Yeah, apt just works like normal.

50:38.620 --> 50:44.940
They have a 32-bit, a 64-bit, and then a really fun version that you gave a shot, couldn't

50:44.940 --> 50:49.120
get it working, probably just have to spend a little more time monkeying with it, the

50:49.120 --> 50:50.120
Slack's IPXE version.

50:50.120 --> 50:51.120
Yeah, super handy.

50:51.120 --> 50:55.320
You can just, you know, boot that in over the network and boot it into Slack's.

50:55.320 --> 50:58.720
And what's nice is it loads it all into RAM.

50:58.720 --> 51:02.040
So the whole, I was joking about RAM disk, but the whole damn thing is running out of

51:02.040 --> 51:04.240
a RAM disk booted off of your network.

51:04.240 --> 51:07.180
It seems like a super nice, especially, yeah, if you're just doing everything in Chrome

51:07.180 --> 51:09.840
and a terminal and other machines, this is just a dumb workstation.

51:09.840 --> 51:12.120
Well, and let me pause you with this.

51:12.120 --> 51:16.400
Let's say you had your typical desktop OS.

51:16.400 --> 51:18.800
Maybe it's Windows 10.

51:18.800 --> 51:22.680
Maybe it's Plasma Neon, KDE Neon.

51:22.680 --> 51:26.960
But every now and then, you want a special environment for doing something, something

51:26.960 --> 51:32.000
private or something unique, or you just want, I can sit down at any computer on my network

51:32.000 --> 51:33.600
and I can boot into this environment.

51:33.600 --> 51:35.480
You could do that with the IPXE version.

51:35.480 --> 51:36.480
You see what I'm saying?

51:36.480 --> 51:37.480
Oh yeah, absolutely.

51:37.480 --> 51:41.200
Because if you've got one of those BIOSes that supports choose boot device, like, you

51:41.200 --> 51:45.440
know, mine is like F12, I hit F12 and then I get to choose my boot device.

51:45.440 --> 51:48.320
And one of my options is a Pixie boot server.

51:48.320 --> 51:49.320
Totally.

51:49.320 --> 51:51.280
I could choose that and it would boot off of that, but otherwise it would boot off my

51:51.280 --> 51:54.440
local disk and you could just have that available on your network.

51:54.440 --> 51:55.440
So that's another nice thing.

51:55.440 --> 51:58.560
Yeah, just diagnosing things, fixing stuff, reformatting disks.

51:58.560 --> 52:02.040
Yeah, and it's interesting too to check back in with Slack because we've talked about them

52:02.040 --> 52:06.280
in the past, but last time we talked about them, those guys were basing that thing on

52:06.280 --> 52:07.280
Slackware.

52:07.280 --> 52:09.120
Yeah, totally different.

52:09.120 --> 52:10.120
Totally different approach.

52:10.120 --> 52:14.640
They were going for like a Slackware user-friendly desktop distro.

52:14.640 --> 52:23.800
They've pivoted and now they are a live-only, modern, portable, Floxbox-based Debian distro

52:23.800 --> 52:25.240
that's actually kind of nice.

52:25.240 --> 52:26.240
It is kind of nice.

52:26.240 --> 52:30.560
I can't really put my finger on it, but playing with it today and yesterday, it's just been

52:30.560 --> 52:31.880
an entirely pleasant activity.

52:31.880 --> 52:32.880
Clean, fast.

52:32.880 --> 52:37.280
I don't know if I'll be putting it on my systems permanently, but I'll think of it if I have

52:37.280 --> 52:38.760
a need for this niche.

52:38.760 --> 52:42.760
Yeah, so the Slack team's got some good stuff here.

52:42.760 --> 52:45.920
I was coming in kind of being like, you know, I've used Slack before, nothing really new

52:45.920 --> 52:46.920
to see here.

52:46.920 --> 52:48.480
It's just another point release.

52:48.480 --> 52:49.480
No.

52:49.480 --> 52:51.400
No, they've really done some good stuff here.

52:51.400 --> 52:54.000
And they've got more stuff in the pipeline too.

52:54.000 --> 53:00.360
They have, I guess, one big disclosure we should make is they want legacy boot when

53:00.360 --> 53:01.360
you're using this distro.

53:01.360 --> 53:02.360
Yeah.

53:02.360 --> 53:03.360
Yeah, very much syslinux boot.

53:03.360 --> 53:07.120
I will also say over on their site, they've got a great internals page that describes

53:07.120 --> 53:08.960
a whole bunch about how it's set up.

53:08.960 --> 53:09.960
Oh.

53:09.960 --> 53:10.960
That's not something you see a lot.

53:10.960 --> 53:15.160
You know, maybe buried in a Wiki somewhere, but it is a unique distro in how it's configured

53:15.160 --> 53:17.640
and they're very open and transparent about it.

53:17.640 --> 53:19.300
So to that end, that's where I was going.

53:19.300 --> 53:27.840
So they have a slacks.org, that's S-L-A-X.org for English, E-N, slash next.php.

53:27.840 --> 53:31.920
And if you go to their next.php page, they have, oh, here's what we just released and

53:31.920 --> 53:36.920
they did this site, the slacks 940 came out yesterday, 940.

53:36.920 --> 53:42.680
And then they already have slacks next, which where they talk about we're going to get EFI

53:42.680 --> 53:46.440
support working, we're going to get virtual box support working, we're going to change

53:46.440 --> 53:50.040
some settings in the terminal and we have other things that are coming to the next version

53:50.040 --> 53:51.040
of slacks.

53:51.040 --> 53:56.640
So even though slacks 940 came out yesterday as we record this here show, they've already

53:56.640 --> 53:59.120
up on the website, got what they're working on.

53:59.120 --> 54:02.600
And our number one complaint, EFI support, is already on their radar.

54:02.600 --> 54:03.600
See that's awesome.

54:03.600 --> 54:04.600
It is.

54:04.600 --> 54:08.200
It is because it made it a little challenging to boot on some of my newer laptops, so it's

54:08.200 --> 54:09.840
really good to see them put that in there.

54:09.840 --> 54:15.120
You know, if they had snaps, snap packages baked right in, now that would also be very

54:15.120 --> 54:16.120
handy.

54:16.120 --> 54:19.560
That's good, particularly for a use case like this where you're booting it up fresh

54:19.560 --> 54:22.800
and you need to hit the ground and you just need to get running.

54:22.800 --> 54:28.440
I was really impressed though, came back to slacks kind of expecting this haphazard reboot,

54:28.440 --> 54:35.640
this sort of duct tape and string to get everything working on Debian and instead came away with

54:35.640 --> 54:39.280
one of the more unique desktop Linux experiences I've had in 2018.

54:39.280 --> 54:45.360
Yeah, and it's easy to like, the 64-bit version is 260 megs, so like I can also see myself

54:45.360 --> 54:48.360
just leaving this laying around somewhere in case I need it.

54:48.360 --> 54:49.360
Totally.

54:49.360 --> 54:52.120
Minimac, you bring up a good point of somewhere you'd like to see them go in the future.

54:52.120 --> 54:59.920
Yeah, I would love to see for low specs Chromebooks and on CPUs, I would love to see ARM support.

54:59.920 --> 55:00.920
That would be cool.

55:00.920 --> 55:03.520
That would be, ARM support would be great.

55:03.520 --> 55:05.320
Something like this on the Raspberry Pi with Fluxbox.

55:05.320 --> 55:06.320
Oh yeah.

55:06.320 --> 55:13.600
I don't know why I expected Fluxbox to be animation-free, sort of like no frills, but

55:13.600 --> 55:19.800
even in a software composite environment, the menus fade in and out nicely, the applications

55:19.800 --> 55:23.240
launch, the menu comes up nicely, like everything's polished.

55:23.240 --> 55:28.340
Fluxbox, I think, doesn't get enough appreciation because that's got to be one of the damn best

55:28.340 --> 55:32.040
looking implementations I've seen in a long time, which just tells me that if you just

55:32.040 --> 55:33.840
spend enough time with it, you can get it right.

55:33.840 --> 55:35.080
Yeah, a handsome desktop.

55:35.080 --> 55:36.340
It is indeed.

55:36.340 --> 55:38.240
And it's good to see it getting some coverage.

55:38.240 --> 55:40.700
For Onyx wrote about it as well.

55:40.700 --> 55:45.800
It's based on Debian stable, so if you're more of a Debian testing user, might not necessarily

55:45.800 --> 55:48.320
float your boat, but I sure liked it.

55:48.320 --> 55:53.780
And you know, if you're considering going to XFCE, why not give it a go?

55:53.780 --> 55:54.780
Check it out.

55:54.780 --> 55:55.780
slacks.org.

55:55.780 --> 56:01.040
We'll have a link in the show notes at linuxunplugged.com slash 242.

56:01.040 --> 56:05.340
And if you give it a go or something kind of like this, like did we just miss the mark

56:05.340 --> 56:06.340
a bit?

56:06.340 --> 56:09.440
Is there something like you're like, guys, guys, you've just got to try this out.

56:09.440 --> 56:14.640
Let us know, go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact, oh, that's right, at linuxunplugged.com

56:14.640 --> 56:15.640
slash contact.

56:15.640 --> 56:22.480
We got a new contact form, and the way I've set it up now is it in big all caps with like

56:22.480 --> 56:27.960
brackets and special stuff that I've set up for filtering says somebody responded to Linux

56:27.960 --> 56:29.920
Unplugged has sent you an email, Chris.

56:29.920 --> 56:31.620
Don't miss this one, you dumb arse.

56:31.620 --> 56:32.620
So nice.

56:32.620 --> 56:33.620
Yeah, yeah.

56:33.620 --> 56:34.620
You're taking it seriously.

56:34.620 --> 56:35.920
Taking it very seriously.

56:35.920 --> 56:41.120
So linuxunplugged.com slash contact, as seriously as I take email, because I have effing hate

56:41.120 --> 56:42.120
email.

56:42.120 --> 56:43.120
Amen.

56:43.120 --> 56:46.360
As seriously as I take any frickin email.

56:46.360 --> 56:50.640
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

56:50.640 --> 56:51.640
There you have it.

56:51.640 --> 56:54.960
I think, I guess with that, maybe we'll just leave it at if you want to check out Slack,

56:54.960 --> 56:58.360
slacks9.4 is the one you want if you want it based on Debut with all the goodies we

56:58.360 --> 56:59.600
just talked about.

56:59.600 --> 57:05.900
mp4tools is the mp4 joiner we talked about, and hyper is the terminal that we talked about.

57:05.900 --> 57:09.560
Just a whole bunch of, I just realized a whole bunch of names and picks that we just did,

57:09.560 --> 57:11.040
kind of all smushed together.

57:11.040 --> 57:14.560
Mr. Payne, is there anything else we should leave people with before we get out of here?

57:14.560 --> 57:15.800
I think we covered it today.

57:15.800 --> 57:16.800
I know, I feel good.

57:16.800 --> 57:18.280
We got it all in there.

57:18.280 --> 57:22.220
All right, well go get more Joe and me over at linuxactionnews.com.

57:22.220 --> 57:26.460
You can also go get more of just Joe and his friends at lateknightlinux.com.

57:26.460 --> 57:30.480
More Wes Payne over at techsnap.systems.

57:30.480 --> 57:34.680
You can go get more of producer Michael on his YouTube channel at Tux Digital, and with

57:34.680 --> 57:39.080
all of that, I think we'll wrap it up.

57:39.080 --> 57:44.640
Of course, if you're watching live over at the JBLive site, the Ask Noah program is coming

57:44.640 --> 57:45.640
up.

57:45.640 --> 57:47.060
You're always welcome to join us on a Tuesday.

57:47.060 --> 57:52.600
Go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get our live times, because it is a whole

57:52.600 --> 57:53.980
Linux celebration.

57:53.980 --> 57:57.460
It's Linux Tuesdays over on the jblive.tv live stream.

57:57.460 --> 58:01.600
We start with the unplugged program pre-show, and then we keep on going to Ask Noah, and

58:01.600 --> 58:02.640
we'd love to have you there.

58:02.640 --> 58:03.640
You can follow me.

58:03.640 --> 58:05.040
I'm Chris Elias, the network's at Jupyter Signal.

58:05.040 --> 58:10.000
He's at Wes Payne, linuxunplugged.com, and we'd love to have your feedback at linuxunplugged.com

58:10.000 --> 58:13.140
slash contact, and linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

58:13.140 --> 58:14.140
Thank you for joining us.

58:14.140 --> 58:16.640
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

58:16.640 --> 58:45.440
See ya.

58:45.440 --> 58:49.880
Welcome to BSD Unplugged, your weekly BSD talk show that's too busy getting actual work

58:49.880 --> 58:52.880
done to care about what your silly display server.

58:52.880 --> 58:53.880
My name is Alan.

58:53.880 --> 58:54.880
BSD, guys.

58:54.880 --> 58:55.880
Those bastards.

58:55.880 --> 58:56.880
All right.

58:56.880 --> 59:02.160
So, what do you think we should call this one, guys, because JBot took the day off,

59:02.160 --> 59:04.360
so what do you think?

59:04.360 --> 59:05.520
We got to come up with something good.

59:05.520 --> 59:08.520
Oh, I see Mr. Colonel Linux there in the chat room.

59:08.520 --> 59:10.680
Hello, Colonel Linux.

59:10.680 --> 59:14.440
I was really kind of debating back and forth with Noah while I was at scale.

59:14.440 --> 59:19.320
What am I going to reload onto Hadia's systems in her acupuncture clinic, because I think

59:19.320 --> 59:28.920
she's on 1610 or 1604, I'm not sure, but one is Mate and one is Unity, and it turns out

59:28.920 --> 59:35.080
there's different little issues on each that they would just like resolve, and they would

59:35.080 --> 59:38.840
like it to be the same interface, so that way when the staff use the different computers,

59:38.840 --> 59:39.840
it's all the same.

59:39.840 --> 59:44.040
So, I was like, well, okay, so what distro and what desktop environment do I pick, because

59:44.040 --> 59:48.320
they were on Unity, but I think I'm going to do Plasma as long as it's the one I'm using

59:48.320 --> 59:49.320
is what my thought.

59:49.320 --> 59:50.320
What were you going to say?

59:50.320 --> 59:51.320
Shouldn't you beta test it first?

59:51.320 --> 59:52.320
Yeah.

59:52.320 --> 59:53.320
Oh, yeah.

59:53.320 --> 59:56.120
If you do Plasma, I would suggest checking out Kubuntu 1804.

59:56.120 --> 59:57.120
This is what I was thinking.

59:57.120 --> 59:58.840
There's a lot of polish.

59:58.840 --> 59:59.840
Yeah.

59:59.840 --> 01:00:05.640
Well, actually, not just that, right, but it's going to be Plasma LTS and Ubuntu LTS,

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.120
right?

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.120
And Qt LTS.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.120
Oh, but-

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:13.400
Chris, I've got one word for you, right, to solve your problem.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.400
Mutiny.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.400
I know.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.400
Yeah.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.400
I know.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.400
It crossed my mind.

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.400
It really did.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.760
Hadia has been complaining to me, and it's not that I don't listen.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.040
It's just that I just sort of all kind of collect into a bag of, oh, I got to fix their

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.040
computer problems.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.880
Does she know how to update the packages every month?

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:35.000
Well, she gets the graphical prompt, and I have her do that.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.400
And so, for the most part, all that's been fine, with the exception of she's on those

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:44.760
versions of Ubuntu where they fill up the boot, the slash boot, so about twice a year,

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:49.120
her slash boot fills up on her computers, and then I have to walk her through the auto

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.120
remove and-

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.120
Yeah.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.120
Yeah.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.120
And she just hates that.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.800
So that's another reason to upgrade her, because that's something they finally fixed in Ubuntu.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:57.800
You know, with 18.04-

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.800
That makes sense.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.800
Yeah.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.600
And with 18.04, with all that, with Kubuntu 18.04, all that stuff lining up LTS, seems

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.320
like a pretty safe bet, but we'll see.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.320
The jury is still out.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:09.600
I will do some testing.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:10.600
I'm going to have her-

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:15.280
Also, I'm contributing to Kubuntu 18.04, so that, by itself, should be an example.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.280
Well, there-

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.280
Shh.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.280
Shh.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.280
God.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.280
Anything in particular?

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.280
Anything?

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.280
Just in moral support?

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:28.060
The whole new design, I'm changing a bunch of defaults that I don't like, that they're

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:29.240
willing to listen to me about.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.240
No kidding.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.240
That's great.

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.320
The single click to double click, that's changing.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.320
Yes.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.320
Yes.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.320
I get to remove all the animations.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.320
Oh, ouch.

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.320
Ouch.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.320
But then what would my GPU be doing?

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:55.240
Technically, you could, you could, but then it wouldn't be as good.
