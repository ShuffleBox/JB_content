WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.460
I have discovered a web based virtual machine x86 virtualization in your browser.

00:13.460 --> 00:20.800
It's recompiling x86 to web assembly on the fly and you can spin up distros and of course

00:20.800 --> 00:25.360
like you just heard Windows 98 in the web browser.

00:25.360 --> 00:28.580
It's a proof of concept but it's kind of incredible.

00:28.580 --> 00:32.360
You hipster, I'm running Windows 3.1 over here playing some solitaire.

00:32.360 --> 00:33.360
Oh yeah?

00:33.360 --> 00:36.100
Oh, I gotta try that too.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.100
That's pretty great.

00:37.100 --> 00:39.080
It boots up pretty quick as well.

00:39.080 --> 00:43.520
Taking a look at the GitHub, looks like there's even some rust involved here, Chris.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.840
But I do have one bit of bad news.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.440
No, Plan 9 doesn't work.

00:48.440 --> 00:53.000
We'll put a link in the show notes.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.800
Oh hey friends, welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

01:00.800 --> 01:01.800
My name is Chris.

01:01.800 --> 01:02.880
My name is Wes.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.840
This episode is brought to you by the all new Cloud Guru.

01:05.840 --> 01:09.000
They are the leader in cloud for Linux and other modern tech skills.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.560
They have hundreds of courses, thousands of hands on labs.

01:11.560 --> 01:16.120
So get certified, get hired and get learning at a cloudguru.com.

01:16.120 --> 01:22.120
All right, so this week there's been something that I've been sitting with for a couple of

01:22.120 --> 01:23.120
weeks.

01:23.120 --> 01:27.600
Some old friends of mine of longtime Linux users have taken to the web to pronounce that

01:27.600 --> 01:30.640
Linux is boring.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.160
Linux isn't going anywhere.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.840
Maybe you saw some of those posts recently.

01:34.840 --> 01:39.680
And the funny thing is, I think anybody who's been around for a while, we've seen this commentary

01:39.680 --> 01:42.920
from time to time, almost on a yearly basis.

01:42.920 --> 01:46.840
It's definitely as long as I've been in the Linux community, I've seen this.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.820
And I've never really agreed with the sentiment.

01:48.820 --> 01:54.040
I've always felt like maybe they were just sort of settling down into Linux and they

01:54.040 --> 01:55.040
were getting bored.

01:55.040 --> 01:59.500
But Linux itself, I think the desktop's been getting more interesting than ever recently.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.680
If you keep reading all the announcements and the mailing lists and you follow developers

02:02.680 --> 02:08.400
and you talk to people, you see there's new debates raging, there's new concepts being

02:08.400 --> 02:09.400
tried.

02:09.400 --> 02:14.760
And I think when you keep up with that stuff, you learn that that stuff is still going somewhere.

02:14.760 --> 02:15.760
It's not done.

02:15.760 --> 02:19.760
And maybe because the desktop actually works for getting work done doesn't mean it's boring.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.220
Is that what you're saying, Chris?

02:21.220 --> 02:22.220
That's what I'm saying.

02:22.220 --> 02:26.400
And I think there's some new stuff that's just, some of it just weeks away, it's going

02:26.400 --> 02:27.780
to make Linux better than ever.

02:27.780 --> 02:32.120
And so your unplugged program today is going to go through some of this, specifically through

02:32.120 --> 02:33.940
the lens of Fedora 34.

02:33.940 --> 02:40.560
Because what I see in Fedora 34 right now, which is in development, I see there the future

02:40.560 --> 02:41.740
of the Linux desktop.

02:41.740 --> 02:45.500
And even if you're not, don't worry, even if you're not a Fedora user or even a GNOME

02:45.500 --> 02:52.980
Shell user, I think some of what's landing in 34 is going to find its way into every

02:52.980 --> 02:55.460
Linux distro in the future.

02:55.460 --> 02:58.260
So coming up on the show today, we're going to break down some of those features and tell

02:58.260 --> 03:01.660
you the ones that we think are the most exciting in particular.

03:01.660 --> 03:06.540
This is one of those topics where we have been geeking out and realized we could probably

03:06.540 --> 03:07.540
make a show out of this.

03:07.540 --> 03:11.900
Yeah, I mean, as long as we're re-imaging everything with Fedora and playing with the

03:11.900 --> 03:15.460
latest unreleased GNOME, we better talk about it.

03:15.460 --> 03:18.560
So a lot of this stuff is coming together for Fedora.

03:18.560 --> 03:19.920
It's a lot of work.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.380
Version 33 was great.

03:22.380 --> 03:23.380
It was exciting.

03:23.380 --> 03:27.820
You know, version 33 we talked a lot about because really was bringing ButterFS to the

03:27.820 --> 03:29.860
workstation versions of Fedora.

03:29.860 --> 03:33.420
So we talked a lot about that before, but today we're going to talk about what's coming

03:33.420 --> 03:36.340
not just to 34, but to all the distributions.

03:36.340 --> 03:40.740
So to help us break through that, to help us chew it all and analyze it all, we're going

03:40.740 --> 03:42.140
to bring in a team of experts.

03:42.140 --> 03:44.020
We're going to bring in our virtual lug.

03:44.020 --> 03:45.620
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

03:45.620 --> 03:46.620
Hello, Chris.

03:46.620 --> 03:47.620
Good evening.

03:47.620 --> 03:48.620
Hello.

03:48.620 --> 03:49.620
Namaskara.

03:49.620 --> 03:50.620
Hello.

03:50.620 --> 03:51.620
Hello, everyone.

03:51.620 --> 03:52.620
It's exciting times ahead.

03:52.620 --> 03:55.580
I don't know if any of you have seen some of the sentiments posted online recently that

03:55.580 --> 04:00.020
things are getting a little boring and that GNOME 40 doesn't do anything to change that.

04:00.020 --> 04:06.820
I just completely disagree, and I think we have some very exciting times ahead of us.

04:06.820 --> 04:10.500
I want to say, although I feel like people think I'm exaggerating, but I want to say

04:10.500 --> 04:15.880
potentially the most exciting times we've had on the Linux desktop in general.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.020
I know it's a big statement, but it really feels like we are on the precipice of several

04:19.020 --> 04:20.780
technologies coming together.

04:20.780 --> 04:24.780
It's peak Linux desktop, everybody.

04:24.780 --> 04:26.940
So let's talk about some of this groundwork.

04:26.940 --> 04:29.120
So Fedora 34 is in development right now.

04:29.120 --> 04:33.060
It's supposed to be released towards the end of April.

04:33.060 --> 04:37.300
It will represent the culmination of several important efforts that have been developing

04:37.300 --> 04:40.300
over the years, and we'll talk about some of those.

04:40.300 --> 04:43.620
And that's why I say when you look at 34, you kind of see where the future of desktop

04:43.620 --> 04:47.760
Linux is going, even if you don't run GNOME or Fedora.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.860
And I think you'll find something interesting in all of this.

04:50.860 --> 04:56.060
Essentially, this stuff lands here first in Fedora often and then makes its way out.

04:56.060 --> 04:58.980
And there's an ecosystem effect we're going to talk about as well.

04:58.980 --> 05:04.000
And as he has been known to do, senior manager for desktop at Red Hat Christian Schaller wrote

05:04.000 --> 05:10.300
a detailed blog post about what to look forward to in Fedora Workstation 34, which will have

05:10.300 --> 05:12.740
the first take at a lot of these goodies.

05:12.740 --> 05:17.060
We'll have the full post in the notes if you're curious, and it's definitely worth going through

05:17.060 --> 05:20.740
if you're a Fedora user or a GNOME user or just interested in the future of the desktop.

05:20.740 --> 05:25.260
But we're also going to break down a few things that we think will have the biggest long term

05:25.260 --> 05:27.140
impact on desktop Linux.

05:27.140 --> 05:31.780
Yeah, and I think the number one with a bullet is Wayland.

05:31.780 --> 05:35.680
We've been talking about it for years.

05:35.680 --> 05:43.420
And Wayland is production ready for more use cases than not now in Fedora 34 and for other

05:43.420 --> 05:45.180
distributions here in the future.

05:45.180 --> 05:46.500
It took a little while to get there.

05:46.500 --> 05:49.860
Of course, you had to get accelerated ExWayland support working.

05:49.860 --> 05:54.220
It took partnering up with Nvidia to get them to start working on a driver that works with

05:54.220 --> 05:56.660
Wayland, which isn't complete yet.

05:56.660 --> 06:00.440
It took figuring out ways to share screen and do things securely.

06:00.440 --> 06:04.780
There's a lot of engineering work that went into make Wayland actually adoptable by the

06:04.780 --> 06:06.220
wider community.

06:06.220 --> 06:12.000
Of course, some of that work was in ExWayland, including some work going on for headless

06:12.000 --> 06:17.100
display support, which is kind of a critical feature for people who want to run a desktop

06:17.100 --> 06:21.460
instance on a server in the cloud or do some fancy VNC or RDP tasks.

06:21.460 --> 06:26.000
And I think it's exactly that area where that's what we mean with Wayland and that ecosystem

06:26.000 --> 06:30.420
getting to production ready is that some of those less common or more advanced use cases,

06:30.420 --> 06:33.140
those are finally getting ironed out.

06:33.140 --> 06:37.560
And it required some plumbing be developed to make it all possible.

06:37.560 --> 06:42.420
And that's where Pipewire came together that makes doing things like packaging applications

06:42.420 --> 06:48.020
securely with Flatpak possible while also enabling video and screen sharing on Wayland.

06:48.020 --> 06:52.160
And then bridging the gap between the different audio subsystems too now.

06:52.160 --> 06:57.580
So Pipewire, it's another big ticket item that is shipping in Fedora Workstation 34.

06:57.580 --> 07:02.080
Most of you know it's an engine to handle video streams and it became also an engine

07:02.080 --> 07:04.240
to deal with audio.

07:04.240 --> 07:08.340
In Workstation 34, the plan is for Pipewire to take over that audio role.

07:08.340 --> 07:10.780
That has been kind of more in development phase.

07:10.780 --> 07:14.940
It is something Wes and I have been playing with and I've had a lot of good experiences

07:14.940 --> 07:16.260
so far with it.

07:16.260 --> 07:21.200
Pipewire, it does audio management more like you would be used to using a tool on the Mac

07:21.200 --> 07:22.960
like Audio Hijack Pro.

07:22.960 --> 07:29.900
It's more of the Mac style, but still compatible with Pulse and jack audio and simpler in a

07:29.900 --> 07:31.100
lot of ways.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.700
And it's been seamless in my testing.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.340
What do you mean by Mac style?

07:34.340 --> 07:40.060
I think I agree, but for folks who maybe don't ever run a Mac, what does Mac style mean?

07:40.060 --> 07:42.500
So you'd actually probably be better at explaining it.

07:42.500 --> 07:45.820
So it's like the opposite of the way you connect devices in jack, right?

07:45.820 --> 07:50.260
In Pipewire, they're almost on by default, you know what I'm saying?

07:50.260 --> 07:56.060
Yeah, I guess once you're using some of the jack tooling that lets you do audio routing,

07:56.060 --> 07:59.560
you can see everything on your system, whether the client is using jack or the client is

07:59.560 --> 08:01.100
using Pulse audio.

08:01.100 --> 08:06.660
It's all integrated and you can connect arbitrary applications together without those apps having

08:06.660 --> 08:08.820
to opt into the system.

08:08.820 --> 08:13.780
Whereas right now, you kind of have to be using jack or do some complicated tricks with

08:13.780 --> 08:15.220
Pulse audio bridges.

08:15.220 --> 08:17.620
And either way, it's not intuitive.

08:17.620 --> 08:21.120
And additionally, on top of that, Wes, it makes it just really simpler from just the

08:21.120 --> 08:22.860
way that I think users expect things to work.

08:22.860 --> 08:26.780
Like you launch, say, VLC, VLC shows up in one of these tools and you can just connect

08:26.780 --> 08:31.020
audio in and out the way you would expect to be able to just connect blocks and you're

08:31.020 --> 08:34.580
using established jack tools to do it.

08:34.580 --> 08:39.460
It's really cool how they've, they kind of managed to re-engineer this section of Linux,

08:39.460 --> 08:42.420
but keep it in a way that is compatible with the existing tools.

08:42.420 --> 08:47.540
And so with the approach they've taken and it's really down to how they've interacted

08:47.540 --> 08:52.160
with the community, it's come down to how they've managed people and how they've managed

08:52.160 --> 08:56.040
these different, I guess you could call them stakeholders.

08:56.040 --> 08:59.780
They've gotten people excited and participating in the process.

08:59.780 --> 09:03.860
And so even commercial vendors are testing for pipeline compatibility now.

09:03.860 --> 09:08.100
There's been, they've created a momentum because they've worked with people.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.420
It hasn't been hostile, it's been collaborative.

09:11.420 --> 09:17.060
And so it's moving really rapidly and it's going to debut in 34, but I would think by

09:17.060 --> 09:21.680
this time next year, distros will be shipping it, just all of them.

09:21.680 --> 09:22.760
It's kind of fascinating.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.540
It's sort of a slow play, right?

09:24.540 --> 09:28.620
It's tough to reintroduce a new sound system, take things over on the Linux desktop.

09:28.620 --> 09:33.860
I mean, look at how difficult pulse audio was and it's kind of still a little controversial,

09:33.860 --> 09:34.860
right?

09:34.860 --> 09:39.780
I mean, we've all got feelings about pulse, but Pipewire seems to be doing it the right

09:39.780 --> 09:41.460
way, getting compatibility in place.

09:41.460 --> 09:45.460
Now of course, a lot of this stuff is still very much a work in progress.

09:45.460 --> 09:49.460
And if you find applications that use some of the niche features of say, pulse audio

09:49.460 --> 09:54.500
or Jack, okay, maybe you run into some edge cases where it doesn't work just yet.

09:54.500 --> 10:00.200
But as those get ironed out, I mean, Pipewire seems to be rock solid at the foundations.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.780
That's what's so impressive is even with all the warnings about like, hey, this is new.

10:03.780 --> 10:05.740
Hey, we're just trying it out.

10:05.740 --> 10:10.820
We've been kind of abusing it, Chris, and it just keeps working.

10:10.820 --> 10:14.180
Let's fast forward to Flatpaks, Wes, because it kind of all stacks.

10:14.180 --> 10:20.100
You've got Wayland and then Pipewire is a sort of a necessary enabling technology for

10:20.100 --> 10:22.300
the Wayland reality.

10:22.300 --> 10:27.220
And then Flatpaks, they also play a role with the way their security model works.

10:27.220 --> 10:30.620
And Pipewire enables some functionality there as well.

10:30.620 --> 10:32.500
They're all kind of connected together.

10:32.500 --> 10:37.500
And there's been a lot of work behind the scenes for the last year to try to shore up

10:37.500 --> 10:42.260
the RHEL and Fedora infrastructure for Flatpaks and the overall experience.

10:42.260 --> 10:47.500
And Christian writes about how they're moving forward to eventually make Flatpaks the primary

10:47.500 --> 10:50.220
packaging format that Fedora users consume.

10:50.220 --> 10:52.740
I want to come back to that in a moment.

10:52.740 --> 10:59.560
But in that effort, they're making a lot of things simpler and easier for maintainers.

10:59.560 --> 11:04.560
And they're working on introducing a really solid incremental update method for Flatpaks,

11:04.560 --> 11:09.340
like you see on Flat Hub, that makes them much faster and quicker to update.

11:09.340 --> 11:13.820
And that, I think, is also going to have wide-ranging benefits.

11:13.820 --> 11:18.460
That Flatpak work they're doing here for the future of Fedora is going to improve the Flatpak

11:18.460 --> 11:21.460
situation for distributions like elementary OS eventually.

11:21.460 --> 11:22.460
Boy, yeah.

11:22.460 --> 11:26.580
I think getting performance right, making a really solid user experience, if you're

11:26.580 --> 11:32.580
going to become the next standard of packaging, kind of the low bar right there, right?

11:32.580 --> 11:33.580
All right.

11:33.580 --> 11:34.580
But hold up.

11:34.580 --> 11:39.140
Red alert here on, again, I know I mentioned this on the show once before, but are we just

11:39.140 --> 11:44.860
all of a sudden comfortable with the idea that we're going to replace the native packages

11:44.860 --> 11:49.820
on the system and start shipping desktop-level applications as Flatpaks?

11:49.820 --> 11:53.380
Because I seem to recall it was a pretty big issue when the idea was that it might be snaps

11:53.380 --> 11:54.660
on Ubuntu.

11:54.660 --> 11:59.900
So I'm curious where the mumble room stands on this one and why I feel like I'm not seeing

11:59.900 --> 12:01.740
the outcry with Flatpak.

12:01.740 --> 12:03.260
Anybody have thoughts on that?

12:03.260 --> 12:04.260
Yeah.

12:04.260 --> 12:08.900
I think one of the reasons why we tend to see, why we're seeing a little bit of a different

12:08.900 --> 12:15.860
attitude here is that the Flatpak ecosystem generally puts the user in control of their

12:15.860 --> 12:23.800
workflows and their sources and their management of the software, which I think the broader

12:23.800 --> 12:31.300
Linux community prefers over admittedly the simpler user experience, the more continually

12:31.300 --> 12:36.580
updated but slightly out of control model that the snaps offered.

12:36.580 --> 12:42.320
And on top of that, there was a lot of specific outreach done in the Flatpak ecosystem to

12:42.320 --> 12:47.260
make sure the technologies that were being leveraged to do sandboxing and things like

12:47.260 --> 12:50.260
that were not distro specific.

12:50.260 --> 12:56.140
And that was a misstep that Canonical did early on with Snap where it required Ubuntu

12:56.140 --> 13:00.300
app armor as opposed to the standard app armor that ships in the Linux kernel for all the

13:00.300 --> 13:01.620
other distributions.

13:01.620 --> 13:03.060
That is something I hear a lot.

13:03.060 --> 13:07.020
And again, not every distribution ships a mandatory access control system.

13:07.020 --> 13:13.060
A lot of them basically flat out hate mandatory access control systems despite the fact that

13:13.060 --> 13:14.580
they're very valuable.

13:14.580 --> 13:21.820
And so if your desktop application sandbox mechanism hard depends on a mandatory access

13:21.820 --> 13:27.660
control system, be it SC Linux app armor or Ubuntu app armor, then you're toast.

13:27.660 --> 13:31.740
It's not going to actually serve that purpose so people feel like you're taking away control

13:31.740 --> 13:36.260
without giving any benefit because for the vast majority of people outside of the Ubuntu

13:36.260 --> 13:38.340
sphere, it's actually worse.

13:38.340 --> 13:39.340
Right.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.260
Actually, I want to let Colonel get in on that point.

13:41.260 --> 13:45.260
Colonel, do you sense that the Snap store plays a role in this?

13:45.260 --> 13:50.480
Yeah, I think that there was a certain amount of backlash against snaps because the source

13:50.480 --> 13:54.180
for the snaps is controlled by Canonical.

13:54.180 --> 14:00.840
I think that it was twofold, one, similar to what Conan was saying is that it's controlled

14:00.840 --> 14:01.840
by one person.

14:01.840 --> 14:09.060
But I think there was also a certain amount of with snaps, not invented here in reverse

14:09.060 --> 14:15.740
almost where people were lashing out against it because it came from Canonical.

14:15.740 --> 14:18.660
And I don't think that's a fair reason to lash out against them.

14:18.660 --> 14:19.660
It's a reality though.

14:19.660 --> 14:20.660
Yeah, it's a reality.

14:20.660 --> 14:24.780
And I think that Conan actually summed up a lot of what I was going to say.

14:24.780 --> 14:28.660
I think your point is well made that there is a certain amount of pushback that they

14:28.660 --> 14:31.220
get just simply because it is Canonical.

14:31.220 --> 14:37.980
Minimac, so you had a listener in the Luplug join and talk about his full Flatpak lifestyle

14:37.980 --> 14:41.580
where he went all in on Flatpaks and there is a bit of a disadvantage.

14:41.580 --> 14:42.580
There is indeed.

14:42.580 --> 14:46.640
So it was like two or three weeks ago, I don't even remember, all of a sudden he was talking

14:46.640 --> 14:51.420
about the size of his system, only the system, not talking about his private data.

14:51.420 --> 14:54.780
And his system grew to over 30 gigabytes.

14:54.780 --> 14:55.780
And I was like, what?

14:55.780 --> 14:57.300
I never had a system like that.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.940
And then he told us that he was a heavy Flatpak user.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.020
So his system grew and grew and grew.

15:02.020 --> 15:06.320
So I'm not really a fan to replace the normal package system by that because these Flatpaks

15:06.320 --> 15:11.920
or snaps or two, they come with a lot of data and you don't really need it.

15:11.920 --> 15:17.460
If you have a native package manager, you don't need all these Flatpaks, I think.

15:17.460 --> 15:18.460
True.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.500
You really notice that when you're setting things up, just as I was playing with 34,

15:21.500 --> 15:26.860
I did set up, say, SnapD and I was like, oh yeah, right, I got to install the whole Snap

15:26.860 --> 15:27.860
base world.

15:27.860 --> 15:31.180
Yeah, FlatHub is getting really nice too.

15:31.180 --> 15:35.740
Not that the SnapCraft tools aren't nice on their website, but FlatHub has some clear

15:35.740 --> 15:42.500
momentum of packaging applications that are appealing to users, much like Snaps did early

15:42.500 --> 15:43.500
on.

15:43.500 --> 15:44.940
Now that seems to have transitioned over there.

15:44.940 --> 15:48.860
And going back to Fedora 34, one of the things they're going to be doing potentially, and

15:48.860 --> 15:54.280
I think it is going to happen, is they're going to add FlatHub as a third party repository

15:54.280 --> 15:56.360
if you enable that as an option.

15:56.360 --> 15:59.420
Sort of like, it reminds me of like, it's almost like another RPM fusion now.

15:59.420 --> 16:00.820
It's just the next generation, yeah.

16:00.820 --> 16:02.640
Yeah, and it's looking really good.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.600
But okay, so let's get back to what's coming.

16:04.600 --> 16:08.980
So also one of the things you're going to see land in 34, which will eventually impact

16:08.980 --> 16:12.900
a lot of distributions, but this one's going to trickle out a little slower, is GNOME Shell

16:12.900 --> 16:13.900
40.

16:13.900 --> 16:19.420
Yeah, of course, with the kind of big revamp of the GNOME 3 user interface.

16:19.420 --> 16:23.140
This was a collaborative effort between a lot of the GNOME 3 stakeholders, with Alan

16:23.140 --> 16:25.980
Day representing Red Hat.

16:25.980 --> 16:31.340
But it was also an effort by the GNOME design community to really up their game.

16:31.340 --> 16:35.780
And interestingly, as part of the development process this time around, the GNOME Foundation

16:35.780 --> 16:41.140
paid a professional company to do user testing on the proposed changes and some of the alternatives,

16:41.140 --> 16:44.780
which is why we've been talking about it, which feels like already forever, right?

16:44.780 --> 16:46.740
And it hasn't even been released yet.

16:46.740 --> 16:52.980
The thing is, is this, because I think in part, the team was kind of clever calling

16:52.980 --> 16:55.020
it 40.

16:55.020 --> 17:00.260
Because what I am seeing, and we're going to have lots of links in the show notes, is

17:00.260 --> 17:03.060
this almost ecosystem effect.

17:03.060 --> 17:09.260
That because the GNOME Shell project is going with this big number, all of these other projects

17:09.260 --> 17:14.180
are sort of stepping up, and we'll cover some of them, they're stepping up to get included

17:14.180 --> 17:15.180
in this release.

17:15.180 --> 17:20.300
Because it's kind of a major milestone, and that turns out to be a pretty significant

17:20.300 --> 17:23.060
motivator for some free software developers.

17:23.060 --> 17:26.180
And one of the advantages we're having with Fedora, and that's why we're using the lens

17:26.180 --> 17:31.340
of Fedora for this episode, is they just don't do a lot of tweaking to the GNOME user interface.

17:31.340 --> 17:36.900
Which means what you get in 34 is essentially what the main new GNOME experience is, and

17:36.900 --> 17:38.220
that's what we wanted to get hands-on with.

17:38.220 --> 17:40.580
Yeah, just a nice upstream snapshot.

17:40.580 --> 17:41.580
Yeah.

17:41.580 --> 17:45.220
And you know, there was some discussion, like Wes said earlier on the show, specifically

17:45.220 --> 17:48.860
around the multi-monitor stuff, but I think we made some fair points there.

17:48.860 --> 17:54.680
And Christian actually says that some early versions did lead to long-term fans of how

17:54.680 --> 17:57.740
multi-monitor support worked in GNOME 3 to be concerned.

17:57.740 --> 18:02.900
Carl, I think he just called you old there.

18:02.900 --> 18:05.860
That is definitely a reference to the conversation we had on the show.

18:05.860 --> 18:09.860
But he said, be assured that multi-monitor is a critical use case, in our opinion, and

18:09.860 --> 18:13.180
something we've been looking at and will keep improving.

18:13.180 --> 18:17.420
Another area that's coming that's going to matter a lot is input is going into its own

18:17.420 --> 18:20.020
thread now in GNOME 40.

18:20.020 --> 18:23.260
And that means that you're going to get a smoother input experience with your mouse

18:23.260 --> 18:25.540
and your keyboard when the system is under load.

18:25.540 --> 18:30.180
So you're not going to get mouse stall, which I have complained about before on Wayland.

18:30.180 --> 18:32.060
That's been cleaned up as well.

18:32.060 --> 18:35.460
That stuff will land for all of you eventually.

18:35.460 --> 18:43.360
But this rollout of 40 has pushed these app developers and even library developers forward.

18:43.360 --> 18:47.700
You're seeing projects like Lib Handy get a big release for 40.

18:47.700 --> 18:49.940
Mudder has gotten major improvements for 40.

18:49.940 --> 18:55.340
Epiphany has a whole new really, really beautiful tab system that I think should go everywhere

18:55.340 --> 18:57.780
in GNOME Shell that they're rolling out.

18:57.780 --> 19:02.300
And a lot more than I can list are just getting things ready for GNOME 40.

19:02.300 --> 19:08.700
So even if your distro won't ship the shell itself, the GTK ecosystem is getting a nice

19:08.700 --> 19:10.040
improvement here.

19:10.040 --> 19:13.120
A lot of these apps are getting ready for GTK 4 as well.

19:13.120 --> 19:17.020
And a lot of them in their blog posts, well, not a lot, but some of them in their blog

19:17.020 --> 19:21.620
posts are even committing to GTK 4 and GNOME 41.

19:21.620 --> 19:24.340
There seems to be a lot of momentum there right now.

19:24.340 --> 19:32.060
I will have links to one, two, three, four, five, six different examples of projects that

19:32.060 --> 19:39.260
are shoring things up for GNOME 40, including, I'm happy to report, OBS Studio on Wayland

19:39.260 --> 19:42.940
using Pipewire packaged up as a Flatpak, which I tried out this morning.

19:42.940 --> 19:44.740
The future is here.

19:44.740 --> 19:45.980
Yeah, it works.

19:45.980 --> 19:48.620
It does only full screen capture right now.

19:48.620 --> 19:52.500
So you can't on Wayland capture a specific window.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.900
But if you had like a second monitor, whatever you put on that second monitor, you could

19:55.900 --> 19:57.940
then capture with OBS.

19:57.940 --> 20:00.340
It works though, using Pipewire.

20:00.340 --> 20:01.340
Yes.

20:01.340 --> 20:04.240
And it's, I mean, like, think about all the plumbing.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.940
Same thing with a lot of these improvements, right?

20:05.940 --> 20:07.700
Like moving the mouse stuff to a separate thread.

20:07.700 --> 20:10.520
Okay, that sounds like, how is this just happening?

20:10.520 --> 20:12.700
Same with capturing, you know, full screen capture here.

20:12.700 --> 20:16.660
But there's been a lot of internals that had to get reworked, thought out, designed, carefully

20:16.660 --> 20:20.140
constructed and integrated together to make that happen.

20:20.140 --> 20:23.120
That is for sure, Mr. Payne, and it's really cool to see it all coming together.

20:23.120 --> 20:27.900
So what we decided to do, though, is instead of just read about it, we wanted to get hands

20:27.900 --> 20:28.900
on with it.

20:28.900 --> 20:33.840
We wanted to try some of this stuff and walk away with some notes for you and give you

20:33.840 --> 20:35.720
some hands on experience and where things are at.

20:35.720 --> 20:40.220
And we'll do all of that in just a moment.

20:40.220 --> 20:42.260
lino.com slash unplugged.

20:42.260 --> 20:47.160
Go there to get $100 for 60 days on a new account.

20:47.160 --> 20:51.380
And of course, you support the show, but $100 means you can really try out all the stuff

20:51.380 --> 20:52.680
we talk about.

20:52.680 --> 20:57.100
Whenever you hear us have any kind of like project that we've set up on the show for

20:57.100 --> 21:02.960
like a segment or to have the chat room pound on, we always deploy it on the note because

21:02.960 --> 21:04.860
we know it's going to handle the traffic.

21:04.860 --> 21:08.020
And there's nothing like a load of putting several hundred people on a system all at

21:08.020 --> 21:09.020
once.

21:09.020 --> 21:12.940
But personally, I know it's going to hold up because we've done it over and over again.

21:12.940 --> 21:15.980
Linode's infrastructure is legit.

21:15.980 --> 21:18.920
They've been around forever, so they know how to do it really well.

21:18.920 --> 21:23.580
And I have confidence because they're in this for the love of Linux.

21:23.580 --> 21:26.780
And I don't mean that as just like a cheesy thing to say.

21:26.780 --> 21:28.320
That's why they do this.

21:28.320 --> 21:31.420
That's why they started in 2003.

21:31.420 --> 21:34.460
There's other companies out there that do this, but they do it because they've been

21:34.460 --> 21:39.740
VC funded and they've identified a good market to go after and they have a solid go to market

21:39.740 --> 21:41.340
strategy.

21:41.340 --> 21:43.060
And that's fine.

21:43.060 --> 21:46.820
Linode did it because they love Linux, which is the same reason I'm sitting behind this

21:46.820 --> 21:54.620
microphone and it gives me a solid trust in my infrastructure running on Linode servers.

21:54.620 --> 21:58.460
And then I see it in subtle ways when I use their cloud manager or when I interact with

21:58.460 --> 22:01.120
anyone at Linode.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.660
That has been a fun experience just personally.

22:03.660 --> 22:04.660
I see it.

22:04.660 --> 22:07.660
I also see it just through the service itself.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.720
And I love that they have all the different distributions that I might want to play with

22:10.720 --> 22:14.860
because part of why I like Linode is I do experiment with stuff.

22:14.860 --> 22:16.260
It's a good learning platform.

22:16.260 --> 22:17.740
It's a good experimentation platform.

22:17.740 --> 22:19.340
It's a good testing platform.

22:19.340 --> 22:22.180
And obviously, I think it's a good production platform.

22:22.180 --> 22:25.980
But I love that they have Alpine, they have Arch, they have Santos, they have Debian,

22:25.980 --> 22:30.620
they have Fedora, they have OpenSeus, they have the Seuses, they have the Ubuntu's.

22:30.620 --> 22:34.740
They have all of that stuff there and they'll even kind of walk you through custom loading

22:34.740 --> 22:37.860
an image onto a box, which I've actually done.

22:37.860 --> 22:41.740
I've taken essentially a virtual machine image and uploaded it there and got it working.

22:41.740 --> 22:44.940
And it's a few steps, but they walk you through it all.

22:44.940 --> 22:46.660
It's incredible they even let you do that.

22:46.660 --> 22:48.460
And they're independently owned too.

22:48.460 --> 22:52.220
I like that as well because so is Jupiter Broadcasting.

22:52.220 --> 22:54.140
We share that in common.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.320
We've been going now for a long time.

22:56.320 --> 23:00.860
We've really kind of honed in on what we do and that's what we just really focus on and

23:00.860 --> 23:02.940
we try to do the hell out of it.

23:02.940 --> 23:05.140
And we started because we love Linux.

23:05.140 --> 23:08.240
And that is, you know what they call that?

23:08.240 --> 23:09.240
They call that synergy.

23:09.240 --> 23:13.100
And I think a lot of you listening can identify with a lot of those key points too.

23:13.100 --> 23:16.820
So that $100 kind of just takes it over, right, makes it just kind of perfect.

23:16.820 --> 23:19.940
Because then you can really try and experiment with this stuff that I've been talking about

23:19.940 --> 23:20.980
for a while.

23:20.980 --> 23:25.860
And I think you'll learn that it's great for any use case, testing, learning and production.

23:25.860 --> 23:28.460
And they have rigs to match at every single price level.

23:28.460 --> 23:32.300
They're 30% to 50% cheaper than any of the major cloud providers.

23:32.300 --> 23:33.300
It's fantastic.

23:33.300 --> 23:37.100
So go check them out and see what I've been saying and support the show all in one go.

23:37.100 --> 23:40.780
Linode.com slash unplugged and a big thank you to Linode for sponsoring the unplugged

23:40.780 --> 23:46.620
program Linode.com slash unplugged.

23:46.620 --> 23:52.500
So we decided to go hands on with all this stuff and Wes, you and I went off to our separate

23:52.500 --> 23:57.140
spaces, didn't share any notes beforehand.

23:57.140 --> 24:02.100
And I think maybe both of us ran into a couple of gotchas, but curious to hear what your

24:02.100 --> 24:03.100
thoughts were.

24:03.100 --> 24:06.940
As usual, we should probably mention like, this is still in beta, things are still getting

24:06.940 --> 24:11.800
ironed out, you might run into some issues if you go off into the weeds.

24:11.800 --> 24:16.620
But I chose to replace the machine I have been using mostly just sort of like a separate

24:16.620 --> 24:21.180
second workstation away from my work stuff that's just for like gaming, hanging out playing

24:21.180 --> 24:22.180
around with Linux.

24:22.180 --> 24:24.940
And I had been running Pop OS 2004.

24:24.940 --> 24:31.060
So not, you know, not cutting edge, but, but not old, I've been enjoying Popshell on there.

24:31.060 --> 24:34.260
It's been pretty nice GNOME experience.

24:34.260 --> 24:41.180
But wow, I, I was just kind of, I was blown away when I put 34 on there because it just,

24:41.180 --> 24:43.140
it really felt like a different machine.

24:43.140 --> 24:45.300
It was, it was so much faster.

24:45.300 --> 24:50.000
And I don't know how much of it was really just like, real speed, but the perception,

24:50.000 --> 24:53.740
the changes in how the animations happen, the interactivity of the system.

24:53.740 --> 24:56.220
Well, you're going from X to Wayland in that transition.

24:56.220 --> 24:59.620
Yeah, that's kind of why I wanted to do it because I have Wayland on other machines around

24:59.620 --> 25:00.620
here.

25:00.620 --> 25:04.660
But that one had been just sort of reserved as the last bastion of X in my house anyway.

25:04.660 --> 25:05.660
Yeah, yeah.

25:05.660 --> 25:08.180
Yeah, it is way faster.

25:08.180 --> 25:10.540
That is something that I want to talk more about.

25:10.540 --> 25:15.980
But I think we you had you had success with gestures and my gestures didn't work at all.

25:15.980 --> 25:16.980
Is that right?

25:16.980 --> 25:17.980
Okay, yeah.

25:17.980 --> 25:22.020
I mean, there's maybe controversial, not something I've really traditionally used, but I felt

25:22.020 --> 25:25.940
like I needed to give it a try because that's one of the highlights of the work that's been

25:25.940 --> 25:27.460
going on.

25:27.460 --> 25:32.540
And this is just on a sort of beefy laptop, but nothing special, not a brilliant trackpad

25:32.540 --> 25:33.740
or anything fancy.

25:33.740 --> 25:35.540
They were really nice.

25:35.540 --> 25:36.940
I think I'm going to keep using them.

25:36.940 --> 25:42.820
I mean, any system that's running GNOME, you know, GNOME 40 or above, super handy.

25:42.820 --> 25:47.860
You can just swipe up or down to sort of go out into the expanded view or not go get a

25:47.860 --> 25:52.520
quick overview of everything or if you want to swipe to go easily switch applications,

25:52.520 --> 25:53.520
that's nice.

25:53.520 --> 25:56.480
And then you've got swiping left to right to go between your workspaces, which is super

25:56.480 --> 25:57.480
handy.

25:57.480 --> 26:01.220
I don't have to lift my hands up, go find control alt and the arrow key.

26:01.220 --> 26:06.180
It was just it was really smooth to you know, like on a kind of crummy trackpad on Linux,

26:06.180 --> 26:10.020
my expectations were honestly low, definitely low.

26:10.020 --> 26:12.620
I sort of figured it'd be kind of stuttery or laggy.

26:12.620 --> 26:17.180
But no, and I could just swipe back and forth and it felt like using a fancy tablet.

26:17.180 --> 26:18.900
Hey, that's nice.

26:18.900 --> 26:19.900
Yeah.

26:19.900 --> 26:25.340
So I'm curious now you got so you're coming from a curated GNOME experience with POP.

26:25.340 --> 26:27.660
You've obviously got a plasma install.

26:27.660 --> 26:35.100
And now you're on GNOME Shell 40 with this new overview layout with the gesture support.

26:35.100 --> 26:36.500
Which one are you preferring the most?

26:36.500 --> 26:41.380
Okay, well, on 34 beta, you know, I'd mostly just been playing around with things.

26:41.380 --> 26:42.940
I hadn't got it totally configured yet.

26:42.940 --> 26:49.340
So it was, it felt a little Spartan compared to the curated POP experience.

26:49.340 --> 26:53.080
But that's okay, you know, with like a little theming, a little bit of love, installing

26:53.080 --> 26:56.820
a couple plugins, maybe I think it's gonna get there.

26:56.820 --> 27:02.140
I do still like a lot of what the POP Shell and the Tiling integrations and I think long

27:02.140 --> 27:05.840
term on a production machine, I might want to add that back.

27:05.840 --> 27:08.780
But I like the changes in 40.

27:08.780 --> 27:09.780
I think it's good.

27:09.780 --> 27:11.700
It felt like a very friendly, easy to use desktop.

27:11.700 --> 27:14.300
I liked, I mean, even just without thinking about it.

27:14.300 --> 27:18.100
You know, I've read through the articles, I've played with it before in a VM, but I

27:18.100 --> 27:19.100
didn't have to worry about that.

27:19.100 --> 27:22.380
I didn't have to walk myself through like, oh, yeah, right, this is what changed.

27:22.380 --> 27:24.900
I just sat down and used it and it felt good.

27:24.900 --> 27:31.100
Yeah, in my experience on a laptop, this horizontal layout that they have now and with

27:31.100 --> 27:34.980
gestures when you have them, it's really, really efficient.

27:34.980 --> 27:38.460
Because the gestures, your hands, if you can, obviously you can invoke them with the keyboard

27:38.460 --> 27:40.280
if your hands are on the keyboard.

27:40.280 --> 27:43.500
But it's nice to have an option if your hand is on the mouse.

27:43.500 --> 27:47.900
And on a trackpad, it's sort of just this effortless swipe motion.

27:47.900 --> 27:51.940
It almost feels like you're casting the windows on your screen with the swipe to begin with.

27:51.940 --> 27:52.940
It's natural.

27:52.940 --> 27:53.940
Yes, it's very physical.

27:53.940 --> 27:54.940
Yeah.

27:54.940 --> 27:55.940
And it's nice.

27:55.940 --> 28:01.780
And then you can fly through that interface really fast and rearrange windows super quick.

28:01.780 --> 28:05.340
My concern is still about having multiple screens and vertical screens still remain.

28:05.340 --> 28:11.740
But on the laptop experience, boy, is it nice, it is really, really great.

28:11.740 --> 28:15.620
So I did my deployment on my X1 Carbon.

28:15.620 --> 28:18.500
Felt good to be back on Fedora on the X1 Carbon.

28:18.500 --> 28:21.380
And you've been previously running Arch on there, right?

28:21.380 --> 28:22.740
Yes, with Plasma.

28:22.740 --> 28:25.300
So it's all still all recent software.

28:25.300 --> 28:26.300
Right.

28:26.300 --> 28:28.300
Man, is it tight.

28:28.300 --> 28:31.060
I don't really consider that a fast machine.

28:31.060 --> 28:34.380
But yeah, but it's really the whole package.

28:34.380 --> 28:37.980
WipeWire comes in, it's seamless, it's transparent.

28:37.980 --> 28:38.980
They've nailed it.

28:38.980 --> 28:42.620
I think the community is going to be comfortable adopting this.

28:42.620 --> 28:45.980
And what I have used in production, like I said earlier, I like it a lot.

28:45.980 --> 28:48.740
Firefox 86 is part of this mix.

28:48.740 --> 28:50.980
86 looks great.

28:50.980 --> 28:52.540
It's super smooth and fast.

28:52.540 --> 28:56.460
The Fedora 34 version runs under Wayland.

28:56.460 --> 28:57.980
And it's great.

28:57.980 --> 28:59.860
It renders even nicer and smoother.

28:59.860 --> 29:03.600
I mean, the bottom line here, what Wes and I are saying is this new technology stuff

29:03.600 --> 29:06.820
is coming together and it's fast.

29:06.820 --> 29:08.780
All these improvements are equaling speed.

29:08.780 --> 29:14.980
We've just gotten a bunch of nice new things and it's making stuff faster and more secure.

29:14.980 --> 29:19.940
Wayland and all of the hard work that went into making everything work great on it, which

29:19.940 --> 29:26.940
has been a Herculean task, is paying off now in major ways.

29:26.940 --> 29:30.300
It's at a stage now, and this is going to be a different benchmark for each of us.

29:30.300 --> 29:34.500
But for me, it's at a stage now where I want to run it.

29:34.500 --> 29:37.460
I prefer to use Wayland.

29:37.460 --> 29:41.020
It's not just your sort of incentive to try all the hot new shiny software regardless

29:41.020 --> 29:44.160
of if it works, but like you want it because of the features, right?

29:44.160 --> 29:49.380
It's part of now how I set up my machine to have the best, smoothest experience, to make

29:49.380 --> 29:52.620
it feel like the investment in my X1 Carbon was worth it.

29:52.620 --> 29:54.300
It's not being forced on me.

29:54.300 --> 29:59.500
I am electing now to use Wayland and I really don't have stability issues either.

29:59.500 --> 30:00.700
It's a different bar for each of us.

30:00.700 --> 30:05.140
I know some of you NVIDIA users are sitting there going, nice to be you, Chris, but it'll

30:05.140 --> 30:06.140
get there for you too.

30:06.140 --> 30:08.660
It's going to maybe be until the summer, but it's going to get there.

30:08.660 --> 30:12.260
But my bar has been reached and I'm all in on Wayland now.

30:12.260 --> 30:16.860
I have no compelling reason not to use it on my personal systems between as long as

30:16.860 --> 30:20.700
I stick with AMD graphics and Intel graphics.

30:20.700 --> 30:27.940
But all of that, that whole stack coming together makes my X1 Carbon feel like a super fast

30:27.940 --> 30:28.940
machine.

30:28.940 --> 30:32.060
X4 is just a solid release of Fedora so far.

30:32.060 --> 30:36.100
Wayland has really gotten somewhere and all the work that went into it, all of the performance

30:36.100 --> 30:38.740
improvements that have gone into GNOME 40.

30:38.740 --> 30:42.460
And we should acknowledge there's a lot of great desktops out there.

30:42.460 --> 30:47.260
Plasma 5.21 is also looking fantastic, but today we're talking about this stack.

30:47.260 --> 30:48.940
It's really nice.

30:48.940 --> 30:50.820
It's professional grade.

30:50.820 --> 30:55.760
And what really put it over the top, because I finally got around to figuring out where

30:55.760 --> 31:03.220
it's hidden in the user management UI to enable fingerprint login to the GNOME Shell desktop.

31:03.220 --> 31:07.440
And my ThinkPad X1 Carbon has a fingerprint reader on it.

31:07.440 --> 31:09.660
Super simple to set up.

31:09.660 --> 31:16.020
And to my absolute delight, they even lapped Apple and it can be used for pseudo privileges

31:16.020 --> 31:17.020
in the terminal.

31:17.020 --> 31:19.340
Now that is fancy, dang.

31:19.340 --> 31:20.340
Yeah.

31:20.340 --> 31:22.180
So I can fingerprint sensor from...

31:22.180 --> 31:34.500
I just, this thing feels so pro, it is lean, mean, fast now in like a perceivable UI way.

31:34.500 --> 31:39.100
And this fingerprint integration into the GNOME experience where I can even use it for

31:39.100 --> 31:43.300
pseudo permissions at the terminal, I just feel like all of this combined makes this

31:43.300 --> 31:46.920
one of the most professional grade setups I have ever used.

31:46.920 --> 31:52.320
It's funny how there's all these little tiny pieces of polish, and before on the flip side

31:52.320 --> 31:56.220
of all these changes, those were the little tiny pieces of polish that might keep you

31:56.220 --> 31:59.940
on say like a Mac desktop just because you're making that comparison, you know, like I'm

31:59.940 --> 32:00.940
trying to get work done.

32:00.940 --> 32:03.620
I need a professional workstation that just gets out of my way.

32:03.620 --> 32:04.620
I know it'll work.

32:04.620 --> 32:05.620
It's rock solid.

32:05.620 --> 32:06.940
We're slowly getting there.

32:06.940 --> 32:11.200
I mean, maybe you're already there on plasma, et cetera, but it's coming together, like

32:11.200 --> 32:13.020
you say, and that's just neat to see.

32:13.020 --> 32:19.500
And it's neat to see these tiny backend changes over months and years actually have a perceptible

32:19.500 --> 32:21.860
difference day-to-day on the desktop.

32:21.860 --> 32:23.740
It's so cool to see it all coming together.

32:23.740 --> 32:29.020
Like a lot of hard work has gone in for many years, but specifically in 2020, that's just

32:29.020 --> 32:31.820
kind of all popping in together now.

32:31.820 --> 32:37.340
And like you were saying, Wes, to kind of expand on that, I kind of feel like, and we

32:37.340 --> 32:41.460
have this happen from time to time, we hear from like a disillusioned back user, they

32:41.460 --> 32:44.680
get annoyed with, we were just talking with Ben before the show, you know, he gets annoyed

32:44.680 --> 32:49.300
with something that Apple's doing or the direction Big Sur is going, or they want to stay on

32:49.300 --> 32:53.700
the x86 platform or, you know, all of these list of reasons, or they just burn out and

32:53.700 --> 32:58.700
they want something that's more fun, they'll look at Linux and you try to figure out, well,

32:58.700 --> 33:02.500
maybe we should recommend elementary OS, maybe, you know, Ubuntu, because, you know, if you're

33:02.500 --> 33:05.380
coming from the Mac, you want something that's widely supported.

33:05.380 --> 33:09.140
I don't know, man, this setup, I think is what I'm going to advise.

33:09.140 --> 33:14.620
If somebody's coming with like the low-end MacBook Pro to MacBook, high-end MacBook Air

33:14.620 --> 33:20.580
range, and they want a Linux laptop, the X1 Carbon with Fedora 34, when that whole package

33:20.580 --> 33:24.620
comes together, is going to be an easy, safe recommendation.

33:24.620 --> 33:30.360
But the best part is, all of that stuff that's making that recommendation great is coming

33:30.360 --> 33:32.780
to a distribution and computer near you.

33:32.780 --> 33:37.820
It's not just exclusive to this X1 Carbon or the ThinkPad lineup, because this isn't

33:37.820 --> 33:42.420
the Apple model, this is going to be available to system 76, this is going to be available

33:42.420 --> 33:47.500
to Dell, and everybody is going to have this stuff that makes these systems faster and

33:47.500 --> 33:52.020
perform better, and it's free for those vendors.

33:52.020 --> 33:53.020
It's remarkable.

33:53.020 --> 33:56.700
Now, you can get, depending on what avenue you take in the Linux space, you can get access

33:56.700 --> 34:01.660
to it today if you're willing to run beta software, but I think I'm going to stick on

34:01.660 --> 34:02.660
it, Wes.

34:02.660 --> 34:05.520
I don't think I'm going to go back to a stable release, I'm just going to stick with this

34:05.520 --> 34:06.520
and roll with it.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.400
You're just going to see what happens.

34:08.400 --> 34:11.380
And that means you're also moving away from Arch, huh?

34:11.380 --> 34:12.740
Back over in the Fedora world.

34:12.740 --> 34:15.580
Yeah, at least on that system for a bit.

34:15.580 --> 34:16.580
So there's a...

34:16.580 --> 34:23.860
I really like Arch, but Arch is a DIY kit, and sometimes I know exactly, exactly what

34:23.860 --> 34:24.860
I want.

34:24.860 --> 34:28.060
And I just want to go build that, and I just want it to work, and I want access to as much

34:28.060 --> 34:30.300
software as possible.

34:30.300 --> 34:35.540
And that is probably maybe even the most common use case for me.

34:35.540 --> 34:37.460
And there's also...

34:37.460 --> 34:45.620
You just have to acknowledge Fedora is positioned, for multiple reasons, in a space where these

34:45.620 --> 34:49.300
things sort of land first curated.

34:49.300 --> 34:53.180
I already have Wayland and Pipewire on my Arch box upstairs.

34:53.180 --> 34:54.460
Of course you do.

34:54.460 --> 34:55.460
But it doesn't really...

34:55.460 --> 35:02.660
It's not all coming together all in this package like it does with 34, where you get 40, you

35:02.660 --> 35:05.700
get Pipewire, you get Wayland, you get ButterFS.

35:05.700 --> 35:12.940
Like this whole curated package that is kind of like cutting edge Linux in a thoughtfully

35:12.940 --> 35:14.340
designed way.

35:14.340 --> 35:20.460
It's an idea, it's a concept that I find extremely compelling that Arch doesn't necessarily compel

35:20.460 --> 35:21.460
me in that way.

35:21.460 --> 35:22.460
Right.

35:22.460 --> 35:25.360
Here you're kind of in on the zeitgeist, the place where the action's happening, versus

35:25.360 --> 35:29.780
in Arch, you're off on your own pulling together all this software by yourself.

35:29.780 --> 35:31.420
And both can be useful use cases.

35:31.420 --> 35:33.820
That's the beautiful thing about Linux, right?

35:33.820 --> 35:36.580
And many others that aren't even defined by those two.

35:36.580 --> 35:41.060
But I think the nice thing is to see all of it, to see the different elements.

35:41.060 --> 35:44.460
Like the teams also spent the last couple of years working on a new logo, and that's

35:44.460 --> 35:47.880
going to land with 34, which is going to land with 40.

35:47.880 --> 35:52.480
It all really comes together as sort of a symphony of open source software development

35:52.480 --> 35:53.780
in this particular release.

35:53.780 --> 35:55.720
And so it is fun to be running it.

35:55.720 --> 36:00.140
And we didn't even get into Toolbox, which you know Christian loves to talk about.

36:00.140 --> 36:06.060
But legitimately, Toolbox is a great way to have quick little pet containers.

36:06.060 --> 36:10.740
And now they're making it possible where you can run the RHEL universal base image.

36:10.740 --> 36:17.140
So you could just fire up a Toolbox instance that's RHEL based on your Fedora 34 workstation.

36:17.140 --> 36:21.620
And so you can have a development environment that's totally RHEL production while having

36:21.620 --> 36:23.620
a cutting edge desktop experience.

36:23.620 --> 36:29.740
Like that, man, it's a sweet combination and you can really see it all coming together.

36:29.740 --> 36:34.580
And I love that there is space to talk about this, because it's not just this one thing

36:34.580 --> 36:36.460
that's going to have all these features.

36:36.460 --> 36:40.060
And that's what you get in the Apple world is this one thing and they have these big

36:40.060 --> 36:44.460
bursts like at WWDC where they announce all the new things that this one siloed place

36:44.460 --> 36:45.900
is going to have.

36:45.900 --> 36:47.660
And here it's everyone gets it.

36:47.660 --> 36:48.660
It's just so cool.

36:48.660 --> 36:51.020
Yeah, you can take the pieces you want, you get the updated apps.

36:51.020 --> 36:53.740
You don't have to run any or all of it if you don't want to.

36:53.740 --> 36:56.620
Stay on X if you want, but still play with pipeline.

36:56.620 --> 37:00.520
It's all possible.

37:00.520 --> 37:06.160
Let's do just a spot of cleaning around here and mention a little housekeeping items.

37:06.160 --> 37:09.160
We are getting close to episode 400.

37:09.160 --> 37:13.800
If you haven't been to a live show in a while, might be worth putting on your calendar.

37:13.800 --> 37:18.380
Just a few weeks out and come hang out with us and celebrate our 400th episode.

37:18.380 --> 37:19.500
And of course, our lifetime.

37:19.500 --> 37:22.540
You can get that at Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar.

37:22.540 --> 37:23.540
It's noon Pacific.

37:23.540 --> 37:25.520
You know, it is actually it's pretty easy.

37:25.520 --> 37:27.900
The telegram group's going as well.

37:27.900 --> 37:33.140
Join us at Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash telegram and in the lup lug every Sunday at

37:33.140 --> 37:34.140
noon Pacific.

37:34.140 --> 37:36.120
Again, that's on our calendar.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.120
And that happened.

37:37.120 --> 37:40.780
That just happens in our in our Mumble Room right there in the lobby.

37:40.780 --> 37:42.180
People just hang out talking Linux.

37:42.180 --> 37:43.180
It's pretty nice.

37:43.180 --> 37:44.180
It's pretty cool.

37:44.180 --> 37:45.180
And you can hang out and do it, too.

37:45.180 --> 37:49.420
And then you're all set up for the show when it comes time for you to join.

37:49.420 --> 37:51.540
Maybe on episode 400 and hang out with us.

37:51.540 --> 37:52.540
Huh?

37:52.540 --> 37:53.540
Huh?

37:53.540 --> 37:54.540
We'd like to see you.

37:54.540 --> 37:55.740
That would be pretty great.

37:55.740 --> 37:58.140
So check out the lup lug and get your mumble information.

37:58.140 --> 38:01.660
All of that at Linux unplugged dot com.

38:01.660 --> 38:04.660
And last but not least, I'll just mention we have the all shows feed that I'd love you

38:04.660 --> 38:06.060
to take advantage of.

38:06.060 --> 38:09.860
That way you just get all the shows, all the shows, because there's a lot more going on.

38:09.860 --> 38:12.960
Like we have Linux Action News every Sunday with Wes and I.

38:12.960 --> 38:16.620
We try to break down the biggest news items that you need to know about, kind of with

38:16.620 --> 38:19.940
the mindset that if you're trying to stay current on the industry, these are the trends

38:19.940 --> 38:21.640
we think you should be watching.

38:21.640 --> 38:25.300
And we do that in Linux Action News at Linux Action News dot com.

38:25.300 --> 38:26.980
So go check that out.

38:26.980 --> 38:31.620
And that, my friends, is the housekeeping.

38:31.620 --> 38:34.380
What do you say we do a couple of picks before we go?

38:34.380 --> 38:37.740
Oh, have you have you got something special for us this week?

38:37.740 --> 38:42.500
Well, you know, we have we had like a run of different types of top apps.

38:42.500 --> 38:43.500
And that's fun.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.580
I think every single possible one.

38:45.580 --> 38:48.460
Yeah, as far as I know.

38:48.460 --> 38:52.340
But you know, we've never had a kernel top app until now.

38:52.340 --> 38:54.260
Like if you could call it that, I guess.

38:54.260 --> 38:55.660
It's called Kmon.

38:55.660 --> 38:59.700
It's the Linux kernel manager and activity monitor.

38:59.700 --> 39:03.540
And it's kind of neat, Wes, to kind of explore what your kernel is doing.

39:03.540 --> 39:06.460
Yeah, it is just a handy little command line app.

39:06.460 --> 39:08.660
You can go download it on GitHub.

39:08.660 --> 39:12.260
And by default, you get just a nice little terminal interface where it lists out all

39:12.260 --> 39:13.260
your modules.

39:13.260 --> 39:14.260
You can scroll through.

39:14.260 --> 39:18.640
You can have that interaction with your keyboard input or also the mouse, it looks like.

39:18.640 --> 39:22.880
And it's got a handy log of all the stuff your kernels been up to.

39:22.880 --> 39:26.540
Even better than that, Chris, it's written in Rust.

39:26.540 --> 39:36.300
Oh, no way.

39:36.300 --> 39:37.300
You didn't say anything.

39:37.300 --> 39:38.540
You waited to tell me that.

39:38.540 --> 39:40.820
I know how you like to be surprised.

39:40.820 --> 39:48.300
All right, well, I'm going to submit a Linux application that is a Mac favorite, but with

39:48.300 --> 39:50.700
a much cooler Linux twist.

39:50.700 --> 39:52.180
When we do it, we do it right.

39:52.180 --> 39:55.820
It's called eBPF snitch.

39:55.820 --> 40:01.900
If you're familiar with little snitch on the Mac platform, it would monitor outbound traffic

40:01.900 --> 40:07.240
and snitch on an application that is trying to connect to a server without your permission.

40:07.240 --> 40:13.660
And you could discover some interesting metrics being collected by using an app like this.

40:13.660 --> 40:18.700
Well, eBPF snitch is a Linux application level firewall that's based on eBPF, which we've

40:18.700 --> 40:21.420
talked about, and NFQ.

40:21.420 --> 40:25.620
Of course, it's inspired by OpenSnitch, which is also we've mentioned before on the show.

40:25.620 --> 40:30.460
But it uses more modern kernel abstractions without the need of a kernel module, which

40:30.460 --> 40:31.460
is great.

40:31.460 --> 40:34.020
The daemon is implemented in C++ 20.

40:34.020 --> 40:39.300
And the interface to manage it all is Python 3 with Qt 5 bindings for the UI.

40:39.300 --> 40:40.300
I mean, it works.

40:40.300 --> 40:43.660
It's not the prettiest UI, but I don't know what you want for something like this.

40:43.660 --> 40:45.140
Yeah, what do you expect?

40:45.140 --> 40:46.140
Yeah.

40:46.140 --> 40:47.140
Yeah.

40:47.140 --> 40:49.780
All right, you got to get the features in first to make it actually work, and we'll

40:49.780 --> 40:50.780
pretty it up later.

40:50.780 --> 40:51.780
Yeah.

40:51.780 --> 40:54.420
And yeah, I think that this uses eBPF is super exciting.

40:54.420 --> 40:58.260
You know, there's been some issues, I know, in recent Mac releases around little snitch

40:58.260 --> 41:02.500
and having to add modules on the Mac side or similar techniques here.

41:02.500 --> 41:05.320
Any time you're directly messing with the kernel, well, maybe you get a little nervous

41:05.320 --> 41:07.020
or it's a reason not to install it.

41:07.020 --> 41:11.460
But if you have a modern kernel, you have eBPF support, this seems like a no brainer.

41:11.460 --> 41:15.800
Although disclaimer, security of this application has not been audited by a third party, or

41:15.800 --> 41:17.460
even myself from rights the developer.

41:17.460 --> 41:19.060
So hey, there you go.

41:19.060 --> 41:22.300
Westpain cannot guarantee the security nor can the developer.

41:22.300 --> 41:25.280
Don't blame me blame Chris.

41:25.280 --> 41:27.340
Don't you know it's it's blame Alan Jude.

41:27.340 --> 41:28.340
It's always blame Alan Jude.

41:28.340 --> 41:29.340
All right.

41:29.340 --> 41:31.380
Well, hey, Wes.

41:31.380 --> 41:34.120
How about a little bit of feedback before we go?

41:34.120 --> 41:39.500
We had somebody write in on the Docker socket security thing that we talked about in a recent

41:39.500 --> 41:40.500
episode.

41:40.500 --> 41:46.740
Frank the Tank writes in again, writing in regards to episode 395 and the misconfiguration

41:46.740 --> 41:48.820
Neil had used to take over the system.

41:48.820 --> 41:52.940
As far as I remember, it was the ability to access the Docker socket.

41:52.940 --> 41:59.140
Now, I run Debian 10 on my machine, and that isn't possible as a regular user.

41:59.140 --> 42:04.540
Although I didn't configure anything in those regards and Docker can wrap arm or anything.

42:04.540 --> 42:10.100
So how come it works on your Debian nine system, the default change from stretch to buster?

42:10.100 --> 42:13.500
I'm afraid my machine also has this vulnerability without me knowing it.

42:13.500 --> 42:16.900
Can you please explain a little bit more about how to avoid it?

42:16.900 --> 42:18.760
Thanks a lot, Frank.

42:18.760 --> 42:20.940
Good question, Frank.

42:20.940 --> 42:21.940
Thank you for writing that in.

42:21.940 --> 42:25.100
So did we tinker with it beyond any defaults?

42:25.100 --> 42:29.220
I remember we had several discussions around it, but I can't remember what we ended up

42:29.220 --> 42:30.220
ultimately doing.

42:30.220 --> 42:31.220
Yeah.

42:31.220 --> 42:35.420
So in our case, it was just that that user shouldn't have had access to the Docker socket.

42:35.420 --> 42:40.380
So whether that was misconfiguration of the user permissions, adding it to a group, say,

42:40.380 --> 42:44.740
or that was misconfigurations of permissions on the socket itself, either way, the result

42:44.740 --> 42:45.740
was the same.

42:45.740 --> 42:50.060
But by default, hopefully your distro doesn't have that and that any users that don't need

42:50.060 --> 42:51.980
access will make sure they don't have it.

42:51.980 --> 42:55.300
Yeah, it was really to demonstrate how risky that is.

42:55.300 --> 43:00.000
But I recall the other thing, Frank, I think to keep in mind that we did to just make it

43:00.000 --> 43:05.580
achievable in the time span that we had is we enabled the backup account to have shell

43:05.580 --> 43:08.840
access and then that password got leaked.

43:08.840 --> 43:13.700
So that the reason why we did that is because with the exception of leaking, as far as I

43:13.700 --> 43:19.820
know, I actually have seen that in production, that that configuration that we we went with.

43:19.820 --> 43:24.220
And so it is very common, or at least possible.

43:24.220 --> 43:30.300
But it does require at least having, in our case, the backup user in the Docker group.

43:30.300 --> 43:31.300
That's right.

43:31.300 --> 43:32.580
That was kind of the concession we made.

43:32.580 --> 43:37.500
But I think it also demonstrates just the risk you do take by having that Docker daemon

43:37.500 --> 43:38.860
run as root.

43:38.860 --> 43:40.180
Yeah, exactly.

43:40.180 --> 43:45.020
Think carefully about what you're giving access, what accounts, what users and maybe consider

43:45.020 --> 43:46.940
something like Podman.

43:46.940 --> 43:51.380
Or at least don't let Neil on your system.

43:51.380 --> 43:53.180
So yeah, there's that.

43:53.180 --> 43:54.220
We're going to do it again, though.

43:54.220 --> 43:58.020
I think we'll give it some time and then we're going to do another one.

43:58.020 --> 43:59.100
So stay tuned, Frank.

43:59.100 --> 44:03.620
Alex writes in, I asked about exiting big picture mode because I was playing with that

44:03.620 --> 44:08.400
Steam Link application that was recently released by Valve and Collabra that just is essentially

44:08.400 --> 44:15.220
a thin client streaming app to connect to another PC running Steam, Windows or Linux.

44:15.220 --> 44:18.500
And you get in big picture mode and every now and then I had confused it and I could

44:18.500 --> 44:20.780
tell there must have been a way to get to the desktop.

44:20.780 --> 44:24.620
I actually got a couple of tips, but I liked Alex's just because it was so simple.

44:24.620 --> 44:26.820
He says it's really easy when you're in big picture mode.

44:26.820 --> 44:31.980
Just go to the gear icon in the top right and hit close big picture mode.

44:31.980 --> 44:34.300
Then you're just in a regular remote desktop session.

44:34.300 --> 44:36.020
I do it all the time and it works well.

44:36.020 --> 44:37.020
Thanks for the show, Alex.

44:37.020 --> 44:38.020
How about that?

44:38.020 --> 44:40.860
That sounds really simple.

44:40.860 --> 44:41.860
Just exit it.

44:41.860 --> 44:45.500
So you're giving tips about replacing Jack and Pulse with PipeWire and then the audience

44:45.500 --> 44:48.300
is giving you tips about how to exit your app to the desktop.

44:48.300 --> 44:49.300
I guess so.

44:49.300 --> 44:50.660
Hey, you know what?

44:50.660 --> 44:56.500
That's fine by me, linuxunplug.com slash contact if you want to suggest an app pick or respond

44:56.500 --> 45:00.100
to something we've talked about on the show or share your thoughts about the future direction

45:00.100 --> 45:04.520
of the Linux desktop and why it's more interesting than ever because there's many reasons we

45:04.520 --> 45:09.220
didn't even touch on in this episode and you could give voice to some of them at linuxunplug.com

45:09.220 --> 45:10.220
slash contact.

45:10.220 --> 45:14.140
Hey, Wes, did you know they could get more of you at linuxactionnews.com?

45:14.140 --> 45:15.140
Yes they can.

45:15.140 --> 45:16.140
That's true.

45:16.140 --> 45:20.100
There's more stuff going on than what we managed to cover in this episode and so we packaged

45:20.100 --> 45:23.860
it all up in an easy to digest format at linuxactionnews.com.

45:23.860 --> 45:27.340
If you do the Twitter thing, you can follow this show at linuxunplugged.

45:27.340 --> 45:28.720
I'm at Chris Lass.

45:28.720 --> 45:29.780
What about you, Wes?

45:29.780 --> 45:31.140
I'm at Wes Payne.

45:31.140 --> 45:36.740
Hey, that's easy and today I was even teasing what we're talking about and getting the conversation

45:36.740 --> 45:42.640
rolling there and the entire Jupiter Broadcasting Network of fantastic shows, well you can find

45:42.640 --> 45:45.280
that at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

45:45.280 --> 45:47.320
There's more shows.

45:47.320 --> 45:48.500
Did you know that?

45:48.500 --> 45:49.500
Just check that out.

45:49.500 --> 45:50.500
I mean, why not?

45:50.500 --> 45:51.500
JupiterBroadcasting.com.

45:51.500 --> 45:52.500
Why not?

45:52.500 --> 45:57.180
And while you're there, head to slash calendar to find out when will next be live.

45:57.180 --> 46:00.980
Sure, it's usually the same bad time, but you never know.

46:00.980 --> 46:02.380
See you next week.

46:02.380 --> 46:04.420
Same bad time, same bad station.

46:04.420 --> 46:07.500
As far as we know, it will be, but you never know.

46:07.500 --> 46:08.500
Things could change.

46:08.500 --> 46:09.500
Things could change.

46:09.500 --> 46:14.340
I've been tinkering with an idea in my head, so it is worth checking that from time to

46:14.340 --> 46:15.340
time.

46:15.340 --> 46:18.780
Otherwise, join us at 12 PM Pacific, 3 PM Eastern on a Tuesday.

46:18.780 --> 46:23.140
Links to everything we talked about are at linuxunplugged.com, like how to contact us,

46:23.140 --> 46:28.740
mumble info, matrix info, subscription links for the show.

46:28.740 --> 46:29.740
It's all over there.

46:29.740 --> 46:34.100
It's all over there, man, at linuxunplugged.com, so go check it out.

46:34.100 --> 46:38.860
Thank you so much for joining us on this week's episode of Your Unplugged program.

46:38.860 --> 47:07.980
And with all of that said, future and all, we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

47:08.860 --> 47:26.020
Okay, JBtitles.com, let's go pick our title.

47:26.020 --> 47:31.500
And then also, I just wanted to mention, because I know a lot of us in the community are Telegram

47:31.500 --> 47:37.220
users, it looks like Telegram is in a tough spot.

47:37.220 --> 47:42.660
They're looking to basically raise like a billion in debt funds.

47:42.660 --> 47:50.300
The messaging service has about $700 million due at the end of April to creditors.

47:50.300 --> 47:56.500
And of course, at the same time, as we've all seen, Telegram's usage is exploding right

47:56.500 --> 47:57.500
now.

47:57.500 --> 48:02.860
And so the expenses for bandwidth and storage are described as rapidly growing.

48:02.860 --> 48:08.100
Are you saying I should stop uploading giant mp4s just to send to myself via Telegram?

48:08.100 --> 48:09.100
Dang it.

48:09.100 --> 48:12.460
Yeah, Telegram is going to have to start raising money.

48:12.460 --> 48:16.380
So expect to see ads soon, because if they're going to go raise money and get a bunch of

48:16.380 --> 48:19.600
funds in, they're going to have to promise these investors a return on that money.

48:19.600 --> 48:24.820
And the way they're going to do that is probably through some sort of ad system or subscription,

48:24.820 --> 48:25.820
I don't know.

48:25.820 --> 48:26.820
Would you pay?

48:26.820 --> 48:27.820
Would you subscribe?

48:27.820 --> 48:28.820
I think I would.

48:28.820 --> 48:35.260
I've heard a lot about it and Telegram so far, I think we all still remain slightly

48:35.260 --> 48:40.100
suspicious of their own crypto that they've decided to implement for secret chats.

48:40.100 --> 48:46.620
But relatively speaking, it has been unbelievably solid for years now.

48:46.620 --> 48:50.420
And it handles crazy scale groups, because I got in some of those Wall Street bet groups

48:50.420 --> 48:53.980
for fun and they were crazy sized.

48:53.980 --> 48:56.920
It handles low bandwidth situations really well.

48:56.920 --> 49:04.700
And also, the desktop client is really reasonable when you look at the other chat desktop clients

49:04.700 --> 49:06.500
out there for chat services.

49:06.500 --> 49:08.300
I think Telegram is like one of the best.

49:08.300 --> 49:11.860
Yeah, they've just kind of continued to be a good chat client.

49:11.860 --> 49:15.100
That's always what keeps me there is it's like, okay, you're fast, you're easy, you

49:15.100 --> 49:19.180
support me sending all the different, you know, gifts or images or attachments.

49:19.180 --> 49:22.260
I mean, I've had my family on there and they haven't complained.

49:22.260 --> 49:23.820
So that's got to be a test too, right?

49:23.820 --> 49:25.660
Yeah, I have my family on there.

49:25.660 --> 49:27.500
It all works for them.

49:27.500 --> 49:32.300
And I haven't really noticed the Telegram desktop client for Linux lagging far behind

49:32.300 --> 49:35.140
the commercial platforms versions.

49:35.140 --> 49:39.020
And I still really appreciate the fact that they have certain accessibility tools like

49:39.020 --> 49:43.140
Zoom and Scale that I like, and they integrate natively with my desktop notifications.

49:43.140 --> 49:48.740
I mean, all in all, as far as features go for a desktop chat application that also has

49:48.740 --> 49:54.060
a great mobile app, that also has a web client available that has a lot of features, including

49:54.060 --> 49:58.140
voice calling and video calling and group chats and channels and private messages and

49:58.140 --> 50:02.140
secret chats and self-destructing chats and, you know, on and on and on, right?

50:02.140 --> 50:03.140
It's pretty good.

50:03.140 --> 50:04.140
I'd hate to see it go away.

50:04.140 --> 50:10.000
And I would much rather pay $10 a month, I guess, than have ads in my chats.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.300
That I don't really want.

50:11.300 --> 50:14.740
Or maybe ads in the Jupiter broadcasting channel, right?

50:14.740 --> 50:15.740
Yeah.

50:15.740 --> 50:17.260
Yeah, I don't like that.

50:17.260 --> 50:20.780
How would you say that Telegram stacks up against Matrix?

50:20.780 --> 50:24.140
Well, it's way more accessible by regular folks.

50:24.140 --> 50:28.660
You know, I can have a family member get on Telegram in 15 minutes just to do a chat session

50:28.660 --> 50:29.660
with them.

50:29.660 --> 50:34.780
I couldn't have like my aunt or my uncle who I'm thinking of in this scenario, they wouldn't

50:34.780 --> 50:35.780
be able to set up Matrix.

50:35.780 --> 50:38.400
It'd be beyond them for sure.

50:38.400 --> 50:40.820
Even Element, you know, it's just, it's too complicated.

50:40.820 --> 50:43.980
I think Telegram is a different use case as well.

50:43.980 --> 50:48.440
Because with Matrix, I feel like it's more like the Discord use where you have a server

50:48.440 --> 50:54.120
for a community, and then you can have a bunch of rooms on that server for more focused discussions.

50:54.120 --> 50:56.100
It's also continuous engagement, right?

50:56.100 --> 50:59.460
Telegram is very ephemeral, in a sense, because it goes by.

50:59.460 --> 51:00.460
Yeah.

51:00.460 --> 51:01.460
And it's also like very one on one.

51:01.460 --> 51:05.340
Like there's oh, yeah, yeah, you can tell because like how poor the experiences for

51:05.340 --> 51:07.940
group chats relative to the one on one chats.

51:07.940 --> 51:08.940
Exactly.

51:08.940 --> 51:13.500
It's definitely came as a direct person to person messenger first, with group chat features

51:13.500 --> 51:16.220
later where Matrix was built with group chat in mind.

51:16.220 --> 51:17.220
So it just depends what goal.

51:17.220 --> 51:20.860
So for me, like if I'm just communicating something quickly with people, I think Telegram

51:20.860 --> 51:23.600
may be the better solution if it's just one on one chats.

51:23.600 --> 51:26.540
But if I'm already in Matrix, you know, then just use Element.

51:26.540 --> 51:33.260
Anyways, I just think it's a tricky spot they're in to have $700 million due by the end of

51:33.260 --> 51:34.260
April.

51:34.260 --> 51:39.100
They kind of went all in on hoping a coin would be their path to revenue, and then got

51:39.100 --> 51:41.060
shut down by the regulators.

51:41.060 --> 51:44.980
And now they're kind of having to figure out a plan B. And it doesn't seem like it's super

51:44.980 --> 51:46.500
solid yet.

51:46.500 --> 51:51.620
And so I mean, I'm grateful for options like Matrix kernel because we have a pretty solid

51:51.620 --> 51:56.260
plan B. There's obviously other platforms out there like Signal and Wire.

51:56.260 --> 51:58.500
And I know a lot of people use WhatsApp and others.

51:58.500 --> 52:01.480
Telegram has just sort of been the one that I've landed on and a lot of my family and

52:01.480 --> 52:03.300
friends and community have landed on.

52:03.300 --> 52:05.300
So who do you think is going to buy them?

52:05.300 --> 52:07.540
That's the question, isn't it?

52:07.540 --> 52:08.540
I don't know.

52:08.540 --> 52:10.020
Leave your prediction below.

52:10.020 --> 52:23.740
Maybe it'll be a Tesla jet.
