1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
How's the packing going, Brent?

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,040
You on track to make it tonight?

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,440
I think actually the packing is the easy part.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,720
No, I'm not going to make it tonight.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,680
There's no way.

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,720
With the postal up crash and all the things

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,080
that I'm hoping to do, I am going to fail you.

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,520
I think it's going to be a morning thing.

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,080
I like that you're just scheduling in the post-show crash.

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,200
Like, that's a good idea.

11
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,200
That shows he's an experienced podcaster.

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,680
Oh, yeah.

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,920
I mean, you know how real that is, right?

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,800
It's essential.

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,840
So I don't know.

16
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,000
So the plan originally was we'd do the show.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,160
This is always how these planning sessions go,

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,120
is we're planning.

19
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,400
And it's like, so yeah, then you could just

20
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,240
head out like after the show and then hit the road.

21
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,440
Should be no big deal, right?

22
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,040
And because I'm always, this always happens to me too.

23
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,080
It's like, oh, yeah, no problem.

24
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:42,880
Yeah, that's fine.

25
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,040
And then you get to the day of and you're like,

26
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,520
there's no effing way I'm leaving after the show.

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,840
Even though I've been prepping all week, there's no way.

28
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,400
I mean, one, it means you have to have everything packed,

29
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,200
right?

30
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,840
Yeah, right.

31
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,800
Oh, I'm sorry, Brent.

32
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,600
But you know what?

33
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
What you got to do is set yourself

34
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,920
like a timed windows to pack.

35
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,760
And then you just, you know, you take breaks.

36
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,560
You'll get through it.

37
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,280
You'll make it.

38
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,400
Or just don't bring anything.

39
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,040
You know, just go freestyle.

40
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,560
Just throw caution to the wind.

41
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,840
I did give my car a car wash, so there's that at least.

42
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,360
Hey, you'll come in style.

43
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:24,880
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

44
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,680
My name is Chris.

45
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,640
My name is Wes.

46
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,000
And my name is Brent.

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,280
Hello, gentlemen.

48
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,440
I'm talking like this today because it's a very exciting

49
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:31,920
show.

50
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,320
Hello, perhaps.

51
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,240
We have some desktop woes that we're

52
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,080
going to share with you today.

53
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,160
And we're going to be talking about some of the things

54
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,920
that we're going to be talking about today.

55
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,160
Some desktop woes that we're going to share with you

56
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,040
that have struck recently, we'll just say.

57
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,360
And we have some thoughts on some new hardware that's

58
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,200
going to get drafted for some space work.

59
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,720
We have some bugs to file.

60
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,760
There's a lot to do today.

61
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,400
And we're going to round it all out with some great boosts,

62
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,840
some pics, and more.

63
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,200
So before we get any further, let's

64
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,840
say time-appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

65
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,880
Hello, Mumble Room.

66
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,760
Hello, hello.

67
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,720
Hey, Chris.

68
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,240
Hey, Wes, and hey, Brent.

69
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,840
Time-appropriate greetings, everybody.

70
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,040
Hello, hello.

71
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,240
Thank you for joining us.

72
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,080
Thank you to everybody watching over at jupyter.tube

73
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,520
as we stream it live.

74
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,080
And a good morning to our friends over at TailScale.

75
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,640
TailScale is a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard's noise

76
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,800
protocol.

77
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,680
Noise?

78
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,760
It's a noise protocol.

79
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,680
I just think that's so great.

80
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,160
We love it.

81
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,200
We use it every single day.

82
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,880
I think it's going to change your game.

83
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,320
I think it's up there with R-Sync and SSH.

84
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,080
Go check out TailScale, tailscale.com.

85
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,400
Get it for free on 20 devices.

86
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,040
And tell them the Unplugged program sent you.

87
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,240
So we have an interesting story to talk about this week.

88
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,800
It seems that NASA has selected SciFive,

89
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,000
makers of RISC-V systems, as maybe the potential go-to

90
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,920
ecosystem for future space hardware.

91
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,960
And of course, that's obviously going to be running Linux.

92
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,520
And SciFive, they're like over the moon on this one.

93
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,240
They say that their devices are going

94
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,960
to offer a 100x increase in computational capacity.

95
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,360
Well, yeah, if you remember when we were talking with Tim,

96
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,240
he was mentioning where Linux was kind of running

97
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,860
on this off-the-shelf hardware, but they

98
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,800
had these pretty much ancient PowerPC processors

99
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,240
that were all radiation-hardened.

100
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,160
But those are getting pretty old, and we need something new.

101
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,240
And so yeah, kind of the customizability

102
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,000
of the RISC-V platform, they can make something

103
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,240
that's a huge speed improvement, but also still

104
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,440
meet all of the strenuous needs of interplanetary travel.

105
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,880
There's a lot I like about this.

106
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,880
First of all, I think this is just a great platform

107
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,680
for them to pick.

108
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,840
It's something that'll be around a long time,

109
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,880
and it's an open platform.

110
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,520
And it's going to encourage driver development for Linux

111
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,880
and all those things, which is really great.

112
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,520
And it's one of the things that when an organization like NASA

113
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,720
selects a hardware platform, it kind of just

114
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
it means we're going to see a base level of support

115
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,520
for a very long time.

116
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,720
So that's really great.

117
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,840
I think the other thing that's really kind of excellent

118
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,520
about this is I would expect it's

119
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,520
going to bring more developers into RISC-V. It's going to mean

120
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,240
they're going to have more people that are learning how

121
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,400
to write RISC-V of applications and systems.

122
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,120
Like I think, I don't know if the halo effect of this

123
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,120
is the right term, but I think just the effect,

124
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,280
the second order effects of NASA doing this

125
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,440
and requiring software developed for it

126
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,280
means that there's just going to be more of an ecosystem

127
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,560
investment in RISC now.

128
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
Seems like nice timing too, just as they're

129
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,040
sort of gaining confidence in deploying Linux

130
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,960
in some of these environments, plus now deploying RISC-V.

131
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,440
And we know Linux has been putting in,

132
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,020
there's been many developers putting in some time

133
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,600
to get Linux's RISC-V support up and going.

134
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,400
I think you're right, that's only going to accelerate.

135
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,320
Wouldn't it be interesting if the story of RISC-V

136
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,240
is like this slow one?

137
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,040
You know, you start seeing it in these rovers, helicopters,

138
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,960
or whatever they might use it on, moon buggies.

139
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,880
But wouldn't it be funny if it takes like 20 years,

140
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,280
I mean not funny, but wouldn't it just figure

141
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,760
it takes like 10, 20 years of using RISC-V in this capacity,

142
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,620
starts as hard drive controllers,

143
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,840
and then it kind of works its way up.

144
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,360
And you know, by now we're starting to see

145
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,480
those single board computers, but not very many of them,

146
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,600
and they're very specialized.

147
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,000
And it's just the slowest of the slow burns,

148
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,600
but it does actually seem to be going

149
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,200
in the upwards direction.

150
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,320
It seems like it's kind of, you know,

151
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,480
the hardware world, CPUs, it just takes time.

152
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,620
Devices have, you know, they age in place to some extent,

153
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,640
and then just to get the adoption to meet the standards.

154
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,240
You know, ARM's dominating the world now,

155
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
but there were times where just like,

156
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,840
oh, that's that funny embedded CPU.

157
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
I mean, don't do anything serious with that.

158
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,080
Yeah, maybe so, you're right.

159
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,480
And I wonder if it isn't even a longer,

160
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,600
upper hill battle now, because there is so much momentum

161
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,200
around X86, and ARM, and PowerPC.

162
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,040
There's so much already established momentum development

163
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,360
ecosystem that for something to come along

164
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,280
and truly get widespread adoption,

165
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,360
it takes some of that stuff aging out.

166
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,920
It takes some of that stuff just kind of fading away.

167
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,780
The developer talent leaving,

168
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,840
it's not like they have an incentive

169
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,320
to switch to RISC-V right away.

170
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,280
So it would make sense that as these trends

171
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,880
and these technologies become more entrenched over time,

172
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,000
that something new coming along is gonna have

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,440
a much longer road before it really gets

174
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,880
significant market share.

175
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,480
It's gonna be a while, but this is a huge first step.

176
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,560
I wonder if Tim will have any thoughts

177
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,200
when we get down to JPL and talk to him about it.

178
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,840
We'll have to bend his ear on this one.

179
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,040
We are gonna be there soon.

180
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,160
We have not left the road for the road yet,

181
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,160
but we do leave soon after next week's episode.

182
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,280
So we're doing a double next Sunday over at jupyter.tube.

183
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,120
We're recording two Linux unplugs,

184
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,580
so that way we have one recorded while we're on the road.

185
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,560
Just give us a little drive time.

186
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,660
Yeah, you know, if you're not always able to make it live,

187
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,600
that's one not to miss.

188
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,280
Yeah, and then after that,

189
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,080
we're gonna do the shows live from the road.

190
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,520
September 18th.

191
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,760
I think what's lucky about next week is

192
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,840
three of us are gonna be in the studio together, I think.

193
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,680
That's true, right, Wes?

194
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
You're gonna make it too?

195
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,040
Mm-hmm, I sure will.

196
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,360
Assuming you get all your stuff packed.

197
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,320
Hey, now.

198
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,280
I think I can make it there in seven days.

199
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,400
I think we can do that.

200
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,600
Ha ha ha.

201
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,160
But that also doesn't happen too often.

202
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,160
You know, only what, like a couple times a year?

203
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,160
So that is a pretty special thing,

204
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,020
or at least it is for me.

205
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,060
So I would say if you wanna catch one,

206
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,900
that's one to catch.

207
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,240
Two to catch, two to catch.

208
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,120
We've been looking forward to this.

209
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,940
The audience has helped make it possible

210
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,340
with the splits to the boost of the show.

211
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,720
Mm, my tank is overfilled.

212
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,560
Brent's gonna make it down,

213
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,360
even though now, of course, we have wildfires,

214
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,600
of course, in the area.

215
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,760
So he'll get a nice kind of a smoked Brent flavor

216
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,600
when he arrives.

217
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,280
We lit off the fireworks to welcome him.

218
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
Yeah, that's what we do.

219
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,400
Smokey welcome.

220
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,160
Although we thought he's gonna be on time,

221
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,240
so we let them off a little early,

222
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,360
and so that's all an embarrassing thing, but yeah.

223
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,720
Then, so Brent gets here a couple of days

224
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,320
from when we're recording.

225
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,920
Then we're gonna record some content.

226
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,840
We'll do that double up,

227
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,000
and then we're hitting the road for our west coast tour.

228
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,200
And we have dates at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

229
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,880
You never know, things can always change,

230
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,240
so be sure you're following that.

231
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,680
Even if you're already signed up,

232
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,340
just keep an eye on things.

233
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,160
We also have that matrix room, West Coast Crew,

234
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,880
bit.ly slash West Coast Crew.

235
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,460
And we're gonna have some special Linode swag,

236
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,500
because of course, Linode is making this possible.

237
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,960
They're once again partnering with us

238
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,760
to make it doable from a financial standpoint

239
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,920
and from a operational standpoint

240
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,640
and from a logistics standpoint,

241
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,120
to go do these meetups and to go see the community,

242
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,720
to help invest in that community.

243
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,520
It's a real kind of like, you know, high level thing.

244
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,000
And they get it, and they support it,

245
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,480
and we're really grateful.

246
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,600
So we'll have some special swag from them too

247
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,420
that we'll be giving out.

248
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,560
And we'll also have some geocaches

249
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,960
that we'll be stashing along the way.

250
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,080
I'd also like to say if you're planning on joining us

251
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,360
to one of the meetups,

252
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,800
it is pretty important for us to know that you're attending.

253
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,600
So if you can RSVP at the meetup page,

254
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,040
that just helps us suss out some of the numbers

255
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,240
and be able to let the events spaces,

256
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,000
the restaurants know ahead of time

257
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,120
so that we're not surprising them.

258
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,680
So if you can make sure to RSVP, that'd be great.

259
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,760
Linode.com slash unplugged.

260
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,000
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

261
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,880
And that's a great way to support the show.

262
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,760
You know, you're getting yourself

263
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,800
some really great experience.

264
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,640
You're getting a hundred bucks to go play with,

265
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,960
I think the best cloud hosting platform out there.

266
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,280
And it's a great way to support the show.

267
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,300
You're supporting the show.

268
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,640
How great is that?

269
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,080
And Linode is really the Linux geeks cloud.

270
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,840
They've got 11 data centers worldwide.

271
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,800
They've been doing this for nearly 19 years.

272
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,960
So they really know what they're doing.

273
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,520
They've had to build the best in class experience

274
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,460
to beat out and compete with everybody else who came along,

275
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,920
not to mention the hyperscalers now,

276
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,960
who seem to have unlimited budgets because let's face it,

277
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,620
their data center operations are funded

278
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,160
by like a completely unrelated business.

279
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,320
So they just had the capacity,

280
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,480
but Linode has had to survive

281
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,360
on the merits of their business.

282
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,920
And their performance is incredible.

283
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,600
They have 11 data centers around the world.

284
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
They have a ton of great services too,

285
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,720
stuff you can just one click deploy.

286
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
I was just looking recently

287
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,200
because I was setting myself up a new Linode.

288
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
And I noticed they just added the Unified Network

289
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,440
application, which is a control panel

290
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,800
that simplifies network management.

291
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,160
If you have Unified Gear, you can throw it up on Linode.

292
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,360
They've always, always been innovating.

293
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,480
Every time I go there, there's like new stuff they've added.

294
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,960
In fact, now they even have a better UI

295
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,800
for displaying it all.

296
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,680
I'm looking at it right now.

297
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,600
I've stopped doing the read,

298
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,760
and now I'm just looking at the different rigs

299
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,600
I want to deploy.

300
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,500
I love Linode, and I think you will too.

301
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,080
The performance, the ease of just getting things up

302
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,000
and running.

303
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,680
And some days I'm feeling like I just want

304
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,600
a push button solution.

305
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,080
Some days I want to build it up from the ground.

306
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,600
And Linode lets me do whichever I prefer.

307
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,480
And if I ever make a mistake, if I ever get stuck,

308
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,360
if I ever need help, they've got 24 seven support.

309
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,840
Because the business, again, has had to actually survive

310
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,160
on the merits of being a really good cloud provider.

311
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,880
And so part of that is having, well,

312
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,600
the best customer support.

313
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,680
So go try them out.

314
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,960
Super fast rigs and networking,

315
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,580
11 data centers around the world,

316
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,880
a Linux culture that runs deep, and 24 seven support.

317
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,400
Plus, it's a great way to support the show.

318
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,960
So go get that hundred bucks.

319
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,660
Linode.com slash unplugged.

320
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,440
One more time, it's Linode.com slash unplugged.

321
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,440
We got some baller boosts, the big supporters

322
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,680
for the show this week.

323
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,040
And just a reminder, we have a link in the show notes

324
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,160
to an open issue to help us source a new baller boost

325
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,400
and sound bite, I should say.

326
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,440
And there's some really good ones in there.

327
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,840
So do keep them coming.

328
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,640
I think what we have three or four people,

329
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,800
it's mostly Brent.

330
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,480
Yeah, Brent laid the seeds here and did a good job.

331
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,600
I figured I would like, you know, warm things up

332
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,160
and leave a sort of template for those to follow.

333
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,520
And I've been pretty happy with the extra submissions.

334
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,880
So I think keep them rolling in.

335
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,260
I'd like to see more people do it though,

336
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,040
because right now this is feeling like one of those issues

337
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,220
where like I bring up, hey, what color should this thing be?

338
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,760
And everybody has an opinion on the color,

339
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,440
but then I ask, okay, who's gonna write the code

340
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,680
to set that to be that color?

341
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,000
And then like, nobody steps up.

342
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,300
It's like, oh, so nobody really cares.

343
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,140
I do.

344
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,560
They have an opinion until the work comes to,

345
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,620
yeah, right, I know you do.

346
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,880
Yeah, so we'll have a link in the show notes

347
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,920
and we'll get a new baller boost.

348
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,540
But in the meantime, I do wanna thank Jade Lion

349
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,500
for their 111,111 SATs.

350
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,200
They boosted in for my long podcasting 2.0 rant support

351
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,040
last week.

352
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,060
Thank you very much for that, Jade.

353
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,120
And I wanted to say, you know,

354
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,520
something interesting happened in the last week.

355
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,600
Fountain has made a new discovery mechanism.

356
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,320
They've built a new discovery mechanism

357
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,560
into the Fountain podcast player.

358
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,880
And one of the tabs when you're looking for podcasts

359
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,880
to find now is some of the most boosted shows on Fountain.

360
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,680
They call it hot on Fountain in there.

361
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,720
And this exposes shows that are getting some big boosts.

362
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,160
And as a result, we've had thousands of people

363
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,800
find the show in the last week.

364
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,200
What people are doing is these boosts act as signal.

365
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,960
When people see a show that gets boosted a lot,

366
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,320
it's a good indication there's high quality there.

367
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,400
It's better than any kind of algorithm from Google.

368
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,640
It's real people sending real value to that podcaster.

369
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,560
It's a real signal.

370
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,040
So Fountain is now exposing that

371
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,600
and showing you which ones are getting the boosts.

372
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,920
And what's incredible now is not only can you support

373
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,440
the show by boosting and get a message onto the show,

374
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,560
but you can also make it possible for other people

375
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,100
to discover the show by putting this on these lists.

376
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,800
So when we get a boost from Jade, that's 111,000 SATs,

377
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,800
that puts us up there on that list.

378
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,440
That makes a difference to the show,

379
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,300
not just in a monetary sense,

380
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,920
but in a way that helps other people find the show.

381
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,640
So thank you very much for that.

382
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,960
And Fountain, keep on rocking it.

383
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,020
Check out the Hot on Fountain

384
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,560
and their new lightning podcast section,

385
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,620
helping really spread value for value

386
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,620
and podcasting 2.0 and decentralized podcast financing.

387
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,680
You know, Chris, I would imagine

388
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,200
that's an unintended consequence.

389
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,800
Like that's not something we could have really predicted

390
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,680
when we kind of kicked all this off in January.

391
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,940
And I totally think it makes sense.

392
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,440
I hadn't thought about it, but it absolutely makes sense

393
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,040
is I've discovered shows by,

394
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,720
so one of the big things in Fountain,

395
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,680
not to go on and on about it,

396
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,800
because I think Podverse is really great too.

397
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,400
But one of the great things in Fountain

398
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,200
is that they have this clips section

399
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,300
that is really well done.

400
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,520
And I have added three weekly listens now,

401
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,840
three weekly listens to my podcast collection

402
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,960
through this clips mechanism on here.

403
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,800
And boy, isn't that something like,

404
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,760
how did this not get thought of earlier?

405
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,360
It's a perfect thing for highlighting and sharing podcasts.

406
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,200
It totally is.

407
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,400
Because how often are you listening to one,

408
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,600
you're like, that was a great little thing.

409
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,500
They summarized X or they explained that well.

410
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,640
I'd love to share that with someone

411
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,880
who I might not be able to convince offhand

412
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,940
to listen to the whole darn podcast.

413
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,800
Or me.

414
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,640
Like, I don't know if I want to listen

415
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,000
to the whole darn podcast,

416
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,360
but a lot of times people will clip

417
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,040
some of the best moments in the show.

418
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,300
And I'm like, that was good.

419
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,900
And I go and I subscribe.

420
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,160
And then the other thing that's in here

421
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,560
is the individual clips can get boosts.

422
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,400
So you can like a clip with 10 sats.

423
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,800
And so then you can start looking at the most boosted clips.

424
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,840
And so there's a lot of ways you can sort by it.

425
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,080
And it's a signal that works.

426
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,440
I think it's fascinating.

427
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,560
It's better than I think than Google putting their hands

428
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,340
on that algorithm and promoting things

429
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,340
like NBC News as a podcast.

430
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,180
Anyways, moving on.

431
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,040
John A boosted in with 30,000 sats.

432
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,440
We asked how far behind folks are.

433
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,140
He says, wait, you mean people aren't listening

434
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,640
and boosting the moment a new episode releases?

435
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,800
30,000 sats from John A.

436
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,440
And here's what's incredible about that.

437
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,360
John A's first boost was last week.

438
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,160
Second week, he's now a baller booster.

439
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,120
So thank you, John, for the support.

440
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,960
That is really great.

441
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,760
And then, of course, a frequent baller booster

442
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,240
comes into the show.

443
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,000
And that is, of course, Optimus Gray

444
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,400
coming in with a row of McDucks, 22,222 sats.

445
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,040
Thank you kindly.

446
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,400
He's on board with the Golden Dragon as the LUP mascot.

447
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,120
So we have second approval from an audience member.

448
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,400
I think that means it's official.

449
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,920
Yes, you have the deal right there.

450
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,560
But Golden Dragon needs to make sure he gets a hype song.

451
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,680
He needs a hype song.

452
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,480
So I think that's understandable.

453
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,560
Maybe he gets a licensed hype song.

454
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,160
Maybe something that goes up on the soundboard for when

455
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,400
he boosts in, something like that.

456
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,240
So we'll have to work that out.

457
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,800
But I think it's a great suggestion.

458
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,040
Thank you, Optimus.

459
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,280
And thank you for the support.

460
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,080
If you would like to be a baller and boost into the show

461
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,360
and get your message read in this section,

462
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,520
please send us a baller boost with a new podcast app

463
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,200
at newpodcastapps.com.

464
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,680
And we want to transition into something

465
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,360
that is hard to talk about on the show,

466
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,160
because it often sounds like we're being just critical.

467
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,400
And we're just kind of complaining about something.

468
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,760
But that is not the case.

469
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,440
We love this stuff, right?

470
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,520
But we're invested in it.

471
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,040
And we want to make sure that it's

472
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,940
meeting the needs of users, that it's growing,

473
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,400
that it's adapting for the future, all of those things

474
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,000
that the projects we use are healthy.

475
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,280
If you don't talk about problems,

476
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,320
how can that be the case?

477
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,240
And that's the lens in which we are going

478
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,120
to look at today's segment.

479
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,360
Well, today's segment has been on my mind for, I think,

480
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,160
about a year and a half, maybe more.

481
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,000
And again, it comes from an absolute place of love.

482
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,600
And today, we're talking about some struggles with plasma,

483
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,640
KD's plasma.

484
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,520
I've been a plasma user for, I think,

485
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,480
it's something like five years now.

486
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,400
First started on Anturgos and moved on to Kubuntu.

487
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,440
And gentlemen, I mean, there's some in the studio as well,

488
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,120
some plasma.

489
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,520
And where does it fit in your lives?

490
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,520
Oh, yeah, we use it here in production.

491
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,160
I use it for my main recording OS.

492
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,440
I don't always use it as my sit-on-the-couch OS,

493
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,720
but I definitely put it in places

494
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,920
where I care if it breaks.

495
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,400
Yeah, I think that laptop you're using there is probably

496
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,080
I'm running plasma as we're doing the show right now.

497
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,520
This machine right here is plasma

498
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,360
that I'm sitting in front of.

499
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,560
And then, of course, our OBS machine is plasma.

500
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,400
It's been a really good production work desktop.

501
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,520
Yeah, so clearly lots of plasma love going around here.

502
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,720
And for good reason.

503
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,400
I think it's a desktop environment that

504
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,960
has a ton of features that we love.

505
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,040
It's kind of extensible.

506
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,520
You can modify it to your own needs.

507
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,920
But what I've noticed, and I haven't quite

508
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,120
been able to put my finger on it until just about this last week

509
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,760
or so, what I've noticed for this last year and a half

510
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:17,000
is some changes or maybe some rough edges

511
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,320
that I've noticed in Kubuntu at first, especially around 2204.

512
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,600
But also, that caused me to go looking elsewhere

513
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,120
for some great plasma integrations.

514
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,040
And I got to say, it's been a little rough road for me.

515
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:37,960
So I wanted to explore, I think, the history of Kubuntu

516
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,040
and the history of other spins, like Fedora's spin,

517
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:47,480
and plasma, where it's come from the mid-2000s to now.

518
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,000
And I think there's been some major changes

519
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,880
in how it's been integrated in various distributions.

520
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,800
And we start to ask some big questions like, well, why?

521
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,560
Where's it headed, I think, is really what I want to know.

522
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,880
Because I want it to stick around and be the best it can

523
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,360
be.

524
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,160
So that's an interesting question.

525
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,000
If I think back into the past, I can definitely,

526
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,360
some distributions really stand out.

527
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,440
Soos had a really strong KDE desktop experience.

528
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,440
I seem to recall Mandrake and Mandriva

529
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,360
having a pretty good plasma desktop or KDE desktop

530
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,000
experience at the time.

531
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,560
So I'm curious when you say you've seen a shift over time.

532
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,720
Maybe let's start there.

533
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,040
What do you mean specifically?

534
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,220
Well, I did a little research.

535
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,800
And back in 2007, which if some of you were heavy Linux users,

536
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,720
you may remember this.

537
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,040
But it seems that for the most important distributions,

538
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,200
Red Hat and Fedora had GNOME, Debian, Ubuntu also.

539
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,960
But OpenSUSE, like you said, had KDE as a default desktop.

540
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,120
Mandriva certainly did.

541
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,480
PC Linux OS as well.

542
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,040
And Slackware and Mepis as well.

543
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,480
So that is round five, five or so for KDE

544
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,600
as the top contenders with three or so going to GNOME.

545
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,800
And these days, that's not quite the case.

546
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:09,120
Some distributions have gone to desktop agnostic,

547
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,520
I think I'll call it.

548
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,080
So now you see OpenSUSE just kind of offering KDE or GNOME

549
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,280
or Xfce right in the installer, which is actually

550
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,160
a really nice way to do it.

551
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,540
But you have some popular distributions like Mint,

552
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,280
for instance, that doesn't even offer, well,

553
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,600
either GNOME or KDE.

554
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,600
They've got Cinnamon, Mate, or Xfce as their sort of choices.

555
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,160
But then Ubuntu and Debian has the default.

556
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,080
Well, I think Ubuntu is a special case.

557
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,360
Debian offers choices, but sort of pre-selects a default

558
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,880
as GNOME for you.

559
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,480
But in the corporate arena these days,

560
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,560
I think GNOME is really the contender.

561
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,120
Red Hat, RHEL, CentOS, they've all

562
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,040
had GNOME as sort of the main thrust, and that makes sense.

563
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,520
I mean, they put a lot of work into that development, right?

564
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,400
They're one of the main funders of development, would you say?

565
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,040
There was a time where Unity had made some serious inroads

566
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,120
there, but after Canonical chose to switch back to GNOME,

567
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,840
I think it's really taken the day.

568
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,520
And even when Unity was strong there,

569
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,360
GTK was still kind of the king.

570
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,240
Exactly, yeah.

571
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,040
That's the underlying theme, is GTK has

572
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,480
done really well in that space.

573
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,840
Honestly, I know a few folks who use Linux at work.

574
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,640
I bet they don't even know Plasma exists.

575
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,640
Yeah, and of course, of course, we're

576
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,520
talking a slice of the market.

577
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,800
Obviously, Qt is extremely successful.

578
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,400
It's huge in the enterprise.

579
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,520
We're talking about desktop here.

580
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,040
Yeah, desktop specifically, I think, is pretty accurate.

581
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,480
I think my question then that we're trying to answer

582
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,600
is, are the spins and the flavors just kind

583
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,320
of second-rate citizens, and are they getting enough attention?

584
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,200
Because my sort of anecdotal experience

585
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,800
in the last several weeks, even months, of trying

586
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,240
to suss out this space, trying Neon, for instance,

587
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,680
which is promising.

588
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,480
It offers the latest Plasma on top of really stable Ubuntu

589
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,440
base, which is kind of a nice combination.

590
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,960
So trying that when I was at Alex's place

591
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,000
for the last few months, trying Fedora's spin of KDE

592
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,880
has been an interesting journey.

593
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:21,760
And then just kind of retesting my own assumptions

594
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,480
about what 2204 might offer me, I sort of come

595
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,400
into some struggles, actually, which I don't love.

596
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,520
And I haven't heard that much from either of you.

597
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,360
Have you tried sort of, I think, Chris, you have Neon in front

598
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,680
of you, is that correct?

599
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,600
Yeah, you got it.

600
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,000
You know, when I'm listening, what I'm hearing

601
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,480
is you kind of started going from tried and true

602
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:56,360
stable LTS Plasma to more like modern rolling current Plasma.

603
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,080
And I wonder if what you're seeing

604
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,480
is the difference between kind of these milestone releases.

605
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,760
Carefully gated, kind of curated, right?

606
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,640
Had some time to get that level of polish

607
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,720
and those things ironed out before moving on.

608
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,080
Yeah, although I do run Neon, and I don't really

609
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,400
run into any particular problems,

610
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,160
although my NVIDIA driver is broken at the moment.

611
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,520
So those things do happen.

612
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,800
I feel like my Neon experiences, I

613
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,400
don't know if I'd call them problems, but things kind of

614
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,760
change and go back, right?

615
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,960
Or maybe there's a thing where you notice something crashes

616
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,000
a little bit for a week, but then by the time you've updated

617
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,360
again, it's gone.

618
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,200
So those things show up, but they're not always static.

619
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Yeah, and none of them have been like deal breakers yet.

620
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,840
There's that.

621
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,560
They're more like curiosities, like, oh, that's different,

622
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,040
right?

623
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,200
Right, but I can still get to what I need to get to,

624
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,000
so I'll continue on, and then I'll update in a couple of days.

625
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,760
You also touched on something there, Brent,

626
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,360
that I think could almost be a show topic on its own,

627
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,520
and that is do these spins get the same level of attention

628
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,560
that the main like distro version?

629
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,960
You have Ubuntu proper, right?

630
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,280
You've got Fedora workstation, and then you've got Kubuntu,

631
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,120
and you've got the Fedora KDE spin.

632
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,000
And just like we know the answer.

633
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,240
We know that those spins have less users and less developers,

634
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:19,200
and KDE is now often relegated to spin status or flavor status.

635
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,280
And so I think that means it's often not

636
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,880
getting a complete like all of distro implementation focus.

637
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,400
And that's not to take anything away

638
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,200
from the Kubuntu team or any of the other distro

639
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,760
makers who are making the plasma version of that distro,

640
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,560
but I do think there might be something

641
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:41,400
to your underlying observation in that over time,

642
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,720
the main spin of all of these distros

643
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,880
really is, for the most part, their GNOME spin,

644
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,840
with some exceptions.

645
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,760
And maybe that has altered the implementation

646
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,400
to be less perfect.

647
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,200
I don't know, though.

648
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,600
I really don't know.

649
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,920
I mean, it sort of necessarily does, right?

650
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,840
I mean, KDE feels a little bit now

651
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,800
like it's mainly a community project from what

652
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,280
I've been able to research.

653
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,800
And I'm happy to be wrong about that if someone

654
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,680
has some inside information.

655
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,800
I think they proudly are a community project.

656
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,200
I think that's, you know.

657
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,400
Oh, oh, oh, I don't mean to take away from that.

658
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,040
I think as a community project, it

659
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,240
does some amazing, amazing, amazing things.

660
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,360
But I think because it's not the default of some

661
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,080
of these larger enterprise entities,

662
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,680
it maybe doesn't always get maybe the funding

663
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,640
for the kind of work that we would all love to see it get,

664
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,080
even though it's still a super impressive piece of software.

665
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,040
I think I come at this from the most loving place possible,

666
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,480
which is like, I want this thing to keep being as successful as

667
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,200
it has been.

668
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,960
And I hope that my observations are only

669
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,760
a shift in my own perspective.

670
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,720
You mentioned very astutely that maybe I'm just

671
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,400
looking at sort of more leading edge KDE.

672
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,360
And so I'm finding, of course, as I do,

673
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,900
finding more rough edges in the software.

674
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,160
I hope that's the case, is that I'm the one who has changed.

675
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,480
And KDE is not at all changing and just continuing

676
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,840
to do its wonderful thing.

677
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,920
I hope that's the answer because that

678
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,960
would make me quite happy.

679
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,960
But I just have some worries, I guess is the way to put it.

680
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,920
You know, it's hard to say.

681
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,040
I'd like to get into some of the specifics of what you run into.

682
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,160
Maybe we can kick that around a little bit.

683
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,200
For myself, I have definitely struggled

684
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,440
with plasma implementations when I have different monitors,

685
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,040
different resolutions, and different refresh rates.

686
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,840
And I struggle with that with GNOME as well.

687
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,020
It's just an area where, for me, I'm always

688
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,920
hitting bugs in Linux with.

689
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,040
And I wish that experience was better.

690
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,480
But on the whole, I feel like things are collectively just

691
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,280
getting better overall.

692
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,600
Then there's all these edge cases,

693
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,440
like, well, are you using an NVIDIA card?

694
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,640
Are you on Wayland?

695
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,760
Are you on X11?

696
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,840
Are you on an Intel machine or an AMD machine?

697
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,360
And then things get a little weird.

698
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,840
But I want to know specifically what problems you had.

699
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,080
Yeah, and I think my data isn't necessarily empirical.

700
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,320
And I should have taken a more scientific approach.

701
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,080
However, we've had discussions back and forth

702
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,840
for a few months now about the kinds of problems

703
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,720
I've run into.

704
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,400
And I think some of this was pretty clear

705
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,880
when I was at Alex's place.

706
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,480
He has some pretty new hardware.

707
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,480
I think it was a 3080 or something

708
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,560
he's running over there that had some video issues, especially

709
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,160
with Wayland.

710
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,640
It ended up being nearly unusable.

711
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,440
And I had to switch X11, still had some issues there.

712
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,240
So I think that is partly explained

713
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,880
by some hardware, for sure.

714
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,880
And like you mentioned, I was constantly

715
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,040
having monitor issues.

716
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,400
He has multiple relatively state-of-the-art monitors

717
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,040
and relatively state-of-the-art GPUs as well.

718
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,880
And so I can't point the finger only

719
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,440
at the display manager or anything like that.

720
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,600
I think hardware still does play a huge factor there.

721
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,760
So it's not fair to point the finger only

722
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,000
at one of the things in the pipeline here.

723
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,160
So kudos to you for checking me on that.

724
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,840
Well, no, no.

725
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,520
I mean, it's all like the end user experience, right?

726
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,400
I mean, everyone runs into these problems.

727
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,640
So video monitor issues, anything in particular?

728
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,560
Two out of three times, it would work fine.

729
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,000
The third time, it would wake from sleep, for instance.

730
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,240
One of the monitors would just never turn on.

731
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,920
So I'd have to put it back to sleep

732
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,440
and then hope for the next two out of three.

733
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,560
That was a thing that was occurring specifically

734
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,280
on Alex's system over at his office,

735
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,640
where I would adjust the chair quite frequently.

736
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,440
So that was a slightly annoying one.

737
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,640
But you know what is interesting,

738
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,440
which is sort of moving away from the hardware a little bit

739
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,480
and more some of the Plasma-specific features,

740
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,440
something I got into before that trip,

741
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,600
so before headed to Alex's, here on my local computers

742
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,800
that I've been running Kubuntu on for quite a while

743
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,520
is Plasma has this wonderful concept

744
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,280
of something called activities, which is almost like,

745
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,400
but don't call it this, it's almost like virtual desktops.

746
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,120
But it just is a bit more powerful and more sort

747
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,040
of context-specific, I think it's worth reading into

748
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,080
because it's a great idea.

749
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,080
But I tried it for a few weeks and found a few bugs in it

750
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,560
to the point where it was a little clumsy to use.

751
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,680
And I thought, okay, well, I'm gonna try neon

752
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,280
at Alex's place and we'll try it there again.

753
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,760
And it was even more problematic in the sense

754
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,960
that it's almost like it was this great feature

755
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,440
that got implemented years and years ago that worked great.

756
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,720
But then it just hasn't, it's one of those features

757
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,680
that's a little hidden and not everybody uses it.

758
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,760
And so I feel like maybe there's a little bit

759
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
of entropy there.

760
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,680
And I think that adds to my like, oh, well,

761
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,000
what, how can we fix this?

762
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,680
And I think submitting bugs is certainly a way to do that.

763
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,560
And yep, I can do that and yep, I have done that.

764
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,440
We'll come up with a list in a little bit.

765
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,880
But I admittedly haven't submitted bugs

766
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,680
for every single issue that I ran into

767
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,800
because sometimes it was like two, three, four things piling

768
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,880
on top of each other in the span of trying to get work done

769
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,960
in an hour sort of thing.

770
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,960
So it started getting a little worrisome, I suppose.

771
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,760
But in the studio, Chris, it sounds like you don't run

772
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,600
into any of this.

773
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
So I don't know, is it just me?

774
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,920
This'll derail a little bit perhaps,

775
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,000
but I wanted to give voice, Casey in our chat room

776
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,400
had a thought that I'd kind of wondered a little bit as well.

777
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,080
He's wondering how much of some of this might be Brent

778
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,640
becoming more technically knowledgeable and experienced.

779
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,000
The more you sort of learn what's going on under the covers,

780
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,520
the more you take deeper looks at things,

781
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,160
the more cracks you discover.

782
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,960
And he also here calls out that it's not,

783
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,200
this is mostly just saying,

784
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Brent, you've learned a lot and we all see it.

785
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,600
Oh, thanks.

786
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,560
And I think that's a possibility,

787
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,760
like I'm evolving and that's fine, that's fine.

788
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,640
I wonder, and I didn't want this to be my answer,

789
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,040
but I can't help but feel like maybe this is part of it.

790
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,320
Is those of us who have been schlepping for Linux

791
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,560
for a really long time are maybe willing

792
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,360
to forgive a lot of things.

793
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,320
And like also when things break,

794
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,080
I tend to just move forward and like work around it.

795
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,720
Like I don't stop and I barely even acknowledge the breakage

796
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,520
other than maybe like, ah, this goddamn thing, ah, shit.

797
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,560
And then I'll just move right on.

798
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,640
And it's not, what am I trying to say?

799
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,480
You know what I'm trying to say, Wes?

800
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,760
It's like this mentality of-

801
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,880
I think we're calloused in a way.

802
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,720
Yeah.

803
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,560
Like we're just, we're used to that thing.

804
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,960
We know we're getting this stuff for free.

805
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,120
We don't expect, there's not that,

806
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,440
I mean, some people maybe there is,

807
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,720
but you might get upset about these things,

808
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,120
especially if you've paid an exorbitant amount for software,

809
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,480
but when you just got it gratis and you appreciate how much

810
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,240
and you kind of know what's happening on the backend,

811
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,800
I think, yeah, I'm fairly willing,

812
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,280
if it's not a totally derailing issue,

813
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,240
I'm fairly willing to just say like,

814
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,040
all right, well, I appreciate that.

815
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,240
I could have made that mistake,

816
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,840
or maybe you're trying to improve this,

817
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,160
but it's no longer working for me.

818
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,460
Or it's like you've seen how the sausage is made

819
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,520
so many times that you know how long of a shot it is

820
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,800
that some of these fringe issues

821
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,960
are ever gonna get taken care of.

822
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,920
Like that's not really gonna get fixed

823
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,820
until the entire stack is replaced.

824
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,160
And how often some of the stuff

825
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,440
that looks shallow on the surface

826
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,880
is actually due to like very deep,

827
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,240
complicated interactions between different subsystems.

828
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,960
And you're like, oh, I thought that was just a simple toggle.

829
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,320
And it's like, well, no, these things have long histories

830
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,760
and we gotta maintain compatibility

831
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,140
and it's gonna take mountains of work to fix that.

832
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,220
And sometimes, and I don't like this answer

833
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,480
because I think you always,

834
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,280
everything has to be evaluated on its own.

835
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,720
But sometimes I think to myself,

836
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,560
some of these compromises,

837
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,640
like when I wake my machine up upstairs

838
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,880
and my monitor's just totally all screwed up

839
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,720
and one of them is flickering like it's having a seizure

840
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,260
and the other one, all my windows are rotated

841
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,220
and completely messed up in the wrong spot.

842
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,340
And I do get frustrated and I think,

843
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,440
it's still a better option than running Windows.

844
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,800
I still trust this system more

845
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,200
than I'll ever trust Windows or the Mac.

846
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,020
And I don't deal with some of the other things

847
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,660
on these proprietary systems that drive me crazy.

848
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:28,660
Like I might get a 99% accuracy hit on the Mac

849
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,300
when I wake it up with multiple monitors

850
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,040
and where all the screens are and everything like that.

851
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,300
It might be like 98, 99% accurate almost every time.

852
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,440
But man, is it a nightmare to deal with Mac OS updates.

853
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,080
And does it just waste an entire two hours sometimes

854
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,220
for some unconceivable reason doing some update

855
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,760
that I don't even know what it's actually doing.

856
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,400
And what a hot mess are all the different

857
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,120
self-implemented updaters on Mac OS

858
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,180
and all these little things about the OS

859
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,560
that I never have to deal with on a Linux box.

860
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,720
And it's stuff that slows me down and takes my time.

861
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,500
It's like, I went on a website this morning.

862
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,200
I was looking up some of the smoke conditions around here

863
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:15,020
and I got this big pop-up that says we value your time.

864
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,720
And they had all these questions for me.

865
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,280
And I'm like, you lying bastard.

866
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,240
If you valued my time, you wouldn't be putting this pop-up

867
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,520
in front of my face and stopping me, right?

868
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,840
That's Windows.

869
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,520
Windows is like that, we value your time.

870
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,880
Your answer, your call will be answered in 15 minutes.

871
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,200
Like that's Windows, right?

872
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,120
Where Linux is like there's no call waiting,

873
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,360
there's no hold, you just get on, you get your answer,

874
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,480
you get the job done.

875
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,760
And so I weigh those things higher

876
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,080
than I weigh the niggling issues

877
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,080
that I run into from time to time.

878
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,760
And generally, they're never issues

879
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,280
that prevent me from working, right?

880
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,080
Whereas like the deal with Mac OS updates

881
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,820
and its silly long update process,

882
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,080
that'll stop you from working.

883
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,280
You can't work while the machine's doing that.

884
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,160
Where I can choose a Linux distro

885
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,040
that does updates very quick and very efficiently.

886
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,920
And there's also so many more knobs as well as insight,

887
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,400
like I have a lot more faith that there will be

888
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,000
like a bug report that I'll be able to see at least

889
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,720
that can document or I can contribute

890
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,280
to acknowledge this issue.

891
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,760
You can go look at the source code

892
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,920
and to some extent I feel kind of like a guest in a hotel

893
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,360
on some of those other desktops.

894
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,880
I expect to be catered to because I don't have any options.

895
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,880
Whereas with Linux, it's like your own tool,

896
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,560
it's your own house and sometimes you're pretty upset

897
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,280
because well, you really didn't paint that wall very well

898
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,120
or whatever.

899
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,960
You didn't finish that over there.

900
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,780
You know?

901
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,000
But you can then customize it if you need to.

902
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,400
Or like you could compile your own build to Plasma

903
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,440
if you really wanted to.

904
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,160
I don't think you do, but you could, right?

905
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,240
Or you could just stop updating.

906
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,400
You could stick to a stable branch if you wanted to.

907
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,980
I think we, I don't know, you guys may know,

908
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,340
but I used to work with a PHP developer who did just that.

909
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,300
He would get like whatever the previous LTS was

910
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,000
and he would only use that and only use the software

911
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,920
from that repo and he refused to use anything newer

912
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,400
because of the problems you're having.

913
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,100
And Brent, that was almost a decade ago.

914
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,200
It was like, it's always kind of been the case.

915
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,740
And I think that's where the distros still play a role.

916
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,440
And you've just happened to choose a desktop environment

917
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,720
that maybe some of the major distros aren't focusing on

918
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,360
that are doing the polishing.

919
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,200
Now, I really don't want to take anything away from Plasma

920
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,080
because I think in some ways it's great

921
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,000
that we have something like Plasma out there

922
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,520
that isn't tied to any particular distro

923
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,300
that isn't being led around by Red Hat

924
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,280
or something like that, right?

925
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,880
Like, that's a good thing.

926
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,240
That's also an advantage, yeah, absolutely.

927
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,520
You have been trying to effect change, right?

928
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,840
You have submitted bugs for some of the things.

929
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,800
I mean, and that isn't something you have to do,

930
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,160
but it is an option we have with free software

931
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,000
that we don't necessarily have with the commercial stuff.

932
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,640
Well, and actually what's been great about that process,

933
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,280
and it first started a few months ago

934
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,040
when we were participating in the Ubuntu beta testing,

935
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,120
or at least I did.

936
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,360
Some listeners may have as well, hopefully.

937
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,400
And I did find some bugs doing upgrades

938
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,680
between LTS versions.

939
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,720
And it was actually really refreshing to be like,

940
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,440
hey, I found this thing and I think no one else has found it

941
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,960
or other people have,

942
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,800
but I can share some extra information about it

943
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,760
on my particular steps.

944
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,000
And that was a refreshing perspective

945
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,200
into the way that open source functions.

946
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,720
And what's been really neat is watching,

947
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,000
you automatically get tagged

948
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,480
and track those conversations via email or whatever it is.

949
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,440
And it's been fascinating to watch the discussions

950
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,680
and the progress on some of these bugs throughout the months,

951
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,240
both in a, I think in a good and bad way,

952
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,440
I hesitate to use those words,

953
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,720
but like some of the bugs are deemed,

954
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,760
oh yeah, this is very serious,

955
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,200
needs to be fixed before the release.

956
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,640
And it gets all the attention and it gets solved,

957
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,320
sometimes within a few hours or a few days.

958
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,320
But then some bugs that seem at least to me from,

959
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,000
let's say a slightly technically proficient end user,

960
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,120
some bugs that seem super serious to me

961
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,000
have gone months and months and months and months

962
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,840
without any attention.

963
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,920
Well, some people are paying attention,

964
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,040
but without a fix, I'll say.

965
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,600
So one in particular was,

966
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,200
Kubuntu had a bug where you couldn't enter

967
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,840
like their K-D-E-S-U function.

968
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,600
So where you type in your pseudo password

969
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,160
to bring up, to change some repos or something

970
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,280
in the GUI, for instance.

971
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,040
Yeah, that does seem like a bad one.

972
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,400
Yeah, it would present a dialogue to you

973
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,880
to put in your password, which is all good,

974
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,120
but it would never ever accept any of your passwords,

975
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,480
either the pseudo password or your known good password

976
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,080
as the acceptable answer.

977
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,320
It would just never ever let you in, basically.

978
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,800
And it was just changed some fairly important functions.

979
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,880
So you had to find ways around it.

980
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,520
So I guess seasoned enough that I knew ways around it,

981
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,040
but that seemed like a pretty big issue to me.

982
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,040
And I was like, oh, this definitely needs some attention.

983
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,480
Like this is very serious.

984
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,360
And a potential fix to be tested was only sent out,

985
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:14,280
I think last week, which really surprised me

986
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,440
because we found these back in March, I think it was,

987
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,560
and I'm not the only one to have found this bug.

988
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,480
So it's been really fascinating to watch

989
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,040
sort of the internals of the teams

990
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,040
that are working on these things as well.

991
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,480
So if anyone's interested in getting to learn

992
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,120
the Linux desktop environment on a different level,

993
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,040
I very highly recommend, you know,

994
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,520
go find some bugs and submit some,

995
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,920
or at least go look at some bug reports.

996
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,160
It's an amazing thing.

997
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,000
I'm getting excited.

998
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,320
I'm getting so excited for you, Brent.

999
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,080
This is such an exciting period

1000
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,280
you're going through right now.

1001
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,880
Oh, this is good.

1002
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,760
Well, have you been through this?

1003
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,600
It sounds like.

1004
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,440
Oh, sure, yeah.

1005
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,600
You're gonna get a whole new understanding

1006
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,760
of how free software is put together.

1007
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,520
And I think this is a super valuable understanding.

1008
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,200
Watching this process, what you talked about there,

1009
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,600
watching how the team works,

1010
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,800
seeing what things they go after,

1011
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,960
kind of see who some of the superstars are.

1012
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,840
How do you balance all the competing demands

1013
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,080
and bugs and issues and new features maybe?

1014
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,920
Yeah, yeah.

1015
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,800
Well, what's been even more interesting

1016
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,600
is from our website project,

1017
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,960
where now I've been sort of playing the person

1018
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,320
of the triaging bugs that we get in

1019
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,920
and priorities and stuff like that.

1020
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,600
Now I'm seeing, because of our own open source project

1021
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,640
with a bunch of listeners putting in their time

1022
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,640
and effort when they can on their specialty

1023
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,400
to make our website an amazing thing.

1024
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,520
Now I have the perspective of that other chair

1025
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,800
and that other hat of trying to organize

1026
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,360
all these competing priorities and stuff.

1027
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:44,240
So it has been a really fascinating time for me personally.

1028
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,720
And I think that's what I wanted to share here today

1029
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,920
is like, there's a lot of different ways

1030
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,280
of having perspective on the software that we're using.

1031
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,600
And that's kind of a beautiful thing

1032
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,480
in this open source environment.

1033
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,320
I wanna also take your point to the audience,

1034
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,480
maybe have them boost in with their thoughts.

1035
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,440
Is Plasma maybe getting a second rate implementation

1036
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,520
because it's on these spins and flavors

1037
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,040
and not the primary distro focus so often.

1038
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,120
And again, not to take anything away

1039
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,520
from like Kubuntu teams or Fedora spin team

1040
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,280
because we all use it.

1041
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,760
We love that project.

1042
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,760
We are so thankful for anything.

1043
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,840
We just wish they had more developers.

1044
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,280
And I'm wondering, are we off?

1045
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,800
Just somehow does the free software model

1046
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,200
and the development model for free software,

1047
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,240
does it kind of avoid this problem

1048
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,160
since it's all upstream development?

1049
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,680
Let us know your thoughts, boost it in

1050
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,320
or go to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1051
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,760
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1052
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,760
Go get started with a free trial of teams

1053
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,400
or for an individual right now

1054
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,600
by going to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1055
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,160
Bitwarden is the easiest way for yourself,

1056
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,960
an individual, a team, an open source project

1057
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,800
to share and sync sensitive data.

1058
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,040
It's fully customizable.

1059
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,240
There's all kinds of things that you can tweak,

1060
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,760
you can set, especially for those of you

1061
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,240
in the enterprise environment.

1062
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,360
And of course we love that Bitwarden is open source,

1063
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,040
trusted by millions in the community.

1064
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,360
It's of course what Wes and I use every single day

1065
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,000
for managing our passwords.

1066
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
You can manage your two factor authentication there

1067
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,880
and have it all in one spot.

1068
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,400
And it just syncs beautifully across the desktop

1069
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,160
and across mobile devices.

1070
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,840
And one of the very first things I install now

1071
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,920
when I set up a new Linux box is the Bitwarden Flatpak.

1072
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,760
Then I can get logged into all of my services

1073
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,040
and my sites and I can use secure,

1074
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,120
individual unique passwords for all of them.

1075
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,960
I just kept thinking to myself,

1076
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,040
how much more could Bitwarden do in 2022?

1077
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,760
How much more could they really do?

1078
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,800
They've done so much.

1079
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,240
They've added so many features,

1080
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,640
especially on mobile for both Android and iOS this year.

1081
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,320
And for the enterprise,

1082
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,160
cross domain identity management was huge.

1083
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,200
They just got to that.

1084
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,520
This week they're announcing fast mail alias generation.

1085
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,760
So if you're a fast mail user,

1086
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,440
fast mail has been added to the list of available options

1087
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,560
for generating an email address along Firefox relay

1088
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,840
and on Addy and simple login.

1089
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,760
So now you can have a unique username,

1090
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,960
a unique password and a unique email address

1091
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,640
for every site and service you use.

1092
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,160
That is ultimate security

1093
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,720
and Bitwarden just manages all of it for you.

1094
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,920
They just do it all for you.

1095
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,000
They generate it, they auto fill it, they sync it

1096
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,120
and they do it securely and it's all open source.

1097
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,640
And if you're a fast mail user, this just got real for you.

1098
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,760
I mean, how great is this?

1099
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,280
If you're an existing Bitwarden user, you just get this.

1100
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,200
I love this and I hear from you guys out there all the time,

1101
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,160
how much you love fast mail.

1102
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,200
So I'm super psyched for all of you.

1103
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,600
Bitwarden just keeps getting better.

1104
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,200
If you haven't switched yet or if a friend, a family member

1105
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,280
or maybe your workplace, your school place,

1106
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,720
if you see some practices

1107
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,280
that maybe Bitwarden could help with,

1108
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,320
you know what I'm talking about,

1109
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,960
passwords under the keyboard.

1110
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,840
We've all seen it.

1111
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,080
Give them bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1112
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,120
It's just a great way to support the show

1113
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,440
and get them on the straight and narrow

1114
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,520
to good password management,

1115
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,080
which is probably the number one thing they could do online

1116
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,920
to protect themselves.

1117
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,120
So go to bitwarden.com slash Linux, go try it out.

1118
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,320
The easiest way to sync, store and share sensitive data.

1119
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,520
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1120
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,840
Tater boosts in this week with 2049 cents.

1121
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,720
I'm curious, what did you come up with on the photo front?

1122
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,480
I'm in the exact same boat.

1123
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,840
I have been testing out Synology Photos lately,

1124
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,840
but it really just doesn't cut it.

1125
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,680
The wife is especially unhappy with the lack of AI features

1126
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,760
that allow her to search for things like dog

1127
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,400
or Disney's Animal Kingdom.

1128
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,080
I've been using photo sync on iOS

1129
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,240
to at least get my pictures onto my unread NAS,

1130
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,400
albeit unorganized.

1131
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,680
You know, Tater, we got a lot of feedback about that.

1132
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,760
So what we're gonna do is a kind of roundup

1133
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,880
of some of the stuff that was sent in in the pics.

1134
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,120
And then we'll give you a little more information about it.

1135
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,600
We're gonna try some stuff ourselves

1136
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,560
and then give you like our official final

1137
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,320
like definitive setups for photo sync.

1138
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,560
But yeah, a lot of people had recommended NextCloud

1139
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,560
or they'd recommended PhotoPrism.

1140
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,000
And I did get a few people that said Synology Photos

1141
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,400
actually works well for them.

1142
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,600
So there's, you know, for those of you

1143
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,400
that do have a Synology, there's something to consider.

1144
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,840
Well, we've got a double boost from Tater

1145
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:33,480
with 2,048 SATs.

1146
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,560
Started off with a question there,

1147
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,480
but this one I think is a little pro tip.

1148
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,240
You mentioned the struggles of getting SATs

1149
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,600
into lightning wallets like Fountain.

1150
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,400
And I thought I'd share my recent discovery.

1151
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,160
No, it's not private like RoboSATs, but I like it anyway.

1152
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,600
It's the Cash app.

1153
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,520
I've been a user for years now.

1154
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,840
And I recently found out that their Bitcoin wallet

1155
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,160
in the app supports lightning.

1156
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,680
So sending SATs to Fountain was a piece of cake.

1157
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,360
Cash app's actually a great tip.

1158
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,960
And like right now, they got a boost in there.

1159
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,440
You get 5% back in Bitcoin on any food you buy

1160
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,760
in the Cash app.

1161
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,120
So you could, you know, buy yourself dinner

1162
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,000
and then boost those SATs in.

1163
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,520
You know, I'm constantly having to buy food for some reason.

1164
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,800
I know, it gets old, doesn't it?

1165
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,160
Okay, well, next up is a boost from our beloved Elray.

1166
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,880
Hey Elray, or is it Elry?

1167
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,360
Elry, you're right. Elray, Elry.

1168
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,640
I've just been saying Elray this whole time, so.

1169
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,800
See, I got it, I'm blaming Brett.

1170
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,800
But a solid contributor to our new website.

1171
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,680
Boost in and let us know.

1172
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,120
Oh yeah, absolutely.

1173
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,240
Elray boosts in with a row of ducks.

1174
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,080
Working in the offensive security field,

1175
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,440
I think I mostly agree with Chris's sentiment.

1176
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,000
A lot of antivirus software sucks.

1177
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,640
But there are a few AV or endpoint protection products

1178
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,960
that are actually really awesome, at least for Windows.

1179
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,120
They're working on making Linux better.

1180
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,160
All right.

1181
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,840
Here's a specific example.

1182
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,000
If I see CrowdStrike or a box

1183
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
with an updated Windows Defender,

1184
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,160
I know I have to change my attack pattern

1185
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:09,040
to try and not get caught while I'm on that machine.

1186
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,280
All right, that actually is, you know, I remember that.

1187
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,440
When you see a piece of software, you're like,

1188
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,200
oh, all right, this is gonna be a little harder

1189
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,040
than I expected.

1190
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,560
That probably is the highest praise you could get

1191
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,680
for something like that.

1192
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,200
He kind of sums it up with, you know,

1193
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,240
AV isn't the best, but it's catching low-hanging fruit,

1194
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,880
which is pretty important for non-technical users.

1195
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,880
Sure, sure, that makes sense.

1196
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,360
Along these same lines, Entropic Ninja boosts in

1197
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,920
with a elite number of sets.

1198
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,920
Just listening to the discussion about malware

1199
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,640
and how Mac have integrated it at the OS level.

1200
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,440
To Chris's point about how scanning can tax a system,

1201
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,520
made me think about all those co-processors

1202
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,120
on Apple Silicon.

1203
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,640
Perhaps there might be some specific antivirus co-processors

1204
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,080
introduced in the near future.

1205
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,240
You know, I thought about this while we were talking

1206
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,360
about it in the show last week,

1207
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,320
but I didn't wanna derail us.

1208
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,600
But wouldn't that be the total Apple move,

1209
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,960
is to pretend like your platform was immune

1210
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,520
from malware forever, right?

1211
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,420
And oh, yeah, it's not us.

1212
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,180
Then, when you start to have a malware problem,

1213
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,380
you build it in at the system level, the protection,

1214
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,220
and build in co-processors after that,

1215
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,120
and be like, what, well, yeah, we have malware,

1216
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,560
but it doesn't impact the performance of your system.

1217
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,320
That is exactly what they're gonna do, right?

1218
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,400
Oh, boy, yeah, and you know, you gotta pay

1219
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,920
for those fancy co-processors.

1220
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,120
You get a co-processor, I get a co-processor,

1221
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,880
just all adds to the price.

1222
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,000
Neve boosted in with 2016 SATs.

1223
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,760
Coming in hot with the boost.

1224
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,360
You always get me with that one.

1225
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,560
It's our favorite.

1226
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,420
2016 was when we first heard the phrase,

1227
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,160
the year of the Linux desktop,

1228
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,720
which coincides with when Canonical was at the peak

1229
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,600
of its convergence hype train.

1230
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,000
Do you remember that?

1231
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,440
Ubuntu made the switch to the first LTS with SystemD,

1232
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,880
and had an ongoing phone and smart TV project.

1233
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,180
Manjaro also finally got popular.

1234
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,480
GNOME Shell finally reached usable,

1235
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,520
and Steam proved the test of time,

1236
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,660
lasting the four-year test,

1237
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,600
and showed the community Valve was in the long run

1238
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,640
with the Steam Machine and SteamOS 1.0.

1239
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,320
My last bit of history boosts, by the way.

1240
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,400
Neve, I loved your history boosts.

1241
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,280
What a wild year the 2016 was.

1242
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,600
I'm gonna miss the history boosts.

1243
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,560
I want more history boosts.

1244
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,120
Yeah, keep those coming.

1245
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,520
That was really fascinating.

1246
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,160
Steam 1.0 2016 seems like both,

1247
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,520
like Steam for Linux just happened yesterday,

1248
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,240
and I also feel like it was a decade ago.

1249
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,240
The thing for me, the personal story about Steam on Linux

1250
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:46,000
is that I heard it from Michael Larble

1251
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,800
and somebody else that I won't name,

1252
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:52,340
six months to nine months before it came to Linux,

1253
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,820
but I didn't know when.

1254
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,860
I just knew they were working on it,

1255
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,780
and I'd seen some really solid evidence.

1256
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,140
I didn't know if it was shipping,

1257
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,980
but I knew they had a client.

1258
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,620
I had seen screenshots.

1259
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,460
I had seen source code.

1260
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,140
I knew it was real.

1261
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,900
I just never knew if we were gonna get a product.

1262
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,420
I didn't know when or anything like that,

1263
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,100
so to me, so much of my experience

1264
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,740
about Steam coming to Linux

1265
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,920
was the anticipation of when,

1266
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,980
and trying to do that math and keep my mouth shut,

1267
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,580
but then also drop hints on air.

1268
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,220
So it feels like it was a real time.

1269
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,380
2016 was a solid year for Linux.

1270
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,600
That's all I know.

1271
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,140
Eric Pardee boosted in with 15,000 sats.

1272
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,900
B-O-O-S-T.

1273
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,340
Chris, I think this one's for you on some documentation.

1274
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,700
They write, readme.md, Chris,

1275
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,180
and todo.md, saves my bacon

1276
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,820
when I write ansible, terraform,

1277
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,800
future nix, ooh, I like that.

1278
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,620
Comments are great, good commit messages are also great,

1279
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,740
but a readme.md with how does this all work again notes

1280
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:56,140
that gets the overall gist is invaluable.

1281
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,100
Yeah, that is good advice.

1282
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:01,400
Readme.mds and todo.mds, always really invaluable.

1283
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,040
What about, but hold on, we gotta back up.

1284
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,220
What is, what is Pulumi?

1285
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,720
The next Nix.

1286
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,780
Is this like an ansible meets Nix meets something else?

1287
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,180
Ooh, a little sneaky.

1288
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:14,340
Oh, I think those are separate items, I believe.

1289
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,140
It's Pulumi, which is an existing thing,

1290
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,100
and then I think future Nix may be to imply

1291
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,740
that Eric will be trying out Nix soon.

1292
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:21,560
Well, Eric.

1293
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,400
That's how I understood it.

1294
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,500
Okay, thank you for the sage advice.

1295
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,380
I will take that to heart.

1296
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,540
I will try, I will write future Chris readmes.

1297
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,940
You know, like, and I'll put in there like,

1298
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,340
you really actually need to read this.

1299
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,660
You know, I'll put it in the title so I know it's from me

1300
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,780
and not some jerk.

1301
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,260
Be kind to yourself, Chris.

1302
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,820
It's kind of like the difference between like,

1303
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,140
you know, having a reference where you need

1304
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,060
the specific detail, which is where those comments are,

1305
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,940
like, oh, don't forget, you don't need to do it this way

1306
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,260
or it'll break.

1307
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,320
And then the readme is that high level thing

1308
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,840
where you're just like, what's the intention

1309
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,900
from the user, the human view?

1310
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,500
And then you can get into the specifics later.

1311
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,380
That's good to know.

1312
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,660
All right, thank you, Eric, and thank you

1313
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:59,780
for that healthy boost of 15,000 sats.

1314
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:04,780
The Muso, the Muso boosted in with 5,000 sats.

1315
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,060
Talking about Unity got me thinking

1316
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:11,300
about the one thing I miss, the menu bar.

1317
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:15,340
I love GNOME, but the move away from the menu bar saddens me.

1318
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,240
As a keyboard heavy user, the menu bar allowed me

1319
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,540
to quickly access functions that did not have

1320
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,340
a keyboard shortcut assigned.

1321
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:25,020
A simple Alt plus key and another key later,

1322
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,380
I could use a function.

1323
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:30,500
My opinion, the hamburger menus are not the answer.

1324
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,520
Sure, I could probably use KDE, but for various reasons,

1325
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,460
I prefer GNOME and the GTK ecosystem.

1326
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:41,020
I do not like the hamburger menu still.

1327
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,940
The overflow menu, as it's called now,

1328
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:47,300
and Apple's all in on it.

1329
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,580
The Home Assistant project just redesigned

1330
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,780
their automations UI in Home Assistant,

1331
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,840
and they've helpfully added many things

1332
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,880
to the overflow menu.

1333
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,860
It just feels like the ultimate UI lazy button.

1334
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,220
Ah, well, we couldn't figure out where to put these things,

1335
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:06,240
so one giant menu.

1336
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,620
You know, what's unfortunate is our website has one.

1337
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,740
Yeah, sure, of course, of course.

1338
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:12,580
This everything does.

1339
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,420
It's so handy.

1340
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:16,300
Everything it does, everything does.

1341
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,580
Everything has the hamburger menu now,

1342
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,140
and I just can't even with it.

1343
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,240
And I think part of it is because you can't put everything

1344
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,480
on the toolbar or whatever, right, for this stuff.

1345
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,620
You gotta, but there's still functions they wanna add.

1346
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:30,780
Ah, I feel that one.

1347
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,600
I'm just always struck whenever I go and use

1348
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,020
like old school Windows, you know,

1349
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:37,220
and like the Alt plus key is everywhere.

1350
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,580
I mean, you could just keyboard drive

1351
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,020
so many of those apps that way,

1352
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,900
and it's actually quite nice.

1353
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,540
That's my one good thing of Windows for the years.

1354
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:45,940
Okay, okay, I'll stop.

1355
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,740
I do agree, and consistently too,

1356
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:51,740
like the Windows keyboard shortcuts I learned years ago,

1357
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:54,300
I think for the most part are still valid, right?

1358
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,520
Most plasma apps too.

1359
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,020
It's really the Gnome stuff.

1360
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:57,860
Yeah.

1361
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,220
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1362
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:02,660
All right, Gene being boosted with 15,000 SATs.

1363
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,900
He has two thoughts on open sourcing sound bites.

1364
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:08,780
Number one, be sure to use Git Elfs.

1365
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:09,700
What's a Git Elf, guys?

1366
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,260
Pardon?

1367
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:15,300
Hey guys, hey Brent, you're a GitHub guy now.

1368
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,060
You're a big GitHub guy now, Brent.

1369
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:20,500
Hey Brent, Brent, what's a Git Elf?

1370
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,340
What's a Git Elf, Brent?

1371
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,300
What is that?

1372
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,780
I think it's like, sort of like the paperclip guy in the.

1373
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:27,740
Huh?

1374
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,340
It's sort of like the paperclip guy.

1375
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,660
Clippy, yeah, that's the one.

1376
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,100
It just like, whenever you need help,

1377
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,300
you just hit the button,

1378
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,340
and it comes out and tries to help you.

1379
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,580
It's a little Linus Torvalds, but it looks like an elf.

1380
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,980
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1381
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,460
You're right, I should be using that.

1382
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,340
That's a great tip, Gene being, thank you.

1383
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,660
I should be using that.

1384
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,100
Okay, so reading between the lines here.

1385
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,140
It's LFS, and that's large file support,

1386
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,900
which is a sort of add-on to Git,

1387
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,620
because it's not really designed to support

1388
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,540
giant binary files necessarily.

1389
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,660
So there's ways to integrate those in,

1390
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,980
a little better handling into the mix.

1391
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,100
Oh, links.

1392
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,100
You just use a link.

1393
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:00,940
You just link it.

1394
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,100
But can I get this Linus Elf thing?

1395
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,100
Because that sounds great.

1396
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,420
Number two, should be careful

1397
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,700
about the copyright side of things.

1398
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,960
Yes, that's true.

1399
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:10,800
It's a balance.

1400
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,140
It's been a balance between the fun of it all

1401
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,380
and the copyright of it all.

1402
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,220
So I feel like we need to find the right balance.

1403
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,660
So far, we've been leaning heavily on the fun side.

1404
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,220
Gene Bean had a few extra boosts.

1405
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,040
I love it.

1406
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,280
Gene Bean's a great supporter of the show,

1407
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,060
and I read some of those in the pre-show.

1408
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,400
Alex Gates, the podcasting 2.0 consultant,

1409
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,420
boosted with $15,000.

1410
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,500
We got some $15,000s, woo!

1411
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,340
That is great.

1412
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,160
You know what you all are?

1413
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,020
You're all back home ballers,

1414
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,020
but I'm not gonna play it.

1415
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,580
Okay, one more time for you all together.

1416
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:42,580
But that's it.

1417
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,420
That's it.

1418
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,620
Never again.

1419
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:52,260
But we had some solid $15,000 boosts.

1420
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,860
I felt like they deserved it.

1421
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:58,620
Alex says that we're working on podcasting 2.0 playlists

1422
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,540
that anyone can make and share,

1423
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,780
and then shows up as an RSS feed.

1424
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:04,620
What?

1425
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,420
That's a great idea.

1426
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,580
Frickin' love it.

1427
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:10,260
You know, I would love to do all of our episodes

1428
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:14,180
where we talk about managing and owning your own data,

1429
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,180
just like a whole self-sovereign data series

1430
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,020
of living some life.

1431
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,860
I mean, tags could just be playlists in that way, right?

1432
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,460
You just blew my mind.

1433
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,380
Keep us posted, Alex.

1434
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,260
Please do.

1435
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,820
Thor 502 boosted in.

1436
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:27,780
I think we screwed up with the 2048 stats.

1437
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,420
Just a heads up, guys.

1438
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,300
Wooden, who boosted in last week,

1439
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,820
is another way to say Odin.

1440
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,420
Yeah, you know the Allfather?

1441
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,060
It's Wo-Din.

1442
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:41,260
My dad didn't hang upside down in Yagisal.

1443
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,100
How do you say that?

1444
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:42,920
Ictrazil?

1445
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:43,760
Ictrazil.

1446
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:48,740
For nine days and nine nights to be referred to as lumber,

1447
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,380
as funny as that might be to you.

1448
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:51,220
Oh.

1449
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,840
Sorry, Thor.

1450
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,680
You got us wrong.

1451
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,540
I'm glad Thor has a podcasting 2.0 app.

1452
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,460
You know, Thor's going to new podcast apps.

1453
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,140
He's got himself a podcasting 2.0 app.

1454
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,380
You know, if he doesn't want to switch apps,

1455
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,580
he's sticking with Breeze or Boost CLI.

1456
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,600
Maybe he's using Albee, you know?

1457
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,440
I don't know what Thor's doing.

1458
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,300
Let us know, Thor.

1459
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,140
What's worked for you?

1460
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:07,980
Thor's pretty hip.

1461
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:08,860
That's what I hear.

1462
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,940
I wouldn't have thought.

1463
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,100
But you know, I suppose it makes sense

1464
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,820
when you think about it from like a math standpoint.

1465
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:18,300
He knows about newpodcastapps.com.

1466
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,800
He knows about that.

1467
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,140
Thank you everybody who did boost in.

1468
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:25,580
We got 11,000 stats from Forged Foe,

1469
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:26,860
but he didn't have a message.

1470
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,340
But we also wanted to thank Patrick

1471
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,740
for sending a row of ducks into the show,

1472
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,460
as well as everybody else who boosted in.

1473
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,260
We read all of your messages,

1474
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:35,620
and we're just kind of selectively picking the ones

1475
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,380
that really float our boat to put in the show,

1476
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,420
some make into the pre-show,

1477
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,560
then of course those baller boosts

1478
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,340
make it to the top of the show.

1479
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:44,060
And all of them help keep podcasting independent.

1480
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,060
Thank you everybody.

1481
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,780
Guys, we got an over-packed pick segment.

1482
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,860
We got a pop and picks segment over here.

1483
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,980
We wanted to kind of run through some of the ideas

1484
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,420
that were sent in for getting your photos

1485
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,340
off of your mobile device and onto your own system

1486
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,300
so you can back them up and display them.

1487
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,740
Number one with a bullet, Photosync came in,

1488
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,580
which is an app for iOS and Android.

1489
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:09,500
Thornbill, amongst others, sent them in to let us know,

1490
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,140
hey, you gotta try these out.

1491
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,840
And this is definitely one that you'll be hearing more about

1492
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,620
from us, I think, in the future.

1493
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,580
Photosync lets you transfer your photos

1494
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,900
and your videos from your machine, cross-platform,

1495
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,220
and it supports all kinds of backend network services.

1496
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,980
So pretty much anything you're doing,

1497
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:29,980
WebDAV, SMB, DropBizzle, I don't know what you're using,

1498
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:32,060
but it supports it, it's ridiculous.

1499
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,200
So that was sent in by a lot of folks.

1500
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,120
iDrive also was sent in.

1501
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,860
Another one of the kind of the same dealios,

1502
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:42,420
multi-computer cloud backup, get it off your device.

1503
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,300
The pricing is there.

1504
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,980
It's kind of expensive, but people were using it,

1505
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,300
so I thought I would mention it.

1506
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,580
Hey, photos are important.

1507
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:54,700
Same thing was mentioned, was boosted in by iBookie.

1508
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:58,060
He said, I have a server with PhotoPrism and SyncThing.

1509
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:00,620
SyncThing copies the photos from the phone to the server,

1510
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,780
and PhotoPrism imports and displays them

1511
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,820
from the SyncThing directory.

1512
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:05,660
I like that a lot.

1513
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,740
Yeah.

1514
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,820
SyncThing is not available for iOS.

1515
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,460
I have had good luck in the past using it

1516
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,980
to sync my photos on Android, though.

1517
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,020
Foldersync was also sent in.

1518
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,900
Purple Dog using Breeze sent that in with a row of ducks.

1519
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,860
It says, I'm using Foldersync on Android

1520
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:21,380
and then PhotoPrism as the progressive web app.

1521
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:22,680
What I'm really missing, though,

1522
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,140
is the ability to share an album.

1523
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:29,180
So Foldersync is an Android option.

1524
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:33,180
Photosync is an iOS and Android option.

1525
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,620
And PhotoPrism is the app that a lot of people

1526
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:38,460
are using to display them, but not everybody.

1527
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,540
There's a lot here, and we got a lot of emails about this.

1528
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,060
Here's what I'd like to know.

1529
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,820
We'd like some hands-on experience examples.

1530
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,940
We want to take in a lot of the feedback,

1531
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,420
kind of have the audience give us

1532
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,520
their reports on using things like Photosync

1533
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,380
and Foldersync and PhotoPrism.

1534
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,220
Yeah, what worked well,

1535
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,140
what let you down in a critical moment.

1536
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:59,460
Yeah, what went wrong, how did you recover,

1537
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:00,740
those kinds of stories.

1538
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:04,220
You can boost them in or go to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1539
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:05,840
We want to try to collate as much of that

1540
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,300
so we can kind of get some meta observations

1541
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,160
that we can use to inform our commentary,

1542
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,260
and then we want to come back to you guys

1543
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:15,380
and tell you what apps we picked for our photo solutions

1544
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,680
and what worked, what didn't work,

1545
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,580
and if we can, give as much step-by-step instruction

1546
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,300
as we can on a podcast.

1547
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,980
So that's kind of where we want to take this segment

1548
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:26,580
ultimately, and just kind of gonna be driven

1549
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:28,520
by how much input we get from you guys.

1550
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,700
We have some, we've gotten some good stuff.

1551
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,300
I'd like a little bit more in terms of actual

1552
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,580
hands-on usage and some horror stories.

1553
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,460
And also if you ended up going back to Google Photos,

1554
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:39,660
tell us what went wrong and why and that kind of stuff.

1555
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:40,740
All that would be really valuable

1556
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,500
because that's all experience that we can then use

1557
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,340
to inform our commentary and relate to the audience

1558
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,960
because we'd like to create a definitive

1559
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,180
take control of your photos,

1560
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,380
get away from Google Photos episode

1561
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,660
that people can get referred to.

1562
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:55,160
Because we gotta do it, we gotta do it.

1563
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,000
We gotta do it.

1564
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,180
I mean, if not us, who?

1565
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,340
Who?

1566
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:59,420
Who?

1567
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:00,660
It's just time.

1568
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:01,500
I think it's time.

1569
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,340
We waited too long and now we gotta double down on it.

1570
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:07,340
So let us know how it's worked, how it hasn't worked,

1571
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,660
the good and the bad.

1572
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:12,460
And of course, don't forget next Sunday

1573
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,500
is our last live stream in the studio

1574
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,660
before we hit the road.

1575
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,040
Brent's gonna be here.

1576
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,020
We should think about food.

1577
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:20,740
Oh, I think we must feast.

1578
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:22,780
Yeah, we're gonna have to feast.

1579
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,500
We're gonna be putting on quite the show.

1580
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,380
Maybe we just live stream all day, I don't know.

1581
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:27,500
It's gonna be weird, you know?

1582
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,540
I mean, you're gonna be up here in Seattle.

1583
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:30,620
We're gonna be gone.

1584
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:33,940
We're gonna be having a great time, you know?

1585
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:34,780
I'm already feeling that.

1586
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:37,300
You're gonna be stuck here at the studio.

1587
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:38,900
You know, it's gonna be weird.

1588
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,940
But I'll have full control of the soundboard.

1589
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:44,260
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1590
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:46,420
We finally fired your soundboard guy.

1591
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:48,220
You're cut off.

1592
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:49,540
It's been a lot better.

1593
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:52,700
Been noticing a lot less rust sound bites, that's why.

1594
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:53,980
That soundboard guy brought the rust clip

1595
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,360
and that was it, and that's all he ever did.

1596
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,380
I don't know what kind of hire that was.

1597
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,740
He's worth the salary, let me tell you.

1598
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,060
I don't know about that.

1599
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:00,160
But we'd love to see you next week.

1600
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,020
We do it at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern

1601
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:02,980
over at jupyter.tube.

1602
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,660
That is our self-hosted Peertube instance.

1603
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:05,940
See you next week.

1604
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:08,460
Same bad time, same bad station.

1605
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:11,820
And don't miss Linux Action News.

1606
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:14,060
We covered some underwater Linux data centers

1607
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:15,740
that are going live in our backyard

1608
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:17,100
here in the Pacific Northwest,

1609
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,560
and everything else going on in the world

1610
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,000
of Linux and free software.

1611
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,180
There's a whole other companion to this show.

1612
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:24,700
It's tight, concise, just the information you need.

1613
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,620
LinuxActionNews.com.

1614
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:27,820
Links to what we talked about today,

1615
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:31,180
that's at LinuxUnplugged.com, slash, 475,

1616
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,560
and of course, at the new website, too.

1617
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,020
Over at jupyterbroadcasting.com.

1618
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:36,820
Go check that sucker out.

1619
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,580
It's a doozy.

1620
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,740
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

1621
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,080
of the Unplugged program.

1622
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:46,600
I think we're gonna see you right back here next Sunday.

1623
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,440
Hey.

1624
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:24,200
I think we should spread the love just a little bit.

1625
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:29,280
You did try out Gnome after having some plasma frustrations.

1626
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,560
Ooh, that could be a good title.

1627
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,080
Plasma frustrations.

1628
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,520
And so we said, all right, okay, Brent.

1629
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,520
Okay then, Brent.

1630
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:37,520
All right, Brent.

1631
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,520
Go try out Gnome.

1632
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,520
See how that goes for you, Brent.

1633
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,520
How did it go for you, Brent?

1634
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:46,480
Yeah, I think we decided that was it last Sunday when we were thinking about this episode

1635
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:51,920
and we thought, okay, well, it's only fair to go try the dark side.

1636
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,680
You know, I haven't actually, here's, here's something, I've never actually spent much

1637
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,480
time in Gnome because I've been so happy with, with plasma.

1638
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:06,760
So I only have like, at most hours in Gnome before this.

1639
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,720
But Chris, you put it to me and you, I know, I know.

1640
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,720
But Chris, you put it to me and you said, well, give it a shot for like a week and see

1641
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,720
what happens.

1642
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,040
And I did, and it was enlightening so far.

1643
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:21,080
Unfortunately it wasn't, I was expecting it to be a polished, wonderful experience.

1644
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:28,480
Now I did choose Fedora's Gnome implementation because I figured, okay, at the time on my

1645
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:34,320
main laptop here, I've got Fedora's implementation of KDE, so I thought, okay, well, let's change

1646
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:39,600
the fewest things possible and just switch to, you know, the Gnome desktop environment.

1647
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,600
All right.

1648
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,600
That makes sense.

1649
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:46,480
Maybe than my previous experiences trying to change only one variable.

1650
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:52,440
And I ran into a lot of problems, a ton of problems, many, many, many, many bugs that

1651
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:58,520
helpfully the Gnome bug reporter helped me file a whole bunch of them.

1652
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:04,400
But one of the ones that was worrying was the kernel core had 15 occurrences of problems,

1653
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,160
system failures, it called it, that were just kept getting collected and collected.

1654
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:14,760
I had some random abrupt black screens that would just happen in the middle of, you know,

1655
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:18,840
I'm in the middle of working on the website and all of a sudden, you know, I've written

1656
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:24,200
this whole like a reply to someone or a new issue and it's like paragraphs long.

1657
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:29,000
And all of a sudden my system just like vanished before my eyes and I couldn't do anything

1658
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
to, you know, I couldn't use the keyboard to get to a terminal.

1659
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,680
I couldn't even put it to sleep or anything to try to like.

1660
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,920
That sounds like Mudder or Wayland is crashing on you.

1661
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:45,560
Yeah, it was Wayland and I had some extra issues with Wayland, which I've experienced

1662
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:49,440
on other Wayland systems, which is poor video playback.

1663
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,480
But you were primarily X11 before, right?

1664
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,240
On your Plasma, in your Plasma days?

1665
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,240
Yeah.

1666
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:59,640
So this is always, this is also a little bit new Wayland territory for me as well.

1667
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,160
But I've been disappointed, to be honest.

1668
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:05,360
That's kind of what I was getting at in the show is what I think makes this tricky is

1669
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:11,560
if you look back over the last five, six years of Linux, you've gone through so many transitions

1670
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:15,200
that like it's hard to say where in the stack you're actually bumping problems that maybe

1671
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,240
on an older system, you know, you didn't.

1672
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:24,920
Although I got to tell you, like if I ever, if I ever had what you're going through happen

1673
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:28,600
to me more than once, I would not use any of these systems.

1674
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,600
Like that would be it.

1675
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,920
I don't got time for that.

1676
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:36,120
I know that's, and that's how I started feeling this week was like, I almost put up my hands

1677
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,720
and just said, you know, it's, it's only Thursday.

1678
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,600
I didn't even make it to Sunday again.

1679
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,720
And I can't do this anymore.

1680
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:44,440
I wonder how this is going to go on the dev one.

1681
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,600
Well that I'm interested.

1682
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:46,900
Could this be hardware?

1683
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,480
Could some of this be hardware?

1684
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:55,520
Like potentially I, so one of the main systems I'm using here is an X250 and okay, Alex and

1685
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,620
I like Frankenstein this thing, but it's been pretty stable.

1686
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:03,600
And then my workstation as well was what I was using gnome on because I didn't quite

1687
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,600
want to wipe this.

1688
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,980
I was really hesitant to do that, uh, especially with the travels coming up.

1689
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:12,840
And so I ran it on a completely different system and uh, so yeah, it could be hardware.

1690
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,120
They're both old dish.

1691
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:18,520
They don't have that much cat hair in them, but it could be, you know, that's a possibility.

1692
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:22,840
I was just wondering if you'd like the, I mean, not that pops totally made for that,

1693
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:26,720
but you know, in the, in a system that's sort of a little more integrated and not coupled

1694
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,000
together, it might be something up your alley.

1695
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,360
You mean the pop gnome experience?

1696
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,360
Yeah.

1697
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:33,480
I was thinking he might like the pop gnome or the Ubuntu gnome experience.

1698
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:38,680
Cause the thing about Fedora is it's a real upstream experience, right?

1699
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:41,760
So you're getting basically factory gnome.

1700
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:46,800
And I like that because then I know I add these 17 extensions and everything's fine,

1701
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:51,160
but you don't have, you know, literally six years or so of playing around with various

1702
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,820
extensions to know which ones just to go to, right?

1703
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:58,480
That to me is just built in knowledge now, um, where something like, you should publish

1704
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,360
a feed of the extensions you're currently using.

1705
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:05,120
I wish that's where something like pop and Ubuntu, you know, they've done a little curation

1706
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,440
in that experience.

1707
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:11,860
Well, that's, what's really fascinating to me is I feel like, at least for me personally,

1708
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:15,600
when I jump on a plasma machine, I'm, I don't really need to add anything.

1709
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:20,320
It's got most of the things I want, but it's got more than any desktop environment has.

1710
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,320
It's got everything.

1711
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,320
Yeah.

1712
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,320
Fair enough.

1713
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,320
Yeah.

1714
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:28,360
And also I'm aware that I have, you know, five years worth of experience with it.

1715
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:32,040
So of course I'm going to lean towards preferring the thing that's familiar, right?

1716
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,200
That I have in mind as well.

1717
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:40,160
But you know, you have sort of convinced me that you've been happier with gnome more now

1718
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,160
than ever.

1719
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,160
Yeah.

1720
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,160
Yeah, I have.

1721
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,160
Yeah.

1722
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,440
That's sort of why I lean towards using the fedora implementation was that you seem really

1723
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:46,600
happy with it.

1724
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:51,300
You did hesitate with like wanting to give me the, the preset up version, which is sort

1725
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:54,920
of what pop pop is doing and what, you know, who Bunty is doing.

1726
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:58,400
Uh, I just went crazy and figured, okay, well I'm just going to try it just the way it is

1727
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,240
cause I want to see it from the ground up.

1728
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,640
And that I did that I did.

1729
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,640
Yeah.

1730
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,720
I wonder if you saw my set up, what you'd think of it.

1731
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,720
You might soon.

1732
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:07,720
Yeah, you will.

1733
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,720
Yeah.

1734
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:09,960
I'm curious what you're going to throw on the dev one for me.

1735
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:10,960
Yeah.

1736
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:16,080
Well, we have, we have a little something to start with, don't we have that USB here

1737
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,080
today.

1738
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:24,560
This should be entertaining, so I think we have a whole episode dedicated to these shenanigans.

1739
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:51,120
Is that how it's going?
