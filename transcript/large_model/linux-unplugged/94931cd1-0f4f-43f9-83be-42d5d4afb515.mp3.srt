1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
Oh, I'm glad I'm glad you're comfortable poppy. I'm glad you're comfortable shall we relay his best wishes so Barton

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,760
Popey says hello

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,760
True supporter and I and I appreciate that

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,320
Just not enough to get off his butt and join us

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:28,240
This is Linux Unplugged episode 179 for January 10th, 2017

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's looking at some new rigs and thinking I could spend some Bitcoin on that

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,840
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,320
Are y'all warmed up for today's episode? I think so. It's just a wonderful day filled with podcasting

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,240
It's it's on it's very unusual that I'm sitting at the mic with

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,680
Co-host who's already recorded one more show than I have for the day. So you're ahead of me right now

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,120
You're gonna beat me today. You're gonna let me even well, that's right

12
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,480
Yeah, cuz that you never saw coming doing a double but that's not we're here to talk about today coming up on this week's episode of

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,800
The unplugged program you may be familiar with a name out there Barton George

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,560
Perhaps that rings a bell he comes from Dell and he's specifically in the Sputnik project and they have some new hard world

15
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,160
We'll be chatting with him very soon about some of the new things coming up and yeah

16
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,200
Yeah, we're gonna get our drool on and then later on in the show

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,280
Raspberry Pi wants to be your new Linux distro. Yeah, I mean the Raspberry Pi folks. They have a distro

18
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,120
They want you to run me on your PC not your high your desktop

19
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,120
Well, we'll tell you about that plus the new Linux ransomware that not only is insanely expensive

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,840
But then apparently it's just deleting your data anyways

21
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Everybody's freaking out about kill disk

22
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,500
So we'll see the grill disk is a big issue and then because the universe likes to reward me

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,460
Not one but two predictions of 2017 are already gonna get checked off that I made on Sunday's Linux action show later on the show

24
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,600
We're gonna talk more about Mac exodus. Yes. I know that terms obnoxious and

25
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,040
Some market details that bode very very very well for Linux

26
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:21,020
Before we go any further though. We can't really start the show without bringing in our mumble room time appropriate greetings mumble room

27
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,680
Doesn't it just fill your heart

28
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,680
I feel like we can still officially say happy new year to the mobile room. Happy new year. Happy new year again

29
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Well, let's start off right

30
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,760
Thank you. Let's start right off the top by welcoming Barton to the show Barton. Welcome to Linux unplug

31
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,880
Thanks so much for having me now Barton

32
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,120
You work down there at this company that some folks may have heard of before called Dell and there is love

33
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:58,580
There's the skunkworks operation down there where these crazy kids are doing Linux machines and it's it's really developed into quite a

34
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,480
Well what now appears to be an ecosystem of hardware?

35
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,380
So Barton I am I am really really excited because this is the big story of the week in my estimation

36
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:14,660
Today Dell is announcing some machines that are coming soon or recently has announced machines that are coming soon and a new workstation

37
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,420
I think it's like a mobile workstation like a big old laptop or something

38
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,140
Tell me all about the new hardware and what you're excited about Barton. Well, thank you very much

39
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:28,100
So anyway, this is Barton George from Dell as you said, it's really great to be here. I know back on

40
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,460
Episode 136 you talked about some of the previous generations

41
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:39,360
so it's great to actually be here to talk about on myself and so the news you're talking about now is the

42
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:48,200
Announcement of the precision lineup and those are our mobile workstations and it's actually the second generation of those that have been

43
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,640
enabled with

44
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Ubuntu and the other the

45
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,840
The thing that we're adding to the pie this time is the all-in-one

46
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,960
So that's something that we had not had before the 5720 for those of you who are keeping count

47
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,720
And so that will be that's new

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,020
and then just to if I just take us a trip down memory lane to begin with as you

49
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,000
You alluded to this is a skunkworks project that started about four and a half years ago

50
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,760
and what this was

51
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,880
There was an incubation fund in the company trying to get

52
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,120
Wacky ideas out of people's heads. So

53
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,680
What I did was I said, hey someone had this idea of let's do a Linux laptop. I thought originally great idea

54
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,240
It'll never fly in Dell given the the low volumes relative

55
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,800
What sort of precipice there is there Linux users within Dell that just was sort of side loading Linux on to Dell hardware and thought boy

56
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,960
We could make this great. So there was some enthusiasm the company what what kicked that off? No, it was really if any

57
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,960
You know Steven O'Grady from Red Monk

58
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,480
he was the one we were chatting with him about hey, how can Dell do a better job of

59
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,720
Reaching out to the developer audience because that's one of the we had done well in

60
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,780
From a server point of view outfitting the all the big companies that you're familiar with with servers

61
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:21,120
but as servers become commoditized how else might we look to to add value and and the idea there was let's let's appeal to

62
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,500
Developers and so that's where the idea came about. Well, why don't we try and do?

63
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,020
Linux based laptop

64
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,740
And and so is when Steven mentioned it. I thought you know great idea. It'll never happen

65
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,460
twofold one is because

66
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,660
That the volume they're gonna ask it for is gonna say hey

67
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,100
That's what we do and you know in Belgium on Tuesday between three and four in the afternoon, right?

68
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,940
And that's not really how how we're geared as a company to do

69
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,300
The other thing is we didn't have very good-looking hardware at that point

70
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,820
So I didn't know if that would be something that the developers would would cotton to so

71
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,500
As I've mentioned there was this incubation program. I came and

72
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,980
Presented to them said here's this idea of let's doing a do a Linux laptop. And in the meantime

73
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,100
Also, we started with the new real good-looking XPS 13s. So the two of them together

74
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:22,580
I got the the green green light and was given a tiny pot of money and six months

75
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,460
To see with this thing fly would anyone be interested in in getting one of these?

76
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,460
So the the idea from the beginning too was let's do this all out in the open

77
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:38,140
And so made the initial announcement of our our plan on my blog saying hey, you know what?

78
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,140
We don't even know if this will ever become

79
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,380
a real product

80
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,540
But if you tell us what you want and maybe if we get enough positive feedback

81
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:53,700
It really will become a real boy. And that's that's how we we went about it. And then we got so much positive feedback

82
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:59,660
We ended up turning this into a real product and we launched first with the XPS 13

83
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,540
developer edition

84
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,980
It was now four years ago back in November

85
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,500
So the timing on that the timing on that seems to be extremely fortuitous because it's position Dell

86
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,940
In a way where you've been able to iterate on this thing for four years

87
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,980
Expand out the range of what you're doing and what you're doing

88
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:26,140
We've been able to iterate on this thing for four years expand out the range of hardware and it's sort of all coming to it

89
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,660
At least to me it feels like it's all kind of coming together

90
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:36,740
When there are certain other market condition factors that are making people look for this type of hardware more than ever and if Dell

91
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:42,340
Was starting this endeavor today you would be too far behind the ball to be ready for the customers

92
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:49,740
They're looking for a replacement and it if this wasn't necessarily going to this there was no real clear indicators of these market conditions

93
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,340
ie

94
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,220
The total lackluster updates to Macbooks there was no real clear indication that this was gonna happen

95
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:01,140
Like these things seem like they were really nailing what developers wanted for a long time. Maybe I'll be a little expensive

96
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,220
So Dell really really got I mean in some ways it seems very lucky that they play it's right time

97
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,940
Yeah, and now now I wonder Barton

98
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:16,040
Are you experiencing a different set of customers than you originally anticipated is it pretty much exactly what you guys?

99
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,400
It thought it's sustainable. How can you give me a sense of what that looks like?

100
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:28,640
Well, I think what the the main thing here is is that we're pretty much a grassroots organization

101
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
So we don't have a huge marketing

102
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,520
budget

103
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,760
Basically, it's my blog and then doing things like this, which is one of the reasons why I'm so excited to be doing this

104
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
but lots of folks

105
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,560
Learn about this after we've been around for a few years

106
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,560
and so it's I would just say it's more of the types of customers that

107
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,200
We've been seeing from the beginning and I think one of the neat things here is we've actually built up some credibility

108
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,760
In the beginning, of course, you can imagine people thinking. Yeah, you guys are just

109
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,280
Dilettante you're gonna dabble in this and then you're gonna kill it after a generation or two

110
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,560
and then we've stuck with it and you know, they told two friends and they told two friends and so now we've

111
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,960
We've got a much bigger group that were that were

112
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,280
Targeting or who are aware of it. I should say. Yeah, I would say too that the hardware has

113
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,560
Has has proven itself West. How old is your Sputnik right there that you have?

114
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,660
Well, this has got to be one of the first or second. Yeah, and I have the first XPS 13 that had the

115
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
touchscreen for display

116
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,880
So these I mean the hardware itself has proven to be very sturdy and reliable

117
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,240
So that's had it's had a time to develop a track record. I I guess what are one of the things I kind of curious

118
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
I always like to try to

119
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,800
Try to ask the OEMs these these kinds of questions because I feel like a lot of our audience the first thing they want to

120
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:56,460
Do when they buy a machine is they want to format it install whatever and so I'm sure you must get constant requests for

121
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,520
XYZ distro from everything from things we've heard of two ones

122
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:06,520
We've never heard of how how important is it when developing a product like this to focus on a single distro?

123
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,520
Or could Dell foresee?

124
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,500
Multiple distros or maybe you personally foresee testing multiple distros because I to me my sense is

125
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,740
The scope of work is much smaller. If you just choose to optimize for Ubuntu

126
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:26,200
But I'm could you kind of give us a better understanding from somebody who's actually working in this field how critical that is or isn't

127
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:33,600
Sure, and I think that's the the beauty of open source in the community because as you're saying given our resources

128
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,200
We're gonna we're gonna focus on Ubuntu and and qualify on that

129
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:44,960
but there was an article that just came out about the review of the XPS 13 and ours technica and

130
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,320
He ran also fedora on and he also ran

131
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,640
Arch on it. So while we ourselves are only installing

132
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:59,640
Ubuntu as you say lots of folks first thing they're gonna do is is wipe it and put their distro of choice

133
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:05,200
So when we try and we work with we write drivers

134
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,240
The whole idea is then to push these upstream into the kernel so that people who who are not

135
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,880
Working with a boon to or that's not what their first choice is that they can they can benefit from that as well

136
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,760
So you've got this new Dell precision five or 5720 all-in-one

137
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,920
and one of the things I noticed about it is it's gonna come with a

138
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,680
4k optional display and

139
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,600
My XPS 13 has a 4k display. It also has things like Thunderbolt 3

140
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,440
Are you are you guys running up against any rough edges is okay

141
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,920
Can you could you kind of tell me a little bit the the process of going from?

142
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,300
Developing for focusing on laptops or I guess I shouldn't say developing but really getting getting the whole product ready with laptops is the main

143
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,800
focus and then transitioning over to desktop where their new challenges or is it pretty much business as usual and

144
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,980
Can you give us a little bit of like what it is like to work with with maybe canonical if there are challenges you run

145
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,360
into

146
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,720
Sure, so a bunch of questions there. I'll try and tackle them

147
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:13,040
I think in reality the the desktop one really isn't that much different than what we've been working on with the mobile workstations, right?

148
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,200
so the the precision line is the mobile workstation and then the okay the all the all-in-one is that is the desktop version of

149
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,480
It obviously but it really isn't that much different

150
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,680
And I then when you start talking about working with canonical the the other leg of the stool

151
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,320
It's it's Dell canonical and then it's whatever third party device driver. I'm sorry

152
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:43,160
Who's making things like touchpads, etc. And so the three have to work together then to actually get these things written

153
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,280
So it's it's rather than a what shall I say a duo?

154
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:54,260
It's a trio in in trying to get this stuff done. And that's that's where where it really separates

155
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,480
The the Ubuntu versions from the other ones obviously is you got to write the device drivers and actually make sure it works. So

156
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,640
that feels like that's always been sort of the

157
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,320
challenge to developing a Linux based product that

158
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:15,000
For the desktop or for the laptop is you're constantly you want to push the edge to meet market demands and you want to get

159
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,720
Like better trackpads in there or better Wi-Fi chips in there, etc, etc

160
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,840
And so there's always seems like there's always just writes out right outside our grasp

161
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:32,280
This totally open system that doesn't have to have a distro with this specific driver or this proprietary blob to work

162
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:37,140
It feels like we're always just outside of that because the market itself is always pushing so far forward

163
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,580
when when Dell works on these kinds of things how

164
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:46,180
How much of a priority is it to build a system one day where it doesn't matter if?

165
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,860
Which distro I load or which if I or I never will need to load a proprietary driver or a proprietary blob

166
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,940
How close do you think Dell could get a system to that ideal state that a lot of Linux users fantasize about?

167
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:06,220
And I think that's something we would we would push for but we don't have I would love to say we've got an army

168
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:11,500
Of folks working on that and we do have a fair amount of people working on Linux distros

169
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,460
So we will keep trying to get closer and closer to that

170
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,100
But it still would be a while. Do you feel Barton though?

171
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,060
Like the customers you're targeting right now

172
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,700
Is that a high concern for them or is if you what's your sense of that with the current customer base?

173
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:31,400
you know, I think is that there was and this is if I take a step back to my

174
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:38,720
Initial blog that that launched that announced this there was such a pent-up desire for anything like this

175
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,880
that

176
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,640
There was people were just doing what we're doing now

177
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:50,520
It's got people sort of over the moon not that it can't be done a lot better, but I think the existing

178
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,080
What was out there at that point was was lacking and I think that's where

179
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,040
People have just been so excited with having something that that just works

180
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,000
I think that was if you if you look at Mac they didn't set out to target developers

181
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,120
the reason why they developers picked it up is because

182
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,960
a it just work and be you had a Unix slash

183
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,520
Linux

184
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,560
underpinners

185
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:22,320
Those two together that's a for a lot of people even the the free software crowd. We're willing to

186
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,080
Put aside their

187
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,280
What shall I say some of their values and and go for mm-hmm?

188
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,560
I would say traditionally Apple to has been sort of

189
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,800
Developer hostile with the exception of unless you're developing for iOS or the Mac and you need access to Xcode

190
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:43,880
yeah, the whereas these Dell's is positioning these as tools for developers and to kind of play off what you just said Barton I

191
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
I'm wondering and I know

192
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,520
Wimpy is wondering

193
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Wimpy do you want to ask the question?

194
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,800
Because it's a it's a really plays off of Barton was just saying so my question is is if the poor

195
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,880
Reception of the recent MacBooks was considered when adding the high-end

196
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,600
Configuration options to the new lineup of right? I mean I'm seeing 32 gigs of RAM here

197
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,040
I'm seeing even Xeon processors available as an option. I mean that seems like a beast. I

198
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:17,320
Think in general when we talk about our client group is they're basically looking at what is what are the customers gonna want?

199
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,320
And what are they gonna want next?

200
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:26,040
and I've been at Dell for seven years now and it's just amazing how much better-looking and

201
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,560
All the awards were winning for our systems now that you know

202
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,200
We first started out when I looked at this. I said had the original idea put to me. We had a very

203
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,360
utilitarian

204
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,440
Laptop that did the job at a decent price, but it wasn't gonna win any beauty contest

205
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:50,880
And so now you've got things that we ourselves we're not looking to follow what what Apple's doing, but we're trying to figure out

206
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,360
how might we

207
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,080
We get ahead and and read what what is going to be next and needed in the market. I

208
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,000
think I think definitely for developers that are looking for a platform that

209
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:10,400
Matches what they run in production or doesn't necessarily get drug around by market strategy and and things like that

210
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
I think it's it's a very compelling option. I

211
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,280
I guess I I guess I would sort of I have just one last question and then I'll open up the mumble room if they

212
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,320
Have questions for you Barton, but I like to do this. It's it's the beginning of the new year

213
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,160
and I would be really curious to know if if

214
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,000
Barton could write one blog post and all of a sudden everything would change in open source that he was concerned about what would that one?

215
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
But if you could change one thing to improve

216
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,320
Maybe Linux on on the type of hardware that Dell ships or something in the open source community

217
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,880
Do you think that would help make it this more approachable?

218
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,600
I would love to know your thoughts on if by the end of 2017 something could change that would make Barton's life better

219
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,120
What would it be? What would that wave of the wand be? I?

220
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,320
Think what it would be and this is I started mentioning it before but it's it's the people beyond ourselves

221
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:07,160
And the canonical who are working to to support things like the touchpad drivers people who do that at different

222
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,960
Places that need to have drivers written if we can get more people to more seriously consider

223
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,120
Linux as as one of their their top targets and obviously with the volumes that Windows

224
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,400
Delivers, it's not going to be something that they're gonna put on exactly equal footing

225
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,320
But the more that we can get people to prioritize that and make it

226
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,240
Make a good show out of it. The the easier it is for for all of us

227
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,560
Barton, what do you suppose? What is your sense of?

228
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,480
How long this effort may continue? Do you have a sense that this has got good momentum?

229
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
You're talking about the Sputnik. Yes, sir. I

230
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,320
Think what I'm trying to do is is keep expanding it and not just on

231
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,360
the

232
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,520
client side as we call the the lap the

233
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,840
laptops and the desktops but tying it to other

234
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,840
things that Dell provides and when I say Dell now, I should switch Dell is what we call the the client

235
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,120
Side of the business Dell EMC is the broader company

236
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,960
Okay, and so and so that the more that we can tie it to things like

237
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,000
Cloud Foundry if you're aware, so one of the things I'm getting a system out

238
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,680
Tomorrow if I get if I can do it to someone who's going to see if they can get PCF dev

239
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
Which is the pivotal Cloud Foundry

240
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:33,840
Working natively on a Sputnik. So the more that we can get things tied to it then the the more that this

241
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,600
program

242
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,280
Continues to go on integrates with the rest of the strategy

243
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:47,040
Exactly. And so and I think in general I've just been extremely excited how we started with one config and now we've got

244
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,120
One config one system. We've now got multiple configs of the XPS 13. We've now got five

245
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,920
Systems in the precision side and because precision is configured to order

246
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,440
Unlimited permutations of of what's offered there. That's great

247
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,200
So so I'm very excited and I think the other thing too is we keep getting more visibility within the company

248
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,000
The fact that Linus Torvalds picked the XPS 13 as his laptop

249
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,400
Was actually something that went over pretty big within within that a lot of people were excited about

250
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:25,840
That even though we do a ton of stuff on Windows people understand the the value of somebody like Linus

251
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,080
and so

252
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,080
We're getting more

253
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,840
As I said within the company we're getting more visibility as well and that that helps quite a bit

254
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,920
That's great. And you know, I think if if the Sputnik project can stick around

255
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,280
You really are positioned to take advantage of some really great market conditions

256
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:52,080
They're gonna that they're not only just what was going on with Apple but also just as computing in general moves more towards

257
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,160
Cloud and the web blah blah blah and the general computing device you're using to access

258
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
It doesn't need to run a specific operating system

259
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,200
companies that sell

260
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,960
Specific expensive operating systems are going to be doing less less business and a company like Dell that could be positioned to already know

261
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,440
How to interact with the upstream community the individual vendors?

262
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,760
That's a that's a huge advantage potentially Wimpy's reading my mind though

263
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,960
And I wanted to give him a chance to jump in about the XPS. Go ahead movie

264
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:24,440
So Barton, do you know if there are any plans to introduce an XPS 15 developer edition at some point?

265
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,120
Yes, I just got that on Twitter before I got on the

266
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:35,200
On the call we get that every so often. So mr. Shuttleworth himself does the uses the XPS. He does

267
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,640
15 that being said at this point. We don't have any plans

268
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,400
But if you get enough positive customer input we do

269
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,920
so for example, the whole way we got into the precision line was because

270
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:57,000
Customers were saying we need a bigger beefier system. Hmm. We launched on the XPS 13 and we just all of a sudden

271
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,800
People kept saying hey, we need some more XPS. We need a better XPS system

272
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,680
All of a sudden people kept saying hey, we need something bigger

273
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,400
We need something more powerful and then just a quick trip through memory let memory Lane

274
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,920
That's where Jared Dominguez who's on the call and part of the Sputnik team went and just got it running

275
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:25,000
Ubuntu running on the the M 3800 which is the precision system at the time and he put those that information out for folks

276
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,120
And then that got so much positive feedback that the year after that

277
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,080
We made it a real boy and we had that was once again started with the M

278
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,400
3800 that year then we went to the four and now we're doing the four plus

279
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
plus the five so

280
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
All that being said to the XPS

281
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,700
15 is very similar to the

282
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,300
fifth not 57 to in the 55 20

283
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,760
So that's for for the right now. That's where we would we would steer people

284
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:02,440
but as they say just like many times we get enough positive customer feedback and we actually

285
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,300
Just like the program itself it becomes a we can productize it

286
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,780
It's hardening to hear that there's that kind of internal flexibility in the you know

287
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,080
There's you've built that trust up over the years to do that

288
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:20,520
so we will have a link to Barton's blog if you're curious Barton George dot IO is where you go if you want to visit directly and

289
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,860
We have the post linked where he talks about all the new hardware because for me

290
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:30,240
I just got really excited about the new all-in-one and the new laptops, but the names matter

291
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,160
So if you want to make sure you get the names, right like a precision versus things that are not laptops

292
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,440
Check all of that out in Barton's blog where he's outlined at Barton

293
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,720
Is there anything else you want to add before I would let you run?

294
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,540
We're gonna update it soon but Dell comm

295
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:52,520
Sputnik or Dell comm slash developers will have the the list of all the systems. That's work in progress

296
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,760
so if you go today, you'll you'll see the new the

297
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,560
3520 which is available now, but that that'll have more information

298
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:06,100
we'll have links as as we go forward, but you know other than that, I'd just like to say thank you so much and

299
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,760
The great thing about this and it can only happen with something like this

300
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:18,000
Is that the whole fact is that this is open source and this is community driven and that's been since day one

301
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,080
What has made this which a lot of people at at Dell looked at skeptically?

302
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,240
Viable that people actually said no this we really do want this

303
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,880
And we want to pay for a nice system as opposed to what Dell had before which is let's put a free

304
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,480
Operating system like canonical on a low-end system and we get a low-end price point

305
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:46,760
This is the idea here was let's put it on a really good system. So people have a quality system

306
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:52,000
So anyway, I love that once again. Thanks so much. Thank you Barton. Thank you for making it work

307
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,280
We appreciate it that keep up the great work

308
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:00,640
we keep advocating Linux there at Dell and feel free to drop us a line whenever something interesting is going on because

309
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,400
2017 I it's funny Barton yesterday on the Linux action show I had I

310
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,880
This is crazy day

311
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,440
I had no idea you and I'd be having this conversation today or I guess it was two days ago on the Linux action show

312
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:18,080
I predicted the 2017 would be the year that Dell really steps up with Linux and I start taking them seriously and I think two

313
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,680
Days into 2017 s prediction. It's coming true already. I'm gonna be watching this closely for the rest of the year. So

314
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,380
Thanks for once again proving me right Barton

315
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:36,280
Yeah, thanks for all the great hard work and we will we'll definitely be following with interest and like I said chat room if you

316
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:42,080
Guys want to see that post you can find the link in the show notes to Barton's blog now before we go

317
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,360
Any further and get into the rest of the updates of the week?

318
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:50,000
I want to thank ting for sponsoring this episode of the unplugged program best URL in the business

319
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,360
Linux dot ting dot-com

320
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:58,760
Linux dot ting dot-com is where you go to save $25 off your first ting device or if you bring a device and you just

321
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,560
Might be able to do that because they got CDMA and the GSM's

322
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,240
What does the GSM stand for global?

323
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Come on chat room global

324
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,280
Systems muckery as I think yeah. Yeah, it's a technical term

325
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,640
Yeah, I don't even give me started on CDMA, but they got both of them cuz ting be crazy like that

326
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:24,880
Here's what I love. There's no contract nor the termination fee and you only pay for what you use you only pay for what you use

327
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,600
How brilliant is that? That's impossible. It's how it works. It's six dollars for the line and then you pay for what you use

328
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,800
Crazy ting is crazy. I know and I love it because I get to choose whichever network works better

329
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,560
I only pay for what I use I use Wi-Fi like a boost and then to top it all off you get to speak to

330
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,320
a real human when you need customer service

331
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:48,120
And they have a fantastic dashboard to choose from you can bring your own cheapo phone or they'll sell you one with no

332
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,120
Contract no get in the way of updates. No termination fees

333
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,120
Man, everybody ought to do it like this and they just might one day if you vote with your wallet at Linux dot ting

334
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,680
dot-com

335
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:07,020
And I've had a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program Linux dot ting dot-com also. Hey the rest of the industry

336
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,080
Go learn how to do a dashboard. It's only gonna cost you six dollars a month

337
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,920
Go create a ting account and just learn how to make a good dashboard. It's

338
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:23,640
2017 already linux dot ting dot-com big thanks to ting for sponsoring the unplugged shenanigans all right, Wes, so I

339
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,240
Don't know what to make of this. I really don't know what to make of this

340
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,240
I

341
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,440
Feel like the Raspberry Pi folks some of them want us to run pixel on all of the things

342
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,320
Oh, yeah, and this is a step too far. I can't take it

343
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,840
I can't take it at all, but they have made the pixel linux desktop environment available for x86 PCs

344
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,200
You can download an ISO with it all ready to go

345
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,920
That's a by the way pixel is their backronym for PI improved xwindows environment lightweight. Yeah, just kind of shake me

346
00:27:53,920 --> 00:28:01,560
I'm just confused. It's a jacked up version of LXD. I mean a modified version of LXDE for the x11 desktop environment

347
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:06,340
That's the new cool desktop environment x11 desktop environment. That's that that's what says it right there

348
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,880
New hot says it right there the x11 a desktop environment

349
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,280
And you know that's the good hotness because it's not transparency Chris is that they're not talking about a display server

350
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,240
No, no, they're talking about an excellent anyways moving on it was originally released in September for the Raspberry Pi

351
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,120
We covered it back then but now it's been packaged up for your x86 PC. They say pixel

352
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:33,520
This is a ebbin says pixel is our best guess our best guess as to what the majority of Linux users are looking for in a

353
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,480
Desktop environment put simply it's the GNU slash Linux. We would want to use they say

354
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:50,920
It's clean has a modern user interface curated suite of productivity software and programming tools and by curated. They made 1.3 gigabytes

355
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,840
I wonder what their definition of curated mean

356
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,960
yeah, so it's Debbie and Jesse with a pixel on top and you can burn it to a DVD they say if you like or

357
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,600
Write it to a to a thumb drive

358
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,980
Optional persistence West is this a shot at

359
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:14,700
The standard Linux distribution desktop environments like I I feel like this

360
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,540
I I feel like I I would say this if wimpy wasn't here

361
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,740
So I'm just gonna say it anyways

362
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:25,140
I feel like this is a shot at a buntum ate because a buntum ate is kicking a ton of ass on the Raspberry Pis

363
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:31,380
It makes it makes the Raspberry Pi a completely usable real computer with a no compromises traditional desktop environment

364
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:36,020
And I think the Raspberry Pi folks are seeing that going. Oh crap. There's this other distribution

365
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,340
That's getting more dominance on our own platform than our own software

366
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:47,060
Why are they successful? Oh, well, it must be because you can run on x86 PCs ergo. We will make we'll reverse it

367
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:55,380
We'll flip the script and we'll release our desktop environment in distro for x86 and that will stop the problem

368
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,380
We'll stop the bleeding

369
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,540
What do you think?

370
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,740
You know, I was really confused when we saw this we put it in the show notes. I

371
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,860
I guess to me it feels like they're going there

372
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:12,020
It's like a like an attempted dominance play where I don't know cuz it's kind of it feels weird from our perspective

373
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:17,260
Like I'm not interested in this, you know, we have a wonderful community here of like longtime Linux users some new people

374
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,020
But anyway people who are of experience you can shop around I can't imagine installing this

375
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,980
But I wonder if it's something that with the fact that it comes with a pi store icon on the desktop

376
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,420
I wonder if that has anything to do it might but I could see that like, you know

377
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,060
You're new to the pie

378
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,700
Maybe you get into Linux using high software if this is the default if this is what you're comfortable with it could be

379
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,860
You know an easy way to extend it like okay now we can run it on my desktop

380
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:41,100
I guess I mean at least is Debian wimpy. I have to ask you what you think of this

381
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,500
Well, I'll tell you what I've got two I've got two things to say about this the first is

382
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,240
You know my thoughts about this pixel initiative and if you want them

383
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,900
reinforcing then

384
00:30:53,900 --> 00:31:00,120
Listen to episode 1 of late-night Linux where Aiki Doherty is now a

385
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:06,340
Presenter on a podcast you just see now you're totally spoiling my end of show plug. Oh, I'm

386
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,620
Do it now now, I don't know what I'm gonna do it the end of the show, but it's fine

387
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:15,460
Aiki launched a new show. I think it's brilliant called late-night Linux is episode 1

388
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,260
We'll have it linked in the show notes. You guys got to go check it out. It sounds like

389
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,220
Something irrelevant or interest is on there continue

390
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,940
Okay

391
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:29,440
So you want to listen to Aiki's little spiel about the Raspberry Pi pixel?

392
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:37,020
Desktop environment his thoughts and my thoughts are completely aligned now to your point about

393
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,980
Did the Raspberry Pi Foundation?

394
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:46,540
Respond to Ubuntu Marte on the Raspberry Pi. I believe it's the insurgency of Ubuntu

395
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,220
Yeah, whatever you want to call it if if the only thing

396
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:57,880
Ubuntu Marte achieved is to make a better default operating system for the Raspberry Pi

397
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,600
Then that's a fine legacy as far as I'm concerned

398
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,140
Wow, I couldn't I couldn't have written a better response if I had an hour to come up with it with you

399
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,600
That is some smooth as butter response right there. I love it

400
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,800
Well, I suppose that's one brilliant and wonderful way that leaves my heart feeling warm to look at it

401
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,800
So I choose to move on and not ask further questions. Do you have a thought? Okay, so

402
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,820
Let's go from that heartwarming story to kill disk ransomware that's targeting Linux machines demands

403
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:34,120
250,000 u.s. Greenbacks ones converted from Bitcoin depending on the rate and then doesn't decrypt your files

404
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,980
after you give it the

405
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,520
$250,000 greenbacks

406
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,640
That is the lowest of the low crazy

407
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:47,240
You're undermining the whole ransomware industry when you do this because people are gonna stop paying if this becomes a trend a whole trust

408
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,560
Thing here. I mean no one liked it

409
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:54,200
But yeah, at least you can get your phone that you're really gonna you're gonna undermine the industry when you do this ransomware authors

410
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,360
I'm telling you I don't really know how big of a deal is I'm having this really weird

411
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,240
I mean, it's not unusual

412
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,360
but it's extremely strong with this one a lot of hype logs a

413
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,560
Lot of like end of the world that the sky is falling

414
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:13,800
All your files will be destroyed and and no good really technical analysis of what this thing is

415
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,580
but it it I don't really cuz you mean like I would love to know a

416
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,280
Great example of how it's getting on people's machines how they're executing it

417
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,960
Has anybody the mumble room come across the story that covers it on that sense?

418
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:34,720
Yeah, I'm taking that science to me know that I haven't seen it either and I've been I've been looking people are too scared killed

419
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,560
There's been anything though two hundred twenty two bitcoins really I know that's pretty

420
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,840
Yeah, that that is a lot, but doesn't like some businesses have been paying them. I mean yeah, I yeah

421
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,600
Yeah, that's how we found out well

422
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,680
No, we found out because someone reversed

423
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,920
He said did a random key he said did the research on this thing?

424
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,880
So he said went in and did the research on it on December 6th

425
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,640
And they say there's even variants out in the wild too

426
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,520
They say things like we are so sorry, but the encryption of your data has been successfully completed

427
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
so you could lose your data or

428
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,040
Pay two hundred and twenty two BTC like people even know what BTC is

429
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,520
Like you imagine if you got that and you don't have any you don't you're just starting from like wow

430
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,120
That's rough, then they put the address on there. You know what we could do if anybody in the chat room wants to screenshot this

431
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:27,520
Screenshot that and then go look up and see if any bitcoins were sent to that address. That's publicly available

432
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,960
Yeah, so that's how William. That's how we could find out if anybody paid it

433
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,440
Cuz are you true, so I'll leave that up there on the screen for a moment while we do this

434
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,800
So I guess there's only one address oh

435
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,600
Right because there's variants too. Yeah, I don't know necessarily

436
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,480
That's the only address, but you could at least look at that one and see if anyone paid to that one

437
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,040
I don't know if it changes not getting as much attention

438
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,240
But there's also a version for Windows called win 32 kill disk, so it's not just a platform everyone

439
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah, all your favorite side at least they're sorry about it. Yeah

440
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,840
They're so sorry actually we are so sorry, but the encryption

441
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,780
I like the cadence of it, too

442
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:10,800
We are so sorry comma, but the encryption of your data has been successfully completed comma

443
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,280
So you can lose your data or pay, and there's no commas or periods right there

444
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,320
It's all just like mixed messaging of sorry, but successful also

445
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,860
It's also nice that they have a contact email on maybe if we email them we can ask if anyone's paid

446
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,720
It's interesting look at this and then in grub on the lid on the on Linux

447
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:41,760
They rewrite grub so that the menu entries in grub are the error message so frustrating look at that. That's it so right there

448
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,640
It's in grub

449
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,320
We are so sorry

450
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,360
But the encryption of your data has been successfully completed so you can lose your data or pay and then it goes on

451
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,800
In and each line of the sentence is a grub menu entry for boot

452
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,740
That is that's a whole kind of awful

453
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,280
That's a kind of they have the they do have a technical analysis on the ESET blog

454
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:08,000
And it doesn't really go into though how they how they launch it though. What's kind of areas

455
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,300
Is that the one they do they reference the the telebot?

456
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
Infection that they reference in the

457
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,880
description of this one

458
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,480
There's an infection vector listed there

459
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,600
But the one that they're now talking about getting a lot of press for knowing no vector

460
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:28,640
Yeah, I mean I would assume under Linux you are somehow getting this on the machine now

461
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,200
Maybe it's getting put on there remotely through another vulnerability

462
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,000
But it would seem like more like a phishing attempt or something downloading it and then getting the user to execute it

463
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,520
Which for better or for worse is not as easy it is on Windows right? No, it's not

464
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:47,320
I mean, where are you because you would also likely have to market as executable because what what are you downloading from your browser?

465
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:53,840
Doesn't automatically mark things as executable. So are you getting people to plus X these things as well? How is this working exactly idea?

466
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840
Yeah, you've got it's got to be

467
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,600
Distribute what I find interesting is they're seeding the key based on the time of the system and that's it

468
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,640
And so I wonder if based on the modification type of the file you couldn't like and guess what the key might be

469
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,360
Oh, yeah, so Rekai looked it up on blockchain. They've received one transaction

470
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:17,800
It looks like a test transaction because it's just zero point zero zero zero one BTC

471
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,560
Well, let's hope so they don't get any either

472
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,800
They haven't gotten any money that or they have lots of addresses or something

473
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,520
But yeah, so no one's paid that one at least which is the one that's all over news articles

474
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,000
So don't get tricked audience. Do not send your BTC. It's funny somebody sent it on December 30th

475
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I

476
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,760
Might be might just be I wonder if you could trace this back if it was someone trolling them

477
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,240
What would be really funny is if you could trace that transaction back and then figure out who it is based on blockchain

478
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,640
So I don't really think anybody actually has to worry about this

479
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,520
But what really struck me was the amount of panic is at a whole new level

480
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:00,960
All kinds of all kinds of blogs about it. Like there was I don't know three or four

481
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,800
different articles by this weekend and now there's like a dozen articles written by today and none of them have any real substance and I

482
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,160
Don't know if anyone that's actually been affected in the wild

483
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,920
I mean it sounds the article implies like somebody was infected in the wild and their screenshots of it

484
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,220
So it's likely been run in testing, but I don't know. I don't know right? It's like there's no

485
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,800
Qualifications or evidence is to like is this any you know dramatically more popular than any of the other

486
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,440
I wonder if they found the Linux variant by first getting the Windows variant

487
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,080
Like I wonder if there's some connection that makes it easy to find the Linux one

488
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,360
After having the Windows one as a sample

489
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,840
Do you guys know I used to work in an antivirus company and they had a yeah

490
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,220
They had a whole isolated research division where they were trying to get infections and stuff all the time

491
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,040
Yeah, it was pretty cool. It was a real scam of an antivirus company, but

492
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,920
It was a bad one

493
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,920
It was I didn't really know at the time because like what did I know about Windows antivirus back then?

494
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,720
but I was in the IT department they ran all Linux and they ran asterix for their phone and

495
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,120
It's where I learned to use bacula. Oh, that's awesome

496
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,560
And I there's a wire I also learned a very I had a very quick crash course in network

497
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:09,880
Segmentation because they had like this they had this cool setup like they were off in this

498
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,240
Second half of the building where they didn't have their overhead lights on and they had lamps at their deaths

499
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,280
And and and they have their own network with its own internet connection. It was like this

500
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,160
It was like this truly cool and squadrant. Yeah. Yeah, very much. Oh, yeah

501
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,640
So that was my first experience with that kind of thing and it's that's how they do it right they get systems

502
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:35,120
I have lots of VMs and they would get infections and then they would go track that back. They would reverse the path and

503
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,540
Like William says a lot of times they'd start with a with a Windows one and they'd find that there's a Linux variant just by

504
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,400
Beginning the research of it not because it's necessarily getting actively excellent

505
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,240
It's very it feels like a million years ago

506
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:56,600
And I would have killed for a resource like Linux Academy back then Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

507
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:01,280
Go there to support the show and sign up for a seven-day free trial. That's madness

508
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,880
You could really just dive in and you really get it really get a sense of it engage with some of the live instructors

509
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,720
Enjoy the community stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members

510
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:17,960
Have yourselves a little hands-on scenario based lab or an in-depth video or maybe use the core scheduler to match your busy schedule

511
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,560
We get lots of emails about certs

512
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,120
Lots of emails and they have courses created specifically to prepare you for exams

513
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:30,240
And they have this public profile section that I think is ideal for those of us that need to either

514
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,600
Prove to an employer that you're using your education time

515
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:41,080
Like I I for a long time worked at companies that gave me a budget every year to for education and this boom again

516
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,880
Perfect for that and you can use the public profiles to demonstrate the work

517
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,760
You've done also great to help clients understand what you're capable of or just to prove to yourself

518
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,520
I also appreciate the fact that they understand you don't always have hours and hours and hours to commit to this stuff

519
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,640
They give you the study tools you can download and take with you. That's awesome

520
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,720
They have mobile apps that you can take advantage of when you're on the go

521
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:04,000
They have nuggets with a little tiny bits of sparkly wisdom. Just a deep dive into a single topic

522
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,200
They have the learning paths and course schedulers to help work around your busy schedule

523
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,520
No cards to help you study up really quick. It is incredible

524
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,720
Incredible and to top it all off. They have that instructor mentoring and they're constantly adding new content

525
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,580
I just got an email from Anthony yesterday about a whole new slew of stuff going into Linux Academy

526
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,580
Check it out at Linux Academy comm

527
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:33,060
Slash unplugged Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and a big. Thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring this unplugged program

528
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,720
Talking about hardware. I mean Barton's really got me thinking about it. All right, and

529
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,720
I

530
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,720
Have this I have this sort of

531
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,920
kind of kind of

532
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,800
Casual eye on where Intel is going with these really small

533
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,040
x86 PCs and they've tried they keep trying to dip their toe in here

534
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,680
They've totally missed the boat on the mobile stuff and they keep trying to dip their toe in here kind of compete with the Raspberry

535
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:06,040
Pi and I think they might have something kind of interesting now this came up at CES and it's Intel's compute card

536
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:11,520
It's a PC that can fit in your wallet. It's intended to be a more versatile replacement for the compute stick

537
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,520
That hasn't really gotten a lot of traction

538
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,240
And I was I was kind of interested in the compute stick

539
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,400
But it really was a bear to put Linux on in fact

540
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:25,200
I think we bought one and tried and couldn't even get I can't remember but we don't have the specifics on the specs yet

541
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:31,000
But Intel reps say that it will have the performance of high-end fanless laptops like some MacBooks

542
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,640
The processors have a TDP of up to six watts, which could fit in these things, which is pretty nice

543
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:41,600
That's like a low-powered atom or even the M and Y series core i5 and i7 CPUs

544
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,960
So that's actually an i5 in my pocket. Yeah, they're gonna enough this

545
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,240
I'm not so sure of I guess this would have to take off but because it's Intel

546
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,640
They could probably just rev it into a chipset

547
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:58,160
Intel says that the card uses a variant of the USB C port called

548
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,080
USB C plus extension

549
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:07,920
Oh, it allows you to connect the system right in so you connect this to like say another PC

550
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,840
It allows you to connect right into the PCIe bus as well as the HDMI and DisplayPort video outputs

551
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,120
so they feel like it could be like a like a way to like really juice it up and

552
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:27,900
They estimate the compute stick will drop off their roadmap in 2018. Okay, and this will be what replaces it

553
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:32,120
It's an x86 based PC. It'll be available to run something called Windows

554
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,480
That sounds like something you put in your house and then also Linux

555
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:42,280
Basically any operating system you kind of put on the low-end PC in mid 2017 the Intel compute stick

556
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:47,220
It's interesting that they felt limited by the the connections available on the compute stick

557
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:51,940
I think that was one of their motivations to to move to this weird new USB. There's a new USB C era

558
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:59,020
I wonder if that hopefully it seems like they'll need that. They're a USB C plus extension to be compatible with other things

559
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,700
Because I could see it working if like, you know

560
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:05,260
The dong we really do start living in the dongle universe where there's dongles and docks and USB C things everywhere

561
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:05,740
Then yeah, sure

562
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:08,860
If you've got this thing in your wallet, then you show up and you plug in your one cord

563
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,460
Maybe this is the conversions device

564
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,260
Yeah

565
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:17,100
Anybody in the mummer room have thoughts on this particular type of form factor before we jump from this one's really cool as like a

566
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,980
smart card type thing

567
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:23,180
You could be your smart card was like your identity type information and like core information

568
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:27,740
You want to carry around your smart card could be your entire PC on that. Yeah. Well, not so much

569
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:32,540
But why not? It's not powerful enough for me. Yeah, I mean, I think some people could live with this

570
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,500
Yeah, I think that's a very small market right now. I think this is up to get more powerful

571
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:42,260
Yeah before most people can live with it. I agree. Yeah, it's still worse performing than even like the ARM Chromebooks

572
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:47,000
yeah, and I so I I I think I I think I'm like

573
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,180
I think I need at least a four core I

574
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,940
seven

575
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,860
As a minimum like 50 watt TDP process

576
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,880
Like a 50 watt TDP GPU, yeah, I look at those two core ones

577
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:06,500
I'm like, you know, you know Chris you could probably slum it and get away with an i5. Yeah, I maybe maybe I don't know

578
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:12,300
I don't know. I'm back to that precision line then one of the big trends out of CES this year is these

579
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,100
huge

580
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:21,380
Laptops, have you seen some of these? Yeah. Yeah, they're meant to be fancy crazy. Yeah with like dual power supplies and

581
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:26,980
22 inch curved screens in some cases and they're just that seems like a lot to look around

582
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:33,860
I feel like almost like 1820 pounds, which is ridiculous. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is there a market like a briefcase?

583
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:43,100
Well, is this is this a huge is this a huge response to is this like a big backlash to?

584
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,100
the MacBook thing I

585
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:51,580
Know that you know, this was sort of in the making for years. That's what I feel like too. Yeah push this in any way

586
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:54,540
But they're not making these things as a folly, right?

587
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:59,900
They must they must believe that there is a customer base out there for these things. I'm thinking maybe

588
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:07,500
You know on set editing machines for you know, big productions and what have you could have er I know wimpy

589
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,940
You probably would doubt this

590
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:13,500
It's not gonna not gonna be for VR is it? I mean you blundering around

591
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,700
blinkered

592
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,700
wearing your nose bag

593
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,060
possibly running into

594
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:26,860
It's just not gonna happen but now I'm thinking I'm thinking, you know high-end editing machines

595
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,780
3d video creation tools that sort of stuff

596
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:34,940
I think with gaming GPUs being possible to integrate into laptops now

597
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:42,000
It's becoming more prevalent like your 1080s and your 1070s the desktop variants can be directly integrated into laptops and even water cooled

598
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,300
And that's yeah, I know so it's a crazy

599
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:43,500
Yeah

600
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:43,620
well

601
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:49,180
The 1080 series with the CPU slowing down and being fast enough and the GPUs sort of catching up in the mobile segment

602
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:54,940
Gamers are really interested in these devices and Asus makes one where you can dock it and it's water-cooled

603
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:59,360
So like the GPUs and everything are hooked up to water blocks and there are two outlets on the back

604
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:03,220
That hook up into a dock to give you more cooling when you're docked at your desk. Yeah

605
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:09,780
That is are you are you saying that there's a potential market there for pro gamers for these? Absolutely. Yeah

606
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,900
Wow, well, there you go. See at least that's a merging as a market

607
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,980
It may be that of course becoming a thing, of course

608
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:20,420
You're gonna be taking your rig anyway, and you know that that you know, and I've recently

609
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,060
I've recently been working with

610
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,900
4k footage that is it's it's compressed but it's a hundred megabits and

611
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,620
It makes my machine

612
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:31,740
chug

613
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,540
Just crying and as I'm you know

614
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:40,100
My my SSD gets like it's like eight nine hundred megabytes a second read and it's still when I'm skimming in the editor

615
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,940
100 megs a second. It can't keep up when I'm really jumping around

616
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,900
And then of course rendering that and all of that. It's becoming a it's big

617
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,980
I'm pushing that I'm pushing the limits of it and I could

618
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:57,020
Honestly, I don't need portability in my main editing machine other than I need to be able to edit

619
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:03,060
somewhere wherever I'm at right and I will you know, I can set up and I can plug in and I don't need hours of

620
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:08,300
Battery life, but I need unlimited disk and CPU and it doesn't make sense to have like a big desktop in the rig

621
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,860
Or anything that you could just have this and then still take it to this video

622
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:15,740
The other problem is when you're dealing with files like this is a day's worth of shooting now is 70 80 gigs

623
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:19,820
You probably need your fastest and then like a second disk at least with I'm every night

624
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:22,740
I have to offload to the NAS to make room for the next day's editing

625
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:28,180
Oh Chris a minute. Take a look at those laptops with the curved screens. Come on

626
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:32,480
I think that would be kind of cool Chris. Take a look at the link I son in the where's

627
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:39,020
Gx800 or the YouTube video. That's some that I gotta go go linked. Oh, jeez. I know yeah

628
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:43,120
That's what I was thinking about from Linus. Yeah, I don't I think they probably have a content

629
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,020
I did so yeah, they've actually had a similar model out in the past

630
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,140
There was a previous iteration that is very similar

631
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:57,060
I hope they don't content ID this but I think he actually says right here has to put it down because it's too heavy to

632
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,060
Hold yeah, it's super heavy

633
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,060
My arms tired yeah, it's

634
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:10,060
It has been funny watching that too bad. They all run Windows. Yeah, Bart needs to go talk to all those people

635
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:14,060
Tell them what's up?

636
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:19,700
To get one of these and then integrate Linux into it. Yeah, yeah, maybe I wonder if they would do

637
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,600
I wonder if they'd be up for something like I think these are from a clevo line like I think they could actually

638
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:30,940
Take these and fix them up these feel like this is a pretty bit like this feels like unless I'm misunderstanding

639
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:37,740
I understand professional gamers is a huge growing area which kind of blows my mind in its own right, but could they I just seems nuts

640
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,380
Okay, I guess just here's what I'm trying to go with this

641
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:47,340
Could there really be enough of a market that this many vendors are building machines this extreme and that there's like a gamble

642
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:53,300
I really don't think so. I think what Dale needs to make is really the thing that Razer is doing with a three monitor laptop

643
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:59,060
Days where you'd like to slide out monitors. Yeah, that's what I thought of when I saw that

644
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:04,140
Yep, although I don't think razor has any intention of actually ever shipping that at the moment

645
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:09,860
Oh, I have to get him bad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there's nine thousand dollars for some of those machines

646
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:12,460
Uni you want to jump in go ahead

647
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:21,100
Uni go on once are you muted uni? Sorry? Sorry? Oh, there you go. No, you're it's okay. Go ahead. Go ahead

648
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:26,220
All right, so I got Mario grip over on telegram here

649
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:30,560
He just wanted to let everyone know that no Ubuntu touch is not dead

650
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,280
Oh, yeah, the guy that runs you be ports. Yeah, we covered that on last

651
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,240
I don't know if anybody in here hint hint has any comments on it

652
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,220
But yeah, essentially it sounds like it's hiatus why we transition from or they

653
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:46,520
Transition from click packages to snap packages and then integrate it with the rest of the overall strategy fair

654
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,100
Fair I think I've said that before right? Yeah, it just makes sense to and it feels like the right time to do it

655
00:50:53,100 --> 00:51:00,300
Yes, I was I almost made a prediction that canonical will drop mirror in

656
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,700
2017 but then I just decide now they're too far. They're too far

657
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:09,420
But wouldn't that wouldn't that make everybody's mouth drop if they just said I you know what?

658
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,400
We think we can get what we need to weigh land for us. Yeah, that would be a great news week for us

659
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,820
Yeah, I almost made that prediction but yeah

660
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:24,860
I know that a lot of people are reacting about Ubuntu phone a lot of what I'm seeing is hope saw that common

661
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:31,380
you know real armchair kind of stuff, but I think it's extremely practical at this stage and

662
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:37,940
It it would be it would be awkward to have this division with click packages and snap packages

663
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,500
Especially with so much momentum in the company behind snap packages

664
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:45,180
And if you wanted to make the case for like Linux users to move over

665
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,700
Here's the whole little bit different of an ecosystem that you have to learn

666
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,940
Sorry, it's not just a bunch of on your phone that you're used to. Yeah, it's

667
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:54,540
It is it's too bad that it hasn't gotten more traction

668
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:59,940
I would have liked to have seen a few solid US options. I I

669
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:06,740
really, you know, I've I've I've exhausted myself talking about about about mobile at this point, but I think

670
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:12,380
long-term it just seems to make the most sense anyways, like if if you're not afraid to be a little embarrassed in the short term and

671
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,220
you have the

672
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:18,220
Fortitude to stick with it over the long term seems like the better route to go. Yeah, just my

673
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:23,940
Estimation. All right, Wes. Well, I want to talk about a couple of things

674
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,660
I said I was gonna I said I said I would confirm two predictions

675
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:30,180
I've only confirmed one prediction this one more to go. I got one more to I know I know

676
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:34,740
So before we get into that, I want to thank digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program

677
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:39,620
Did you know that digital ocean is a thing and it's a thing that will change your life

678
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,500
That's true. Yeah unplugged

679
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:47,860
Do unplug it a $10 credit it go create the account then you apply it do unplugged

680
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:54,140
It is it is really something I guess I probably if you've heard these spots and you've never gone and actually pulled the trigger

681
00:52:54,140 --> 00:53:00,220
I don't really need to tell you something you haven't heard before you probably are aware that it's a simple easy way to get started

682
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:06,740
To create a Linux rig up in the cloud and their data centers all over the world all SSD based super fast great UI

683
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:09,540
super nice API

684
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:15,020
Solid set of documentation some of the best on the web really straightforward pricing and our release available

685
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:19,820
That's oh and basically any distro you'd ever want to choose from and if they don't have the one you'd want

686
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,820
You know, which one I'm talking about

687
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,540
There's a little birdie that tells me with that HTML 5 console you can make it happen

688
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:27,700
I'm not saying that and I'm definitely not putting that in the spot

689
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:31,920
So cut all that out, but I'm just saying there's a thing you can do. They have an HTML 5 console

690
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,140
It's a powerful thing from post to boot check it out at digital ocean comm use the promo code deal and plug now

691
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:43,100
You know where you know, you know how you can use digital ocean if there is any tasks you can do

692
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:47,220
That doesn't require a GUI if there's anything you can do on the command line

693
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,460
You could use a digital ocean droplet for it pretty much

694
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,140
You got something you need to download in the background. You want to host some torrents?

695
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,380
I mean I'm talking simple stuff for average everyday users

696
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,700
Digital ocean works for you

697
00:53:55,700 --> 00:54:01,060
If you want to build the back end infrastructure for your business or in our case for your live streaming infrastructure to send it off

698
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:06,380
To scale engine and YouTube and you stream and bippity bops and records here's and maybe a Twitter account

699
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,260
Maybe a twitch channel one day you gotta use, you know

700
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:14,280
I could assure I guess I could have a big old rack that I'm running hardware out of all the time like an animal

701
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:20,680
Or I take advantage of their entire Linux infrastructure using KVM for the virtualizer SSDs for the storage

702
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:26,940
Oh, and did I mention 40 gigabit e connections right into them hyper visors? They're doing it, right? I

703
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:33,260
Mean, yeah, I guess I could spend all of my time building that and get like one per not even 1% of what they got

704
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:37,540
I mean, it's really come on. It's a as the Borg would say it is a futile maneuver

705
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:42,220
Go over to digital ocean comm use the promo code do unplugged. It's one word

706
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:46,140
it's lowercase smack your leg when you're saying it apply it to your account and

707
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:50,740
Thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program. I

708
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,100
Am not proclaiming that the Mac is dead

709
00:54:54,100 --> 00:55:00,540
I'm not proclaiming that Linux is going to become the champion of 2017. I am simply saying

710
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:05,060
That a lot of long time Mac users developers

711
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:08,460
technical workers are abandoning the platform and

712
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:13,860
We have yet another blog this week. And these are one of many examples

713
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:17,580
we have one last week to the title is from OS 10 to Ubuntu and

714
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:21,500
It's a fascinating read. It's good. If you're looking to switch yourself

715
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,500
I won't go through all of it

716
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:28,100
But I did highlight a couple of the interesting bits and then I want to talk a little bit more about some of the data

717
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:32,380
We have so he says I was a Linux user ten years ago, but moved to a Mac one

718
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:36,820
Mainly because I was tired of maintaining an often broken system looking at X org

719
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:38,660
Yeah, man

720
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:46,780
And all Apple had a quite appealing offer at the time a well-maintained Unix platform with beautiful hardware good UX and access to editor

721
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,700
apps I like like Photoshop and

722
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,420
office

723
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:54,820
The trigger was pulled when Apple though for him to switch when Apple announced the 2015 MacBook line with strange

724
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:58,940
Connectivity decisions like having unique ports for everything and using strange dongles

725
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:01,900
You know if they're if their top-notch hardware started to turn weird

726
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,780
It was probably time to look elsewhere and now I've seen the latest MacBook Pro line escape key was removed

727
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,660
I'm kind of comforted in my decision

728
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:14,060
He's also recently joined Mozilla at the storage team and saw lots of colleagues happily using Linux

729
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:21,380
They weren't struggling with anything in particular oddly enough. It seemed like they were capable working efficiently both at work and for their personal stuff

730
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:26,420
so in this case our author buys a Lenovo x1 carbon and

731
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:33,940
Started transitioning over to Linux chose Ubuntu right away because previously that's what the developer used and stuck with the unity desktop

732
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,140
Everything worked right away

733
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:42,540
Nothing really needed to be messed with including Bluetooth and external display unity is going fine

734
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:47,540
The last batch of OS 10 apps are that he really liked are not available on Linux

735
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,820
But so far most equivalents have been found

736
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:54,620
For the most part the web is your app store. That was an interesting observation

737
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:59,260
I mean, I think we've talked about that before but he's he's definitely right that ten years ago today

738
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:02,020
There's a lot more that you can do online. You just don't have to worry about on Linux

739
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:02,440
Yeah

740
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:07,420
And this is there's still some web apps than error that don't you know don't live up to the app and up to snuff and so

741
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:11,580
There's some type of specific tasks and native apps that are still more efficient or better integrated than what the web has

742
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,860
finds a unity launcher to be sufficient and

743
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:21,100
Has looked at to Albert and synapse file managers talk, you know talks about all that

744
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:25,600
but I guess I'll end it with the conclusion because you can read the rest talks in here about using

745
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:32,680
Dark table and and all of that gaming music. It's a really fantastic video editing password management

746
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,260
It's a fantastic

747
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:37,420
Post but so is Linux ready for the desktop for me?

748
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:42,100
The answer is yes, the author concludes and will be sticking with Linux

749
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,060
And Nicola's I believe is how you say his first name

750
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:52,180
This is like I guess we could I am I won't I won't keep doing this

751
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:56,140
I won't keep reading all of these blog posts every year or I mean every week as these come out

752
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:00,620
But I wanted to read it this week because it goes in combination with another report that's come out

753
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:07,100
Greg over at computer world is reporting on this that according to net applications who constantly reports on this stuff all the time

754
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,740
Apple's mac OS is

755
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:16,360
Is beginning to decline from seven percent actually actually peaked at nine point six percent

756
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,120
But now it's down to six point one percent

757
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:24,580
Yeah, so I guess it was down seven percent from a year ago. That's actually a decent drop-off

758
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,120
Now you're wondering about Linux Linux user share is at two point two percent

759
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,740
It peaked at two point three percent in November in those new MacBooks came out

760
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:39,380
And a Linux first cracked the two percent barrier back in June of 2016 and now we're sitting at two point two percent

761
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:43,460
So nice little growth curve for little there Linux. So um, I

762
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:48,940
Present you a case West in my am I looking for evidence of

763
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:54,660
upset in the Mac community and then coming to Linux or do you think we are witnessing the

764
00:58:55,300 --> 00:59:02,260
Slow new trickle of Mac exodus users coming over Linux. Am I right or am I looking for trouble?

765
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:02,980
No, I think you're right

766
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:08,540
I mean if anything I think you've been a little bit cautious in that there are always those people who are doing that switch

767
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:11,460
There's always you know, and there's a lot of for a lot of people who it's kind of easy to be like well

768
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:18,440
Yeah, it works for me. I think what's unique now is that we're seeing people who had a lot of them were previously unit Linux users

769
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,300
They've dabbled in it

770
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:23,540
Some of them have tried over the years to switch or you know have one Linux system and then have to use

771
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:28,400
Their OS X so I think what the difference is we're seeing people who you know, this is like their main workstation

772
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,060
This is their main work laptop that kind of thing

773
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:35,920
And now the kind of folks Barton is targeting exactly and it does feel like there's like a a zeitgeist changed where now

774
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,560
Linux is a real option for in their minds again

775
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:47,420
Yeah, and I think it there's there's also sort of this sort of belay setting in over the situation with some of the previous vendors

776
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:53,540
Mm-hmm. I think it's a whole interesting storm. All right, that's it. I'm done. I'm just saying I think this is a good trend

777
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:58,060
For Linux in general. I think maybe I've beaten this horse now. We'll check back in in some months. Yeah

778
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:04,500
Yeah, simmer and exactly exactly because for all I know in a couple of weeks. They'll all realize they hate Linux

779
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:04,700
Yeah

780
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,100
They all can start writing post Linux is the worst

781
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:12,780
How I tried to switch to Linux and it blew up in my face and I came rounding back to the Mac like that could be

782
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,900
The post and they all end up buying Mac Pro trash cans

783
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:23,140
We'll really eat our words. Yeah, that's right. Ww you want to jump in go ahead. Yeah, I'm thinking that maybe

784
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:30,020
Professionals and the people who really use those big machines that are tired and they're they're moving away from it

785
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,220
They're moving away from it because as work

786
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,260
workloads get you know bigger like

787
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:41,660
Video professionals and photography professionals are gonna be dealing with higher and higher images

788
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:47,640
They need something that's cutting edge that can do the work that they need to do it

789
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:52,180
No work on two-year three-year old hardware. That's last generation

790
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:53,460
and

791
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:58,740
That could be pushing them to move to you know, besides openness of Linux, which is yeah much better

792
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:04,220
I I so I think too when it comes to business, you know, they specifically like predictability to a degree as well

793
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:06,700
I mean, there's there's there's obviously constraints on that

794
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:12,860
but you know as a business you you you sometimes build a workflow around certain hardware features and

795
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:20,180
For a lot of professionals the loss of the SD card reader, even though the thing doesn't doesn't it's not required

796
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:24,780
It's not necessitated by thickness requirements because the reader is tiny and then it's as thin as an SD card

797
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:31,700
it is but that's that one thing is a major blow to the digital video workflow because

798
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:41,180
essentially a lot of like the the Canon cameras and even Sony cameras and Nikon cameras have standardized on SD, right so when you're shooting it with

799
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:46,140
Photography or shooting video on these cameras and then you go to sit down and import it

800
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:50,580
You always have SD cards you need to work with and you don't want one more dongle that you're dragging around

801
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:54,060
You already have the giant camera bag and the laptop this seems like a small example

802
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:58,980
but this on this unknown quantity with when it comes to Apple hardware where

803
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:06,260
One one line of one line has this feature and then the next iteration on it all of a sudden removes it and now that's

804
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:11,540
in a dongle it's this unpredictability of when it's gonna get updated and how much that's gonna cost and

805
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:16,700
There's also just the fact that businesses are looking at these things and going well, what am I getting from my purchase here?

806
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,860
This is an $8,000 computer when I when I build it. What am I getting out of this?

807
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:21,860
I think all of those things add up

808
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:29,060
All right, anything else from the mumble room before we officially consider this closed top unless something interesting develops

809
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:32,740
We're gonna consider this topic closed for the unplugged program going once

810
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:41,020
Going twice and poppy. I secretly use Arch Linux. Thank you on a macbook though, so it's fine. Yeah, ha ha ha ha

811
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:45,020
He doesn't actually, he secretly uses Ubuntu Mate, but we'll just call it that

812
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:48,060
Yeah, it's not so secret anymore

813
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:54,220
Alright, that'll bring us to the end of this week's unplugged. We're gonna get out here a little early this week

814
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:59,020
because once this show ends we redress the set and

815
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:04,500
And the next episode of tech snaps getting recorded check out Wes on the new tech snap what?

816
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:07,540
Yeah, also recording on Tuesdays after unplugged at least for now

817
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:13,700
So you can show up listen to the unplugged program live hang out stick around and catch a live tech snap

818
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:15,820
How about that for a double ender?

819
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,740
