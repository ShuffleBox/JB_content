00:00.000 --> 00:06.800
I want you guys to know I am exercising an intense amount of personal control today because

00:06.800 --> 00:09.160
I'm still freaking out on the inside.

00:09.160 --> 00:13.560
Yesterday I learned that the city of Miami has created their own cryptocurrency called

00:13.560 --> 00:18.760
Miami coin and you can mine Miami coin.

00:18.760 --> 00:24.260
So I had to put out an extra about this because I just I feel like I got to have an outlet

00:24.260 --> 00:25.260
for this.

00:25.260 --> 00:29.240
Otherwise I'm going to end up packing our Linux show full of full of cryptocurrency

00:29.240 --> 00:30.240
chat.

00:30.240 --> 00:33.680
But after I discovered there's a Miami coin, I just about lost it.

00:33.680 --> 00:35.440
So I had I had an idea.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.560
This is this is my solution.

00:37.560 --> 00:43.920
Kernel helped me create a JB crypto enthusiast discussion channel in the matrix.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.200
And what we'll do is that'll be our crypto bullden.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.400
We'll keep all the enthusiasm and all the chatter there.

00:49.400 --> 00:54.240
So for everybody else out there who couldn't care less, who doesn't want to hear about

00:54.240 --> 00:56.180
it, they don't have to be inundated with it.

00:56.180 --> 00:57.320
We'll just keep it all over there.

00:57.320 --> 01:00.280
So that'll be linked in the notes and we'll have it in our matrix room.

01:00.280 --> 01:12.840
Yeah, but what we all really want to know is how much Miami coin do you have now?

01:12.840 --> 01:16.800
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:16.800 --> 01:17.800
My name is Chris.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.800
My name is Wes.

01:18.800 --> 01:19.800
And my name is Brent.

01:19.800 --> 01:20.800
Hello, gentlemen.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.240
I'm glad you brought your JB coin with you today.

01:23.240 --> 01:24.840
Well, you required it for entry.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.080
I mean, we had to.

01:26.080 --> 01:27.640
And you must hold.

01:27.640 --> 01:28.640
You must hold.

01:28.640 --> 01:33.200
Well, coming up on the show today, our inbox was packed with some rather thought provoking

01:33.200 --> 01:37.240
emails, including some that push back on a few things we brought up on the show.

01:37.240 --> 01:41.880
So we'll get to a big batch of those and tell you about some of our upcoming plans we have.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.920
They're absolutely ridiculous and could potentially blow up on our face.

01:44.920 --> 01:52.040
And then because no one should ever try this, I attempt to use CentOS Stream 9 as a desktop.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.040
So that way you don't have to.

01:54.040 --> 01:57.960
Then we'll round out the show with some great pics and more.

01:57.960 --> 02:02.200
So before I get any further, before we get into all of that, we got to say time appropriate

02:02.200 --> 02:03.720
greetings to our virtual lug.

02:03.720 --> 02:04.720
Hello, Mumble Room.

02:04.720 --> 02:05.720
Hello, Chris.

02:05.720 --> 02:06.720
Hello, Wes.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.720
Hello, Brent.

02:07.720 --> 02:08.720
Namaskaram.

02:08.720 --> 02:09.720
Hello.

02:09.720 --> 02:15.560
You know, I mean, it's 16 people isn't bad, but that's not a high number by a long stretch.

02:15.560 --> 02:19.640
And this is one of our last Tuesdays that we're going to be live.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.640
Aww.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.640
I know.

02:21.640 --> 02:22.640
I know.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.640
Change is hard.

02:23.640 --> 02:24.640
It is.

02:24.640 --> 02:28.560
New year, new server, and a new LUP time.

02:28.560 --> 02:31.480
It's all starting January 2nd.

02:31.480 --> 02:35.580
We will still have a Tuesday transitionary period where we'll still have some live streams

02:35.580 --> 02:36.840
for a little bit.

02:36.840 --> 02:41.700
And there'll be some virtual lug action and some Mumble Room action going on on Tuesdays.

02:41.700 --> 02:42.700
So that will still be there.

02:42.700 --> 02:46.240
There'll still be something for people that have a Tuesday availability.

02:46.240 --> 02:49.160
But the show will be moving to Sunday, January 2nd.

02:49.160 --> 02:53.960
And if everything goes as planned, that day we'll have like a potluck brunch.

02:53.960 --> 02:55.360
That's right.

02:55.360 --> 02:57.220
And a new server christening party.

02:57.220 --> 03:01.880
And then later in the day, in the afternoon, we'll have our first live LUP.

03:01.880 --> 03:06.500
You'll be welcome to stay here at the studio and listen in the living room, assuming things

03:06.500 --> 03:11.180
are safe and the news hasn't taken a turn for the worse in that regard.

03:11.180 --> 03:14.500
And then shortly after that, we'll also have a new Linux show launching on the network

03:14.500 --> 03:15.500
as well.

03:15.500 --> 03:18.040
So it's a great time to be sure you're signed up to the all shows feed because then you

03:18.040 --> 03:22.040
get the extra I just released yesterday and you also get the new show when that launches.

03:22.040 --> 03:24.040
We have a link for that at Jupiter broadcasting dot com.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.640
But there's a lot happening.

03:25.640 --> 03:29.560
If you just listen to the feed and you don't tune into the live show, nothing's going to

03:29.560 --> 03:31.200
really change much for you.

03:31.200 --> 03:36.040
It's still going to have the same great Joe production and we're probably just going to

03:36.040 --> 03:37.520
be out a little bit earlier.

03:37.520 --> 03:42.460
So perhaps where you listen to land before, you'll now be listening to LUP if that time

03:42.460 --> 03:46.080
slot will just be kind of swapped and we'll have more information about that soon.

03:46.080 --> 03:50.680
But it's all coming up and we'd love to have you here for one of our last live Tuesdays,

03:50.680 --> 03:53.480
which we do have a few more as we round out the year.

03:53.480 --> 03:58.880
And of course, coming up very soon, it's the taxis and our predictions episode.

03:58.880 --> 04:02.840
So those are some really fun episodes to be here live.

04:02.840 --> 04:07.720
But let's talk about stream nine that came out since we gathered together.

04:07.720 --> 04:12.320
And this is the centos I have truly, truly been excited about.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.640
Number one reason it's based on Fedora 34.

04:14.640 --> 04:15.840
That's a great release of Fedora.

04:15.840 --> 04:20.560
They have been for a while, but 34 brought GNOME 40.

04:20.560 --> 04:26.280
Additionally, this is really the centos that was born since the stream announcement that

04:26.280 --> 04:32.760
was built from the beginning as a distribution that's going to be a stream distribution.

04:32.760 --> 04:41.740
And I thought to myself, this might be a great way to essentially have an LTS Fedora desktop.

04:41.740 --> 04:48.200
Something that has GNOME 40.4.0, so it's not the latest GNOME, but it's still what some

04:48.200 --> 04:49.200
distros are shipping.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.040
There's still some current distros that are shipping that, right?

04:51.040 --> 04:52.640
So it's not that old.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.560
It's got Firefox 91.3 ESR.

04:55.560 --> 04:59.240
So this thing's really focused at being kind of a long term supported thing.

04:59.240 --> 05:03.200
So how is this going to work as a desktop?

05:03.200 --> 05:06.340
And Carl, thank you very much, Carl, he kind of prepared me.

05:06.340 --> 05:10.360
We had a chat, we recorded a great chat with Carl for Linux Action News to talk about the

05:10.360 --> 05:12.840
release to get the actual real details.

05:12.840 --> 05:18.440
But Carl warned me, like, there's a few things in the kernel that are missing between Fedora

05:18.440 --> 05:20.200
and centos.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.100
And ButterFest was one of those.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.880
So that was good to know.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.680
So I didn't go in with the expectation to be able to format my drives with ButterFest

05:27.680 --> 05:28.680
and stuff like that.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.360
I went in with expectations low.

05:30.360 --> 05:35.140
But you know, during the installation, you get a real nice minimal experience.

05:35.140 --> 05:36.920
It's a lean desktop.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.000
It's just got a black background.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.760
There's not a GNOME extension loaded.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.840
There's no GNOME extensions loaded by default.

05:43.840 --> 05:47.600
And you can kind of then work it up and build it up from there.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.280
It comes with Flatpak preloaded this time.

05:50.280 --> 05:53.760
So that means getting FlatHub up and going is super simple.

05:53.760 --> 05:57.000
And then I had access to every single application on FlatHub.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.360
But it isn't a polished desktop experience.

05:59.360 --> 06:03.960
Like I had this weird problem where GNOME just sort of thought Firefox was perpetually

06:03.960 --> 06:04.960
launching.

06:04.960 --> 06:05.960
So I'd launch it.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.880
And then after I closed it, GNOME thought it was still launching.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.360
So you couldn't use the desktop launcher to reopen it.

06:10.360 --> 06:14.480
I had to go to the command line and type Firefox and launch it that way.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.840
And the only way to fix that would be rebooting that I saw or maybe log out.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.000
There's just those little things.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.760
This UI is designed to give you a graphical UI on top of your server.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.280
It's not designed to be a desktop UI.

06:27.280 --> 06:31.480
But I could actually see over time kind of making it work.

06:31.480 --> 06:34.960
And Carl, I wonder if one of those things that would be helpful would be Apple in this

06:34.960 --> 06:35.960
regard.

06:35.960 --> 06:41.080
We had an ask before the show started to have you explain what Apple is.

06:41.080 --> 06:44.280
And Apple 9, too, I suppose, might as well.

06:44.280 --> 06:45.280
Because it's a brand new release.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.100
And that's an area you work at now at Red Hat.

06:47.100 --> 06:51.960
So could you kind of give us the elevator pitch on Apple and why people love it?

06:51.960 --> 06:52.960
Yeah.

06:52.960 --> 06:55.280
So Apple stands for Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux.

06:55.280 --> 06:59.200
It is a subproject of the Fedora project.

06:59.200 --> 07:03.820
And you mentioned that CentOS Stream 9 is based on Fedora 34.

07:03.820 --> 07:09.640
And while it's based on it, it is only a subset of packages that get ported and brought over

07:09.640 --> 07:13.440
from that Fedora release, a small subset of packages.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.720
There's a lot of packages in Fedora.

07:15.720 --> 07:20.820
And it would be impossible for Red Hat to support all of those for all of RHEL's lifecycle.

07:20.820 --> 07:26.200
So that's why they whittle that down to just the things that they feel strongly about supporting

07:26.200 --> 07:29.540
and providing to Red Hat customers.

07:29.540 --> 07:34.760
Every package in Fedora that doesn't get brought into RHEL then becomes eligible to be part

07:34.760 --> 07:36.540
of the Apple repository.

07:36.540 --> 07:41.440
And the same Fedora maintainer can just create another branch and build it and have a RHEL-compatible

07:41.440 --> 07:44.720
package that they just maintain in line with all their other Fedora packages.

07:44.720 --> 07:49.320
So you could see how someone who maybe wants something that's not in that curated set of

07:49.320 --> 07:52.240
packages would find Apple to be kind of a bit of a lifesaver.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.280
So that's great.

07:53.280 --> 07:57.060
Something tells me, like, if we were going to try to use Stream 9 as a studio desktop,

07:57.060 --> 07:59.720
we'd definitely be pulling in some of those Apple packages.

07:59.720 --> 08:00.720
Yes, definitely.

08:00.720 --> 08:04.700
Apple's probably the most popular third-party repository for RHEL.

08:04.700 --> 08:05.880
It's not something new with Stream.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.400
We've been doing it for a long time.

08:07.400 --> 08:11.040
I think Apple 4 was the very first one for RHEL 4.

08:11.040 --> 08:15.600
And it works for RHEL, it works for CentOS and CentOS Stream.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.920
It works for other RHEL derivatives.

08:17.920 --> 08:22.780
And it's quite popular and pretty well respected in the community.

08:22.780 --> 08:28.200
Most people just kind of assume when they're using RHEL significantly, or anything related

08:28.200 --> 08:31.080
to RHEL, that they just accept that there's going to be a few things they have to get

08:31.080 --> 08:32.080
from there.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.720
And those packages are completely unsupported by Red Hat.

08:34.720 --> 08:39.640
But now Red Hat is realizing that even though we're not going to support those packages,

08:39.640 --> 08:44.000
it's in our interest to make sure that Apple is well resourced and stood up and ready for

08:44.000 --> 08:48.880
the next RHEL major version, which is why now, in a big change, we actually have Apple

08:48.880 --> 08:55.200
9 available now, five, six months, depending on exactly when it launches before RHEL 9.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.200
Right.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.200
That is really great to see.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.120
And it shows there's been real progress.

08:59.120 --> 09:02.640
It's a huge change that's only possible because of the CentOS Stream changes with it leading

09:02.640 --> 09:03.640
RHEL slightly.

09:03.640 --> 09:08.680
Yeah, it's been neat to see a little bit of knock-on effects building on top of each other

09:08.680 --> 09:09.680
with that change.

09:09.680 --> 09:10.920
It's been a lot of that.

09:10.920 --> 09:14.360
Carl, you joined us on Linux Action News 2.18.

09:14.360 --> 09:18.520
And we went into more detail on Apple, but also the CentOS Stream 9 release.

09:18.520 --> 09:19.620
And it was a great chat.

09:19.620 --> 09:23.660
So be sure to, after you're done listening to this episode, make sure you've listened

09:23.660 --> 09:28.240
to LinuxActionNews.com 2.18 because there's even more stuff in there.

09:28.240 --> 09:31.160
And Carl joined us on a Sunday to help us go through all that.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.200
So double thanks for that.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.520
Of course.

09:34.520 --> 09:42.480
Now Wes has been awful quiet behind the scenes because he is working on a big upgrade for

09:42.480 --> 09:45.160
our members right now.

09:45.160 --> 09:48.480
And I'm not ready yet to talk about it because we have more show content we want to get

09:48.480 --> 09:49.480
to first.

09:49.480 --> 09:53.320
But Wes, like how many minutes out would you say from completion is?

09:53.320 --> 09:54.320
Is everything done?

09:54.320 --> 09:55.320
Is it run now?

09:55.320 --> 10:00.200
Well, it's running currently, but there's at least one of the steps that takes a bit

10:00.200 --> 10:05.400
of time because there's some downloading and some uploading and waiting on some backends.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.800
You know, computer things.

10:06.800 --> 10:07.800
All right.

10:07.800 --> 10:08.800
Well, then we'll kill a little bit of time.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.320
We still have a ton of stuff to get to.

10:10.320 --> 10:14.320
We have a packed show.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.000
lino.com slash unplugged.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.400
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

10:20.400 --> 10:21.400
show.

10:21.400 --> 10:25.720
Linode is simple, affordable and accessible Linux cloud solutions and services.

10:25.720 --> 10:31.600
Easily deploy cloud compute, storage and networking in seconds with a full featured API, a command

10:31.600 --> 10:35.400
line and a brilliant cloud manager that has a user friendly interface.

10:35.400 --> 10:40.360
And with 11 data centers around the world, Jupiter Broadcasting has been able to locate

10:40.360 --> 10:44.960
systems close to our audience or close to our staff depending on the function of the

10:44.960 --> 10:45.960
system.

10:45.960 --> 10:50.600
And because Linode is their own ISP, the connections between those data centers and the internet,

10:50.600 --> 10:52.440
well, they're as good as it gets.

10:52.440 --> 10:58.080
And perhaps the very, very best part about Linode, they lead the industry in price to

10:58.080 --> 10:59.620
performance.

10:59.620 --> 11:05.600
They have some of the fastest systems in the cloud and they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the

11:05.600 --> 11:08.440
lock you in hyperscalers.

11:08.440 --> 11:12.860
And you always are covered by Linode's outstanding customer support.

11:12.860 --> 11:18.080
No handoffs, 24-7, 365 support you can actually talk to.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.800
Go see why we build every test system on Linode.

11:20.800 --> 11:24.900
We research, we develop, and then we deploy to production on Linode.

11:24.900 --> 11:26.320
We do it all.

11:26.320 --> 11:29.160
Go see why we love it and get $100 to play with it.

11:29.160 --> 11:35.080
Go learn, go try something, go experience Linode, linode.com slash unplugged.

11:35.080 --> 11:39.440
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

11:39.440 --> 11:45.560
show, linode.com slash unplugged.

11:45.560 --> 11:50.720
So we have a lot of email and one came in that I can kind of connect with actually.

11:50.720 --> 11:54.580
I felt like this was a pretty reasonable email and it's one that's been crossing my mind

11:54.580 --> 11:56.020
too.

11:56.020 --> 11:59.720
So I'll start and it came from Jay and he says, guys, I'm a long time listener and I

11:59.720 --> 12:02.200
appreciate the hard work that all of you put into the shows each week.

12:02.200 --> 12:06.840
I was listening to LUP 434 today and that prompted me to write it.

12:06.840 --> 12:10.600
I've been a Linux fan for nearly 13 years, but over the past several months I found myself

12:10.600 --> 12:15.160
growing increasingly frustrated by the entire Linux ecosystem.

12:15.160 --> 12:18.800
My frustration really began when the University of Minnesota's hypocrite commits issue came

12:18.800 --> 12:22.280
up and then continued with release of GNOME 40.

12:22.280 --> 12:25.840
And it kind of accumulated today when I was listening to you guys discuss the state of

12:25.840 --> 12:28.560
Flatpak and software delivery in general.

12:28.560 --> 12:33.480
What I've come to realize is that Linux might not be all that great.

12:33.480 --> 12:34.480
Here's why.

12:34.480 --> 12:40.440
The University of M scandal showed me that Linux as an OS has too many chefs in the kitchen.

12:40.440 --> 12:43.320
As a software engineer myself, I had a different view than most did of that incident.

12:43.320 --> 12:49.200
In my opinion, if someone exposes a flaw in my code, that's on me.

12:49.200 --> 12:54.080
I don't get indignant or angry and blame that person for pointing out my mistake.

12:54.080 --> 12:57.320
I suck it up and I fix it.

12:57.320 --> 13:00.920
To see the kernel development team being so indignant and hostile about the hypocrite

13:00.920 --> 13:03.720
commits was really disappointing.

13:03.720 --> 13:07.760
I was expecting that the OS was being developed by a group of professional developers at best

13:07.760 --> 13:11.340
and a group of adults at least.

13:11.340 --> 13:15.840
They got embarrassed publicly by the scandal, yes, and they responded like petulant children

13:15.840 --> 13:19.440
instead of just taking their lumps and correcting the course.

13:19.440 --> 13:22.960
The simple fact that the commits even made it past QA is embarrassing.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.360
The BSDs don't have this problem.

13:24.360 --> 13:28.960
They have far fewer bugs because they actually seem to care about code review and QA.

13:28.960 --> 13:29.960
Now he wraps it up.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.760
It just keeps going.

13:31.760 --> 13:37.200
In a nutshell, I felt like it was disappointing to see Fedora ship GNOME 40, but Ubuntu and

13:37.200 --> 13:38.200
Pop!

13:38.200 --> 13:41.160
OS hold it back for no other reason than they apparently had more extra work to do to implement

13:41.160 --> 13:42.160
it.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.880
Ubuntu's offering was mediocre.

13:44.880 --> 13:48.840
Pop shipped Cosmic, which I know I'm in the minority here, he says, but I thought it was

13:48.840 --> 13:51.520
a dreadful experience.

13:51.520 --> 13:54.720
The UI was just a dreadful experience.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.560
That brought me to my overreaching point.

13:57.560 --> 14:01.140
Linux will never be successful as a desktop OS precisely because of the thing that makes

14:01.140 --> 14:04.240
it appealing, the choice it gives users.

14:04.240 --> 14:08.320
Don't get me wrong, I love the freedom to choose, but Linux has reached a saturation

14:08.320 --> 14:09.320
point in my opinion.

14:09.320 --> 14:13.200
And he talks about all the different solutions we have for the same problem, X or Wayland

14:13.200 --> 14:17.440
or GNOME or Plasma, XFC, Mate, Cosmic.

14:17.440 --> 14:21.880
He says there's serious Unity problems across different teams, no standards, no unified

14:21.880 --> 14:25.680
design language to fall back on, no totally agreed upon standards, which is true in some

14:25.680 --> 14:31.000
regards and not in others, but he wraps it up as he says, final bit here, I fear that

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
without the Unity and a bit of consolidation of development efforts, Linux will never be

14:35.000 --> 14:40.120
anything more than what it is, a semi-polished, cobbled together mess that people enjoy tinkering

14:40.120 --> 14:41.500
with.

14:41.500 --> 14:48.200
That is, Jay, a pretty brutal criticism, and I think it's a kind of understandable position

14:48.200 --> 14:50.240
after the last year of news.

14:50.240 --> 14:53.820
I think it's okay to say too that, you know, like if that, if what the Linux desktop is

14:53.820 --> 14:57.280
providing you isn't working, like there's a lot more to the Linux experience than just

14:57.280 --> 14:58.280
that.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.160
I don't think we need to force it, you know?

15:00.160 --> 15:03.720
I mean, like I can see some of these flaws, but they don't bother me.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.640
I don't feel like it gets in my way.

15:05.640 --> 15:09.280
I find both GNOME and Plasma to be perfectly functional workstation desktops, whether it's

15:09.280 --> 15:13.800
my personal stuff or development, but I also see how other people have different expectations.

15:13.800 --> 15:17.320
So I think to some extent we need to get comfortable with that too, and we need to talk about what

15:17.320 --> 15:18.320
our goal is.

15:18.320 --> 15:22.160
Is our goal to take over what remains of the computer desktop space, or is our goal to

15:22.160 --> 15:24.760
make a functional tool for computer enthusiasts?

15:24.760 --> 15:29.760
Yeah, Wes, I think it's interesting you use the choice of words, computer enthusiast,

15:29.760 --> 15:37.080
because he mentions that maybe this will never be appealing to the broad computing market,

15:37.080 --> 15:39.520
and maybe that's totally fine.

15:39.520 --> 15:44.320
I don't know if it's realistic to think that we could, you know, be the biggest desktop

15:44.320 --> 15:51.400
around, but we sure are quite good at being interesting to the enthusiast.

15:51.400 --> 15:57.760
And he specifically says the thing that makes it appealing is the choice that it gives users,

15:57.760 --> 16:04.160
but that's also what will make it not a successful desktop OS.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.160
So I'm curious.

16:05.160 --> 16:09.840
You got to compromise a little bit, it sounds like, to sometimes be ahead of the curve and

16:09.840 --> 16:12.120
try some new things that may or may not succeed.

16:12.120 --> 16:18.480
Wes, something you said that struck me here is there's so much more to Linux than the

16:18.480 --> 16:24.760
desktop, and a lot of people in our audience love Linux, think it's great, but they've

16:24.760 --> 16:29.280
decided to use Windows or Mac OS as their main desktop, and then they have a machine

16:29.280 --> 16:34.360
that they SSH into, and they spend so much time in that environment, it's where they

16:34.360 --> 16:41.640
spend the bulk of their passion project time is in a Linux environment, but they're connected

16:41.640 --> 16:45.320
from a Windows 10 or Mac box or something.

16:45.320 --> 16:50.320
And I think it's not a bad idea from time to time to take a break from the desktop and

16:50.320 --> 16:55.160
focus on the areas where Linux really kicks ass, and to figure out where that is, just

16:55.160 --> 16:56.160
follow the money.

16:56.160 --> 17:01.840
Linux is going to kick ass on the server because that's where a ton of money is, and the desktop

17:01.840 --> 17:07.760
is a passion project for a lot of people from a very skilled few who are generous enough

17:07.760 --> 17:13.040
with their time to make something as great as it is, but they don't have the benefit

17:13.040 --> 17:19.600
of Samsung, Intel, Western Digital and Google all contributing code to the same subsystem

17:19.600 --> 17:21.640
or something like that, right?

17:21.640 --> 17:25.760
Where the RISC-V people do have that kind of advantage, and it's because that's where

17:25.760 --> 17:31.240
the money is, and so I think there's absolutely nothing wrong with taking a bit of a break

17:31.240 --> 17:33.120
from time to time.

17:33.120 --> 17:37.040
Also, I consider myself a former Linux hype man.

17:37.040 --> 17:41.200
I still see a lot of people out there that do this, a lot of my friends, I used to be

17:41.200 --> 17:45.360
one of them, I mean that's what the Linux Action Show was, it was a lot of excitement

17:45.360 --> 17:46.360
and hype.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.280
I mean, remember that Switch to Linux challenge, anyone?

17:48.280 --> 17:50.800
Yeah, I was just gonna say that.

17:50.800 --> 17:57.660
Our mindset was everyone should be running Linux, and now my mindset is there's probably

17:57.660 --> 18:04.920
a distribution for everyone, but Linux itself is a power tool, and I know this is such an

18:04.920 --> 18:10.440
old tired analogy, but it is, really it holds up, otherwise it would probably have faded

18:10.440 --> 18:16.880
by now, but you don't recommend that people commute to work in trucks or run their errands

18:16.880 --> 18:18.400
in a truck.

18:18.400 --> 18:23.800
A truck is something that has capacity for work, it's something you use as a work vehicle,

18:23.800 --> 18:27.340
and it's not a vehicle for every day, every one.

18:27.340 --> 18:32.160
It is appropriate for some, and we don't sit here and try to sell trucks to everybody all

18:32.160 --> 18:37.560
day long, but when you just come in with this hype that Linux is for everyone and that you

18:37.560 --> 18:41.980
should be able to do a one-to-one swap from your Windows machine to Linux, we're selling

18:41.980 --> 18:46.840
a false hope, and every now and then, we manage to sell that false hope to somebody who has

18:46.840 --> 18:52.920
like a large YouTube channel, and then they go on there, and they call dolphin shit, and

18:52.920 --> 18:59.080
they crap on free software efforts, because they're looking at it with a completely distorted

18:59.080 --> 19:03.600
perspective, and maybe one day we could say, yes, it's a one-for-one swap for everybody,

19:03.600 --> 19:04.720
but that's not it.

19:04.720 --> 19:08.800
So take a break, focus on the stuff that does kick ass, and then what you'll find when you

19:08.800 --> 19:13.440
come back in, you'll be really impressed and enthusiastic about the improvements in the

19:13.440 --> 19:18.160
Linux desktop, because it always does keep improving, and so when you take a bit of a

19:18.160 --> 19:23.680
break, even a few months, and come back, it's like, wow, look what they've done, and it's

19:23.680 --> 19:24.680
fun again.

19:24.680 --> 19:27.280
Hey, I like that approach, you know, focusing on the fun parts.

19:27.280 --> 19:28.600
You don't have to force it.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.280
If it's not working, there's no shame in that.

19:30.280 --> 19:35.080
I think maybe sometimes we attach a little bit too much hype and focus and just, I mean,

19:35.080 --> 19:38.660
I think we all would love to live in a world where the first-class premium desktop experience

19:38.660 --> 19:43.480
was also free software, but if that's not the case, you know, we can still hope for

19:43.480 --> 19:48.040
better things, we can still admire the progress we get, and then also just acknowledge the

19:48.040 --> 19:49.940
state of where things are and be okay with that.

19:49.940 --> 19:55.960
I don't think it's inappropriate at all to think of Linux as a raw material from which

19:55.960 --> 20:01.520
a lot of us are building our own desktop product from, and some of these desktop environments

20:01.520 --> 20:05.880
and some of these distro makers have made it so simple for us to build our own product

20:05.880 --> 20:08.780
that we don't even think of it as that anymore.

20:08.780 --> 20:15.160
But if you look at where Linux has been massively successful amongst average users, it's when

20:15.160 --> 20:21.080
a company or a group has come along and taken the stack, they've made selective choices

20:21.080 --> 20:26.400
about what's in that stack, they've curated it, and they've created a product out of it.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.880
Look at Chrome OS, look at Android, and now look at the Steam Deck.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.120
The Steam Deck is a curated product.

20:32.120 --> 20:37.560
Again, they took special effort into making a curated thing from these raw materials,

20:37.560 --> 20:40.520
and that's what we're really doing with our own desktops, we just don't even really realize

20:40.520 --> 20:41.520
it.

20:41.520 --> 20:47.000
And the end users that have come from something like Mac OS or Windows or Chrome OS, they're

20:47.000 --> 20:48.880
not thinking about it in those terms.

20:48.880 --> 20:53.880
That gets me thinking about, we've had our friend Pope on here once in a while, and he

20:53.880 --> 21:00.600
mentioned that there's a unspeakable number of sort of corporate users who are using Ubuntu,

21:00.600 --> 21:06.360
for instance, and I feel like there are a lot of people who are using it, and we maybe

21:06.360 --> 21:08.080
don't have the visibility there.

21:08.080 --> 21:12.680
But one question I guess I can throw to each of you and maybe even to the Mumble Room would

21:12.680 --> 21:18.880
be, Chris, like, do you still get that same giddiness when you use desktop Linux these

21:18.880 --> 21:22.280
days and what keeps you using it on a daily basis?

21:22.280 --> 21:23.280
Hmm.

21:23.280 --> 21:26.560
Yeah, I mean, definitely around new releases, for sure.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.400
I always am after that.

21:28.400 --> 21:31.520
I'm always on the betas before they're released and all that kind of stuff.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.920
So that always manages to still get me.

21:33.920 --> 21:39.340
I was thinking, you know, on my machines that I use, that I tinker with more, I'm bouncing

21:39.340 --> 21:43.560
around all the time, distros, desktops, I still do it all the time.

21:43.560 --> 21:47.200
I think it's just one of the things that appeals to Linux about me.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.320
But on the studio machines, we're going now on what, three?

21:50.320 --> 21:53.840
Yeah, we're kind of on the other side of the spectrum, deploying LTSs.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.040
2018, right?

21:55.040 --> 22:01.120
These machines are running Ubuntu 2018 version, whatever the hell that was, 1804.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.160
And we've not changed any of it once.

22:04.160 --> 22:06.520
We haven't changed any of the desktop environments.

22:06.520 --> 22:10.360
We have now, it's kind of funny, we have two plasmas and an XFCE.

22:10.360 --> 22:13.360
And that's what it has been since 2018.

22:13.360 --> 22:17.680
Just by constantly thinking about changing an XFCE, but not quite doing it.

22:17.680 --> 22:23.360
But my machine in my office, I mean, it's rare that a desktop environment or distro

22:23.360 --> 22:26.000
makes it three months.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.600
Sometimes it happens.

22:27.600 --> 22:32.240
So it's kind of, for me, it's kind of like it depends on the machine.

22:32.240 --> 22:37.320
One of the things that I have been really enjoying is doing projects on the Raspberry

22:37.320 --> 22:39.200
Pi, Compute Module 4.

22:39.200 --> 22:43.360
And then regardless of what I've done on my machine or what I'm trying, whenever I

22:43.360 --> 22:46.040
want to just try something out, I just SSH into that.

22:46.040 --> 22:47.920
And that's been working really well for me.

22:47.920 --> 22:52.280
Now for another piece of mail, Lily writes in, just writing in about Flatpak.

22:52.280 --> 22:56.240
It has made it much easier for me to choose whatever distro I want.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.240
I was a long time Ubuntu user who gave Pop!

22:58.240 --> 23:01.160
OS a try and really liked Flatpaks.

23:01.160 --> 23:04.400
Now I'm on Fedora and get to use the same apps the same way.

23:04.400 --> 23:11.380
Also one of my most used apps is an older 68k Mac emulator named Bazilisk 2 that is

23:11.380 --> 23:17.320
not always included in distro repos and is a royal pain to build from source.

23:17.320 --> 23:22.480
The Flatpak has made it so easy to install and use that emulator for retro games and

23:22.480 --> 23:24.760
distraction-free writing on all my machines.

23:24.760 --> 23:29.220
I don't see myself going back to installing RPMs or Debs for most apps.

23:29.220 --> 23:33.200
Love the shows, have been listening since the days of the Linux action show.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.720
You guys make the best Linux content, period.

23:35.720 --> 23:36.720
Best Lily.

23:36.720 --> 23:37.720
P.S.

23:37.720 --> 23:42.160
When I moved to Brooklyn, I got Fios for $60 a month and it is glorious having a symmetrical

23:42.160 --> 23:44.600
500 meg connection over Ethernet.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.640
I think a little poke there at the end.

23:46.640 --> 23:50.760
We're jealous, but we're happy for you.

23:50.760 --> 23:55.600
But I think that really touches on sort of the exploration we've been having with Flatpaks

23:55.600 --> 24:01.900
in that, you know, we heard last episode about Endless OS and the extensive use of Flatpaks

24:01.900 --> 24:03.720
Will is using.

24:03.720 --> 24:06.440
And this is kind of a curious use to me.

24:06.440 --> 24:12.480
I was I was asking you guys, I think off channel, how do I move from distro to distro without

24:12.480 --> 24:15.320
necessarily needing to configure everything all the time?

24:15.320 --> 24:17.640
And do you think this might be one of those answers?

24:17.640 --> 24:19.760
Well, it can help you with the part of getting your applications.

24:19.760 --> 24:24.300
You don't have to worry about different package names or setting up, you know, PPAs or adding

24:24.300 --> 24:28.480
repositories in a different distribution and how you might go about that.

24:28.480 --> 24:31.120
The config stuff, though, some of that will still be on you.

24:31.120 --> 24:35.800
Yeah, I guess the nice thing it does, though, is it enforces a separation of applications

24:35.800 --> 24:37.960
and data, which is already pretty good on Linux.

24:37.960 --> 24:40.120
But this really kind of makes it a hard line.

24:40.120 --> 24:46.400
I think it also touches on our conversation around who objects and who it matters to.

24:46.400 --> 24:50.540
Like, I certainly sympathize with a lot of the recent criticisms of Flatpak and with

24:50.540 --> 24:54.440
containers and just, you know, bloat in software and everything getting more abstract and more

24:54.440 --> 24:56.920
complicated and layers and layers and layers.

24:56.920 --> 25:01.600
But you also see that, you know, for some users who aren't clued into that or just

25:01.600 --> 25:03.920
don't care, like, the experience works.

25:03.920 --> 25:06.400
I think we have to reflect on that too, right?

25:06.400 --> 25:07.400
That's why this is hard.

25:07.400 --> 25:09.460
And that's why software is so much about these trade offs.

25:09.460 --> 25:13.180
I have to say, I felt like it was a big relief when I got Flathub up and going with zero

25:13.180 --> 25:17.220
effort on Stream 9 because it just meant, oh, well, there's all my applications then.

25:17.220 --> 25:21.000
Even if they're not in the official repo, I just got all my apps that I really need.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
That was nice.

25:22.000 --> 25:27.340
Well, over to the opposite end of the spectrum, Sean writes in wondering about no love for

25:27.340 --> 25:28.340
Slackware.

25:28.340 --> 25:33.040
With a lack of coverage about Slackware pretty much everywhere nowadays, I was surprised

25:33.040 --> 25:36.440
to learn that the project is still alive and kicking.

25:36.440 --> 25:37.440
Why so much silence?

25:37.440 --> 25:40.380
Has it just faded into obscurity over the years?

25:40.380 --> 25:43.720
Has it become the redheaded stepchild of the Linux community?

25:43.720 --> 25:46.080
I call for a Slackware server in the future.

25:46.080 --> 25:50.400
I'm curious to know your opinions on where it stands among the crowd.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.240
I'm not opposed to a Slackware server.

25:53.240 --> 25:54.240
I must hate myself.

25:54.240 --> 25:55.240
Yeah.

25:55.240 --> 25:56.960
When's the last time you really dove into Slackware?

25:56.960 --> 26:01.000
I mean, we gave it a go on the show a few years ago, but it's probably been at least

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
that long, right?

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Yeah.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Yeah, that's basically it.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.200
You know, Slackware, we really talk about it when people write in asking why we don't

26:07.200 --> 26:11.200
talk about Slackware, and that's almost exclusively it these days.

26:11.200 --> 26:16.360
And the reason for that is, and I mean this with no disrespect, there's just not a lot

26:16.360 --> 26:17.360
going on, right?

26:17.360 --> 26:25.560
I mean, Slackware is a tried and true steady hand, and as a result, there's not a lot of

26:25.560 --> 26:27.480
new things to talk about.

26:27.480 --> 26:32.420
And so with the pace that Slackware moves, you know, it's not really that bad to really

26:32.420 --> 26:35.160
check in every few years and just kind of see how things are going.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.720
So that's about the pace we take it here on the show.

26:37.720 --> 26:38.720
2017.

26:38.720 --> 26:41.080
That's apparently our last Slackware challenge.

26:41.080 --> 26:42.640
Maybe there's another one since then.

26:42.640 --> 26:43.640
Okay.

26:43.640 --> 26:44.640
All right.

26:44.640 --> 26:46.120
Well, time flies when you're having fun.

26:46.120 --> 26:50.200
You know, I did a little search too because I was curious when's the last time we mentioned

26:50.200 --> 26:51.200
it.

26:51.200 --> 26:55.840
And I used our notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com, which I don't think we mentioned enough.

26:55.840 --> 26:59.600
You can sort of search through all the show notes of all the shows, which made it very

26:59.600 --> 27:00.600
easy for me.

27:00.600 --> 27:07.600
But the last mention of it, at least in our show notes on JB, was in Linux Action News

27:07.600 --> 27:12.040
64, which is a little while ago.

27:12.040 --> 27:19.360
And the mention was about some potential financial struggles that I'm guessing have been addressed

27:19.360 --> 27:21.200
because that was quite a long time ago.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.440
But you're right.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.380
It doesn't really show up that much, does it?

27:25.380 --> 27:27.160
We need a Slackware investigation.

27:27.160 --> 27:32.160
And then, Brent, you report in like a reporter standing outside of Slackware HQ, which is

27:32.160 --> 27:33.560
probably some guy's house, right?

27:33.560 --> 27:38.160
And then you just got the microphone and you're reporting live from Slackware HQ with an update

27:38.160 --> 27:39.160
on the financial situation.

27:39.160 --> 27:42.360
But first, we'll have to get the news copter to get you out there in the news van so we

27:42.360 --> 27:43.360
can do the broadcast.

27:43.360 --> 27:47.440
But once we get the copter in the van, then we'll send Brent down to Slackware HQ and

27:47.440 --> 27:48.440
figure out what's going on.

27:48.440 --> 27:52.520
Live from the scene, still no updates, and I'm being asked to leave.

27:52.520 --> 27:54.600
And it has started to rain.

27:54.600 --> 27:57.980
I don't quite understand what's happening here.

27:57.980 --> 28:00.480
That's all we have today for our Slackware news.

28:00.480 --> 28:02.200
I do think you're right, though, Chris.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.940
Like the value proposition of Slackware has kind of just faded a bit.

28:04.940 --> 28:05.940
Not that it's bad.

28:05.940 --> 28:09.240
I think we all still have a lot of respect, maybe even love for Slackware.

28:09.240 --> 28:11.880
But you know, there's systems like Gentoo.

28:11.880 --> 28:12.880
There's things like Nix.

28:12.880 --> 28:16.040
And if you just like want to assemble your system, but still with the help of a package

28:16.040 --> 28:17.800
manager, well, Arch is quite popular.

28:17.800 --> 28:22.420
So I'm just not sure that there's that many users that Slackware is unique enough to really

28:22.420 --> 28:25.880
draw unless you've been using it for a long time.

28:25.880 --> 28:27.720
You know, I am genuinely curious.

28:27.720 --> 28:29.520
I will admit, I don't know Slackware that well.

28:29.520 --> 28:34.360
So could some of you with more experience than I do sort of give me what that proposition,

28:34.360 --> 28:39.360
that value proposition really was in Slackware's heyday, if it had such a thing?

28:39.360 --> 28:42.760
Mini-Mech, I know you gave it a go for a bit a little more recently.

28:42.760 --> 28:43.760
More recently?

28:43.760 --> 28:44.760
No, I can't really say that.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.400
It was like 10 years ago.

28:46.400 --> 28:52.920
I felt really ready to test all existing distributions that existed.

28:52.920 --> 28:57.680
So I tried Slack, I tried Gentoo and everything.

28:57.680 --> 29:03.440
And Slackware was probably my fastest Linux experience besides Gentoo.

29:03.440 --> 29:08.160
I used Gentoo for like for three weeks and then I gave up because it took too much time

29:08.160 --> 29:10.480
to get my package up to date.

29:10.480 --> 29:13.600
And with Slackware, it was more like the package gap.

29:13.600 --> 29:19.960
If I remember well, I had to import some special repository to have the GNOME desktop because

29:19.960 --> 29:22.880
it was not included as default.

29:22.880 --> 29:27.360
And I was missing some packages, but the experience was really, really good.

29:27.360 --> 29:31.920
I feel like Slackware, it's a good educational experience.

29:31.920 --> 29:37.480
If you really want to get an experience for where Linux has been and how far it's come,

29:37.480 --> 29:42.320
giving Slackware a go, even though it's been modernized as it has, I think is still a pretty

29:42.320 --> 29:46.400
good taste of what that experience is like.

29:46.400 --> 29:47.800
That's not me being dismissive.

29:47.800 --> 29:54.140
It's just I don't really have a particular interest to revisit it anymore.

29:54.140 --> 29:56.240
Just like you'll never let us try Linux from scratch.

29:56.240 --> 29:58.560
Well, you can go right ahead.

29:58.560 --> 30:00.720
How about you, Wimpy?

30:00.720 --> 30:02.360
Have you tried out Slackware recently?

30:02.360 --> 30:03.760
No, not recently.

30:03.760 --> 30:08.200
But you're asking, you know, why did I choose Slackware?

30:08.200 --> 30:14.080
And the reason was, is it was the only usable distro that existed at that time, which would

30:14.080 --> 30:17.780
have been 95, something like that.

30:17.780 --> 30:19.880
That's what there was before Debian.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.440
That's why you used it.

30:21.440 --> 30:22.440
Right.

30:22.440 --> 30:23.440
Yeah.

30:23.440 --> 30:27.320
I don't actually know when Debian started, so that would be an interesting time point.

30:27.320 --> 30:32.640
But certainly, when I was looking for a Linux, my first Linux was Idrassil.

30:32.640 --> 30:39.960
And when I moved from that, Slackware was the distro that had the most momentum around

30:39.960 --> 30:41.320
it at that time.

30:41.320 --> 30:42.320
Debian was 1993.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.320
Wow.

30:43.320 --> 30:44.320
There you go.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.320
Red Hat was 95.

30:46.320 --> 30:49.080
SUSE was 93 as well.

30:49.080 --> 30:54.520
I used Red Hat and Slackware along, you know, side by side on different systems back then.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.520
Right.

30:55.520 --> 30:59.960
Even though I'm not particularly compelled to use it anymore, I would be very sad if

30:59.960 --> 31:01.480
Slackware were to go away.

31:01.480 --> 31:05.040
It feels like a bit of living history.

31:05.040 --> 31:08.960
And so, Patrick and whoever helps him, or maybe it's just Patrick now, whoever keeps

31:08.960 --> 31:13.640
it alive, I am extremely grateful that they continue to do so.

31:13.640 --> 31:19.160
And along those lines, OpenSUSE, which I believe very, very early on started life perhaps from

31:19.160 --> 31:21.960
Slackware, has been a topic on the show.

31:21.960 --> 31:25.960
Some of you have noticed sort of a shift in tone.

31:25.960 --> 31:26.960
Kind of funny.

31:26.960 --> 31:27.960
I didn't grab a clip, Wes.

31:27.960 --> 31:29.320
Did I grab a clip, Wes?

31:29.320 --> 31:30.560
I don't think so.

31:30.560 --> 31:35.600
But we went back and we listened to the first episode of Linux Unplugged of 2021 of the

31:35.600 --> 31:36.600
current year.

31:36.600 --> 31:39.640
It's us really having a go at SUSE.

31:39.640 --> 31:43.320
I mean, really giving SUSE both barrels.

31:43.320 --> 31:45.640
Not satisfied, not happy.

31:45.640 --> 31:48.160
Very dissatisfied customers.

31:48.160 --> 31:52.360
It was kind of, well, it was a bit rough.

31:52.360 --> 31:55.320
Some of you have noted a bit of a tone shift recently.

31:55.320 --> 31:59.680
And Matt writes in, he says, it did my little lizard heart good to hear all of the OpenSUSE

31:59.680 --> 32:00.900
love.

32:00.900 --> 32:03.800
It was good to hear Chris appreciating the improvements to YAST as well.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.740
I wanted to point out a couple of things.

32:05.740 --> 32:07.720
Number one, YAST is amazing.

32:07.720 --> 32:12.400
But if you're a command line config type sysadmin, all those things are still available in there

32:12.400 --> 32:14.320
right where you would expect them to be.

32:14.320 --> 32:17.780
You can use YAST to change your hostname, but then you can also use hostnamectl like

32:17.780 --> 32:18.940
you would anywhere else.

32:18.940 --> 32:25.200
So right there, I got to say for me personally, that's one of the major things that has made

32:25.200 --> 32:28.480
this SUSE transition go so much smoother for me.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.920
Because I decided to learn zipper.

32:30.920 --> 32:34.640
And I've just been like, when I wanted to change my hostname, that was one of the things

32:34.640 --> 32:37.400
I decided to do with hostnamectl.

32:37.400 --> 32:40.400
I still think the experience falls down for me in YAST.

32:40.400 --> 32:41.480
It's better.

32:41.480 --> 32:42.480
It's cleaner.

32:42.480 --> 32:43.720
It's more focused.

32:43.720 --> 32:47.200
But I legitimately was confused on how I was supposed to change my hostname in YAST.

32:47.200 --> 32:48.200
I went in there and took a look.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.200
I think we both were.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.200
I mean, yeah, right?

32:50.200 --> 32:51.200
Yeah.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.200
So I just said, screw it.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.960
And I was really grateful that the command line tools were there.

32:53.960 --> 32:57.520
I will say I respect the design of that, that both things work.

32:57.520 --> 33:00.600
It's not like you have to use YAST and YAST tramples on the system necessarily.

33:00.600 --> 33:04.560
So that's appreciated, even if we don't actually opt into really using it much.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.240
It's sort of the perfect sweet spot, isn't it?

33:06.240 --> 33:10.840
Because it means people who do want a tool like that are free to use it.

33:10.840 --> 33:12.720
They can graduate up beyond that if they want.

33:12.720 --> 33:13.720
They don't have to.

33:13.720 --> 33:18.620
And people who want to use the tools at the command line are not penalized either.

33:18.620 --> 33:22.560
And I think that's been sort of my takeaway as I've kind of, oh, boy, I'm going to lay

33:22.560 --> 33:23.600
it out there.

33:23.600 --> 33:24.600
I don't know.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.080
This is all subject to change.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.880
It's all subject to change.

33:27.880 --> 33:33.920
But right now, if our new Tumbleweed server goes well, the one we're deploying at the

33:33.920 --> 33:39.000
start of the new year, if that's smooth, what I think I want to do, and I don't know how

33:39.000 --> 33:43.640
the hell we'd actually do this, but what I'm kind of aiming towards is using this as an

33:43.640 --> 33:49.840
opportunity to really get my head around Ansible and then come up with a totally new Linode

33:49.840 --> 33:53.960
infrastructure layout, all based on OpenSUSE Elite.

33:53.960 --> 34:00.640
So we're talking a lot of Linodes, and we're talking like wiping it all, because right

34:00.640 --> 34:05.220
now we have a mix of Fedora and Ubuntu and some CentOS.

34:05.220 --> 34:09.720
And I do have a couple of custom VPN boxes that would remain untouched.

34:09.720 --> 34:14.600
But if this Tumbleweed transition we're going to do here on our server goes well, and the

34:14.600 --> 34:19.740
Tumbleweed that I'm testing on this Raspberry Pi continues to go well, I may also go Tumbleweed

34:19.740 --> 34:24.960
on my Pis at home, and if all of those go well, then I'm going to start trying out Leap.

34:24.960 --> 34:28.780
And if Leap goes well, we're going to nuke and pave our Linode infrastructure and move

34:28.780 --> 34:32.540
it all over to Leap and have it deployed with an Ansible playbook.

34:32.540 --> 34:33.740
That's the angle I'm going.

34:33.740 --> 34:38.040
That's how much my opinion is shifting on the SUSE stuff.

34:38.040 --> 34:42.880
And a big influencer here is actually the value add that I feel like they bring to the

34:42.880 --> 34:43.880
tools.

34:43.880 --> 34:45.840
It feels like there's some actual engineering.

34:45.840 --> 34:49.760
Fiverr has been designed in a way that it displays the information to the user in a

34:49.760 --> 34:51.640
very readable format.

34:51.640 --> 34:56.260
It is easy to understand what your next choices are, what the pros and cons are, what they

34:56.260 --> 34:57.260
suggest you do.

34:57.260 --> 34:59.200
It's all very well laid out.

34:59.200 --> 35:03.360
Your eyes focus on the right part, and it proceeds at a pretty nice pace, and it displays

35:03.360 --> 35:04.600
progress in a nice way.

35:04.600 --> 35:08.960
It feels like a mature setup, you know, from, it seems like, as you, you know, someone who

35:08.960 --> 35:11.900
used to admin a lot of servers, you jumped in, you're like, oh, yeah, this is great.

35:11.900 --> 35:13.000
So friendly and comfy.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
I can get stuff done.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.080
Yeah, and it's just enough of, hey, man, you know, you're on Tumbleweed, and you want to

35:18.080 --> 35:19.080
do an update.

35:19.080 --> 35:24.600
You know, use this command, because, you know, here's a little bit of information about that.

35:24.600 --> 35:28.600
And it's just enough for me to go, oh, OK, so I need to switch over to using this now.

35:28.600 --> 35:29.600
That's good to know.

35:29.600 --> 35:30.600
Good to know.

35:30.600 --> 35:31.760
Didn't blow up my whole system there.

35:31.760 --> 35:34.840
And there's just that little bits of value added throughout the OS.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.680
I feel very similar about DNF.

35:36.680 --> 35:40.560
I feel like that's a really good tool, and there's a similar kind of engineering and

35:40.560 --> 35:44.560
tooling around the Red Hat and CentOS and Fedora distros.

35:44.560 --> 35:48.600
That's one of the things that's been drawing me in there is I can, as an end user, I can

35:48.600 --> 35:50.960
perceive a bit of the engineering going into it.

35:50.960 --> 35:54.240
And that is not to say Canonical doesn't do the same, because they build some really

35:54.240 --> 35:57.480
cool tools, like the stuff around LexD and, of course, the stuff around some of their

35:57.480 --> 36:01.280
quick VMs and, of course, the snap tooling and all that stuff.

36:01.280 --> 36:05.240
Like, there's a lot of value that they add on top of, like, the centralized management

36:05.240 --> 36:06.800
stuff and the live patching stuff.

36:06.800 --> 36:12.120
So there's genuine value out there, but my type of use of a system, I'm using the command

36:12.120 --> 36:13.560
line package management tools.

36:13.560 --> 36:14.560
I'm using that stuff.

36:14.560 --> 36:19.840
I'm not using the stuff that, like, enterprises find value that Canonical adds.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.180
It's the tooling for me.

36:21.180 --> 36:22.520
That's what I'm interfacing with.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.960
And that, well, that's built by Debian.

36:24.960 --> 36:29.880
And Debian, they're not particularly motivated to drastically change apt in any particular

36:29.880 --> 36:34.000
way or maybe completely refactor the way it displays its updates or its outputs.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.780
Like, that's just not really on their radar.

36:36.780 --> 36:38.600
And so Ubuntu is not really going to get that.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.820
You know, they're not going to want to replace the built-in tooling that would just go over

36:41.820 --> 36:44.200
like a lead balloon, but SUSE can.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.520
They are their own upstream, right?

36:45.520 --> 36:47.520
They can do that kind of stuff.

36:47.520 --> 36:48.880
And so they have.

36:48.880 --> 36:54.480
And as an end user who appreciates a little bit of nice engineering, I'm seeing that the

36:54.480 --> 36:56.680
more I use it, and that's appealing to me.

36:56.680 --> 37:01.560
Now, snapshots, their early adoption of ButterFS and building the tooling around that, that

37:01.560 --> 37:03.400
also has been appealing to me.

37:03.400 --> 37:04.400
And so those things I like.

37:04.400 --> 37:07.400
But the one thing we don't talk about in this conversation is the build service.

37:07.400 --> 37:10.080
The open SUSE build service, which Matt points out.

37:10.080 --> 37:12.160
And he says, that's really where it gets great.

37:12.160 --> 37:14.240
It works really nice with Zipper too.

37:14.240 --> 37:19.100
And if anybody's going to scale in March, Matt invites us to stop by the KDE OpenSUSE

37:19.100 --> 37:22.520
NextCloud League of Professional System Admins booth and say hi.

37:22.520 --> 37:23.520
Oh, nice.

37:23.520 --> 37:24.520
Say hi to Matt.

37:24.520 --> 37:25.520
Yeah.

37:25.520 --> 37:27.240
So, God, I hope scale happens.

37:27.240 --> 37:28.240
That would be great.

37:28.240 --> 37:32.320
It's so tempting that conference season might just be starting again in a weird, normal

37:32.320 --> 37:33.480
capacity.

37:33.480 --> 37:34.800
We can dream, right?

37:34.800 --> 37:40.980
If you want to hear our old take on Tumbleweed, check out linuxunplugged.com slash 387.

37:40.980 --> 37:47.360
While speaking of ButterFS, Marcel writes in, hey Chris, Wes, and sometimes Brent.

37:47.360 --> 37:50.720
My question for you is, why is my ButterFS so slow?

37:50.720 --> 37:54.440
I know you're big fans and even recommended as a root drive for servers.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.800
So I'm hoping maybe you've got some tips.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.400
I switched to ButterFS about six months ago.

37:59.400 --> 38:04.440
And while the snapshots are great and have saved my butt countless times already, the

38:04.440 --> 38:06.460
performance seems pretty bad.

38:06.460 --> 38:10.620
This is mostly anecdotal, but if I'm copying files in the background, my UI can freeze

38:10.620 --> 38:13.120
for 30 seconds at a time.

38:13.120 --> 38:16.520
You can probably imagine how frustrating this is when you're trying to get work done.

38:16.520 --> 38:21.420
I seek out lightweight software like OpenVox and NeoVim, but still, these usually super

38:21.420 --> 38:23.640
speedy programs just hang.

38:23.640 --> 38:27.800
I read every guide I could and I'm using all the recommended boot flags.

38:27.800 --> 38:33.020
So do you have any ButterFS tips that might not show up in those popular guides?

38:33.020 --> 38:36.940
Is any of this consistent with your experience, or is there something terribly wrong with

38:36.940 --> 38:37.940
my setup?

38:37.940 --> 38:41.780
I know you're not my personal tech support, but I thought maybe other listeners would

38:41.780 --> 38:45.920
be interested in how to go about diagnosing their ButterFS issues.

38:45.920 --> 38:49.320
Doesn't Marcel know no one's allowed to have ButterFS complaints in here?

38:49.320 --> 38:51.680
This is a, no, this is only, we only hype ButterFS.

38:51.680 --> 38:52.680
Strictly hype.

38:52.680 --> 38:53.680
That's all we want here.

38:53.680 --> 38:54.680
Yeah.

38:54.680 --> 38:55.680
How do you get past the filters anyways?

38:55.680 --> 38:56.680
I don't know.

38:56.680 --> 38:57.680
I don't know.

38:57.680 --> 38:58.680
I don't know.

38:58.680 --> 38:59.680
So a couple of things.

38:59.680 --> 39:04.520
When I hear about disk activity impacting your graphical applications, I do start wondering

39:04.520 --> 39:07.620
about like your scheduler and I do start going in that direction.

39:07.620 --> 39:12.360
But I was wondering, is LZO, is that the fastest compression available now or would something

39:12.360 --> 39:16.440
like Zstandard be faster and is that usable with ButterFS?

39:16.440 --> 39:21.800
LZO is technically the fastest, but the better balance is Zstandard 1.

39:21.800 --> 39:25.740
We actually did a report for this for turning on compression in Fedora.

39:25.740 --> 39:29.360
So you can look it up in the Fedora Zstandard change for ButterFS.

39:29.360 --> 39:30.360
All right, great.

39:30.360 --> 39:34.720
It does seem like maybe looking at Fedora's justification for using the Zstandard compression

39:34.720 --> 39:36.600
might be something worth looking at.

39:36.600 --> 39:40.840
But all things being equal to one terabyte SATA SSDs and a RAID 0, you should actually

39:40.840 --> 39:47.080
be fine because I've actually done something similar where I have two one terabyte SSDs

39:47.080 --> 39:54.040
that are USB and I'm not getting that kind of, yeah, I'm not getting that kind of, kind

39:54.040 --> 39:55.040
of experience.

39:55.040 --> 39:59.440
So you might look into what's going on just overall in your system.

39:59.440 --> 40:03.860
Maybe have the journal up in a follow mode while you're using your system.

40:03.860 --> 40:07.720
Check in logs, maybe install something like NetData so you can see if there's anomalous

40:07.720 --> 40:09.780
stuff going on with your disks.

40:09.780 --> 40:11.320
Take a look at the health of your disks.

40:11.320 --> 40:14.280
And then I'm also just curious, what kernel version are you on?

40:14.280 --> 40:17.240
Are you running a new or somewhat new ButterFS?

40:17.240 --> 40:18.760
All of that would be helpful diagnostically.

40:18.760 --> 40:23.640
Yeah, we also got an email in just as a tip for those of you who've been using Nebula since

40:23.640 --> 40:24.640
we talked about it.

40:24.640 --> 40:29.480
Joe wanted you to know that, not Joe that edits our show, but listener Joe, that Nebula

40:29.480 --> 40:33.320
certs by default do expire after a year.

40:33.320 --> 40:34.740
So prepare yourselves for that.

40:34.740 --> 40:37.340
Just a little bit of housekeeping on your Nebula VPNs.

40:37.340 --> 40:41.400
That is a mesh VPN that we've talked about before that we like a lot, but I'll take our

40:41.400 --> 40:42.400
last email.

40:42.400 --> 40:43.700
Well, this will probably be our last one.

40:43.700 --> 40:45.600
This is a good one I think to end on.

40:45.600 --> 40:51.440
So our good friend, Tim Kanem from JPL, former guest on the show wrote in and he said, I

40:51.440 --> 40:56.800
got a good chuckle at your command line episode, since as you can guess, the command line rules

40:56.800 --> 41:00.280
on Mars, GUIs aren't much help there.

41:00.280 --> 41:04.060
As we've learned how the helicopter likes to operate on Mars, we've actually been learning

41:04.060 --> 41:07.940
more command line tricks to help things go more smoothly.

41:07.940 --> 41:13.200
We're using task set dash C to put operations on other cores so they don't interfere with

41:13.200 --> 41:15.780
the core that has the critical timing on it.

41:15.780 --> 41:22.020
And chrt tach O, which is C-H-R-T tach O, to lower the priority of those tasks relative

41:22.020 --> 41:23.620
to the critical cores.

41:23.620 --> 41:28.080
But as a general comment, I agreed with Wimpy that the distinctive thing of Linux is the

41:28.080 --> 41:29.240
command line.

41:29.240 --> 41:34.400
So much that even though most of my day is spent in Windows because of the office centric

41:34.400 --> 41:43.040
business world, I do almost all of my development work on a Linux machine or in WSL2 under Windows.

41:43.040 --> 41:47.920
Once JPL is open again, by the way, it'd be so fun to organize a tour of JPL for the L.A.

41:47.920 --> 41:51.200
area Linux unplugged listeners will be in touch.

41:51.200 --> 41:58.280
How awesome would that be to do a meet up at JPL in the L.A. area and get a tour of

41:58.280 --> 42:01.080
the Mars base HQ for the little rover and helicopter?

42:01.080 --> 42:02.080
Oh, wow.

42:02.080 --> 42:03.800
That's, I just can't even.

42:03.800 --> 42:04.800
It's so great Tim's listening.

42:04.800 --> 42:05.800
I love that.

42:05.800 --> 42:06.800
And he's got a great point.

42:06.800 --> 42:08.000
Like you're not going to be using the GUI on Mars.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.200
There are a lot of industrial applications where the command line is going to be your

42:11.200 --> 42:12.200
only bet.

42:12.200 --> 42:17.080
It doesn't mean it's the only way you should be able to do things, but there will be times

42:17.080 --> 42:19.120
where there's no avoiding it.

42:19.120 --> 42:22.200
OK, all right.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.200
Are you ready, Wes?

42:23.200 --> 42:24.200
All right.

42:24.200 --> 42:25.200
How are you feeling?

42:25.200 --> 42:27.720
I mean, I feel like we could do it, even if it's not even if we're not 100 percent yet.

42:27.720 --> 42:33.080
Yeah, I think we have to because I'm still running into some issues on the backend side.

42:33.080 --> 42:34.360
We'll just ask for grace.

42:34.360 --> 42:36.080
We'll just ask for grace.

42:36.080 --> 42:44.420
Behind the scenes, Wes has been working diligently to plumb together every single member version

42:44.420 --> 42:52.180
of the show into one master membership feed so you can subscribe to one place and get

42:52.180 --> 42:58.220
access to all the member benefits for every show, support the entire network.

42:58.220 --> 43:02.520
And it's also now giftable for the holidays.

43:02.520 --> 43:08.460
So if you'd like to join a Jupiter Broadcasting Network membership, it's really simple.

43:08.460 --> 43:12.080
It's just the price of two memberships, but you'll get access to four special feeds plus

43:12.080 --> 43:14.800
whatever new stuff that we add in the future.

43:14.800 --> 43:18.440
So you sign up at Jupiter.party.

43:18.440 --> 43:21.520
That's where you can go to get it for yourself or you can go there if you'd like to gift

43:21.520 --> 43:22.520
it to someone.

43:22.520 --> 43:25.240
That's been a big request we've had and now we've made it happen.

43:25.240 --> 43:26.240
Come join our party.

43:26.240 --> 43:27.240
Yeah, come join our party.

43:27.240 --> 43:28.340
It took some paperwork.

43:28.340 --> 43:29.800
It took some technical work.

43:29.800 --> 43:36.560
It's been in the works, but it means now you get every show completely ad-free.

43:36.560 --> 43:40.140
Not limited ads, completely ad-free.

43:40.140 --> 43:42.560
That same upgrade is going out to every existing membership.

43:42.560 --> 43:46.960
So if you're a member of just a single podcast, it's going 100% ad-free for you.

43:46.960 --> 43:51.320
If it hasn't yet, it will soon with maybe just one or two things you'll find out.

43:51.320 --> 43:55.920
But it's all coming together right now where we've been working very diligently on this.

43:55.920 --> 44:00.920
If you sign up for the Jupiter.party whole network membership, you get access to the

44:00.920 --> 44:01.920
unplugged full live stream.

44:01.920 --> 44:04.120
That's what we're going to be putting in that feed.

44:04.120 --> 44:07.060
You get self-hosted with the member post-show.

44:07.060 --> 44:10.900
You get Coder Radio ad-free and the Coderly report.

44:10.900 --> 44:12.520
It's all just for 16 bucks a month.

44:12.520 --> 44:14.360
That's just the cost of two memberships.

44:14.360 --> 44:19.520
But because it's the holidays, I'm taking $2 off for a year if you use the promo code

44:19.520 --> 44:20.960
TheSignal.

44:20.960 --> 44:24.000
One word, TheSignal.

44:24.000 --> 44:29.160
These memberships, they keep our production going in a time right now where we've, actually

44:29.160 --> 44:34.120
for quite a while, we've only had Linode now sponsoring the show.

44:34.120 --> 44:37.080
Without these memberships, one sponsor, that just wouldn't, that wouldn't, that wouldn't

44:37.080 --> 44:38.080
work.

44:38.080 --> 44:39.080
They just couldn't do it.

44:39.080 --> 44:40.080
It wouldn't make business sense to run the show.

44:40.080 --> 44:44.440
But our members, they give us the choice to wait for the right sponsorship.

44:44.440 --> 44:49.400
And it takes a long time to find the right sponsor and to work out a relationship that's

44:49.400 --> 44:51.920
equitable and that makes sense and that's fair to everybody.

44:51.920 --> 44:57.840
But that stuff, it takes sometimes six months for a single deal that you'll hear for a single

44:57.840 --> 44:58.840
read you'll hear on air.

44:58.840 --> 45:00.960
I mean, it's unbelievable.

45:00.960 --> 45:04.280
And the memberships, they give us that lifeline to be picky.

45:04.280 --> 45:10.440
So you're not hearing every single mattress ad or a box meal.

45:10.440 --> 45:14.220
The ones that we hear a lot from are like the Loot Crate type stuff where you can sign

45:14.220 --> 45:16.220
up and get a box full of junk.

45:16.220 --> 45:17.560
We don't have to take those.

45:17.560 --> 45:20.400
We can be picky about who we work with and choose the right sponsor.

45:20.400 --> 45:22.080
Our members help us do that.

45:22.080 --> 45:23.080
They help us when it's lean.

45:23.080 --> 45:24.080
They help us stay independent.

45:24.080 --> 45:30.600
I mean, it's a really big deal when independent content like this is funded from its audience.

45:30.600 --> 45:34.240
You just look at what's going on in the media today and I think you can appreciate how important

45:34.240 --> 45:35.280
that is.

45:35.280 --> 45:37.500
So go over to Jupiter.party to sign up.

45:37.500 --> 45:41.460
If you're a Jupiter Signal patron on our Patreon, you're already set.

45:41.460 --> 45:43.460
You're just going to have to claim your feed.

45:43.460 --> 45:45.960
There's a process for that and we'll do a Patreon post for that.

45:45.960 --> 45:49.840
It's just a limitations of APIs and tech platforms.

45:49.840 --> 45:53.000
But Jupiter Signal patrons, you're already good to go.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.400
You're going to get access to this stuff.

45:54.400 --> 46:00.320
As we talk right now, Wes is going through and backfilling the feed with all of the previous

46:00.320 --> 46:02.860
membership releases for every show.

46:02.860 --> 46:07.520
So if you've never been a member before, you can now get access to everything in one feed,

46:07.520 --> 46:08.520
one spot.

46:08.520 --> 46:10.880
You'll also get access to exclusive.

46:10.880 --> 46:14.720
If you don't want that, you can go into the membership portal and just download the things

46:14.720 --> 46:17.600
you do want from time to time so you don't actually have to take the feed if you don't

46:17.600 --> 46:18.600
want it.

46:18.600 --> 46:19.600
You can still just support us.

46:19.600 --> 46:20.600
That's all you have to do.

46:20.600 --> 46:21.600
All the great content.

46:21.600 --> 46:22.600
None of the ads.

46:22.600 --> 46:25.520
And I wouldn't be surprised if there aren't a few kinks we work out with the feed stuff

46:25.520 --> 46:32.720
just as we're importing like these live stream recordings are super huge files, really long.

46:32.720 --> 46:37.120
So it's a lot of processing, but it's all happening right now.

46:37.120 --> 46:41.200
And when you go to Jupiter.party and you sign up, you'll get an RSS feed and you'll see

46:41.200 --> 46:42.760
that start populating.

46:42.760 --> 46:46.660
And you can use promo code The Signal to take two bucks off that membership for a year.

46:46.660 --> 46:49.160
So not only is it a great deal because it's the cost of two memberships and you're getting

46:49.160 --> 46:54.240
access to all the shows, but then if you use the promo code The Signal, which is only going

46:54.240 --> 46:58.360
to be active for a few weeks, you get two bucks off every month for a year.

46:58.360 --> 47:02.360
Jupiter.party, promo code The Signal, network wide membership is here.

47:02.360 --> 47:05.820
It's been a massively requested feature.

47:05.820 --> 47:09.720
And it was one of these where I had to figure out some business stuff because, you know,

47:09.720 --> 47:13.320
I mean, going completely ad free, that takes some work.

47:13.320 --> 47:16.760
You know, that's why it was limited ads before.

47:16.760 --> 47:21.260
And then, of course, there's back end plumbing we have to do for our publishing system.

47:21.260 --> 47:24.880
And then we have different platforms like Patreon that we had to connect.

47:24.880 --> 47:29.000
It turns out when you publish your podcast to every possible place, it gets complicated.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
It does.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
It does.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.380
So I'm very excited for that.

47:32.380 --> 47:33.480
And thank you, everybody who signs up.

47:33.480 --> 47:34.680
Thank you, Wes, for the hard work.

47:34.680 --> 47:37.680
Let's give them another round of applause.

47:37.680 --> 47:39.420
Jupiter.party.

47:39.420 --> 47:44.200
And you can gift it now, which when I first set up the memberships, I thought I didn't

47:44.200 --> 47:45.200
even cross my mind, actually.

47:45.200 --> 47:47.120
I never even thought about it.

47:47.120 --> 47:51.480
But then as the year went on, people were like, I'd like to gift it.

47:51.480 --> 47:52.640
Every holiday season they would come up.

47:52.640 --> 47:53.760
I'm probably a little late.

47:53.760 --> 47:54.760
Hopefully not, though.

47:54.760 --> 47:55.760
You know what?

47:55.760 --> 47:56.900
Digital gift you can always get at the last minute.

47:56.900 --> 47:57.900
So there's that, too.

47:57.900 --> 47:58.900
Yeah, that's right.

47:58.900 --> 47:59.900
You forgot.

47:59.900 --> 48:00.900
You forgot what your spouse wanted.

48:00.900 --> 48:01.900
Maybe they want this.

48:01.900 --> 48:04.760
I also have a popcorn knot update.

48:04.760 --> 48:06.480
So I got this little tiny popcorn computer.

48:06.480 --> 48:14.000
It's a really neat little device with a QWERTY keyboard and a 1080p screen and SD card, four

48:14.000 --> 48:16.280
USB-C ports, HDMI.

48:16.280 --> 48:19.040
It's no bigger than a phablet.

48:19.040 --> 48:24.200
But you know, it's early days, and I don't think it's ready for a review so much as it

48:24.200 --> 48:28.620
is it's going to be in the lab in experimentation mode for a bit.

48:28.620 --> 48:33.440
There's a post-market OS image that boots now, and you can even get as far up as to

48:33.440 --> 48:34.440
a graphical environment.

48:34.440 --> 48:38.340
But there's not a lot else going on on this thing right now, and there's still some fundamental

48:38.340 --> 48:41.440
hardware that needs drivers and stuff like that.

48:41.440 --> 48:44.880
So I'm holding off on a full opinion right now, and I'll continue to play with it.

48:44.880 --> 48:48.500
And I'm doing a reach out to anybody in the community who has one of these and has some

48:48.500 --> 48:55.420
experience and would like to sync up with me, chris at jupyterbroadcasting.com for that.

48:55.420 --> 48:58.480
Well before we go, I think we've got time for a pick.

48:58.480 --> 49:03.700
And this one, Chris, oh, it's interesting to you and I because it's an editor for spoken

49:03.700 --> 49:09.520
word audio with automatic transcription, something to maybe make editing those podcasts just

49:09.520 --> 49:11.360
a little bit easier.

49:11.360 --> 49:12.360
It's called Adopolis.

49:12.360 --> 49:15.000
Okay, I'm glad you said that.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.160
That's not how I would have said it.

49:16.160 --> 49:17.640
I'm not sure why I would have said it.

49:17.640 --> 49:19.640
I would have said Adopolis.

49:19.640 --> 49:20.640
And that's stupid.

49:20.640 --> 49:22.440
There's no pfff in there.

49:22.440 --> 49:28.180
So yeah, this is neat, and it's competing with a commercial application that has a monthly

49:28.180 --> 49:30.400
subscription to do all of this.

49:30.400 --> 49:31.580
It's early days.

49:31.580 --> 49:38.800
It's an electron app where you import a video file, an audio file, and then it downloads

49:38.800 --> 49:43.060
a model, they have different options, and then it transcribes it.

49:43.060 --> 49:45.080
And you can go in there and actually highlight sentences.

49:45.080 --> 49:49.040
Now I'll give you, here's a great example of how this would be useful.

49:49.040 --> 49:55.080
Maybe there was a talk on YouTube, maybe an event, and it's like a four-hour YouTube video.

49:55.080 --> 49:58.600
You know how they sometimes just kind of like, they just sometimes kind of slot them all

49:58.600 --> 49:59.600
together?

49:59.600 --> 50:01.480
Publish the rooms video for the whole darn day.

50:01.480 --> 50:04.340
Yeah, and it's like a six-hour video.

50:04.340 --> 50:07.960
You could download something like that, run it through this thing, and then you could

50:07.960 --> 50:11.760
search for the actual words that you're looking for, and then cut it to that.

50:11.760 --> 50:16.040
Because when you make cuts and changes in here, it can make cuts and changes to the

50:16.040 --> 50:18.200
video file, or you can export just that section.

50:18.200 --> 50:24.180
So this is an incredible way to take something that is a visual medium and convert it to

50:24.180 --> 50:25.180
a written medium.

50:25.180 --> 50:31.200
And it gives you a word processor-like experience for media editing, which is just so cool.

50:31.200 --> 50:32.480
And no cloud required.

50:32.480 --> 50:34.680
I never thought I'd see this in a non-commercial capacity.

50:34.680 --> 50:36.480
I mean, this thing's AGPL.

50:36.480 --> 50:40.200
Yes, you can get it on those commercial platforms like Windows and Mac OS, but there's also

50:40.200 --> 50:44.800
an app image available if you just want to play with it on good old GNU slash Linux.

50:44.800 --> 50:45.800
That's just, wow.

50:45.800 --> 50:48.680
I mean, okay, it's definitely really early days.

50:48.680 --> 50:52.920
They stressed that in the readme, and from my quick playing with it, that should be stressed.

50:52.920 --> 50:57.160
But it's pretty slick so far, and it seems like it has a lot of promise.

50:57.160 --> 50:58.160
We all three tried it.

50:58.160 --> 51:00.520
I think, Brent, you probably had the roughest go at it.

51:00.520 --> 51:02.800
I did have an issue running the app image.

51:02.800 --> 51:06.880
It may not be associated with the program, but I got it working via the command line,

51:06.880 --> 51:08.120
which was fine.

51:08.120 --> 51:09.840
And then I got really excited.

51:09.840 --> 51:12.520
It was very, very neat what it was doing.

51:12.520 --> 51:16.440
And like you mentioned, it's early days, so it wasn't quite perfect, but just perfect

51:16.440 --> 51:21.400
enough that it got me all tingly, and it was really, really great, actually, to see when

51:21.400 --> 51:25.000
you hit the play button after it transcribes everything, you can just kind of watch it

51:25.000 --> 51:29.440
read the words with the audio as it follows, which is really cool.

51:29.440 --> 51:35.200
I just used like an Alan Watts speech that I found online, and it even had a little music

51:35.200 --> 51:39.000
symbol for when the piano came in between his words, because you know how he speaks

51:39.000 --> 51:42.740
with gaps in his tone and stuff.

51:42.740 --> 51:43.920
So that was great.

51:43.920 --> 51:49.720
But I did then, just as I was writing my excitement to you guys, it sort of crashed my entire

51:49.720 --> 51:50.720
system.

51:50.720 --> 51:51.720
At least your display server, right?

51:51.720 --> 51:56.000
Yeah, you had a sense of what was going on, so it kind of kicked me out into the terminal,

51:56.000 --> 52:00.960
and I tried my very best to get back and never could without a reboot.

52:00.960 --> 52:06.840
So that felt a little disappointing, but hopefully we can help them with that, or they're working

52:06.840 --> 52:08.120
on it, something like that.

52:08.120 --> 52:09.700
So good and bad.

52:09.700 --> 52:12.360
So we're saying it's early days with this piece of software.

52:12.360 --> 52:14.120
It's early days still.

52:14.120 --> 52:19.520
They are funded, it seems, until February 2022, so hopefully they'll get funding again,

52:19.520 --> 52:21.840
because there's still a lot of work to do here.

52:21.840 --> 52:25.980
But this is one of those pieces of software that's truly a game changer, and if it hasn't

52:25.980 --> 52:30.000
clicked for you why this is so incredible, you probably should go try it.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.040
It's revolutionary.

52:31.040 --> 52:36.800
To be able to edit audio and video as if it was a written text document, that's next level.

52:36.800 --> 52:42.120
And to have it be free software, this is something that's worth, I think, more attention.

52:42.120 --> 52:46.120
And so even though it's very early days, we wanted to give it that attention on the show

52:46.120 --> 52:49.920
in hopes that maybe it encourages funding past February 2022.

52:49.920 --> 52:51.920
Yeah, go try it out.

52:51.920 --> 52:53.120
We'll have a link in the show notes button.

52:53.120 --> 52:57.800
If you want it spelled, it's A-U-D-A-P-O-L-I-S.

52:57.800 --> 53:01.600
I could see that being a tool we use a lot, you know, for getting clips.

53:01.600 --> 53:05.560
And we were just talking about, oh, it would have been great if we would have got a clip

53:05.560 --> 53:08.160
of some of our original Seuss criticism.

53:08.160 --> 53:09.880
Well, imagine a process like that.

53:09.880 --> 53:10.960
You got to sit there and listen through it.

53:10.960 --> 53:13.980
You got to find all of that, and which is fine, and we do it.

53:13.980 --> 53:18.000
But if we could load it up into a document and just search for the words, open Seuss

53:18.000 --> 53:22.840
a tumbleweed, and then go right to that and make a cut out of that, that's pretty great.

53:22.840 --> 53:24.960
Yeah, seems really nice for finding things.

53:24.960 --> 53:28.320
And also, I could see it maybe using it for content cleanup before you do a final pass

53:28.320 --> 53:31.720
to really dial it in, but just to remove all the extra fluff that you're going to have

53:31.720 --> 53:32.720
to cut anyway.

53:32.720 --> 53:38.440
I wonder how good it would be at transcribing all of our Linux-specific program names and

53:38.440 --> 53:39.440
such.

53:39.440 --> 53:40.440
I mean, Chris can't even do it most days.

53:40.440 --> 53:42.680
Well, there's only one way to find out.

53:42.680 --> 53:45.920
Who would fare better, Chris or the AI?

53:45.920 --> 53:48.080
We should try to find out.

53:48.080 --> 53:51.000
Yes, it is hammer time.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.200
We should get out of here.

53:52.200 --> 53:56.120
I do want to say thank you to those of you who support the show directly.

53:56.120 --> 53:58.080
I mean, you've been here since the beginning.

53:58.080 --> 54:01.240
And if this is the show that you're here for, this membership, it's not going anywhere.

54:01.240 --> 54:03.240
In fact, it's just going to get better.

54:03.240 --> 54:04.360
We'll have two options for you.

54:04.360 --> 54:08.760
You'll still have the ad-free version, which has all of the Joe production on it, or you

54:08.760 --> 54:11.480
still have the complete live version.

54:11.480 --> 54:15.440
That's available to you as well with all of our screw-ups, what we cut, and more.

54:15.440 --> 54:19.780
And thank you to the unplugged core.com members who have been there and validated this membership

54:19.780 --> 54:26.040
approach and have literally kept the show on the air for the last, I don't know, I mean,

54:26.040 --> 54:27.760
how long has it been now since we've only had just Linode?

54:27.760 --> 54:30.200
It's been a while, months.

54:30.200 --> 54:31.200
It's huge.

54:31.200 --> 54:32.480
I mean, that membership made the difference.

54:32.480 --> 54:33.680
So thank you.

54:33.680 --> 54:36.140
And it's still available at unpluggedcore.com.

54:36.140 --> 54:39.920
If you have any feedback or ideas or thoughts maybe that the show provoked within you, some

54:39.920 --> 54:43.680
feels Linuxunplugged.com slash contact, we'd love to hear that.

54:43.680 --> 54:49.040
Don't forget, we are cooking up that meetup at the beginning of the year on January 2nd.

54:49.040 --> 54:50.040
That's a Sunday.

54:50.040 --> 54:54.240
So if you're in our area or you can get out to the Pacific Northwest, we'd love to have

54:54.240 --> 54:55.240
you there.

54:55.240 --> 54:59.900
And we do have that new crypto enthusiast room as well as lots of other conversations

54:59.900 --> 55:04.760
going on in our matrix community at Linuxunplugged.com slash matrix.

55:04.760 --> 55:06.800
Man, that's a lot of stuff.

55:06.800 --> 55:08.280
I'm trying to come up with a new outro here.

55:08.280 --> 55:12.840
I admit this is a new, this is me attempting a new outro because I'm done with the Twitter

55:12.840 --> 55:13.840
plugs.

55:13.840 --> 55:15.260
I just feel done with it.

55:15.260 --> 55:18.200
I've been debating it for weeks and I'm done.

55:18.200 --> 55:19.200
So I'm trying it out.

55:19.200 --> 55:20.660
I'm trying out something different.

55:20.660 --> 55:24.400
And the problem is there's like a hundred things I would like you guys to know about

55:24.400 --> 55:27.480
because there's so much you can do and there's so many ways to interact.

55:27.480 --> 55:30.720
And if it just wasn't such a great experience, I wouldn't be mentioning all of these things.

55:30.720 --> 55:34.240
And so what ends up happening, there's like a dozen things I gotta mention and I'm still

55:34.240 --> 55:35.240
sorting it out.

55:35.240 --> 55:37.500
I tried not doing housekeeping this week.

55:37.500 --> 55:41.080
So this is what we're getting, so I apologize.

55:41.080 --> 55:44.160
I should have like some long outro that's just playing us out, I suppose.

55:44.160 --> 55:46.020
And these could just be credits at the end of the show.

55:46.020 --> 55:47.980
Consider these the show credits, I suppose.

55:47.980 --> 55:49.760
For God's sakes.

55:49.760 --> 55:53.080
Also we got a lug that happens on Sundays.

55:53.080 --> 55:54.080
I think it's good.

55:54.080 --> 55:55.620
I think it's another thing you should try.

55:55.620 --> 55:56.620
You should go.

55:56.620 --> 55:57.620
Noon Pacific.

55:57.620 --> 56:01.080
Get it in your local time at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

56:01.080 --> 56:02.720
We have details on our website.

56:02.720 --> 56:06.800
And last but not least, we'd love to have you join us live.

56:06.800 --> 56:07.800
See you next week.

56:07.800 --> 56:11.400
Same bad time, same bad station.

56:11.400 --> 56:12.400
I'm exhausted.

56:12.400 --> 56:13.400
This is too much.

56:13.400 --> 56:16.880
We gotta have less stuff at the end of the show.

56:16.880 --> 56:18.360
Some of these weeks I just want to end the show.

56:18.360 --> 56:19.360
Boom.

56:19.360 --> 56:20.360
It's done.

56:20.360 --> 56:21.360
The no outro show.

56:21.360 --> 56:22.360
Whoa.

56:22.360 --> 56:23.360
No more Tuesday.

56:23.360 --> 56:25.120
No more links.

56:25.120 --> 56:28.920
But we do have links at linuxunplug.com slash 435 for everything we talked about today

56:28.920 --> 56:30.560
if you'd like to get those.

56:30.560 --> 56:32.440
And of course we'd love to have you join us on a Tuesday.

56:32.440 --> 56:37.120
We only have a few more Live Tuesdays at Noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern at jblive.tv.

56:37.120 --> 56:41.080
All right, I can't help but tell you about these things.

56:41.080 --> 56:42.080
I love you.

56:42.080 --> 56:44.600
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

56:44.600 --> 57:11.800
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

57:14.600 --> 57:27.800
It's for people who like to mess with computers, and you know who you are, if you're somebody

57:27.800 --> 57:28.800
who doesn't want to mess with computers.

57:28.800 --> 57:29.800
I just want to surf the...

57:29.800 --> 57:34.560
I just want to buy something on Amazon, send an email to my kids, look at some websites.

57:34.560 --> 57:38.520
If that's you, you don't want to mess with it, probably not a good choice.

57:38.520 --> 57:43.880
All right, jbtitles.com, everybody go boat.

57:43.880 --> 57:46.200
I am legit a little wiped out from that.

57:46.200 --> 57:50.160
I just, you know, I made a few tweaks to the show with the housekeeping and the links.

57:50.160 --> 57:54.400
I make a few small tweaks, and now I feel like I need a nap.

57:54.400 --> 57:55.720
The whole thing went off the rails.

57:55.720 --> 57:59.200
Yeah, you don't appreciate how much of that you've just internalized over the years.

57:59.200 --> 58:05.640
Oh, I just felt like, I'm not kidding, I've been on the fence about not plugging the Twitter

58:05.640 --> 58:11.240
because I think the reality is the majority of our audience, the vast majority of our

58:11.240 --> 58:16.800
audience is not on Twitter, but there is some of them, but they're out there now.

58:16.800 --> 58:19.120
Like if they're going to get on Twitter, they've done it.

58:19.120 --> 58:21.400
And me mentioning the Twitter handle, it's pointless at this point.

58:21.400 --> 58:23.840
If people aren't following, they're not going to follow anymore.

58:23.840 --> 58:24.840
It's good.

58:24.840 --> 58:27.840
But then, you know, Jack Dorsey left Twitter and I'm like, well, why the hell am I promoting

58:27.840 --> 58:28.840
it?

58:28.840 --> 58:29.840
The damn CEO's out, right?

58:29.840 --> 58:30.840
They're like, I'm out.

58:30.840 --> 58:31.840
I'm out.

58:31.840 --> 58:32.840
I'm done.

58:32.840 --> 58:33.840
I'm done with it.

58:33.840 --> 58:34.840
I'm still on there, but I'm done promoting it.

58:34.840 --> 58:38.200
I guess if we get a, see a feedback saying, is the network on Twitter, are you guys on

58:38.200 --> 58:39.200
Twitter?

58:39.200 --> 58:40.200
We can address it then.

58:40.200 --> 58:41.200
There you go.

58:41.200 --> 58:45.080
That'll be our, that'll be our data point in the meantime, I'm just going to work it

58:45.080 --> 58:46.080
out.

58:46.080 --> 58:47.080
I'll streamline it.

58:47.080 --> 58:48.080
I'll get there.

58:48.080 --> 59:15.000
That was my first attempt and it was real bad.
