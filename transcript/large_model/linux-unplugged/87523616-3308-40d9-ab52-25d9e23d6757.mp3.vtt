WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
I'm not even sure how I came across this this week, but

00:03.200 --> 00:06.400
this might be the most adorable kernel patch ever.

00:06.400 --> 00:10.920
Now, I'm gonna read this to you, but I want you to bear in mind that the author of

00:10.920 --> 00:16.240
this kernel patch is only four years old, okay?

00:16.240 --> 00:18.760
So I know already it's adorable.

00:18.760 --> 00:21.680
I know, I can't believe, this isn't even all that recent.

00:21.680 --> 00:25.600
I think this is from 2014, but like I said, I just came across it.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.080
It is a fix for formatting.

00:28.080 --> 00:32.260
And it goes, the letter, and the last letter, which is an S, is sad.

00:32.260 --> 00:36.960
Because all of those have things like equals below them, and this one does not.

00:36.960 --> 00:41.040
This patch fixes the tragedy so all the letters can be happy again.

00:41.040 --> 00:46.160
And you read the patch notes, and it was a simple formatting fix.

00:46.160 --> 00:51.440
And one of the kernel submitters worked with the young four year old

00:51.440 --> 00:54.400
to clean things up and actually submit it into the kernel.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.800
It's so great, it's so adorable.

00:56.800 --> 01:00.720
Hopefully years later they just like find this unexpected nerd cred in their past.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.880
Like yeah, I'm a kernel committer, of course.

01:03.880 --> 01:08.000
Also I just realized how unaccomplished that makes me feel.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
I look forward to seeing Linus Torvalds reply, like shredding this four year olds patch.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.120
No, no, he was good.

01:17.120 --> 01:34.000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 276 for November 20th, 2018.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.400
Welcome to Linux Unplugged.

01:35.400 --> 01:39.440
This episode may be cursed because I realized I didn't grab myself a beverage before the

01:39.440 --> 01:40.440
show.

01:40.440 --> 01:41.440
My name is Chris.

01:41.440 --> 01:42.440
My name is Wes.

01:42.440 --> 01:43.440
Hello, Wes.

01:43.440 --> 01:47.800
So assuming we sort that tragedy out, we otherwise have a pretty great show.

01:47.800 --> 01:54.240
Coming up, we've got some community news that caught my attention this week, and we'll explain

01:54.240 --> 01:58.740
that Android kernel mystery that's probably been on your mind and you didn't even realize

01:58.740 --> 01:59.740
it.

01:59.740 --> 02:01.600
Take a look at that deep end.

02:01.600 --> 02:06.640
And then rumor has it, 1804 is going 10 years of support.

02:06.640 --> 02:12.620
We'll play the clips and a few other little highlights from Mark Shuttleworth's talk at

02:12.620 --> 02:13.620
OpenStack.

02:13.620 --> 02:14.620
Berlin, I think it was.

02:14.620 --> 02:15.620
Berlin.

02:15.620 --> 02:16.620
Berlin.

02:16.620 --> 02:17.620
You and I weren't there.

02:17.620 --> 02:18.620
But we did actually have...

02:18.620 --> 02:19.620
We've been bonding with Mark all day.

02:19.620 --> 02:22.940
We had crew members from Linux Academy at the event.

02:22.940 --> 02:23.940
Got the inside scoop.

02:23.940 --> 02:24.940
Whoa.

02:24.940 --> 02:25.940
Got the inside.

02:25.940 --> 02:28.480
They actually ended up getting stuck in Berlin too for like an extra 48 hours.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.480
It was rough.

02:29.480 --> 02:30.480
There are worse places to be.

02:30.480 --> 02:31.480
That's true.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.480
That's true.

02:32.480 --> 02:38.040
Then coming up, we will launch officially, officially the voting for our new automation

02:38.040 --> 02:39.040
system.

02:39.040 --> 02:43.260
And then we'll take in some feedback, answer some questions, give you some app pics, some

02:43.260 --> 02:50.400
gnome shell extensions, and I'll give you my first review of a Thunderbolt 3 dock that

02:50.400 --> 02:52.480
I got from my Linux box.

02:52.480 --> 02:57.480
But this one has an NVIDIA GPU built in.

02:57.480 --> 03:04.760
Can you actually add full dedicated graphics via a single cable to your Linux box?

03:04.760 --> 03:06.700
And does that crap actually work?

03:06.700 --> 03:10.040
And what are the downsides when you externalize things like that?

03:10.040 --> 03:13.240
I've got my initial report on all of that.

03:13.240 --> 03:17.640
But before we go any further, we have a solemn duty that we must perform, and that is bringing

03:17.640 --> 03:19.140
in our virtual lug.

03:19.140 --> 03:20.800
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.840
Good morning, everyone.

03:22.840 --> 03:23.840
Hello.

03:23.840 --> 03:24.840
Hello.

03:24.840 --> 03:32.120
Brandon, Brent, Charlie, Cubicle, Nate, Mini Mac, Poppy, Scott, Sean, the Silent Drifter,

03:32.120 --> 03:33.120
and Mr. Wimpy.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.880
It is good to see all of you in the virtual lug today.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.440
Really happy to have you there.

03:38.440 --> 03:41.420
You know, the virtual lug is one of the best parts of the show, so I'll just mention it

03:41.420 --> 03:42.460
right here at the top of the show.

03:42.460 --> 03:43.520
You should totally join us.

03:43.520 --> 03:48.320
We've only got a few more episodes before the end of the year, and we'll probably be

03:48.320 --> 03:53.280
recording our predictions episode either on December.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.600
It kind of depends, because Linux Unplugged really gets the shaft on the holiday schedule

03:56.600 --> 03:57.600
this year.

03:57.600 --> 04:01.720
Linux Unplugged lands on Christmas Day and New Year's Day.

04:01.720 --> 04:06.720
So we'll probably be recording our predictions episode around December 11th or the 18th.

04:06.720 --> 04:09.120
Those are like the last Tuesdays before Christmas.

04:09.120 --> 04:12.120
That's your shot to show everyone just how smart you are.

04:12.120 --> 04:15.680
Yeah, that virtual lug is open to all of you, and if you want to get a prediction on what's

04:15.680 --> 04:19.560
... I think what we're going to do, just so you can prepare yourself, is we're going to

04:19.560 --> 04:25.720
make a prediction of what we think will happen, and we're going to make a prediction of what

04:25.720 --> 04:29.920
we'd really like to see happen, what we really want to happen.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.800
Like if you had a magic wand, what would happen?

04:32.800 --> 04:33.800
Because those are always a lot of fun.

04:33.800 --> 04:37.880
We'll be doing those, and then, if all goes as planned, we'll review them a year later

04:37.880 --> 04:39.840
and see how things held up.

04:39.840 --> 04:43.760
I mean, usually that's pretty rough, but we do it anyway for consistency.

04:43.760 --> 04:44.760
That's right.

04:44.760 --> 04:45.760
That's right.

04:45.760 --> 04:46.760
So Mr. West, what have you been up to?

04:46.760 --> 04:50.960
I saw a little problem solving involving X forwarding or something that you were working

04:50.960 --> 04:51.960
on this last week.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.600
Okay, so sometimes it's a weekend and you want a game.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.480
Now by this I mean play a board game.

04:56.480 --> 05:00.040
In particular, perhaps you've played Settlers of Catan, Chris.

05:00.040 --> 05:01.040
Oh yeah.

05:01.040 --> 05:05.920
Yeah, it's a classic board game, of course, but sometimes, well, your friends just aren't

05:05.920 --> 05:07.600
where you are.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.120
Enter Pioneers.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.320
Now this isn't the fanciest game in the world.

05:11.320 --> 05:17.780
In fact, it's a pretty old GTK2 implementation, but it is free software and it implements

05:17.780 --> 05:21.200
like a whole bunch of the various expansions like Seafarers.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.520
It's not super shiny.

05:22.520 --> 05:23.520
It does work well.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.680
On Linux, like it's packaged in Debian.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.680
They have maintainers there.

05:26.680 --> 05:27.680
So it's really easy.

05:27.680 --> 05:28.680
Okay.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.360
They have some binaries that someone manages to make for Windows.

05:31.360 --> 05:32.360
Oh, really?

05:32.360 --> 05:37.240
Unfortunately, one of my friends, well, he's on a Mac and he's a political scientist.

05:37.240 --> 05:42.920
So he's not, you know, he does do some statistics in R, but compiling C++ and GTK applications.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.920
Getting a GTK2 app on Mac OS.

05:44.920 --> 05:45.920
How was that?

05:45.920 --> 05:46.920
How did that work out?

05:46.920 --> 05:47.920
Well, we dodged that bullet.

05:47.920 --> 05:49.840
In the past, I'd had him use a virtual machine.

05:49.840 --> 05:53.440
He was like, I think we used something called virtual bugs for this, which I was like, yes,

05:53.440 --> 05:54.440
okay.

05:54.440 --> 05:55.440
But I didn't want to go through that.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.640
It was already 6 p.m. on a Sunday.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.160
We just wanted to play the game.

05:58.160 --> 06:06.700
I spun up a new VPS somewhere and then I used XPRA, which bills itself as screen for X11.

06:06.700 --> 06:11.160
And it's probably most similar to X2GO, but serves similar functionality to almost any

06:11.160 --> 06:14.320
VNC or RDP type application.

06:14.320 --> 06:17.500
One of the things that makes it nice, though, is it basically starts its own little X server

06:17.500 --> 06:21.960
on the side and then you can set the display variable for any app you want to run on it.

06:21.960 --> 06:26.280
And then from any client, which includes an HTML5 client, I haven't tried it, but I'm

06:26.280 --> 06:30.240
curious on like it has a package compiled for OSX.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.520
He could just install.

06:31.520 --> 06:36.160
He ran one command on the command line and up pop the application and I used it to run

06:36.160 --> 06:37.160
the server that way.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.280
They have a nice little GTK dialogue to configure the server.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.760
So I didn't have to run that on my machine.

06:40.760 --> 06:41.980
You set up a droplet.

06:41.980 --> 06:48.520
You set this Xperia on there, XPRA, and then you forward just that GTK2 game.

06:48.520 --> 06:49.560
Yeah, exactly.

06:49.560 --> 06:53.500
And you can do it over SSH if you like, or it can bind just like a TCP port.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.840
That's pretty nice.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.320
That is interesting.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.760
So it's application level X11 forwarding.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.580
Now where does this fall in Wayland?

07:01.580 --> 07:02.580
Probably doesn't do anything at all.

07:02.580 --> 07:04.600
But for the moment, it is pretty useful.

07:04.600 --> 07:05.600
Unless you use X-Wayland.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.400
Oh, that's right.

07:07.400 --> 07:11.120
The other thing it notes here is that you have forwarding of sound, clipboard, and printing

07:11.120 --> 07:12.180
services.

07:12.180 --> 07:13.700
That's pretty nice as well.

07:13.700 --> 07:17.080
And you can do it over SSL if you like, or like Wes said, over SSH.

07:17.080 --> 07:20.120
And that HTML5 client, think about that.

07:20.120 --> 07:24.200
You could deliver single X11 applications inside a web browser with that.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.200
Yeah, right.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.200
That'd be pretty neat.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.160
I have used OBS before with this on a droplet.

07:28.160 --> 07:31.280
And of course, the video is not the snappiest.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.280
But it worked.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.240
I mean, I could control the software, and that's what counted.

07:34.240 --> 07:39.240
So did they have to install a next server on their Mac?

07:39.240 --> 07:40.240
I didn't follow along.

07:40.240 --> 07:41.260
He didn't show me his screen.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.480
But they have like a package for OSX.

07:43.480 --> 07:46.240
I just told them, hey, install this and then run that command.

07:46.240 --> 07:49.360
And with no further help or prompting from me, he got it working.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.360
I see.

07:50.360 --> 07:51.360
Yeah.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.360
Huh.

07:52.360 --> 07:53.360
And there's a Windows binary there, too.

07:53.360 --> 07:58.200
Chris, I remember you were asking for a way to watch movies and shows when you were traveling

07:58.200 --> 07:59.480
with some loved ones.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.480
Would this solve that problem?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.480
You think it could do video?

08:01.480 --> 08:02.840
I mean, I think it would transmit video.

08:02.840 --> 08:03.840
I don't know.

08:03.840 --> 08:08.180
I don't know that it's specifically optimized for that use case, so probably would be choppy.

08:08.180 --> 08:09.180
But I'll give it a shot.

08:09.180 --> 08:10.180
Yeah.

08:10.180 --> 08:11.180
Yeah.

08:11.180 --> 08:12.180
Can you post a link to it in the chat?

08:12.180 --> 08:13.180
Sure.

08:13.180 --> 08:14.180
Yeah.

08:14.180 --> 08:17.520
You can post a link to it in the show notes, linuxunplug.com.276.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.040
But we'll put it in there.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.600
It's expira.org.

08:20.600 --> 08:21.600
And it's really neat.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.120
I'm thinking about setting it up on a droplet that I use.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.960
So I have gone the other route just recently.

08:26.960 --> 08:33.180
In fact, I was talking to you about this this morning, is I've decided to set up a work

08:33.180 --> 08:38.600
environment that I can access from less capable or less set up machines.

08:38.600 --> 08:42.680
I've decided to just set up a work environment that's all on the command line as much as

08:42.680 --> 08:49.920
possible that I can SSH into from a tablet, I can SSH into it from a phone, a desktop

08:49.920 --> 08:51.700
that hasn't been set up yet.

08:51.700 --> 08:55.140
And right now, and I kind of would like some feedback from the audience since I haven't

08:55.140 --> 08:59.060
really pulled the trigger yet, I'm debating between two possibilities.

08:59.060 --> 09:05.500
Setting up a VM on a droplet that I already have, a pretty powerful droplet, or setting

09:05.500 --> 09:07.920
up an Ubuntu environment container.

09:07.920 --> 09:14.280
When you look on Docker Hub, there are Ubuntu based containers and others that are just

09:14.280 --> 09:18.480
pretty much, they're ready to go workstation container environments.

09:18.480 --> 09:19.680
And you might say, Chris, why do this?

09:19.680 --> 09:22.960
Well, my idea is, I don't want to thrash the local host.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.880
I don't want to thrash the main host system.

09:24.880 --> 09:28.920
I want to have a disposable environment that I can load packages into.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.580
I can try out different applications.

09:30.580 --> 09:35.040
I can do all kinds of things that I wouldn't want to do on a system that I want to keep

09:35.040 --> 09:36.320
around for years.

09:36.320 --> 09:40.180
And my first thought was, we'll build a VM, or anything like that.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.520
But then I thought, maybe I could do this in a container and maybe have something a

09:43.520 --> 09:44.520
little bit faster.

09:44.520 --> 09:49.720
So you combine it with this Xperia, and then I could potentially even forward web browsers.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.200
So what application do you want to run?

09:52.200 --> 09:55.520
Well for the most part, I was just thinking the command line, like YouTube, DL, things

09:55.520 --> 09:59.280
that I might want to run from the command line, do network diagnostics from a remote

09:59.280 --> 10:00.760
system, that kind of stuff.

10:00.760 --> 10:01.760
And so I initially-

10:01.760 --> 10:05.080
I should set up some things like maybe Dropbox or other syncing systems so you could talk

10:05.080 --> 10:06.080
to it.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.440
I want something like that so I could move files in and out of cloud storage.

10:08.440 --> 10:11.240
So that would definitely be a component of it.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.680
And SFTP, you know, stuff like that.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.960
So it doesn't have to be a lot.

10:14.960 --> 10:15.960
So I'm curious to know what the audience would do.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.400
Would you set up a VM or would you set up a container?

10:18.400 --> 10:20.720
And the reason why you might go containers is because maybe it'd be a little faster.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.920
I use sort of a mix of both.

10:22.920 --> 10:23.920
Oh really?

10:23.920 --> 10:24.920
Yeah.

10:24.920 --> 10:28.720
So yes, you could have your droplet, an Ubuntu droplet.

10:28.720 --> 10:34.240
And then for trying stuff out, you know, when you want to make sure it's all working nicely,

10:34.240 --> 10:42.320
what you could do is use a combination of LexD and Multipass to start up full VMs when

10:42.320 --> 10:47.360
maybe you're wanting to run something that needs its own kernel in order to, you know,

10:47.360 --> 10:48.360
function properly.

10:48.360 --> 10:53.880
And LexD, when it's something you can just jam inside a container quickly to test.

10:53.880 --> 10:57.640
And you know, if you get those things set up and they're working for you, then you can

10:57.640 --> 11:01.280
just leave them in those VMs and containers.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.360
Or you know, if you're just testing something out, then you can chuck them away when you're

11:04.360 --> 11:05.360
done.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.360
This is a job for multiple.

11:06.360 --> 11:11.320
This could be the perfect job for a Multipass.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.320
Good suggestion, Wimpy.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.320
Thank you.

11:13.320 --> 11:18.120
And I mean, LexD is, you know, very well oriented for that full system in a container approach.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.120
Yeah.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.120
Yeah.

11:20.120 --> 11:23.360
I mean, you could probably do a lot of it in the new versions of LexD.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.840
Both of those are available as snaps, by the way.

11:25.840 --> 11:26.840
Hmm.

11:26.840 --> 11:27.840
Hmm.

11:27.840 --> 11:28.840
Okay.

11:28.840 --> 11:29.840
All right.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.680
All right.

11:31.680 --> 11:32.680
Go figure, right?

11:32.680 --> 11:33.680
All right.

11:33.680 --> 11:38.860
So I woke up to this news this morning and I have to be honest, it was the last news

11:38.860 --> 11:40.400
item I expected.

11:40.400 --> 11:45.680
It appears that Valve is discontinuing the hardware Steam Link, I guess, or another way

11:45.680 --> 11:49.400
to put that maybe more accurately is they're discontinuing the Steam Link hardware, the

11:49.400 --> 11:55.280
actual box itself, the little HDMI gadget that you could connect to your TV and it would

11:55.280 --> 11:57.680
stream video games from your PC.

11:57.680 --> 12:01.760
So not the client functionality in Steam, just the cute little box.

12:01.760 --> 12:05.800
And they still are going to maintain their apps, so they're going to deliver this functionality

12:05.800 --> 12:07.860
via an app.

12:07.860 --> 12:11.060
And I was really surprised to see this for a couple of reasons.

12:11.060 --> 12:17.580
Number one, Steam has really kind of led the way with the streaming service.

12:17.580 --> 12:21.600
They were out there with the Steam Link before Google ever talked about their stream beta

12:21.600 --> 12:24.000
or Microsoft ever announced the Xbox streaming.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
I mean, they didn't beat One Live, but they were out there really early.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.760
One of the first serious attempts.

12:28.760 --> 12:34.160
And the really nice thing about Valve's approach is it's over your LAN.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.420
It is over your damn LAN.

12:36.420 --> 12:42.280
And that is just going to be a much less error prone experience when you're not having to

12:42.280 --> 12:47.760
rely on your crappy internet connection or your ISP's crappy routing or five ISPs down

12:47.760 --> 12:51.120
from your ISP's crappy routing, you're going to have a much better time.

12:51.120 --> 12:57.080
And having this go over your local ethernet, there's just no competition.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.080
No competition.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.560
It's like the full control too, right?

12:59.560 --> 13:03.820
You can build the system that runs the game, you can manage the network that it plays through,

13:03.820 --> 13:05.320
and you set up the client that you want.

13:05.320 --> 13:08.920
And I've had multiple people tell me that the Steam Link is a much better experience

13:08.920 --> 13:12.060
than the Android version of the same thing.

13:12.060 --> 13:16.600
So I was pretty surprised because it seemed to me that Valve was continuing also to invest

13:16.600 --> 13:23.040
engineering in this area as of very recently, like a couple of weeks ago, so I was shocked

13:23.040 --> 13:24.040
by this.

13:24.040 --> 13:27.320
Poby, I was talking with you about it this morning, what was your reaction when you saw

13:27.320 --> 13:28.320
the news?

13:28.320 --> 13:30.720
I can't say I'm all together surprised, to be honest.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.720
Really?

13:31.720 --> 13:32.720
Yeah.

13:32.720 --> 13:33.720
It's not had a lot of love.

13:33.720 --> 13:39.680
I mean, I actually predicted that they would make a 4K version of it, but that obviously

13:39.680 --> 13:40.680
didn't come to pass.

13:40.680 --> 13:45.640
So the fact that there was never a 2.0 made me think this thing's end of life, they're

13:45.640 --> 13:46.640
not going to make it anymore.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.640
So I'm not enticed by it.

13:47.640 --> 13:53.680
I'm a little sad because actually the Android app is rubbish, and it's way better on a big

13:53.680 --> 13:55.640
TV.

13:55.640 --> 14:00.320
I use them all the time when the kids want to play a game together with me.

14:00.320 --> 14:04.480
It's one of those really nice family experiences to sit around in front of the telly, and each

14:04.480 --> 14:09.940
have a Steam controller, and we play Gang Beasts or Tower Fall or Ultimate Chicken Horse

14:09.940 --> 14:17.960
games that we play that are multiplayer local, and the gaming PC is in a completely different

14:17.960 --> 14:18.960
room in the house.

14:18.960 --> 14:23.120
It's upstairs out the way, and we just connect to it over the network, and away we go.

14:23.120 --> 14:27.960
And even when the kids have sleepovers with friends come over, they all play Gang Beasts

14:27.960 --> 14:32.240
or whatever and punch the what's-its-out-of-each-other, and it's great.

14:32.240 --> 14:36.440
So yeah, I'm glad I've got them, and I'm keeping them, and you can prize them from my cold

14:36.440 --> 14:37.440
dead hands.

14:37.440 --> 14:38.440
Right.

14:38.440 --> 14:40.640
And it does say they're going to continue to support them for a while.

14:40.640 --> 14:44.600
Wimpy, I'm curious to know if you think it's just simply people weren't willing to hook

14:44.600 --> 14:46.600
up a dedicated hardware box to their TV.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.400
They've got enough set-top boxes now.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.960
Yeah, I mean, there could be some fatigue around that.

14:50.960 --> 14:54.080
I've got three set-top boxes downstairs now.

14:54.080 --> 14:57.480
I've got a Roku, an Nvidia Shield, and a Steam Link.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.800
I feel a little bit aggrieved because the Steam Link is the most recent addition.

15:00.800 --> 15:07.500
I got that in the sales just a couple of months ago, but hopefully there'll be some longevity

15:07.500 --> 15:11.600
to the device because the functionality will be the same as whatever the software solution

15:11.600 --> 15:13.080
is that replaces it.

15:13.080 --> 15:17.000
Yeah, and it was, I think in a way, it's a bit ahead of its time.

15:17.000 --> 15:23.620
I think you may see once streaming services become more mainstream and people recognize

15:23.620 --> 15:28.960
some of the limitations, there may be consumer interest in a solution that avoids those bottlenecks

15:28.960 --> 15:31.120
and those limitations, and the Steam Link would be that.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.120
But it would be.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.120
I don't know.

15:33.120 --> 15:36.560
Maybe this will be a refocusing point because, I mean, they could still maintain market share

15:36.560 --> 15:40.640
or mine share if the Android app wasn't crap, or if it integrated with more third-party

15:40.640 --> 15:41.880
services in a better way.

15:41.880 --> 15:42.880
Yeah, I mean...

15:42.880 --> 15:46.920
Because they're not going to win the be the end device battle, but they could win the

15:46.920 --> 15:48.380
were the game marketplace still.

15:48.380 --> 15:53.680
So I'm pretty sure the Nvidia Shield's GeForce streaming gaming stuff is very similar in

15:53.680 --> 15:59.840
nature to the Shield's, or I'm sorry, to the Steam stream stuff, and there's not a latency

15:59.840 --> 16:04.160
or lag issue with the Nvidia Shield GeForce stream service.

16:04.160 --> 16:07.920
So it must be doable on Android because the GeForce one's fine.

16:07.920 --> 16:11.240
Brandon, you mentioned in the chat room that you've had a Steam Link for a while.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.000
What's your sort of quick review of the device?

16:13.000 --> 16:16.240
It seems like it was a solid product to me, but I had limited experience with it.

16:16.240 --> 16:22.920
Well, I thought it was fine, and it was also, like, I could play a few games on it.

16:22.920 --> 16:28.320
What I also liked about it is if I wanted to project something on the TV, like, you

16:28.320 --> 16:34.720
could actually do something like, what does Apple call it, the AirPlay, you can actually

16:34.720 --> 16:39.080
do something like display or desktop on the screen if you hack it right.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.920
Yes, that's right.

16:40.920 --> 16:41.920
That is so cool.

16:41.920 --> 16:44.160
As a geek, that is just the best.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.160
All right.

16:45.160 --> 16:46.160
Well, okay.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.880
Well, then we'll take a moment.

16:48.880 --> 16:53.600
We take a moment and we say goodbye to the Steam Link hardware, and my first thought

16:53.600 --> 16:54.600
was maybe I should buy one.

16:54.600 --> 16:55.600
Yeah, right?

16:55.600 --> 16:58.240
I actually have one already, though, so I'm good, I'm good.

16:58.240 --> 17:04.680
I wanted to highlight an article over at LWN that talked about mainlining the Android kernel

17:04.680 --> 17:09.260
contributions, and as everybody knows, Android devices are based on the Linux kernel.

17:09.260 --> 17:12.200
Those devices, though, don't really run a mainline kernel.

17:12.200 --> 17:16.260
There's a good amount of out-of-tree code shipping on those devices, and that often

17:16.260 --> 17:17.260
causes problems.

17:17.260 --> 17:24.320
In 2008, I'm sorry, in the 2018 Linux Plumber's Conference, which just wrapped up, there was

17:24.320 --> 17:31.220
specific discussions around fixing this, and maybe even running mainline kernels on Android

17:31.220 --> 17:33.160
devices one day.

17:33.160 --> 17:38.640
We're definitely not there yet, but it may be closer than most people think it is.

17:38.640 --> 17:39.640
It is complicated, though, right?

17:39.640 --> 17:45.920
Because it starts with this LTS release from the mainline, then that's combined with core

17:45.920 --> 17:51.780
Android-specific code to make what's called the Android Common Kernel release, then vendors

17:51.780 --> 17:56.640
pick up that Common Kernel, add a bunch more out-of-tree code to create a kernel specific

17:56.640 --> 18:00.680
to a system on a chip, and then ship that to actual device manufacturers.

18:00.680 --> 18:04.000
Yeah, and then they end up with this, like, essentially a device kernel.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.180
So you have the mainline kernel, which becomes the Android Common Kernel, which then becomes

18:09.180 --> 18:11.480
essentially a device kernel.

18:11.480 --> 18:17.920
That is really complicated, and the Android core has really kind of been slow because

18:17.920 --> 18:18.920
of this.

18:18.920 --> 18:23.560
And in this development process, it's meant being based on really old kernels.

18:23.560 --> 18:27.960
And it takes, really all told, a lot of the advantages out of basing all of this on Linux,

18:27.960 --> 18:28.960
if you think about it.

18:28.960 --> 18:29.960
Yeah, you have all these...

18:29.960 --> 18:33.720
I mean, the biggest problem, I think, has been that you don't have a lot of abstraction

18:33.720 --> 18:34.720
between them.

18:34.720 --> 18:35.960
Like, people are just modifying the kernel.

18:35.960 --> 18:41.120
So when big upstream changes come from the kernel, all this random out-of-tree code that

18:41.120 --> 18:44.360
no one else can see, that's just gonna break.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.360
Yeah.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.960
Now, the word at this Plumber's Conference, though, is that Google plans to continue to

18:47.960 --> 18:54.560
push vendors to ship updates, eventually mandating updates to newer LTS releases even after a

18:54.560 --> 18:56.300
device is launched.

18:56.300 --> 19:01.560
At some point, LTS releases will be included at Android security boltons because there

19:01.560 --> 19:05.480
really is value in getting all that info out there and getting the bug fixes upstream.

19:05.480 --> 19:09.800
Now, really the problem of getting devices around mainline kernels, of course, is all

19:09.800 --> 19:12.520
of that out-of-tree code that the device manufacturers add.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.320
That's really where the issue is.

19:14.320 --> 19:19.200
The amount of code in the Android common kernel has been reduced considerably, though, with

19:19.200 --> 19:22.520
a focused effort on getting these changes back upstream.

19:22.520 --> 19:29.600
And there are now only about 30 patches in the Android common kernel, adding about 6,500

19:29.600 --> 19:32.640
lines of code that are needed to boot Android.

19:32.640 --> 19:36.520
Eventually though, they hope to get that down to zero once they can bring in a few things.

19:36.520 --> 19:40.320
Some of those, though, are kind of exciting, like getting energy-aware scheduling into

19:40.320 --> 19:41.320
the mainline.

19:41.320 --> 19:42.320
Yeah.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.320
Yeah.

19:43.320 --> 19:50.560
And part of this is Google is going to knock off all that behavior of OEMs building in

19:50.560 --> 19:54.640
their own schedulers and replacing the mainline scheduler because then sometimes you get wonky

19:54.640 --> 19:58.520
results with apps that are really hard for developers to test against.

19:58.520 --> 20:01.140
And you're probably thinking, as we're reading all of this, you're probably thinking about

20:01.140 --> 20:02.140
Project Treble.

20:02.140 --> 20:03.140
I know I was.

20:03.140 --> 20:04.140
Yeah.

20:04.140 --> 20:05.140
Right?

20:05.140 --> 20:07.260
That introduced that new vendor interface, an API that implements a sort of hardware

20:07.260 --> 20:14.440
abstraction layer, along with this interface came the concept of a generic system image,

20:14.440 --> 20:18.040
which you'll hear Android developers refer to as a GSI.

20:18.040 --> 20:22.680
If the GSI can be booted on a specific device, then the manufacturer has implemented the

20:22.680 --> 20:28.920
vendor interface correctly, i.e. one of the tests is booting this standard image on your

20:28.920 --> 20:29.920
device.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.960
If you fail, then you're not matching the standard.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.880
Now, so here's where it gets better.

20:33.880 --> 20:37.580
Right now, the kernel is considered to be part of that vendor interface, right?

20:37.580 --> 20:41.680
So the vendor must provide it as part of the low-level implementation.

20:41.680 --> 20:47.420
But the plan, and this is the big change, is for Android to provide that generic kernel.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.720
Devices will be expected to run this kernel.

20:49.720 --> 20:53.740
To make that happen, they have to provide a set of kernel modules, and that's where

20:53.740 --> 20:55.000
that new boundary comes in.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.920
They can no longer provide their whole custom kernel, just a module, and that makes it a

20:59.920 --> 21:00.920
lot easier to interrupt.

21:00.920 --> 21:01.920
Yeah.

21:01.920 --> 21:05.680
So they're moving all of that out of the main kernel itself, putting it into a module, and

21:05.680 --> 21:10.800
that would, I wonder, hopefully mean, down the road, damn close to mainline kernels,

21:10.800 --> 21:12.520
which means much faster security updates.

21:12.520 --> 21:15.680
Like, okay, vendors add a couple of their own modules to support their hardware.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.520
That is a lot more reasonable.

21:17.520 --> 21:18.520
It's really how it should be done.

21:18.520 --> 21:19.520
Yeah, right?

21:19.520 --> 21:20.520
Yeah.

21:20.520 --> 21:27.040
I do kind of, in the back of my mind, wonder if this is the fallout and result of Spectre

21:27.040 --> 21:29.600
and Meltdown, in a way.

21:29.600 --> 21:35.480
Being able to respond to those types of vulnerabilities across an entire platform really became a

21:35.480 --> 21:38.640
thing at the beginning of this year that a lot of vendors became aware of.

21:38.640 --> 21:44.440
Like, the concept that shit, we have shipped something that is faulty by design, and we

21:44.440 --> 21:49.320
have to retroactively patch these internet connected devices, and we don't have a standard

21:49.320 --> 21:50.400
mechanism to do that.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.840
There's no continuous integration.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.920
There's no pipeline to get this stuff built.

21:53.920 --> 21:54.920
It takes years.

21:54.920 --> 21:55.920
They're working on those tools.

21:55.920 --> 22:00.200
They go into some detail on their continuous integration pipeline in the LWN article, if

22:00.200 --> 22:02.400
you want to read more.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.400
It's a ways off.

22:03.400 --> 22:11.440
What's interesting is when they very, very begin the process of taking the mainline kernel,

22:11.440 --> 22:13.400
they're really kind of just a few weeks off.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.920
When they start working on it, they're just a few weeks off from mainstream.

22:16.920 --> 22:21.880
It doesn't transition to years late until it goes through that device manufacture phase

22:21.880 --> 22:24.280
where they customize the kernel for their hardware.

22:24.280 --> 22:27.880
So making that into a module could make a huge difference for Android.

22:27.880 --> 22:28.880
Okay.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.960
So there's also one other question that just comes to my mind.

22:30.960 --> 22:32.720
This is a lot of work from Google.

22:32.720 --> 22:35.740
Like they're putting a significant pressure on those kernel releases, changing the way

22:35.740 --> 22:36.740
this is done.

22:36.740 --> 22:38.640
How does that fit in with their Fuchsia play?

22:38.640 --> 22:41.080
I was just thinking the same thing.

22:41.080 --> 22:43.640
I was thinking that all through this discussion.

22:43.640 --> 22:44.640
Yeah.

22:44.640 --> 22:45.640
So what do you think Wimpy?

22:45.640 --> 22:46.640
What is the play here?

22:46.640 --> 22:51.360
Why invest all this time, make multi-year plans just to pull the rug out from underneath

22:51.360 --> 22:52.760
it all and introduce Fuchsia?

22:52.760 --> 22:58.480
Well, that's been people's reading of Fuchsia and Magenta right now, and maybe we've read

22:58.480 --> 22:59.480
it wrong.

22:59.480 --> 23:00.520
Maybe that isn't the intention.

23:00.520 --> 23:03.580
Maybe Android's safe and it's not going to get replaced.

23:03.580 --> 23:06.960
The other idea maybe is that they're trying to prepare OEMs and manufacturers for this

23:06.960 --> 23:07.960
relationship.

23:07.960 --> 23:11.040
Like, look, on our next operating system that we want you to ship, they're getting updates.

23:11.040 --> 23:12.040
You have to plan for it.

23:12.040 --> 23:13.440
Now my glass is half empty, Wes.

23:13.440 --> 23:14.440
Thank you.

23:14.440 --> 23:15.920
My pleasure, sir.

23:15.920 --> 23:16.920
It really could be.

23:16.920 --> 23:17.920
It could be that.

23:17.920 --> 23:25.160
It also could be the fact that even once they start shipping Fuchsia, that there will be

23:25.160 --> 23:26.640
years still of a market dominating.

23:26.640 --> 23:27.640
It has to be, right?

23:27.640 --> 23:29.200
I mean, there's billions of Android devices now.

23:29.200 --> 23:34.080
So this is something that needs fixing regardless.

23:34.080 --> 23:38.040
And I am one that thinks that Fuchsia is designed to replace Android.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.580
I admit it.

23:39.580 --> 23:44.360
And I have not much to go on other than what it can do, the way it's built, and the fact

23:44.360 --> 23:48.000
that their most recent products didn't ship with Android, but they shipped on the Chromecast

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
platform.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.480
That, to me, is a big indicator that Android isn't a hot product inside.

23:52.480 --> 23:53.480
I don't know.

23:53.480 --> 23:54.480
We'll see.

23:54.480 --> 23:58.600
I hope I'm wrong because I had a recent go with the Pixel 3.

23:58.600 --> 24:04.280
And some memory issues aside, I think Android P is pretty damn good, especially put in that

24:04.280 --> 24:05.280
dark mode.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.280
Did you get a chance to update your device?

24:07.280 --> 24:08.280
I did.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.280
And honestly, P is great.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.280
It's snappy.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.280
It's a lot faster.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.280
It's smooth.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.040
The notification management stuff's way better.

24:14.040 --> 24:16.120
It's nice to be able to just shut that stuff up.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.880
And then one of the other things, it'll come up and say, hey, bro, I've noticed that you

24:18.880 --> 24:20.560
commonly dismiss this notification.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.560
Do you want me to stop?

24:21.560 --> 24:23.200
Do you want me to just turn it off?

24:23.200 --> 24:25.440
And I'm like, yeah, I do.

24:25.440 --> 24:26.440
Thank you.

24:26.440 --> 24:27.440
Yeah, that is good.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.520
And also, the settings menu is really great now as well.

24:29.520 --> 24:30.720
Yeah, much better.

24:30.720 --> 24:31.720
Much better.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.280
So I kind of hope they stick with it in some ways.

24:33.280 --> 24:37.620
I don't want to see them bail on it because we haven't gotten to that perfect...

24:37.620 --> 24:42.720
That perfect Android device is that DEX concept that everybody's excited about right now.

24:42.720 --> 24:44.260
That's the perfect Android device.

24:44.260 --> 24:48.180
You have a USB-C interface or something like that that you plug into a monitor.

24:48.180 --> 24:50.680
You get mouse and keyboard, everything.

24:50.680 --> 24:52.480
You have a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard.

24:52.480 --> 24:53.480
You sit down at your desk.

24:53.480 --> 24:54.480
You plug in one cable.

24:54.480 --> 24:55.480
You get power.

24:55.480 --> 24:56.520
You get external display.

24:56.520 --> 24:59.720
And you have a full desktop environment running on this Android device.

24:59.720 --> 25:00.720
That is...

25:00.720 --> 25:02.220
I still think that's possible.

25:02.220 --> 25:04.400
And I think the interest in the new DEX system...

25:04.400 --> 25:08.400
I mean, you could also see tablet hybrids, which was a case you shove your phone inside

25:08.400 --> 25:11.560
and then that mode activates into a hybrid tablet mode.

25:11.560 --> 25:12.560
Cool.

25:12.560 --> 25:13.560
That'd be pretty good.

25:13.560 --> 25:14.560
That'd be pretty good.

25:14.560 --> 25:15.560
All right.

25:15.560 --> 25:17.240
Well, let's do a little community news here.

25:17.240 --> 25:19.560
Deepin has a release, 15.8.

25:19.560 --> 25:23.000
The latest version of the Deepin Linux distribution is out and available for download.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.120
I gave it a download today.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.700
Man, their mirror is getting hammered.

25:26.700 --> 25:28.560
So I downloaded...

25:28.560 --> 25:30.080
They had one option to download it off Google Drive.

25:30.080 --> 25:32.600
I did that and that went a little bit faster.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.600
This I'll say right off the top didn't boot for us.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.600
I mean, actually it booted.

25:36.600 --> 25:37.600
It didn't install for us.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.100
It would not install on our MV&E storage.

25:40.100 --> 25:41.660
I don't know what was going on.

25:41.660 --> 25:47.040
We only had a little bit to play with it, but really pretty, really, really pretty.

25:47.040 --> 25:50.100
It adapts to different display resolutions really well.

25:50.100 --> 25:54.880
They've added an auto brightness function, which is, I think, all of the rage and should

25:54.880 --> 25:58.360
be mandatory on today's 2018 desktop.

25:58.360 --> 26:00.320
And they have a great doc system.

26:00.320 --> 26:05.480
Deepin is one of those, I don't know, right now it feels like it's maybe not getting the

26:05.480 --> 26:06.520
respect it should.

26:06.520 --> 26:08.260
It's really a unique take.

26:08.260 --> 26:12.720
I'm not saying it's like an elementary OS, but it's in that category.

26:12.720 --> 26:15.720
It has worked hard to carve out its own little niche out there.

26:15.720 --> 26:17.280
It's an elegant distribution, right?

26:17.280 --> 26:18.280
Yes.

26:18.280 --> 26:19.280
Yeah.

26:19.280 --> 26:20.280
It's not for everyone and it won't meet all of your needs.

26:20.280 --> 26:21.280
Right?

26:21.280 --> 26:22.400
We couldn't get it to install.

26:22.400 --> 26:25.640
The installer is not super full featured, but it was really elegant.

26:25.640 --> 26:28.920
And if it had worked seamlessly, it would have been a really good experience.

26:28.920 --> 26:32.880
Do you know if they ended up fixing the issue that they had in the previous release where

26:32.880 --> 26:36.960
some of their native applications are not the same as other ones?

26:36.960 --> 26:39.520
I kind of vaguely recall what you're talking about.

26:39.520 --> 26:43.560
Does anybody else in the Mumba room recall what he's talking about and have a recollection

26:43.560 --> 26:44.560
there?

26:44.560 --> 26:45.880
That sounds vaguely familiar.

26:45.880 --> 26:51.540
So in particular, if you go into the settings menu, you open up certain settings applications.

26:51.540 --> 26:54.520
And if you've got the dark theme on, it'll be the dark theme.

26:54.520 --> 26:58.360
But then other ones, it will only be white and you don't have an option to change it.

26:58.360 --> 26:59.360
Okay.

26:59.360 --> 27:00.360
Okay.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.400
That might have been something I would have had a chance to try had it installed.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.400
Yeah.

27:03.400 --> 27:04.400
I don't quite understand why it didn't install.

27:04.400 --> 27:09.800
We were doing a full disclosure on a core boot system and I did see some weird grub

27:09.800 --> 27:10.800
install errors.

27:10.800 --> 27:11.800
So who knows?

27:11.800 --> 27:12.800
Yeah.

27:12.800 --> 27:13.800
It could have been the core boot thing.

27:13.800 --> 27:14.800
But I don't know.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.360
I don't have a lot of experience with this distribution.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.480
Nobody in the Mumba room is speaking up about it.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.480
So I guess nobody.

27:19.480 --> 27:20.480
Yeah.

27:20.480 --> 27:21.880
I've used it quite a bit recently.

27:21.880 --> 27:22.880
Oh, really?

27:22.880 --> 27:23.880
You have?

27:23.880 --> 27:24.880
I have.

27:24.880 --> 27:25.880
Yeah.

27:25.880 --> 27:28.080
It's one of my go-to distros for doing distro testing.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.080
Yeah.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.080
I love it.

27:30.080 --> 27:31.080
I think it's brilliant.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.080
Okay.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.080
Why is it your go-to?

27:33.080 --> 27:34.080
And what do you like about it so much?

27:34.080 --> 27:39.320
It's my go-to because we're testing stuff that is not on Ubuntu and is not necessarily

27:39.320 --> 27:44.720
Debian because it's built from Debian unstable in a similar way that Ubuntu is.

27:44.720 --> 27:45.720
Right.

27:45.720 --> 27:51.520
So it's a good sort of halfway house for testing stuff, but also it's just so nice and I actually

27:51.520 --> 27:52.760
enjoy using it.

27:52.760 --> 27:54.640
I think, oh, yes.

27:54.640 --> 28:00.880
Every time I boot up Deepin, I just think this is really lovely and thoughtfully presented

28:00.880 --> 28:08.160
and elegant and pretty and modern and it's just everything about it I think is just really

28:08.160 --> 28:09.160
on point.

28:09.160 --> 28:11.200
I think it's terrific.

28:11.200 --> 28:14.840
One thing we noticed when we were going through the installer was the end-user license agreement.

28:14.840 --> 28:17.720
What do you think about that?

28:17.720 --> 28:18.720
I'll be honest.

28:18.720 --> 28:19.720
I haven't read that.

28:19.720 --> 28:20.720
I mean, we didn't either.

28:20.720 --> 28:22.960
You just got to scroll down, but we didn't read it.

28:22.960 --> 28:27.400
You don't often see like a full screen EULA when you're installing Linux though.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.400
Yeah.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.400
It's its own unique thing though.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.400
Its own unique installer.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.400
It's very pretty.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.880
It's very minimal as well from what I remember.

28:33.880 --> 28:34.880
Yeah.

28:34.880 --> 28:35.880
Yeah.

28:35.880 --> 28:36.880
All right.

28:36.880 --> 28:37.880
Okay.

28:37.880 --> 28:38.880
I'll give it a go on an Encore boot system.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.640
I mean, I'll take that installer even with it not working over Anaconda any day.

28:40.640 --> 28:41.640
Yeah, that's true.

28:41.640 --> 28:44.280
Why is it not a fan of Anaconda?

28:44.280 --> 28:45.840
Which I've turned on it over the years.

28:45.840 --> 28:47.880
I've liked it a little bit more.

28:47.880 --> 28:52.880
So package availability, snaps, those things, how's that on Deepin, Wimpy?

28:52.880 --> 28:53.920
It's all tickety-boo.

28:53.920 --> 28:54.920
It works really well there.

28:54.920 --> 28:55.920
Oh, very good.

28:55.920 --> 28:56.920
Okay.

28:56.920 --> 28:57.920
All right.

28:57.920 --> 28:58.920
It's on the we'll try list.

28:58.920 --> 28:59.920
We'll try it on a different laptop.

28:59.920 --> 29:00.920
Yeah.

29:00.920 --> 29:05.600
You know, the thing is, is I really wanted that core boot machine, which is a Purism,

29:05.600 --> 29:06.600
by the way.

29:06.600 --> 29:07.600
It's the Librem 15.

29:07.600 --> 29:11.160
I really want, I like that to be my go-to distro tester.

29:11.160 --> 29:15.400
That's really like the, but core boot sometimes does throw things for a loop, which always

29:15.400 --> 29:16.400
surprises me.

29:16.400 --> 29:19.560
Like it seems like if any operating system was going to have solid core boot support.

29:19.560 --> 29:20.560
It would be.

29:20.560 --> 29:21.560
It would be Linux.

29:21.560 --> 29:22.560
Come on.

29:22.560 --> 29:23.560
But it's just not, you know, it's not a priority for that distro.

29:23.560 --> 29:29.560
So it's understandable and it doesn't really properly reflect actual consumer hardware.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.560
Right.

29:30.560 --> 29:34.160
In one ways it's great because it's this like free hardware sort of thing, but no one else

29:34.160 --> 29:35.160
runs it.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.160
Yeah.

29:36.160 --> 29:40.440
This is the beginning of the process where Chris justifies yet another studio computer.

29:40.440 --> 29:41.440
Just kidding.

29:41.440 --> 29:42.440
Never enough.

29:42.440 --> 29:46.320
You know, maybe I'll keep them around now that I know that these 1804 installs are going

29:46.320 --> 29:49.120
to get 10 years of support.

29:49.120 --> 29:53.120
Well, there's some, there's some details along with that, but this was an interesting announcement

29:53.120 --> 29:55.200
in several ways, actually.

29:55.200 --> 29:59.880
Mark Shuttleworth, of course, the founder of Canonical was at the OpenStack Summit in

29:59.880 --> 30:00.880
Berlin.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.520
Mr. Wimby, I think you were there as well, weren't you?

30:02.520 --> 30:04.400
No, I wasn't in Berlin as it happens.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.400
I was in Stuttgart.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.800
Oh, oh, I would barely even know the difference.

30:07.800 --> 30:08.800
So I'm sorry.

30:08.800 --> 30:09.800
Yeah.

30:09.800 --> 30:16.720
So, uh, yeah, I, um, I, uh, was with a team of colleagues in Stuttgart, including Mark,

30:16.720 --> 30:19.160
um, at the back end of last week.

30:19.160 --> 30:24.580
And the OpenStack Summit seems like, um, like it's Mark Shuttleworth's power zone.

30:24.580 --> 30:30.240
Like he really knows that market, uh, I don't know when I watched him up on stage, I thought

30:30.240 --> 30:33.960
this guy really knows how to speak to this audience and he knows specifically what's

30:33.960 --> 30:34.960
important to them.

30:34.960 --> 30:35.960
I'll give you a little flavor.

30:35.960 --> 30:39.720
So I grabbed a couple of clips so you guys can get a taste of what, what an OpenStack

30:39.720 --> 30:46.480
keynote by Mark Shuttleworth is like, and this is the very beginning here.

30:46.480 --> 30:47.740
Good morning, everybody.

30:47.740 --> 30:53.180
It was so great yesterday to see everybody from this community again.

30:53.180 --> 30:59.360
Every six months we meet up, uh, but I was stopped a thousand times by people with the

30:59.360 --> 31:00.880
same two questions.

31:00.880 --> 31:03.640
So I thought I may as well just answer them here.

31:03.640 --> 31:09.280
Now he, uh, he's about to make a joke, but before he makes the joke, he actually addresses

31:09.280 --> 31:13.920
what his thoughts are on the IBM buying Red Hat story, which I thought was pretty bold

31:13.920 --> 31:18.440
move up on the stage, especially since that's a player in that market, you know, I mean,

31:18.440 --> 31:19.440
they're competitors.

31:19.440 --> 31:26.840
Um, the first question, uh, since everybody sees Canonical and Ubuntu as the company that's

31:26.840 --> 31:38.240
risen to challenge Red Hat in the enterprise, it's what do I think of IBM buying Red Hat?

31:38.240 --> 31:43.080
There's two big burly Texans behind the curtain.

31:43.080 --> 31:48.880
So let me say I wasn't surprised to see Red Hat sell, uh, because over the last two years

31:48.880 --> 31:54.120
I've seen some of their largest users and customers opening up and saying they wanted

31:54.120 --> 32:00.560
to have new Linux options, uh, and signing up to build open infrastructure with Ubuntu.

32:00.560 --> 32:08.040
But I was surprised at the amount of debt that IBM took on, uh, to close the deal.

32:08.040 --> 32:13.500
And I would be worried for IBM, uh, except the public cloud is a huge opportunity.

32:13.500 --> 32:19.440
And I guess it makes sense if you think of IBM being able to steer a large amount of

32:19.440 --> 32:26.200
on-prem rail workloads to the IBM cloud, then that deal might make sense.

32:26.200 --> 32:30.260
I was both, uh, cutting and astute, right?

32:30.260 --> 32:33.640
It's like, I think that's great and brave of him.

32:33.640 --> 32:38.080
He then goes on to joke that the second most common question that he gets is, uh, who did

32:38.080 --> 32:42.920
you lose a bet with to have to glow, to grow out that, uh, I think as he puts it glorious

32:42.920 --> 32:45.560
beard, I think are magnificent or something like that.

32:45.560 --> 32:48.160
He really is rocking a beard these days.

32:48.160 --> 32:49.680
Have you seen a recent latest look?

32:49.680 --> 32:50.680
Yeah.

32:50.680 --> 32:51.680
Have you seen a picture of Mark Shuttleworth?

32:51.680 --> 32:55.240
It is funny because none of the like stock photos used in like quotes of him around the

32:55.240 --> 32:57.280
various news sites have updated at all.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.280
No.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.600
Well, it's, it was a lot of beard.

32:59.600 --> 33:03.880
I mean, if for, in ratio to Mark's public appearance, it was a lot of beard in a short

33:03.880 --> 33:04.880
period of time.

33:04.880 --> 33:11.920
Um, so while he's up on stage though, he's, he's gotten really good at doing a keynote

33:11.920 --> 33:13.480
in like 10 minutes.

33:13.480 --> 33:16.560
And when you're doing a keynote in 10 minutes, you really got to get going and you got to

33:16.560 --> 33:17.560
explain stuff.

33:17.560 --> 33:20.840
I mean, you got to have all, all the terms and the jargon you got to get through.

33:20.840 --> 33:22.540
You have to have a clip.

33:22.540 --> 33:28.360
And so Mark's going through and he's identifying what is a new area of growth for canonical.

33:28.360 --> 33:33.520
And in this, he just casually drops in there that Ubuntu 18.04 will just receive 10 years

33:33.520 --> 33:35.480
of support instead of the five we all expected.

33:35.480 --> 33:39.100
A couple of years ago, we started focusing on telcos and I think everybody knows that

33:39.100 --> 33:43.360
Ubuntu is the platform, uh, for telco open stack.

33:43.360 --> 33:48.560
Um, last year we said we were focused on adding financial services to that.

33:48.560 --> 33:53.940
And I'm very excited to tell you that over that period, six of the world's top 20 banks

33:53.940 --> 33:57.840
have signed up with canonical to build open infrastructure on Ubuntu.

33:57.840 --> 33:59.740
Now let's actually think about that.

33:59.740 --> 34:01.400
Six of the world's top 20 banks.

34:01.400 --> 34:04.000
Now you say, okay, six out of 20 doesn't seem like a lot.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.620
Well, that has to be out of those 20 people that are interested in doing an open stack

34:07.620 --> 34:09.520
deployment to begin with.

34:09.520 --> 34:12.320
So that narrows down the list, right?

34:12.320 --> 34:16.160
And also like each one of those deployments, it's a sizable deployment.

34:16.160 --> 34:17.160
Yeah.

34:17.160 --> 34:18.160
Oh yeah.

34:18.160 --> 34:19.160
All six of them are going to be huge.

34:19.160 --> 34:20.160
Right?

34:20.160 --> 34:23.920
But only not, you don't, you don't just assume that all 20 just were itching to go to open

34:23.920 --> 34:24.920
stack.

34:24.920 --> 34:28.000
So only some of them were looking to switch their core infrastructure to begin with.

34:28.000 --> 34:32.260
And the ones that did, six of them went with canonical solution.

34:32.260 --> 34:33.640
That's a pretty major win.

34:33.640 --> 34:37.600
But as somebody who has worked in the financial institution for nearly a decade back in the

34:37.600 --> 34:40.880
day, I can tell you they move at a different pace.

34:40.880 --> 34:48.080
As we moved into these new industries, that really raises the bar and the complexity and

34:48.080 --> 34:50.960
the diversity of things that we support.

34:50.960 --> 34:54.680
For those of you who are grappling with GDPR, you'll be delighted to know that the current

34:54.680 --> 35:00.560
release of Ubuntu open stack supports full disk encryption, bastion and uses vault for

35:00.560 --> 35:02.380
key storage.

35:02.380 --> 35:11.080
I'm also delighted to announce that Ubuntu 18.04 will be supported for a full 10 years

35:11.080 --> 35:15.760
in part because of the very long time horizons in some of those industries, financial services

35:15.760 --> 35:20.800
and telecommunications, but also from IOT where manufacturing lines, for example, are

35:20.800 --> 35:24.940
being deployed that will be in production for at least a decade.

35:24.940 --> 35:29.540
Ten years now that's part of their ESM program, which I'm pretty sure when I looked on the

35:29.540 --> 35:34.240
website has a $2,500 minimum to join, which means you probably have to have $2,500 worth

35:34.240 --> 35:35.320
of machines.

35:35.320 --> 35:36.320
Which makes sense, right?

35:36.320 --> 35:40.200
I mean, we're used to thinking about Ubuntu solely in the open source or the cloud side,

35:40.200 --> 35:41.200
the unsupported side.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.200
Yeah, right.

35:42.200 --> 35:44.720
But like the market they're talking about here, the market Mark's talking about, the

35:44.720 --> 35:48.680
market that people investing and considering these things are talking about is enterprise

35:48.680 --> 35:49.680
support.

35:49.680 --> 35:54.840
Yeah, they have a fleet of Ubuntu systems and meeting that $2,500 minimum is easy.

35:54.840 --> 35:56.240
That's where it's kind of interesting too, right?

35:56.240 --> 36:00.680
Because you think about banks or especially telcos where you have these new breed of internet

36:00.680 --> 36:02.320
companies that roll out their own, right?

36:02.320 --> 36:05.800
They're like, we'll take your software, we'll hire a bunch of highly paid engineers in San

36:05.800 --> 36:08.100
Francisco and they'll build our systems.

36:08.100 --> 36:09.240
But not everyone wants that.

36:09.240 --> 36:11.360
Telcos have their own technology to build.

36:11.360 --> 36:14.160
So that's where they need a partner who can provide support for the layers they're not

36:14.160 --> 36:15.160
interested in.

36:15.160 --> 36:19.880
And there's a market reality here too, where if you're shipping a product in 2020, 2021,

36:19.880 --> 36:23.160
then you're just starting to build it now.

36:23.160 --> 36:27.560
And you want to base it on an operating system that's still going to have valid support when

36:27.560 --> 36:29.760
your product actually makes it to the market and ships.

36:29.760 --> 36:33.680
Yeah, you don't care about all the glibc changes that might happen in four years down the road

36:33.680 --> 36:37.260
when like that doesn't affect your Java library.

36:37.260 --> 36:41.820
We have some additional coverage and details in this week's episode of the Linux action

36:41.820 --> 36:43.520
news program.

36:43.520 --> 36:49.260
Check out linuxactionnews.com slash 80 for discussions on also their impending IPO.

36:49.260 --> 36:50.780
But I wanted to move on.

36:50.780 --> 36:55.080
I wanted to keep talking, I'll throw it to the moment room there for a moment if anybody

36:55.080 --> 36:59.760
has any commentary on Ubuntu going for 10 years of support.

36:59.760 --> 37:05.560
My early spoiler alert prediction is the next LTS of Ubuntu will just ship with 10 year

37:05.560 --> 37:08.000
support by default is what I think.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.280
Because this is what the market that they're competing in does.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.160
This is what RHEL does.

37:13.160 --> 37:14.620
This is what Microsoft does.

37:14.620 --> 37:19.720
This is what large vendors in this area that they're competing with do is 10 years of support.

37:19.720 --> 37:21.160
That's a lot of cadence though, right?

37:21.160 --> 37:22.160
I know.

37:22.160 --> 37:27.800
When you look back at the most recent LTSs that we put out like this, obviously 1804,

37:27.800 --> 37:32.480
then before that 1604 and 1404, there are still a ton of people out there who are running

37:32.480 --> 37:33.480
1404.

37:33.480 --> 37:37.400
I mean, it's not surprising there's a lot of people running 1604 because that was only

37:37.400 --> 37:38.400
two years ago.

37:38.400 --> 37:43.000
But you know, 1404 was four and a half years ago now, and there are still plenty of people

37:43.000 --> 37:48.480
out there running, which is why we backported snap support to 1404 is because we knew that

37:48.480 --> 37:54.200
there were people who wanted the latest applications on the oldest LTS that, you know, is still

37:54.200 --> 37:55.440
reasonable support.

37:55.440 --> 38:00.560
So it makes total sense to support these releases for a longer period of time.

38:00.560 --> 38:04.480
There's a snap angle to this as well, because if you have a lot of customers that are running

38:04.480 --> 38:10.520
a wide variety of versions, snaps can kind of smooth that out.

38:10.520 --> 38:17.440
But the thing that strikes me about this is Mark's up there on stage for about 10 minutes.

38:17.440 --> 38:21.720
This announcement is 30 seconds at most.

38:21.720 --> 38:23.440
Actually, let me see here.

38:23.440 --> 38:26.160
Yeah, it's 30 seconds.

38:26.160 --> 38:33.120
But in that 30 seconds, what that represents is teams of people in Canonical working away

38:33.120 --> 38:37.840
at years backporting things to this old ass version of Linux for 10 years.

38:37.840 --> 38:41.800
And you have to do it for all of the supported LTSs.

38:41.800 --> 38:47.120
It's such a simple statement to make, which represents such a massive undertaking for

38:47.120 --> 38:48.240
the company.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.800
It strikes me as one of those things.

38:49.800 --> 38:50.800
Do you agree?

38:50.800 --> 38:51.800
I do.

38:51.800 --> 38:55.960
And you know, if you want a better appreciation for what's involved in maintaining the security

38:55.960 --> 39:02.360
profile of Ubuntu, Alex Murray, who's the security tech lead in Ubuntu, does a brilliant

39:02.360 --> 39:05.680
podcast called the Ubuntu Security Podcast.

39:05.680 --> 39:07.760
It's about 10 minutes each week.

39:07.760 --> 39:13.360
And he runs down everything that the Ubuntu security team patched, fixed or otherwise

39:13.360 --> 39:18.120
improved and goes into the details behind the CVEs and the vulnerabilities.

39:18.120 --> 39:23.280
So if you want to get a real feel for the pace and momentum behind the work that the

39:23.280 --> 39:26.920
security team do, 10 minutes a week and you'll learn an awful lot.

39:26.920 --> 39:27.920
Yeah, I like that 10 minutes.

39:27.920 --> 39:29.480
Will you put a link to that in the show notes?

39:29.480 --> 39:30.480
Absolutely.

39:30.480 --> 39:31.480
We will have a link in the show notes.

39:31.480 --> 39:32.480
People want to check that out.

39:32.480 --> 39:33.480
Ubuntu security podcast.org.

39:33.480 --> 39:34.480
I've listened to a few myself.

39:34.480 --> 39:36.440
I enjoyed it a lot.

39:36.440 --> 39:39.280
You also touched on snaps there as well.

39:39.280 --> 39:44.800
And, you know, whilst yes, if you have snap capability on your system, then you're able

39:44.800 --> 39:49.160
to install these applications, you know, forwards and backwards.

39:49.160 --> 39:54.440
But the other property that snaps give you is you could take legacy applications that

39:54.440 --> 39:58.040
were deployed on Linux from the past.

39:58.040 --> 40:04.560
You could create a snap of that, you know, artisanally bundle everything that that aged

40:04.560 --> 40:10.960
application requires in a confined, isolated container, and now you can install that snap

40:10.960 --> 40:17.080
on, you know, any of the supported distributions without exposing the whole system to those

40:17.080 --> 40:18.080
old libraries.

40:18.080 --> 40:22.520
Yeah, and not having to go through these flag day, you know, changes when a new release

40:22.520 --> 40:23.520
comes out.

40:23.520 --> 40:28.520
You have to now update your application, as Wes said, to support the new glibc or whatever.

40:28.520 --> 40:32.380
I think that snaps honestly, like it makes sense because with snaps, it allows them the

40:32.380 --> 40:37.880
opportunity to, you know, all of this maintenance that you would normally have to do back porting

40:37.880 --> 40:38.880
it 10 years.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.660
I mean, that normally would be a nightmare.

40:40.660 --> 40:45.360
But if you've got that all isolated, that makes the core maintenance quite a bit less.

40:45.360 --> 40:49.200
I thought that we might end up like with a Windows 2000 situation where there have been

40:49.200 --> 40:52.920
applications that have been running on me for like 10, 15 years running on me for so

40:52.920 --> 40:58.120
long that the company that made it might not exist anymore, and it might be a business

40:58.120 --> 41:02.960
creation that no one knows how to port to the new version of iOS, so having it as a

41:02.960 --> 41:03.960
snap would be excellent.

41:03.960 --> 41:04.960
Yeah.

41:04.960 --> 41:07.280
You can just like put it on whatever and it will work.

41:07.280 --> 41:11.840
Well, so not only is there the old legacy enterprise application angle, and, you know,

41:11.840 --> 41:15.760
to a lot of these degrees, Flatpak solves this as well, but there's also I think what

41:15.760 --> 41:19.240
Wimpy was kind of getting at too is there's sort of the historical preservation.

41:19.240 --> 41:24.540
We preserve physical pieces of art, but we're not really good at preserving digital pieces

41:24.540 --> 41:25.600
of art.

41:25.600 --> 41:30.680
And sometimes because the technology moves on, these old pieces of art can't even run

41:30.680 --> 41:31.680
anymore.

41:31.680 --> 41:34.980
And so being able to create a self-contained environment where you could preserve maybe

41:34.980 --> 41:41.160
your favorite video game or your favorite old spreadsheet program, you know, that's

41:41.160 --> 41:42.160
really important.

41:42.160 --> 41:43.160
And I mean, I don't think it's right.

41:43.160 --> 41:47.040
We shouldn't think about it necessarily only an old stuff too, like getting the ability

41:47.040 --> 41:50.720
to have that flexibility also means you can use newer systems that might be supported

41:50.720 --> 41:51.720
or get the latest security.

41:51.720 --> 41:54.920
It means I can move on too without having to lose that legacy.

41:54.920 --> 41:55.920
Exactly.

41:55.920 --> 41:56.920
Oh, that's good stuff.

41:56.920 --> 41:57.920
All right.

41:57.920 --> 42:00.280
Well, let's shift gears and talk about docs here for a moment.

42:00.280 --> 42:02.160
Wimpy really got us excited about this recently.

42:02.160 --> 42:03.160
We've been drooling all week.

42:03.160 --> 42:04.160
We have.

42:04.160 --> 42:07.720
And Zach the penguin wrote into the show just a little bit before we went on the air and

42:07.720 --> 42:11.900
he says, hi, Chris, you mentioned looking at getting a docking station and I found very

42:11.900 --> 42:15.160
little online that suggests docs work well with Linux.

42:15.160 --> 42:20.260
Would love to hear more about what doc you selected and how well it is working.

42:20.260 --> 42:24.520
So I thought I would give my report on the doc that I ended up purchasing after last

42:24.520 --> 42:25.520
week's episode.

42:25.520 --> 42:30.360
I just decided to pull the trigger because I felt like this was an area that maybe the

42:30.360 --> 42:32.560
Linux audience could use just some hands on experience.

42:32.560 --> 42:35.600
There's a lot of uncertainty, you know, like any of this, it's all kind of brand new.

42:35.600 --> 42:36.600
Right.

42:36.600 --> 42:43.280
And in my case, this was a $367 doc and that's a big chunk of change to not know if you can

42:43.280 --> 42:44.280
even plug in and make it work.

42:44.280 --> 42:45.280
Yeah.

42:45.280 --> 42:46.280
I'm not going to spend that money knowing it won't work.

42:46.280 --> 42:47.280
No way.

42:47.280 --> 42:48.280
No way.

42:48.280 --> 42:50.720
So I thought, okay, well, I'm, I was really wanting to come to a doc solution and Wimpy

42:50.720 --> 42:55.420
had found like a professional grade Lenovo doc that may have even been a touch more price

42:55.420 --> 42:58.320
wise in this, but had a lot more ports than this does.

42:58.320 --> 42:59.660
So there's a couple of different options here.

42:59.660 --> 43:03.760
But so since Wimpy went with that one, which is working well, I don't know Wimpy just for

43:03.760 --> 43:05.960
the sake of completion, do you know the model again?

43:05.960 --> 43:09.640
Is it just called the Lenovo professional Thunderbolt doc?

43:09.640 --> 43:10.640
I think that's what it's just called.

43:10.640 --> 43:11.640
Yeah.

43:11.640 --> 43:12.640
Yeah.

43:12.640 --> 43:15.720
It's called, yeah, the Thunderbolt doc gen two, I think it is.

43:15.720 --> 43:19.640
It's hard to decide if like the different docs Lenovo has can be pretty tricky.

43:19.640 --> 43:21.240
I've linked to it for the last couple of weeks though.

43:21.240 --> 43:22.240
That's the easiest way.

43:22.240 --> 43:23.240
Yeah.

43:23.240 --> 43:25.960
Anyway, so specific to this model of laptop as well.

43:25.960 --> 43:26.960
Okay.

43:26.960 --> 43:27.960
That's good to know.

43:27.960 --> 43:33.920
So I sort of tucked and rolled and went with the Lenovo Thunderbolt three graphics doc

43:33.920 --> 43:38.520
and it's got Lenovo on the name, but my understanding is it's not necessarily Lenovo specific, though

43:38.520 --> 43:40.600
the packaging does sort of pitch it that way.

43:40.600 --> 43:43.440
In fact, the packaging makes it sound like it doesn't even work with my laptop.

43:43.440 --> 43:51.400
So when I got the box, I was a little apprehensive because for $367, I kind of have some expectations.

43:51.400 --> 43:57.280
And what I want to get out of this is I have two display port driven 21 inch or no 27 inch

43:57.280 --> 43:59.280
2k monitors.

43:59.280 --> 44:01.600
Then one is vertical and one's horizontal.

44:01.600 --> 44:04.080
I want to be able to plug in and have them light up.

44:04.080 --> 44:07.160
I want to have my sound system plugged in because I have pretty nice speakers up in

44:07.160 --> 44:08.160
my office.

44:08.160 --> 44:11.080
I want to have a couple of USB devices, like a nice webcam.

44:11.080 --> 44:14.480
The dream, right, where you like you bring your laptop in from the road, you just flew

44:14.480 --> 44:18.400
in, you set it down, you plug in one cable, you get power and you have your full desktop

44:18.400 --> 44:19.400
experience.

44:19.400 --> 44:20.400
Totally.

44:20.400 --> 44:22.200
That is 100% what I want to do.

44:22.200 --> 44:29.160
And I did buy a Lenovo, well Linux Academy did, that is only Intel and that was very

44:29.160 --> 44:31.920
intentional for heat and power and Wayland.

44:31.920 --> 44:34.520
I just wanted to go Intel only.

44:34.520 --> 44:39.640
But there is a part of me that every now and then really would love to play a game.

44:39.640 --> 44:46.000
You don't happen to do it very often, so I wouldn't even consider myself a regular gamer,

44:46.000 --> 44:47.840
but I am a sporadic gamer.

44:47.840 --> 44:52.480
And so the concept of having an external Thunderbolt dock that had a graphics card in it was very

44:52.480 --> 44:53.480
appealing.

44:53.480 --> 44:57.120
But everything I looked at was nearly the size of a PC tower.

44:57.120 --> 44:58.880
It was huge.

44:58.880 --> 45:02.480
And even the ones that weren't super huge were very limited on the ports.

45:02.480 --> 45:07.680
Like they maybe had some USB and none of them would have Ethernet, you know, like I really

45:07.680 --> 45:08.680
want Ethernet.

45:08.680 --> 45:10.560
It's no good if you have to have more than one thing.

45:10.560 --> 45:13.360
Like the whole point is to be the only device you plug in.

45:13.360 --> 45:18.240
So this is why I was willing to spend the money hoping it worked on the Lenovo Thunderbolt

45:18.240 --> 45:19.800
3 graphics dock.

45:19.800 --> 45:23.920
Baked into this dock and it's not overly large.

45:23.920 --> 45:25.960
All of these are about the same size.

45:25.960 --> 45:27.700
It's a very slim profile.

45:27.700 --> 45:33.560
It has a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card built in.

45:33.560 --> 45:38.460
I don't remember off the top of my head right now how much RAM is on it, but it's a decent

45:38.460 --> 45:39.460
amount.

45:39.460 --> 45:43.440
Again, I'm not looking for even 4K gaming here.

45:43.440 --> 45:46.000
For the most part, I'm looking to do 1080p gaming.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.120
You want to go from the difference of I have integrated graphics and can game basically

45:50.120 --> 45:54.000
not at all to, okay, I'll play some things on whatever settings are reasonable.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
Once a month.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.640
So it's not a huge thing, but when I do have the opportunity, I really want to be able

45:58.640 --> 45:59.640
to do it.

45:59.640 --> 46:02.640
Or maybe you have like a sudden video processing workload that you just need to sit down and

46:02.640 --> 46:03.640
get through.

46:03.640 --> 46:05.280
Yeah, that absolutely can happen as well.

46:05.280 --> 46:10.240
So I hooked it up and the first thing, I didn't know which USB-C port to put it in.

46:10.240 --> 46:12.900
First time I plugged it in, I got power right away.

46:12.900 --> 46:15.720
And this thing's pretty decent power delivery.

46:15.720 --> 46:18.160
It's a 175 watt dock.

46:18.160 --> 46:21.760
So you're going to be able, or I'm sorry, 170 watt power dock.

46:21.760 --> 46:24.280
So you're going to be able to charge your battery pretty fast.

46:24.280 --> 46:26.560
It's got a one USB 2.0 port.

46:26.560 --> 46:29.600
It's got two USB 3.0 ports.

46:29.600 --> 46:32.940
One of which is always on, which has got a little lightning bolt to indicate which one's

46:32.940 --> 46:35.640
always on, so you want to charge your phone or something like that.

46:35.640 --> 46:39.400
It has two DisplayPort 1.2 ports on the back.

46:39.400 --> 46:41.280
One HDMI 2.0 port.

46:41.280 --> 46:43.800
It has one headphone jack on the front.

46:43.800 --> 46:44.800
What?

46:44.800 --> 46:45.800
That legacy port?

46:45.800 --> 46:46.800
I know, right?

46:46.800 --> 46:48.760
Mine's got the courage port as well.

46:48.760 --> 46:50.560
I love it.

46:50.560 --> 46:52.280
Oh, man.

46:52.280 --> 46:56.680
One gigabit ethernet, and then in the box it comes with the power adapter, obviously,

46:56.680 --> 47:03.720
and a very, very short Thunderbolt 3 cable that barely reaches for my setup.

47:03.720 --> 47:06.840
And all in all, I plugged it in, the first time I plugged it in, I plugged it into the

47:06.840 --> 47:10.760
power USB-C port and nothing happened other than powering my laptop.

47:10.760 --> 47:14.880
The second time I plugged it in, I plugged it into the main USB-C port that you're supposed

47:14.880 --> 47:15.880
to.

47:15.880 --> 47:16.880
The correct port.

47:16.880 --> 47:20.180
And everything was good for like a good 20 seconds and my machine locked up and I had

47:20.180 --> 47:21.560
to hard reboot.

47:21.560 --> 47:26.020
But when I rebooted, I came back up and everything was detected.

47:26.020 --> 47:27.020
And I did that.

47:27.020 --> 47:28.020
I love this.

47:28.020 --> 47:32.280
There's this command sudo ubuntu-drivers, can't remember the exact syntax, but it's

47:32.280 --> 47:33.280
like auto install.

47:33.280 --> 47:34.280
Yes.

47:34.280 --> 47:35.280
Yeah.

47:35.280 --> 47:36.280
Thank you.

47:36.280 --> 47:40.200
And I just do that and it just goes and gets the NVIDIA 390 something driver, loads up

47:40.200 --> 47:42.640
the NVIDIA driver, NVIDIA settings control panel for me.

47:42.640 --> 47:45.200
I do one more reboot to make it all clean.

47:45.200 --> 47:49.440
And sure enough, I open up the NVIDIA settings control panel and I can see all the information

47:49.440 --> 47:50.680
about my video card.

47:50.680 --> 47:53.720
Now, I didn't have the right display adapter cords.

47:53.720 --> 47:57.280
I had display port to mini display port, which doesn't work with my monitor.

47:57.280 --> 48:00.920
So I haven't yet hooked up my external monitors.

48:00.920 --> 48:06.920
But this gave me an opportunity to find out if the internal display, the 1080p display

48:06.920 --> 48:12.840
that's built into my Lenovo laptop, if that could be accelerated by the NVIDIA chip in

48:12.840 --> 48:16.880
the external dock, which if you think about it, means you're round tripping a lot of video

48:16.880 --> 48:19.240
data over that Thunderbolt 3 cable.

48:19.240 --> 48:20.640
Didn't know if this was possible.

48:20.640 --> 48:25.000
I didn't really know how to check to see which video card was powering my desktop.

48:25.000 --> 48:29.280
I looked at LSPCI, I looked at the NVIDIA control panel and it all kind of seemed to

48:29.280 --> 48:35.240
imply that my built in screen was being powered by the NVIDIA graphics card in the external

48:35.240 --> 48:36.240
dock.

48:36.240 --> 48:37.240
All right.

48:37.240 --> 48:40.800
I thought, well, the only one way to really find out, let's fire up some games.

48:40.800 --> 48:42.240
So get serious.

48:42.240 --> 48:48.280
I've recently got back into playing Star Trek Online under wine, under Linux, of course,

48:48.280 --> 48:53.080
and it's been actually playable-ish with the Intel graphics.

48:53.080 --> 48:55.880
I mean, I feel like it has to be because you don't game that much.

48:55.880 --> 48:59.600
So are you really going to play a bunch of a game that doesn't work?

48:59.600 --> 49:00.600
No.

49:00.600 --> 49:02.160
And so it was playable-ish.

49:02.160 --> 49:03.700
Space combat was fine.

49:03.700 --> 49:07.360
Ground combat was laggy, which is so typical Star Trek Online.

49:07.360 --> 49:15.080
So I fire up the Star Trek Online and I immediately can tell even at the login screen that something's

49:15.080 --> 49:16.080
different.

49:16.080 --> 49:21.880
So I go in, I turn up the settings, do all of that, jump into the game, smooth as butter.

49:21.880 --> 49:26.360
So the next thing I do, I close out, I load up Bioshock 2, go into there, full settings,

49:26.360 --> 49:32.680
Bioshock 2, hit play, smooth as butter, full screen, 1080p, again, that's all I need, right?

49:32.680 --> 49:38.800
It is legitimately accelerating the graphics on my built in Lenovo display with no external

49:38.800 --> 49:42.720
displays hooked up to the dock, which I will have eventually, but for right now, I can

49:42.720 --> 49:46.000
still get benefit out of that NVIDIA chip just with my single display.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.240
Even without all the cables you need.

49:47.240 --> 49:48.240
I've got my power.

49:48.240 --> 49:50.080
I've got my USB devices all hooked up.

49:50.080 --> 49:54.120
And now I've got actual playable 3D graphics on that thing.

49:54.120 --> 49:57.120
Sounds like Wimpy might have a little command line magic to help you out here, too.

49:57.120 --> 49:58.120
Oh, really?

49:58.120 --> 49:59.120
What's this, Wimpy?

49:59.120 --> 50:00.120
Some command line lerv?

50:00.120 --> 50:01.120
Right.

50:01.120 --> 50:02.120
Okay.

50:02.120 --> 50:03.120
Yeah.

50:03.120 --> 50:06.640
So listeners of the Ubuntu podcast will know we have a segment called command line lerv.

50:06.640 --> 50:09.240
So I've got some command line love for you.

50:09.240 --> 50:13.520
What you need is prime hyphen select.

50:13.520 --> 50:21.480
And if you do prime hyphen select and query, it will tell you what video subsystem is currently

50:21.480 --> 50:22.480
enabled.

50:22.480 --> 50:23.480
So on my system, it says NVIDIA.

50:23.480 --> 50:27.560
And is this part of the NVIDIA drivers graphics package that were this?

50:27.560 --> 50:32.600
This is part of the Ubuntu additions to the NVIDIA drivers.

50:32.600 --> 50:36.040
NVIDIA dash prime looks like the package that contains it.

50:36.040 --> 50:41.520
And if you do prime hyphen select and then type either NVIDIA or Intel, it will switch

50:41.520 --> 50:44.540
the drivers between the two modes.

50:44.540 --> 50:48.160
And then all you need to do is log out and log back in.

50:48.160 --> 50:53.480
And those drivers for that GPU or IGP will be enabled in the ones that you're using.

50:53.480 --> 50:54.480
Awesome.

50:54.480 --> 50:57.120
So that's how you can do it at the command line.

50:57.120 --> 51:02.400
Users of the glorious, glorious Ubuntu Marte will automatically have an applet appear in

51:02.400 --> 51:07.560
their taskbar when you've got a prime capable system.

51:07.560 --> 51:12.520
And it will show you an icon which GPU you've got, so an Intel logo for Intel, an NVIDIA

51:12.520 --> 51:16.320
logo for Intel, and a means to just toggle it through a simple UI.

51:16.320 --> 51:19.240
That Ubuntu Marte, that's a clever distribution that they're...

51:19.240 --> 51:20.240
Yeah.

51:20.240 --> 51:22.120
And that was Mark's idea from the Ubuntu podcast.

51:22.120 --> 51:29.840
He reviewed Ubuntu Marte 1504 on a super stellar Entroware that had hybrid graphics.

51:29.840 --> 51:32.120
And he said, what we need is a tool to do this.

51:32.120 --> 51:33.120
So I wrote one.

51:33.120 --> 51:34.120
That is awesome.

51:34.120 --> 51:35.120
That's great.

51:35.120 --> 51:41.000
And it looks like there's also Fedora Prime, which is the same thing for Fedora and other

51:41.000 --> 51:42.960
distributions to be able to do that.

51:42.960 --> 51:43.960
So that's cool.

51:43.960 --> 51:44.960
So that's something...

51:44.960 --> 51:45.960
Can we...

51:45.960 --> 51:46.960
Will you also toss links to that in the show notes?

51:46.960 --> 51:47.960
Yeah.

51:47.960 --> 51:50.920
That'll be for me after the show.

51:50.920 --> 51:57.080
So at this point, I've now tried my Lenovo ThinkPad out with three separate Thunderbolt

51:57.080 --> 51:58.280
3 docks.

51:58.280 --> 52:02.960
One which was an OWC dock that was originally purchased for a MacBook, which got repurposed

52:02.960 --> 52:04.720
now for the ThinkPad.

52:04.720 --> 52:09.280
Another which is a cheapo one that I got off Amazon, I can't remember the name of it.

52:09.280 --> 52:12.520
And now this graphics enabled Thunderbolt 3 dock.

52:12.520 --> 52:15.860
And this was the trickiest of them all, I feel.

52:15.860 --> 52:20.480
It was the one that I thought for sure would not work, especially not with the internal

52:20.480 --> 52:21.480
graphics.

52:21.480 --> 52:24.880
And I'm really, really just pleased that it's worked as well as it has.

52:24.880 --> 52:31.180
I can't necessarily say I wholeheartedly recommend this dock.

52:31.180 --> 52:34.000
It really kind of depends on what you want to do.

52:34.000 --> 52:38.820
If I was going to spend the money again, I would probably still buy it, but I would still

52:38.820 --> 52:44.640
give another serious consideration to the dock that Wimpy got because it has more ports.

52:44.640 --> 52:45.720
And I'm already kind of...

52:45.720 --> 52:46.720
I'm out of USB ports.

52:46.720 --> 52:50.800
I've got cables hanging off the front of this thing that I don't like the way that

52:50.800 --> 52:51.800
looks.

52:51.800 --> 52:52.800
Yeah.

52:52.800 --> 52:53.800
What?

52:53.800 --> 52:54.800
A dock in a USB hub?

52:54.800 --> 52:55.800
Who does that?

52:55.800 --> 52:56.800
Yeah.

52:56.800 --> 52:57.800
Right?

52:57.800 --> 52:58.800
Where Wimpy has more USB ports.

52:58.800 --> 52:59.800
It has more of the ports on the back.

52:59.800 --> 53:00.800
All of that, right?

53:00.800 --> 53:01.800
Because I've got my headphone jack on the front.

53:01.800 --> 53:02.800
But no graphics, right?

53:02.800 --> 53:03.800
Right.

53:03.800 --> 53:06.680
So this particular setup, that's a compromise I'm willing to make.

53:06.680 --> 53:08.240
I'm willing to make because I don't need a lot.

53:08.240 --> 53:12.760
I need a couple of USB devices, a couple of monitors, and I want 3D graphics.

53:12.760 --> 53:15.000
So for me, it's delivering what I want.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
But it's just like...

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
Might not be right for everyone.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.840
Just keep in mind, you're compromising a little bit on the ports.

53:18.840 --> 53:20.440
At least you do get gigabit.

53:20.440 --> 53:24.360
That was the real deal-sealer for me, is I like getting my gigabit.

53:24.360 --> 53:25.800
And that's nice to have that built in.

53:25.800 --> 53:32.120
So I will have links to the specific model that I bought on Amazon.

53:32.120 --> 53:35.840
They don't give me a commission, so it's not for that.

53:35.840 --> 53:36.840
Let's not get into that.

53:36.840 --> 53:37.840
But you know what?

53:37.840 --> 53:41.440
Maybe we should mention at this point, speaking of saving some money, Linux Academy is doing

53:41.440 --> 53:44.840
a Black Friday sale, Cyber Monday sale.

53:44.840 --> 53:49.820
And it essentially cuts off a huge amount of the price and makes it around like 30 bucks

53:49.820 --> 53:50.820
a month or less.

53:50.820 --> 53:52.440
Somewhere right in that neighborhood.

53:52.440 --> 53:57.380
But the bigger deal is you lock that in for the lifetime of the account.

53:57.380 --> 53:59.140
Now consider what that means.

53:59.140 --> 54:04.880
They are growing like crazy, adding, they just this year added 420 plus new types of

54:04.880 --> 54:10.760
individual usable content and consumable learning activities and training lessons and video

54:10.760 --> 54:11.760
courses.

54:11.760 --> 54:12.760
Way over 420.

54:12.760 --> 54:16.500
In fact, I think in the last quarter, it was more like 500 just in one quarter.

54:16.500 --> 54:21.120
But my point is, you get this Black Friday price or Cyber Monday price and you lock it

54:21.120 --> 54:22.120
in for the lifetime of the account.

54:22.120 --> 54:25.280
So if you're a subscriber now for five years, you're getting that price.

54:25.280 --> 54:27.640
And they update the existing content.

54:27.640 --> 54:31.600
So if you forgot some, you come back five years later, you still got your account, then

54:31.600 --> 54:32.600
that's right there.

54:32.600 --> 54:36.680
And then here's the other thing that I didn't really appreciate until just recently.

54:36.680 --> 54:39.540
Existing students can also go get the price.

54:39.540 --> 54:44.240
So if you're paying the regular price right now, yeah, you can go get the Black Friday

54:44.240 --> 54:47.440
Cyber Monday price and then just lock it in for your subscription.

54:47.440 --> 54:51.360
So I wanted to point that out, linuxacademy.com.

54:51.360 --> 54:53.600
Just go there like on Black Friday that I'll be there.

54:53.600 --> 54:58.040
Plus on their live page, you can see the live streams I did announcing some of the new content

54:58.040 --> 54:59.840
with Anthony, which is fun.

54:59.840 --> 55:02.040
We ended up doing four of them.

55:02.040 --> 55:03.600
They have a streaming machine.

55:03.600 --> 55:08.200
Yeah, we went from, like when I first went down there the first time, it was like a kind

55:08.200 --> 55:09.200
of rough shot.

55:09.200 --> 55:11.960
We just did it out of Anthony's office, set up an OBS machine, and it was just kind of

55:11.960 --> 55:12.960
a little crazy.

55:12.960 --> 55:20.520
But now they got like a video studio with a 4K Blackmagic camera and LED lighting, yeah,

55:20.520 --> 55:22.160
like a physical set and all of that.

55:22.160 --> 55:23.160
It's very impressive.

55:23.160 --> 55:27.200
One other just thing before we completely move off of the Thunderbolt doc, I'll just

55:27.200 --> 55:28.600
a little quick mention.

55:28.600 --> 55:30.680
You do want to go learn Bolt.

55:30.680 --> 55:34.280
I don't know, Wimpy, if you have any Bolt advice, but this is going to be specifically

55:34.280 --> 55:39.800
Bolt CTL, the command line client that you can use from any desktop environment to authorize

55:39.800 --> 55:40.920
your Thunderbolt doc.

55:40.920 --> 55:41.920
So I've got a question.

55:41.920 --> 55:44.680
Yeah, you do need to learn to use Bolt.

55:44.680 --> 55:50.240
There's another tool that was also developed by Intel, but Bolt is the better option.

55:50.240 --> 55:51.960
Answer me this.

55:51.960 --> 55:57.760
When you said your computer locked up, was that after you ran Bolt to authorize the device?

55:57.760 --> 56:00.960
It must have been because it was just almost immediately after I connected it.

56:00.960 --> 56:01.960
Yeah.

56:01.960 --> 56:07.800
So what I've found is if you've got a GPU in a Thunderbolt doc and you authorize the

56:07.800 --> 56:14.560
device, then it hangs the system because you basically just thrust a GPU into the PCI lanes

56:14.560 --> 56:18.520
of the computer.

56:18.520 --> 56:23.020
Now if you've got an external GPU enclosure, like some of the ones that I have, the way

56:23.020 --> 56:30.280
I do this is I pull the GPU out of the GPU enclosure, plug the external GPU in with no

56:30.280 --> 56:36.160
card in it, authenticate the device that way, and then shut it all down, disconnect it,

56:36.160 --> 56:37.160
and then plug the card in.

56:37.160 --> 56:42.320
Because you're not authenticating the graphics card that's inside the doc, you're authenticating

56:42.320 --> 56:43.720
the doc itself.

56:43.720 --> 56:48.260
Now in your case, you don't have that luxury because the card is fused into the doc.

56:48.260 --> 56:53.120
So yes, unfortunately, that first run is a bit hairy scary.

56:53.120 --> 56:54.760
And yeah, I have encountered that.

56:54.760 --> 56:59.000
Just make sure you run sync on the command line before you do that.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
Yeah, yeah.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.560
Yeah, get everything flushed.

57:02.560 --> 57:07.360
I've got another command line, luv, which is sort of a GUI luv for you.

57:07.360 --> 57:15.200
If you want to do that prime switching, but with GUI, if you run nvidia settings dash P

57:15.200 --> 57:20.920
and then space and then all in caps prime, it will open nvidia settings on the prime

57:20.920 --> 57:27.200
profile selection page, which has got the toggle to switch between Intel and nvidia.

57:27.200 --> 57:28.200
Killer tip.

57:28.200 --> 57:29.200
Thank you.

57:29.200 --> 57:30.200
Thank you, Wimpy.

57:30.200 --> 57:31.200
That's great.

57:31.200 --> 57:32.360
I will probably just use the command line version.

57:32.360 --> 57:34.620
But that's good for anybody that just wants to avoid the command line.

57:34.620 --> 57:36.320
Some people make it their mission.

57:36.320 --> 57:39.840
And while I think that's a little cray cray, I say embrace the command line.

57:39.840 --> 57:41.920
And you're using Linux, come on.

57:41.920 --> 57:45.240
You heard him say it there, too, they have tips like that all the time on the Ubuntu

57:45.240 --> 57:46.240
podcast.

57:46.240 --> 57:47.240
Go check it out.

57:47.240 --> 57:48.600
Ubuntu podcast.org.

57:48.600 --> 57:51.560
Get more wimpy poppy and mark two over there.

57:51.560 --> 57:54.560
Yeah, so docs, I have the big thumbs up for it.

57:54.560 --> 57:55.760
All right, let's keep going.

57:55.760 --> 57:57.600
Let's talk about this new automation system.

57:57.600 --> 58:01.840
In fact, Wes was plugging away at a new phase of our automation system.

58:01.840 --> 58:03.860
And it's going to be a beast.

58:03.860 --> 58:09.400
It's going to eventually when all is said and done, the process will go from editing

58:09.400 --> 58:12.200
into the system, which has yet to be named.

58:12.200 --> 58:17.240
It'll be rendered to MP3, it'll be rendered to video files, it can be rendered to multiple

58:17.240 --> 58:19.280
formats, really.

58:19.280 --> 58:23.540
It'll be distributed around the internet, it gets rendered to a particular visualized

58:23.540 --> 58:27.560
type of video, it has text, it'll have artwork that it creates.

58:27.560 --> 58:28.560
Chapters.

58:28.560 --> 58:33.480
It'll add the chapter markers, it'll publish it to the RSS feeds, it'll eventually publish

58:33.480 --> 58:34.480
it to the website.

58:34.480 --> 58:38.000
I mean, these have yet to arrive, but it is a system.

58:38.000 --> 58:43.200
And the idea is once you submit the work from the editor, everything's basically automated

58:43.200 --> 58:45.320
from editing to the publishing.

58:45.320 --> 58:46.320
Everything's automated.

58:46.320 --> 58:50.240
Between the final edited WAV file and the show notes that we prepare, that's it.

58:50.240 --> 58:51.680
You can't automate Joe.

58:51.680 --> 58:52.680
But everything after Joe, you can.

58:52.680 --> 58:53.680
We're trying really hard.

58:53.680 --> 58:59.080
All right, so we have launched a straw poll to see what the hell we should actually name

58:59.080 --> 59:00.080
this thing.

59:00.080 --> 59:01.880
The community submitted a ton of names.

59:01.880 --> 59:03.840
I did not actually count, but it was hundreds.

59:03.840 --> 59:06.520
Let's just say thousands to make them feel good.

59:06.520 --> 59:10.480
It was one of the larger spreadsheets I've ever had to sift through.

59:10.480 --> 59:14.200
And which two names do you think, wow, people could vote for two names.

59:14.200 --> 59:16.720
Wow, look at Angel letting them go.

59:16.720 --> 59:20.360
Which two names work best for the Jupyter broadcasting automation system?

59:20.360 --> 59:28.880
We have Autopod, Podpublisher, Podmaker, Jupytercaster, Castablasta, which, oh, that's a little bias

59:28.880 --> 59:29.880
for me.

59:29.880 --> 59:30.880
It is.

59:30.880 --> 59:33.280
Yeah, that's for people that have been listening for a really long time.

59:33.280 --> 59:34.680
Yeah, that's Castablasta.

59:34.680 --> 59:38.660
They publish, OpenPublishMe, which I kind of like that one.

59:38.660 --> 59:46.780
But I guess it's kind of generic, Bylove, Autopody, Podpublisher, JupyterPodcaster,

59:46.780 --> 59:49.580
and Podblisher.

59:49.580 --> 59:50.580
You can't have Podpublisher.

59:50.580 --> 59:51.580
I know.

59:51.580 --> 59:52.580
That's off the table.

59:52.580 --> 59:53.580
I know.

59:53.580 --> 59:54.580
Was Podpublisher in there?

59:54.580 --> 59:55.580
Oh, yeah.

59:55.580 --> 59:56.580
No, Podpusher.

59:56.580 --> 59:57.580
It was Podpusher.

59:57.580 --> 59:59.160
And Podpublisher, you said.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:03.920
We've got some software called Podpublish, so let's not get those clattered.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.740
It was Podbilish, but I agree.

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:08.240
We don't want any name collisions.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.520
You and I are on the same page, though.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.080
Because my vote really is, I probably shouldn't say what my vote is.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.220
What about Autopody?

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:16.520
Did you say that one?

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.520
I think I did say Autopody.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.520
Yeah, I think I did.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.520
Because that's a good one.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:24.080
All right, I'm making my votes.

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.080
Let's see here.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:30.120
Oh, Castablasta is coming at 21% right now, Autopod, and then Jupytercaster, and then

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.120
Podpusher.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:33.240
But we'll keep it open for a while.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:37.760
And if you voted before, this is a new link, so make sure you go listen to this episode.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.360
If you're listening, go vote again.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.360
Refine.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.360
A refined...

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.340
A better selection of the best suggestions from the wonderful community.

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:50.800
We have 99 votes right now, so you are very much still in that phase where you could move

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:51.800
the needle.

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:55.920
And remember, if you don't vote, you can't complain.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.880
And boy, I'm looking forward to see where that goes.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.720
All right, we got another email into the show, this one from Albert.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:06.720
He says, howdy, I just switched to my Dell 17-inch Core i3 laptop to elementary OS from

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:07.720
Windows.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.720
Oh.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.920
I love all of the OS to a point.

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:17.960
But recently, I got my wife her first MacBook, and my question is, is there a YouTube app

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:18.960
or Linux snap?

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:23.700
Because she's got one, and I would like to have a desktop YouTube application.

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:24.700
No web browser.

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:27.940
He says he's used something similar on the Mac in the past.

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:29.720
He's been listening to the podcast for about a year.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:30.720
Keep up the great work.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:35.240
Albert from West Fargo, do we have any YouTube desktop applications?

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.960
Now I'm going to just mention the obvious one here, because I'm sure this is on the

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.280
tip of everybody's tongue.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:46.080
You could just use YouTube DL, which is a package in your local repo that will just

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:51.100
give it the URL of a YouTube file and a video, and it will pull it down into pretty much

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:52.580
any format you want.

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:54.280
And there are graphical front ends to that.

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:58.600
I'm not sure if they're in the elementary app store or app center, but they're definitely

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.600
in the larger repository.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:05.280
I will also say that MPV, just if you have YouTube DL, it'll integrate and you just paste

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.120
that YouTube link there and hey.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.520
Just MPV and then the URL to the YouTube video.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:10.520
And you're good.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.960
There was also, there also used to be like Minitube.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:13.960
Minitube's out there.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:14.960
I'm linking that right now.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:15.960
So that's one option.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.080
I haven't, I haven't used it.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:22.060
But anybody in the, Mr. Drifter, do you have like a YouTube app that you use to watch videos

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:23.540
without the web browser?

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:27.040
So I'm actually on board with you, I generally just use YouTube DL.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:32.520
But I had one of my buddies point out, it's an app for, from NPM, it's called Natafire.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.800
And essentially you can pass it any URL and it will make it a electron app.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.400
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.400
That's another way you could go.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.360
And then you just make yourself like a YouTube application.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:47.280
It's a web app, but it's, it's an own standalone thing independent from your browser.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.620
You could have it logged into a separate Google account.

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:52.900
So there could be some real advantages to doing that.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:56.480
And if you have one, yeah, Minitube, okay, great, yeah, Minitube, which is, boy, that's

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.480
a weird URL.

01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.480
We should probably throw that in the show notes.

01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:59.480
Already done.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.480
Thank you, sir.

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.740
You are on top of it today.

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:05.080
Show notes, again, linuxunplug.com slash 276.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.200
Here's another app that we're going to have in those show notes.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.300
It's called WebTTY.

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:13.700
You can share a terminal session over WebRTC.

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:17.760
Years ago, I talked about something similar to this, but it wasn't using WebRTC.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.880
This is the differentiating factor here.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:27.560
You essentially use this built-in browser technology, you pair with a friend, and you

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:28.780
don't need a proxy server.

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.440
You can do it behind NATs.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.680
It works just in browser.

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:38.160
And there's a great GIF that shows you the person who has a local session on their Linux

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.720
box and then the web browser for somebody who's watching on a Mac.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:44.060
This just made me think about your friend again, like similar situation where you could

01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:46.480
easily share something with your friend.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.080
He could just go to a URL on his Mac and start watching.

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.540
It's not very complicated.

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:53.720
It's easy to share on social media if you want to do like a demonstration.

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.400
I will say it had a little bit of trouble.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:59.460
I used it in some, let's say, exotic environments, but anywhere where you might have like a double

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:04.640
NAT, like I ran it in a couple of containers that were behind on my LAN.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:08.040
But running it on like a droplet works no problem.

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:14.520
And the pasting, the big blob of data between each other, it works pretty well.

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.280
That seemed like, okay, so they kind of tout working behind a NAT here, but you're saying...

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:23.800
No, it does, but it basically works as well as like your typical WebRTC implementation

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.280
because that's what it's doing behind the back.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.280
Sure.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.280
Yeah.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.280
Okay.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.280
That makes sense.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.120
And then some of us just refuse to accept the death of Unity.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.120
It's too hard.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:35.160
You know, got a few things right.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:39.160
And when Mark Shuttleworth announced the end of the Unity desktop and the transition to

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:42.560
GNOME, since then, you've had so many people come out of the woodwork saying, well, I kind

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.560
of liked Unity.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.560
I loved it.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:45.560
I thought it was kind of great.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.320
Can I still use Unity?

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.320
Is there a spin?

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:49.320
I don't know.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:54.520
I think there is, but there is maybe something that's a bit of a middle ground.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.440
It's a GNOME Shell extension, everybody.

01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:01.500
It's Unite Shell, a GNOME Shell extension, which makes a few layout tweaks to the top

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:06.160
panel and removes window decorations to make them look like Ubuntu Unity Shell.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:10.600
It's like when you maximize, like the close buttons go up in the title bar up top.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.080
That makes sense.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.080
Yeah.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:17.320
Anybody have any thoughts on this Unity Unite Shell extension?

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.320
Yeah, it's funny.

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:22.920
There's so many of these ways and means in which you can make your desktop look like

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:23.920
Unity.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.920
There's, you know, Michael Tunnel has done a whole guide for how you make KDE look like

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.920
it.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:33.680
We've got the thing that makes GNOME look like a bit like Unity and Martin's got Mutiny.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:41.520
And then this Linux on Dex thing that Samsung made has the GNOME flashback session or whatever

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.520
it's called.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.520
Right.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.520
Oh, yeah.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:45.520
Right.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.880
There are a lot of people who said it was terrible and awful.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:51.040
There are a lot of people who are trying to make their desktops look like it.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.480
Yeah, I have noticed.

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:56.240
And when I saw that, I was like, that actually looks kind of good.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.240
We like the design.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.240
We just don't want canonical to make it in-house.

01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.240
Yeah.

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.240
Yeah.

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.240
I guess so.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.280
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.640
Well, we'll have a link in the show notes if you want to check it out.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.360
But it's obviously it's on the GNOME extensions website.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:09.360
So you can just go grab it.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:12.240
I'm kind of tempted, but I don't have...

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.240
There's no harm in trying.

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:14.240
Actually, you know what?

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:15.240
Fedora right there.

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:16.300
I was just thinking that.

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.120
We should totally do it on the Fedora box.

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.880
That would love that.

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:20.880
That would be so great.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:21.880
All right.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:25.320
Well, that wraps up this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.320
There's just a few left.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.400
Like I said, towards the top of the show, our predictions episode is coming up soon.

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.400
So join us for that.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.400
We'll be talking about that.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.400
Yeah, I'm thinking about what's going to happen in 2019.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.280
Maybe you can blow our minds with something.

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.280
Blow our minds!

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.120
And I'm looking forward to the holidays.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.640
We got Turkey Day coming up here in the States.

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:43.160
So happy Turkey Day to everybody out there that does celebrate it.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.320
Don't forget that Black Friday sale.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.320
It's a hell of a deal.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:49.040
If you've signed up recently to support these shows, why not take advantage of the Black

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.040
Friday sale?

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.040
Why not?

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.240
Or if you're a student, or you want to get into something, do it.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:54.240
Anyways, I'm at ChrisOS.

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.240
I'm at Westpacne.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:07:22.640
We'll see you back here next Tuesday!

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:39.640
There we go.

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.640
There's a show.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:45.280
You know, you were just asking in the chat room during the outro, Drifter, about Barrier,

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:47.720
which is a Synergy alternative.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:51.600
We haven't tried it yet, just because this is my first Tuesday back in studio.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:56.440
But I think it's probably on our list to kind of consolidate down to one keyboard and mouse

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.160
and still have, we'll have one.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.640
We got to synergize the studio.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:04.280
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven screens in front of us.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:07.360
You can even like set it up so we could actually place one of our ThinkPads in there.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.440
Yeah, and then have eight screens.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:10.440
Yeah.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:11.440
Yeah.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.760
So yeah, that is something we want to play with and then do.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.080
We got a couple of segments in the works too.

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.460
We're working on some WireGuard stuff.

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:21.240
We still have some more projects we're going to be open sourcing.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:26.320
And then when we get some breathing room, we also have some announcements we want to

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.720
make around like contributions to open source projects and stuff.

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.720
So there is much in the works.

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:35.520
But right now we're doing a whole bunch of backend stuff, trying to get our ducks in

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.560
a row.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.440
And then we can get into new shows.

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:41.920
It turns out there was a lot of dust we needed to sweep up sitting behind things.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.360
Stuff that we never had resources to take care of before.

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:47.680
And now we have the resources to clean house a little bit and make things the way they

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:48.680
should be.

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:52.160
So we want some of our processes to reflect the professionalism that we're trying to aspire

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.160
to.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.760
And so some of those things just had to be changed.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:58.440
Plus, there's a whole bunch of backend like business processes stuff that we're working

01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.440
through.

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.080
But yeah, the whole merging still.

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.080
Yeah.

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.080
It's still lots of stuff out.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.360
Yeah, but it's getting so close to being done.

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:08.960
So we're working on new, we're starting to work on new projects.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.760
We're starting to make plans for next year's contributions.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:15.760
Like we're setting up like goals for our department to make sure that we reach a certain level

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.440
of contributions and stuff like that.

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:19.600
So we'll be talking about all that stuff soon.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:49.440
So that barrier, WireGuard, our automation system stuff, still a lot to come.
