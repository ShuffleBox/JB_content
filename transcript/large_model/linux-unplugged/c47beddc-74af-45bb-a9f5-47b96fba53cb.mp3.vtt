WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
I know you know this already, I'm sure, but we used Ubuntu Mate 14.04 for our broadcast

00:06.400 --> 00:10.160
station and it worked like a champ, it was great.

00:10.160 --> 00:15.240
I was grinning ear to ear when I heard that that's what you'd use, that was brilliant.

00:15.240 --> 00:20.640
It was perfect because it gave us enough of a...there are certain things we needed to

00:20.640 --> 00:24.900
be able to do that are sort of like a traditional workflow, like for example I was syncing over

00:24.900 --> 00:29.560
art assets and no one needed to be able to look at a bunch of files in Nautilus or whatever

00:29.560 --> 00:32.800
the file manager is called, and open them up in Inkscape and modify them.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.680
So there was some need to have sort of a more traditional work desktop environment on the

00:36.680 --> 00:43.640
broadcast machine but it doesn't need to be anything very high end because it really doesn't

00:43.640 --> 00:46.640
do much more other than the broadcast, it's just when we sit down to use it.

00:46.640 --> 00:50.560
So it was perfect because the low resources meant that the rest of the resources went

00:50.560 --> 00:58.780
to the broadcast and it was just perfect, it was exactly what we needed.

00:58.780 --> 01:04.280
So I know that you've been using Ubuntu Mate for some production use and there's a podcast

01:04.280 --> 01:10.440
that I'm now, I think I'm an officially a member of the team, I think that happened

01:10.440 --> 01:16.280
last time or the time before, anyway but there's a podcast that I do with Popey and Laura and

01:16.280 --> 01:23.560
Mark now and 50% of that is done with Ubuntu Mate and I know a couple of YouTubers that

01:23.560 --> 01:31.160
are doing all of their stuff on Ubuntu Mate and I know of a radio station in the US that's

01:31.160 --> 01:35.000
using Ubuntu Mate for their radio.

01:35.000 --> 01:45.240
So it's becoming quite popular as a broadcast platform and when I heard Noah and Alan talking

01:45.240 --> 01:49.700
about their trials and tribulations with setting up that machine and sleep deprivation and

01:49.700 --> 01:55.680
all the rest of it, it got me thinking maybe there's the opportunity to create an Ubuntu

01:55.680 --> 02:05.720
Mate broadcaster alternative image which comes pre-packaged with the tools that a broadcaster

02:05.720 --> 02:06.800
would want to use.

02:06.800 --> 02:14.800
So things like Mumble and OBS and video editors and audio editors and I don't know what those

02:14.800 --> 02:21.640
tools are but if you can speed up the deployment and have an out of the box, I mean there's

02:21.640 --> 02:28.620
already Ubuntu Studio which does that by building on top of Zebuntu but yeah it got me thinking

02:28.620 --> 02:32.800
maybe there's some collaboration potential on that.

02:32.800 --> 02:38.120
Yeah and that is very, it is already a bit of an advantage we noticed because a lot of

02:38.120 --> 02:44.120
times when we would set up a production machine then there is sort of setting up the, actually

02:44.120 --> 02:49.520
installing the OS is sort of the fastest part of it because then you go to the vendors website,

02:49.520 --> 02:53.320
you go get your login because you purchased the software and you have to login now and

02:53.320 --> 02:56.300
then you get the download links and then you download it and then you generate the serial

02:56.300 --> 03:00.920
number and of course you install it and then after you install it you restart and all that

03:00.920 --> 03:04.800
good stuff and then you come back online and then you launch the application and then you

03:04.800 --> 03:08.320
put the serial number in and then you activate the application and then you begin the setup

03:08.320 --> 03:12.920
process right of course and that's assuming there wasn't any drivers you had to load for

03:12.920 --> 03:16.000
the capture card which there always are.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.880
So all of these things are just completely eliminated when you do it under Linux.

03:19.880 --> 03:24.840
It's already so much faster that we were just like blown away.

03:24.840 --> 03:28.120
So I can only imagine like if it was even more streamlined and I know one thing we're

03:28.120 --> 03:33.840
thinking about doing is an image but the primary challenge is that, this is one thing I've

03:33.840 --> 03:38.680
always kind of worried about the nut to crack under Linux is there is a fine line to walk

03:38.680 --> 03:44.680
where the system would get so stagnant that like OBS would be held back or OBS would be

03:44.680 --> 03:48.480
held back for example because maybe we need a newer version of FFmpeg or something like

03:48.480 --> 03:49.480
that.

03:49.480 --> 03:53.960
So there's this line where I'm like okay today we can use a 14.04 installation.

03:53.960 --> 03:59.600
I'm not so sure if next, in fact I would be shocked if next year at Linux Fest Northwest

03:59.600 --> 04:02.920
we were still on Ubuntu 14.04.

04:02.920 --> 04:07.640
I would bet that all the underlying technology since it's being developed so rapidly is going

04:07.640 --> 04:11.760
to move forward and I would bet that it just it won't work for us.

04:11.760 --> 04:15.440
I don't know what we'll be on but I bet it's not 14.04 next year.

04:15.440 --> 04:18.520
Yeah quite possibly.

04:18.520 --> 04:24.040
One of the things I've been looking at is the idea of software channels.

04:24.040 --> 04:31.600
So there's lots and lots of PPAs out there but it's up to you to decide the quality of

04:31.600 --> 04:36.920
those PPAs and if they're just delivering a single package that they want or if it's

04:36.920 --> 04:40.800
everything under the sun you don't quite know what else you're going to drag in as a result

04:40.800 --> 04:42.120
of adding them.

04:42.120 --> 04:48.200
So I've had this idea of software channels with a UI where you can turn on like the FFmpeg

04:48.200 --> 04:54.000
software channel or the mumble software channel and it's by application and instead of you

04:54.000 --> 05:01.960
having to go and find the PPAs you just enable the applications that you're interested in

05:01.960 --> 05:09.920
and it turns on sort of pre-vetted quality PPAs that deliver those packages so typically

05:09.920 --> 05:15.760
the PPAs that are made by the developers rather than you know enthusiasts and hobbyists that

05:15.760 --> 05:21.680
might have a PPA of just you know a load of stuff that they want on their machine.

05:21.680 --> 05:25.680
That would be and of course that's how users think of it too is by the application.

05:25.680 --> 05:33.160
Yeah exactly so you have an icon and you say enable mumble channel or enable FFmpeg channel

05:33.160 --> 05:38.000
or VLC channel or LibreOffice 4.4 channel or whatever it might be.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.560
Yeah that's interesting and you know the other thing that's great about Linux is when we

05:42.560 --> 05:45.680
decide okay well now it's time to add in the audio stream it's like okay well we'll just

05:45.680 --> 05:51.360
go install DarkCast and it's just it is once all of the stuff gets in place it is so much

05:51.360 --> 05:59.000
easier to do it under Linux once the software is ready.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.320
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's still hungover from Linux

06:03.320 --> 06:05.680
Fest Northwest 2015.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.040
My name is Chris.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.040
And my name is Matt.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.040
Hey there Matt.

06:09.040 --> 06:14.880
I swear I had two beers over the course of the entire Linux Fest Northwest and yet somehow

06:14.880 --> 06:15.880
I feel hungover.

06:15.880 --> 06:20.120
I felt hungover for a couple of days and then I realized it wasn't so much the Fest itself

06:20.120 --> 06:26.000
it was like the six or seven days leading up to the Fest that crushed me because I actually

06:26.000 --> 06:30.040
like Saturday night after Linux Fest I went to bed like at nine o'clock like oh yeah yeah

06:30.040 --> 06:31.040
we went to the after-party.

06:31.040 --> 06:35.360
The after-party wasn't so good but we went to the after-party and then I left after about

06:35.360 --> 06:40.520
ten minutes and Iamacon shamed me in the chatroom for only having two beers.

06:40.520 --> 06:42.600
It gets worse Iamacon.

06:42.600 --> 06:46.860
After that I went back to the hotel room like around nine o'clock and I fell asleep after

06:46.860 --> 06:50.480
watching Obama's White House Correspondence thing and the rest of the group went out and

06:50.480 --> 06:54.880
had like played the Cards Against Humanity and where that was up to like one in the morning

06:54.880 --> 06:59.400
and meanwhile I'm sleeping I'm saying even though I went to bed early I still didn't

06:59.400 --> 07:00.400
get enough sleep.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.400
I don't know what it is Matt.

07:01.400 --> 07:06.720
So today today we're gonna cover some of the best interviews we got from the floor of Linux

07:06.720 --> 07:08.440
Fest Northwest 2015.

07:08.440 --> 07:11.560
If you watch the Linux action show you saw the interviews we got live as people stopped

07:11.560 --> 07:16.760
by the booth during the show but Linux Fest Northwest went Saturday and Sunday and it's

07:16.760 --> 07:21.120
something it's sort of a phenomenon that happens at these fest is the sessions let out and

07:21.120 --> 07:27.040
man it is like a herd of people just they swarm the floor and it gets nuts and then

07:27.040 --> 07:32.360
it kind of sessions fill back up and the floor kind of empties out and all of the cool people

07:32.360 --> 07:35.820
that are sitting at the different booths all of a sudden have nothing to do and so they

07:35.820 --> 07:40.000
stopped by our booths and they talked to us and so we sat down with Alan of course Alan

07:40.000 --> 07:44.620
from TechSnap he's gonna give us an update on the state of ZFS on Linux and describe

07:44.620 --> 07:47.160
how boot volumes work for us.

07:47.160 --> 07:51.200
Also a guy from Intel who's working on getting the Intel Minnow board to be a premier Linux

07:51.200 --> 07:55.640
device and he talks about why Linux is just the best platform for these Intel Minnow boards.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.920
These are these boards that are designed to compete with like the ARM type boards.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.980
It's really fascinating because it's what you get from an ARM board like a Raspberry

08:01.980 --> 08:07.080
Pi but an x86 chip on there like a full-fledged Intel chip so he's gonna talk to us about

08:07.080 --> 08:11.960
that and running Linux and then the guy who brought Netflix to Linux originally and got

08:11.960 --> 08:17.440
the whole snowball rolling that eventually brought native playback joins us to talk about

08:17.440 --> 08:21.920
all of that and wine's critical role in moving people over to Linux.

08:21.920 --> 08:25.760
Plus towards the end of the show we might just have a clip that could land us in a bit

08:25.760 --> 08:26.840
of legal trouble.

08:26.840 --> 08:31.760
So it is a great show today and audio or video there's gonna be a little something for Irver

08:31.760 --> 08:32.760
Bottom Matt.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.680
So why don't we start getting into it before we go too far we got to bring in our awesome

08:35.680 --> 08:46.400
mumble room so time appropriate greetings mumble room like a wave of yeah it's like

08:46.400 --> 08:50.720
doing the wave a little bit all right guys well you guys are like our virtual Linux fest

08:50.720 --> 08:54.640
every single week who needs to go anywhere we'll just talk to you guys that's not that's

08:54.640 --> 08:59.440
not actually true at all that's not true no it's not true but it doesn't matter hey so

08:59.440 --> 09:03.720
we have many things to cover but I had one story that just kind of slipped out between

09:03.720 --> 09:08.500
Linux action show and this show that I wanted to give some coverage to because it's a pretty

09:08.500 --> 09:13.680
good release and it's one I've been looking forward to for a little while now excuse me

09:13.680 --> 09:19.040
I'm mr. sis I'm getting an echo back from your mic over there thank you sir all right

09:19.040 --> 09:22.160
so it's a it's a it's a news release that I've been looking forward to for a while it's

09:22.160 --> 09:27.420
plat it's KDE plasma 5 3 this is a big big deal this is a really big release of the plasma

09:27.420 --> 09:31.760
desktop this is one where I think people might want to consider switching to plasma 5 if

09:31.760 --> 09:35.840
you've been holding back and it adds a few new interesting features as well specifically

09:35.840 --> 09:40.600
around enhanced power management and boy did these guys go for it and gals when they decided

09:40.600 --> 09:45.440
to make this feature they've built in a lot of features from Intel's power top application

09:45.440 --> 09:50.960
right into the KDE info GUI Center now Matt if you bring up the like the power management

09:50.960 --> 09:57.120
section in K info center they will now integrate the power top readings right into the graphing

09:57.120 --> 10:02.960
so you can see what applications are consuming the most power and it generates you an energy

10:02.960 --> 10:07.840
consumption graph kind of like you see on Android it's really sick well this pisses

10:07.840 --> 10:12.720
me off because now I want to use KDE again it just totally it's like come on guys stop

10:12.720 --> 10:18.000
it stop innovating damn it I'm trying to like find a desktop and stick to it knock it off

10:18.000 --> 10:23.640
I know I know hold on I just decided I'm a gnome guy don't do this to me right do this

10:23.640 --> 10:28.560
oh wait there's more you know I don't know what this means exactly but also now screen

10:28.560 --> 10:33.680
brightness changes are animated on most hardware I don't know what that means I don't know

10:33.680 --> 10:37.780
how you animate a screen brightness change other than I'm glad it's animated I like that

10:37.780 --> 10:41.960
I know yeah well that could go a couple different ways I mean were we talking about like doing

10:41.960 --> 10:46.240
a Disney cartoon or are we talking about actually like a transition I don't know yeah that could

10:46.240 --> 10:50.680
be interesting it's like an OpenGL fade or yeah or is it something completely different

10:50.680 --> 10:56.200
so they completely revamped the Bluetooth management applet so it looks really good

10:56.200 --> 11:01.040
and much clearer to connect to available Bluetooth devices and the touchpad configuration well

11:01.040 --> 11:05.600
I don't know if I'd say it looks good I mean it's a touchpad configurator but boy is it

11:05.600 --> 11:11.160
cray it'll even emulate little like areas for you to drag and click to test stuff and

11:11.160 --> 11:15.080
set up action corners for like the top left top right bottom right bottom left of your

11:15.080 --> 11:20.580
trackpad you can do tap and drag gestures you can set locked drags and tap detection

11:20.580 --> 11:24.560
timers and all of these things that of course you'd only be able to do under KDE and I'm

11:24.560 --> 11:27.680
not going to say it's the best UI to do it but at the same time I'm glad they're not

11:27.680 --> 11:32.640
taking away some of the power toys so I'll take it that is now see this yeah this changes

11:32.640 --> 11:36.680
everything improved widgets all along to new clipboard applet gain support for showing

11:36.680 --> 11:40.240
barcodes which is kind of crazy but easy to transfer something from your clipboard to

11:40.240 --> 11:44.840
your Android device the recent they now have a recent contacts and recent documents menu

11:44.840 --> 11:48.800
that's been cleaned up the menu whole menu thing looks really that's just the whole thing

11:48.800 --> 11:53.340
looks really good and the tech preview of plasma media center has been added to this

11:53.340 --> 11:57.140
release it's a full it's they say it's fully stable but missing features so version one

11:57.140 --> 12:01.900
will have more features but they say it's stable now wow yeah also a huge steps towards

12:01.900 --> 12:08.120
supporting Wayland so boom shakalaka the plasma desktop keeps chugging right along I mean

12:08.120 --> 12:12.760
like I go out of my way to dislike KDE and I'm having a really hard time right now because

12:12.760 --> 12:17.200
it's like this is really compelling I mean and I'm not a fan so this is saying something

12:17.200 --> 12:21.280
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna dig any I'm not gonna dig a hole any deeper but I'll just

12:21.280 --> 12:27.480
say I'll just give you this I'm impressed yeah there you go hey so we've before before

12:27.480 --> 12:32.640
we even started the show wimpy jumped on and wimpy wimpy asked me said so Chris what's

12:32.640 --> 12:37.920
the latest with Angela switch to Linux how is it going and I thought I would open up

12:37.920 --> 12:44.200
our update on Angela switch to Linux and her whole I switched to a yoga three by capturing

12:44.200 --> 12:48.680
a special moment that happened on the live stream at Linux fest this weekend think penguin

12:48.680 --> 12:53.280
was there and they were giving out stickers for you to place over the Windows key on your

12:53.280 --> 12:57.320
keyboard and so we thought the proper way to Chris and Angela's new laptop was to get

12:57.320 --> 13:01.300
rid of that Windows super key and put a tux penguin on this all open up the yoga update

13:01.300 --> 13:06.360
segment with this clip okay to put that wind that that that tux sticker over the Windows

13:06.360 --> 13:14.200
key or you can use that one if you want yeah there you go if you want to tux that that

13:14.200 --> 13:25.120
Windows button all right the tension no it gets the sticker ready all right as I fold

13:25.120 --> 13:32.720
the yoga screen back I get the power vested in me yeah by the canoe and the penguins and

13:32.720 --> 13:40.280
the beard I now pronounce you no longer freedom hating garbage but instead freedom respecting

13:40.280 --> 13:49.360
that's beautiful though it's so beautiful keyed give me now kissy yoga there we go ladies

13:49.360 --> 13:56.040
and gentlemen it now has a tux somebody better kiss that computer then Noah kisses the computer

13:56.040 --> 14:05.960
not a dry eye was a very emotional moment so now Angela has a Linux penguin on on the

14:05.960 --> 14:13.080
button now okay so what did we end up doing so the MacBook sold thank goodness the MacBook

14:13.080 --> 14:21.840
sold so the yoga is going to be paid for thank goodness now I I left the studio that night

14:21.840 --> 14:25.440
after Linux unplugged and I said to Noah and I wish Noah's here so we could get an answer

14:25.440 --> 14:29.400
and if anybody in the mumble room knows the answer it's mr. sis you might know the answer

14:29.400 --> 14:33.680
I don't know but if anybody or blaster might know I left here thinking that we were gonna

14:33.680 --> 14:39.040
put Ubuntu Mate 1404 we're gonna go LTS and then we sort of you know you know what we'll

14:39.040 --> 14:44.480
do this we'll do LTS and we'll do gnome 314 we'll do the gnome PP because she likes gnome

14:44.480 --> 14:51.360
and all right so we'll do that and one thing led up to another and I don't exactly know

14:51.360 --> 14:56.840
exactly what transpired but I kid you not when I got back in here the next morning it

14:56.840 --> 15:05.400
was running arch he was installing Ubuntu I literally have no idea quite what happened

15:05.400 --> 15:15.440
why we switched from Ubuntu LTS with gnome PPA to arch but we did and so that's what

15:15.440 --> 15:20.240
she has is an arch box with gnome 3.16 on it so far she's quite happy and everything

15:20.240 --> 15:24.680
seems to be working mr. sis do you know why he didn't go with LTS were you in the room

15:24.680 --> 15:30.720
when that decision was made yes I was I was there I was part of the decision I can't confess

15:30.720 --> 15:36.880
to that however there is a non-disclosure agreement that was agreed to at the time so

15:36.880 --> 15:41.680
all members would have to be around to then agree that we can't disclose that decision-making

15:41.680 --> 15:45.680
process okay so before we can reveal the reason we have to bring Noah on the show and get

15:45.680 --> 15:53.840
his consent and maybe Alan too since he was present and and Rekai okay okay I might have

15:53.840 --> 15:59.560
to get consent from Rekai off air perhaps but why this is either way what I want to

15:59.560 --> 16:07.120
focus on is that she actually she said something to me over dinner that made all of the work

16:07.120 --> 16:13.280
worth it she said I think this is the time it's gonna stick because the difference and

16:13.280 --> 16:17.040
I and I want to I want to reiterate and underscore this if you can afford to do it the difference

16:17.040 --> 16:21.200
is she really likes that hardware she likes that laptop she feels like she got something

16:21.200 --> 16:25.800
nice and it is something nice and it's set up just for her and you know we also went

16:25.800 --> 16:29.080
through and cleaned up some of her old data and offline some of it and we just sort of

16:29.080 --> 16:33.880
did some general hygiene stuff as well and I think overall she's missing a few things

16:33.880 --> 16:37.280
and there's a there's a couple of threads going to the Linux action show subreddit like

16:37.280 --> 16:42.800
she used a pixel mater which is sort of like a Photoshop alternative under OS 10 she doesn't

16:42.800 --> 16:47.080
have anything quite equivalent to that she's looking at Corita and Inkscape not I don't

16:47.080 --> 16:50.040
know if that's gonna do it for her not but there's threads going on and on about that

16:50.040 --> 16:59.280
but so far it looks like it's actually gonna stick and I don't know I'm not I'm not like

16:59.280 --> 17:02.840
totally like totally comfortable with the arch thing but I since we were gonna do before

17:02.840 --> 17:07.180
and I was okay with it I'm okay with it now I'll stay on top of it for a little bit I

17:07.180 --> 17:13.800
guess delegate my friend delegate I'm telling you oh we got to get that reason we got to

17:13.800 --> 17:18.960
get that reason in here and find it out or you know or Linux Academy you know I mean

17:18.960 --> 17:23.120
one of the other either way actually she was she was also I think this whole thing has

17:23.120 --> 17:26.460
given her a boost of confidence because then she was kind of giving me a hard time teasing

17:26.460 --> 17:31.920
me that she was gonna learn Python before I do so my wife's enrolling in Linux Academy

17:31.920 --> 17:35.040
next month I mean it's happening yeah she's actually gonna learn the Linux basics I mean

17:35.040 --> 17:39.920
you know I think I'm just gonna do it too and yeah it is it is you know actually this

17:39.920 --> 17:42.720
would be I could just why don't I just take a moment right here and I'll just mention

17:42.720 --> 17:46.720
Linux Academy that'd be a great spot to mention Linux Academy they're a sponsor of the Linux

17:46.720 --> 17:51.480
unplugged program go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged that'll get you the unplugged

17:51.480 --> 17:56.200
discount that's linuxacademy.com slash unplugged go check them out they have been sponsoring

17:56.200 --> 18:01.000
us for a while now but I feel like every time we come on the show we have something new

18:01.000 --> 18:05.460
to talk about and that's pretty exciting if you think about the rapid amount of innovation

18:05.460 --> 18:11.080
and development work that is required to make that happen wow that I have right here let's

18:11.080 --> 18:14.840
see check out I have printed off some of the stuff they've done recently it's so much stuff

18:14.840 --> 18:17.720
that I actually decided I'm just gonna print it so that way I can just go through some

18:17.720 --> 18:21.680
of it with you from time to time and read it that it's I really really respect what

18:21.680 --> 18:24.720
these guys are doing so let me tell you a little about Linux Academy they're different

18:24.720 --> 18:29.120
than all the other online educational resources it's created by people that are truly passionate

18:29.120 --> 18:33.220
about Linux and they really care about open source they got together with their friends

18:33.220 --> 18:38.040
that are education education educators and developers and they've created the Linux Academy

18:38.040 --> 18:44.100
platform they built it from scratch and it is custom-built for us when you go there you

18:44.100 --> 18:47.780
recognize it is created by people that truly get this kind of thing and the reason why

18:47.780 --> 18:51.120
I want to emphasize that is because I think that really closes the gap that makes the

18:51.120 --> 18:54.600
big difference that's the difference from all of the other large websites that cover

18:54.600 --> 18:58.160
all of the other areas that don't truly love Linux they don't cover it right they don't

18:58.160 --> 19:02.560
care they don't closely watch the trends and see where things are going they don't know

19:02.560 --> 19:05.960
that there's many distributions you might want to choose from Linux Academy does they

19:05.960 --> 19:09.400
have seven plus Linux distributions you get to choose from that automatically adjust the

19:09.400 --> 19:12.920
course where that automatically adjust the virtual machine that spins up on-demand it

19:12.920 --> 19:17.800
comes with the machines as you need them they have scenario based labs at Linux Academy

19:17.800 --> 19:21.120
in addition to all the other regular labs they have for servers and things like that

19:21.120 --> 19:25.120
they'll do specific deep dives into scenarios we receive access to scenario based training

19:25.120 --> 19:28.640
to put you in the middle of a task common to everyday environments you'll work in advanced

19:28.640 --> 19:32.960
lab environments while completing those scenarios from beginning to end on their live servers

19:32.960 --> 19:36.460
as a member of Linux Academy also have abilities to ask their instructors they have live streams

19:36.460 --> 19:39.880
where you can ask the instructors questions and they've introduced this new feature just

19:39.880 --> 19:43.500
recently called nuggets which is a deep dive into a single topic not necessarily part of

19:43.500 --> 19:48.360
an overall part of a training course but like everyday tasks that you just need to know

19:48.360 --> 19:52.120
that if you know these little nuggets better and better you get things done faster and

19:52.120 --> 19:56.120
faster and I've taken some of these and learned you know there's a better way to do this that

19:56.120 --> 20:00.000
I've always done it and it's a little bit of humble pie from time to time but I'm always

20:00.000 --> 20:04.200
very very very grateful that I've learned a new way to do something or improved a way

20:04.200 --> 20:09.080
of doing something I've done for a long time Linux Academy also recently announced they're

20:09.080 --> 20:15.120
going to start up an open source grant they're going to be giving away five thousand dollars

20:15.120 --> 20:19.060
to a qualifying open source project now to qualify you have to be an open source project

20:19.060 --> 20:23.040
now they're going to have their founders club members vote on which projects get the funding

20:23.040 --> 20:26.200
but it's pretty awesome it's a way it's another way they're going to give back to the open

20:26.200 --> 20:31.440
source community so they had their big content push bunch of new content has hit Linux Academy

20:31.440 --> 20:37.280
the Red Hat certified services administrator the art I chat room you tell me our HCSA it's

20:37.280 --> 20:40.900
going to be released it was actually just released a couple of days ago 50 new video

20:40.900 --> 20:44.840
nuggets you know those new nuggets I was telling you about 50 of them just hit the site how

20:44.840 --> 20:48.720
about that AWS CSA Pro available for the founders club members and then everybody else gets

20:48.720 --> 20:54.160
it on June 15th DevOps essentials is available now that was just added as well lots of good

20:54.160 --> 20:58.720
stuff as well as new office hours tons and tons of things in the community as well and

20:58.720 --> 21:03.200
if you want to learn things like Ruby or OpenStack PHP Amazon Web Services Android development

21:03.200 --> 21:07.240
or just how to back up your Linux box go to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and take

21:07.240 --> 21:11.480
the training courses go do a deep dive download the comprehensive study guides listen to them

21:11.480 --> 21:16.080
offline when you're going like a podcast get the in-depth resources it's training materials

21:16.080 --> 21:21.120
for the stuff that you need to use stuff to make you better at the job that you do or

21:21.120 --> 21:25.360
challenge yourself that's what I use it for Linux Academy comm slash unplugged it's a

21:25.360 --> 21:31.120
great resource and a big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux unplugged program

21:31.120 --> 21:35.040
and like you know like Matt said there's always a great opportunity to go in there for all

21:35.040 --> 21:39.080
kinds of folks I don't get a chance to really give you a picture of all the types of content

21:39.080 --> 21:42.400
that are available but if you go check it out there really is courseware for everybody

21:42.400 --> 21:46.120
it's starting sort of at the absolute beginner level like like maybe Matt's wife would be

21:46.120 --> 21:49.960
all the way up to you know the really hardcore stuff that's super advanced and putting you

21:49.960 --> 21:56.280
on the very edge of the things like Docker and and really just everything that I was

21:56.280 --> 22:01.960
looking at some of the recently added stuff here engine X and the limp stack introduction

22:01.960 --> 22:05.960
to Ruby on Linux Linux essential certification course for just all the different certifications

22:05.960 --> 22:10.820
right there new 20 new AWS CSA additions were just put on here get in GitLab from start

22:10.820 --> 22:16.200
to finish deploy and manage open stack on Ubuntu it just it's just these are just recent

22:16.200 --> 22:21.640
ones that's just really good stuff Linux Academy comm slash unplugged thanks like you said there's

22:21.640 --> 22:24.500
something there for everyone and I love the fact that they're able to take you by the

22:24.500 --> 22:28.960
hand at the very very beginning and you know you can know literally nothing about Linux

22:28.960 --> 22:32.360
at all and they can take you from that point all the way up to where you're ready to be

22:32.360 --> 22:35.400
certified and something you're wanting to get into it's really cool and there's for

22:35.400 --> 22:38.760
folks like me who've been in it for a long time but just want to kind of just keep tipping

22:38.760 --> 22:42.780
our toes and keeping keeping ourselves up to date exactly it's really useful and speaking

22:42.780 --> 22:47.680
of keeping our toes in the waters I've been experimenting with different file systems

22:47.680 --> 22:50.640
under Linux for a while the one I really haven't spent a lot of time with because just doesn't

22:50.640 --> 22:55.000
feel like it's time yet but maybe it maybe this clip is going to change my mind is ZFS

22:55.000 --> 23:01.380
or as our buddy Alan says ZFS and Alan gave a talk at Linux Fest Northwest about open

23:01.380 --> 23:04.800
ZFS and he talked about a lot of things and one of the things that seemed to grab the

23:04.800 --> 23:08.880
crowd's attention was this feature called boot volumes and it goes into some detail

23:08.880 --> 23:12.460
about how it works and how maybe we could see it under Linux and how maybe in the future

23:12.460 --> 23:16.680
it could be integrated with docker so a lot of things that could be coming to Linux and

23:16.680 --> 23:24.000
ZFS so Alan is our first take from Linux Fest Northwest did did you go into much much detail

23:24.000 --> 23:27.120
on boot environments because that seems like in a particular area that would be of interest

23:27.120 --> 23:31.960
to Linux users yeah they're all like we want that yeah so one of the things we do with

23:31.960 --> 23:36.720
that is so instead of actually take snapshots that's pretty normal but you can also clone

23:36.720 --> 23:40.120
them which basically makes them a new file system that's writeable not for our default

23:40.120 --> 23:44.480
file system we don't we don't have snapshots no no yeah so yeah but there people are familiar

23:44.480 --> 23:47.880
with what snapshots are you mean better file systems that have snapshots yeah yeah okay

23:47.880 --> 23:52.080
but but people are familiar that there's such a thing yeah like even if even if it's actually

23:52.080 --> 23:55.680
coming from even if our file system doesn't have it right or specifically you know you're

23:55.680 --> 23:59.840
using virtualization and it can kind of pretend right yeah sometimes I get to play like extended

23:59.840 --> 24:03.560
for as snapshots with like virtual box yeah and I'm like oh this is what a file system

24:03.560 --> 24:08.240
feels like yeah a little bit just a little bit and so you basically with a clone it allows

24:08.240 --> 24:12.520
you to like fork a file system kind of like you for open source right yeah so you have

24:12.520 --> 24:16.200
the common blocks only take up space once even though you're using them twice and then

24:16.200 --> 24:19.760
the differences in the difference yeah and then you have the differences take up the

24:19.760 --> 24:23.680
space and so with that what you can do is if you have forks of what your system looked

24:23.680 --> 24:28.800
like from different times you we push that into the grub menu and when you start up the

24:28.800 --> 24:34.000
system what publishes it to the grub menu just a utility that Chris Moore wrote oh okay

24:34.000 --> 24:39.320
so it just loops over the ZFS data set and reads that and then it figures out what menu

24:39.320 --> 24:43.320
entries to make based on and then when you boot up the system you may like well I can

24:43.320 --> 24:47.800
have the system that like the latest version I run it it's okay or I just installed an

24:47.800 --> 24:51.040
update and it broke everything yeah let me just select the other one in the menu one

24:51.040 --> 24:57.360
from before yeah and he set it up so it automatically makes one for you when you start a package

24:57.360 --> 25:03.360
upgrade because I always forget that's a good idea and then oh look you know this latest

25:03.360 --> 25:08.120
package upgrade left me in dependency hell some app I depend on doesn't work now yeah

25:08.120 --> 25:12.720
well hey I can just reboot and give me what my machine looked like 10 minutes ago or and

25:12.720 --> 25:17.440
the best part about it is with ZFS you create basically an infinite number of partitions

25:17.440 --> 25:21.960
you can create many many partitions but they all share one pool of free space right because

25:21.960 --> 25:25.920
usually the the only reason we don't create a separate partition for like every directory

25:25.920 --> 25:29.960
on our systems is that you have to set how much space each partition gets and you lock

25:29.960 --> 25:33.600
yourself in yeah your free space gets broken up all over the place and it's useless yeah

25:33.600 --> 25:38.000
well with all the free space coming from one big pool now you can create as many as you

25:38.000 --> 25:42.760
want and so when you're setting up these snapshots and stuff when you're rolling back you can

25:42.760 --> 25:48.320
say roll back only the system but leave my home directory alone oh all the documents

25:48.320 --> 25:53.780
I updated but the files and can I can I once again repeat that extended for is not good

25:53.780 --> 25:57.960
enough and I just say once again repeat that every time you've tried another file system

25:57.960 --> 26:01.840
it totally blows your system away and I've run extended for for the last like seven years

26:01.840 --> 26:06.240
never had a problem working for you know I don't have snapshots my system doesn't crash

26:06.240 --> 26:13.200
so we'll go with that honestly on my development laptop I actually have boot environments

26:13.200 --> 26:16.120
are created on purpose where I'm actually have three different versions of the operating

26:16.120 --> 26:20.960
system that I can boot from yeah that's cool too but sharing more of the data rather than

26:20.960 --> 26:25.840
if I did it like a multi boot type setup right yeah like they're all sharing the same installed

26:25.840 --> 26:30.000
apps and stuff because they're sharing their package database because it's compatible but

26:30.000 --> 26:35.400
the one thing that makes this a little easier on BSD is the separation between the operating

26:35.400 --> 26:40.160
system and your applications yeah previously forces all applications you install from the

26:40.160 --> 26:45.760
package repo to be rooted in user local whatever right so even your config files so you know

26:45.760 --> 26:50.120
yeah the config files user local Etsy is user local Etsy yeah so when you upgrade the operating

26:50.120 --> 26:54.920
system and it changes some default stuff right changes an etc right so you can your snapshot

26:54.920 --> 26:59.840
can have that separate and yeah you can see which last etc is just the OS setting exactly

26:59.840 --> 27:05.080
and so when you're upgrading and and if you roll that back yeah you didn't lose the change

27:05.080 --> 27:09.480
you made yeah in your server application or whatever yeah you know and Linux sometimes

27:09.480 --> 27:13.680
like apps that run with the user level privileges they'll write their config to the home directory

27:13.680 --> 27:17.720
so you can accomplish that a bit yeah but like yeah overall package settings and like

27:17.720 --> 27:21.000
you know for your for your applications you install from like the AUR and things like

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
that yeah they get mixed in with the slash Etsy yeah so having that separation makes

27:25.000 --> 27:30.040
things a little bit easier to kind of with finding control decide exactly what you're

27:30.040 --> 27:33.360
going to roll back and what you're not yeah and that that's the the other big advantage

27:33.360 --> 27:38.800
with that over other types of snapshots and roll backs is that you can roll back part

27:38.800 --> 27:43.520
of the system but not all of it so that you know you don't lose the file you're the stuff

27:43.520 --> 27:49.760
you're doing well and yeah so with that what PCB SD is taken to doing is actually basically

27:49.760 --> 27:54.360
forking the file system setting up in a jail and installing all the updates and stuff in

27:54.360 --> 27:58.000
the background while you're working on your live system and then when you reboot you just

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
reboot in a newer version of the system but all you're in this all your other stuff is

28:02.000 --> 28:05.960
happening and and so you can be doing your package upgrade in the background while still

28:05.960 --> 28:09.960
running applications without having a problem because that was a problem I used to have

28:09.960 --> 28:13.040
is like while I was installing the update you know it's downloading a button it's going

28:13.040 --> 28:17.760
to do stuff well I want to be using the browser but how do you use the browser well the dependencies

28:17.760 --> 28:22.120
are being upgraded yeah it's like oh the browser can't launch because the dependency is a newer

28:22.120 --> 28:26.760
version now yeah and so yeah having that happen in a separate one and then just switching

28:26.760 --> 28:32.640
out underneath right it's kind of like a puppy Linux and having the overlay yeah yeah overlay

28:32.640 --> 28:37.760
so it the way I look at it and and really I mean people as much as it's fun to joke

28:37.760 --> 28:41.160
about it really people should be thanking you for trying things like butter FS and then

28:41.160 --> 28:44.520
letting it crash on you twice because then we all know where you know what the state

28:44.520 --> 28:49.800
of I mean really you're doing everyone a favor by by actually I'm not serious but then but

28:49.800 --> 28:56.800
you add to that in building upon that then we look at this idea that if if I would rather

28:56.800 --> 29:00.200
see Linux get to a point where Linux does everything well and we can all that stuff

29:00.200 --> 29:05.520
sounds really great and fancy and cool but I'm thankful for for a reliable usable file

29:05.520 --> 29:09.680
system like exe for that I have and I can fall back on that that I don't lose any data

29:09.680 --> 29:15.840
on and if and when Linux can adopt those things I think it'll be really cool there is there

29:15.840 --> 29:21.600
is ZFS on Linux it's a project from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories right and

29:21.600 --> 29:27.240
while they're a little bit behind BSD and a Lumos mostly because they started much later

29:27.240 --> 29:31.160
and they have a lot of catching up to do but their latest release I think is 0.6 up for

29:31.160 --> 29:36.800
it has the biggest improvements like the compression stuff and it's it's quite stable and people

29:36.800 --> 29:40.440
are using it and they're quite happy with it I'm waiting for a checkbox in the installer

29:40.440 --> 29:46.040
that I can just check and says yes at a fast ironically Debian might be the first yeah

29:46.040 --> 29:51.960
that'd be really cool yeah there's a I forget the name of the project but there's one that's

29:51.960 --> 29:57.840
looking at Docker and ZFS put together and being able to do interesting things there

29:57.840 --> 30:02.040
is some interesting things you could do there now a lot of you probably out in the audience

30:02.040 --> 30:05.160
might have already tried ZFS into Linux or some of you might be doing it now wimpy didn't

30:05.160 --> 30:09.680
you say on the pre-show that you recently set up a NAS with ZFS just this afternoon

30:09.680 --> 30:17.480
oh wow that is recent and is I assume Linux based right it is it's open media vault 1.0

30:17.480 --> 30:24.520
which is Debbie and Weezy based oh yes and that has a plug-in that adds ZFS support there's

30:24.520 --> 30:31.040
a storage back end with the management utilities to support it as well so the OS is what extended

30:31.040 --> 30:38.680
for and then the data volumes are ZFS that's right so I've got a next for OS drive and

30:38.680 --> 30:48.520
then four drives in ZFS pool and how's the management UI for it I'm something of a newbie

30:48.520 --> 30:54.000
with ZFS so I don't know how comprehensive it is but I was able to set up what I wanted

30:54.000 --> 31:03.840
to do so from a new to ZFS point of view it does what I need and I don't know if it's

31:03.840 --> 31:07.720
going to be stable or not or if it'll work or if it'll fall in a heap but it's an experiment

31:07.720 --> 31:12.880
to try it out do you do you recall is it a pretty current version of ZFS that they're

31:12.880 --> 31:24.160
using it's compatible with the feature flags that are in free nas 9.2 so I don't know what

31:24.160 --> 31:32.540
changed in ZFS between free nas 9.2 and 9.3 right but if you but you can find free nas

31:32.540 --> 31:38.760
yeah yeah you can find a feature flag system works is that would be that'd be true across

31:38.760 --> 31:44.800
any any system that has ZFS with those feature flags it wouldn't just be free nas yeah so

31:44.800 --> 31:53.120
I know that you can import a Z pull that's from free nas 9.2 into this open media vault

31:53.120 --> 31:59.880
system but I don't think you can import a Z pull from free nas 9.3 because the required

31:59.880 --> 32:08.360
feature flags aren't in open ZFS in this Linux implementation yet any initial impressions

32:08.360 --> 32:14.120
on performance well I haven't done it for the performance so this is this is going to

32:14.120 --> 32:21.180
be my Plex server I've really done it to help prevent bit rot and gray holing so your requirements

32:21.180 --> 32:26.960
are stream the HD file fast enough yes just fast enough to get downstairs to the TV yeah

32:26.960 --> 32:32.040
that makes sense I'm still curious though for some reason like I like to know I don't

32:32.040 --> 32:34.720
know I just kind of want to get a sense of what the performance would be like under Linux

32:34.720 --> 32:40.920
yeah well I'm gonna go ahead I will compare that I've got two systems that are identical

32:40.920 --> 32:46.400
ones so they're running the same OS they've got the same hardware same drives runs running

32:46.400 --> 32:54.840
on LVM with XFS over the top and this one's now got ZFS and I will do some sort of finger

32:54.840 --> 33:00.160
in the air kind of benchmarks but performance isn't my main requirement it's really yeah

33:00.160 --> 33:05.920
about date data quality is really what it's about and that totally that totally does make

33:05.920 --> 33:11.100
sense and that's I mean that's why we use it on our NAS here Kitson is it I don't think

33:11.100 --> 33:15.160
it's it is fair to say that ZFS has no more legal concerns necessarily where do you get

33:15.160 --> 33:22.520
that well the Debian team seemed to have analyzed it and if it is good enough for Debian shouldn't

33:22.520 --> 33:27.800
it be good enough for open Susie or fedora I'm wondering how how how did they come to

33:27.800 --> 33:32.680
this conclusion so it appears to me that they got a consultation from either the free software

33:32.680 --> 33:38.880
conservancy or the I'm not actually I don't remember actually who they got their cons

33:38.880 --> 33:41.960
I remember talking about the story now but I'm trying to remember who they got the details

33:41.960 --> 33:49.340
on but if I recall it essentially sounds like Debian as a project might be able to license

33:49.340 --> 33:54.840
it or something is kind of what I was gathering not so much that the legal status has changed

33:54.840 --> 33:58.680
yeah here it is I'm pulling up the article on Phronix right now as we talk about it here

33:58.680 --> 34:02.520
it is he says Neil McGovern he was he's elected as a Debian project leader and as the former

34:02.520 --> 34:07.120
project leader was stepping out he posted his final remarks and his formal formal project

34:07.120 --> 34:12.640
leader was Lucas his final management he said we received legal advice from the software

34:12.640 --> 34:16.700
freedom law center there it is the software freedom law center about the inclusion of

34:16.700 --> 34:20.600
lib DVD CSS so that's the DVD decryption stuff because oh we're all clamping at the bit for

34:20.600 --> 34:25.560
that still and our champ what is that what is that chomping at the bit or and then of

34:25.560 --> 34:29.600
course ZFS and Debian which should unblock the situation of both cases and enables to

34:29.600 --> 34:36.080
ship them in Debian soon we've received legal advice about the inclusion they say that's

34:36.080 --> 34:42.000
pretty ambiguous I don't know what the hell that means well I think at some basic level

34:42.000 --> 34:46.200
it indicates that rather than just looking at it strictly from an engineering point of

34:46.200 --> 34:50.400
view or a software point of view they actually got a hold of someone that has studied law

34:50.400 --> 34:55.680
and at some some inherent level and has actually looked at it from can you know what is the

34:55.680 --> 34:59.760
likelihood of a successful lawsuit on this that's that's what exactly what it sounds

34:59.760 --> 35:04.640
like to me and it sounds like it's a copyright aggregation agreement with the software freedom

35:04.640 --> 35:08.360
Conservancy that's where I got software freedom Conservancy from the Debian project and the

35:08.360 --> 35:12.040
software freedom Conservancy have now now have an agreement that enables Debian contributors

35:12.040 --> 35:17.640
to assign copyright of their works to the Conservancy a couple of the DDs already expressed

35:17.640 --> 35:21.040
interest in some time ago and if you're interested to please get in contact blah blah blah so

35:21.040 --> 35:27.080
that's one thing that came in and I have no idea if that has any relation now to the ZFS

35:27.080 --> 35:31.640
but it sounds like to me man I think it sounds like to you Debian seeked out some legal advice

35:31.640 --> 35:36.000
specifically for the project themselves and got the legal advice that they could include

35:36.000 --> 35:42.800
ZFS not ZFS was legal for Linux to use license wise across the board right I think that's

35:42.800 --> 35:47.600
exactly it yeah yeah Darrell did you know did you have something you want to add about

35:47.600 --> 35:52.960
the license yeah just looking at the perspective that the GPL still complies with the BSD license

35:52.960 --> 35:59.360
there's no technical reason to like legally speaking that is by in violation of the BSD

35:59.360 --> 36:05.920
license in that case so the common scenario in warring is mostly related to shipping by

36:05.920 --> 36:11.680
default with it and also how to make GPL not contaminate the BSD code so to do that you

36:11.680 --> 36:18.200
kind of have to make an exception while releasing the software on your GPL license so I'm guessing

36:18.200 --> 36:24.320
that these that you just mentioned and this is me guessing is the assigning to this institution

36:24.320 --> 36:31.720
allows that institution to make that grant right ability to ship with that code without

36:31.720 --> 36:36.640
GPL contaminating that code if that makes sense that does make sense it's well it makes

36:36.640 --> 36:43.760
as much sense as I think it's gonna make sense to me which is good enough so and then I know

36:43.760 --> 36:46.400
a lot of you out there they're listening right now are smashing your heads against the keyboard

36:46.400 --> 36:51.200
saying guys guys guys oh yeah right ZFS is not BSD license yes I know I know a lot of

36:51.200 --> 36:54.040
you out there smashing against the keyboard saying guys I've been using ZFS on Linux for

36:54.040 --> 36:58.560
years Jed for example which we'll have an interview in one of our shows soon is using

36:58.560 --> 37:04.600
in large-scale production well I'll talk more about Jed in a little bit right ZFS was created

37:04.600 --> 37:11.160
by son it's a the CD DL or whatever the hell that is I know you're using it so I'd like

37:11.160 --> 37:14.880
to hear it but if you could do a post for me so that way we could get a discussion going

37:14.880 --> 37:18.100
on the Linux action show subreddit that would be extremely valuable if you've got a really

37:18.100 --> 37:22.260
awesome setup I wouldn't mind I could I mean I know this is asking for a lot but like a

37:22.260 --> 37:25.320
diagram or something like that you could post it over there just so we could take a look

37:25.320 --> 37:32.040
at it it's Linux action show dot reddit calm I'd like to talk more about it just because

37:32.040 --> 37:35.640
it's something that we're gonna have to tackle here in production I think it's something

37:35.640 --> 37:39.480
we're gonna have to face at JP so basically it's a necessity it's about to come about

37:39.480 --> 37:42.300
you're gonna have to basically do what I feel like I feel like I have just a little bit

37:42.300 --> 37:45.980
of time to before I have to tackle it so I'd like to really I just like to give what people

37:45.980 --> 37:49.280
have to say yeah oh and this would allow you to benefit from other people's experiences

37:49.280 --> 37:54.480
their successes and their failures hey we've got a we've got a lot more coming up including

37:54.480 --> 37:57.640
the Intel middleboard guy which is a fascinating conversation but first I want to tell you

37:57.640 --> 38:05.480
about our second sponsor and that's Ting go over to Linux dot ting dot com why Linux

38:05.480 --> 38:09.000
dot ting dot com well I mean what are you gonna put Windows dot ting dot com in your

38:09.000 --> 38:13.680
browser I don't why would you ask me a silly question like that oh no I Linux dot ting

38:13.680 --> 38:16.780
dot com it supports this show and it's gonna get you twenty five dollars off your first

38:16.780 --> 38:21.320
device and if you already have a ting compatible device and you probably do well then they'll

38:21.320 --> 38:24.720
give you twenty five dollars in service card that paid for more than my first month my

38:24.720 --> 38:31.200
first month of what ting what is ting oh well I'm glad you asked ting is truly finally mobile

38:31.200 --> 38:34.720
that makes sense and nobody can beat them people others have tried there you got people

38:34.720 --> 38:37.600
to think they're the uncare here and as long as you wear a pink shirt and a leather jacket

38:37.600 --> 38:40.840
that's all you need to sell phones apparently and then other people think that they can

38:40.840 --> 38:46.120
just roll into the wireless industry but yet still fail to understand that people don't

38:46.120 --> 38:51.940
want to have to pay per device I got too many devices see if you keep making all these cool

38:51.940 --> 38:56.640
things I'm gonna buy them like tablets and watches and phones and multiple phones I got

38:56.640 --> 39:00.800
too many phones and I'm not gonna pay for data and a contract for every single stinking

39:00.800 --> 39:06.720
device I'm not crazy so I switched to ting I go to Linux dot ting dot com no contract

39:06.720 --> 39:10.840
no early termination fee yeah no contract you only pay for what you use it's a flat

39:10.840 --> 39:15.960
six dollars for the line six bucks so I've got three phones I pay six dollars no that

39:15.960 --> 39:19.920
crazy SOP he's got like five or six phones on there you know and if you're a small business

39:19.920 --> 39:23.720
you've got more than ten lines it's seriously a no-brainer because it's only six dollars

39:23.720 --> 39:27.640
and then you just pay for your usage well I'm on Wi-Fi all the time so no bigs I hardly

39:27.640 --> 39:32.260
have any data usage and I hardly have any minutes used up so for three lines I'm paying

39:32.260 --> 39:36.560
like forty dollars a month it's absolutely outrageous they just take your minutes your

39:36.560 --> 39:41.020
messages and your megabytes they add them up and that's what you pay and then it's really

39:41.020 --> 39:44.080
as simple as that if you have any questions you ever get stuck you call one eight five

39:44.080 --> 39:48.680
five ting FTW and a real human being answers the phone I've never needed to do that though

39:48.680 --> 39:53.200
why because their dashboard freakin rocks nobody has anything on the ting dashboard

39:53.200 --> 39:59.240
you can do everything you need including disabling devices transferring devices activating a

39:59.240 --> 40:04.240
device setting up alerts all these kinds of features it's really nice because if you don't

40:04.240 --> 40:06.960
need a device for a little bit you can just turn it off that's really great like if you

40:06.960 --> 40:11.280
go get one of those my fi access points if you don't need it for a little bit just turn

40:11.280 --> 40:15.040
it off and you can do it right there in the ting dashboard go to linux.ting.com you get

40:15.040 --> 40:20.840
a $25 discount if you have a GSM or CDMA compatible device that works on ting because they take

40:20.840 --> 40:24.560
both now they'll give you a $25 service credit and that's pretty awesome because that paid

40:24.560 --> 40:28.520
for more than my first month and I got a couple of devices you might want to check out they've

40:28.520 --> 40:34.820
have a whole range but I just picked a couple out here first one is this I just I can't

40:34.820 --> 40:38.800
believe they're gonna I figure this is gonna go fast but if you go to linux.ting.com you

40:38.800 --> 40:47.960
can get an unlocked Moto G for $91 ooh that's that's an amazing Android phone it's like

40:47.960 --> 40:53.160
one of the it's I think it's running that Android 4.4 later and it's a well-built phone

40:53.160 --> 40:59.200
people really like the Moto G it's very well reviewed $91 no contract pay for what you

40:59.200 --> 41:04.200
use that's you own that right there that's not the contract price that $91 is you own

41:04.200 --> 41:07.840
it that's just a crazy outrageous great deal you can also get the ting GSM SIM card and

41:07.840 --> 41:12.680
put it anything that takes a GSM SIM for $9 and then it's just $6 after that I'll go check

41:12.680 --> 41:17.520
out all the great devices they got everything from a $47 feature phone all the way up to

41:17.520 --> 41:22.580
the Nexus 6 they got it all and on their blog they also have tips like saving battery and

41:22.580 --> 41:28.900
Android 5.0 very very helpful well I'll tell you when it comes to saving battery stuff

41:28.900 --> 41:32.700
anytime I can get tips on that means I have an opportunity not to deal with that I mean

41:32.700 --> 41:38.840
that's a beautiful thing all right go over to linux.ting.com check them out and if you

41:38.840 --> 41:44.120
have any questions give them a call 1-855-TING-FTW I've been using them for I'm going over like

41:44.120 --> 41:47.760
I'm thinking like two years about two years and two months in two years and three months

41:47.760 --> 41:53.880
in or so so I'm about $2,200 in on my total savings by switching to Ting yeah $2,200 so

41:53.880 --> 41:57.640
go check out much you would save click that savings calculator linux.ting.com click that

41:57.640 --> 42:03.800
savings calculator thank you very much Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged all right guys

42:03.800 --> 42:10.360
so I want to get into this Intel Minnow interview it's very interesting because I think we get

42:10.360 --> 42:15.780
very excited because the Raspberry Pi is very affordable we get very excited because there's

42:15.780 --> 42:19.480
a lot going on in that space with ARM processors there's a lot of different boards to choose

42:19.480 --> 42:27.200
from it's not just the Raspberry Pi I'm gonna admit though the comfort of x86 is appealing

42:27.200 --> 42:31.080
to me in this space if I could get that same form factor and that same power savings but

42:31.080 --> 42:36.240
run my x86 stuff that appeals to me so when John sat down from Intel to talk about the

42:36.240 --> 42:40.080
Minnow board I was excited to see what they have and what he thought the reason was that

42:40.080 --> 42:44.000
not a lot of people are talking about them compared to all of the other ARM based projects

42:44.000 --> 42:50.840
out there and so we have John here and John you said you're at the Minnow board project

42:50.840 --> 42:56.880
yeah I'm with the Minnow board project Minnow board's an open hardware platform that's being

42:56.880 --> 43:03.760
jointly done between Intel and some industry partners to kind of put an Intel face into

43:03.760 --> 43:07.560
the embedded world we've got I mean if you look at the embedded world and everything

43:07.560 --> 43:14.040
it's dominated by ARM and you know from the Intel perspective we don't exactly make it

43:14.040 --> 43:17.920
easy to work with us I mean if you're gonna buy like a million chips from us we help you

43:17.920 --> 43:21.800
out all over the place but we don't really have or we haven't had a lot of really good

43:21.800 --> 43:26.000
open hardware platforms that people can just kind of pick up with and tinker and thus was

43:26.000 --> 43:30.520
born the Minnow board project so one of the things that I really know I really liked was

43:30.520 --> 43:36.200
I was at LinuxCon two years ago and you guys had a Minnow board demo and they gave everyone

43:36.200 --> 43:40.800
a Minnow board and let us actually set the whole thing like unbox it play with it and

43:40.800 --> 43:45.280
we got to make LEDs flash and here's the thing is it sad that like this is the difference

43:45.280 --> 43:49.680
between between and I'm gonna go there I'm gonna say the difference between a traditional

43:49.680 --> 43:55.520
Mac users and traditional Linux users and that is that that most most people that that

43:55.520 --> 43:59.320
that appeal to that Apple ecosystem want just something handed to them into work and I got

43:59.320 --> 44:02.480
this Minnow board and I was like blown away I'm like I could hook this up to my freaking

44:02.480 --> 44:07.240
garage door SSH into my garage door when I get home yeah like that makes no sense to

44:07.240 --> 44:10.320
most Mac users because they would say well that that's silly why would you just not want

44:10.320 --> 44:12.840
to push the button and then the garage door will open I'm like but it's much cooler to

44:12.840 --> 44:16.820
do it over SSH and that's something that you guys you know you guys really nailed and that

44:16.820 --> 44:20.520
that was hands down my favorite exhibit that year nice yeah actually we're giving away

44:20.520 --> 44:25.960
I we gave some of these away at ELC but we're giving them away here we've got these little

44:25.960 --> 44:32.400
proto boards called the tadpole and they they've just got a little RGB LED on them that you

44:32.400 --> 44:36.160
know on the Minnow board if you hook it up it just you know you can twiddle an RGB LED

44:36.160 --> 44:41.060
from GPIO and that's really cool yeah and so we're giving those away here and we're

44:41.060 --> 44:46.880
just we're trying to make the embedded world a little more approachable I mean we can run

44:46.880 --> 44:51.280
stock Linux distributions on the Minnow board yeah so I mean what's the price range on the

44:51.280 --> 44:55.560
Minnow board is that is how competitive are they there so we're a little bit more expensive

44:55.560 --> 44:59.320
we're a hundred and forty nine dollars for a dual core with two gigs of RAM dual core

44:59.320 --> 45:07.880
x86 x64 bit x86 and you're also getting Intel HD graphics gigabit Ethernet USB 3.0 yeah

45:07.880 --> 45:13.600
I mean we've got we've got a lot of the same kind of low-speed IO that similar boards in

45:13.600 --> 45:17.960
the market have yeah but what we're really bringing to the table on top of just the x86

45:17.960 --> 45:22.720
story is we've got all the high-speed IO that you would expect yeah from our kind I could

45:22.720 --> 45:26.080
actually use that in a production environment with that kind of like I mean gigabit Ethernet

45:26.080 --> 45:30.560
for me has always just sort of been the biggest pain point on a lot of these boards because

45:30.560 --> 45:34.120
we're doing such with such large data sets and things like that that the hundred megabit

45:34.120 --> 45:39.080
limitation is a killer for us oh yeah and the fact that x86 being x86 based means I

45:39.080 --> 45:42.240
can take advantage of all of the tools we're already using in-house that are built for

45:42.240 --> 45:48.380
x86 oh yeah no I mean I'm fundamentally running the exact same operating system on my laptop

45:48.380 --> 45:54.640
as I am on an embedded platform now I mean admittedly that's not the way most people

45:54.640 --> 45:59.440
think of as an embedded platform but as CPUs are getting bigger and more powerful in the

45:59.440 --> 46:04.400
embedded space these really are becoming the PCs that were around you know yeah even five

46:04.400 --> 46:10.160
years ago yeah yeah it's kind of remarkable and I think of like computers for our kids

46:10.160 --> 46:13.480
now and things like that and giving them something they can tinker with something that's a little

46:13.480 --> 46:17.840
lower cost but also still very capable so that way they have a good experience and systems

46:17.840 --> 46:21.880
like this are perfect they really fit into that and as computers are becoming more sealed

46:21.880 --> 46:26.340
up and more consumer grade it's so nice to see this this area sort of opening up again

46:26.340 --> 46:30.920
for people that might want to start learning and tinkering again oh yeah well I mean you

46:30.920 --> 46:35.520
nailed it when you said that you know PCs and everything are getting more sealed up

46:35.520 --> 46:41.200
you don't have access to even a you know simple GPIO on your laptop there's no room for it

46:41.200 --> 46:44.760
I mean the best you're getting is USB right which don't get me wrong USB is fantastic

46:44.760 --> 46:51.080
but just making an LED blink from an operating system or even from you know just a controller

46:51.080 --> 46:55.680
so cool yeah yeah it feels like the operating system sitting right on top of the hardware

46:55.680 --> 46:59.360
it's just right there now what am I you said you're giving some of these minnow boards

46:59.360 --> 47:03.680
away we're not giving the minnow boards away here we're giving the tadpole which is tadpole

47:03.680 --> 47:08.320
which is just like I said it's a just a like an RGB LED and it's very small proto space

47:08.320 --> 47:11.880
actually if you go out to minnowboard.org there's a link on the front talking about

47:11.880 --> 47:15.480
the tadpole it'll take you to our wiki and it's got the build instructions right there

47:15.480 --> 47:20.320
and you can see the finished item so what do you think about this trend I'm seeing like

47:20.320 --> 47:24.840
everybody a lot of ARM compute sticks they're like you know the entire computer on an HDMI

47:24.840 --> 47:28.520
stick I see and I think I saw something from Intel in this regard but this seems to be

47:28.520 --> 47:32.320
an area that's really really just taking off what do you think about these in comparison

47:32.320 --> 47:37.160
to sort of the more traditional boards and stuff like that so the the the compute stick

47:37.160 --> 47:42.120
kind of things I mean you're probably talking about the the I'm gonna forget its name but

47:42.120 --> 47:47.640
Intel just yeah really or it is releasing one and right there's been some press about

47:47.640 --> 47:53.520
it in the last couple of days right and the really great at least the article that I was

47:53.520 --> 47:58.700
reading last night they really hit the nail on the head with that one which was it's great

47:58.700 --> 48:03.320
for just giving you an intermediate step to just plug into your TV it's a little bit more

48:03.320 --> 48:07.120
powerful than what you'd expect out of you know like a Chromecast or something else that

48:07.120 --> 48:13.480
you would plug in but it's not quite a full PC so it's just another sealed up sort of

48:13.480 --> 48:17.680
consumer device that maybe has its purpose but it's not it's sort of limited in its full

48:17.680 --> 48:22.480
scope yep yeah well so if people want to learn more about this kind of stuff would be like

48:22.480 --> 48:25.560
some good resources they could go check out if they're watching at home or something so

48:25.560 --> 48:29.960
for the middle board go to minnowboard.org there's a link right at the top for our wiki

48:29.960 --> 48:35.400
and that's got all of our tech specs for the small board computers in general I mean they're

48:35.400 --> 48:40.600
all over the place just do a quick Google search and yeah if I could remember the name

48:40.600 --> 48:46.040
of the little Intel stick but I know I talked about it like a week or a week or so ago on

48:46.040 --> 48:49.080
the news and it's a pretty neat little device and the one that ships with Linux would look

48:49.080 --> 48:54.120
pretty good yeah I could see it likely working even as a receptionist computer hooked up

48:54.120 --> 48:57.920
to a monitor or you know somebody that just needs a basic web browser hooked up to just

48:57.920 --> 49:02.120
an LCD screen and a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse in their home yep and that's kind of

49:02.120 --> 49:06.360
exciting yeah so I but I find more of the board stuff more fascinating for my for my

49:06.360 --> 49:09.840
you know tinkering kind of nature yeah no I mean you're definitely not going to tinker

49:09.840 --> 49:13.240
with you know some of these things that are just plugging in the HDMI ports and I might

49:13.240 --> 49:17.440
watch a YouTube video on it but that's probably about it well thanks for stopping by it was

49:17.440 --> 49:20.280
great chat with you and so do you are you a free agent roaming or do you guys have a

49:20.280 --> 49:24.620
booth no we've got a booth here and I've got a talk this afternoon where I'm gonna network

49:24.620 --> 49:30.980
boot a computer over the Internet awesome really so I'm over there well I open that

49:30.980 --> 49:36.960
connection is gonna work I was gonna say I am taunting the demo gods on that one let

49:36.960 --> 49:43.080
me let me just let me assure you this is the week to try something crazy at the last possible

49:43.080 --> 49:50.480
moment and it will succeed so far yeah I was gonna say it's been lucky yeah it's been well

49:50.480 --> 49:57.280
see it's network booting a computer off of a server in California will be I've done it

49:57.280 --> 50:01.400
to England before and that one did not go well oh really it's always trickier when you

50:01.400 --> 50:07.000
had a conference too yeah conference Internet is always special that's and of course with

50:07.000 --> 50:10.760
my laptop I've like I had to bring my USB ether after gotta be wired oh yeah that seems

50:10.760 --> 50:20.080
to solve a lot of yeah no I'll be a VM on stage yeah over Wi-Fi tomorrow we've got a

50:20.080 --> 50:24.720
talk on the middle board as an open hardware platform cool I'm really glad to hear that

50:24.720 --> 50:27.920
you guys are pushing that area so it's really cool to hear you're talking about it and getting

50:27.920 --> 50:31.840
the word out because I think there's a little late to the game I don't like the games right

50:31.840 --> 50:38.120
word but at least in terms of knowledge share it seems you know and so I think it's pretty

50:38.120 --> 50:41.760
compelling especially for Linux users because it's just slam it right on there and you're

50:41.760 --> 50:46.520
good to go and you know full-fledged Linux box yep well thank you sir no thank you chatting

50:46.520 --> 50:51.400
with you good luck and have good luck with talking enjoy the rest of no thank you I wonder

50:51.400 --> 50:54.560
if anybody in the Mamba room has any experience with any of these Intel mini boards I know

50:54.560 --> 50:59.800
Noah picked one up is anybody the Mamba room experience with any of these like x86 small

50:59.800 --> 51:03.360
boards from Intel that look like they might be interesting the only place I've seen it

51:03.360 --> 51:08.480
was in conferences maybe I should get one and see what they can do might be kind of

51:08.480 --> 51:13.560
fun yeah could be kind of a fun toy to play with and it could be who knows who knows what

51:13.560 --> 51:20.560
we could discover all right well we've got an interview with the guy who who was sort

51:20.560 --> 51:26.720
of core at getting the that variant of wine that made it possible to get Netflix to play

51:26.720 --> 51:30.720
under Linux you remember before we got the HTML 5 playback under Linux there was that

51:30.720 --> 51:34.920
stopgap where you could do like this funky way to get a Silverlight environment and do

51:34.920 --> 51:39.880
all this stuff and get like the next the Netflix desktop PPA and remember all this Matt pipe

51:39.880 --> 51:44.520
lighter pipe pipe there's several there were several iterations of it and it turns out

51:44.520 --> 51:50.720
that behind the scenes it was pretty heated what was going on and it turns out also that

51:50.720 --> 51:58.160
Silverlight is a huge piece of garbage and that one of the reasons that we got HTML 5

51:58.160 --> 52:03.160
native streaming of Netflix is because the project that was getting this to work was

52:03.160 --> 52:08.280
discovering fundamental flaws in Silverlight that they believe Microsoft never wanted to

52:08.280 --> 52:14.480
see the day of light so I'll play that interview now so tell me where Netflix was a couple

52:14.480 --> 52:20.000
years ago and how you felt about it well so a couple years ago we didn't have Netflix

52:20.000 --> 52:26.120
at all on Linux except through VMs and yeah it's very true the one of the big problems

52:26.120 --> 52:32.440
with that of course is the performance issues and for me actually at the time I was doing

52:32.440 --> 52:36.560
a little bit of playing around with it but the thing that really drove me to trying to

52:36.560 --> 52:41.440
get Netflix working on Linux was that I was really pissed off at the administration at

52:41.440 --> 52:46.680
my university I was trying to get my PhD at the time and I just needed a break so that

52:46.680 --> 52:55.600
I wouldn't want to murder them and so I just kind of sat down for a week and started trying

52:55.600 --> 53:02.120
to diagnose how Silverlight worked and was just kind of poking around at the things that

53:02.120 --> 53:06.920
it did on on the system and discovering all sorts of really crazy stuff that they did

53:06.920 --> 53:16.480
that I probably shouldn't talk about because yeah it would tell you how to get the raw

53:16.480 --> 53:20.940
video data right that doesn't surprise me and wouldn't that be a heyday yeah so for

53:20.940 --> 53:25.160
obvious reasons I was not trying to get the raw video data from the Netflix feeds I was

53:25.160 --> 53:29.800
trying to get it to work properly on Linux so that I could give the community something

53:29.800 --> 53:34.560
and not have Microsoft breathing down everyone's throats and want somebody's head right exactly

53:34.560 --> 53:41.940
so the thing that was really challenging with that is that they've put a lot of stuff into

53:41.940 --> 53:47.260
it to try and detect anything that you could possibly be doing I bet to see what it's up

53:47.260 --> 53:51.040
to and so there's all sorts of things that it's doing in the background that actually

53:51.040 --> 53:55.140
have nothing to do with the video feed really like it's just trying to like figure out like

53:55.140 --> 53:59.600
like whether or not you're trying to interfere with it so there's some things example something

53:59.600 --> 54:04.200
I check for well so like one of the things that it does is that it has in the background

54:04.200 --> 54:09.280
the debug helper running and part of that is for reporting problems that happen with

54:09.280 --> 54:14.480
the software okay but part of it is that if that process dies which happens when you try

54:14.480 --> 54:21.520
to attach a debugger then the rest of it shuts down and so even if you didn't start it running

54:21.520 --> 54:26.920
a debugger if you attach one later then it knows and says oh you know it's time for me

54:26.920 --> 54:33.120
to say goodbye to you going on here I'm not even gonna risk it yeah exactly and so you

54:33.120 --> 54:36.920
know who knows how Microsoft actually debugs their own software in that case but I'm sure

54:36.920 --> 54:40.200
that they have some sort of maybe they don't that would explain a few things it would it

54:40.200 --> 54:44.320
would explain a few things especially some of the weird video acceleration stuff that

54:44.320 --> 54:49.080
yeah that Silverlight does it it uses some really old API's and and one of the things

54:49.080 --> 54:56.720
is just crazy to me is that the the key that they use for all the drivers is a 1024 bit

54:56.720 --> 55:02.760
key so like so not the driver key the driver key is better but the master key they used

55:02.760 --> 55:07.880
to sign all of the drivers is like a really ridiculously small so what would be the point

55:07.880 --> 55:12.960
of that like well they made the key in like the 2000s yeah and they never updated it

55:12.960 --> 55:18.400
and it's actually the same key that they're using for OPM now so the the cop the old system

55:18.400 --> 55:23.040
uses the same key now for OPM because it needs to be backwards compatible right and so like

55:23.040 --> 55:30.280
hmm it wouldn't really take all of that much time on a supercomputer figure out there's

55:30.280 --> 55:37.400
a whole bunch of them to be honest but like it's it's kind of ridiculous like some of

55:37.400 --> 55:44.200
the so you may be aware that we actually kind of created a project for staging wine changes

55:44.200 --> 55:48.120
as a result of some of that work that I wasn't sure if it was there as a result but I noticed

55:48.120 --> 55:53.600
it kind of happened yeah so that was before he goes on into the to the wine stuff I thought

55:53.600 --> 56:00.840
it was his comment there he's basically saying look there is this crazy soft spot right here

56:00.840 --> 56:05.160
in Silverlight that you could take advantage of if you if you knew where to poke if you

56:05.160 --> 56:11.880
rented oh I don't know some GPUs on a server somewhere and on up an Amazon you might be

56:11.880 --> 56:16.920
able to start working on this you might be able to crack it he I think I think that guy

56:16.920 --> 56:21.360
knows some major secrets and if it turns out EB in the chat room was playing Call of Duty

56:21.360 --> 56:26.440
with him that night didn't even know and that guy's wife kicked EB's butt in Call of Duty

56:26.440 --> 56:30.760
so he's a hell of a Call of Duty player apparently as well I want to get into he gets into how

56:30.760 --> 56:35.000
they've made how they sort of changed the wine project and how eventually it sort of

56:35.000 --> 56:40.720
cascaded into Netflix getting a native HTML5 playback and the changes that needed to make

56:40.720 --> 56:45.440
to the HTML5 spec before we do that though I'll mention a DigitalOcean our last sponsor

56:45.440 --> 56:49.080
of this week's show DigitalOcean is really making the show possible I tell you what not

56:49.080 --> 56:54.000
only from their support by supporting Linux Unplugged and by you for us out there by using

56:54.000 --> 57:00.080
our promo codes but the technology now just to synchronize these edits that I made all

57:00.080 --> 57:05.100
happening now under Linux all being synced through own cloud droplets that are powered

57:05.100 --> 57:10.720
up on DigitalOcean it's so slick to have the complete workflow from beginning to end for

57:10.720 --> 57:15.440
this entire Linux Fest all done under Linux these interviews that you're playing that

57:15.440 --> 57:19.740
I'm playing back right now that you're watching these are edited well I should back up so

57:19.740 --> 57:23.720
first they're recorded on a Linux rig then they're synced up to a DigitalOcean droplet

57:23.720 --> 57:28.440
for offline storage we had a hundred megabit upload at Linux Fest Northwest they rocked

57:28.440 --> 57:32.320
us with a great connection and so we were able to send footage up to our droplet in

57:32.320 --> 57:37.760
near real time store it off-site which is brilliant because we're shipping that rig

57:37.760 --> 57:41.560
back to Grand Forks North Dakota so Noah could continue to work on it so we wanted to get

57:41.560 --> 57:44.620
all the footage off it and safe immediately we took advantage of that hundred megabit

57:44.620 --> 57:48.540
connection and of course our DigitalOcean droplets rocking fast so we sent all the footage

57:48.540 --> 57:52.600
up to the DigitalOcean droplet almost as it was done we just delayed a little bit because

57:52.600 --> 57:57.080
we weren't in any rush and we didn't need to consume a ton of bandwidth it goes up there

57:57.080 --> 58:01.840
it then sinks back down to my primary workstation here at the studio that runs Arch I've got

58:01.840 --> 58:06.000
Lightworks and Avid Mux ready to go on that thing I bring all of that footage in I had

58:06.000 --> 58:10.360
to remux all of the footage into a new container which don't worry what that means but I was

58:10.360 --> 58:13.920
able to do that very quickly because it was already sitting on my file system when I sat

58:13.920 --> 58:17.640
down I saved the final encoded versions to another folder in own cloud which then sunk

58:17.640 --> 58:22.160
to my bonobo and I'm playing them back here I never once had to sneak in at any files

58:22.160 --> 58:26.440
I never lost any data it was always backed up to my DigitalOcean droplet and the entire

58:26.440 --> 58:31.560
workflow all happened using open source free software and DigitalOcean was the back-end

58:31.560 --> 58:35.720
engine that makes it all possible and when you go over to DigitalOcean and you use our

58:35.720 --> 58:41.280
promo code DOUNPLUGS you'll get a $10 credit go see what you can do for free for two months

58:41.280 --> 58:46.940
with a $5 rig I'm doing this with a $5 rig seriously it's amazing what you can do up

58:46.940 --> 58:51.100
at DigitalOcean they're a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive

58:51.100 --> 58:55.240
and easy way for you to spin up your own cloud server you can get started in less than 55

58:55.240 --> 59:00.520
seconds and the pricing is nuts it starts at only $5 a month it'll get you 512 megabytes

59:00.520 --> 59:05.600
of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer and that's a great thing because

59:05.600 --> 59:10.760
that means I'm never worrying about this all of these data all these huge files are moving

59:10.760 --> 59:13.800
around we're not going to break a terabyte with this stuff because we're recording them

59:13.800 --> 59:19.240
in a very high resolution very high bitrate x264 file they're large but they're not that

59:19.240 --> 59:23.080
large and I never have to worry about it with that terabyte of transfer it's so nice to

59:23.080 --> 59:26.880
have that peace of mind and for $5 a month it's totally nuts and if you use the promo

59:26.880 --> 59:31.800
code DOUNPLUGS then you get the $10 credit oh my gosh for two months and you get it for

59:31.800 --> 59:35.500
free I mean it's a great deal it's super powerful it could probably really fundamentally

59:35.500 --> 59:39.420
change the way you work it's changed and improved the way I work I feel like digital ocean is

59:39.420 --> 59:43.200
my data center infrastructure on demand they have data centers in New York San Francisco

59:43.200 --> 59:49.820
Singapore Amsterdam Germany and London and their interface is so impressive I love that

59:49.820 --> 59:53.760
aspect of it because it doesn't mean we waste a lot of time tinkering with stuff we get

59:53.760 --> 59:58.280
in we set it up we're done and it's very intuitive so I know anyone on the team can manage it

59:58.280 --> 01:00:03.180
no problem and the best part is they have an API that lets me take it even further if

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.800
we ever want to automate some of this stuff and I hear from people in the audience that

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:09.720
do it all the time and there's tons of great apps created by the community to take advantage

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:16.120
of that API that control panel is really the icing on top of the entire stack it all starts

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:20.640
with Linux and KVM virtualization which is a great virtualizer I think KVM is the best

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:25.160
they use SSD so that way you get super high IO that's awesome because then they have it

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:29.700
connected to tier one bandwidth at the best data centers in the world and the entire package

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:34.560
is then managed with this then they have some of the best communities on tutorials on the

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:39.720
internet between arch and digital ocean like some of the best documentation on the internet

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:45.320
is being created it's really good stuff go over to digital ocean dot com use the promo

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:49.920
code do unplugged that keeps digital that keeps Linux unplugged on the on the air because

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:54.360
it tells digital ocean hey I heard about it on Linux unplugged so you get the $10 credit

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.760
which means you don't have to have a credit card to try out digital ocean and you support

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:02.560
this show you keep us going when you use the promo code do unplugged go try them out if

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.480
from anything from developing an application to your back end infrastructure digital ocean

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:11.840
can handle it trust me I've done it digital ocean dot com you guys no matter what load

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:17.520
I put it under have never disappointed me digital ocean do unplugged alright so let's

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:21.280
go back to our interview and I want to hear a little bit more about how these changes

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:26.760
impacted the wine project kind of a result of that stuff and that some of those changes

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:31.200
weren't something that AJ wanted to bring into main wine and so what we said is okay

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:35.320
well what if we set up this thing where we can kind of make these things better so that

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:41.020
then eventually they can be included and part of that exploration we started going around

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:44.960
and trying to ask the driver manufacturers okay is there something that you can do for

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:49.520
us that then we can support some of these more advanced features in Silverlight and

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:56.800
integrate that into the driver right and the answers to that were very interesting mostly

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:01.520
in the form of like no comment things but we got somebody off of the record to tell

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:06.160
us oh well there's actually an agreement you sign when you create these drivers that Microsoft

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:12.720
signs off on that you will not make it work on other operating systems what yeah so apparently

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.520
so like the reason that you can't have the HD video through even what we've done and

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:22.600
that's all shrouded in NDAs I'm sure right yeah is that we can't make the cop work on

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:27.520
Linux because we can't access the part of the driver we would need to access to do that

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:34.680
legally and so we would have to give you a substitute of what the driver has to do which

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:42.040
involves you having a driver key which you can actually get a hold of if you try but

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:45.760
then it becomes you know kind of like the issue with DVDs and that kind of thing like

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:50.720
then you're distributing one of these numbers that's supposedly a special number yeah special

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.440
legal privileges yeah and so there's like all of this stuff around that and you know

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.000
a lot of the people that are on our farms like oh well we just want to be able to watch

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.240
our HD videos it's like no I'm sorry we have the stuff we just can't give it to you like

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:09.100
if we did then Microsoft would kill us yeah yeah that's a really interesting thing to

01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:13.120
sort of pull the rug or pull the carpet or carpet what is it the curtain pull the curtain

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:18.040
back and realize there's there's a lot going on here that you never even realize as somebody

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.880
that just sits back and watches the Netflix thing to think you always think it's these

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.960
technical hurdles or things like that and it's like no here's the exact spot and if

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:27.840
we could just get access to that but there's this legal barrier that prevents it that seems

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:33.260
like that's only gonna stick for so long until eventually somebody somewhere decides they're

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:36.160
not scared by that well so one of the things with that and actually one of the reasons

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:41.880
we haven't put a lot of effort into that recently is that the inclusion of the HTML 5 stuff

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.320
in Chrome that allows you to watch it in Chrome and the DRM stuff extensions or whatever one

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.160
of the things that we kind of heard through the grapevine is that the reason that that

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:53.640
exists is that we got things working through Silverlight and they know that there's problems

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.160
with Silverlight and so they wanted to take the pressure off they wanted to take the pressure

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.740
off that somebody might go in and it's like all things right like it solves a few other

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:07.320
problems for them as well so it's like that you can't deny the timing of it all oh yeah

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:11.860
it does seem like it lines up yeah so that was one of the things we you know we're poking

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:15.880
around some of our driver friends and being like it does this have something to do with

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:20.120
us and they're like yes this has something to do with you like whoa somebody noticed

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:23.680
they're paying attention yeah did you have that moment like oh they are watching well

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:30.760
I mean we've always tried to be very careful with the information that we give out we want

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:35.800
it to be something that like they don't shut down so yeah like you're always from the onset

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:39.280
kind of aware that they're probably gonna find out right yeah because I mean it's a

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:45.560
big deal for them and for the movie industry if that system were to break yes and so it

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:49.920
was something that we were always very cognizant of it kind of seems like they got lucky then

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:54.360
in a way because I think they got lucky that somebody was even cognizant of it because

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:59.520
other people would have just been focused more on the free the movies yeah and they

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.840
would have gotten in trouble it wouldn't have worked long term and it probably wouldn't

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:08.140
have sort of encouraged the kind of larger scale change that brought the you know more

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:12.520
native playback using HTML5 extensions I mean if that if the group had gone about if your

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:15.680
group had gone about if you've gone about the wrong way it could have blown it well

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:20.440
yeah and that that was really a big concern initially was that even though we had done

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:24.080
all the right things it's still a question of yeah like even doing all the right things

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:28.720
yeah you can still get in big trouble right and so you know one of the things you know

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.520
now that I have a PhD it's actually a little bit harder because you know it's like I'm

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:39.040
a researcher like I I can disclose all sorts of stuff and that's amazing yeah and so but

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:43.240
you know what when you do that what you want is for the community to have that that capability

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.680
and not for them to take it away because at any time they could just change the system

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:50.880
and take it away and and that's not what you want them to do right yeah because then it

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:55.520
kind of means you only bought yourself time really right yeah and then they catch up yeah

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:59.440
and so what's the point but I mean now that you know kind of Silverlight is headed out

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:03.400
the door and you know it's pretty much only used in Europe now for for that kind of stuff

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:07.840
yeah like apparently the Amazon service still uses it in Europe even though like they have

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:12.840
HTML5 here in the US and I know some sports events still use it but yeah I mean even Microsoft

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:17.560
themselves seem to be pulling back from Silverlight yeah so but like I was actually on a plane

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:21.160
the other day and they use Silverlight for the video streaming and I was like you know

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:25.000
I wonder if I can get it to run on my laptop and it's like oh sure enough yeah really yeah

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:32.160
I think it was on Southwest really and how did you get it well I mean I just downloaded

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:38.320
the oh the whole Silverlight file yeah oh so it's their web interface yeah so and so

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.320
I was able to watch you know the movies on the plane because yeah the Silverlight was

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:46.560
working properly at least as far as you know I can tell that's so funny but yeah I think

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:51.000
I think they they Microsoft made a bold bet and they tried to make they wanted to make

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.960
I think they wanted to make Silverlight an entire runtime environment oh yeah they definitely

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:59.320
did yeah it was and it's really clear in the way that it's architected that yeah it was

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:03.560
going to be their dot net for the internet right and it just you know the world did not

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:08.280
want another plug-in based thing no they were moved past it well and all the security issues

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:12.200
involved with it I think people were kind of done with it because Microsoft wasn't you

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:15.480
know they weren't in the same position they are now and it wasn't it was like oh it's

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:19.400
a it's a flash competitor it's Microsoft version they're trying to come in and they just people

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:23.520
were not receptive to it so it was a big like that that whole thing that seems like you

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:27.800
know over the history of our show watching all that Netflix stuff unravel just getting

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:31.000
to the point where yes it is now possible to get Netflix working yeah it's a huge it

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.960
was it was a huge step forward yeah you know it's like that and Steam are the like almost

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:39.800
in the entire history of Linux are like the two biggest desktop yeah right that if two

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:43.280
of that just hit and it's like wow I can't believe I'm doing this on Linux yeah it still

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:46.840
blows me away when I start Netflix or start Steam yeah and then I still have moments where

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:53.040
I'm like wow and then of course there is the there is of course April 24th which was the

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:59.840
first day that you know we live streamed from using the OBS software and a last-minute built

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:05.320
Linux rig yes that has not crashed once I might add that is very impressive it's believe

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:10.320
me when I tell you that this was a last-minute job that like the 11 people talk about the

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:16.280
11th hour no we're we are at the 11th hour in the 59th minute like I mean like it is

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:22.760
it is we woke up we woke up I came to the studio he hadn't even seen the box which to

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:27.460
some degree actually implies a certain amount of trust on your on your end because he came

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:33.720
in he went to bed the night before just assuming that that he was like well I trust you guys

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:37.080
I'm sure you'll give me a solution in the morning and to it to my credit we and and

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:41.280
Al's credit we had it done and so he walked in and like I was about ready to pack it up

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:48.200
and he's like well um could I see it work oh yeah yeah yeah we could do that I suppose

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.520
so we do that and we I showed him for like 30 seconds and then from that we packed up

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:56.280
and that that is essentially what made the decision so it was not it was not it's something

01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:00.080
we want to do for a long time yeah right yeah I mean you you're constantly doing that right

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:03.360
you're constantly looking you're saying this is what I need to do what projects are out

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:08.240
there and we've said it's closed for a long time yeah but you know not fully there exactly

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.800
yeah yeah really it's kind of a hacked together solution but and the other thing too that

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:16.040
I think sometimes gets lost is people think oh Chris isn't aware of OBS Chris is aware

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:21.400
no Chris is fully aware of OBS Chris has installed OBS and tried OBS and realized that it was

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:25.880
quite there yet and I looked at the publish date for OBS was two days ago so if we had

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:30.760
tried it one day earlier it probably wouldn't have worked wow yeah well one of the things

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:35.400
that I've seen with a lot of people is that usually for an individual there's one thing

01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:40.640
yeah there's really just one thing they tell me about it yeah and it's different for everybody

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:44.840
everybody's got their one thing a lot of people with Netflix and sometimes it sometimes it's

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:48.840
this crazy it's this crazy like side thing it's some program you haven't even heard of

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:52.280
but they cannot live without it right and then that makes it all the more difficult

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:55.600
because like for instance I had there was a girl that we are switching to Linux she

01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:00.720
was she was a college student and she used the what was the Microsoft Zune the Microsoft

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:06.400
Zune and they had a media manager for specifically for the zoo which I had never used and to

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.000
date I have never met another person that has ever used it right so I don't think it's

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.440
real popular I think that iTunes by far and above has the advantage yet she liked the

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:19.040
way the Zune thing works and then Microsoft in traditional Microsoft fashion had all of

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.720
their stupid WMAs that were all protected that wouldn't convert and play on Linux right

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:26.960
and it was just it just it just made my job that all the harder yeah that's actually one

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:30.680
of the things that I think that the wine project is really important I know a lot of community

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:36.280
members feel differently about that but man for people that just their one thing is some

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:40.720
piece of commercial software that's only available for Windows like that is the only way that

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:45.680
we're ever going to get those people to switch yeah yeah and there's it's so great for legacy

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:50.220
applications that would never ever be ported there's applications that we use in media

01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:53.520
production it's like we just need this one program we can do the whole thing under Linux

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:58.360
and and thankfully thanks to wine we're able to do it so I love it is extremely complicated

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:04.040
some of them are 3d capture of the desktop compress it to an h.264 signal transmitted

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.700
over the network to a receiver and we're doing that under wine you know here's where I come

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:11.400
down and what I come down and unlike this I am glad wine exists I like the fact that

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:15.200
wine exists I'm even more happy that certain things run better under wine than than under

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:21.240
Windows itself but I am saddened that we have to have it I am saddened that that people

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:24.560
will only write applications for Windows and thus we need a translation layer to get that

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:28.560
to Linux but I agree that you know that in in in the other thing is when you're moving

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.880
people to Linux if you try to just rip the rug out and put a new rug down you're going

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:36.360
to fail you have to baby step people into it and part of that processes and this is

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:40.440
why I kind of separate from from a lot of a lot of the free and open source guys is

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:44.980
let's get everyone on Linux first then we can worry about free open source and then

01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:49.480
we can worry about true Libra software but when we try to go from this extreme from proprietary

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:53.800
just everything works and it's being controlled from a company all the way to a niche of a

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:58.840
niche of a niche of a niche of a niche the experience is so poor and so drastic and in

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:05.120
a short amount of time I think it causes problems mm-hmm yeah so I definitely agree I mean I've

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:08.840
seen before a lot of times where people like oh well you know I want my Visual Studio tools

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:14.480
and it's like I mean we have Eclipse Eclipse does a lot of the similar stuff but if you've

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:19.600
become familiar with the Visual Studio workflow then yeah I mean you're asking for people

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:25.000
to make a multiple disruptive steps at the same time yeah yeah that's exactly right multiple

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.800
disruptive stuff I'm stealing that so I thought that was a fascinating chat with that guy

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:37.440
and I never really thought about how closely they had to walk that legal line and if they

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.880
had blown that whole wine and Netflix thing we might not have ever gotten in the native

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:47.480
playback that we have now which for better for worse I guess but yeah that was pretty

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:51.240
tight line I guess never really appreciated that well definitely seems like they walked

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:55.040
not only a tight line but they were able to do so with restraint and finesse and still

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:58.400
get the result that everybody wanted because that's really tough when you're dealing with

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:04.580
all that kind of legalese yeah yeah and I agree per the chat rooms request we can fire

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:11.640
off a single shot of it is negative in the freedom dimension we can or how about a special

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:16.480
we'll do this a value is negative how about that there you go negative there you go chat

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:21.760
room based on your request mumble room did you guys anybody you want to throw out that

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:25.520
the one app that finally had to come over before they could switch to Linux on their

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:29.920
desktop I thought that was an interesting comment they made where sometimes wine enables

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:36.280
that one application and I remember for me it was outlook back in the day oh really yeah

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:40.500
I was able to you know because evolution wasn't cutting it for me and I had to have exchange

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:46.240
integration for my job so it was outlook oh z3rq7 in the chat room says an MMO yeah that's

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:51.300
not surprising which one do you want to say z3 was it wow you know I still use wine to

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:57.080
play stow today from time to time so wine wine wine I think has helped a lot of us switch

01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:04.320
to Linux with me I wanted to yeah go ahead with me yeah my my last Windows computer was

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:10.640
finally ousted when I could run the utilities to configure the scaler and the amplifier

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:19.540
in the home cinema at home using using those tools under wine and USB to serial port adapter

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:24.000
in order to configure that stuff and that was when I finally kicked the last remaining

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.520
Windows computer into touch yeah it wow is the threes yeah yeah you know it's funny wimpy

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.640
there are things like there are little things like that like like I had a little device

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:38.360
that I required Windows to do firmware updates for a while when I finally got rid of that

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:42.000
device and I was like I don't need that anymore it's just slowly check things off the list

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.840
and it was all years ago now so we have a show on the Jupiter broadcasting network called

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:51.440
women's tech radio and one of the hosts on there should her name is Paige and she sat

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:54.760
down quite a bit on the live stream had a lot of really interesting stuff she works

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:59.640
heavily in open source development she talked a lot about doing angel development for small

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.280
projects that need angel development of angel funding although angel development she talked

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:07.300
about all of those things but her and Noah I grabbed a little bit from a conversation

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:10.400
on the stream that her Noah had that I thought was particularly interesting because I've

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:16.360
never really thought about it being a white male I never really had to but Paige mentions

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:20.360
and Noah kind of talks about it they're both coming from a minority standpoint about how

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:27.320
a minority has a bigger chance to make a huge impact in open source than they do when dealing

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:30.840
with commercial software development and they talk a little bit about that and it's it's

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:36.480
pretty powerful stuff by that stuff but the nice thing about open source is it doesn't

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:40.520
necessarily have to be a core member of the group that can do something like that if if

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:44.720
if just one person is bothered by it hey listen that's the great thing they can just open

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:48.000
it up they can go edit that stuff and they can push those changes and then they can be

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.440
accepted right yeah exactly it's one of the things that is so powerful about open source

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:56.120
is it has that community component and you know I've been doing kind of some sound bites

01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:00.800
here at the conference and it's the most common thing that people are saying like oh I'm into

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:05.200
Linux and open source even as a woman because of the community and I think that's a great

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:09.520
point that you know not to throw stones but like trying to get involved as a woman in

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:14.720
the.NET community was painful like they're just it's very much an older crowd it's a

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:18.960
lot of dudes and those and it's very much that that culture of what I know is what I'm

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:24.080
worth so they don't want to share and never mind share with a girl like it really is it's

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.480
it's unfortunate that it's still there and I'm not saying that all.NET developers like

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:32.320
this right but it's the experience you had yeah and that's perfectly valid at the same

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:35.900
time like going to a Linux users group they're like you're here you're awesome we don't care

01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:41.600
who you are that's funny you say that because statistically proprietary software actually

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:46.640
has a better track record of having acceptance of male-female split I don't remember the

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:50.160
numbers off the top of my head but it was something it's open source is notoriously

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:53.920
low for that it is actually it probably does yeah and so and that's something I think we

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:58.960
need to work on I think it's because the proprietary software is the more traditional path and

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:04.320
I disagree I mean I just I guess I disagree why that is I disagree because I think what

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:09.920
it is is that there is a groundwork laid for proprietary vendors so for example they have

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:13.680
a code of conduct they have human resources to enforce that stuff and when somebody goes

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:17.840
on on the mailing list and says what I need is a such-and-such to do such-and-such while

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.000
I'm coding and that would make me code faster and that goes out to a mailing list and offends

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.560
a bunch of women they get fired well you but they don't get fired because it's open source

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:29.720
not open source but in the enterprise so that's my I think that plays a that's I think plays

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:33.560
the biggest role per personal opinion I think that that definitely influences it but like

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:40.000
so how would you explain the idea that Ruby Ruby on Rails is there women women who code

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.680
in Ruby on Rails is about four percent like developers who identify as women who code

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:49.920
in Rails is four percent sure open source but it's also proprietary and I think that

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:55.200
part of that answer is that the numbers for women in computer science are still decent

01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:00.480
they're not great they are growing sure but so like proprietary software is the path that

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:04.800
you come out of a comp sci degree you generally go into proprietary software you don't usually

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:09.880
go into an open source career or into a web dev career like a web dev is more the non-traditional

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:14.760
path my path you know I have a degree in theater like technical theater design it's clearly

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:19.640
not a comp sci degree but my non-traditional path wound me up in web dev which is where

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:24.640
a lot of people end up because it's kind of that crafting side of body it's interesting

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:28.240
you say that because a lot of the people that I knew that originally went to school for

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:35.600
graphic design are now much more sought after for doing design for doing application development

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:39.400
they want those people they want those people with the keen eye and the people like me that

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:43.480
were that you know kind of from the old school open it up and do everything and G at it we're

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:47.160
not so desired anymore we actually had a an interview about this recently they call those

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:51.880
people unicorns you know they're designers who can also be developers yeah yeah we had

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:56.400
an interview on that in yeah I was just looking you actually it's been a little while it was

01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:01.520
episode 15 unicorns don't exist that was one yeah yeah hey while you have that site pulled

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:06.760
up maybe Paige can tell us where so if somebody was interested in women's tech radio what

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:09.760
time what day how does that work what does the schedule look like for that comes out

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:15.800
Wednesday mornings over Jupiter broadcasting.com all right yeah and it's hosted by Paige and

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:20.140
Angela and I was just looking Paige you you actually the interview you were the interviewee

01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:24.900
in episode 22 if people want to know more about Paige yeah that's actually the I'm long

01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:29.640
winded shocker that's a good that's a good problem to have if you're gonna do a podcast

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:33.960
it does seem to be so you guys actually just got kind of the back end of my story and the

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:37.520
interview is the front end of my story yeah exactly yeah and then 23 just came out this

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:41.920
week network is your net worth and then which I'm feeling this week episode 21 the importance

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:46.520
of meetups yeah yeah yeah man what a great week for that yeah I would have to say if

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:50.500
there's one thing that we have had as a consistent thing across all of our interviews it's how

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:54.080
important it is to get out there and meet people yeah I know right yeah I noticed that

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:58.760
too it's hard but you know yeah especially as a nerd if you're an introvert yeah and

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:02.360
you can really easily convince yourself that Twitter and Google Plus and Hangouts and Skype

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:06.600
solve that problem for you yeah and you can kind of just live in that for a while so I

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:12.440
promise I won't judge you for the answer to this question you run medics I do when it's

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:16.840
useful okay yeah I have a I have a question for you too Paige what technology gets you

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:22.120
the most excited right now awesome for me it's I would agree with one of our interviews

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:27.200
from today renewable energy oh yeah yeah I'm all about it about the Tesla home battery

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:32.660
you know I have not I'm a little behind we just had a big project at work so they just

01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:37.800
announced it for Earth Day yeah so I love solar specifically I think it's phenomenal

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:43.240
the idea that if we could cover what is something like 15% of the US in solar panels we could

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:48.600
more than exceed our energy needs and that's with current solar technology yeah wow so

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:52.760
I check out page on women's tech radio they come out on Wednesday mornings and they got

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:58.440
some great interviews with some open source developers at Linux fest Northwest this year

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:03.240
they they had some portable recording gear and it makes it a little easier when you don't

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:07.140
have a camera so they're able to go around and find people at the booth and interview

01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:11.800
them but it was really good talk with Paige on the live stream if for those of you got

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:16.840
to see the whole thing well Linux fest was really great this year Matt don't you think

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:20.880
it was maybe the best Festa yet it seems like it's it's always hard to equate it because

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:26.200
it's like every year is better than the last but this year definitely felt really really

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:31.400
explosive in a good way and I think a biggest piece of that is we didn't seem to have any

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:36.160
Mac equipment at the table that was like a thing I kept looking around like well there's

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:39.440
I know there's a Mac here somewhere actually not very very much Mac equipment at the whole

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:45.080
there wasn't but yeah but it was really cool and it seemed like a huge crowd yeah it seemed

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:49.040
like a it seemed like a ton of people showed up which is lots of swag which was really

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:54.160
awesome and now we look forward to the next events I know coming up the guys are going

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:59.240
to be itself we're also going to be at OSCON and I'm working on BSD can which isn't locked

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:05.400
in yet sit on my passport yet but I'm working on so those are upcoming events self and BSD

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:11.880
can and OSCON and OSCON I think is in July or something like that in Portland sounds

01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:15.880
right yeah I know it's in Portland yeah that'll be a that's a nice one because I'm just gonna

01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:20.040
take the train down there possibly or go down with the family and stay on the coast and

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:24.160
then drive into town so that'll be good stuff it's really cool to see everybody in person

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:27.920
and if you'd like to go to a future meetup meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting is where

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:32.420
we're going to schedule those including non like really big things like Michael Dominic

01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:36.200
from Kota radio is going to go to a Microsoft event in New York in a little bit and he'll

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:39.880
probably have a meetup there and schedule it at the meetup page that's a lot of fun

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:44.040
and we brought a few people back to the studio after Linux fest and we had a barbecue here

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:51.920
Albert and his brother brought in some burgers and we had dogs and we had chicken skewers

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:59.600
and and we all celebrated by everybody queued up YouTube videos on the Chromecast the blaster

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:06.040
box was fun yeah and so we just watched those all night and I think they kept going till

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.680
oh I don't know I don't remember what time you left Matt but they kept going for quite

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:13.360
a while after that oh did they really yeah I think I left I left not too long after so

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:16.560
I could I could see them going well into the night yeah well you know because everybody

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:21.320
was just like couch locked and nobody wanted to get up even when it was time to get food

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:25.560
people didn't really want to get up everybody was exhausted it was very little sleep but

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:30.520
boy I tell you what it really makes me think I think we have the best crew in the world

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:35.400
like it was unbelievable the stuff we pulled off he had you know unbelievable obstacles

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:39.760
you guys you've heard about some of the stuff but you have no idea you just have no idea

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:44.440
it's so amazing so it was really cool to have everybody here and get to get to do that in

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:48.920
person I mean it's I'm always impressed with what we're able to accomplish with all of

01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:54.400
us all over the place all remotely yeah right but geez Louise it was unbelievable what we

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:59.200
accomplished in the time that we all had together unbelievable well I think the secrets the

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:03.240
behind the scenes guys the folks that you you know you see them in the video clips walking

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:06.800
in the back you don't really hear from them and I can I can think of three off the top

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:13.360
of my head that just I mean it you know everybody yeah it was awesome yeah and so it was great

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:16.800
we got we had almost everybody out to dinner for the whole crew which was really cool and

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:20.720
all that stuff right all right Matt well we'll wrap it up right there that'll kind of bring

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:25.000
us to the end of this week's unplugged but I'd love to hear you guys's feedback especially

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.160
on that ZFS stuff so don't forget you can go over to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash

okay I have one more clip that I want to play from Linux Fest Northwest but I feel like

01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:58.820
if I put it in the post show then I'm abstained from any legal ramifications and and I don't

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:04.060
believe I actually now Matt you you may get implicated in this video but I don't believe

01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:10.060
I'm implicated in this video but but Matt and I had no knowledge of this we had this

01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:13.740
this we can both say this was not premeditated but I'm not like pole dancing or nothing

01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:20.740
right you know what happened the last few years at Linux Fest Northwest our booth has

01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:27.500
come under attack now broadcasting does not start a war Jupiter broadcasting would never

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:35.060
start a war but Jupiter broadcasting will finish a war and every year every year nerf

01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:40.220
guns are brought to our booth while we are live on the air and we are assaulted we are

01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:46.460
assaulted and this year this year we struck back this year this year we brought guns to

01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:52.580
a knife fight and I play you the clip as it was captured on the live stream and I gotta

01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:58.220
hand it to you Matt you are two for two last year you had the money shot and this year

01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:04.860
you have the money shot again man you're two for two you gotta watch this now this is something

01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:10.220
that happened for those of you who have not watched our coverage before so you know we

01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:14.060
got a little we got we got a little problem here we have to have a serious conversation

01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:18.900
your Jupiter broadcasting booth is about to become under attack tell me how it's gonna

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:22.460
become under attack there is an aggressive sect of Linux users present at Linux Fest

01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:28.720
Northwest they are armed with nerf weapons and they attack us and you better arm yourself

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:32.980
Noah and get your camera ready because all they have to say now under the table there

01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:38.540
I may or may not be handing Noah arms Matt may have may or may not have passed I was

01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:42.620
putting them down both ways I was like we're dancing let's get her on as I'm talking on

01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:47.380
camera I'm opening them but I have to be sly because they're monitoring our feeds before

01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:57.380
they attack it is it may be dawn Noah we are being armed as we speak this is this is troubling

01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:03.980
and for insurance purposes I would ask that you all make your own local recording so now

01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:11.460
you can Jed walks by okay no you go go Noah go what am I doing oh you're oh oh all right

01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:15.820
all right all right okay all right okay so you're giving us a gun now what I didn't know

01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:21.100
at this time but if you watch the video playback closely Jed is implanting his children strategically

01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:28.940
in the crowd yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no Alan Jude

01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:34.420
member of the Jupiter broadcasting crew host of tech snap and BSD now wearing a Jupiter

01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:41.580
broadcasting shirt note Alan you're not even in the camera shot first shot fired by Alan

01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:55.220
Jude now Jed that was mine okay now we sit there we take it for a minute right now the

01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:59.940
silly string goes crazy mr. system blaster nailed and then there goes Matt Matt breaks

01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:18.260
out the silly string nails kid nails kids kid again and then Matt nails my silly string

01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:22.780
actually had a broken nozzle so when I initially sprayed it it sprayed everywhere so I had

01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:26.260
to like reposition it before I could get to my shot and I wanted to make sure it counted

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:29.780
and then Matt and then Matt's going in for the kill and this is me I'm calling Matt out

01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:53.180
we have spilled enough blood right now this is going for it oh my gosh liability liability

01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:57.180
I did not I did not ask well if you look at where all the silly string has come and gone

01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:02.940
none of it points back to us kick the silly string out get it out of here get rid of the

01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:07.860
evidence get rid of the evidence can you believe Alan turned on us I cannot believe that now

01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:10.900
one thing I want to also point out that's really really important is the man that was

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:15.660
on the ground really early on Albert was out there with a broom yeah he was wasn't he was

01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:20.980
out there sweeping that stuff up yeah you know I mean I think I think because Albert

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:24.660
did that prevented us from getting any trouble because we got right up on the cleanup crew

01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:30.260
and that was good yeah the red shirt walked by you know I gave him kind of a original

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:51.380
serious death look and you know he kept walking and we you know it was all good
