00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
You guys follow Lifehacker right? Hey Noah's in studio by the way. Hello. Hey you follow Lifehacker right?

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,180
Did you know that they do these Linux packs? Have you seen these these here Linux packs?

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,040
No. Yeah, they do these Linux packs of every year and Winston Gordon did one this year

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,440
And I wanted to go through a couple of the apps with you guys

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,000
And I think some of them have been app picks on the last but not all of them

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,360
So I thought maybe we'd go through a couple of them and see what we thought and then it's you know

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,400
It's like pre-show stuff

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,920
I don't think it's main show stuff, but we'll take a look at it and see what we get

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,920
So here's a couple of the apps they picked okay?

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,880
For productivity Matt you might like this one. They thought the best launcher was synapse

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,940
Not knowing nice. Yeah, they say app launchers bring a lot to your workflow now

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,680
They both note that unfortunately app launchers are in a weird spot in the Linux world

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,560
Noam do hasn't had any major update since 2009 and synapse

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,880
Also doesn't appear to be all but abandoned now, so I guess it's probably because a lot of desktops just build that in these days

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,200
I think it's gonna take it all broken for anything to actually happen with it

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,000
I think that's what will have to happen. Yeah. Yeah, okay. You ready for the text editor

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,720
All right, Kate from KDE and genie which genie has been a pick before on the Linux action show

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,400
I guess I don't know I supply him text to made a mate. They gave it a mention, but I

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,920
Like Kate kind of you know it's great. If you're a KDE person. I don't know

20
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,080
That's fine. It's kind of like saying yeah, it's great. If you're a good own person or a no person

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,200
Yeah, I mean whatever. I want something a little sexier more exciting G. Okay. That's cool. Yeah, he's all right

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,120
No is that I got it. I am oh, yeah, you know why did you do you know that or you know?

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:47,080
I'm guessing I knew well you use Fedora, so it right well Red Hat is what it comes from oh, yeah

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,480
Well here's the thing at Red Hat if you take any Red Hat course you'll be so sick of

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,640
Knowing you have to do everything in vim basically

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,760
It's all the courseware and everything for it you don't but the instructor will come up and go well

27
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,840
I don't know how to oh yeah, you do

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,600
Oh, you don't because when I was looking at it you did oh it was all oh in fact

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,400
You know what when I was doing the Red Hat course the guy next to me couldn't remember how to get

30
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,240
Repo configured and he broke into the oh no copy the RPMs off installed

31
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Instructor comes over calls Red Hat and they go did he use the internet no did he bring an outside material no he passes

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,640
No, they don't care. They don't care how you get the objectives. No. I know that part

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,440
Yeah, I know, but like like the culture of it's all it's gotta be inside. That's right. Yeah, yes

34
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,660
Okay, they said best office editor Libre office all right. We can give them that best web browser, okay?

35
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,600
Let's see here. The problem is it's negative in the freedom

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,420
Dimension gave it to Chrome. They gave it to Chrome. It's not that's totally really. Yeah, it's not necessarily

37
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,100
That's actually my next article topic. That's really funny really okay, and then email interesting, okay?

38
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,760
I got a I got a I got a Thunderbird problem. There's definitely an advantage to Chrome in that it's getting

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:00,240
Capsicum support even on Linux yeah, Chrome is you know I mean I keep trying to switch back to Firefox and Chrome keeps pulling me

40
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,680
Back for a few reasons. I'd like my fire box. Yeah, especially under Linux

41
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,520
Are you saying Thunderbird because that's what I could probably argue with you about they say Thunderbird development is slowed down

42
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,280
But there's still their favorite desktop email client well

43
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,600
Yes, there's no more development to do because it works perfectly fine stop breaking it

44
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,320
The last couple times they've tried to do stuff to Thunderbird all they've done is made it worse

45
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,680
So if they're just gonna stop and just do maintenance on it. I am a very happy badger. Yeah, I agree. I agree

46
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,460
I think the pimification of it

47
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,320
You know the personal information manager

48
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,080
Effication of the Thunderbird was probably where they really went south so I think by sticking to just being an email client doing that well

49
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,600
Oh, yeah, that's cool for me. It was mostly when they moved buttons

50
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,440
Yeah, they did do a big redesign semi-recently

51
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,240
And I like it now having tabs is very useful being able to keep all my sense stuff open in a second tab

52
00:03:53,240 --> 00:04:00,080
It's actually very useful. It's just every time they moved the buttons it messes up my entire flow man workflow. You got a flow

53
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,000
I appreciate that because that's exactly how I am about I'm having I was gonna

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,720
I was gonna bring this up in the post show

55
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,040
But I'm having in fact I will remind me to I have a Thunderbolt like it's like a UI

56
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Wiggly issue that I thought I had solved a long time ago, and now I can't fix it, but

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,920
Let's move on in the list, and then we'll wrap up because it's not too too amazing

58
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,320
Now pigeon came in for the best instant messaging client they gave mention to empathy

59
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,640
VLC for best video they gave mention to a few others Plex beat XBMC

60
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,640
Which I thought was interesting those two they're kind of different though, right? Yeah, like ones for one thing and ones for another

61
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:41,520
I Spotify for music wow

62
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,720
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that just hit 50 and never looked better

63
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,280
My name is Chris

64
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:59,000
Hey, Matt. Hello welcome to episode 50 buddy. All right already. I know can you believe it?

65
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,400
Can you but it's crazy, and you know what it's a special episode too because we're packing up

66
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,640
We're getting ready to go down to OS con and so Noah mr. Colonel Linux himself has joined us

67
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,240
I have in studio Noah welcome to life some plug. Thanks for having me good to have you here in meat space

68
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,880
It's nice. I like the Google you were still rocking the Google glass have you been recording this whole thing I?

69
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,380
Actually, I did record the intro just a little bit. Okay good good. How's the fedora install going absolutely well actually

70
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,660
I'm just in a terminal in the IRC so I haven't really played with it, okay

71
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,800
Yeah, I loaded him up a box with fedora 21

72
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,720
So he'd feel right at home because he's a fedora guy he shows up with an arch box man and set it right on your desk

73
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,700
Wow, yeah, you know respect a curveball curveball. Well. We got some good stuff to get into today

74
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:46,020
We're also joined of course by our virtual lug over there the mumble room glad to have them along. Hey. Oh everybody

75
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,400
Hey, I wanted to start with some feedback like we often do there was some pics

76
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,240
We had on Linux action show for bandwidth monitoring

77
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,120
I think it was MBW Mon on Sunday, and we ended up getting a note in from a plasma widget author named Rob

78
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,480
And he wrote and he said hey Chris and Matt on the last show you were discussing

79
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,000
Your appreciation for a simple bandwidth monitor at the risk of tooting my own horn

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,220
I wanted to add a quick plug for my own project socket sentry

81
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,060
Which is my favorite bandwidth monitor on the KD desktop, so it's awesome to hear from him

82
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,400
He says it's a bandwidth monitor in KD plasma widget that you can leave on your desktop or dock as a panel icon

83
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,280
What sets it apart from similar tools though is that it breaks down bandwidth per process or program?

84
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,720
So you can quickly see whether your network slowdown is caused by Firefox or SFTP for example

85
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,480
It uses lib pcap under the hood so you can filter the traffic at monitors using the same expression language and tools like TCP

86
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:44,360
Dump a wireshark and also goes easy on the CPU in fact when it's hidden in your panel as an icon it stops monitoring until

87
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,940
You pop it up, so there's no overhead when you don't need it

88
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:52,980
It's in the AUR as KD plasma dash applets dash sock century or socket century

89
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,920
I haven't updated in a few years

90
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,160
But that's mainly because it does everything it needs to do and it works under modern versions of KD

91
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,220
So I'd love to know what you think and thanks. Give up the great work

92
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,480
Well, I've already tried it out before every time I set up KD. I set this thing up

93
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,120
Are you like this I know with your do you have like?

94
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,680
Conky and bandwidth monitors on your desktop, so here's the thing I test out a lot of different laptops

95
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,980
To see how they're gonna work and how they're gonna work in specific circumstances

96
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,280
So I switch like I have a different machine now than then when you saw me a couple months ago

97
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,640
Yeah, because of that I try and keep it

98
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,040
I change things as I go along it starts out sucking that when something bugs me

99
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,600
Then I'll add it in that is that is exactly how I do it especially like right now

100
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,200
We've been moving hardware around. I'm not even like using the same computer week to week anymore right so

101
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,440
Having the ability to just keep it as close to stock means that I can get up and working a little bit faster

102
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,060
And then the longer I use a machine the more I bring it under my control mm-hmm

103
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,780
What about you Matt are you a tweaker with your like do you have a CPU monitor on your desktop and all that stuff?

104
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,900
I do I generally prefer to kind of go with a gooey option

105
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,820
I usually I'll have it something that can kind of peek at although recently I found myself

106
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,900
Kind of removing myself from using that more

107
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,580
And I'm almost just kind of trusting what I don't know because I find that my OCD tends to yeah

108
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:06,340
Yeah, I can it can be distracting can it too like it can like you can be like what's going on up there

109
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:12,140
And it really let's be honest computers are powerful enough and Linux is good enough and managing processes that it's not really necessary

110
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,140
You know what I mean, so especially

111
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,780
Killing it anyway, so whatever yeah

112
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,900
Go ahead Alan

113
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,420
Yeah

114
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:26,620
Well you have eight processors the percent CPU load actually can matter less and then a widget can't be big enough to

115
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,940
Display all eight threads on your CPU right it might be showing one core in the widget

116
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:37,580
And you have seven other cores that are idle yeah, you know if you have eight cores then each one's like 13% or whatever and so

117
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,020
when your CPU usage you can't actually tell that some program is actually pegged on one CPU and

118
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:49,940
Would be going faster if it was multi threaded or whatever so I don't know I don't ever see the my desktop

119
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,900
I always have whatever I'm working on like I might have multiple windows

120
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:59,860
But I never see what's in the background like my desktop wallpaper or any and we just have it up and put there

121
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,060
Yeah, yeah, if you're saying your desktop. You're not working on

122
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,500
Sounds like he's saying hey guys. You know while you're looking at your desktops and making them pretty I'm getting work done

123
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:16,740
What if you're like me and you just have a monitor just for all your crap like I have a crap monitor sometimes in some

124
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,140
Of my setups. I'm a bad person

125
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:24,260
Yeah, in fact that brings us to our next email from steve-o now unfortunately q5 sis who rocks a six monitor Linux setup

126
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,260
Didn't join us today because he's working late

127
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,100
But maybe he'll be able to chime in those chime in on this feedback style, but steve-o writes, and he says hey guys

128
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,500
I've been researching

129
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,620
Possible multi monitor setups for gaming under Linux and there seems to be a lot of conflicting information

130
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:44,140
I found a reddit post talking about how difficult it is to set up particularly with two video cards on the other hand

131
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,900
I found posted for Onyx any links to a for Onyx quad monitor review which seems to indicate. It's fairly easy

132
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,700
I'm a Linux admin by trade, and I've been using Linux on my desktop since 2006 however

133
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,780
This will be my first time really considering more than two monitors for my home setup

134
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,740
Ideally I'd like to get a six monitor setup going cheers. I know right

135
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,300
Anybody tried a multi monitor setup with gaming is it get weird

136
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,100
You ever tried it Noah. Nope. I have multi monitors, but I don't use it for gaming. Yeah

137
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:18,380
well, I bet I go ahead I've tried it for I've tried it for like flight simulation and

138
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:24,180
It works kind of but that was also like back in

139
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,300
2004 when it didn't really work as well as it does now

140
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:32,780
I'm not sure about now Riley now a lot of times it comes down to whether the game supports it or not sure yeah

141
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:37,460
If the game isn't meant to be split then you end up with like an after screen on one monitor and half on the other

142
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,780
Monitor in this and under the Linux to that

143
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:45,580
There's a bit of an extra like what toolkit or whatever did they write it towards like are they using SDL or whatnot Riley thinks?

144
00:10:45,580 --> 00:11:00,980
Riley you think this is a case for awesome? I think I remember q5 saying he uses open box

145
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,420
You remember what he says he uses for his setup. What's the default in in puppy? I don't know well except

146
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:12,380
He doesn't use his open box. He's crazy. Does he he's crazy using puppy, but anyways

147
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,100
We'd love to get your inputs because I mean I you know what I just got X plane on Steam

148
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:23,700
It was it was not cheap either, but yeah, well that's on my wish list X plane is have you played it? Yeah, it's amazing

149
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:30,660
Yeah, you know they have actually hardware devices you can bring in and have like the full experience. Yeah, yeah

150
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:37,020
I mean they're crazy expensive. Yeah. Yeah, I looked at the only computer-based flight simulator that is certified by the FAA

151
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,020
Right or actually doing stuff from getting time. Yeah, you can log hours. What's amazing?

152
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,340
Yeah is ours you can take off right here at our local Arlington Airport and or SeaTac

153
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,740
So I was just blown away by it

154
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,740
So I I I could see where steve-o is coming from here because I'm looking at the I'm looking at X plane

155
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,300
And I'm thinking I had a few monitors this would be kind of amazing

156
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,740
And I'd love to hear how it works out for you Steve and if anybody out there has any advice or feedback

157
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,540
You can drop us a line in the Linux unplugged

158
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,780
feedback thread over at linuxactionshow.reddit.com or go to Jupiter broadcasting.com slash contact and

159
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:18,060
Shoot us an email with your thoughts on what Steve could do to win with six monitors and video games

160
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,320
Yeah, that sounds like that could be a bumpy ride right I'm thinking zone minder

161
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,340
That's the first thing that comes to my mind is is to have a compound and to have zone minders and gun turrets you got

162
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,180
to have gun turrets I

163
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,520
Want high-caliber gun turrets. I'm talking about like full. You know set them up on raspberry pies. They motion sensing

164
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,620
I'm talking the whole package. I like this now. This is this is like the zombie apocalypse bunker

165
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,740
That's powered by Linux

166
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,780
And I think there's a I think there's a role to play in there for some raspberry pie devices, too

167
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:51,180
And you know Matt before that zombie apocalypse hits you might want to get yourself a digital ocean droplet

168
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,060
So that way you can back up your data and protect it from those zombies go over to digital ocean comm and use the promo

169
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,920
Code get ready for this because July is almost over. It's your last chance to use it unplug July

170
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:07,600
How about that unplugged July when you check out over digital ocean comm that's gonna give you ten dollars towards a digital ocean droplet

171
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,900
Run that sucker for two months why because for five dollars you can create a cloud server in 55 seconds and pricing plans are

172
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,680
Straightforward you start the five dollar mark, and then you'll work your way up at each incarnation

173
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,280
You get something really great more storage more bandwidth more CPU really straightforward

174
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,600
But here's what you get for five dollars you get 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte

175
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,600
SSD one blazing fast CPU and a terabyte of transfer all at a fixed cost for five dollars

176
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,440
So you know exactly how much you're gonna pay and I want to underscore that I don't want you to go out there and get

177
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,960
A cloud system where you get oh, here's my CPU bill. Here's my transfer bill. Oh, it's a $200 bill

178
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,880
That's actually happened to me, and it's a painful process. I had to explain it to my boss, and it was very awkward

179
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,440
I is like hey boss. Sorry. Yeah, I put that on the card. I hope you don't mind look

180
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,880
That's what I love about digital ocean

181
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,000
It's a fixed cost which also means that as a contractor if I was gonna resell it it makes it super easy if I'm building

182
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,800
An open source project or I'm using it as a back end for an app

183
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,520
I know exactly what my run cost is gonna be and digital ocean is so simple

184
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,600
They're dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy to spin up cloud service you get root access

185
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,620
We've had users out there. They've done it under 31 seconds. It's unbelievable how fast you can do it

186
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,000
And they've got a brand new London data center

187
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,960
They just spun up the new London data center pretty cool and some of the audience members have been jumping on that

188
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,980
They also have data center locations in New York San Francisco Singapore and Amsterdam

189
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:29,780
their interface is simple and their control panel is incredibly intuitive and power users can replicate that control panel on a much larger scale with

190
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,780
their straightforward API which is

191
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,060
Gorgeous now. I'm not one to just talk chauvinistically about API's

192
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,460
But as far as good-looking API's go this digital ocean one is good-looking

193
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,140
I've heard good things

194
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,560
And that's why you're seeing really great apps in the community prop up

195
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:48,700
Apps that integrate with the Ubuntu desktop the Mac desktop Windows desktop you can manage your droplet right from your desktop check on its status

196
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,540
Get its IP and then when you need to go to the digital ocean website their interface is incredible

197
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,540
their interface sets the bar it

198
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,380
utilizes the power of Linux KVM connected to tier 1 bandwidth and data centers all over the world and

199
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,540
Gives you access to do all of that in a matter of seconds

200
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:08,380
Go create yourself a droplet right now and use the code unplugged July when you check out to get a $10 credit

201
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:14,380
You can use that $5 rig for two months for absolutely free and a big thanks to digital ocean for sponsoring Linux unplugged

202
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,020
Yeah, man. I tell you what we just spun up a new one here for a little secret project

203
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,180
We're working on in the skunk works laboratory over Jupiter broadcasting comm

204
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:28,380
All right, I got what we're kind of a follow-up email from jay-z a longtime viewer of the Linux action show

205
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,860
He writes in on encapsulated Linux applications. We've been talking about

206
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,260
Container izing applications on the Linux desktop quad X next week. That's the gnome developer conference

207
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,540
That's gonna be a huge topic there. Yeah, maybe the main topic

208
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,260
I don't know I'm just guessing but it's gonna be big so jay-z a writes in it says hey

209
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,220
I wondered why you haven't talked much about Linux portable apps. It's a really great

210
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,580
It's really great for users that don't deal with dependencies on different distros and such

211
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,100
Even the portable Linux games is awesome since games are non-standard on Linux installs

212
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,700
And he links us to portable Linux games org. He says let us let me know what you think and check it out

213
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:08,020
Have you seen this man? No, no, I haven't you're probably familiar with the whole portable apps concept on

214
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,900
Winders, have you seen the portable? Yeah, it's really kind of cool. I'll tell you a little bit

215
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:20,780
It's it's based around this technology called app image kit and app image kit is a format

216
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,300
That is it lets you have that if you're watching the video version here

217
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,420
I've I've brought up a little bit of a diagram and you can see it's essentially a self-contained image file

218
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,620
You've got an executable in there that could be 32-bit or 64-bit and then you've got a directory structure

219
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,860
That sort of replicates slash user slash bin slash lib and slash share

220
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,780
So everything lives in this single image kit file and then you can move this around and it can link to

221
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,420
Libraries outside the image kit file or you can have everything statically linked self-contained in there. I basically got it, right?

222
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,300
Yeah, that's it

223
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:58,300
And so the portable Linux games site has taken this technology and applied it to video games and essentially

224
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,920
Some of these are just a simple download and run

225
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,760
Some of them are a quick download you run the shell script or the pearl script and then you have a completely containerized

226
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,840
Application that you can put on pretty much any Linux box and just distribute as an HTTP download. It's pretty cool

227
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,000
Interesting. Yeah, and I think it's something I want to play a little bit with I've heard of it never used it

228
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,480
I don't know how I don't know if it works out of the box on arch or what, right?

229
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,160
To say but I think that's how the PDI system that the new version is is going to work is kind of the same idea

230
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,400
Is it the app is in this like virtual file system and self-contained so you just move it around

231
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,400
And I don't want to be the guy to say but I think this is how the Mac does it, too

232
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,920
Oh, really? I think it is. Yes. I think that's been done at least a couple of times before

233
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,680
So how does this compare to say the old click click project?

234
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,960
I mean, it seems like there's a little bit of a correlation there

235
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,200
Yeah, I'm not sure like how they distributed it on like how they did the libraries and things like that

236
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,820
I don't know if there's a correlation there or if it's more just similar and functionality and concept

237
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,560
Okay, it's not here to talk about it. Oh that poppy go figure, right?

238
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,660
He's probably doing something Ubuntu ish. You can find a chicken. Yeah

239
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,680
Yes

240
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,680
Poppy chasing the chicken is the thing

241
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:18,540
The app image kit is up on github and they're working on it and the Linux portable game guys are working with them, too

242
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,600
Oh, hi there. Hey chrome. How you doing? And

243
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,640
They got a lot of good games from quake

244
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,040
She's look at all this stuff. You just have a crap ton you guys star conflicts up there, too

245
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,480
Wow Z NES the emulator is up there

246
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,360
Zero AD is on the site. Look at all this stuff abuse pioneer flare. I got to check this out

247
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,640
I think I'm gonna try this maybe on my train ride. Yeah, what all right

248
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,520
As long as that Wi-Fi connections working just do a little download

249
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,120
I'd be really curious to see if it just works and I guess it's supposed to support 64-bit or 32-bit

250
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,320
So jza sent that in it. So just for some of the details the app image

251
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,000
This is something that's already out there. That's why I find this fascinating since this is becoming such a big topic

252
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah, I'm app image is an ISO

253
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,080
966 oh file the contents of the file can be compressed with the ZF so you can even make it smaller and the standard supports that

254
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,680
The after contains one desktop file per the free desktop or dot org spec

255
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,920
So any desktop that implements that dot desktop file, which is all of them

256
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,200
Will be able to read the file and just add a menu entry to your desktop to KDE or GNOME

257
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,520
So it even works in with your integrated

258
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,760
Desktop menu system. Now. Do you think this could larger scale become a

259
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,840
Larger scale become a unit a way to bring a unified installer to Linux. Yeah, I do

260
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,360
I mean, I think it is actually I think it's offering that today. I think that's exactly what it's offering today

261
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,920
It's just not widespread. Do you think it'll become I guess culturally accepted? No, I

262
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,460
Think this is one of those things where something this scale

263
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:52,920
It almost has to come from somebody with the appropriate weight to move it. Oh, you know what I mean?

264
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,680
I'm kind of saying I'm kind of saying Red Hat. Yeah, that's kind of working on it. Cool. Well, you don't think so

265
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:03,620
No, I think no. No, I I I yeah, I mean come on Sousa

266
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,120
No, I'm serious like I mean I you guys know, I mean just over the record

267
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:15,280
We know people we like people who work for Sousa. I used to deploy Sousa Enterprise Linux as part of my job

268
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,460
I thought it was the best Enterprise Linux

269
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,460
I was a hat. So how how I mean, how is Sousa stain relevant these days?

270
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,220
I love what they're working on too, which is the shame of it

271
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,320
I love the evergreen cons or the whatever the evergreen concept they have

272
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,500
I love the build service all of that the studio

273
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:37,740
But so what do you go to when you want a when you want a desktop environment that that's commercially supported CentOS

274
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,560
Well, yeah, but that's not I mean that's you can buy support for yeah, but it's meant more towards servers though, right?

275
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:47,980
I mean, you're not gonna sit there. You're not gonna have somebody do realistically Chrome OS. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's yeah

276
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:53,540
Yeah, I mean that's what's unfortunate right is now that CentOS is a legitimate Red Hat project

277
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:00,900
That's and then you have Ubuntu who's rocking it on the cloud space to that markets really getting tied up, right?

278
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:06,540
I think in the back end. Yes, but I don't I don't see too many people sitting down at their workstations and using CentOS to

279
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,620
Yeah, I don't think there's I don't think people are really competing right there right now

280
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:17,020
I mean, I think the only person really competing there is Google sure. I mean I'm canonical sure

281
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,540
I mean you're seeing a lot of LTS deployments there, but I think that's despite their efforts. Mm-hmm. I

282
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,380
Don't know. I don't mean to dog on openSUSE, but I've been it's just actually something

283
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,980
I've been thinking a lot about off airs

284
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:33,420
Where do they really fit in in the political structure now for Linux and when you think about moving something like this app image

285
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,420
kit format forward

286
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:40,360
I I mean, okay. Let's this isn't as big but it's almost as big as like system D

287
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,760
Almost could you picture system D succeeding if it was an openSUSE effort or a SUSE effort? No

288
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,740
Could you see it succeeding if it was anybody but right now?

289
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,760
But I say that primarily based on the fact that upstart was so heavily backed by canonical and canonical had so much

290
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,100
Driving force behind it behind upstart already

291
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:03,680
So you have to come to the table with something that offers a lot more and be backed by someone that's as big or bigger

292
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,460
Right. Yeah, Riley makes a good point. Go ahead Riley

293
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,540
Yeah, I will no I think it's a really well engineered high quality distribution

294
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:24,140
I think it may be sometimes people find the package management with zipper and stuff is a little foreign still

295
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,340
It's maybe not quite as tight as they want and you tied in

296
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:34,420
As far as a nice Nome or a nice KDE implementation goes openSUSE or 13.1 is great. Mm-hmm

297
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,420
Mm-hmm. Yeah another really good. I

298
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:42,100
Thought the point of SUSE was basically to be the alternative to Red Hat for enterprises

299
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,640
But I don't know if anybody really wants an alternative. Well, I think it's I think it's Ubuntu LTS. Unfortunately

300
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,500
Yeah, I mean you really is you've got existing market moment

301
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,740
I guess you've been to good works on servers, doesn't it? I think I think they've I think they've pretty

302
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,460
Handsomely surpassed the SUSE's installation base Google. Yeah, they have a specific

303
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,940
Download for installing on servers, right?

304
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:09,500
I've seen that and on easy to when I guess when Google went to dump a lot of the Red Hat servers

305
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,060
They went to Ubuntu. So yeah, tell you yeah

306
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:20,020
Yeah, well on to actually and it wasn't it just was it just Spotify who just publicly announced they're switching from Debian to Ubuntu

307
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,060
Yeah, that's right. That's right

308
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:27,580
And and the reason is is because they just get a slightly better mixture of packages and they like the LTS schedule that they can

309
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,460
Set their IT clock to

310
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,060
And I well, I want to make sure I'm being clear

311
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:36,540
I don't I'm not dogging on the quality of SUSE the people who work on SUSE or what SUSE it does

312
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,920
I think he asked is great. I think it's still one of the most well thought out distributions from top to bottom

313
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,260
It has saved my ass several times. They have like recovery modes

314
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,740
You can go into that literally got us back up and working. I'm not saying any of that

315
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,100
I'm saying the market seems to be deciding these things

316
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,340
Mm-hmm

317
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,620
Despite their best intentions and efforts and so when I look at this app image kit

318
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,620
It feels like you know

319
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:03,260
Red Hat and fedora and Ubuntu would all and Debian really together would all have to get behind it to really make it work

320
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,340
But it has to start with somebody that has the ability to push it

321
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,860
It can't just you know what I mean?

322
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,860
Like eventually there has to be an entire

323
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:15,460
Consensus consensus like we saw with system D eventually and it was awful and embarrassing but we got there

324
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,580
We're still kind of not there, but we got there

325
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:24,300
The same thing would have to happen with this right and it has to be started off by somebody who can just you know champion

326
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:31,500
I mean would system D have been successful if it wasn't for Lenart out there taking on every criticism or responding with massively detailed technical

327
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,900
Explanations explaining why things are the way they are

328
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:41,220
I don't look Lenart was the person who you could probably attribute a lot of publicly pushing system D through

329
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,260
Who's gonna do this for the standard right?

330
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,260
But if you have the gnome group working on desktop container ization you get some of those same people now

331
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,140
They're gonna be pushing that standard right and that might have the momentum

332
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,100
All you need is just a couple distributions to latch on so that it becomes

333
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,620
You're the you're the you're the you're the ugly red stepchild

334
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,060
Yeah, if if you don't follow that standard right once you can establish that right then everything else

335
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,900
What's your odd man out?

336
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,540
It's actually harder to work on your system because you don't do something right even if Ubuntu and Red Hat

337
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,140
You know you get like two or three of them that had a standardized package installer

338
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:17,020
I think everything else would follow yeah, maybe not everything I mean you're always gonna have yeah like you arch people or slack

339
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:22,980
Yeah, something like that. Yeah, I'm sorry fedora guy couldn't hear you over the sound of your fedora still installing all right

340
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,980
Well, I wanted to move us to us

341
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:30,220
Something kind of cool that we have coming up get your nostalgia hats on everybody

342
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,540
You know we're gonna go back in time here in a few minutes

343
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,060
Q5 system been working on a way back machine for the Linux unplugged show

344
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,180
Something kind of we've all been running some of us been running links for a long time some of us are new

345
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,460
But I think it's always good to go back and see where we come from before we do that

346
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:50,860
I want to thank this week's sponsor ting go over to Linux dot ting.com why because it's got Linux in the URL

347
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,940
Seriously Linux dot ting.com that also lets them know you appreciate them sponsored Linux unplugged show

348
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:01,340
But unless you check out ting what is ting ting is mobile that makes sense my mobile service fighter and Matt's mobile service fighter in

349
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:07,360
fact right well over a year now and ting rocks because it's only a flat six dollars per month and just your usage on top

350
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,340
Of that no contract no early termination fee, and I gotta tell you that's very handy as I'm going out on a trip

351
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,420
I don't have to worry about any of that stuff. Yeah, I'm gonna be using my phone a lot more

352
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,420
I'll just pay for what I use easy-peasy

353
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,260
No problemo if I get to a spot where I need hotspot or tethering I just check the box in the OS

354
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,940
I don't have to be part of some sort of mobile family share program

355
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,540
I don't have to pay some certain amount of data just in case I use a gigabyte

356
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,620
I just pay for what I use and I use the features built into the operating system

357
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:37,740
You want to use ting as a mobile ISP do it they like it. They don't care. They like it plus

358
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,380
They've got no whole customer service you call them a 1 8 5 5 ting FTW anytime between 8 a.m.. Or 8 p.m.. Boom

359
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:49,340
A real person answers the phone. I know it's crazy your mobile phone operator can actually help you because they've empowered their support staff

360
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:55,200
What a concept plus they have an incredible dashboard over to the last or linux.com don't go to last.com Noah

361
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,300
Except on Sundays well, that's true. That's true

362
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,780
Yeah, you know what you know what you know the last time I went to linux.com was

363
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,340
30 seconds ago well no

364
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:12,540
But but last right before I left I had this problem I the my wife helps me answer the phone for our company

365
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,900
Oh great. Yeah, well. She's with me. So she's gonna be hard to answer the phone right?

366
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,980
Yeah, so I hired a girl that was gonna answer the phone at the times that she wasn't gonna be available

367
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,860
Yeah, well now she has to have a phone right, but I can't give her a cell phone

368
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,580
I don't have an extra two hundred dollars to spend on a cell phone right and then I'd have nothing to do with it

369
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:31,300
Afterwards right so they have this home connect thing that I bought for like $30 off of eBay

370
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,100
Yeah, and with the BYOD bring it over I activate it

371
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,540
I plug a phone in and now she's got a phone in her apartment and a laptop six dollars month

372
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:41,060
That's right easy peasy. Yeah, and you can you can go in the dashboard. You can set alerts

373
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:46,220
Yeah, we we've hired a part-time nanny which turned out to be even cheaper than daycare which is great

374
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,800
But her phone service is super spotty well

375
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,060
She's got our kids sometimes so we want to have really make sure that she we can always send her a message always get her on

376
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,980
The phone so we're just gonna get her a great device from ting because then it's only six dollars a month

377
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,580
And it's just gonna be super cheap for text messaging it

378
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,740
There's all kinds of opportunities and possibilities go to linux.ting.com

379
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,220
That'll take $25 off your first device if you've got a device compatible with the ting network

380
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:12,180
I'll give you a $25 credit if you're like me that lasted more than my first month of service

381
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,620
I'll tell you what the first time I ever had a total free month of cell phone service

382
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,580
That was a special moment in my life

383
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,180
I will never forget that

384
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:23,260
Linux.ting.com go get a special moment in your life and see why I switched a ting

385
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,540
They've also got early termination relief programs if you're stuck in one of those

386
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,020
contracts linux.ting.com and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring

387
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,400
Linux unplugged

388
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,120
Okay, let's go back in time five years ago July 2009

389
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:42,100
That's not too long, but it's a long time in computer history right mm-hmm especially in internet time

390
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,260
You know here's a couple of things that happened in the Linux world

391
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,180
And then you guys jump in at any point if there's anything you want to nostalgia ties about

392
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:56,120
But let's talk about probably the one that just is the most relevant to the conversation. We're just having in July

393
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,260
2009 Google officially announced Google Chrome OS

394
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,380
They say we've designed Google Chrome for people who live on the web

395
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,660
Searching information checking email catching up on the news and shopping or just staying in touch with friends however

396
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:17,480
The operating system the browsers on the people browse on we're not designed in an era where there was a web so today

397
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:23,060
We're announcing a new project. That's a natural extension of Google Chrome the Google Chrome

398
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:30,620
Operating system in our attempt to rethink what an operating system should be so there you go five years ago

399
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,660
Google Chrome was born this month. Do you feel it does it feel like it was five years ago to you

400
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:39,580
Does you know I seem to remember all the going back and forth about how it's all well?

401
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:44,900
It's never gonna happen or you know the Google's never gonna actually do this sort of thing then it happened and everybody seemed to be

402
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,900
Almost in denial about there was a lot of room

403
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,340
Last Microsoft will squish them. You know no big deal five years ago

404
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:56,180
I don't think living in the cloud was as feasible as it is today, right? It's more crazy didn't it?

405
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,260
Yeah, I wasn't started

406
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:04,560
I was just starting a university at the time and then when they announced Chrome OS to actually be or Chrome

407
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,020
to be released I

408
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:11,180
Predicted they will make a friggin operating system based on Chrome

409
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:16,160
And that was right when they released Chrome when I first started University when they started Chrome OS

410
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,400
I was like yes, no I have don't have to build this damn thing on my own

411
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,980
They're gonna build it for me

412
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:25,540
Yeah, it was like gubuntu like a lot of people thought there'd be gu linux like they thought they were gonna do something

413
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,500
I'm going to call it talks box. I will admit this Joe's name

414
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,580
I don't know for sure, but I'm pretty sure I was a naysayer about because I just thought this was a dumb idea well

415
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,620
To me it seemed like netbooks reheated

416
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:43,460
I still think it's a dumb idea, but I think it's I think it's a dumb idea because I can't like I bought a pixel

417
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:48,860
I bought the nicest Chromebook money can buy right yeah, you did and I left Chrome on there for almost 30 seconds

418
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,860
Yeah, I tried yeah, yeah

419
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:56,060
It just doesn't I can't I can't live. I'm a I'm a traditional right word mouse right

420
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:01,220
Yeah, you ever just use Chrome OS like you have it on there you ever go back literally the first 30 seconds

421
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,580
I tried it just to see what it was like and then I

422
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,820
Went oh, I plugged in my thumb drive where I have all my files

423
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,300
Yeah, but they're encrypted with Lux so I couldn't get to them right and that was the end of Chrome OS

424
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,620
You know that's so funny

425
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:17,060
You say that because my experience with my c720 was I basically gave it about a minute 30 and at the end of that

426
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,860
I was like okay. Well. I can't get to this. I can't get to that all right time for arch. That was it

427
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,380
and I kind of regret it a little bit because I feel like maybe I should have given it a go because

428
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,260
Now that that was over a year ago now here

429
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,900
We are and now I'm going between the studio and the house all the time

430
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,660
mm-hmm and

431
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:38,740
There are there are more days than not that I just don't bring a computer with me when I move between places and I just have

432
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,780
Everything synchronized between the two locations

433
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:46,220
And I sit down here at a computer and I sit down there at a computer at the house and everything's there and some of that

434
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,980
Is because of Google Docs and Google Chrome sync and stuff right?

435
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:54,660
But the problem is you're gonna have to make significant compromises in the Fort Fisher project to be able to make that happen, right?

436
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,660
I got yeah, I know that's why

437
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,760
The good opportunity or advantage of Chrome OS is that you cannot have to worry about getting binary

438
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:07,360
updates from whoever gives you your updates you can patch or check at the source code or the

439
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:12,900
Freaking code and fix the problem yourself on the Chromebook if you really want to instead of needing binary packages all the time

440
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,860
Riley do you think this?

441
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,460
this last five years has been a hit to privacy I

442
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,260
Don't think it's actually a joke I would say this last five years has been I

443
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,300
Think unequivocally privacy out of all things that suffered the most in the last five years

444
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,740
So but you have to pray easily

445
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:37,060
You have to prioritize all right like if our goal as Linux users is to switch as many people as we can to Linux

446
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:42,100
But the I know that the fact runs in Linux and now everyone's going to stick us

447
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,140
Let's face it. You're only moving more and more towards browser-based application

448
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:50,500
The fact that Google Docs works as absolutely as well as it does under Windows or Mac is a huge win for your Linux

449
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,740
I had to ask myself a couple months ago when Matt back in the predictions Matt

450
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:57,080
Made the prediction that Chrome OS would be the new face of Linux, right?

451
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,580
And yeah, my I had to sit down and ask myself. Am I okay with it?

452
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,020
Would I be okay if when everyone thought of Linux?

453
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:10,180
They thought of Chrome OS and I'm okay with that up to the extent that things start happening for Chrome OS that don't translate to

454
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:15,380
Yeah, Netflix, right? Like why does Netflix work in Chrome when it's on a Chrome OS?

455
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:20,420
But if I install Chrome on my house, but then I know if that becomes more prolific then we have a problem

456
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,700
Then we're right back to where we started

457
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,620
Well, and you are starting to see that because now you're gonna have things like Evernote run under Chrome OS

458
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,620
But there's no Evernote for Linux. See that's bad. Yeah, that's really bad. That's actually worse than we were before

459
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:35,180
Yeah, because everyone hated Microsoft Windows. I don't think everyone's gonna hate Chrome because it won't hang up all the time

460
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:40,060
And it doesn't cost as much as well now, I mean if it's in Chrome

461
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:45,860
Theoretically anything they add to Chrome OS if it's actually in the Chrome browser could come to regular Linux eventually, right?

462
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:50,860
Well to kind of update the whole prediction thing here today and I forget exactly where I saw it

463
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,780
But basically there's a news article talking about how the it's actually up

464
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:02,780
250% as far as how they're selling and then the same comparable notebooks for Microsoft are just at a standstill

465
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:10,420
Yeah, so, you know the market's speaking loud and clear Microsoft's is they're gonna have a $99 Windows competitor by holidays

466
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:15,460
They have to they look at look at what the majority of home users are doing. They go on Facebook. They write letters

467
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:20,300
They check email. Yeah, they go on Spotify. They you know, and so if if those are the things that you're doing

468
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,580
Yeah, you can do that in a Chromebook. So why would you spend more than $200?

469
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:28,340
I say Microsoft should bring it because think about you know what those are all gonna become cheap Linux boxes

470
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:34,780
Most of them are gonna write eventually you become a Linux box make a $99 laptop. I'll run Linux on that. It won't take that long

471
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,300
All right

472
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:41,580
Yeah, exactly that's exactly what I would be thanks for the nice hardware Microsoft. Yeah

473
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,820
Let me let me just put Linux on that

474
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,140
All right

475
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,620
So also in July open SUSE 11.2 got firmed up

476
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:53,140
Sabi and 4.2 rocking it five years ago. In fact, there was a review of it

477
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:58,460
People thought it was maybe one of the best gnome desktops if you wanted comp is fusion

478
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:06,440
Yeah, crunch bang version 9.04 came out I don't let's go take a look

479
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,000
I q5 got us a little time machine link here. Let's go see what crunch bang was doing five years ago

480
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:17,460
Much improved boop. Oh, yeah boot time. Everybody was talking about boot time five years ago

481
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:23,340
Every distro was talking about boot time and that's when we were seeing upstart make its way throughout Linux

482
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:29,420
This transition over to transmission open box and GTK themes are now installed. You know made basic stuff

483
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,660
It's curious. It's curious to me to see which distros were we're still releasing back. Oh, we still talk

484
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,380
Right gotta have a JPEG turbo in there. Hey

485
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,380
Mozilla just announced their version of JPEG turbo that makes smaller. Yes. Yes

486
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:49,460
Yeah, and there was a there was an article at top of tech meme today about WebP from Google about why they want

487
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,460
WebP to take off

488
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,780
Hey Alan, you'll like this one five years ago

489
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,580
2009 PC BSD seven dot one dot one was released

490
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:04,860
This version was a maintenance release that they said this is the gale the gala gay

491
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:11,460
Oh, why can't I say Galileo Galileo version of PC BSD is the most stable release yet is what they said

492
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,700
It was seven dot one ten dot one is going to be amazeballs though. Oh, yeah

493
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,180
Is that when the new desktop

494
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,460
You can use the new desktop on ten dot o dot one as a beta

495
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:29,860
But I doubt it'll be ready in time ten dot one is like three months away at most. Oh, man

496
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,940
I'm it'll come out. It'll come out probably around the end of October beginning in November

497
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,020
I'm pretty interested to see what they do with that. It's all QT based you talked to

498
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,020
I

499
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:53,340
Think it's a little fancier. I think it's a little smoother Q5 sis was talking about it when he went to self. Okay

500
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,160
Yeah, he talked to Chris's brother who's working on it and it's all QT

501
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:04,060
Sounds from what I've heard and I don't know. I think I might have saw a little tease of it

502
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:09,140
It looked pretty impressive like way more polished than I was expecting for something this early on

503
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:16,180
Imagine PCB SD man, it lands with ZFS out of the box. This brand new QT desktop is pretty it's pretty nice

504
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,240
Right like PBI system

505
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,900
Starting to get pretty serious

506
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:26,580
You you won't really need the PB eyes unless you specifically want portable apps because the package manager in previous D has gotten so awesome

507
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,260
Now that you just use it. Well, there you go

508
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:36,460
But that's why PBI has been reformatted to be more like the Apple dmg's because the need for them is basically been supplanted by

509
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,540
The awesome work and now you know what Chris needs to do Chris Moore

510
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:46,080
He needs to mail Gabe at valve a PCB SD rig with a nice video card in it so we can get native. Yes

511
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:51,900
Yeah, yeah, we're working with the 64-bit Linux you later to be able to just run the Linux version. Yeah

512
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,540
There you go. Yeah

513
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:59,500
Already have better than make some video drivers. Oh snaps. Here we go. So

514
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:07,380
Speaking of snaps. Do you guys remember one of the early canonical controversies before the dashboard before unity?

515
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:12,960
Before buttons got moved to the left. Do you remember what we used to always get on canonical sack about?

516
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,880
Do you remember what the big controversy was what fucking Brown? Well the brown? Yeah, that's true. That is one of them

517
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,600
What could brown do for you? Yeah, no, but no actual controversial like canonical hates freedom because of they're doing this

518
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,040
It was a big upset. You ready anybody?

519
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,320
I'll give you a hint

520
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:36,200
It's something that the canonical project uses that no other open source project used at the time, but now it's a little more popular. Oh

521
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,560
What is it? I don't want to say launchpad. No, you're close those landscape

522
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,860
Landscape yeah landscape was the big upset. Well five years ago

523
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:51,940
I landscape this it's sort of like it's a bug tracker. It's a forum. It's a issue

524
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,460
It's all this stuff in one, you know, like go here. Here's the public

525
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,660
It's sort of like a everything host, you know, it's much better than all of that that we're moving towards

526
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,820
fabricator

527
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:08,420
It actually came out of Facebook, but the guy that created at Facebook spun it off in its own company

528
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,980
We're still using we just moved to bugzilla

529
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:16,260
So we're not gonna adopt it but it's a code review tool that also has bug tracker and a wiki and community and all this

530
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,940
Cool stuff, but just the way it handles code review and stuff makes it very very valuable for any open source project

531
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:29,820
So the they actually open sourced the code five years ago. They were under a free software. Actually, let's go

532
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,940
Look at that announcement q5 is by the way, a lot of the stuff we're talking about. Mr

533
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,940
Sis has linked us up in the show notes

534
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,900
So I was trying to remember I don't think they did GPL though

535
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:43,580
So it was still kind of an upset on this article doesn't say what the license was. That's too bad. That's too bad

536
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:49,580
It links to something else, but I do remember that being a big moment. Okay, moving on you ready for this one?

537
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:56,460
Amazon fails in its irony detection. I thought this is interesting as Linux users and polls George R

538
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,580
Orwell's

539
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:03,780
1984 directly out of Kindle ebooks that readers already had purchased you remember when they did this I wasn't a kid

540
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:07,100
I'm still not a Kindle user really but it was a big controversy. Yeah

541
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:12,220
Well, it was the publisher that made them do it for a reason wasn't I forget? Yeah. Yeah

542
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,420
Yeah, but they were getting sued but yes

543
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,540
It kind of it showed that you could buy something and then have it unbought

544
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:22,660
Well, and the thing was in the Linux community back then we were really grappling with DRM

545
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,860
What did all this DRM mean for Linux users?

546
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,540
should we as Linux users reject all things DRM and

547
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,140
this was sort of the

548
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:36,860
Like the key thing that all the anti DRM group which obviously it doesn't take much of the anti DRM

549
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:43,580
that that group would say look this is the perfect example of why DRM is a bad thing and the free software foundation jumped on

550
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:48,680
It and then you started to hear the swindle. That's where swindle came from was after this. That's where they coined the swindle term

551
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,580
It was huge

552
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:55,940
We talked about on the Linux action show even though it's not particularly Linux related because Linux users were so impacted by it

553
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:03,140
Mm-hmm, which I thought was I don't know. I I yeah, I remember that I remember going yeah, and I went back to reading my Kindle

554
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,140
Yeah

555
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,020
Like yeah, well, you know that sucks, but I mean it didn't affect me personally. I'm really selfish that way

556
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:14,500
I don't know why but it's like wow, it's not affecting me directly. I I just don't care

557
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,880
I I'm not really I'm not feeling the pain point that the other folks are feeling I guess well and also

558
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:24,680
You know you and I come down to it now because this the debate has been sort of reignited with steam games having DRM in

559
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:31,080
Them and well and Netflix if you want Netflix, it's gonna be HTML 5 a DRM, right, right and to me all of these things

560
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:38,480
They they fall into a category of like casual entertainment like as much as right like the same category that going to a movie

561
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,880
Falls into I don't get all worked up that I only go to see a movie once

562
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,560
But I still have pain like 30 bucks when I go to the theater to me

563
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,820
It is you know if you want it well

564
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,880
Well if you try to bring a backpack and they say well yeah

565
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,660
I feel differently sure they want to make sure that you don't record it

566
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,740
Listen the monkey wants to punch a button and have his entertainment and if they want to charge me a certain amount that is fair

567
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,520
Then the monkey will pay that amount and if the monkeys entertainment is wrapped up in a controlling scheme

568
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,960
It doesn't really matter because to be honest with you the monkey has a short attention span

569
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,440
And he's gonna move on to something else anyways and just because the monkey has a predilection to collect everything and hoard everything

570
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,880
Like some sort of squirrel preparing for the winter

571
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,240
It doesn't necessarily actually mean that is the thing you should be doing and perhaps maybe not having so much digital clutter is actually a good

572
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,460
Thing that's what the monkey thinks at least here's the other thing to you

573
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:29,000
So your your end goal or the the end goal or the the end idea would be that we'd all be able to use games

574
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
On any platform we wanted and they would all years

575
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,200
I could shut down ten years and they would all be there

576
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,200
I'm free but the reality is in order to get there

577
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:41,840
We have to take small bites small steps and the first step is to be able to actually run the games on Linux later after

578
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,640
We have all the software working and Linux becomes a usable platform for the majority of people then we can worry about

579
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:52,660
Finding better solutions that are more free, but at this point. I feel like the fact that steams on Linux at all yeah

580
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,780
Let's stop there. That's a huge right that for a year or two before we start complaining. Yeah

581
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,860
I think you know we're talking about five years ago. You go back five years

582
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,320
Nobody would have believed where I gave me now nobody it's unbelievable where we're at now

583
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,820
I mean just the fact we're talking about x-plane. I'm playing freaking x-plane, and it's awesome

584
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:12,740
I think x-plane I could be wrong on this, but I think x-plane actually had stronger Linux support

585
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,100
Yeah, because the flight schools all run Linux no

586
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,460
I know, but I'm just saying like there's these quality of games now right except five years ago

587
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:23,880
I'll just blow my mind that we have now. I remember like when y'all were making fun of her on it

588
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,060
We're always recording on being coming to run it

589
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,220
This will never happen

590
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:34,500
Actually, I think I actually kind of gave him a little I was coming down on the bit of I might believe it

591
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,540
I was starting after a while. There's a saying in the news business where there's enough smoke

592
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,900
There's probably a fire and it started to see like there's a lot of smoke

593
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:45,300
Here's something like Veronica like a report something like nobody would believe it

594
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,440
Well, yeah

595
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:52,800
Cuz they were pulling what he was doing early on where Michael got onto it early on this is probably about two three years ago

596
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:59,120
Was he was finding like like screenshots or something in the windows binary or something like he was taking stuff apart

597
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,200
Or like the installer and finding references to Linux

598
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,960
That's how it started and everybody was like they just explained it away as oh that was just for some testing stuff

599
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,080
I don't pay any attention to that valve doesn't even have a Linux developer on staff

600
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,740
That's what everybody was saying. They don't even have any developers in staff

601
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,080
Sorry go no you go you go

602
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,640
I was gonna say I'm sure there was a period where Michael was saying that he was

603
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,640
Going into valves offices and talking to them about it

604
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:40,720
But that he wasn't allowed to relay exactly what he was talking about, you know to anyone but just simply going it is happening

605
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,560
I promise you I've gone in and seen it, but I can't show you any kind of real proof or anything like that

606
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:52,580
Right. Yeah, that's always people, you know, then that depends on your reputation and everybody has a different interpretation of that

607
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,320
Hey, so we're working on more retro look back. So we're just getting started. This is just a new concept

608
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:02,800
We came up with our episode 50. Let's let's celebrate our 50th episode by doing just a little look back over

609
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,480
The history of Linux and we want to do one next month too

610
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:11,080
So if something happened a few years ago in August that you thinks was a sentimental moment or maybe even not just something that's fun

611
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,080
To talk about in the Linux space

612
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,840
Email us go over to Jupiter broadcasting comm click the contact link and send it into Linux unplugged

613
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,480
You might see it in next month's retro look back

614
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,600
We're gonna try to do this from time to time if you guys like it

615
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,800
So you got to let us know because you're the boss

616
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,120
Hey before we get to the end of the show and I got I got a little question and maybe a problem the audience can

617
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,120
Help me solve. I know our audience. I know somebody out

618
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:38,560
There is a Thunderbird user who is empowered to solve my problem and it's a big problem. What's the problem?

619
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,360
Well, I'm gonna tell you after the ad spot cuz first I'm gonna talk about Linux Academy another problem that Linux Academy solves

620
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:48,880
Are you busy? Are you a busy person like me and are you sometimes wondering if you're in the right groove?

621
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,240
Are you working on the right product? Are you doing the right type of technology?

622
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,640
Do you should get into web services should you get into OpenStack or virtualization?

623
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,840
Do you want to just kind of see how other distributions work or do you want to take your skills to the next level?

624
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,840
Well, then go over to linuxacademy.com

625
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,880
Unplugged that'll get you the summer of learning discount

626
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,040
This is a great opportunity to take your skills to the next level make you more employable

627
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:18,760
Make that next review have an extra checkmark that said you accomplish this thing or give yourself the opportunity to expand your skills

628
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,760
Like take Noah here. He's a Red Hat guy. Let's say he got thrust into the Ubuntu world

629
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:31,600
Well, one of the great things about linuxacademy.com is you have seven plus Linux distributions to choose from whichever distribution you choose the courseware

630
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:38,560
Automatically adjust to that distribution. They have comprehensive study guides that you can download mp3s video. They have self-paced courses

631
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,560
You see exactly where you at

632
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,200
So if you you work for maybe a half hour

633
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,200
You'll log off for the night you come back a couple of days later

634
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,640
You can resume right where you're at you see your percentage if you feel like you need to double-check yourself

635
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,360
They have self-testing a community that will keep you motivated and on the right track

636
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:56,640
And if you go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, you'll get that 33% discount

637
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,400
That's $50 a quarter and they're adding new stuff every single week new AWS courses

638
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:07,360
If you got an AWS gig coming up go do a scenario based lesson on it learn by actually deploying a web-based

639
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,400
AWS application and on the back end they'll spin up the virtual machines for you. Now. Here's a question

640
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,000
Do they have instructors that you can ask questions? Oh, yeah

641
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,360
They've got they've got a full crew and they've also started recently doing like live sessions

642
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:24,280
So you can go there and ask questions and interact with them and then they'll make the video available if you weren't able to attend

643
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,720
The live session later on so it's a really cool like back and forth and it gives you an opportunity to ask because they're real

644
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,000
You know

645
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,640
They're educators when I when I first started when I first started doing professional training

646
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:37,360
One of the things that really bothered me was I had to block off an entire week of work

647
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,560
To go do this

648
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,120
And then the other thing was to is because you were in a classroom full of other students

649
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:47,400
You would ask the structure a question and he would tell you, you know, go grow up a man page. That's not really helpful

650
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,400
No, it's not is it?

651
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,320
No, I can do that at home and send it

652
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:56,040
You know an email in and then get a response and then read that when I have time and move on that's appealing one

653
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,580
Of the things I found that I've really liked with my subscription is I hear about something new and it's like well

654
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:04,640
Why don't I just go jump in for a half hour and see how much of this technology I grok and see if I have an

655
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:09,680
Innate talent for it and it's really cool because I don't have to spend the time of setting up the VM

656
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,720
Loading the software stack and all that's like when I just I just go through the course material

657
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,720
I get the fundamentals and when it comes to that spot

658
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,580
They manage that part for me and what's awesome is if that's on AWS

659
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:24,160
They're covering all the cost of that too. So I'm not paying out of pocket while I'm learning AWS

660
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,160
I just go right over to linuxacademy.com slash dumb plug get the summer of learning discount

661
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,320
This is a great sponsor for our network

662
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,320
I'd love to have you guys support them because I

663
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:38,040
They're an independent team who have built this system from scratch and we're an independent team who have built our system from scratch

664
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:43,760
and it's really cool for us to be able to connect together and work together in a common area like this linuxacademy.com slash

665
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:52,200
Well Noah you're here and you sent in that awesome runs Linux from the radio station. I'm glad you enjoyed it

666
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,900
It's at the benchmark man. You set the benchmark, you know

667
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:59,040
I've been making a call to have people send in their runs Linux like a YouTube you did a perfect

668
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:05,280
Yeah, you took the YouTube you took a video you uploaded it to YouTube sent in the link and or you submitted to the subreddit

669
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,200
I did. Yeah, even better because I'm more likely to see it than email. Yeah

670
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:14,200
That worked really well. Honestly, I didn't I've given up with you an email and I like completely yeah, totally

671
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,200
That's right. You've got other methods

672
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,480
I'm trying to help after all

673
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,600
I don't know. I think I mentioned in the show, but did you edit that on your pixel?

674
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,300
Uh, no, okay. I have a production rig, but you know on Ubuntu though. Yes. Yep

675
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,800
No, but everything everything from start to finish was done on Linux

676
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:51,120
Even even even the glass that everyone likes so much even that at its core is technically running Linux. That's true. That's true

677
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:56,120
Very nice. How is it working with light words? I know you've been doing it more and more. Yeah, it's we actually switch

678
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,520
So we do professional video editing and we actually we just switched

679
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,600
Well, actually a couple months ago, but we switched to all light works based and on Linux. So yeah

680
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:11,200
There's no longer any proprietary. Well proprietary operating systems running. Yeah, they call it open source, but it's really not

681
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,840
It's a very liberal, but you get to use it on top of Linux. Yeah, which is what I care about, right? Yeah

682
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,680
Yeah, I've got light works installed here on the bonobo and I've been doing a couple of custom projects here and there on it

683
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,160
But I just haven't gotten enough time in it. It's a pretty big change up from what I'm used to

684
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:30,680
I'm come from a previous editor. I did I so when I went when I went to school for for for broadcasting

685
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,200
We used obviously Final Cut. Yeah, and then when I was done

686
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,960
I spent half my time in Adobe Premiere and half my time in Sony Vegas and

687
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,560
Between the two I didn't really have

688
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,920
And when I went to light works it like I swear some developer at edit share sat down where they're like

689
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,200
What is the most confusing way we could lay out a GUI?

690
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:52,520
Yeah people to use and then right they made it a little more complicated and then that's what they went with because it doesn't work

691
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:59,520
Like any other NLE out there. No, but once you get in the way of light works editing, I wouldn't go back really

692
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,760
Oh, absolutely. Oh that gives me some encouragement. It's I look at it almost like an operating system

693
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,480
Well, it's neat is because it like takes over your screen. Yeah, it doesn't matter if you're using it on Windows Mac or Linux

694
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,720
Everything else that applies

695
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:16,240
Dig that thing is for me is it's so different and I don't necessarily think it's different in a good way

696
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,000
Yeah, it was hard for me. Yeah, it was one of those things too

697
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,640
I walked away from the computer two or three times and I went that's it. I'm done. Never going back. I'm not using this

698
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:28,200
Really? Yeah, it took a while. Oh, man. Yeah, I'm a little conflicted

699
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,240
But I'm gonna what I figure is I'll just keep working on like little projects that I just don't like it's not critical that

700
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,120
if things go wrong and that's fine, and I'll just keep poking away at it over time and

701
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,840
We'll see I'll give you guys a report. Maybe I'll do a review soon

702
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:44,320
Hey before we wrap I wanted to ask and I'll ask the mumble room in the post show

703
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,320
But I wanted to ask you out there in the audience

704
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,960
What are your tricks to work with Thunderbird?

705
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,760
Because you know

706
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,600
I am serious about this fortress Chris and I think one of the things is when I move off of Google apps for Jupiter broadcasting

707
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,880
I'm probably gonna be using Thunderbird primarily

708
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,200
The other reason I want to use Thunderbird is I really dig the GPG encryption

709
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,880
Plugin tools and I want to get more into that too. And so the two go hand in hand

710
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:10,680
But there's a few things I have that bother me about Thunderbird and you got to keep in mind

711
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:17,680
I'm trying to use it at a scale where maybe each inbox is getting 50 to 120 emails a day

712
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,040
And maybe there's four or five inboxes. So it's it's it's at a scale where you need to build a process

713
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,040
So my question for the audience is is what?

714
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:29,640
Extensions what tips and tricks do you have themes anything to make Thunderbird rock?

715
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,120
And I know some of you're gonna be like Thunderbird rock that doesn't even make any sense

716
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,640
But if you're using it, you know what I mean? What do you do to make a rock?

717
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,100
Do you have any do you use Thunderbird anything? Oh, yeah, that's all yeah

718
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:43,120
That's my email flight what them I'll tell you the main bugaboo and I'll ask the mumble post show

719
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:50,680
But the main bugaboo for me, this is huge dude for me is in Gmail and outlook you get in the actual message list

720
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,960
I'm not talking the preview box. I'm talking in the message list

721
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,540
You get like a one or three line preview of the email

722
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,040
Sure

723
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:01,600
and the reason why that's critical is because you can get a quick sense of what the email might be about without clicking it and

724
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,840
Thus marking it red because of course my system is if it's red that's processed if it's unread it's not processed

725
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,920
So if I click something just to get a sense of what it's about and I don't want to respond to at that moment

726
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,600
I will never go back to it again because it's now marked red. Mm-hmm

727
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,240
I swear there used to be a way in Thunderbird to get that preview

728
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,160
I swear

729
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,680
So I just want to get tips and tricks and I might do like a little collection on the Linux action show of things

730
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,040
I did to make Thunderbird work well for me going back

731
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,520
So snake doc says that Thunderbirds capable of it. I know yeah, I think so too, but I can't figure out how well

732
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,720
Apparently snake doc does know how well snake doc smarter than I am. Yeah

733
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:39,460
Yeah, maybe you could do a team viewer sessions and and and system administrate your computer. That'd be a great idea

734
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,560
What could go wrong with that, right?

735
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,440
Hey

736
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:49,320
So I I'm gonna be out at OSCON well with Noah and Eric and while I'm gone Tuesday and Wednesday

737
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:53,460
I've I've pre-taped two episodes of tech talk today Tuesday's episode is great

738
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,440
We've got some Tesla security information in there

739
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:02,200
Which is actually Linux related and some really deep dive into like the dirty details of some of the Google quarterly results

740
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:07,840
But on Wednesday, this is the one you guys are gonna want to tune into tech talk today on Wednesday is a retrospective

741
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:15,480
look back at the birth the humble beginnings of the internet and from ARPANET up to the proto podcaster we take about a

742
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,520
About a 15 year span of the early humble beginnings of the internet and just go deep dive into that

743
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,320
It turned out to be such a fun episode. That'll be out on Wednesday

744
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:28,500
I think it's gonna be episode 31 of tech talk today. So go check that out. I think you guys really like it

745
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:32,940

Right there in the feedback thread. We want to read it. We want to talk about it

754
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,160
We want to chew on it spit it up

755
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,560
Gurgitate it and then put it back into your ear hole kind of like a mom to her baby birds

756
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,560
But instead of their mouth their ear holes

757
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,520
Yeah, it's an interesting analogy. Yeah

758
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:27,280
All right, well I know thanks for joining us in studio today thanks for having it was it was great having you here

759
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,160
It's always good to have an in-studio guest Matt. I'm looking forward to seeing you on Sunday

760
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,720
I'll have OSCON stories for you. Okay, sweet. All right. I'll see you then all right everyone

761
00:55:35,720 --> 00:56:05,040
Thanks so much for to this week's episode of Linux unplugged. We'll see you right back here next Tuesday

762
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,720
I

763
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:30,360
Already got a tip from the chat room about the fun the Thunderbird thing, but it didn't work

764
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:34,640
I went to the message pane and I checked the message message pane thing layout

765
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,760
It's I hear I'll show you here's what my Thunderbird inbox looks like right now

766
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:43,560
So if you're watching this, this is my Thunderbird inbox and see what I want is in the list here in this list

767
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,880
I want it's like a three

768
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,800
I want each basically each mail item to take up an extra couple of rows and give me inline previews a little bit

769
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,800
That's what I want

770
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:57,640
Like gmail does gmail does I swear Thunderbird used to do that guy's email doesn't do that sure it does yeah

771
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:04,640
I know but what I would say there is a couple things. Um, I do you like the wide

772
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:10,760
I'm sure I was trying it. Yeah, I bounce around the wide one is just for people that were coming from I look

773
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,520
Yeah, yeah

774
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,680
I just was trying it to see if I turned it on because I know outlook has that mode

775
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:22,280
Like I used the threaded thing instead and you know when I like half my screen is a message preview

776
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:27,280
Although I I work the same way you do with the market is red except I have my setting is don't mark

777
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,100
The email is red until I actually mark it mark it that might be a way to do it

778
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:35,960
I suppose there's also an option to just say don't mark it in red unless I've read it for at least 30 seconds

779
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:43,280
Yeah, maybe that's why I hate that setting sometimes because sometimes I don't but sometimes I want to just click it

780
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,120
And I also want to mark it red really but I could just do the markers red button

781
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,120
I might try just change it up like that

782
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,120
What I do is your screens not so

783
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,680
But on mine in the list of messages

784
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:02,600
There's a little green circle a little green light beside each message and if you just click the light it marks it. Yeah, that's true

785
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:08,480
Yeah, I can turn that you know what I like about you over over users that I support is when you say I have problem

786
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,480
a if I go

787
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:13,600
We'll change your workflow to be and then you'll be able to do that. You're not like well, that's not what I asked you to fix

788
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:18,320
I don't mind changing. Yeah, that's really helpful
