00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
Guys, I just got a new little surprise at the door here, some new hardware.

00:04.200 --> 00:08.740
It did not arrive via DHS, so that was what I was going to ask next.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.540
But but Alex did help me get this.

00:12.540 --> 00:13.540
It's a Alex.

00:13.540 --> 00:14.900
You don't even know this yet.

00:14.900 --> 00:19.300
X 250 used just came in my door and I unboxed it.

00:19.300 --> 00:24.940
And it has a pro Windows sticker on it, which might have to come up right away.

00:25.040 --> 00:28.800
And my display port looks like it has a dent in it.

00:28.800 --> 00:30.360
But I'm not very happy about.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.500
But oh, no, but we'll see.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.800
So this is a new upgrade for me.

00:34.800 --> 00:37.040
I'm going from X to 20 to 50.

00:37.040 --> 00:42.600
And Alex and I, when I'm there later this week in Raleigh, we're going to switch out

00:42.600 --> 00:45.560
the monitor and IPS and do a whole bunch of stuff to it.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.060
So we'll see how that adventure goes.

00:47.060 --> 00:51.160
Are you telling me you're going to crack open a brand new ThinkPad and replace the screen

00:51.160 --> 00:52.960
with a different one? Yes.

00:52.960 --> 00:55.240
Yeah, I don't even know if I'm going to boot it first.

00:55.240 --> 00:56.860
I'm just going to kind of I love you guys.

00:56.860 --> 00:58.240
Why wouldn't you do that?

00:58.240 --> 01:01.060
What possible reason could you not do that?

01:01.060 --> 01:02.760
You know, I think we have some work to do, Chris.

01:02.760 --> 01:06.240
No, I want to see what it looks like when it's all said and done.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.060
Here's the thing, right?

01:07.060 --> 01:12.500
I mean, in terms of bang for buck, we were looking at two, I think an X 270.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.340
And that came out at five hundred dollars or so.

01:15.340 --> 01:19.960
This 250 came out, I think, Brent, correct me if I'm wrong, like 250, something like that.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.640
Two twenty. Two twenty US.

01:21.640 --> 01:22.900
OK, so even cheaper. Great.

01:22.900 --> 01:26.800
And then by the time we've done the upgrades and stuff, you know, you're looking at just

01:26.800 --> 01:28.640
approaching three hundred dollars.

01:28.640 --> 01:33.260
And for Brent, this is like a 60 percent speed bump over his X 220.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.800
So, yeah, we did the comparison.

01:34.800 --> 01:38.560
It's like it's it's easy to say yes to something like that.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.160
And who doesn't love an old ThinkPad?

01:40.160 --> 01:41.440
Hey, it's new to me.

01:41.440 --> 01:44.860
What do you have on your existing system CPU wise and what are you going to?

01:44.860 --> 01:48.360
Well, right now I'm on an X 220.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.300
It's got an I3 in it.

01:50.300 --> 01:53.440
I am hoping Alex can remember the exact.

01:53.440 --> 01:58.300
It's the potato version of the I3, the really, really like the baby one.

01:58.300 --> 02:03.040
Yes, the potato. And therefore I have lots of room to grow, I guess.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.360
He was surprised that I could do as much magic as I can on a potato.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.900
But it seems potatoes are pretty good.

02:07.900 --> 02:09.260
Alex is not alone.

02:09.260 --> 02:13.660
That is one of the number one things I probably haven't vocalized when I've been around you is I am

02:13.660 --> 02:16.560
amazed at the work you get done on the machine you have now.

02:16.560 --> 02:18.700
Well, thank you. It's not what you got.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.100
It's how you use it.

02:20.100 --> 02:24.160
I'll be curious if you get sloppy now that you've upgraded a bit, you know.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.200
I think the improved screen is a big deal.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.060
I think that IPS display is going to make a huge difference for you, Brent.

02:29.060 --> 02:30.200
Absolutely.

02:30.200 --> 02:33.440
As a photographer, the IPS was a must.

02:33.440 --> 02:38.100
And it's hard to find ThinkPads that are IPSs that are also in good condition and all this other stuff.

02:38.100 --> 02:44.840
Right. So when Alex suggested that we could just swap it out and upgrade the resolution on the monitor, I was all in.

02:44.840 --> 02:58.300
Yeah, you currently have an i3-2350M chip, which is from Q4 2013, and you're going to an i7-5600U, which is from Q1 2015.

02:58.300 --> 03:02.500
So it's still two cores, four threads, but it's going from Sandy Bridge to Broadwell.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.400
So there's a significant architectural change there.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.460
And like we said, a 60 percent speed bump.

03:07.460 --> 03:09.200
So I think you're going to enjoy it.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.940
This also gives you a bump in RAM, right?

03:10.940 --> 03:13.400
Yes. In RAM, currently I'm using 8 gigs.

03:13.400 --> 03:19.500
I know this X220 can handle 16 and 8 gigs allows me to suffer quite regularly.

03:19.500 --> 03:24.100
Therefore, I will be looking towards upgrading quite quickly, for sure.

03:31.840 --> 03:36.400
Hello, friends, and welcome into a very special edition of your Unplugged program.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.860
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello there, Wes.

03:38.860 --> 03:41.740
Hello. It is very special. It is quite, isn't it?

03:41.740 --> 03:51.400
This week, we're just talking about one thing, which is two things, technically three things, but just this one thing.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.740
If there are just two things you love about your distro, I want to know about them.

03:54.740 --> 03:59.000
But if there's one thing you could change to make it perfect, to make it better, what would it be?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.100
That's what we'll ask everyone on our panel today.

04:01.100 --> 04:04.100
So let's bring them all in. Hello there, Cheese and Alex.

04:04.100 --> 04:06.000
Hello, guys. Hello.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.800
Hello, Chris. I'm going to say hello to you directly today instead of last time, where you got all upset because I said hello, internet.

04:11.800 --> 04:15.000
Alex, I don't even know what you're talking about. It just sounds ridiculous.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.400
Who could possibly be upset by that?

04:16.400 --> 04:19.400
Ridiculous.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.400
Hello, Mumble. Roomtime appropriate greetings.

04:21.400 --> 04:22.800
Hello, internet. Good evening.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.500
Howdy. Hello.

04:24.500 --> 04:25.100
Wow.

04:25.100 --> 04:27.100
Whoa.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.100
Oh, my.

04:28.100 --> 04:33.000
Wes said, after the show last week, he said, how many people do you think will show up in Mumble for the special recording?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.600
And I said, five people.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.100
That's not what happened at all.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.200
I think you were wrong there, buddy.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.500
You guys are so awesome.

04:38.500 --> 04:41.300
So thank you so much for being here this week.

04:41.300 --> 04:47.600
We wanted to do a special recording because I am traveling, taking care of the business, as I do, Wes.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.200
You know me.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.400
You're important. Yeah, we know.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.200
I got to take care of the business, Wes.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.400
I don't know what that business is.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.600
I believe you say TCB. You're saying that all the time.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.200
Yeah, take care of the business.

04:56.200 --> 05:00.100
That's what I say. I say it. But that's also a yogurt, isn't it?

05:00.100 --> 05:01.500
I think. I don't know.

05:01.500 --> 05:05.200
So this week, we're going to do something a little different than the regular show.

05:05.200 --> 05:09.700
We're going to just focus in on what we love about the distributions that we use.

05:09.700 --> 05:15.500
And we're going to kind of go around the horn here and see what each of us loves about the distributions we've chosen.

05:15.500 --> 05:18.200
And maybe the one thing we could make.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.600
Just a small tweak.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.500
Maybe if we had a magic wand, we could change something to make it better.

05:22.500 --> 05:25.700
Now, I want to make it really clear here at the top.

05:25.700 --> 05:30.200
There is no perfect distribution yet.

05:30.200 --> 05:34.400
Now, by the time we're done with this episode, I'm pretty sure we'll have a perfect distribution.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.400
I mean, clearly, we're going to solve it right now.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.800
We can do it, I believe.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.700
But I just want to keep that in mind.

05:40.700 --> 05:43.300
We're really just here to share. This is going to be positive stuff.

05:43.300 --> 05:48.400
This is what we love about the distributions we've chosen to use.

05:48.400 --> 05:55.100
Having really myself started, started with Red Hat, tried Debian.

05:55.100 --> 06:00.200
I think I really fell in love with Linux once I started using Debian.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.800
With Red Hat, it felt like a tool.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.300
And with Debian, it felt like it was solving problems for me.

06:05.300 --> 06:05.800
You know what I mean?

06:05.800 --> 06:08.400
Just flexible enough that you could use it for anything?

06:08.400 --> 06:10.700
It was apt.

06:10.700 --> 06:11.500
100% apt.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.700
That's an interesting theme.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.500
I think we'll hear more about package management today.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.800
When did you start?

06:17.800 --> 06:22.300
How new were package managers and were they any good at that point?

06:22.300 --> 06:27.100
I think he just called you old.

06:27.100 --> 06:29.800
I think, Chris, he's trying to date you.

06:29.800 --> 06:30.400
I know.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.400
I know.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.400
I'm like, wow, man.

06:32.400 --> 06:36.900
Well, it did feel like computer magic, like the fact that apt could just

06:36.900 --> 06:40.200
figure out that one package depended on these other packages, which

06:40.200 --> 06:43.900
could possibly depend on additional packages.

06:43.900 --> 06:45.400
That felt very new.

06:45.400 --> 06:49.200
It was definitely mid to late 90s.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.800
Apt was introduced into Debian in 99.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.000
The first release was in 98.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.600
Okay, sounds about right.

06:56.600 --> 07:01.600
It was definitely kind of magical because just a year later, it got

07:01.600 --> 07:05.100
forked and ported to RPM distros, which is how Connectiva had it.

07:05.100 --> 07:09.100
They were a fork of Red Hat that used apt instead of up-to-date.

07:09.100 --> 07:13.400
And I remember Yellow Dog Linux had like the...

07:13.400 --> 07:15.000
There was two things.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.600
There was two distros back then that really had solved RPMs.

07:18.600 --> 07:23.600
Like Debian had a totally different approach, but Mandrake had URPMI.

07:23.600 --> 07:27.500
Yellow Dog had the Yellow Dog Update Manager, yum.

07:27.500 --> 07:32.700
And those two had really kind of solved using RPMs, whereas Debian

07:32.700 --> 07:34.400
had gone a totally different route.

07:34.400 --> 07:40.100
And looking back at it, yum survived and then became DNF, but URPMI,

07:40.100 --> 07:43.100
which was the Mandrake approach, kind of just died off.

07:43.100 --> 07:46.700
So here's an interesting factoid that I think a lot of people don't

07:46.700 --> 07:46.900
know.

07:46.900 --> 07:52.100
URPMI and apt were released the same year within a month of each other.

07:52.100 --> 07:57.900
They were the first ever dependency-resolving repository software

07:57.900 --> 08:02.700
managers for the Unix world, or arguably all of the computer

08:02.700 --> 08:03.600
operating system world.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.700
They're obviously predecessors of different types and whatnot, but

08:06.700 --> 08:09.600
like of the specific kind that we understand as package managers

08:09.600 --> 08:11.200
today, those two were the first.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.700
And Yellow Dog had the Yellow Dog Update, or YUP, which got forked

08:15.700 --> 08:18.600
to become the Yellow Dog Updater Modified, yum.

08:18.600 --> 08:24.100
And that one was the one that we all know won out in the RPM world

08:24.100 --> 08:27.300
and eventually became, we have the dandified Yellow Dog Updater,

08:27.300 --> 08:28.500
which is DNF.

08:28.500 --> 08:32.600
Alright, now, before we go too much further down the package route,

08:32.600 --> 08:36.500
because I think it's going to come up again in the show, let's talk

08:36.500 --> 08:39.700
about what some of our favorite distributions are and what it is

08:39.700 --> 08:41.500
about those distributions that we love.

08:41.500 --> 08:44.500
And I wanted to give each person in the Mumble Room a chance to

08:44.500 --> 08:47.100
chime in. So, Ace Nomad, let's start with you.

08:47.100 --> 08:50.100
What distribution is your distro of choice and what is it about it

08:50.100 --> 08:50.500
that you love?

08:50.500 --> 08:55.500
I'm running Kabuntu on pretty much all of my main machines and I,

08:55.500 --> 09:00.100
for the most part, just use it for KDE.

09:00.100 --> 09:02.800
I'm kind of distro agnostic.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.900
My passion comes from KDE.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.300
I can understand that.

09:07.300 --> 09:09.300
I mean, it's a great desktop environment.

09:09.300 --> 09:14.100
Mr. Brent Foto, I imagine a bit of it has to do with Plasma yourself.

09:14.100 --> 09:16.000
Well, it's actually your fault.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.100
You kind of dared many of us to give Plasma a try, I think, like a

09:21.100 --> 09:22.600
year and a half to two years ago.

09:22.600 --> 09:29.300
And at the time, I was using Linux Mint Cinnamon version, which was

09:29.300 --> 09:30.200
working fairly well for me.

09:30.200 --> 09:34.800
And I am more in a production style system, I'll call it.

09:34.800 --> 09:39.900
But I was like, oh, well, I haven't tried KDE in like a decade.

09:39.900 --> 09:46.300
And so gave it a try using Entergos and basically fell in love.

09:46.300 --> 09:48.800
And I've been in love ever since.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.100
And it's been quite an amazing ride.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.600
So I've really enjoyed that setup.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.200
Same.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.700
He showed me his laptop at Texas Linux Fest when I met him last

09:56.700 --> 09:58.900
year. This being him being Chris, by the way.

09:58.900 --> 10:03.200
And yeah, he had a really, really nice setup.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.000
I think it was an XPS 13 at that point.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.400
He had it on and KDE Plasma 5 since then has just been my desktop

10:10.400 --> 10:11.700
daily driver ever since.

10:11.700 --> 10:13.900
It's been really, really solid.

10:13.900 --> 10:18.800
I have typically reached for XFCE or Cinnamon, generally for the

10:18.800 --> 10:21.400
lower resource part of it.

10:21.400 --> 10:26.500
I was really surprised, really surprised with Plasma 5 and just

10:26.500 --> 10:28.300
how wonderfully it runs on this potato.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.200
So it's just so solid.

10:30.200 --> 10:34.000
I know and yet customizable in a way that I really appreciate,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.800
especially with some of the photo workflow that I do.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.400
It's nice to have Windows always coming up in the right places.

10:39.400 --> 10:44.300
You can almost grow closer to it than other other managers because

10:44.300 --> 10:45.300
you can change it so much, right?

10:45.300 --> 10:46.100
You really make it your own.

10:46.100 --> 10:47.100
It fits like a glove.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.100
Yeah, certainly.

10:48.100 --> 10:52.300
I feel the only problem now is that because I'm I'm needing to

10:52.300 --> 10:53.300
move to some new hardware.

10:53.300 --> 10:59.800
I'm feeling very afraid of changing the setup because I've grown

10:59.800 --> 11:00.700
into it so much.

11:00.700 --> 11:03.700
There's just it's almost like I know everything about it and it

11:03.700 --> 11:04.700
knows everything about me.

11:04.700 --> 11:06.700
It's like a pair of comfortable shoes.

11:06.700 --> 11:12.300
I actually think that something that is worth commenting about is

11:12.300 --> 11:14.200
so about two years, right?

11:14.200 --> 11:15.400
About two years of using it.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.800
That's several different versions of that desktop environment.

11:18.800 --> 11:22.800
And it's mostly carried forward all of the settings, I would

11:22.800 --> 11:25.100
assume. So it hasn't really disrupted your workflow, even though

11:25.100 --> 11:26.800
it's been updating pretty frequently.

11:26.800 --> 11:31.200
One thing I wanted really fundamentally from a rolling release.

11:31.200 --> 11:36.900
I was a little bit tired when I jumped into this from doing upgrades

11:36.900 --> 11:41.500
and having that disruption in my production, which is also, you

11:41.500 --> 11:42.800
know, comes with a little bit of fun too.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.600
But there's something about having this solid machine that I can

11:45.600 --> 11:46.500
depend on all the time.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.100
And I wasn't quite sure how that experience would go.

11:49.100 --> 11:54.300
But now two years in, I'm, you know, I've hit very few problems

11:54.300 --> 11:58.000
that have really got me to my knees in that respect.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.800
And so it's been a real treat to see it evolve because of course

12:01.800 --> 12:05.600
new features are coming all the time, but not evolve in a way that

12:05.600 --> 12:06.800
makes me dislike it.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.500
It's been just more and more features and more pleasing really.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.800
I have a question for both you and Alex.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.100
Brent, you first.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.600
How often are you running updates?

12:17.600 --> 12:20.200
Yeah, I'll give you the best case and worst case.

12:20.200 --> 12:25.500
So how often typically I do about once a week if I'm in a place

12:25.500 --> 12:26.500
that has good Wi-Fi.

12:26.500 --> 12:31.100
Now as many of you know, I travel quite a bit and so I tend not to

12:31.100 --> 12:35.000
do the updates while I'm traveling both because I don't want to

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
eventually introduce problems, but mostly because I'm relying on

12:39.000 --> 12:43.800
some mobile Wi-Fi and usually I can wait like a week or two to do

12:43.800 --> 12:47.300
updates in a place where I can have time and space and a good

12:47.300 --> 12:48.600
internet connection to deal with that.

12:48.600 --> 12:53.800
But I will admit these days I'm running out of disk space in a way

12:53.800 --> 12:57.100
that I need to desperately fix and so I haven't run an update.

12:57.100 --> 12:58.100
Chris, you're going to love this.

12:58.100 --> 12:59.900
I haven't run an update.

12:59.900 --> 13:02.500
It's embarrassing.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.500
It's almost like since maybe the sprint.

13:05.500 --> 13:07.200
Really?

13:07.200 --> 13:08.800
I did not expect that.

13:08.800 --> 13:13.800
Which is in August, late August, and I'm afraid now.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.300
What are you doing after the show, Brent?

13:15.300 --> 13:16.300
I mean, it's probably time.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.300
What do you say about the post show there, Brent?

13:18.300 --> 13:24.200
Really, I will bring up how many packages are in need of update

13:24.200 --> 13:25.800
and we can talk about that.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.000
What about you, Alex?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.800
How often are you hitting the old update there?

13:28.800 --> 13:31.800
Every single day, multiple times a day, honestly.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.500
It's Arch, so that's why I have it.

13:34.500 --> 13:38.700
You know, I just have a muscle reflex that I type yay every time

13:38.700 --> 13:40.000
I sit down at a blank terminal.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.400
I don't know why, I just do it.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.400
You're kidding me.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.100
Multiple times a day for real?

13:44.100 --> 13:44.700
Yeah, why not?

13:44.700 --> 13:46.800
I mean, yeah, there's always fresh stuff.

13:46.800 --> 13:47.900
You don't even want to see what updates.

13:47.900 --> 13:49.800
Because I don't know.

13:49.800 --> 13:50.400
It makes sense.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.900
It reduces the amount of churn you have to deal with each day.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.900
You're doing it multiple times and taking them in smaller chunks.

13:55.900 --> 13:57.100
Makes it more manageable.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.500
But every now and then, it's something massive.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.400
I don't do it before I need to record a show, though.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.200
I'm not okay, and I'm not crazy like that.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.800
It almost sounds like it's a tick.

14:06.800 --> 14:07.800
Yeah, it is.

14:07.800 --> 14:13.000
So, Brent, you're worried about not updating since the end of August, okay?

14:13.000 --> 14:17.300
When I put this system, when I emigrated last year, I put this system in a box

14:17.300 --> 14:22.800
and then I put it on a container ship for the best part of four, four and a half months.

14:22.800 --> 14:26.100
The Arch install that came out the other end was like a time capsule.

14:26.100 --> 14:27.000
It was really strange.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.400
Like, I went back into my home directory and it was exactly as I left it in August.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.400
And I just logged in at the beginning of January.

14:34.400 --> 14:40.400
I ran update and there was something like 2,000 packages or something crazy that had to be updated.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.500
And it was fine.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.000
It was just fine.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.700
So, give it a go.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.200
Okay, thank you for that.

14:46.200 --> 14:51.100
The last time I checked, it was at about 500 to 600 packages needing.

14:51.100 --> 14:57.000
And I just ran Pac-Man now and it's not looking good.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.600
What if I could tell you there was a way to have fresh software

15:00.600 --> 15:05.100
and not worry about breaking changes until major version releases occurred?

15:05.100 --> 15:06.100
What if?

15:06.100 --> 15:08.700
Well, it would be all ears in many ways.

15:08.700 --> 15:14.600
But that's such an anti-pattern argument because major releases, by their very nature,

15:14.600 --> 15:17.400
require you to have a risky upgrade.

15:17.400 --> 15:27.700
Whereas I'm having the very small risk over the lifespan of a system of two, three, four years, whatever.

15:27.700 --> 15:31.100
The cumulative risk is the same, I believe.

15:31.100 --> 15:37.500
But I'm taking that risk 0.01% every day instead of 100% every nine months.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.200
Definitely possible.

15:39.200 --> 15:44.900
It is also possible you're playing Russian roulette with a gun that just happens to have 22 bullets instead of 14.

15:44.900 --> 15:47.500
You're eating every now and then.

15:47.500 --> 15:51.700
There's a possibility that there's a change in there that's going to be really disruptive.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.200
You've been away from Arch for a while.

15:54.200 --> 15:58.000
I think you have some PTSD from your Arch days from breaking things.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.300
No, I ran Arch for years.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.600
I think it's actually really great.

16:00.600 --> 16:05.800
I also really appreciate the idea of, say, you're going to make a breaking change,

16:05.800 --> 16:09.900
hold that, and then make it really clear at a certain release cycle.

16:09.900 --> 16:15.300
Although the Arch system does definitely try to communicate changes.

16:15.300 --> 16:17.400
Here's a great example.

16:17.400 --> 16:20.700
You know the Linux VFIO stuff that we talked about in LUP?

16:20.700 --> 16:22.500
Was it 3.1.4, maybe?

16:22.500 --> 16:25.400
A while ago, anyway.

16:25.400 --> 16:30.400
Linux kernel 5.3 came out and had some breaking changes in it for VFIO.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.100
Do you know how long it took me to roll back?

16:32.100 --> 16:33.900
I mean, maybe kernel's not the best example.

16:33.900 --> 16:39.800
But rolling back a package, because I know it's only a couple of packages that have changed every day,

16:39.800 --> 16:48.000
takes five minutes, if that, as opposed to spending an entire weekend debugging why my major upgrade didn't work.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.400
I mean, maybe I have PTSD from that in the past, same as you have Arch PTSD, you know?

16:53.400 --> 16:54.300
Right. I mean, both ways.

16:54.300 --> 16:58.100
It does mostly just work, as we've seen in the recent 31 upgrades.

16:58.100 --> 17:01.500
I will say it's actually an important discussion.

17:01.500 --> 17:11.000
Like, I have approached Arch knowing that problems may occur if you are updating as frequently as, say, Alex is.

17:11.000 --> 17:16.200
But one of the reasons I do or have done updates, ignoring this last little piece,

17:16.200 --> 17:21.000
have done updates on a weekly basis at least, and only when I'm not, you know,

17:21.000 --> 17:29.100
obviously in need of production, is so that those sort of problems get flushed out by some people who are more risk tolerant,

17:29.100 --> 17:33.000
such as Alex, or have the tools to easily deal with problems.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.500
And so I found that to be a really nice cadence for me.

17:36.500 --> 17:43.300
I will run into things, you know, maybe once or twice a year that I really have to put some time towards.

17:43.300 --> 17:46.700
But other than that, it's been really smooth. I've been really impressed.

17:46.700 --> 17:51.200
I got to say, I used to use Arch myself, and I worked with a lot of people that got into it.

17:51.200 --> 17:55.300
It got real popular right around that time. I know Chris was talking about it a lot on the shows.

17:55.300 --> 18:01.400
And the thing is, if you can religiously update every single day, it's a lot smoother experience.

18:01.400 --> 18:06.400
Not everyone has that discipline. A lot of people, if they go a week, a month without updating,

18:06.400 --> 18:11.400
they'll end up running into problems. And I've had to help a lot of people fix broken Arch installs

18:11.400 --> 18:15.500
just because they went, you know, five weeks without updating and then things didn't work.

18:15.500 --> 18:22.700
And the Arch upstream, they don't test any scenarios like that other than you better be up to date all the way with every package all the time.

18:22.700 --> 18:28.000
And because the Pac-Man package manager is somewhat stupid compared to a lot of other ones.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.600
Oh, it's very dumb. But it's so fast.

18:31.600 --> 18:36.200
Well, it's fast because it doesn't do a lot, right?

18:36.200 --> 18:42.900
Yeah, so because it doesn't do a lot. One of the major things I've seen trip up people who are Arch users

18:42.900 --> 18:48.200
is that the package they have put it that you do an update and you break your system because well,

18:48.200 --> 18:53.800
you didn't go to the Arch website and go check. Oh, wait, you need to do a manual transition yourself

18:53.800 --> 18:58.800
before you can run the package manager because otherwise you will just break your computer irreparably, right?

18:58.800 --> 19:03.400
Those kinds of transitions are painful and they're really difficult to do,

19:03.400 --> 19:06.000
especially when your package manager cannot help you.

19:06.000 --> 19:12.000
Yeah, isn't there one actually pending right now? I can't remember. We're tracking it, but we're not tracking it super closely.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
There's about like if you use like an old version of compression,

19:15.000 --> 19:22.500
which was people were warned about a year ago, but if you still happen to be using it on Arch, you're about to get broken.

19:22.500 --> 19:31.100
Yeah. So if you haven't upgraded Pac-Man in a while, you're kind of screwed because they just switch compression from XC to Z standard.

19:31.100 --> 19:34.600
And so you're broken. That's what it was. Oh, no.

19:34.600 --> 19:38.700
They do say you've had a year. So we expect you already did update.

19:38.700 --> 19:44.300
This is one of those rare instances where they they've actually done a good job of like preparing you for the worst.

19:44.300 --> 19:49.500
But, you know, like take, for example, when the C++ ABI change happened,

19:49.500 --> 20:02.200
lots and lots of people wound up like actually getting really hurt by that because the mixture of ABI has caused things to not link properly at runtime and then things just blew up.

20:02.200 --> 20:09.100
And so, like, there's all kinds of unexpected side effects that come from things like, oh, you're running programs,

20:09.100 --> 20:13.800
but it's after your loop standard C++ was updated, but before everything else that linked to it was updated.

20:13.800 --> 20:17.600
And because there is no order dependency resolution at that level,

20:17.600 --> 20:22.600
you can't make sure that everything that leads up to that package is actually installed first.

20:22.600 --> 20:28.600
So pretty much every kind of package manager is going to check that type of linkage other than Pac-Man.

20:28.600 --> 20:32.900
There it is. I will give a quick update on my Pac-Man situation here.

20:32.900 --> 20:36.300
Am I OK? All right. Real time here. I like it.

20:36.300 --> 20:49.300
So this is error, failed to prepare transaction, could not satisfy dependencies, and the next line you'll love, installing Pac-Man to 5.2.1-1 breaks dependency Pac-Man rather than 5.2.

20:49.300 --> 20:53.500
Yeah, that's not good. So you don't think I'm in a bad situation.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.200
I'll be best to just uninstall Pac-Man completely and start again.

20:56.200 --> 20:58.500
Oh, OK. That's the best advice.

20:58.500 --> 21:03.100
You wanted new Pac-Man, so I broke your Pac-Man to make your Pac-Man so you could have your Pac-Man.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.600
Pac-Man installed DNF.

21:04.600 --> 21:08.100
All of a sudden, I feel it's important that I play the Arch-Defendant for some reason.

21:08.100 --> 21:12.900
Ed mentioned that I'm sure if you search that error message on the forum, you'll probably find a resolution pretty quick.

21:12.900 --> 21:15.000
Do you want to try that next? Try that.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.300
All right. I'll update you guys on that.

21:17.300 --> 21:22.900
All right. So, Byte, I want to give you a chance to tell us what your favorite distro is and what it is about it that you just love so much.

21:22.900 --> 21:32.200
Well, so as many of you know, I'm a Debian Ubuntu guy, and on my laptop, my daily driver is a Budgie Ubuntu.

21:32.200 --> 21:37.100
I got a bit hooked on Budgie when I tried Solace.

21:37.100 --> 21:41.300
And then you eventually wound back on an Ubuntu base, but with the same desktop environment?

21:41.300 --> 21:43.300
Oh, yeah.

21:43.300 --> 21:48.400
Now, I have to ask you, if you could change one thing to make it perfect, what would it be?

21:48.400 --> 21:54.100
Well, I did notice a bug and I'm trying to describe the bug, but no one can replicate it.

21:54.100 --> 21:56.800
So that's an interesting thing.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.000
Yeah. Yeah, I follow you.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.300
Yeah, I feel that way with my glitchy mouse up on my desktop.

22:02.300 --> 22:04.800
Meanwhile, I hear from everybody, it's great on my machine.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.400
That's what I keep hearing. Meanwhile, it's getting worse than ever.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.300
Like, I open up tabs just in the background.

22:09.300 --> 22:13.400
Like, say you're reading something, you like, you know, you middle clicked, like open something in the background.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.000
Yeah.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.900
My mouse just bit, bit, bit, bit, bit.

22:16.900 --> 22:17.800
That's how it moves across the screen.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.200
I can't believe you haven't changed something.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.300
Why are you just sitting here?

22:20.300 --> 22:22.200
What am I going to do? Go to Mac OS?

22:22.200 --> 22:23.000
What am I going to do?

22:23.000 --> 22:25.600
I mean, there's a lot of other apps. Have you tried Arch?

22:25.600 --> 22:28.200
Well, no, I think I have to, I think I'd have to go to Plasma.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.600
Go to Plasma. Come on. You won't regret it.

22:30.600 --> 22:35.500
I know the thing that really needs to be fixed, the toolbars.

22:35.500 --> 22:41.800
You can shove them to the right or the left, but they're still the full size if you hit your mouse on the bottom.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.700
Ah, okay. All right. Good one.

22:43.700 --> 22:47.800
You know what? You ought to, you know, you know, maybe always submit that there as a bug report.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.600
Okay, Carl, I've got a pretty good idea.

22:50.600 --> 22:55.800
Your default setup is Linux Mint from two years ago and you love it.

22:55.800 --> 22:56.500
Am I right?

22:56.500 --> 22:58.700
Absolutely.

22:58.700 --> 23:00.200
Okay. Tell me about your current setup.

23:00.200 --> 23:03.400
What it is you love about it and if you could change one thing to make it perfect.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.000
Sure. Well, I know your little joke there.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.700
You know that I run Fedora.

23:07.700 --> 23:09.700
I know you love it too for your servers.

23:09.700 --> 23:11.700
I'm using it pretty much everywhere.

23:11.700 --> 23:14.200
Servers, desktop, laptop, everything.

23:14.200 --> 23:18.200
The very first thing that really attracted me about Linux was package management in general.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.200
Started getting into it more.

23:20.200 --> 23:24.400
Was able to get a job doing a lot of work with that with the IUS project there at Rackspace

23:24.400 --> 23:28.200
and just got real deep into the RPM ecosystem.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.800
At that time, I was still running Arch on my desktop

23:30.800 --> 23:34.300
and I was doing a good bit of Arch packages in the AUR just for,

23:34.300 --> 23:36.600
you know, scratching my own itches, things that I wanted to use

23:36.600 --> 23:40.100
and rather than just doing a one-off install, I was like, no, of course,

23:40.100 --> 23:44.200
it needs to be a package and I'll just make it myself and upload it to the AUR.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.500
Learned enough about the, around Pacman and their package format

23:47.500 --> 23:50.500
to realize just how much better RPM was in it.

23:50.500 --> 23:52.400
I mean, it's new and it's fast,

23:52.400 --> 23:57.300
but there are just so many edge cases, things like the linkage stuff we got into earlier

23:57.300 --> 24:00.600
that, you know, all of that, all those years of robustness

24:00.600 --> 24:03.900
and maturity just really comes in handy for a lot of things

24:03.900 --> 24:08.300
and especially at Rackspace, you see those kinds of things all the time

24:08.300 --> 24:12.000
where customers add random repos or do different kinds of updates, break things

24:12.000 --> 24:16.900
and just having a robust package manager is absolutely essential.

24:16.900 --> 24:19.700
That's one of the things that I really like about it

24:19.700 --> 24:23.500
and the way that Fedora is changing now, the thing that's really great

24:23.500 --> 24:27.000
besides just being a total RPM nerd around this stuff and liking it a lot,

24:27.000 --> 24:32.800
they have a real low barrier to entry to getting updates, changes and updates to their packages.

24:32.800 --> 24:36.400
They've got it set up now where once you get your Fedora account,

24:36.400 --> 24:39.300
you can actually send pull requests to update RPM spec files,

24:39.300 --> 24:43.800
which unlike Debian packaging stuff is actually one file understandable

24:43.800 --> 24:47.400
that you can just look at and see what it's doing in a snap.

24:47.400 --> 24:52.200
It's not quite as simple as, you know, a bash script like Pacman stuff is,

24:52.200 --> 24:55.000
but there's other problems there with that simplicity.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.600
I think RPM spec files strike a really good balance

24:57.600 --> 25:01.900
between simplicity and capability and flexibility and robustness.

25:01.900 --> 25:04.900
So being able to send pull requests just to change things,

25:04.900 --> 25:09.300
a good example, I think it was a week or two ago with the Fedora 31 show,

25:09.300 --> 25:13.800
she's noticed that the Ferronix test suite was a major version behind.

25:13.800 --> 25:19.700
During that show, I forked the repo, sent a pull request to update it to the latest version, to version 9.

25:19.700 --> 25:22.100
That just got accepted and built today.

25:22.100 --> 25:27.200
So pull requests are the way to do open source, you know, stuff now

25:27.200 --> 25:32.000
and with Fedora getting that natively integrated with the low barrier to entry, it's awesome.

25:32.000 --> 25:32.800
That's great.

25:32.800 --> 25:33.400
That really is great.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.500
I can't argue with any of that.

25:34.500 --> 25:37.500
Makes a lot of sense and I echo a lot of that as well.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.200
So, Neil, what about you?

25:39.200 --> 25:43.400
What's your distro of choice and what's your favorite thing about it?

25:43.400 --> 25:45.600
Oh, Carl, you actually, hold on, Neil, before we go to you, Carl,

25:45.600 --> 25:49.500
you didn't say if you could change one thing about Fedora, what it would be to make it perfect.

25:49.500 --> 25:52.800
The thing that bugs me and I've gotten away from this myself,

25:52.800 --> 25:57.000
being a problem for myself just by switching everything to Intel and AMD,

25:57.000 --> 26:02.100
but NVIDIA drivers, it comes up time and time again for new users

26:02.100 --> 26:06.500
and it's just a bad experience having to add other repos to get it working

26:06.500 --> 26:10.700
and I know that there's all kinds of licensing and firmware problems around it.

26:10.700 --> 26:14.000
A lot of it honestly is well over my head,

26:14.000 --> 26:17.800
but what I do know is that Fedora has exceptions for firmware,

26:17.800 --> 26:21.900
for proprietary blob firmware in their kernel to get things working.

26:21.900 --> 26:27.200
I know that Red Hat puts a lot of proprietary software and kernel binary blobs in their kernel

26:27.200 --> 26:31.900
to get enterprise hardware, especially storage solutions working

26:31.900 --> 26:36.800
and I just think Red Hat should be able to put their weight behind getting this problem fixed,

26:36.800 --> 26:40.600
whether it's a partnership, some kind of exception, some kind of licensing deal.

26:40.600 --> 26:46.600
I mean, Red Hat and Canonical, I know they did something with Microsoft to get UEFI working

26:46.600 --> 26:51.400
and I just feel like that there's some kind of solution there if everyone put their weight behind it

26:51.400 --> 26:55.200
to get NVIDIA drivers working correctly out of the box on Fedora.

26:55.200 --> 26:59.300
Ah, from your lips to their ears, Carl, from your lips.

26:59.300 --> 27:03.100
Neil, what about you? So your favorite distro and of course what you love about it

27:03.100 --> 27:07.900
and the thing you'd love to just sort of tweak, change, make different to make it perfect.

27:07.900 --> 27:11.800
So I've got two favorites, but I'm going to talk about the latter one

27:11.800 --> 27:13.400
since Carl did a great job with the former.

27:13.400 --> 27:17.000
So I run Fedora and OpenSUSE pretty much all over the place.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.100
I've got a little bit of Agios sprinkled right here and there,

27:19.100 --> 27:22.400
but the two major ones I run are Fedora and OpenSUSE.

27:22.400 --> 27:27.600
What I really like about OpenSUSE is,

27:27.600 --> 27:33.200
honestly, I like that I have a rolling release distribution that actually gets tested and integrated

27:33.200 --> 27:41.000
and I get a good feeling whenever I'm using Tumbleweed versus the brief time I've used Arch

27:41.000 --> 27:46.600
or the time where I ruined myself doing Gen 2, stuff like that.

27:46.600 --> 27:53.700
Having a little bit of a peace of mind when you're doing a rolling distribution really goes a long way.

27:53.700 --> 27:58.500
And the KDE experience, because I've been a KDE guy for several years now,

27:58.500 --> 28:03.700
the KDE experience in OpenSUSE is mostly amazing.

28:03.700 --> 28:05.200
It works really well.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.200
They've got a good visual experience.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.800
They've got a design language around it.

28:09.800 --> 28:12.300
They've got good backgrounds and all that stuff.

28:12.300 --> 28:17.000
It feels like it's a loved part of the distribution.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
And not to say that Fedora doesn't have a great KDE experience.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.700
It's just that in OpenSUSE, they've tweaked it.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.300
They've made it their own.

28:24.300 --> 28:26.500
Right, feels more a part of it and loved.

28:26.500 --> 28:34.100
Right. As far as what I really wish I could change, I don't like the Package Manager.

28:34.100 --> 28:35.300
I don't.

28:35.300 --> 28:40.100
Zipper has bitten me enough times now and done enough weird things that I actually,

28:40.100 --> 28:42.900
on my personal OpenSUSE systems, have switched to DNF.

28:42.900 --> 28:44.400
So I use that everywhere.

28:44.400 --> 28:46.500
I even patched PackageKit to switch to it.

28:46.500 --> 28:52.800
I just cannot see them having the will to go through yet another Package Manager transition.

28:52.800 --> 28:55.600
They haven't done one in 10 years, so why the hell not?

28:55.600 --> 28:58.200
You've got to be kidding me. It feels like it's been two months ago.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.600
You're telling me we've been using Zipper for 10 years?

29:00.600 --> 29:02.600
Zipper was introduced in 2006.

29:02.600 --> 29:05.400
Oh, I remember when Zipper was around, but I don't...

29:05.400 --> 29:08.200
I mean, no way has it been the default Package Manager.

29:08.200 --> 29:08.800
Yep.

29:08.800 --> 29:10.100
Really?

29:10.100 --> 29:12.700
I feel like that's sort of when they started to lose me, to tell you the truth,

29:12.700 --> 29:15.600
is when they went through a series of Package Manager changes.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.600
I just couldn't really be bothered.

29:17.600 --> 29:20.600
Remember how I called you out for being old, Chris?

29:20.600 --> 29:22.500
Full circle.

29:22.500 --> 29:23.100
I hate you.

29:23.100 --> 29:25.800
It took longer in SLE than it did in OpenSUSE.

29:25.800 --> 29:27.300
Huh. Okay.

29:27.300 --> 29:31.700
All right. I remember Zipper as a tool to manage software across multiple Linux systems.

29:31.700 --> 29:34.100
I don't, you know, that's how I remember Zipper.

29:34.100 --> 29:37.100
I want to hear from Frank SMB over there on his favorite distro,

29:37.100 --> 29:39.700
what he loves about it, and the one thing you would change, Frank.

29:39.700 --> 29:45.500
So I use Ubuntu MATE, and to be completely transparent,

29:45.500 --> 29:48.400
I do a little bit with Wimpy and the team.

29:48.400 --> 29:49.100
Fair enough.

29:49.100 --> 29:50.400
Why I chose it.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.900
So I've used Linux for a while.

29:53.900 --> 29:57.600
I took a break, came back to it on the desktop,

29:57.600 --> 30:03.700
and I was using Ubuntu because I've used XFCE for a long time.

30:03.700 --> 30:07.600
And I got a little tired of a few issues with sleep,

30:07.600 --> 30:11.800
and I'm not trying to throw XFCE under the bus at all.

30:11.800 --> 30:13.800
And I started looking at MATE,

30:13.800 --> 30:19.000
and when I looked at it, I did not like the advanced MATE menu.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.800
For me, a menu is a big deal.

30:21.800 --> 30:26.300
And as soon as they brought the brisk menu in, I got really interested.

30:26.300 --> 30:27.200
Sure.

30:27.200 --> 30:31.700
Started using it and really kind of figured out this is where I wanted to be.

30:31.700 --> 30:36.200
The balance of performance to like battery power is really great.

30:36.200 --> 30:40.100
And there's, especially with what they've done in 1910,

30:40.100 --> 30:44.500
a lot of the key binding, so you can either do it really mouse driven

30:44.500 --> 30:47.500
or keyboard driven, which is really awesome.

30:47.500 --> 30:51.700
And the amount of work that Luke and Wimpy have put into the welcome

30:51.700 --> 30:54.200
and the software boutique is just wonderful.

30:54.200 --> 30:59.000
So I think it's really something that's great for ease of use for a new user

30:59.000 --> 31:02.200
and for someone that is really experienced.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.500
Completely agree.

31:03.500 --> 31:04.000
Yeah.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.200
And if you could change one thing about it to make it perfect?

31:07.200 --> 31:08.500
So there's two things.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.400
One is a little bit outside of the scope,

31:10.400 --> 31:15.000
and that's to have more of a scalable, high DPI setting.

31:15.000 --> 31:19.300
And maybe Wayland will get that for us.

31:19.300 --> 31:23.300
My biggest one is to do some work on the panel.

31:23.300 --> 31:27.800
So right now, it's kind of a little bit more difficult

31:27.800 --> 31:32.700
than it should be to make the panel look exactly like you want it.

31:32.700 --> 31:37.500
So you have to go in and make some changes that are not exactly for a new user,

31:37.500 --> 31:39.200
the best experience.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.600
But doing that opens up another can of worms.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.600
But that's really my only thing that I would really want to have changed.

31:45.600 --> 31:46.900
Yeah, fair enough.

31:46.900 --> 31:47.300
I love it.

31:47.300 --> 31:48.900
You're making me want to try it out again.

31:48.900 --> 31:49.400
Yeah, right?

31:49.400 --> 31:50.700
It's such a great environment.

31:50.700 --> 31:51.200
All right.

31:51.200 --> 31:54.000
Mr. Minimac, I'm curious to hear what your favorite distro is,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.400
what you love about it, what you'd change.

31:56.400 --> 32:00.800
I think I can say I'm a first Ubuntu user.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.600
So when I started, it was the late 90s.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.000
I started with C64.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.500
I even bought a distribution.

32:07.500 --> 32:10.000
I had a 300-page book that came with it.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.300
Then I switched to Mandrake, and I really love it.

32:12.300 --> 32:15.500
And then I felt ready for Debian.

32:15.500 --> 32:19.900
And just after a year of Debian, I felt really at home.

32:19.900 --> 32:23.800
Ubuntu started with their releases, and then I switched to Ubuntu.

32:23.800 --> 32:27.000
Mainly the graphical stuff was much nicer,

32:27.000 --> 32:30.200
and configuration was a little bit easier than Debian.

32:30.200 --> 32:34.000
And for most of my machines, I stay in Ubuntu now.

32:34.000 --> 32:34.900
And I love it.

32:34.900 --> 32:35.700
Yeah.

32:35.700 --> 32:38.400
That's how I really got into Ubuntu early on, too,

32:38.400 --> 32:40.300
was I was a pretty happy Debian user,

32:40.300 --> 32:42.900
but wanted just a little bit more.

32:42.900 --> 32:45.100
And yeah, Ubuntu had that.

32:45.100 --> 32:47.500
A little bit special for my main desktop,

32:47.500 --> 32:49.900
I don't use a default Windows environment.

32:49.900 --> 32:53.400
I use Enlightenment for decades now.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.100
So I guess if you could change one thing,

32:55.100 --> 32:57.600
would it be to ship Enlightenment by default?

32:57.600 --> 33:00.900
No, no, no, not really.

33:00.900 --> 33:03.700
I just love the way they handle dual-screen setups

33:03.700 --> 33:05.300
or multiple-screen setups.

33:05.300 --> 33:09.900
But on my laptops now, I use GNOME,

33:09.900 --> 33:11.800
and that is no problem for me.

33:11.800 --> 33:15.900
For me, it's easy to switch between the different interfaces,

33:15.900 --> 33:16.900
so it's no problem.

33:16.900 --> 33:20.300
I do a lot with shortcuts, so it's very easy for me.

33:20.300 --> 33:23.100
What is it that Enlightenment does about the multi-monitor

33:23.100 --> 33:24.400
that you like so much?

33:24.400 --> 33:28.500
Enlightenment treats the screens completely independent.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.900
So I can switch screens on the left

33:30.900 --> 33:32.900
and have the same screen on the right,

33:32.900 --> 33:35.500
so the same desktop and all that stuff.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.500
You can add desktop,

33:37.500 --> 33:41.100
and you have completely independent monitors.

33:41.100 --> 33:42.300
That is really cool.

33:42.300 --> 33:43.900
So you know, GNOME Shell does that now,

33:43.900 --> 33:45.600
where you can have, so in my case,

33:45.600 --> 33:50.500
I have a center horizontal 27-inch monitor,

33:50.500 --> 33:53.700
and then I have two 27-inch vertical screens.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.000
Those remain static.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.700
So whatever I have on the 27-inch vertical screens

33:57.700 --> 33:58.800
remains static,

33:58.800 --> 34:02.200
but then I can switch virtual desktops in the center screen.

34:02.200 --> 34:03.500
And I like that quite a bit.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.100
Okay, okay. Well, that was a try then.

34:06.100 --> 34:08.200
So at the time, I started using Enlightenment.

34:08.200 --> 34:11.300
Enlightenment was the only one, I think,

34:11.300 --> 34:14.600
rather developed some environment that did that.

34:14.600 --> 34:15.800
I could give it a try,

34:15.800 --> 34:18.200
but I really fell in love with Enlightenment.

34:18.200 --> 34:20.600
I'm also a minimalist user

34:20.600 --> 34:23.100
when it comes to my graphical layout.

34:23.100 --> 34:25.600
So I have a hidden panel,

34:25.600 --> 34:27.700
and I have a hidden Enlightenment shelf,

34:27.700 --> 34:30.700
and the rest of the screen is blank with the background.

34:30.700 --> 34:32.600
Oh, that's nice and clean.

34:32.600 --> 34:35.300
And if you could just tweak something or change something

34:35.300 --> 34:38.000
or even wave a magic wand and make it perfect,

34:38.000 --> 34:38.800
what would it be?

34:38.800 --> 34:42.300
It's in fact an experiment I'd like to start.

34:42.300 --> 34:45.900
It's having a Debian-based rolling distro,

34:45.900 --> 34:47.900
like using Debian SIDs,

34:47.900 --> 34:51.700
and then just try to use it as a rolling distro.

34:51.700 --> 34:52.900
That would be cool.

34:52.900 --> 34:55.600
The thing is, I guess they would need to give

34:55.600 --> 34:58.700
a little bit more love to the packages

34:58.700 --> 35:01.800
when they first put it into their SID repos,

35:01.800 --> 35:03.700
because when I used Debian,

35:03.700 --> 35:05.900
but, well, it was decades ago,

35:05.900 --> 35:09.600
when you used SID, you often had some package breakage.

35:09.600 --> 35:10.200
Yeah.

35:10.200 --> 35:12.100
Now I guess we could give it a try,

35:12.100 --> 35:13.200
and now it could work,

35:13.200 --> 35:16.100
because then you have a rolling distro.

35:16.100 --> 35:17.400
All right, that's a good one.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.600
I like that.

35:18.600 --> 35:21.900
All right, so let's now go to Mr. Tweets over there.

35:21.900 --> 35:24.400
So Mr. Tweets, what's your favorite distro?

35:24.400 --> 35:25.400
What do you love about it,

35:25.400 --> 35:27.600
and what would you change to make it perfect?

35:27.600 --> 35:29.500
So on the desktop, for the last little while,

35:29.500 --> 35:31.400
I've been using KDE Neon.

35:31.400 --> 35:33.800
You know, it's kind of a nice rolling Plasma user land,

35:33.800 --> 35:36.600
and it gets out of my way, and it's customizable,

35:36.600 --> 35:38.400
and I can just do what I need to do.

35:38.400 --> 35:42.000
It kind of forces me into knowing a little bit about,

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
you know, the way to set my machine up,

35:44.000 --> 35:45.300
and I can kind of grow into it.

35:45.300 --> 35:47.900
And the KDE Pim suite, I really like as well.

35:47.900 --> 35:48.700
Really, really good.

35:48.700 --> 35:50.300
Yeah, boy, if that works for you,

35:50.300 --> 35:51.400
that's such a win.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.200
It is well-developed.

35:52.200 --> 35:53.000
Yeah.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.600
I love Neon as a workstation,

35:54.600 --> 35:57.000
because I really have not had a single issue.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.500
This machine that I'm sitting at to read the show notes

35:59.500 --> 36:02.500
is on Neon, and it's sort of perfect,

36:02.500 --> 36:05.700
because the base of the OS just is a good old

36:05.700 --> 36:08.500
what you get is what you expect Ubuntu LTS,

36:08.500 --> 36:12.000
and then it's fresh desktop environment all the time.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.500
But I really haven't had a break yet,

36:13.500 --> 36:17.700
and I attribute that besides hard work,

36:17.700 --> 36:20.400
and bug testing, and all those things.

36:20.400 --> 36:25.100
I attribute it to the fact that most the developers

36:25.100 --> 36:28.000
that are creating Plasma are using this themselves.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.900
So if they break it, it breaks their desktop.

36:29.900 --> 36:30.700
Right, they got to fix it.

36:30.700 --> 36:31.600
Silly Freak Quick.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.100
Yeah.

36:33.100 --> 36:34.200
How often do you update?

36:34.200 --> 36:35.700
That's one question I have.

36:35.700 --> 36:36.500
Yeah.

36:36.500 --> 36:37.700
It depends on what the machine is.

36:37.700 --> 36:40.900
So on my laptop, like every couple of days,

36:40.900 --> 36:42.800
I'll say, on my workstation at home,

36:42.800 --> 36:43.800
maybe once a week,

36:43.800 --> 36:46.300
just because I need it to be a bit more stable.

36:46.300 --> 36:47.300
Yeah.

36:47.300 --> 36:48.900
I like updating.

36:48.900 --> 36:49.500
I enjoy it.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.700
You've got that look in your eye.

36:50.700 --> 36:53.600
I just like seeing like how many packages are changing,

36:53.600 --> 36:58.100
and often it's like a pretty insignificant amount

36:58.100 --> 36:59.200
of disk space that's changing.

36:59.200 --> 37:00.800
Or sometimes it goes down, and you're like, oh.

37:00.800 --> 37:01.400
Yeah.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.100
It's just the coolest thing.

37:03.100 --> 37:03.400
I don't know.

37:03.400 --> 37:04.500
So I really enjoy updating.

37:04.500 --> 37:07.400
But I also enjoy a computer that works.

37:07.400 --> 37:08.700
But I'll save mine.

37:08.700 --> 37:09.900
So Mr. Payne, what about you?

37:09.900 --> 37:12.800
Well, don't we need, well, Mr. Tweets here will change?

37:12.800 --> 37:13.400
Oh, right.

37:13.400 --> 37:13.700
Yeah.

37:13.700 --> 37:16.000
So what would you tweak, Tweets, to make it perfect?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
The one thing I'd like to see from the Neon project,

37:18.000 --> 37:22.100
and it kind of goes for what I use on servers mainly as well,

37:22.100 --> 37:25.600
is a base that I can use that's on the Ubuntu interim releases,

37:25.600 --> 37:27.700
just because of hardware enablement that

37:27.700 --> 37:29.300
gets there a little bit quicker than it

37:29.300 --> 37:31.700
does to the long-term support releases.

37:31.700 --> 37:33.500
That would be really great if they could just

37:33.500 --> 37:36.200
make an ISO that was based on 1910, for example.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.400
I kind of agree.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.400
When it comes to a workstation that's

37:39.400 --> 37:44.200
doing a reoccurring task, maybe not.

37:44.200 --> 37:45.900
But when it comes to my system that I use

37:45.900 --> 37:48.400
as both a workstation and a machine

37:48.400 --> 37:50.200
to have a little bit of fun, it is really

37:50.200 --> 37:53.000
really nice to have maybe like the new ZFS stuff

37:53.000 --> 37:55.200
or have a little bit newer kernel stack.

37:55.200 --> 37:55.700
Yeah.

37:55.700 --> 37:56.200
Yeah.

37:56.200 --> 37:56.600
Yeah.

37:56.600 --> 37:57.400
Great one.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.100
All right, Mr. Payne, what about you?

37:59.100 --> 38:00.600
You know, I've been thinking about this.

38:00.600 --> 38:01.400
It's a tough question.

38:01.400 --> 38:01.900
It is.

38:01.900 --> 38:03.400
It's hard to declare favorites.

38:03.400 --> 38:04.700
Oh, yeah, definitely.

38:04.700 --> 38:07.600
I can excuse you from that since we hop so much, if you'd like.

38:07.600 --> 38:08.800
Yes, thank you.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.800
It's especially funny to say this because I'm not,

38:10.800 --> 38:13.500
I don't have this distribution installed anywhere

38:13.500 --> 38:14.900
on this laptop at the moment.

38:14.900 --> 38:18.500
And I'm, in fact, using KDE neon for the show.

38:18.500 --> 38:20.100
It just keeps working.

38:20.100 --> 38:21.900
But I got to say Arch, I think.

38:21.900 --> 38:25.000
It's just the, you know, it's the simplicity

38:25.000 --> 38:25.900
that I come back to.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.300
And despite what many people think,

38:27.300 --> 38:29.400
it's not, you know, it's not necessarily easy.

38:29.400 --> 38:32.000
But it just, it's aesthetically pleasing

38:32.000 --> 38:36.500
because it's so simple and then combined in a clean fashion.

38:36.500 --> 38:41.000
And I feel very much in control and linked with my system

38:41.000 --> 38:43.300
and feel like I actually can understand everything.

38:43.300 --> 38:45.500
Or, well, I don't pretend to understand everything.

38:45.500 --> 38:48.100
But I can understand as much as is possible about how

38:48.100 --> 38:50.000
my system works and is set up.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.400
And because of that, when you have the time to engage,

38:52.400 --> 38:55.100
I find it to be very robust.

38:55.100 --> 38:58.200
So if you had to set up a system this weekend

38:58.200 --> 39:01.300
to, like, be a home server, Arch is the way you'd go?

39:01.300 --> 39:02.000
Well, it depends.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.700
I mean, it perhaps, depending on how you use it,

39:04.700 --> 39:06.600
may work less well in a case of a machine

39:06.600 --> 39:08.400
that you don't want to interact with very well.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.300
So for this case, I was really thinking mostly

39:10.300 --> 39:11.500
of the workstation.

39:11.500 --> 39:14.000
But the server, these days, I've been using probably

39:14.000 --> 39:14.800
an Ubuntu LTS.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.800
You're saying you've never built a router based on Arch?

39:16.800 --> 39:17.000
Oh, no.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.100
I mean, yes, that is absolutely a longstanding appliance

39:21.100 --> 39:22.900
of mine that works very well.

39:22.900 --> 39:25.000
And part of it is because it was very simple, right?

39:25.000 --> 39:27.500
I didn't have a lot of cruft to remove to get it into the way.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.300
I could build it exactly as I needed it.

39:29.300 --> 39:30.800
So there weren't a lot of moving pieces.

39:30.800 --> 39:31.800
Yeah, there's really not.

39:31.800 --> 39:34.100
It's pretty surprising how light you can make it.

39:34.100 --> 39:35.400
I totally get that.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.800
I wonder, with our recent testing of Fedora,

39:37.800 --> 39:40.400
if it hasn't touched on some of those notes for you.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.800
It absolutely has.

39:41.800 --> 39:44.000
Fedora also feels just very modern.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.400
It's well integrated with SystemD.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.400
All the new sorts of bits and pieces

39:47.400 --> 39:49.300
that come available in the Linux ecosystem,

39:49.300 --> 39:52.700
you can find them there, just like you can find them in Arch.

39:52.700 --> 39:55.500
I think I'm still a little less familiar.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.300
I'm growing more familiar with that ecosystem

39:57.300 --> 39:59.800
and some of the newer tooling, as I've checked back

39:59.800 --> 40:02.100
in this time around.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.500
There's more going on.

40:03.500 --> 40:07.500
It doesn't feel quite as individualized,

40:07.500 --> 40:09.800
decomplected, simple, necessarily.

40:09.800 --> 40:13.000
But what's there is very well done and put together.

40:13.000 --> 40:17.500
So I find it very enjoyable to use.

40:17.500 --> 40:20.800
That also has been my experience with it, as well.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.600
I enjoy both Arch and Fedora very much in a similar way.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.900
So if you could just tweak one thing about Arch

40:25.900 --> 40:28.100
to make it perfect, what would it be?

40:28.100 --> 40:29.900
I don't pretend I think this is reasonable

40:29.900 --> 40:32.500
or in any way will happen, but CFS in the kernel.

40:32.500 --> 40:34.600
Just there, ready to go.

40:34.600 --> 40:37.900
Boy, can I get a ding for that.

40:37.900 --> 40:41.200
If I could change, I'll just tell you mine right now.

40:41.200 --> 40:43.300
If I could change one thing about Fedora,

40:43.300 --> 40:45.300
it would be CFS in the kernel.

40:45.300 --> 40:50.200
I love you Fedora, but we have Fedora on our NAS here.

40:50.200 --> 40:53.400
And every time you do a major update of just,

40:53.400 --> 40:55.200
not even like an upgrade to the next release,

40:55.200 --> 41:01.200
just an update inside Fedora 30, it's a real crap shoot.

41:01.200 --> 41:03.900
I mean, we were down for 45 minutes last time, maybe?

41:03.900 --> 41:06.200
Well, we were distracted while troubleshooting.

41:06.200 --> 41:09.200
But every frickin' time there's a big kernel update,

41:09.200 --> 41:10.700
the CFS stuff breaks.

41:10.700 --> 41:13.100
And it's like you got to go through and really be diligent

41:13.100 --> 41:15.800
about the order that things come up in the system

41:15.800 --> 41:17.200
and how things respond to that.

41:17.200 --> 41:20.000
And you really have to make sure that you get your DKMS

41:20.000 --> 41:22.300
modules built and that your system can boot far enough

41:22.300 --> 41:23.800
to get that done before it needs to get

41:23.800 --> 41:25.100
to those other file systems.

41:25.100 --> 41:29.100
And it really is just a frickin' nightmare.

41:29.100 --> 41:29.800
Totally solvable.

41:29.800 --> 41:32.300
You can admin your way around all of those problems.

41:32.300 --> 41:34.100
It's just things you have to do.

41:34.100 --> 41:35.300
Blame DKMS.

41:35.300 --> 41:36.100
You really, yeah.

41:36.100 --> 41:38.800
You really just, if we were using XFS

41:38.800 --> 41:41.700
or we were using Extended 4, it would literally be a non-issue.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.800
But because we want CFS, it's a fight.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.400
Or if we were using Ubuntu.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.600
So I'd really like to run Fedora on my home server.

41:49.600 --> 41:53.200
But because of those, because I refuse to use DKMS,

41:53.200 --> 41:55.600
that's still running CentOS with the Kmod packages

41:55.600 --> 41:57.400
from CFS on Linux.

41:57.400 --> 42:00.000
All right, so I want to get Cheesy a chance to jump in here.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.500
So Cheesy, if you were going to throw a system together

42:02.500 --> 42:05.000
this weekend, what distro would you go with?

42:05.000 --> 42:06.900
And what is it that you love about it?

42:06.900 --> 42:09.800
And what's the thing you'd change to make it perfect?

42:09.800 --> 42:12.000
Well, first up, I'd like to back it up a little bit

42:12.000 --> 42:15.300
and date myself maybe a little more.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.300
So you guys are talking about package managers.

42:17.300 --> 42:20.600
And Debian and Apt was a thing for me, obviously.

42:20.600 --> 42:23.800
And getting into Debian as my third distro

42:23.800 --> 42:26.500
to ever install Apt was a great one.

42:26.500 --> 42:30.400
Because before that, it was tar.gz files.

42:30.400 --> 42:34.100
So it was that human package manager part.

42:34.100 --> 42:37.300
But no, for me, Debian and Debian-based systems

42:37.300 --> 42:39.100
I've always been comfortable with.

42:39.100 --> 42:41.900
The software can be a little old,

42:41.900 --> 42:43.900
but all the derivatives that are available now.

42:43.900 --> 42:49.700
So I ditched Debian straight up for Ubuntu back when,

42:49.700 --> 42:53.900
I think it was 4.10, so Warty Warthog,

42:53.900 --> 42:56.000
and started using it there just because it

42:56.000 --> 42:58.700
was bundled with additional pieces of software

42:58.700 --> 43:03.000
back then when we had CD and DVD burners and stuff.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.300
So it was nice to have that sort of software

43:05.300 --> 43:07.200
right out of the gate.

43:07.200 --> 43:11.400
But it has never really been a visually appealing.

43:11.400 --> 43:15.200
Debian really had never been a visually appealing distribution

43:15.200 --> 43:16.700
and desktop to use.

43:16.700 --> 43:19.900
And I think Ubuntu kind of filled that void.

43:19.900 --> 43:22.200
A little more polish, a little more focus on that?

43:22.200 --> 43:23.100
Absolutely.

43:23.100 --> 43:27.800
And then you push on through Ubuntu into other derivatives

43:27.800 --> 43:28.300
like Pop!

43:28.300 --> 43:29.100
OS.

43:29.100 --> 43:32.000
They've done a wonderful job building a distro

43:32.000 --> 43:36.200
that they're shipping on production hardware.

43:36.200 --> 43:37.400
It's always nice to see that.

43:37.400 --> 43:42.700
And to me, I think they have one of the best setups for gaming

43:42.700 --> 43:44.700
on Linux overall.

43:44.700 --> 43:48.100
So just jumping in with the nightmare

43:48.100 --> 43:50.700
that is NVIDIA drivers and getting stuff to work

43:50.700 --> 43:53.900
and pushing the FPS that you want out of your games.

43:53.900 --> 43:55.200
So I really appreciate Pop!

43:55.200 --> 43:56.800
OS for that.

43:56.800 --> 43:59.300
And they're also just a great group

43:59.300 --> 44:02.500
of people that are doing some fantastic work.

44:02.500 --> 44:05.100
And then sliding over into elementary,

44:05.100 --> 44:08.400
who have really kind of cultivated a really polished

44:08.400 --> 44:11.800
Linux desktop experience, which as a designer,

44:11.800 --> 44:14.800
I just have huge admiration for those guys.

44:14.800 --> 44:18.200
And it truly shows how much pride they take in their work.

44:18.200 --> 44:21.800
And so I keep bouncing back over there.

44:21.800 --> 44:26.300
And of course, I've got to give a shout out to Ubuntu Matei.

44:26.300 --> 44:30.200
Because I really feel like as far as the Ubuntu spins

44:30.200 --> 44:35.100
or derivatives, it really does give you the most customization

44:35.100 --> 44:36.400
out of the box.

44:36.400 --> 44:42.700
So if you want to mix Pantheon with,

44:42.700 --> 44:47.000
or if you want to throw in any sort of desktop configuration,

44:47.000 --> 44:50.500
it's just super easy to do with Matei.

44:50.500 --> 44:53.100
So I really love it for that.

44:53.100 --> 44:55.700
And then Arch has a special place in my heart

44:55.700 --> 44:58.800
because it's bleeding edge software, which

44:58.800 --> 45:01.700
a lot of distributions are a little bit behind the curve

45:01.700 --> 45:02.200
on that.

45:02.200 --> 45:05.000
And I understand why that is.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.500
Also, the Arch Wiki is fantastic.

45:08.500 --> 45:10.900
And if we really didn't have the Arch Wiki,

45:10.900 --> 45:14.500
there would be a huge void in the Linux community.

45:14.500 --> 45:16.900
Because quite often, even if I'm searching

45:16.900 --> 45:21.400
for an Ubuntu derivative answer to some problem that I'm having,

45:21.400 --> 45:26.000
I can go to the Arch Wiki and generally find that answer.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.600
But obviously, it's not always the easiest for a new user

45:28.600 --> 45:29.800
to jump in.

45:29.800 --> 45:32.600
So that's why I would also recommend Manjaro,

45:32.600 --> 45:35.000
because those guys are doing fantastic work.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.100
They've really stepped up to the plate

45:37.100 --> 45:39.700
and given us that polished desktop,

45:39.700 --> 45:41.900
but also given us a ton of choices.

45:41.900 --> 45:45.800
So to me, it's kind of a blend between Pop Elementary

45:45.800 --> 45:51.000
and Matei is Manjaro on the Arch side.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.700
And from what I haven't done any gaming, serious gaming

45:53.700 --> 45:55.500
under Manjaro, but I would expect

45:55.500 --> 46:02.200
that to be just as excellent as, say, Pop OS would.

46:02.200 --> 46:07.240
As far as changes, it's more of an overarching theme for me.

46:07.240 --> 46:10.400
I'd like to see more commercial and or proprietary software

46:10.400 --> 46:12.160
come to Linux.

46:12.160 --> 46:14.840
Again, working in design, I would

46:14.840 --> 46:18.060
love to see more design, commercially available design

46:18.060 --> 46:21.960
software, GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus, Krita, Blender.

46:21.960 --> 46:24.800
They're all super awesome pieces of software,

46:24.800 --> 46:29.160
but they always seem like a step behind the commercial offerings.

46:29.160 --> 46:31.360
And there really isn't a substitution out there right

46:31.360 --> 46:34.280
now for, say, After Effects.

46:34.280 --> 46:38.080
So we've got a way to come there, I think.

46:38.080 --> 46:40.600
And also, going back to gaming on Linux,

46:40.600 --> 46:44.400
it's gotten a lot better in the last few years,

46:44.400 --> 46:46.560
but we're still kind of struggling.

46:46.560 --> 46:50.120
And I think that that will pick up as more,

46:50.120 --> 46:52.840
as Linux gains a little more market share

46:52.840 --> 46:55.440
and we start to have developers that

46:55.440 --> 46:58.380
are more interested in making sure that these games work

46:58.380 --> 47:00.920
under Linux, I think that'll be great,

47:00.920 --> 47:05.440
because it's just so spread out right now.

47:05.440 --> 47:08.120
Yeah, we've got Steam, but then we've got Lutris.

47:08.120 --> 47:10.920
So it's trying to get everything under one umbrella,

47:10.920 --> 47:13.440
I think, would be great.

47:13.440 --> 47:17.280
And then again, just kind of a global theme with all of this

47:17.280 --> 47:21.120
is within the community itself, I

47:21.120 --> 47:23.400
would like to see us just end this distro wars.

47:23.400 --> 47:25.240
I love the conversation that we're having now

47:25.240 --> 47:28.520
where we're not beating each other up about what we use

47:28.520 --> 47:29.360
or why we use it.

47:29.360 --> 47:32.000
We might be beating up different package managers,

47:32.000 --> 47:33.400
but we're not beating ourselves up

47:33.400 --> 47:35.520
over the actual distributions.

47:35.520 --> 47:39.240
So if we could all put our big boy, girl, and pants on

47:39.240 --> 47:42.520
and understand that what's always the best distro for you

47:42.520 --> 47:44.960
is not the best distro for someone else.

47:44.960 --> 47:47.160
So just show a little empathy toward one another

47:47.160 --> 47:51.000
and lend a hand wherever you can and just really try

47:51.000 --> 47:53.880
to help out and help our community grow and thrive.

47:53.880 --> 47:55.800
And let's not cut each other down.

47:55.800 --> 47:56.520
Oh, I got it.

47:56.520 --> 47:57.040
There you have it.

47:57.040 --> 47:57.640
Wise words from Mr. Chase Bacon.

47:57.640 --> 47:59.360
I think we've got to call it right there.

47:59.360 --> 48:00.560
I was going to go into mine, but you all

48:00.560 --> 48:02.640
know what my stuff is by listening to these shows.

48:02.640 --> 48:06.680
So let's do instead a little bit of housekeeping.

48:06.680 --> 48:08.800
I was hoping you were going to do Millionaire.

48:08.800 --> 48:09.680
We could.

48:09.680 --> 48:10.560
Do you want to?

48:10.560 --> 48:11.640
We should.

48:11.640 --> 48:12.560
We totally could.

48:12.560 --> 48:14.160
We need Neil's questions, though.

48:14.160 --> 48:15.760
Neil's going to have to create some questions for us.

48:15.760 --> 48:17.520
Oh, we should totally have Neil play Millionaire

48:17.520 --> 48:18.280
in the post-show.

48:18.280 --> 48:20.360
All right, we'll do just a little bit of it.

48:20.360 --> 48:21.920
All right, so a little bit of housekeeping

48:21.920 --> 48:23.400
before we get out of here.

48:23.400 --> 48:24.960
Check out Brunch with Brent.

48:24.960 --> 48:26.520
It's cooking up a storm these days.

48:26.520 --> 48:27.520
Wimpy was just on there.

48:27.520 --> 48:29.560
We talked about that last week.

48:29.560 --> 48:30.600
Jill joins this week.

48:30.600 --> 48:32.560
She's often in the Mumble Room.

48:32.560 --> 48:35.400
And Brent, rumor has it, good chat.

48:35.400 --> 48:37.440
Yeah, I learned so much about Jill,

48:37.440 --> 48:39.840
and we had an amazing good time, so I

48:39.840 --> 48:41.400
think everybody else will, too.

48:41.400 --> 48:43.880
Extras.show for that.

48:43.880 --> 48:47.560
A new batch of Linux Academy community courses

48:47.560 --> 48:48.760
is out for November.

48:48.760 --> 48:51.480
Link in the show notes for information about that.

48:51.480 --> 48:53.760
And I think it's also worth calling out here.

48:53.760 --> 48:57.240
Closed captions have been added to the Linux Academy mobile app

48:57.240 --> 48:59.440
for some offline videos with closed captions.

48:59.440 --> 49:00.240
Oh, fancy.

49:00.240 --> 49:00.920
I like that.

49:00.920 --> 49:01.800
That's my mind blowing right there.

49:01.800 --> 49:02.640
That's really nice.

49:02.640 --> 49:05.360
And transcripts are on their way to the iOS app,

49:05.360 --> 49:07.880
as well as really everywhere.

49:07.880 --> 49:09.640
The web platform, everywhere else, too.

49:09.640 --> 49:10.480
It's pretty great.

49:10.480 --> 49:13.000
It's such a great feature.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.560
So check that out.

49:14.560 --> 49:19.000
110 hands-on labs added in the last month.

49:19.000 --> 49:19.840
That's incredible.

49:19.840 --> 49:21.480
Think about how much goes into one of those.

49:21.480 --> 49:22.240
I mean, whoo.

49:22.240 --> 49:23.920
Because that's really what makes the difference is actually

49:23.920 --> 49:24.960
getting your hands on it.

49:24.960 --> 49:25.960
Doing it for real.

49:25.960 --> 49:26.800
You can read it.

49:26.800 --> 49:28.080
Messing it up a few times.

49:28.080 --> 49:29.360
Putting it into practice.

49:29.360 --> 49:31.600
And to have it all just curated for you

49:31.600 --> 49:36.800
and ready to go with the click of a button, gosh, 110?

49:36.800 --> 49:38.080
That's nuts.

49:38.080 --> 49:39.440
That's really great.

49:39.440 --> 49:40.320
That is really great.

49:40.320 --> 49:41.200
Check that out.

49:41.200 --> 49:43.960
Also, go check out extras, extras.show.

49:43.960 --> 49:47.960
And that, my friends, just a quick little housekeeping

49:47.960 --> 49:49.000
right there.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.920
I think that's it for us.

49:50.920 --> 49:53.200
We did things a little bit out of order this week,

49:53.200 --> 49:55.320
because it's a special episode.

49:55.320 --> 49:56.400
I enjoyed it, though.

49:56.400 --> 50:00.080
I feel like I learned a little bit about everybody this week.

50:00.080 --> 50:02.040
And I was going to go into what I

50:02.040 --> 50:05.080
love about my distros of choice, which everybody knows

50:05.080 --> 50:08.320
at this point is primarily Fedora and Ubuntu.

50:08.320 --> 50:09.880
But what would you change?

50:09.880 --> 50:11.520
That's really what I want to know.

50:11.520 --> 50:14.640
Obviously, we all know what you run and why you run it.

50:14.640 --> 50:15.720
But what would you change?

50:15.720 --> 50:16.200
All right.

50:16.200 --> 50:16.480
All right.

50:16.480 --> 50:16.920
That's fair.

50:16.920 --> 50:17.880
Yeah, you're right.

50:17.880 --> 50:20.000
I mean, this show documents what I like.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.520
So what would I change?

50:22.520 --> 50:25.040
All right, well, I already gave you mine for Fedora,

50:25.040 --> 50:27.040
which was ZFS.

50:27.040 --> 50:28.880
I think that's just copied me, but whatever.

50:28.880 --> 50:30.960
Oh, really?

50:30.960 --> 50:32.040
Copycat.

50:32.040 --> 50:36.640
Well, the one for Ubuntu is a little more complicated.

50:36.640 --> 50:38.760
I would really love to see.

50:38.760 --> 50:41.000
And I know it's like the worst case scenario,

50:41.000 --> 50:43.680
because Canonical can't really take this on without getting

50:43.680 --> 50:44.720
a whole bunch of pushback.

50:44.720 --> 50:48.440
But I'd really love to see apt modernized.

50:48.440 --> 50:50.720
And in the case of Ubuntu, I would

50:50.720 --> 50:54.280
love to see something that combines

50:54.280 --> 50:58.380
snaps and Debian packages together in one user

50:58.380 --> 51:01.280
experience, but gives me clear indications what's

51:01.280 --> 51:04.040
a snap versus what's a deb package,

51:04.040 --> 51:06.600
and lets me manage and update both of those two

51:06.600 --> 51:10.040
different things from one command line utility.

51:10.040 --> 51:10.920
Sounds nice.

51:10.920 --> 51:12.960
That's really what I'd love to see.

51:12.960 --> 51:14.800
But I also, at the same time, I really

51:14.800 --> 51:17.000
appreciate what a tricky position that

51:17.000 --> 51:19.240
would be for Canonical to come along and be like,

51:19.240 --> 51:20.700
here's a replacement for apt.

51:20.700 --> 51:23.760
Because every keyboard commentator on the internet

51:23.760 --> 51:25.400
would be like, oh, what's the matter?

51:25.400 --> 51:26.400
Apt isn't good enough?

51:26.400 --> 51:27.840
Not invented here, Canonical?

51:27.840 --> 51:29.340
You know, there'd be no winning.

51:29.340 --> 51:29.840
Right.

51:29.840 --> 51:31.840
It's sort of a hard flip side about Ubuntu.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.960
One of things I love about it is how pragmatic it

51:33.960 --> 51:35.720
feels as an operating system.

51:35.720 --> 51:37.400
But at the same time, yeah, going back,

51:37.400 --> 51:39.400
especially every time I'm on Fedora,

51:39.400 --> 51:42.000
using apt again is just not as pleasant.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.120
What's Neon using?

51:43.120 --> 51:44.480
Neon has replaced apt.

51:44.480 --> 51:46.460
Well, not replaced it, but has something

51:46.460 --> 51:48.080
that sits on top of package kit, right?

51:48.080 --> 51:49.320
Pecan or whatever it is?

51:49.320 --> 51:52.040
Yeah, you use package kit to make sure everything updates.

51:52.040 --> 51:53.800
I don't love that.

51:53.800 --> 51:54.760
It's not as great.

51:54.760 --> 51:56.640
I'd love to really see that addressed.

51:56.640 --> 52:00.560
So funny about that, Gustavo Niemeyer

52:00.560 --> 52:03.680
actually moved to Canonical from Mandriva

52:03.680 --> 52:07.080
because they were considering replacing apt for smart.

52:07.080 --> 52:10.720
Because smart supported running on both Debian systems

52:10.720 --> 52:14.240
and RPM systems, he wrote it to replace apt

52:14.240 --> 52:16.400
because he hated working on the apt code base

52:16.400 --> 52:19.000
and the frustrations of working with Debian upstream

52:19.000 --> 52:21.560
and trying to integrate the RPM back end into the upstream

52:21.560 --> 52:24.000
apt project back then.

52:24.000 --> 52:28.480
So the whole point of him being at Canonical initially

52:28.480 --> 52:31.700
was that they were going to replace apt with smart,

52:31.700 --> 52:35.640
and then they didn't do it for, well, you

52:35.640 --> 52:38.120
can guess the reason why they didn't do it.

52:38.120 --> 52:40.720
You kind of mentioned it already.

52:40.720 --> 52:42.560
And there's some irony in it because one

52:42.560 --> 52:45.160
of the things that really took Linux to the next level for me

52:45.160 --> 52:50.040
where I was like, oh, this is way better, was actually apt.

52:50.040 --> 52:52.440
I mean, Red Hat I started with, but when I actually

52:52.440 --> 52:54.560
put a Debian box into production and it

52:54.560 --> 52:58.280
was self-resolving dependencies and apt-get-update

52:58.280 --> 53:01.820
and apt-get-upgrade were so awesome back in the day

53:01.820 --> 53:03.500
when you were using RPM distros that

53:03.500 --> 53:05.540
installed their RPMs from CDs.

53:05.540 --> 53:06.800
It was really a game changer.

53:06.800 --> 53:09.640
And now here I am at the end of 2019,

53:09.640 --> 53:13.040
and I'm the guy that's saying, I think it's time to replace apt.

53:13.040 --> 53:17.160
And of course, obviously, because it's my fantasy wish

53:17.160 --> 53:19.160
list, this is a unicorn package manager,

53:19.160 --> 53:21.400
it would have the speed of Pac-Man

53:21.400 --> 53:26.040
with the endurance and efficiency and safety of DNF,

53:26.040 --> 53:29.640
but with the speed and efficiency of something

53:29.640 --> 53:31.760
like Pac-Man with the AUR.

53:31.760 --> 53:33.760
And the transactional kind of rollbacks

53:33.760 --> 53:35.520
that you could get with ZFS.

53:35.520 --> 53:36.160
Yes.

53:36.160 --> 53:36.800
There we go.

53:36.800 --> 53:37.760
Yes, exactly.

53:37.760 --> 53:38.880
So there you have it.

53:38.880 --> 53:41.280
That's what I would change, but otherwise, gosh darn it,

53:41.280 --> 53:43.800
it's my favorite freaking operating system.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.400
And we just sat here, and I just feel

53:45.400 --> 53:48.240
like I got to learn a little bit about everybody else, too.

53:48.240 --> 53:49.760
We'd love to hear your thoughts, too.

53:49.760 --> 53:51.080
Let us know what you love about your distro

53:51.080 --> 53:52.160
or what you'd change.

53:52.160 --> 53:56.920
linuxunplug.com slash contact, linuxunplug.com slash subscribe.

53:56.920 --> 53:59.840
And don't forget about that new live time we're trying out.

53:59.840 --> 54:03.840
It's now noon JB time, which is Seattle time,

54:03.840 --> 54:06.680
which is Pacific time.

54:06.680 --> 54:08.200
Time is a construct.

54:08.200 --> 54:10.000
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

54:10.000 --> 54:11.560
to get it in your local construct.

54:11.560 --> 54:12.960
Thanks so much for being here.

54:12.960 --> 54:14.880
We'll see you right back here.

54:14.880 --> 54:18.840
Not on Monday, not on Sunday, not on Friday.

54:18.840 --> 54:19.320
Oh, no.

54:19.320 --> 54:19.920
No, no.

54:19.920 --> 54:22.280
But on Tuesday!

54:22.280 --> 54:50.280
And we'll see you right back here.

54:50.280 --> 55:04.000
All right, JBtitles.com, let's go boat.

55:04.000 --> 55:08.360
And in the meantime, Neil, why don't you

55:08.360 --> 55:10.960
step into the Linux millionaire seat?

55:10.960 --> 55:11.680
Oh, yeah.

55:11.680 --> 55:13.680
Are you ready, sir?

55:13.680 --> 55:14.440
I guess.

55:14.440 --> 55:17.640
For fake internet money that's worth absolutely nothing,

55:17.640 --> 55:23.280
Neil, when was Richard Stallman born?

55:23.280 --> 55:25.080
Now hold on, I'll give you a couple choices.

55:25.080 --> 55:26.800
You got a couple choices here.

55:26.800 --> 55:27.920
You ready?

55:27.920 --> 55:38.360
February 20, 1955, April 13, 1960, or March 16, 1953.

55:38.360 --> 55:40.520
March 16, 1953.

55:40.520 --> 55:42.120
Is that your final answer, sir?

55:42.120 --> 55:44.120
Yes.

55:44.120 --> 55:47.400
All right, locking that in.

55:47.400 --> 55:47.900
Sure.

55:52.840 --> 55:54.520
You are correct.

55:54.520 --> 55:55.640
You nailed it, Neil.

55:55.640 --> 55:56.600
You nailed it.

55:56.600 --> 55:57.160
Good job.

55:57.160 --> 55:57.480
All right.

55:57.480 --> 55:58.160
Nicely done.

55:58.160 --> 56:01.320
You're stepping up, then you're going up in the difficulty here.

56:01.320 --> 56:07.840
Now, for $1,000 of fake internet money that doesn't matter,

56:07.840 --> 56:17.880
how do you save and exit a vi session, or a vi session, colon w, colon x,

56:17.880 --> 56:25.000
or colon wq, or shift zz?

56:25.000 --> 56:26.320
Colon x.

56:26.320 --> 56:27.720
Final answer?

56:27.720 --> 56:28.240
Yes.

56:33.080 --> 56:35.600
The answer is don't use vi.

56:35.600 --> 56:37.960
Well done.

56:37.960 --> 56:38.480
All right.

56:38.480 --> 56:40.400
And then, oh, it tells you how to quit.

56:40.400 --> 56:41.920
All right, here we go.

56:41.920 --> 56:43.800
We're going up in difficulty now.

56:43.800 --> 56:46.240
Now, see, we have a whole bunch of questions that

56:46.240 --> 56:48.280
have been submitted by the audience.

56:48.280 --> 56:49.840
We should put the link out again soon.

56:49.840 --> 56:51.280
This is pretty great.

56:51.280 --> 56:55.240
So we're going off of a list that the audience has submitted.

56:55.240 --> 56:59.680
So I do have to mention that the answers are also from the audience.

56:59.680 --> 57:05.120
But, Neil, for $5,000 of fake internet money,

57:05.120 --> 57:11.320
when was version 0.01 of the Linux kernel released?

57:11.320 --> 57:23.720
November 23, 1991, January 5, 1992, September 17, 1991,

57:23.720 --> 57:28.200
or November 17, 1991?

57:28.200 --> 57:30.280
September 17, 1991.

57:30.280 --> 57:31.640
Ooh, you sound pretty confident.

57:31.640 --> 57:33.720
Is that your final answer?

57:33.720 --> 57:35.240
Naturally.

57:39.000 --> 57:42.440
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner right here.

57:42.440 --> 57:44.080
Neil, congratulations, sir.

57:49.120 --> 57:52.040
$5,000 winner of fake internet points.

57:52.040 --> 57:53.200
I think you got everyone right.

57:53.200 --> 57:57.840
So you are now our reigning champion of a game show that we don't,

57:57.840 --> 58:00.480
when nobody else has played.

58:00.480 --> 58:03.200
Well, the funny thing, I like the Vim question,

58:03.200 --> 58:07.200
because there were two correct answers in there.

58:07.200 --> 58:08.160
Yeah, that's true.

58:08.160 --> 58:10.800
I think there were three correct answers.

58:10.800 --> 58:12.360
The only one that was like, shift-z-z.

58:12.360 --> 58:14.360
It was like, OK, now we've got to throw that in.

58:14.360 --> 58:15.680
Yeah, shift-z-z.

58:15.680 --> 58:16.920
You said write and then quit.

58:16.920 --> 58:19.760
So colon W is wrong.

58:19.760 --> 58:20.240
It's true.

58:20.240 --> 58:20.720
That's true.

58:20.720 --> 58:23.080
Colon W is wrong.

58:23.080 --> 58:26.200
I did just drop the link there for the form into the IRC.

58:26.200 --> 58:28.960
So feel free to jump on there and fill it out.

58:28.960 --> 58:30.600
Do it.

58:30.600 --> 58:32.720
We need your brain, Neil.

58:32.720 --> 58:37.040
All right, so I don't, as a small update on my ARCH system here.

58:37.040 --> 58:39.000
I don't have it fixed yet, although there's

58:39.000 --> 58:40.920
lots of information out there.

58:40.920 --> 58:45.840
But I'm only 644 packages behind, so not the worst.

58:45.840 --> 58:49.200
I did a distro sync using DNF of my Tumbleweed machine

58:49.200 --> 58:51.360
while I was talking about Tumbleweed.

58:51.360 --> 58:53.560
And it just finished, and I just rebooted into it.

58:53.560 --> 58:56.320
It's like, oh, yeah, I hadn't updated since July.

58:56.320 --> 58:59.080
And I just pulled into the November one,

58:59.080 --> 59:00.360
and everything came out fine.

59:00.360 --> 59:01.440
Oh, good.

59:01.440 --> 59:02.560
Well, that's nice.

59:02.560 --> 59:04.840
Yeah, that does feel good.
