1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380
Although, maybe before we start, we

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,800
should probably start with a very special happy birthday.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,640
Happy birthday!

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,120
Happy birthday, Brent.

5
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,040
Happy birthday, dude.

6
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,840
Oh, you guys.

7
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,000
Thank you.

8
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,760
Still out there traveling the world in parts.

9
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,960
It's the new normal.

10
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,920
I assume he wouldn't want it any other way.

11
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,020
Well, I'm glad you're here, Brent,

12
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,400
even though it's your birthday, because we went down

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,440
to Intel's Portland campus and learned all about Clear Linux

14
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,440
and got some really good takeaways.

15
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,820
So we'll be talking about that in today's show.

16
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,160
But that's for later.

17
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,360
Just right now, I want to say happy birthday, sir.

18
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,440
I kind of didn't even realize it was coming up,

19
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,960
because I don't even know which day of the week it is anymore.

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,080
Time compression.

21
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,600
It's a real problem.

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,600
I don't know how Elle deals with it, to be honest,

23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,680
because how do you deal with it?

24
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840
Do you not suffer from time compression like I do?

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,960
I think I just never know what time it is.

26
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,560
Yeah, I think there's some of us out there

27
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,960
that when you travel a lot, you're dateless.

28
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,520
The only thing that keeps me pinned is the show recordings.

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,280
Like, if I don't do a show, I don't really

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,680
know what day of the week it is.

31
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,520
That's why when you change which day you do a show,

32
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,200
it really, I mean, your whole week changes.

33
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,400
It really messes with you.

34
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,720
It's a weird phenomenon.

35
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,880
You're running stateless, is what you're saying, right?

36
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
Stateless and dateless.

37
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,000
There it is.

38
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Ouch.

39
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:26,840
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 303 for May 28, 2019.

40
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,160
Well, hello there, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk

41
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,640
show.

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,440
My name is Chris.

43
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,320
My name is Wes.

44
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,680
Hello, Mr. Payne.

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,480
How are you feeling?

46
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
Jet-lagged at all today?

47
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,520
I think finally I'm back to normal.

48
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,560
You actually look good.

49
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,040
Thank you.

50
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,640
You do look good.

51
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,400
I'm ready to do Linux Unplugged again.

52
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,000
It was a pain to be away last week,

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,240
but you guys did a great job.

54
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,080
Special thanks to my pal, Brent.

55
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,360
Somebody has to go to Spain.

56
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:48,840
Somebody.

57
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,960
I mean, yeah, it's whew.

58
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,840
Barcelona is somebody's job.

59
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,500
We didn't want Elle to go alone, right?

60
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,760
I mean, it's not as much fun that way.

61
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,480
Yeah, so Wes and Elle are back from Barcelona this week.

62
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,200
They went to Kubicon, and they grabbed a few really good

63
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,160
insights from the entire event.

64
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,880
We'll share those with you.

65
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,320
And Brent and I are back from our trip

66
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,740
to Clear Linux in Portland, Intel's campus.

67
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,000
We'll tell you all about that.

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,560
There's a ton of stuff to get into.

69
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,480
But before we can do any of the community news

70
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,000
and our own legit form of journalism,

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,160
I want to say time-appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

72
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,000
Hello, mumbles.

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,520
Hello.

74
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,720
Hello.

75
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,560
Hello.

76
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,680
And I do believe, rumor has it, we also have Alex Ellen.

77
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,640
She's here too.

78
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,120
Hey, guys.

79
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,620
Hey.

80
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,280
Hey, what's up?

81
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,440
What up?

82
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,720
Oh, you know, doing a podcast, doing a podcast.

83
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,720
How you doing, Alex?

84
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,560
How are you doing?

85
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,120
Oh, it's 98 here today.

86
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,200
I am melting.

87
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,320
It's too hot.

88
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,120
It's too hot.

89
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,080
Well, geez, I hope your equipment doesn't fall apart.

90
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,720
Yikes.

91
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,120
I'm like on top of the world right now.

92
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,800
I pulled off a thing recently, and it feels good.

93
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,420
You know, something I've been toying with,

94
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,920
doing for a really long time.

95
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,080
It's kind of been a dream.

96
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,680
There's a nice thing happening right now,

97
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,200
that now that all of us are working

98
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,000
full-time for Linux Academy, we're

99
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,720
kind of like infecting each other with Linux enthusiasm.

100
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,420
You wouldn't believe what we did to the studio today,

101
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,800
but that's a story for another time.

102
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,760
It's like being a Windows switcher all over again.

103
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,800
It's so exciting.

104
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,080
And so we keep like, everybody is experimenting

105
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,580
with different stuff right now.

106
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,560
And I decided to tackle hardware pass-through in a VM

107
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,840
on my ThinkPad.

108
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,060
Because those that listen to the show for a while now

109
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,240
may recall that a bit back, I bought one of those GPU docks.

110
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,280
It's a Thunderbolt 3 Lenovo dock with an NVIDIA

111
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,000
1050 built into it.

112
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,180
So you get a discrete graphics card,

113
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,520
and you get all the ports and all that kind of stuff.

114
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,020
Right.

115
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,080
And I got it to work.

116
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,320
It's actually nice, but it has its drawbacks.

117
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,240
Mostly that when you don't have it connected,

118
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,840
the NVIDIA driver goes crazy looking for the hardware.

119
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,500
It's pretty common that you've got this separate graphics

120
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,460
card that mysteriously connects and disconnects,

121
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,920
and not many other systems have that limitation.

122
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,680
No.

123
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,920
So I thought, well, wouldn't it be cool if I just said,

124
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,160
ah, bag it, and let's just pass the entire dock through

125
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,200
to a VM.

126
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,960
Make it simpler on the host system,

127
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,460
and now you have two computers in one.

128
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,160
See, at first I thought I'd pass my GPU through to KVM,

129
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,080
and I'd call it good.

130
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,200
But now going through this, I've learned

131
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,240
that all of the devices that are in that PCI group

132
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,200
have to be allocated to the VM.

133
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,880
So if you've got, say, in this case,

134
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,280
an NVIDIA card that also has an HDMI port with a sound chip

135
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,040
on it, those are both in the same PCI group,

136
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,660
and both have to be removed from the host system

137
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,960
and allocated to the VM.

138
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,040
All or none?

139
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,400
I didn't realize that.

140
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,040
And it gets even more complicated

141
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,880
with a Thunderbolt 3 dock, because you've

142
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,080
got the Thunderbolt 3 bus, you've got the USB adapters,

143
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,840
plus you've got low energy mode bus.

144
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,040
Like, there's multiple things.

145
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,120
So I really did this deep dive on my Fedora 30

146
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,920
install of my ThinkPad of going through and blacklisting

147
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,720
all of these PCI devices and making sure

148
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,880
that the Nuvoo driver wouldn't load and all of this.

149
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,460
But at the end of it, I am happy to say

150
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,200
I successfully managed to allocate the entire Thunderbolt

151
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,840
3 dock to a Windows 10 VM running on my ThinkPad

152
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,880
under Vert Manager.

153
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,600
And just works?

154
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,720
I mean, Windows sees the GPU?

155
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,120
Yes, now, there's one big drawback.

156
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,040
And so I haven't taken the final plunge yet.

157
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,160
In order to get it working, you have

158
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,800
to uninstall the virtual machine graphics card.

159
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,360
You can't have both the VM graphics and the host graphics.

160
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,760
So you've got a little graphics card dance to perform.

161
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,560
And I know how much you love administering Windows.

162
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,640
Yeah, so I was getting everything set up.

163
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,280
It's funny, though, because now the Windows machine is connecting

164
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,680
over the ethernet port on the dock.

165
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,280
And if I don't have the ethernet plugged in,

166
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,720
my Windows VM doesn't have network.

167
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,080
It really is too machined.

168
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,960
It really is.

169
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,760
So I'm going to hook up a mouse and keyboard and a monitor

170
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,120
to the dock, and I will have a separate machine there.

171
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,080
Not really any plans to use it for anything

172
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,600
other than I just wanted to see if I could pull it off.

173
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,040
But so far, it's been really cool.

174
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,960
So now I just got to take the plunge,

175
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,280
remove that virtual graphics card, hook up a monitor,

176
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,160
and see if it works.

177
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,160
If you're on Fedora and you want to mess around

178
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,240
with something like this, Red Hat themselves actually

179
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,720
have decent-ish documentation.

180
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,240
Really?

181
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,000
Mm-hmm.

182
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,920
The problem with all this stuff is it

183
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,080
gets out of date really quick, especially if it's

184
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,800
documentation for RHEL.

185
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,680
So just make sure you double check everything.

186
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,080
Sometimes, like the path for where the grub config

187
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,360
is changed and stuff like that.

188
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,880
PCI passthrough was what got me interested in Linux

189
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,840
in the first place.

190
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,520
I wanted to put one graphics card into my server

191
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,480
so I didn't have to buy another computer because I

192
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,360
was a poor student at the time.

193
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,880
And now it's so easy using OVMF, which support UEFI graphics

194
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,520
cards, that in the old days, you used

195
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,260
to have to eject the GPU before shutting down Windows

196
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,600
because the BIOS on the graphics card

197
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,280
didn't know what was happening.

198
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,640
Whereas now, they support resetting,

199
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,520
and it's just dead easy now.

200
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,960
But if you're interested in this kind of thing,

201
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,600
I highly recommend there's an Arch Linux wiki

202
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,100
article called PCI passthrough via OVMF.

203
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,080
And that takes you through everything

204
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,180
you need to know about this topic and more.

205
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,880
And if you want to reach out to me as well,

206
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,400
I still run this every day.

207
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,040
I have a Windows VM that I use for Lightroom

208
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,800
and other Adobe stuff.

209
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,240
But there's a really cool project

210
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,120
called Looking Glass, which I think you might

211
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,760
want to investigate, Chris.

212
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,560
I actually have it bookmarked right now.

213
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,400
It looks really promising, although it

214
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,480
looks like it's also early days, and it's a little finicky

215
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,740
to install, possibly.

216
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,360
So can you explain what it is and why

217
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
I might want to check it out?

218
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,440
Yeah, I'll do my best because it's not simple.

219
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,320
So when you are outputting graphics

220
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,280
through a graphics card, you are sending frames

221
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,760
to a frame buffer, which then go out through the HDMI port.

222
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,960
So what this guy, I think his name

223
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,720
is Ginniff or Galliff or something is his username.

224
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,960
He worked with Wendell over on level one text

225
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,000
to do some really funky stuff, actually.

226
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,640
You install a driver, which hooks into that frame buffer.

227
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,080
Then on the Linux guest, you run a client,

228
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,160
which can view that frame buffer, which

229
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,900
is a kind of shared piece of memory

230
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,540
between the VM and the host.

231
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,160
And then you can basically, like a VNC window,

232
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,000
just open up the client on your host machine

233
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,800
and view Windows in a window, if that's not

234
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,180
too much of inception for you, with maybe two or three

235
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,800
milliseconds of latency.

236
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,480
It is incredible.

237
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,920
And recently, there was a new plug-in announced

238
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,580
called Scream, or IV Scream or something,

239
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,320
which does audio through that same method as well.

240
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,000
Oh, no kidding.

241
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,560
So in the Windows VM side, it's using DirectX

242
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,920
to do all that frame buffer stuff.

243
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,280
So whatever DirectX can render, as fast as it can render it,

244
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,780
it can toss it in that frame buffer.

245
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,560
It's very high performance.

246
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,960
It's just also very early days and a little finicky.

247
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,560
But it seemed like a great way to get very high performance

248
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,000
Windows without having to have a dedicated monitor, which

249
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,360
is what they were going for.

250
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,720
It's a really interesting kind of journey I ended up on.

251
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,640
Because I think long term, it might

252
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,560
be how I try to solve this issue for my son

253
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,480
if he ever gets in a position where he really

254
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,560
wants Windows 10.

255
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,060
And I want to say thank you, because I

256
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,480
got a couple of audience members who

257
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,480
submitted me part systems from PC Part Picker.

258
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,200
That's great, just a nice little build you can put together.

259
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,660
A couple of really nice ones, including

260
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,640
a nice little small one that uses a case that Linus Tech

261
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,840
Tips just featured.

262
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,340
And I'm really looking forward to doing this rise and build.

263
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,600
But now they just got the new CPUs.

264
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,100
We'll see.

265
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,600
We'll see.

266
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,560
I might have to wait.

267
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,600
So on that note, there is something

268
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,580
to be aware of with Intel versus AMD in this space.

269
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:32,200
So Intel requires for this to work the extension VT-D and VT-X.

270
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,880
AMD have their own, and the name escapes me right now.

271
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,040
But the important thing is that you can pass through IOMMU

272
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,880
groups.

273
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,460
And that's the important thing you want

274
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,360
to look for in any motherboard.

275
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,480
And it can vary down to the exact BIOS version

276
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
on that motherboard.

277
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,680
So sometimes the only way to be sure it's actually going to work

278
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,000
is to buy the product and try it out.

279
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,600
So buy it from Amazon, because you can send it back

280
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,760
if it doesn't work.

281
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Yeah, so those IMMOU groups, if I'm getting that right,

282
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,260
is like what I was talking about where

283
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,760
you have a couple of PCI devices that are grouped together,

284
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,440
like an NVIDIA graphics card, GPU,

285
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,560
as well as the HDMI audio output.

286
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,440
And anytime you have devices that are essentially

287
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,960
like that in the same group, they all

288
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,500
have to be allocated at once to the virtual machine.

289
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,320
It's all or nothing, which is tricky, but doable.

290
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,720
There is a kernel patch you can apply

291
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,360
called ACS, which can sometimes break down those IOMMU groups

292
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,040
into smaller chunks.

293
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,000
So occasionally, I mean, into my Arch install right now

294
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,640
in front of me, I have that kernel patch installed,

295
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,960
which enables me to only pass through a couple of devices

296
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,680
instead of 10 or 15.

297
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,880
So I can have two GPUs in the same system,

298
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,520
pass one through, and leave the other one

299
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,720
with the host, for example.

300
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,500
So there are ways around these things,

301
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,800
but it does get quite involved quite fast.

302
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,520
Yeah, but nothing more than maybe an evening or two.

303
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,100
That's about how I would sum it up.

304
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,160
Nowadays, you're absolutely right, yeah.

305
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,640
That's nice.

306
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,120
I mean, not super simple, but something someone

307
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,960
looking for a project could easily handle.

308
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,400
And then once you have it done, you essentially

309
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,520
have two computers out of one.

310
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,920
And what I'm really trying to get out of this,

311
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,440
I was telling you this yesterday,

312
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,080
is I just kind of feel like I'm done repartitioning

313
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,720
my disk for a while.

314
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,640
I've got a really solid base install on that Fedora 30

315
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,800
on that ThinkPad.

316
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,400
I mean, I may have to repave just

317
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,060
to be compatible with the studio machines,

318
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,520
but right now, Fedora 30 is working so good.

319
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,000
And if I can avoid having to reload that system

320
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,080
by using things like virtualization

321
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,120
with hardware pass-through and kexec, hey-o, I might.

322
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,800
I might try to make it like the entire release of Fedora

323
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,160
30 without repartitioning.

324
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,740
You're in love with this installation.

325
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,520
I can tell, right?

326
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,800
You don't want to make any changes.

327
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,960
You're trying to figure out anything

328
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,560
you can do to make stuff work on Fedora, which has actually

329
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,120
proven pretty possible.

330
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,240
Yeah, it's been really good.

331
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,920
All right.

332
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,680
Oh, there's our warning that we've

333
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,720
waded off into the weeds.

334
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,180
Let's get into some community news.

335
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,080
What do you say?

336
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,240
Start with speaking of Ubuntu, Ubuntu 19.10

337
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,780
is going to have a new trick.

338
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,640
It's going to bundle NVIDIA's proprietary driver right

339
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,480
into the ISO.

340
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,600
The NVIDIA binary drivers won't be activated by default,

341
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,680
but they will be present on the install media

342
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,720
to make it easier to turn on afterwards.

343
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,680
Yeah, that's right.

344
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,960
Novu will still be the default if you've

345
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,880
got an NVIDIA graphics card on new Ubuntu installations.

346
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,240
Really, the change is just positioning the mainline

347
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,000
and legacy proprietary drivers onto the actual ISO

348
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,640
so it can be easily obtained locally post-install, right?

349
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,200
So maybe you have a system set up.

350
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,960
You want to use the proprietary drivers.

351
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,200
You might not have internet after or during installation.

352
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,120
You don't need it now for that.

353
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,460
I guess the not having internet thing

354
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,320
is a business customer request.

355
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,400
I guess I got the word that that trickled down

356
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,400
from requests on large installations in enterprises.

357
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,640
I mean, it is nice when you can sort of do all these things

358
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,360
and not have to futz with gateways.

359
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,040
Do you care that it made the ISO bigger?

360
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,560
Not really.

361
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,600
I usually use something like the Bootstrap

362
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,680
anyway to build my systems from a more minimal ISO anyway.

363
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,760
A lot of people seem to be super excited about the new ZFS

364
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,300
on Linux 0.8 release that came out in the last week.

365
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,880
I guess there's some pretty nice features

366
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,200
that people have been waiting for for quite a long time.

367
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,880
Oh, yeah, things like native encryption support,

368
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,040
as well as raw encrypted ZFS send and receive support,

369
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,040
which, man, send and receive stuff is just great.

370
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,280
Another prominent feature is support for device removal

371
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,480
and pooled checkpoints, as well as trim or discard

372
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,520
for solid state drives.

373
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,480
All of those things people have been waiting for

374
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,840
to be shipped as part of ZFS.

375
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,360
Now, in the past, you could layer things together, right?

376
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,680
You could use Lux and ZFS or some other combination.

377
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,480
This just means ZFS has more features.

378
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,080
And since it already does, I don't know, everything,

379
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,240
violates all the layers, eats everything related

380
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,040
to the file system and disks, now it does more of those things.

381
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,600
If you trust ZFS, you're probably

382
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,720
going to like these changes.

383
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,880
Yeah, I mean, I think the encryption support's huge,

384
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,360
right?

385
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,720
And so is the trim support.

386
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,000
That's for solid state drives.

387
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,960
That's massive.

388
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,480
And hey, OK, Python 3 compatibility with its tools,

389
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,640
the conversion marches on.

390
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,240
OK.

391
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,720
Yeah, you're right.

392
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,320
You're right.

393
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,640
You're right.

394
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,240
Have you seen what?

395
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,720
There's a website now that tracks

396
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,200
how many days, hours, and months left until Python 2.7,

397
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,960
whatever.

398
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,680
Good for them.

399
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,120
Yeah, right?

400
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,280
I mean, steady improvements.

401
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,880
Are you running this anywhere?

402
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,680
I have not updated to this release.

403
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,840
But I do use ZFS on Linux.

404
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,520
Yeah, of course.

405
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,520
Do you?

406
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,040
Who do you think I am?

407
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,560
Where?

408
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,880
I mean, on my, like, arrays at home.

409
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,480
Now, I do still have one that needs

410
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,000
to get converted that's on ButterFS.

411
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,560
But that's just kind of been something

412
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
to watch and to play with.

413
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,680
How many arrays you got?

414
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,960
You got ButterFS arrays.

415
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
You got ZFS arrays.

416
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,880
Yeah, right?

417
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,320
Now, there aren't any Bcache ones right now.

418
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,680
I need to, or Stratus.

419
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,160
So I'm not that hipster.

420
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
I got to work on that.

421
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,520
Yeah, man.

422
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,480
Get your Stratus set up.

423
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,120
What the heck?

424
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,520
Alex, you got any Stratus rolling

425
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,040
at home in your home lab with the new fancy rack I saw.

426
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,000
Congratulations.

427
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,520
Thank you.

428
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,400
Yeah, I had some offcuts of wood left around.

429
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
So I thought, get it off the floor,

430
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,040
away from the spiders that jump.

431
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,480
Built himself a server rack.

432
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,280
Nice.

433
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,040
Very nice.

434
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,840
So you got any ZFS or ButterFS or Stratus

435
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,040
rolling any of that stuff?

436
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,600
So after listening to a couple of episodes of TechSnap

437
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,560
where Jim and Wes evangelized it and going

438
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,080
to the talks at Linux Fest Northwest from Jim

439
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,080
and the one and only Alan Jude, they

440
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,880
convinced me that I was missing out

441
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,680
by not having some ZFS in my life.

442
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,320
And yeah, I've given it a go.

443
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,520
And I'm presenting a ZFS pair now.

444
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,240
And then on top of it, I'm using MergerFS

445
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,480
to kind of blend it in with my normal.

446
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,080
There you go.

447
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,600
Very neat.

448
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,920
Normal storage stuff.

449
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,920
So anything I really care about is now on ZFS.

450
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,440
Anything I don't care about is just on the JBOD MergerFS

451
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,720
kind of XT4 drives.

452
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,320
So yeah, I'm using ZFS.

453
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,440
Oh no, I said Z. I'm turning into an American.

454
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,360
We're getting there.

455
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,680
Yeah, so I'm using it for a bit.

456
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,320
And I must be honest, the learning curve I felt like

457
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,080
was quite steep because I feel like if you make an array,

458
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,160
if you make a pair, like a pool, wrong on day one,

459
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,360
that can have some serious ramifications in a year

460
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,000
or two's time when you're trying to recover data.

461
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,360
So I wanted to make sure I was right.

462
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,000
So I ran everything past Alan and Jim,

463
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and they said it was OK.

464
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,880
So so far, so good.

465
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,760
Welcome to BSD Unplugged, your weekly BSD talk show

466
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,240
that's too busy getting actual work done

467
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,520
to care about what your silly display server.

468
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,200
My name is Alan.

469
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,480
Alan Jude.

470
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,720
You know, Chris, you don't want to touch your install.

471
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,440
I'm thinking it's time to pave my ThinkPad.

472
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,240
And you know what?

473
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,680
It's probably going to have ZFS on route

474
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,720
on this next generation.

475
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,560
I think so.

476
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,520
What distro?

477
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,160
Sticking with Ubuntu or?

478
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
Probably, but that's most likely.

479
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,880
I haven't convinced you to try Fedora 30, huh?

480
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,040
I think I'll have set it up.

481
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,920
There may be some room for a Fedora installer too on there.

482
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,560
Or at least a K, exactly.

483
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,600
Well, maybe the biggest hoopla news this week

484
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,320
in the desktop Linux community has

485
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,280
been this big post by a group of GNOME application developers.

486
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,040
Stop theming my.app.

487
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,840
Please don't theme our apps.

488
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,560
An open letter from independent app developers

489
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,440
to the wider GNOME community.

490
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,720
This is all about users that are changing the themes

491
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,040
on their GNOME desktop, and in the opinion

492
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,400
of these developers, breaking their apps

493
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,400
because they're now inconsistent with how the application

494
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,200
developer had designed them.

495
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,080
Isn't this fascinating?

496
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,640
Right on the heels of our conversation with Cassidy

497
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,400
last week about this.

498
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,120
By the way, congratulations to Cassidy, who is now a new dad.

499
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,880
That's wonderful.

500
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,120
Like, he was just on the show last week right before that.

501
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,680
That's some commitment.

502
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,840
And was talking about trying to create a free desktop

503
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,640
standard around dark theming.

504
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,600
Because a big part of why people are switching their theme

505
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,360
is to go dark.

506
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,480
They want the dark theme, yeah, of course.

507
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,200
Not everybody, but a big part of it.

508
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,120
I'll raise my hand.

509
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,440
That's right, me too.

510
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,800
They say, all of our efforts designing, developing,

511
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,440
and testing our apps are made futile by theming in many cases.

512
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,900
And they do have a couple of examples.

513
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,600
Yeah, they do.

514
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,800
Things like GTK style sheets.

515
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,400
Well, they can make applications look broken,

516
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,520
and sometimes in corner cases, unusable.

517
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,060
Icon themes can change icon metaphors,

518
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,920
leading to interfaces with icons that

519
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,240
don't express what the developer actually intended.

520
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,560
And app icons, well, they're the identity of an application.

521
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,080
So changing an app's icon denies the developer the possibility

522
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,540
to control their brand.

523
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,600
I really actually kind of agree with that last point the most.

524
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,080
I think that is true.

525
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,240
And I think at the user individual level,

526
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,480
the offense is mild.

527
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,080
But it's a much bigger deal when you

528
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,800
have a large distribution that does it,

529
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,320
because by default, out of the box,

530
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,560
it's changed for the users.

531
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,320
You know, it's interesting.

532
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,760
I'm not sure at some point, there

533
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,320
was a section of open source, maybe just free,

534
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,360
I don't know, open source software that, I don't know,

535
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,520
in the past we would say had a brand, right?

536
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,600
I mean, if it's some code in a repository.

537
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,200
But now things are thought of as apps, right?

538
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
We're using those terms, and they have brands.

539
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,600
Everything has a brand.

540
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,560
And of course, there's trademarked art and logos.

541
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,840
And there is a brand, but we're taking that more seriously.

542
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,880
And maybe there's older schools of thoughts

543
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,320
about how open source software is shipped.

544
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,720
It does seem to be a confliction of those two things,

545
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,680
doesn't it?

546
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,680
You're right.

547
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,800
We now live in a world where people want Thunderbird

548
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,280
and GIMP to look like Thunderbird and GIMP.

549
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,800
And developers want to be able to ship an application expecting

550
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,840
a style sheet to look a certain way.

551
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,240
And then you have distributions that sort of make it

552
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,760
a point of pride to customize the distribution

553
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,560
to represent their brand.

554
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,000
This is not a new thing either.

555
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,280
We kind of touched on this about six months ago.

556
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,160
We said, hey, this thing is brewing out there

557
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,000
in the community, especially in the GNOME community.

558
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,200
And now we're really seeing it being taken to the next level.

559
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
And there's also a response to this letter

560
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,680
that tries to point out in its own letter

561
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,520
that this crap's open source.

562
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,720
So no matter what you do, we can still get to it and theme it.

563
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,760
And it is, quite frankly, much, much, much cheaper for us

564
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,000
to re-theme these things than it is for us to create new ones

565
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,120
from whole cloth.

566
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,000
And as long as it's free and legal for us to do so,

567
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and the code's right there, it's always

568
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,560
going to be in our best interest to re-theme this stuff.

569
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,280
So why don't we just try to come to some common ground?

570
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah, that does seem like a good approach, right?

571
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Acknowledge it's going to happen.

572
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,420
Maybe we can build things in a way

573
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,360
that at least mitigates some of the worst

574
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,360
cases of their examples, which, I mean, those do happen.

575
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,840
They make a good point here, Cheez,

576
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,080
and I want to get your thoughts on this.

577
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,080
They say, the problem we're facing

578
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,800
is the expectation that apps can be arbitrary restyled

579
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:43,400
without manual work, which is and has always been an illusion.

580
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,020
Like, if you restyle it, there's things

581
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,200
that have to be fixed up and tweaked and changed.

582
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,820
That's just not how design works.

583
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,200
Well, I think that, first off, if you want Linux

584
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,120
on the desktop, these are growing pains for that, right?

585
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,720
Everybody, like you said, they want GIMP to look like GIMP.

586
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,560
They want Firebird to, you know, Thunderbird

587
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,720
to look like Thunderbird, so on and so forth.

588
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,920
And it is free and open source.

589
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,660
So regardless of how they feel, people

590
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,240
are still going to iterate on this,

591
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,080
and they're going to continue to do what they do.

592
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,720
I mean, I think that we do need to find some common ground,

593
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,480
a kind of unified standard that everything can be designed

594
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,280
under to some extent.

595
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,980
But that's also part of the reason

596
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,520
that I got into Linux was because you

597
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,440
could tinker with it and change it and make it

598
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
into what you wanted.

599
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,160
So to say that all of a sudden this isn't cool, guys,

600
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,640
stop doing this, I think is just you're

601
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,120
pushing people away from these different distros in Linux

602
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,680
in general.

603
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:52,280
As for the iconography and the branding and redoing that,

604
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,960
you know, that comes on the heels of the purism stuff,

605
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,060
too, and them lifting some icons that maybe they

606
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,400
weren't OKed to use.

607
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,680
So to me, that's the bigger problem,

608
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,360
is that if you take something and brand it as your own

609
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,520
and then put it into something that's

610
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,240
going to be made commercially available,

611
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,800
there's a problem with that.

612
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,360
And you should not do that.

613
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,920
From a moral standpoint, really.

614
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,880
Absolutely.

615
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,000
Absolutely.

616
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,800
Part of me thinks with this whole situation

617
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,120
and Cassidy talking last week and Gnome and just everything

618
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,240
that's going down, I see why elementary kind of went

619
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,120
its own way to develop its own thing.

620
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,960
Right, they might have the most sane approach

621
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,560
when you play this whole thing out long term,

622
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,440
especially if they work in a dark mode.

623
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,520
Absolutely, man.

624
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,880
And they will, right, because they're

625
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,800
listening to the feedback, and they're

626
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,240
going to respond to that feedback.

627
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,640
So they absolutely will.

628
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,760
And I expect that when they do it, they're going to nail it.

629
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,880
They're going to do it right.

630
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
I want to pick up on something you said earlier.

631
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,880
You said one of the things that drew you to desktop Linux

632
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,160
was the ability to theme it.

633
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,520
And I'm going to echo that.

634
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,100
I thought that was like, oh, this is next level power user.

635
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,060
Because you remember one of the stupid things

636
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,600
you could do in early Windows that you

637
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,040
could get that stupid plus pack?

638
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,320
Oh, right.

639
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,160
Window blinds, I think it was called.

640
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,800
Yes.

641
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,840
Or you could go third party and do window blinds.

642
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,640
Yeah.

643
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,360
I thought that was the bee's knees, man.

644
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,760
It was kind of the first step in.

645
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,600
Oh, look at all the tweaks I can make.

646
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,520
So the fact that that was built into my desktop

647
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,960
was like, oh, I'm amongst my people.

648
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,520
You know, that's what I mean.

649
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,320
But I also completely connect with where these developers are

650
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,400
coming from.

651
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,640
It is probably one of the most frustrating experiences

652
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,680
in the world to build something and care about it

653
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,400
and then release it.

654
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,520
And an end user has a bad experience,

655
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,960
not because of a bug you've introduced,

656
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,080
but because of something that happened simply by a style

657
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,240
sheet that developer never expected hiding something,

658
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,800
making something hard to recognize,

659
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,720
making the UI less intuitive, or even break in some cases.

660
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,480
And they do have some examples where that happens.

661
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,920
I would imagine that's got to be supremely frustrating,

662
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,240
because it's just something that's totally

663
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,080
out of your control.

664
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,880
Like, you did everything right.

665
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,160
You made something good.

666
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,760
It wasn't a bug you've created, and yet the user

667
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,440
is still hitting a wall.

668
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,720
And you've got to sit there and go, this is impossible.

669
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,960
I could never be successful.

670
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,120
And I could see how they'd want to get together.

671
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,680
They'd probably get together at events and kind of thinking,

672
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,080
we got to do something about this.

673
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,120
This has been in the works for a long time.

674
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,000
When you look at the developers that are on this list,

675
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,720
a bunch of great apps on here that I like.

676
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,040
The maintainer of podcasts, the maintainer of UberRider,

677
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,840
and Fractal, and Gnome Games, and Lollipop, and Passbook,

678
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,000
and Authenticator, amongst others, are on this list.

679
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,640
So I think even if you as an end user react to this and say,

680
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,240
don't take away my theming, which I can also completely

681
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,720
connect with, I think it's worth hearing them out,

682
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,960
because we got to find some common ground here.

683
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,600
And this is a direction that I think

684
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,920
is going to become more and more important to these developers

685
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,360
on the Gnome side of things.

686
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,480
Well, I think, like I said, this is a growing pain

687
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,520
for desktop Linux, right?

688
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,360
At some point, we're going to have

689
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,200
to come to this crossroads where we say, hey, guys,

690
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,400
everybody that's developing a distro around Gnome,

691
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,200
we need to set some common goals for Gnome and how we style

692
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,720
things, what's expected to be here,

693
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,880
what's not expected to be here, and then cut you loose

694
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,240
and let you do what you do best and create

695
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,040
an awesome distro for us.

696
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:35,120
I think, too, in a way, if we don't figure this out,

697
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,640
if you ever did have a Photoshop, or a Premiere,

698
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,120
or one of those applications like AutoCAD

699
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,080
that people live in to do their jobs,

700
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,080
and it's one of the top of the list of things

701
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,360
we really need on Linux for people to switch,

702
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,440
you think they're going to use GTK or Qt,

703
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,520
and then have the user themes or distro themes

704
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,160
break the experience?

705
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,520
No, they're going to build their own custom toolkits.

706
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,160
They're going to build their own custom UI elements.

707
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,560
And they're going to ship that, just because they can't.

708
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,680
I mean, that's what Reaper does.

709
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,160
Yeah, right.

710
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,840
I mean, we're using Reaper right here to record the show,

711
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,160
and that's exactly what they do.

712
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,240
It's kind of a shame, though, because then you

713
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,040
don't get to take advantage of all those new technologies.

714
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,240
Yeah, that's true.

715
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,560
It is like a cheese as a growing pain, I guess.

716
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,880
Yeah, we are having, instead of them shipping this thing that's

717
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,800
meant as a blank canvas that you sort of drop on and theme

718
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,600
and customize, they have a higher level goal, right?

719
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,880
They're trying to make this whole end-to-end package

720
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,480
and experience for you.

721
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,800
And that does mean pruning some branches.

722
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,720
You're just not really allowed to go down.

723
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,640
Couple of housekeeping items today.

724
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,360
So I think for this one, I say we kick off the Joe

725
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,280
Rez original.

726
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,720
Let's do it.

727
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,680
Now, first up and foremost, this weekend, ladies

728
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:48,600
and gentlemen, it is finally here, Texas Linux Fest 2019.

729
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,280
It's happening.

730
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,680
It's happening May 31 through June 1.

731
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,120
Link in the show notes.

732
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,520
And there'll be a family dinner, too, Friday night

733
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,000
at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for details

734
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,640
on that if you're going to Texas Linux Fest

735
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,360
and you want to hang out with Elle and I and others.

736
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,480
I almost got it up.

737
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,680
Cheese and Alex aren't going to be there till later.

738
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,600
They're missing the dinner?

739
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,200
They're going to be there, though, but just not till later.

740
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,200
I actually might get there a little earlier now.

741
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,120
Really, girl?

742
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,840
Yeah, you know that.

743
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,080
I did not know that, actually.

744
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,760
That's great.

745
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,480
Well, you do now.

746
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,360
That's great.

747
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,320
Because otherwise, Elle and I are just

748
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,360
going to totally talk trash about you the entire time.

749
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,920
It might still happen, but.

750
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,880
That's never stopped me.

751
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,380
Shocker.

752
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,960
All right, OK.

753
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,000
So that's coming up really, really soon.

754
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,880
And I know a lot of you can't be there,

755
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,080
but if you're going to be there, I'd

756
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,880
love to see you at the meetup.

757
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,600
I want to also mention, now that we're doing the housekeeping,

758
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,160
Friday stream, fridastream.com slash 5.

759
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,880
I've got some big news.

760
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,500
You know, I've been thinking about this.

761
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,520
A lot of our shows, like this show,

762
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,600
it's about Linux and the open source community.

763
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,400
Oh, that's what it's about.

764
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:51,920
OK, OK.

765
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,840
Linux Action News, you know, same thing.

766
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,760
You've got to eat it.

767
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,720
But this show, the Friday stream, it's really about us.

768
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,840
It's just totally a selfish show.

769
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,040
It's really about the people that

770
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,960
make these shows possible.

771
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,720
Yeah, they're warning.

772
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,840
Their stories.

773
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,160
And some of the stories we're interested in that

774
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,720
don't fit in other shows.

775
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,480
Ways to express the stuff we are interested in, yeah.

776
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,320
We did talk about some SpaceX stuff in that one.

777
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
Yeah, why don't you talk about all the space stuff

778
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,360
when I'm not on it?

779
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,040
I know.

780
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,320
Yeah, you've got to come on the next one, actually.

781
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,560
There's a problem that came up in the show that only Westpac can solve.

782
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,240
That's how Brendan and I ended up going to Portland.

783
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,160
In the Friday stream, we were chatting about it.

784
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,840
And in this last one, I'm sharing some life.

785
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,320
The wife joins, and we share some big news, some big news.

786
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,040
Fridaystream.com slash five.

787
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,360
Yeah, things happen on Fridays.

788
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,080
You've got to watch it.

789
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,480
Also, speaking of things happening, we should mention

790
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,760
Linux Academy just did a bunch of new content updates

791
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,080
and just recently pushed out 26 new hands-on labs

792
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,760
with a new interface and a lot more.

793
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
26?

794
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,440
No better way to learn than actually doing.

795
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,560
And a great example of this is if you just finally

796
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,720
want to completely wrap your head around SELinux,

797
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,840
a hands-on lab is such a great way to do it.

798
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,240
There's probably no other way to get it, right?

799
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,600
Yeah.

800
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:56,840
Yeah.

801
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,560
Also, the community edition will begin its June rotation soon.

802
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,720
So if you're not a community member at Linux Academy,

803
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,400
which is the free account where Elle maintains a fresh rotation,

804
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,640
go sign up over there.

805
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,900
And we'll have a link to the Linux Academy weekly update,

806
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,560
which has some information about the new UI stuff and the new labs.

807
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,240
Go check out the YouTube channel at linuxacademycom on YouTube.

808
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,440
Some good stuff there.

809
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,240
Also, speaking of the community edition,

810
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,760
the mobile app has that now, too.

811
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,040
So you can get in on that stuff.

812
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,640
There you go.

813
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,000
Right there, ladies and gentlemen.

814
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,200
That is the housekeeping, as I have it, at least.

815
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,240
Did I miss anything?

816
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,200
I think you got it all.

817
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,960
Perfect.

818
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,480
Thank you.

819
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,760
10 out of 10.

820
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,280
Thank you.

821
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,920
Big shout out to Alex over there for working on that UI, UX

822
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,680
stuff, man.

823
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,480
Yes, it looks good.

824
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:41,980
It does.

825
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,480
I know.

826
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,040
They got a good team over there.

827
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,560
So we have been doing some legit straight up journalism.

828
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,040
I feel so proud of us as a team right now,

829
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,640
because we are covering multiple events across the world

830
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,560
at the same time.

831
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,880
And I don't know, man.

832
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,200
It's just like big time.

833
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,160
It's something we could never have done on our own.

834
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,920
And that was part of a large organization.

835
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,200
I just feel like we can crush some of these things.

836
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,600
And so Elle had an opportunity to go to Kubicon,

837
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,520
and she decided she would bring Westpain.

838
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,480
Drug me alone.

839
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,920
So it was a great event, because I got to hang out with, what,

840
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,560
7,000 of my closest friends.

841
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,080
And the keynote was really focused

842
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,600
on the concept of diversity.

843
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,060
Well, the keynote on the first day,

844
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,580
there were lots of keynotes.

845
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,680
And they really did a lot to promote the diversity that

846
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,000
was going on for not only the projects,

847
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,940
but the contributors behind the work.

848
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,080
That's great to hear.

849
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,880
Well, let's fast forward to, I believe, it's Friday.

850
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,360
Westpain wakes up and takes us on a stroll to the keynote.

851
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,200
This is obviously a huge year for Kubernetes and the Cloud

852
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,080
Native Computing Foundation.

853
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,800
The estimates I've heard is that there's

854
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,140
7,700 attendees this year.

855
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:58,600
And keep in mind, Kubernetes didn't get a 1.0 until 2014.

856
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,580
And I know, we keep calling this KubeCon.

857
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,680
But really, it's KubeCon and the Cloud Native Computing

858
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,760
Foundation convention, because that's a big part of it.

859
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,520
Sure, Kubernetes is the platform.

860
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,040
But the Cloud Native family of tools and open source

861
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,480
utilities, they tie this all together.

862
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,080
And that's a lot of what people are here to talk about today.

863
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
Yes, you're probably running Kubernetes.

864
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,800
But maybe you're just running Fluentd.

865
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,680
I've also been very pleased to note

866
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,760
that while there are plenty of business, marketing, sales,

867
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,480
and the usual assortment of team members,

868
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,240
there are a lot of engineers here.

869
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,140
You can tell, you walk up to any of the booths

870
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,720
in the sponsor showcase, or you just

871
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,040
look around at the clothes people are wearing

872
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,960
and the name tags, and you can tell the people that are here.

873
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,600
Sure, there's operators and sys admins.

874
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,520
But primarily, it's application developers.

875
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,960
These are people who are using Kubernetes and users excited

876
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,420
about the possibilities of this platform.

877
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,200
And that's a big difference when you compare it

878
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,120
to something like the Open Infrastructure

879
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,680
Summit and the OpenStack community, which

880
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,240
is a lot more focused on the people running the software

881
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,400
and not the people targeting the software.

882
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,240
All right, now I'm going to play a couple of moments

883
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,560
from that keynote that Mr. Westpain was hustling

884
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,920
to from his hotel.

885
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,240
So yes, Kubernetes in 2019.

886
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,840
Don't stop believing.

887
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,240
So let me set this talk.

888
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:31,300
So there's been 31,000 contributors to Kubernetes.

889
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,040
Oh my god.

890
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,360
That's a lot of contributors.

891
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,840
That is a lot of ideas.

892
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,840
That is a lot of thoughts.

893
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,680
That's a lot of time.

894
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,260
And if you sit in the SIG meetings

895
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,720
and you see how the sausage is made,

896
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,960
you understand, wow, that's crazy.

897
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,960
If you look at Slack, that's crazy.

898
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,120
There's been 164,000 commits.

899
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,040
This is a large, large project.

900
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,040
Brian is a VMware senior software engineer.

901
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,820
And he makes one other point that I

902
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,760
want to play before we circle back to this that I thought

903
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,960
was very interesting and I want to get West's take on.

904
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,280
Kubernetes is a cloud-native platform for building platforms.

905
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,160
Sounds weird.

906
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,560
A lot of people don't think about it that way.

907
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,080
Kubernetes is not the end.

908
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,840
It's not a product.

909
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,700
Unless you're a cloud or a vendor,

910
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,600
you don't get anything from selling Kubernetes.

911
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,920
The real power of Kubernetes is what it allows you to build.

912
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,880
And that's how I want us to think about it.

913
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,640
Kubernetes is a cloud-native platform

914
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,200
for building platforms.

915
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,920
And then this was West's thoughts

916
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,960
right after that keynote, which we'll pick up from.

917
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,080
That wraps up the keynote for the day, the last and final day

918
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,240
of KubeCon EU 2019.

919
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,960
I think the theme of don't stop believing

920
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,760
is very much on point because there's

921
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,760
something of a tacit acknowledgment here.

922
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,300
It's an undercurrent buried a bit below the hype.

923
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,300
There's a lot of companies here, and a lot of them

924
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,880
are using and working with Kubernetes.

925
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,040
But there's an open question of, how much of this is production?

926
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,960
I think, by and large, most of what people are doing

927
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,040
is still in the exploratory stage.

928
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,400
And we saw that, as Brian mentioned in the keynote.

929
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,140
Kubernetes didn't graduate as a CNCF project

930
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,940
until about a year ago.

931
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,000
March 2018.

932
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,800
And that was the date when they started to say to the world,

933
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,520
look, Kubernetes might be ready for you.

934
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,760
It's one thing if you're a developer, or an advocate,

935
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,200
or someone at the forefront who really

936
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,460
does have the largest problems.

937
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,600
Maybe you're someone like Amazon, or Microsoft,

938
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,200
or Google.

939
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,060
OK, maybe you need to develop that.

940
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,520
It's very different if you're trying to just use

941
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,040
this platform, or platform for a platform, as they said,

942
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,000
to develop things.

943
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,160
So don't stop believing is a call, a call to action,

944
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,280
a call to continued action.

945
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,920
Many companies have begun the journey to Kubernetes.

946
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,920
And while there's so many problems left, right?

947
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,460
I mean, stateful applications, from Brian's point of view,

948
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,760
are still something of a maybe.

949
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,360
But you can see the momentum.

950
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:18,120
I mean, 7,000 attendees here, engineers, business leaders,

951
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,200
everyone.

952
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,960
And there is an embrace of this common tooling.

953
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,840
Kubernetes, all of the cloud-native,

954
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,640
computing foundations, projects.

955
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,080
The theme is that instead of hiding away in data centers,

956
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,900
because we're all using the cloud,

957
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,480
because we all have very similar goals,

958
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,960
there's this democratization, standardization

959
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,900
of the base layer of computing.

960
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,360
Whether you're on a cloud provider,

961
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,280
or doing a little more work, and rolling your own hybrid,

962
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,320
or on-prem solution, these tools are all designed

963
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,040
not as full products, but as components of a solution,

964
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,600
so that you, a vendor, a consultant, your engineers,

965
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,200
can work together to take these components

966
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,680
and build your own custom solution.

967
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,120
But at the same time, leaving a robust, upstream path,

968
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,800
a way that, regardless of what company you work on,

969
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,600
there's a community.

970
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,440
There's a community of engineers all working on the same stuff,

971
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,400
because these tools are a common business goal.

972
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,040
It's a common business platform, too.

973
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,960
So LL, I'm curious, since you were at DockerCon,

974
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,560
you said it almost felt like Docker

975
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,960
was in the shadow of Kubernetes.

976
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,320
Now that you've gone to KubeCon, is this the common platform?

977
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,280
Did you get the other part of that picture?

978
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,840
I think that it's definitely going

979
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,040
to be when the worlds collide kind of concept,

980
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,920
because I walk in, and I start seeing people

981
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,760
from the Docker community from day one.

982
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,920
There are so many of the contributors of actual Docker

983
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,040
ink staff there.

984
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,680
They had a booth there.

985
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,240
I think they really are wanting to just be that underlying

986
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,160
container runtime for Kubernetes as a standard.

987
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,540
I'm thinking that's where they're

988
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,800
going to head to their bet.

989
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,000
That's just my opinion.

990
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,040
I didn't have anyone confirm it, but that's really

991
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,880
what it feels like.

992
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,400
That seems like if I was going to put money,

993
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,280
if we had betting, if we could bet on this kind of stuff?

994
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,360
Next time, next time.

995
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,240
We should come up with something.

996
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,480
Overall impressions, L, of not just the size of the conference,

997
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,640
because it sounds like it was huge, but just comparison

998
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,400
to other industry events and the things

999
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,760
that they tried to cover.

1000
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,480
What was your takeaway in that regard?

1001
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,760
You know, I come in from more of the community architect

1002
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,960
mindset of, how are we going to build the community?

1003
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,800
How are we going to get the contributors?

1004
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
And one thing I just kept talking to Wes about

1005
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,280
is how distant this conference feels compared to others.

1006
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,460
When I would go to Open Infrastructure at the time,

1007
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,720
Open Stack Summit, there were a lot of user groups that meet.

1008
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,300
There are established dinners, established times

1009
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,200
to go in and talk about contributing to the project.

1010
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,580
And it really is about building up and fostering

1011
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,840
that contributor groundwork so people

1012
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,740
want to spend the time helping this project grow.

1013
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,280
I didn't really feel that at the Kubernetes conference.

1014
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,880
I just really felt that it was more vendor-targeted,

1015
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,380
more trying to sell, more trying to get the name out there.

1016
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,280
The keynotes were great with the message,

1017
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,600
but I didn't feel there was any follow-through.

1018
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,800
I think if you were to attend and you're one person in 7,000,

1019
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,880
it would be easy just to get lost in the bunch

1020
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,880
and not really get your money's worth

1021
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,440
or find out how to become a contributor

1022
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,240
or a part of the community.

1023
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,120
Hmm.

1024
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,000
It did seem like they made some efforts,

1025
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,720
like there was a mental health in tech talk, it sounded like.

1026
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,160
That's something, but not quite connecting

1027
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,520
with what you're talking about.

1028
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,680
Yeah, it was more like, here's some information.

1029
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,920
Take it in.

1030
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,320
But then what?

1031
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,600
It's like handing somebody a deck of cards,

1032
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,920
but not really showing them what to do with it,

1033
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,960
where I felt that DockerCon with their hallway tracks,

1034
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,520
and I've already talked about OpenStack, really

1035
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,060
kind of give you the tools and then say, OK, go over there,

1036
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,960
and we'll teach you what you're going to do next.

1037
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,000
Is that your impression too, Wes?

1038
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,960
Yeah, it seemed like they were talking the right talk.

1039
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,720
They had the right intentions, perhaps.

1040
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,800
They want to find ways to have more contributors

1041
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,600
or find users and turn them into contributors,

1042
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,240
but it's not very fleshed out yet.

1043
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,000
So unless you already have enough motivation

1044
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,920
that maybe you're using one of these tools at work,

1045
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,480
so you're familiar and you started sending pull requests,

1046
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,600
that sort of person I'm sure could make their way.

1047
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,320
But if you're just an interested party coming in,

1048
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,900
you would feel pretty disconnected.

1049
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,000
Can we talk for a second about that message

1050
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,360
of don't stop believing?

1051
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,760
Seems like they sort of hit on that a couple of times.

1052
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,680
Like that was the key part of the keynote there.

1053
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,440
So yes, Kubernetes in 2019, don't stop believing.

1054
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,640
What's that about?

1055
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,200
Why drive that message home?

1056
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,960
Well, there's just been a lot of change,

1057
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,320
and it's not that old of a project.

1058
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,360
So you're just now seeing things like financial firms

1059
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:37,360
or telcos or large scientific institutions moving over

1060
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,560
to Kubernetes.

1061
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,680
There's been a lot of gains.

1062
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,120
There's huge adopters that all the cloud services,

1063
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,120
all the cloud providers provide these Kubernetes services.

1064
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,440
But we're not even, I mean, to be fair,

1065
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,960
we're not even fully out of the hype cycle yet.

1066
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,160
Yes, exactly, right.

1067
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,800
So there's a long way to go and there's a lot of work.

1068
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,680
I liked he had a slide, Brian had a slide there

1069
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,240
where he said, this is old advice.

1070
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,600
And it was talking about stateful applications

1071
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,440
on Kubernetes and you shouldn't do it.

1072
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,520
And he goes, well, here's my new advice.

1073
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,200
Slide is replaced just with the word maybe.

1074
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,240
And so it's not there, right?

1075
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,600
Like Kubernetes isn't finished.

1076
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,760
There's not, it's not some ultimate solution,

1077
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,400
but there's, along with Kubernetes

1078
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,560
and the whole suite of cloud native applications,

1079
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,520
they're all communally building building blocks

1080
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,360
they can further their businesses with.

1081
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,120
And I think that's been a lot of it is leaving,

1082
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,640
so we saw the merger of two projects,

1083
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,680
open census and open tracing.

1084
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,840
They've become open telemetry.

1085
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,360
They were very clear when talking about it

1086
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,840
that they're not trying to provide an end to end solution,

1087
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,760
like some like APM monitoring tool.

1088
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,800
No, they just wanna provide the building blocks

1089
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,840
and that leaves a lot of room for businesses on top.

1090
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,600
Maybe that seems weird from the open source,

1091
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,320
but the results I think are that

1092
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,200
all these businesses feel comfortable

1093
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,040
sharing and working on the same lower end tool set.

1094
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,460
Well, because of that,

1095
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,080
they're all going open source by default.

1096
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,680
In fact, an observation you made

1097
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,320
while walking around the streets of Barcelona.

1098
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,840
One thing that's very apparent at KubeCon

1099
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,440
is that open source is front and center.

1100
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,600
In almost every product, whether it's a paid service or not,

1101
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,800
open source is one of the first words you hear.

1102
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,220
Now you get some interesting reactions

1103
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,680
when you start asking about the license,

1104
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,460
but several of those interactions

1105
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,400
end up being with one of the lead programmers

1106
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,160
or architects of the product.

1107
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,760
And usually they just pull up the GitHub page

1108
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,100
and show you the license directly.

1109
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,480
To be clear, many of these services

1110
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,000
are paid commercial offerings.

1111
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,560
Some are totally open source and provide support.

1112
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,560
Some are more of an open core model,

1113
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,480
although I'm not sure they would like to be called that.

1114
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,120
It is very apparent that this is a community

1115
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,200
focused on open source as a balancing layer.

1116
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,600
So I guess if you take nothing else away

1117
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,400
from all this talk about Kubernetes and containers

1118
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,200
and all of that is at the very high level,

1119
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,480
it is resulting in a ton of new open source code.

1120
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,360
Some of these little companies are gonna go away

1121
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,220
or get consolidated, but they're all still producing

1122
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,000
open source code that will be useful.

1123
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,760
Yeah, I think many of these companies,

1124
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,600
I went to a great talk by some Spotify employees

1125
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,260
talking about how they had reinvented

1126
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,240
so many of these cloud native projects internally.

1127
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,000
I think that happened to a lot of companies.

1128
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,560
Data centers were set up just enough differently

1129
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,880
that there wasn't this motivation

1130
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,080
for that shared internal coding and infrastructure.

1131
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,920
And as one outcome of the cloud is,

1132
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,840
everyone was using the same APIs

1133
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,120
and had sort of the same set of problems.

1134
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,320
So there became this base

1135
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,520
that you could easily build open source tools on top of.

1136
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,840
Everybody was super, super worried for a very long time

1137
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,800
that the cloud was gonna mean

1138
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,200
like all this really crazy vendor lock-in.

1139
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,160
And it still does, it still will for some people.

1140
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,120
But Kubernetes is sort of creating this common platform

1141
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,320
that is vendor neutral.

1142
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,520
And that's why I think it has so much excitement around it.

1143
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,400
Yeah, one of the things that was a big takeaway for me

1144
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,880
that this was the first time

1145
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,080
that I've been to any container event

1146
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,200
where we actually talked about the concept of in production.

1147
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,940
And one of the things that we kept joking around

1148
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,000
is like, yeah, Kubernetes,

1149
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,400
everyone's doing it in development,

1150
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,880
but who's doing it in production?

1151
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,760
And that was always the naysayer.

1152
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,840
And this was the first conference where companies are like,

1153
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,440
you know what, we're running thousand level nodes

1154
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,400
in production, here's our failover rate.

1155
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,060
It was actual information,

1156
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,380
actual statistics of companies doing it live.

1157
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,520
Real lessons learned in production.

1158
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,360
Yep.

1159
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,180
That is nice.

1160
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,020
Yeah, they're not there, right?

1161
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,320
I mean, it's usually the easy ones,

1162
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,520
but there is real stuff.

1163
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,360
It's getting there, right?

1164
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,200
The first workloads.

1165
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,800
They talk about reliability as one of the factors, right?

1166
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,600
So they are seen in those scenarios

1167
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,880
where it is well-developed and makes sense.

1168
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,720
Better results, you know,

1169
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,440
it's not just that it's lower maintenance or what,

1170
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,520
the applications are running better.

1171
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,640
Brian, that senior software engineer at VMware,

1172
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,560
I have a link in the show notes to his keynote.

1173
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,400
He also talks about

1174
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,600
what Kubernetes is not doing well right now.

1175
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,040
It's a bit of a hype buster keynote,

1176
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,320
but I really appreciate that.

1177
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,000
Yeah, I mean, so the keynotes were at times awkward,

1178
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,840
but the upside of that is I think a reason

1179
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,600
is it was mostly engineers, not business executives.

1180
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,080
Sure, there were like product managers and people,

1181
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,480
but these were mostly nerdy people

1182
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,200
directly involved in these products.

1183
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,640
Maybe they weren't coding anymore,

1184
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,260
but they'd been coding for years.

1185
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,000
Elle, did you get any step tracking?

1186
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,800
I would imagine you must've gotten.

1187
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,640
I did.

1188
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,920
I think we averaged about 20,000 a day,

1189
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,760
except for the day that we went to the after party

1190
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,040
and Wes says, we should just walk back to the hotel.

1191
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,320
And then we were almost at 30,000 steps

1192
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,560
because why look at the map before you leave?

1193
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,480
No regrets.

1194
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,040
Oh man, that's the only exercise I get

1195
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,520
is going to cover these events, so I shouldn't complain.

1196
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,440
We were in the same venue

1197
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,120
that they hold Mobile World Congress at,

1198
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,520
which that's way more attendees,

1199
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,000
and we weren't using all of it, just a little bit.

1200
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,400
It just meant that between,

1201
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,020
if you wanted to go look at all the sponsors

1202
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,960
being displayed out on the expo hall,

1203
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,180
and then you wanted to go to a talk,

1204
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,240
well, you have to walk literally between buildings.

1205
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,320
It's fenced off in a way,

1206
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,160
kind of like the Boston airport, you might say, Chris,

1207
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,800
where you just, there's no choice but to go the long way.

1208
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,640
Oh man.

1209
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,120
And the long way is like a 20 minute walk

1210
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,480
with actual escalator, you know,

1211
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,920
with like moving walkways like you find in an airport.

1212
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,440
Yeah, you should note that the only place

1213
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,400
that they had coffee located at the venue

1214
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,620
was next to the showcase showroom.

1215
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,320
So if you were at a talk and you wanted coffee,

1216
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,360
you had to make the walk all the way through.

1217
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,360
That's brutal.

1218
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,800
Well, I know we've got even more stories

1219
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,360
that we want to share in the Friday stream.

1220
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,560
And when we do that again,

1221
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,980
I'm looking forward to some of that.

1222
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:09,820
And I got a couple of things

1223
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,480
I think I might ask you in the post-show.

1224
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,780
We should probably keep going.

1225
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,600
Any other thoughts, Elle, before we wrap up?

1226
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,400
I think that we are going to see

1227
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,560
and bigger things coming out of Kubernetes.

1228
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,360
I almost hate to say that because I did want to be a person

1229
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,920
that say, you know, it's all hype,

1230
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,920
but I'm really changing my mind on that

1231
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,160
and really seeing what it can do for businesses.

1232
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,120
So you know that I work day in, day out with OpenShift,

1233
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,840
which is the Red Hat version of Kubernetes, if you like.

1234
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,560
And I agree that it's not hype.

1235
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,400
There are huge, huge companies using OpenShift

1236
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,200
to run their entire websites,

1237
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,800
shipping millions of parcels every day.

1238
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,920
You know, there are huge businesses using it.

1239
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,080
So it's not just hype.

1240
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,600
I know, and it's making a maturity transition now,

1241
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,400
which you, I think, pointed out pretty well in your clip

1242
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,240
about the fact that it's really, we're talking like 2018

1243
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,480
is when this thing kind of hit gold master status.

1244
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,360
So very good.

1245
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,280
Well done, you two.

1246
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,720
Thank you for going over there.

1247
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,080
How long was the flight?

1248
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,440
I mean, pretty long.

1249
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,640
I think I set the record getting back

1250
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,320
from leaving my hotel door to my apartment in Seattle,

1251
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,720
23 hours.

1252
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,440
I thought Elle would have set the record back

1253
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,880
since she had all those delays.

1254
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,320
He beat me by one hour.

1255
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,960
My God, you guys.

1256
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,960
Nearly 24 hours of traveling.

1257
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,280
It was pretty smooth for me.

1258
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,960
I got a little layover in Heathrow

1259
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,840
and then just a short little hop to Spain,

1260
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,840
but the way back was a bit more complicated.

1261
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,280
Next year, why don't you consider sending somebody

1262
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,520
from the JB crew you've already got in Europe, you know?

1263
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,320
Save the bodies.

1264
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,600
I think maybe they wanted to go, but I'm not sure.

1265
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,440
Or maybe.

1266
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,640
I'm even more impressed that TechSnap went out then.

1267
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,320
That's really something.

1268
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,920
Well, glad you guys are back

1269
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,680
and glad that the jet lag is beginning to fade.

1270
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,960
I did not have to go as far for my event.

1271
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,520
I was lucky enough to notice

1272
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,960
that the folks at Intel had launched a meetup

1273
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,960
to explain what they're doing with Clear Linux,

1274
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,320
and I was all about it.

1275
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,120
I really, I felt like I had not really been able

1276
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,480
to wrap my head around Clear Linux,

1277
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,320
and this was an opportunity to finally write that.

1278
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,920
Well, Intel campus number two for me this time

1279
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,200
at the Hawthorne Farm Campus,

1280
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,920
and it's just outside of Portland, Oregon,

1281
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,560
and they had an event all about Clear Linux,

1282
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,200
with an architecture overview,

1283
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,720
and then some demonstrations,

1284
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,120
and now they're actually doing a hands-on lab right now.

1285
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,680
They just also gave out dinner.

1286
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,200
And I wanted to step outside with Brent

1287
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,080
and kind of share our thoughts about the presentation,

1288
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,120
what they're kind of offering.

1289
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,920
Yeah, well, first, I think showing up

1290
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,080
to the campus was really special.

1291
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,920
It was really neat.

1292
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,160
The people were really nice here.

1293
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,320
Going into the actual auditorium to take in the presentation,

1294
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,240
for me being pretty visual, I thought, okay,

1295
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,720
there's, I don't know, maybe like 60 people in attendance

1296
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,360
or so, I think the meetup page at 63 or so.

1297
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,840
And then, but I felt, at least initially,

1298
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,560
it was quite technical right away.

1299
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,600
Really technical, and the people that were talking

1300
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,440
obviously knew some of what they were talking about,

1301
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,600
and with the focus on basically

1302
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,360
the update mechanism and security

1303
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,480
were what I saw as the overarching theme, really.

1304
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,440
Some concepts that they're doing sounds really great to me.

1305
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,360
I think a lot of distributions can put some

1306
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,040
of what they're talking about in play.

1307
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,400
But in other parts, I was a little underwhelmed.

1308
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,720
Like, they were fumbling a little bit

1309
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,240
in answering some of the questions from the crowd.

1310
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,160
So I just wondered, you know, they've been working on this,

1311
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,080
what, for four or five years now?

1312
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,240
And I just wondered why the push all of a sudden

1313
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,640
to push it out, and wondered,

1314
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,840
maybe it needs a bit more polish.

1315
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,120
But overall, I was impressed.

1316
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,640
Aha, so that's an interesting thing

1317
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,480
you picked up on there.

1318
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,600
So I asked about that.

1319
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,320
I said, why the push now?

1320
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,760
And the answer essentially came down to,

1321
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,120
for the last two years, we've really been cranking

1322
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,440
to make this thing good,

1323
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,240
and now we think we've gotten there.

1324
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:00,520
And so this is the first of what's going to be

1325
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,720
a quarterly kind of event that they're gonna hold

1326
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,600
to tell people about Clear Linux and do demonstrations.

1327
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,040
And they're refining it with this one.

1328
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,560
I mean, well, not even refining it,

1329
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,720
it's really 1.0, this whole thing.

1330
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,720
It's the first time some of these people

1331
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,360
have ever talked in front of people before.

1332
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,480
And so, yeah, sometimes they couldn't answer

1333
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,560
like the stateless question.

1334
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,680
They had a hard time explaining

1335
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,960
how Clear Linux did stateless versus other distributions.

1336
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,200
And then after some back and forth in the conversation,

1337
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,400
people were able to kind of grok that,

1338
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,240
essentially to Clear Linux, stateless means

1339
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,760
you can install the application

1340
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,440
and not have to configure its state.

1341
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,360
It's ready to go.

1342
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,680
Nothing has to be in slash Etsy at all.

1343
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,480
And you could delete slash Etsy

1344
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,480
and the applications will still start and run.

1345
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,120
That's what their version of stateless is.

1346
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,960
But that's not everybody's definition of stateless.

1347
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,640
And they didn't come out with a clear answer

1348
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,480
to that right away.

1349
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,640
And I think that's what you picked up on

1350
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,280
was one of those instances,

1351
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,880
and that is them working this out.

1352
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,760
But that message of we've been really working

1353
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,840
at this thing for two years,

1354
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,200
and now we're just gonna start talking about it like crazy.

1355
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,200
Like they're ramping up a whole messaging program

1356
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,080
around this.

1357
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,840
I think she said next month,

1358
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,680
I talked to Chris, one of their,

1359
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,840
she's one of their head open source community organizers.

1360
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,640
And she said that they're doing essentially

1361
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,120
this same presentation with this same crew,

1362
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,320
but they're gonna take another crack at it

1363
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,200
in California next month.

1364
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,320
I think maybe it's their strength is iteration.

1365
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,600
If you saw the version numbers on ClearOS,

1366
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,760
they're pretty high.

1367
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,080
They're very high.

1368
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,680
So maybe that's one of their strengths.

1369
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,600
I mean, a lot of these people are really technical.

1370
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,320
So iteration is a good way to push forward, right?

1371
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,240
So maybe this presentation, it's a first go.

1372
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,280
They're here, they're doing it smaller group.

1373
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,200
Maybe in California, they can have a bigger groups

1374
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,320
and practice and things like that.

1375
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,080
So maybe it's a good approach.

1376
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,520
Yeah, I'd be curious to circle back to this in a quarter

1377
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,400
and see what the presentation is like

1378
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,680
and see what they're talking about.

1379
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,520
And you know, I'll say this,

1380
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,120
I learned a few things in the presentation

1381
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,040
that I didn't quite understand before,

1382
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,320
about how they control versions, about how the updates,

1383
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,680
how bundles work.

1384
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,320
Like that was pretty good to wrap my head around.

1385
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,360
And I think it makes it worth the trip down here alone.

1386
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,560
But then to get the bigger picture

1387
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,480
where Intel is going with this,

1388
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,880
they're clearly trying to build something

1389
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,400
for the entire stack.

1390
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,440
So you have an OS that's optimized for your containers.

1391
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,560
You have an OS that's optimized for machine learning.

1392
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,480
You have OSs that are optimized for developer workstations.

1393
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,160
Because their whole approach is,

1394
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,760
you can use them as upstream

1395
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,160
and then bundle up and mix your own software

1396
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,440
and make it your own distribution

1397
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,520
with them as sort of a, a sort of upstream.

1398
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,200
It could be a compelling sell to some enterprises.

1399
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,360
So we'll see how they do.

1400
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,200
I'm glad we made it.

1401
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,640
You, are you glad you came down here?

1402
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,480
I'm definitely glad.

1403
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,320
I mean, it's been great to be more part of the community

1404
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,240
and having someone like Intel pushing something out,

1405
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,000
of course we're going to have to be here and cover it.

1406
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,320
I'm really glad we made it.

1407
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,840
And I would, like I said,

1408
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,880
I got an opportunity to better understand

1409
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,040
a couple of aspects of clear Linux.

1410
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,160
And I thought maybe I'd share

1411
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,040
a few of those insights with you.

1412
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,440
The thing I didn't really understand before was bundles.

1413
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,240
So I grabbed a little audio,

1414
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,800
the entire presentation where the audio is,

1415
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,920
the recording, the audio is actually much, much worse

1416
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,760
than what I'm about to play.

1417
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,600
Wow.

1418
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,280
It's like done over a phone line.

1419
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,400
So it's quite bad.

1420
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,120
But I have the link to the, to a video version

1421
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,960
and a link to the slides, if you want to know more,

1422
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,800
and if you want to see the slides

1423
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,200
to this guy's presentation.

1424
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,080
But here's a little, little tiny bit

1425
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,720
about what bundles are in clear Linux.

1426
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,720
So the idea behind, behind bundles is to simplify

1427
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,120
discovery installation of, of the software that you need

1428
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,440
to satisfy certain use cases.

1429
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,480
If you're familiar with the set of bundles

1430
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,440
that phones provide, right now there's around 900 or so.

1431
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,240
A lot of them, especially the ones that have been around

1432
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,080
for a long time are, are very use case focused.

1433
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,000
Some of them are providing, you know,

1434
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,520
like interpreters for various languages

1435
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,520
like Python two, Python three, et cetera.

1436
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,840
But others are a bit more use case focused

1437
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,400
like application server, cloud control.

1438
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,520
Some of the ones that I've, that are shown

1439
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,720
in the diagram on the right.

1440
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,960
Bundles are, you can kind of think of them

1441
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,040
as similar to package groups and other distros in a way.

1442
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,920
And they can be more work case specific.

1443
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,240
They can have a wider range of applications.

1444
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,380
Some of them are fairly complicated.

1445
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:15,760
And another aspect about packaging on clear Linux

1446
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,680
that is unique to clear Linux

1447
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,800
is when they resolve dependencies.

1448
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,600
It's not when you install a package.

1449
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,040
All dependencies are resolved at build time

1450
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,300
instead of at runtime, which is what you usually see

1451
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,040
with package managers and other distributions.

1452
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,120
The main motivation behind this is to keep things simple

1453
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,880
for what's running on the end user system.

1454
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,080
And also just to speed up update times

1455
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,280
is another motivation for that.

1456
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,280
It's kind of neat, huh?

1457
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,760
I like that they're rethinking some things

1458
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,640
about how you put together a Linux distribution.

1459
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,520
And we've seen that in other projects,

1460
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,960
but few with backers who have the resources of Intel, right?

1461
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,180
So they might actually get away with it

1462
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,760
if they can get enough stuff running on their system.

1463
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,640
And Brent, I don't know about you,

1464
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,720
but I had the sense that we were witnessing

1465
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,720
the beginning of something new for Intel.

1466
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,880
Yeah, I like that insight too.

1467
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,960
It felt like we were there at the start

1468
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,320
and that there were some small group people

1469
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,560
that are pretty jazzed about what they were doing.

1470
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,600
And we weren't the only ones trying to wrap our heads

1471
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,520
around everything they were doing.

1472
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,300
There was a lot of really insightful questions

1473
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,200
coming from the audience and some really good answers too.

1474
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:24,200
And they were also kind of upfront when they said,

1475
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,680
we're still learning about this too at the same time.

1476
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,520
So when we know more,

1477
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,520
we'll definitely communicate more about that.

1478
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,440
So it was kind of neat to see that back and forth happening

1479
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,440
between the audience and the clear OS team as well.

1480
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,240
Can I ask, it seems like we're,

1481
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,860
maybe skeptical is too strong of a word,

1482
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,240
but we're obviously very curious about

1483
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,040
why Intel's doing this, what are the motivations?

1484
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,560
It's funny, especially in the times, right?

1485
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,320
We've just lost Antegos

1486
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,280
and we've seen many small distributions die off.

1487
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,040
Should we just be kind of happy

1488
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,720
that there's a new player in the field?

1489
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,200
Yes, I think that is a default,

1490
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:01,600
but I think we're underestimating them.

1491
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,640
Part of what I got a better appreciation of

1492
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,820
over the last couple of years,

1493
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:07,600
because you remember it was not too long ago,

1494
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,120
I went to meet BSD, which was also at the Intel campus.

1495
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,840
And that's where I learned like the number of people

1496
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,380
in their open source division is over 100.

1497
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,040
Like we're talking...

1498
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,480
That's some significant staffing, yeah.

1499
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,120
Yeah, I mean, so they have some resources here

1500
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,200
and they've been really heads down

1501
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,960
for about two years on Clear Linux.

1502
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,540
And I think they're kind of getting to a point now

1503
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,560
where they're pretty proud of what they made

1504
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,120
because they've built a couple of different scenarios

1505
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,600
where you can see there's some clear advantages,

1506
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,400
ha ha ha, and they're able to tout those use cases.

1507
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,740
And it's compelling.

1508
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:46,020
In fact, they don't really talk about this very much,

1509
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:50,400
but even on AMD systems, you can see clear optimizations

1510
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,400
and benefits of using Clear Linux.

1511
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,960
Yeah, it's not just Intel.

1512
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,160
So they've done a good job with it.

1513
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,960
Yeah, it's really anything back to Haswell,

1514
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,960
and which is any modern CPU, it's gonna work great.

1515
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:06,160
And they have a very sharp community manager, Carrie,

1516
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,320
who I met.

1517
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,720
She's also, she's doing like...

1518
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,200
Do you remember the name of the podcast, Brent,

1519
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,120
that they're doing?

1520
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,840
Something like Open Source Voices.

1521
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,680
Or Clear Voices.

1522
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,360
Clear Voices, something like that.

1523
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,200
We'll have to find it.

1524
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,120
Yeah, I'm gonna talk to her more

1525
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,540
and see if maybe we can't be of assistance in some way.

1526
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:23,440
But she was really sharp and I think they have a good plan

1527
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,720
of how to try to get the word out there.

1528
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,400
They're not, they're just getting started.

1529
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:31,820
So I think our skepticism that we have today at mid-2019,

1530
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,560
at this time in 2020, will be gone.

1531
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,960
It'll be obvious what their value is, I think.

1532
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,320
And I think they're gonna do a good job explaining it.

1533
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,360
Well, I've got it running on my system,

1534
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,560
and maybe I'll just let it stick around for a while.

1535
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,520
What did you think of the install?

1536
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,320
Did you use the GUI installer or did you use the...

1537
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,720
I did use the GUI.

1538
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,600
What'd you think?

1539
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,560
For me, it was actually surprisingly smooth.

1540
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,200
Really? Yeah, I didn't mind it.

1541
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,520
And now you have GNOME?

1542
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,360
Or what, what'd you go with?

1543
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,960
I mean, I'm back in Plasma for the show.

1544
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,560
I wasn't ready to do Unplugged on that.

1545
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,920
Did you do it in a VM?

1546
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,800
I did it in a VM, but I booted into it as well.

1547
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,920
Did you K-exec into it?

1548
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,760
I mean, maybe.

1549
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,120
I can't believe you.

1550
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,960
Well, it's just the easiest way to try it out, okay?

1551
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,840
Okay, well, how come you don't show me how to do this?

1552
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,480
This is something I wanna know how you do.

1553
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,320
That I can do.

1554
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,520
So you're applying it, so you installed it via a VM,

1555
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,760
and then once it's a VM, you K-exec into it

1556
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,080
and run it like it's on your actual machine.

1557
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,680
Like, then at that point, it thinks it's running,

1558
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,800
I mean, it is running, your kernel switches over to it,

1559
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,640
right? Yeah, I mean,

1560
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,720
there's like a little overhead with the way

1561
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,720
the disk is set up right now.

1562
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:28,720
It doesn't have to be that way,

1563
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,440
but otherwise it works great.

1564
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,280
Okay, how does K-exec compare to like a Chirrut

1565
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,880
or an Alex C or something?

1566
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,800
The biggest difference is just that it's booting

1567
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,360
into a new kernel, basically.

1568
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,560
So you could do it with grub too.

1569
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:46,520
The K-exec part is just a little smoother or faster,

1570
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,480
I guess, you don't have to make a modification to your-

1571
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,920
The host OS just goes away?

1572
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,720
Is it like just pulling the power point?

1573
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,400
It like loads the new kernel in memory

1574
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,600
and then jumps to the new kernel.

1575
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,200
So as far as like the processes are concerned,

1576
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,800
you've just pulled the power on your machine?

1577
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,840
Yes, System D has a nice command option,

1578
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,960
so it will do all the shutdown stuff,

1579
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,320
and at the very end, instead of like issuing a halt,

1580
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,360
it'll do a K-exec.

1581
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,720
This has been built with a kernel for a while now.

1582
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,400
Yeah, there's a whole bootloader based around

1583
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,520
just using it, right?

1584
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,560
It's such a great, this is between that

1585
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,040
and hardware pass-through with my virtual machines,

1586
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,440
I just feel like I could make it an entire release cycle

1587
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,840
without having to repartition.

1588
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,560
I could try out different distros

1589
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,840
with full hardware support.

1590
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,560
Clear Linux though, as a workstation,

1591
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,360
that I feel like I would want to give a go

1592
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,720
on physical hardware for a while.

1593
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,320
It's to me, it's a clear winner on the server

1594
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,200
and as a container platform,

1595
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,320
depending on what your different workloads are,

1596
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,440
what your requirements are.

1597
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,240
But as the workstation OS, maybe.

1598
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,520
I mean, they do have support for Flatpak,

1599
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,200
so that does open the door to a lot of apps.

1600
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,600
That's what I'm curious about is, you know,

1601
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,720
how well they've changed the idea, right?

1602
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,600
They've gone from packages to bundles.

1603
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,680
How well does that play out?

1604
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,760
And I'm not sure on a server I wouldn't,

1605
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,840
I might not interact with that as much as I would

1606
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,680
on a desktop.

1607
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,520
And it's a rolling release distro to the extreme.

1608
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,400
Like they sometimes have three releases in a day.

1609
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,520
Woo.

1610
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,760
Yeah.

1611
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,240
And what's crazy is there's a way to build

1612
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,280
every version they've ever released

1613
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,520
and they keep on their server the source code

1614
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:21,500
and compiled versions of every version

1615
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,720
they've ever released, every branch.

1616
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,440
You remember what their version number that they're at now?

1617
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,240
It's something like in the thousands,

1618
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,000
like maybe the multiples of thousands.

1619
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,720
Yeah, they iterate on tens, if I remember correctly.

1620
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:35,720
So, but the number was at like 2,500,

1621
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,600
something like that.

1622
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,520
It was ridiculous.

1623
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,680
Yeah, and so they keep a copy on their servers

1624
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,000
and they were just moving around cloud providers

1625
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,360
and they say when they apply aggressive deduplication,

1626
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:52,480
the whole ClearLinux source stack is about 16 terabytes.

1627
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,240
But if they don't apply aggressive dedupe,

1628
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,520
do you have a guess?

1629
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,360
You have a guess what it would be?

1630
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,520
100 terabytes?

1631
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,560
Very close, 76 terabytes.

1632
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,000
Yeah, 76.

1633
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,120
So they said, we might not do this forever.

1634
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,960
We might not keep every build forever.

1635
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,160
Giant, immutable storage of all packages.

1636
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,440
I would love to know how big the Ubuntu package archives are

1637
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,840
just for comparison.

1638
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,920
I wonder, you figure ClearLinux has been around

1639
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,480
for a couple of years and it's that large.

1640
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,720
I can't do that forever.

1641
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,560
They are Intel though.

1642
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,480
Right, but they're moving fast,

1643
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,080
so generating lots of versions.

1644
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,120
Yeah, yeah, it looks like, I think it's a,

1645
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:31,520
I feel like it is a Linux distribution

1646
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,440
that deserves to be here.

1647
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,720
All right, so when do you think we're gonna see

1648
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,040
the first distro based on ClearLinux?

1649
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,080
Oh, hmm.

1650
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,160
But you know, with its own branding and website.

1651
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,320
It seems like that'd be pretty doable

1652
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,520
because they have this whole mix system

1653
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,400
where you can mix your own ClearLinux

1654
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,720
that has like stuff pre-built in and ready to go

1655
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,520
that's still based on their upstream stuff.

1656
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:57,280
So it's almost like a distro re-spinners dream in a way.

1657
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,960
They've already thought of that and made it easy for you.

1658
01:00:58,960 --> 01:00:59,960
Yeah, yeah.

1659
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,080
Or does that just mean that they won't need it as much

1660
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:03,920
because you can do it yourself?

1661
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,800
Have you thought of a date?

1662
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,120
Have you thought of a timeline?

1663
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,760
Because I had, you know, you just sprung this up.

1664
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,920
No, I just think of that might be a sign of a success

1665
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,440
at some point.

1666
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,640
So the numbers are in.

1667
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:16,640
Pixel Geek from the IRC says the version number current

1668
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,240
is 29,660.

1669
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,080
How about that?

1670
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:24,920
That's their version number.

1671
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:25,760
Go, baby, go.

1672
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,440
29,000.

1673
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,280
Version 29,000.

1674
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,640
Take that, Chrome.

1675
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,640
Wow, yeah.

1676
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,320
I just missed a decimal point.

1677
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,160
No big deal.

1678
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,760
Oh, yeah.

1679
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,040
Jeez.

1680
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,200
Well, anyways, you're right.

1681
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,480
Anyways, it was a cool insight,

1682
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,600
and I feel like I understand them a lot better now.

1683
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,920
And I'm kind of rooting for them.

1684
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,360
Are they going to do more of these events?

1685
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,560
Yeah, frequently.

1686
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,920
In fact, I think next month they have one in California

1687
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:51,760
or something like that,

1688
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,440
and then they're going to try to do one.

1689
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,000
I think they're at the campus like nearly every quarter.

1690
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:56,840
They're important.

1691
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,360
Wow, that's a lot of outreach.

1692
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,280
Yeah, it is.

1693
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,120
It is.

1694
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,720
They did a catered dinner too.

1695
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,240
Wow, first class.

1696
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,360
They really had a nice setup.

1697
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,120
You get there and it's structured beautifully.

1698
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:10,240
You start with a architecture overview

1699
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,040
that was really well presented by,

1700
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,240
I believe his name was Patrick McCarty.

1701
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,880
And he did a great job of going through

1702
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,960
the overall architecture of it.

1703
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,640
Then you got a couple of use case demos.

1704
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,320
So they did some onstage demos

1705
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,080
of how Clear Linux can be kind of handy.

1706
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,240
And they were legit demos.

1707
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,400
Then you break for dinner,

1708
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,880
and then you come back and it's hands-on.

1709
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,720
You set up Clear Linux,

1710
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,560
you go through some scenarios

1711
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,280
with the engineers in the room there.

1712
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,440
And you just bug them for any questions or tips.

1713
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,920
Yeah, and the Intel campus is,

1714
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,000
they have auditoriums.

1715
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,320
In fact, I encourage everyone

1716
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,800
to go check out the blog posts for,

1717
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,680
don't call it a blog.

1718
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,640
They're really articles.

1719
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,320
They're not blogs, they're articles.

1720
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:53,320
For both Wes and Elle's trip to Barcelona,

1721
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,080
and Brent and my trip to Portland,

1722
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:59,480
they're both beautifully visualized.

1723
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,680
What's the word I'm looking for?

1724
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,200
Come on, Wes, help me out, great photos.

1725
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,320
You guys, did you take that photo of Elle?

1726
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,160
Yeah.

1727
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,000
That's a great photo.

1728
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,960
Yeah, that worked out really nicely.

1729
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,040
I mean, and you know.

1730
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:08,880
Elle, I'm just saying.

1731
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:09,720
Working with a good subject, too.

1732
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,560
That photo, that photo that Wes took of you

1733
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:14,600
would make like a good Twitter banner, you know?

1734
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,440
It's a little scary,

1735
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,920
because I never saw him take them.

1736
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:20,040
That's always the best ones.

1737
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,120
Those are always the best photos.

1738
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,280
In your element.

1739
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,880
Yeah, and you can see me being a goof.

1740
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,760
In your element.

1741
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,720
A hint of some of my big news.

1742
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,800
Those are both posted.

1743
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,520
Brent wrote up the trip to Portland,

1744
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,840
and Elle wrote up the trip to Kubicon.

1745
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,120
And they're both posted.

1746
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,480
Now, they're in the show notes.

1747
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,960
But if you would like to just go over there,

1748
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,640
if you click on the little blog link,

1749
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,480
I don't know why they call it that,

1750
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,320
because they're articles.

1751
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,280
Articles. Obviously, obviously.

1752
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,760
Or you go to linuxonplug.com slash articles,

1753
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:49,640
then you'll see them.

1754
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,920
And many others, like my factory tour of system memory

1755
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:52,760
went to systems.

1756
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:53,600
That was a lot of fun.

1757
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,600
It's on there, too.

1758
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,800
Great write up, both of you.

1759
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,000
Elle and Brent, you guys.

1760
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:57,840
Thank you, guys.

1761
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,640
Yeah, yeah, and Cheese's previous write ups

1762
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,560
about LinuxFest are on there.

1763
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,640
So go check that out.

1764
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,360
We don't talk about it very much,

1765
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:06,040
but this is an audio podcast,

1766
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,520
and there's some great visuals right there on the blog.

1767
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:12,320
So you can go check it out all over at linuxonplug.com.

1768
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,440
And while you're over there,

1769
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,720
go to linuxonplug.com slash contact,

1770
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:16,960
and send us your feedback.

1771
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,160
Of course, we've got this wonderful virtual lug,

1772
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,040
but not everybody can make it on a 2 p.m.

1773
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,480
We get it, it's a hard time.

1774
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,520
Tuesdays are workdays.

1775
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,280
And 2 p.m. is, that's Pacific time.

1776
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,840
Who's, we're at the end of the world over here.

1777
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,680
Who's in Pacific time, right?

1778
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,240
Yeah, so I totally get it.

1779
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,040
So let us know what you think.

1780
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,800
Go to linuxonplug.com slash contact,

1781
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,520
and also linuxonplug.reddit.com.

1782
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,440
We monitor both those and Telegram,

1783
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,520
jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

1784
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,560
Now the show is live.

1785
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,000
I'll be doing it from Texas next week.

1786
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,160
We'll see how that goes.

1787
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,560
Thanks so much for tuning in.

1788
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,120
See you back here next Tuesday.

1789
01:04:53,120 --> 01:05:08,120
I'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1790
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:31,440
So the one thing that we didn't talk about in the show,

1791
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,600
because it'd be completely inappropriate,

1792
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,200
but I'm curious to hear your take and Elle's take

1793
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,120
on how the press aspect of Kubicon was.

1794
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,400
Did they have a media room?

1795
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,000
Was there media food and all that kind of stuff?

1796
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,600
Yes, there was a media room,

1797
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,640
and they had a little area for quiet meetings.

1798
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:48,720
I actually saw some pictures,

1799
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,160
I guess someone had recorded,

1800
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,400
but looked like a podcast in there.

1801
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,320
Although the room was way too reflective for my taste.

1802
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,160
We avoided it.

1803
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,760
But they had space to sit and access to power chargers

1804
01:05:58,760 --> 01:05:59,600
and that sort of thing.

1805
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,420
What did you think?

1806
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:01,960
How did it stack up compared to other events, Elle?

1807
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,720
Yeah, the room was pretty barren.

1808
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,540
I would say that they were just kind of like,

1809
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:08,040
here's the extra leftover room that we had.

1810
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,880
And I love that Wes says that they had access to power

1811
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,680
chargers and adapters because we couldn't use them.

1812
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:18,200
We forgot that not everyone runs the same way the US does.

1813
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,560
Oh, I want to hear all about that.

1814
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,160
We got to tell that story in the Friday stream.

1815
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,360
So I would say it was definitely,

1816
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,200
they had some stuff,

1817
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,860
so we got to see Jim Zemlin basically fawn over Google

1818
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,560
and just thank them over and over

1819
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,220
for giving the world Kubernetes.

1820
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,720
So they had some people and they had like a little panel

1821
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,720
we got to see, but that was it.

1822
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,840
It was like kind of media stuff on one day

1823
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,640
in a little room with terrible audio.

1824
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:40,920
They couldn't hear any of the questions

1825
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:41,760
coming back at them.

1826
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,960
So nowhere near as good as the Red Hat Summit.

1827
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,400
Ah, interesting.

1828
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,560
How was the food?

1829
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,920
Well, it was all right.

1830
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,400
Elle had some misadventures in food

1831
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,920
because the her and the Barcelona tastes

1832
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:54,920
just don't really align.

1833
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:55,760
That's another Friday stream.

1834
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,000
Yeah, we'll talk more about it on Friday.

1835
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,840
I can't.

1836
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,440
Oh, Elle lost six pounds.

1837
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,280
That's right.

1838
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,360
Oh, no.

1839
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,600
Well, that's just because Wes has you walking everywhere.

1840
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,480
He did the same thing at Red Hat Summit.

1841
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,600
Now, we did do our best to try to like

1842
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,920
eat all of Amazon's money.

1843
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,920
They had one of the after parties we went to.

1844
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,280
So those snacks were pretty good.

1845
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,720
Were the parties all right?

1846
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:16,720
I drug him to every single party, I think.

1847
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,000
Attagirl, good for you.

1848
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,080
Did he complain, Elle, or was he a trooper?

1849
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,280
No, I think he made friends with my friends, so.

1850
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,600
That's Wes for you.

1851
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,560
You have nice friends.

1852
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,400
You know what?

1853
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,840
It's like that's one of the great things

1854
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,440
about hanging out with Brent, too.

1855
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,240
Wes and Brent, same way, it's like,

1856
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,640
you guys are pretty much down for anything.

1857
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,040
Except we hate each other for some reason.

1858
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:36,840
Yeah, right.

1859
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,960
Nice.

1860
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,560
Brent, I had such a great time.

1861
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,040
Again, I'm just so glad we did that.

1862
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,600
You know, Brent's down for whatever you want to do.

1863
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,640
Like, you want to sit around and watch some YouTube,

1864
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,760
Brent's good with that.

1865
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,480
You want to go take a crazy ass road trip to some coastal town

1866
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,040
so that way you can get tacos, Brent's good with that.

1867
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,280
You want to get pulled over?

1868
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,320
Sure.

1869
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,720
Oh, yeah.

1870
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,440
Oh, my story about getting pulled over

1871
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,400
with Brent in the car, totally embarrassing,

1872
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,000
in episode five of the Friday stream.

1873
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,480
Were those prawn tacos?

1874
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,400
Yeah, they were.

1875
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,360
They were prawn tacos.

1876
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,040
Have I told you about prawns?

1877
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,160
I'd like to take a moment and tell you about prawns.

1878
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:11,640
Oh, my.

1879
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,320
Oh, my.

1880
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,320
It's something we're working on.

1881
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,480
I don't want to tell you now.

1882
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,640
But I'm very excited about a new prawn opportunity.

1883
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,800
Project prawn?

1884
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,640
We'll get there.

1885
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:19,240
You'll see.

1886
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:46,800
You'll see.
