00:00.000 --> 00:22.240
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's phoning it in for the holidays.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.240
My name is Chris.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.240
My name is Wes.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.240
Oh, I tease.

00:25.240 --> 00:26.880
Actually, Wes, I'm pretty excited about today's episode.

00:26.880 --> 00:27.880
You should be.

00:27.880 --> 00:28.880
Thank you.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.480
We have some good stuff lined up.

00:30.480 --> 00:33.640
We're going to do a retrospective of some of the more relevant topics we covered this

00:33.640 --> 00:34.640
year.

00:34.640 --> 00:38.440
Like I was teasing previously on the pre-show, this is the episode that makes everybody sound

00:38.440 --> 00:39.440
really smart.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.320
I just take their best bits and we throw it into this week's episode.

00:42.320 --> 00:43.320
Because they're awesome.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.320
We love our audience.

00:44.320 --> 00:47.340
Yeah, and then when we come back on the week after Christmas, we're going to look back

00:47.340 --> 00:50.880
at some of these topics and we're going to look forward to 2016 as well.

00:50.880 --> 00:54.120
So I think we have a pretty good show lined up, so stick with us for our special holiday

00:54.120 --> 00:59.320
episode here on the Linux Unplugged program that we have created and crafted just for

00:59.320 --> 01:00.320
you.

01:00.320 --> 01:03.080
If you've never listened to Linux Unplugged before or if you've been listening for the

01:03.080 --> 01:08.520
entire 2015 year, there is something in this week's episode of the show.

01:08.520 --> 01:09.520
So thank you very much for tuning in.

01:09.520 --> 01:13.800
And while we're still in the intro, let's bring in that Mumble Room.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.080
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

01:16.080 --> 01:17.080
Hello.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.080
Happy holidays.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.080
Happy holidays.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.080
Happy holidays.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.080
Happy holidays, guys.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.080
Thank you for joining us.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.280
So we got something that came in on the mail.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.440
Came in, knock, knock on the door.

01:26.440 --> 01:31.960
Before we started the show, we got a brand new package that came in and we thought, what

01:31.960 --> 01:32.960
the heck is it?

01:32.960 --> 01:34.320
Was it a Christmas gift?

01:34.320 --> 01:35.800
Was it a Kwanzaa gift?

01:35.800 --> 01:36.800
Surprise.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.960
And I started, it's funny, the box actually said, tear it open.

01:40.960 --> 01:42.160
That's what the box says on the front of it.

01:42.160 --> 01:43.160
Tear into it.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.640
And I'm like, well, that's a challenge.

01:44.640 --> 01:45.640
All right.

01:45.640 --> 01:46.640
Yes, it is.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.640
So I began to rip the box open.

01:47.640 --> 01:51.720
I pulled it out and something very orange emerged from that box.

01:51.720 --> 02:04.000
I think it's called the Kano and we're going to talk about this.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.040
So the Kano appears to be a computer kit built for kids.

02:08.040 --> 02:11.280
It has a Raspberry Pi as its brain.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.760
And Wes, we have it right here in studio.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.040
And I was thinking, you know, it comes with this keyboard.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.160
It comes with this nice acrylic case.

02:18.160 --> 02:19.160
It's got a touchpad.

02:19.160 --> 02:21.120
It's got all the cables you need.

02:21.120 --> 02:25.760
This is like, if you wanted to give a Raspberry Pi to a kid, it comes with the stickers.

02:25.760 --> 02:30.600
Like this is legitimate, like very compelling for a kid and the packaging is like Christmas

02:30.600 --> 02:31.600
ready.

02:31.600 --> 02:32.600
I mean, it's all you could ask for.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.240
This is a kid for like a cool, fun, tech gift.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.600
Seriously, this is like a Raspberry Pi for the holidays.

02:37.600 --> 02:41.480
It comes with a speaker so you can make it a podcast player or an MP3 player.

02:41.480 --> 02:44.960
My parents have Windows 10 on the desktop, but I want my own system.

02:44.960 --> 02:50.280
It comes, look at this, comes with the HDMI out, comes with the USB wireless keyboard with

02:50.280 --> 02:51.280
a touchpad.

02:51.280 --> 02:52.280
Yeah.

02:52.280 --> 02:53.280
It's got the wire there too.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.280
Look at this thing.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.280
Dang, son.

02:55.280 --> 02:56.280
I know.

02:56.280 --> 02:57.280
This is a...

02:57.280 --> 02:58.280
And the Rubik's cube?

02:58.280 --> 02:59.280
Does it come with that?

02:59.280 --> 03:00.280
All right.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.280
All right, Wes.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.280
So here's the challenge.

03:02.280 --> 03:05.680
I want you to open this thing on the show live and give us your impressions of it, but

03:05.680 --> 03:08.440
don't ruin it in case I want to give it to my kids.

03:08.440 --> 03:09.440
They don't listen, right?

03:09.440 --> 03:10.440
To none of your shows, I would hope.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.440
No, not yet at least.

03:11.440 --> 03:12.440
Not yet.

03:12.440 --> 03:13.440
Maybe one day.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.560
So yeah, it looks like a pretty nice box and oh, look at this.

03:16.560 --> 03:19.240
The box actually has an illustration on it.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.240
It's beautiful.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.320
It's got the Raspberry Pi laid out.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.480
This is a really nicely done packaging for this thing.

03:25.480 --> 03:26.960
Oh, look at that.

03:26.960 --> 03:27.960
Okay.

03:27.960 --> 03:28.960
All right.

03:28.960 --> 03:29.960
It's a little nicer than I expected.

03:29.960 --> 03:30.960
Do you need anything to cut?

03:30.960 --> 03:31.960
Do you need a...

03:31.960 --> 03:32.960
I do.

03:32.960 --> 03:33.960
You got keys on you, Wes?

03:33.960 --> 03:34.960
No, you took your keys out of your pocket.

03:34.960 --> 03:35.960
I took my keys out.

03:35.960 --> 03:36.960
Wes!

03:36.960 --> 03:37.960
I'm an amateur.

03:37.960 --> 03:38.960
Use this pen.

03:38.960 --> 03:39.960
Use this pen.

03:39.960 --> 03:40.960
I could probably cut it with the Onion Omega over here.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.880
Don't use the Onion Omega, Wes.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.440
Don't use the Onion Omega.

03:44.440 --> 03:46.680
This is really something.

03:46.680 --> 03:49.960
And their website is us.kano.me.

03:49.960 --> 03:50.960
There we go.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.560
That is a premium lid.

03:52.560 --> 03:53.560
Wow.

03:53.560 --> 03:55.400
I wish we had the camera on for this episode.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.600
It is...

03:56.600 --> 03:57.800
I don't know how to describe this.

03:57.800 --> 03:58.800
Wes is...

03:58.800 --> 03:59.800
The smell?

03:59.800 --> 04:00.800
Sublime.

04:00.800 --> 04:01.800
Let me see.

04:01.800 --> 04:02.800
Yeah, that does smell good.

04:02.800 --> 04:03.800
So you open it up.

04:03.800 --> 04:09.300
It has a pouch on the roof of packets with a one, two, and then underneath it, it has...

04:09.300 --> 04:10.300
And this is all premium.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.800
I mean, it's like nice, heavy, matte cardstock.

04:12.800 --> 04:13.800
Yeah.

04:13.800 --> 04:14.800
Then down here, look at this poster.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.840
That is super gloss.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.960
They have like a thick poster paper here.

04:18.960 --> 04:19.960
Nice foam insert.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.960
It says, keep this card.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.240
You've built your computer.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.680
Oh my God.

04:25.680 --> 04:26.680
Okay.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.720
This keyboard is amazing.

04:28.720 --> 04:29.720
This is...

04:29.720 --> 04:31.320
The keyboard is bright orange.

04:31.320 --> 04:32.320
It's wireless.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.720
It has a built-in trackpad.

04:34.720 --> 04:35.720
It is...

04:35.720 --> 04:37.300
It feels...

04:37.300 --> 04:38.800
This is really well done.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.040
I want that keyboard for just my own use.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.000
Look at that Raspberry Pi.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.560
Look at that in there.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.560
That is...

04:45.560 --> 04:46.800
This is...

04:46.800 --> 04:48.200
This is super neat.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.960
This is really well done.

04:49.960 --> 04:50.960
So here's the keyboard.

04:50.960 --> 04:51.960
Here's...

04:51.960 --> 04:52.960
It's got an HDMI cable.

04:52.960 --> 04:53.960
What's this right here, Wes?

04:53.960 --> 04:54.960
Is that just USB there?

04:54.960 --> 04:55.960
That is a...

04:55.960 --> 04:56.960
For charging?

04:56.960 --> 04:57.960
Yep.

04:57.960 --> 04:58.960
USB, micro USB.

04:58.960 --> 04:59.960
And then here's the speaker you can add on right there, which looks really nice.

04:59.960 --> 05:00.960
And what do you have there?

05:00.960 --> 05:01.960
What is that red...

05:01.960 --> 05:02.960
I don't know.

05:02.960 --> 05:03.960
Oh.

05:03.960 --> 05:04.960
Is that a power adapter?

05:04.960 --> 05:05.960
Oh, yeah.

05:05.960 --> 05:06.960
It's a power adapter.

05:06.960 --> 05:07.960
Sure.

05:07.960 --> 05:08.960
Sure.

05:08.960 --> 05:09.960
Sure.

05:09.960 --> 05:10.960
Yeah.

05:10.960 --> 05:11.960
So you can power the Raspberry Pi.

05:11.960 --> 05:12.960
So this is everything you need about the screen to make the Raspberry Pi a full-fledged computer.

05:12.960 --> 05:13.960
Oh, and it comes with here a US adapter.

05:13.960 --> 05:14.960
Yeah.

05:14.960 --> 05:15.960
The suitable power adapter for yours.

05:15.960 --> 05:20.000
So if you have a display that works with HDMI, this is everything you need.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Which is what?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Just about everything these days.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.880
This is literally everything you need to make the Raspberry Pi a full-fledged computer.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.960
And then you put Ubuntu Mate on there and you're good to go.

05:27.960 --> 05:28.960
Right?

05:28.960 --> 05:29.960
I mean, and this is like a whole sandbox.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.720
You can let your kid, your teen, like whatever, right?

05:32.720 --> 05:33.720
You.

05:33.720 --> 05:34.720
You can have a whole separate thing.

05:34.720 --> 05:35.720
You don't break it.

05:35.720 --> 05:36.720
This is...

05:36.720 --> 05:37.720
Look at this keyboard.

05:37.720 --> 05:38.720
I mean, this is...

05:38.720 --> 05:40.760
That right there is really something.

05:40.760 --> 05:44.400
So they sent this into the studio and this is remarkable.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.400
Yeah.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.080
Wes is smelling right now.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.720
It has that new computer smell, right?

05:48.720 --> 05:49.760
I love it.

05:49.760 --> 05:50.760
So it's Kano.

05:50.760 --> 05:51.860
The trackpad feels really nice.

05:51.860 --> 05:53.000
It comes with really easy books.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
I think this is gonna...

05:54.000 --> 05:56.760
I think this is gonna go under the Christmas tree this year.

05:56.760 --> 05:57.840
That is really cool.

05:57.840 --> 06:01.440
And you know, just a couple episodes ago, we were talking about these small computers.

06:01.440 --> 06:06.280
Wimby, you might have yourself a whole bunch of Ubuntu Mate computers under the Christmas

06:06.280 --> 06:07.960
tree this year if this takes off.

06:07.960 --> 06:08.960
This is really impressive.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.960
Is there an SD card in there, too?

06:11.960 --> 06:12.960
Yeah.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.920
Are they Pi 1s or Pi 2s?

06:14.920 --> 06:16.760
I think it's a Pi 1, but I don't know.

06:16.760 --> 06:17.760
Oh, no.

06:17.760 --> 06:18.760
I take it back.

06:18.760 --> 06:19.760
No.

06:19.760 --> 06:20.760
No.

06:20.760 --> 06:21.760
It is a Raspberry Pi 2.

06:21.760 --> 06:22.760
Excellent.

06:22.760 --> 06:25.880
It is a Raspberry Pi 2 and it comes with an SD card with the Kano...

06:25.880 --> 06:26.880
Look, it's a branded SD card.

06:26.880 --> 06:27.880
Ooh.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.840
With a cute guy with a nice little, like, bowl cut.

06:29.840 --> 06:30.840
Yeah.

06:30.840 --> 06:31.840
It's a nice...

06:31.840 --> 06:32.840
Like, it's not like a...

06:32.840 --> 06:33.840
Wait a minute, Wes.

06:33.840 --> 06:34.840
Look at that.

06:34.840 --> 06:35.840
It has micro SD in there.

06:35.840 --> 06:36.840
Pull that micro SD out.

06:36.840 --> 06:37.840
How big is that micro SD storage there?

06:37.840 --> 06:40.560
What does it say?

06:40.560 --> 06:41.560
Can you see the space on there?

06:41.560 --> 06:42.560
SanDisk.

06:42.560 --> 06:43.560
Do you see the space on there?

06:43.560 --> 06:44.560
Eight gigs.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.480
So it comes with an eight gig micro SD card.

06:46.480 --> 06:50.760
You know, if you already have, let's say, 64 gigabyte for your camera, et cetera, you

06:50.760 --> 06:51.760
just give that to your kid.

06:51.760 --> 06:52.760
He has a full thing.

06:52.760 --> 06:53.760
Holy crap.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.200
Oh, we should take a picture of that.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.960
That is a cute SD card adapter.

06:56.960 --> 06:57.960
Yeah.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.960
They really put all the final nice touches on this.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.400
The keyboard is very high quality.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.400
The acrylic case is really, really nice.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.400
It's really strong.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.080
It includes a USB wireless dongle.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.760
Look at this tiny USB wireless dongle.

07:10.760 --> 07:11.760
Whoa.

07:11.760 --> 07:12.760
Look at that.

07:12.760 --> 07:13.840
It includes that too.

07:13.840 --> 07:14.840
This is remarkable.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.040
This is going under the Christmas tree.

07:16.040 --> 07:18.060
This is really something, which is great.

07:18.060 --> 07:19.060
This is just great.

07:19.060 --> 07:22.740
And this seems like such a good gift for someone like you're an aunt or an uncle, and maybe

07:22.740 --> 07:26.280
you don't see this kid so much, but you know that they're kind of interested in this area.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.400
You don't have time to maybe spend with them all the time, but you just want to set them

07:29.400 --> 07:30.400
on the right path.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.920
That is really neat.

07:31.920 --> 07:32.920
That is something.

07:32.920 --> 07:33.920
Huh.

07:33.920 --> 07:34.920
But yeah.

07:34.920 --> 07:35.920
There you go.

07:35.920 --> 07:36.920
That's pretty neat.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.040
And we just a little live unboxing right here on the Unplugged show.

07:39.040 --> 07:43.880
You know, guys, one of the things that was a big topic this year that was something that

07:43.880 --> 07:47.600
was fun, we talked about it as a here is a crowdfunding project.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.760
It started as like I think it was Indiegogo, I don't recall.

07:50.760 --> 07:57.640
It starts as an Indiegogo, becomes a key point to developing applications for the GNOME desktop.

07:57.640 --> 08:02.920
The guy gets a job at Red Hat now, and now it's part of like the XGD app spec to make

08:02.920 --> 08:04.960
portable applications for the Linux desktop.

08:04.960 --> 08:11.160
I'm talking about GNOME Builder, and we discussed GNOME Builder on episode 76 of the Unplugged

08:11.160 --> 08:12.160
program.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.400
Matt, I'm going to try giving a guest a call.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.400
Let's see if...

08:15.400 --> 08:16.400
All right.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.400
Hey, Christian, can you hear us?

08:17.400 --> 08:18.400
Yeah, I can hear you.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.400
Can you hear me?

08:19.400 --> 08:20.400
Yeah, we hear you great.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.400
Sure can.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.400
Thanks for coming on the show.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.400
So Matt, this is Christian.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.400
He's working on GNOME Builder.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.400
Awesome.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.400
And you're probably familiar.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.400
We've talked about the Indiegogo project that's going on.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.840
Christian, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

08:28.840 --> 08:29.840
Thanks.

08:29.840 --> 08:30.840
Thanks for having me.

08:30.840 --> 08:31.840
Oh, no, no problem.

08:31.840 --> 08:35.400
Congratulations, by the way, on the success of the GNOME Builder project.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.680
That seems like that Indiegogo has probably gone better than you expected, I would imagine.

08:39.680 --> 08:40.680
Yeah.

08:40.680 --> 08:43.440
I mean, significantly better than I expected.

08:43.440 --> 08:50.520
I tried to set some pretty ambitious goals, but at a very, very reasonable price point.

08:50.520 --> 08:56.120
And I'm hoping that people saw that and really came out to help.

08:56.120 --> 09:00.780
Well, what struck me about it is you seem like maybe you're a crazy person because you

09:00.780 --> 09:03.640
quit your full-time job to do this.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.640
Why take that risk?

09:04.640 --> 09:07.280
And you did that even before you launched the fundraiser.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.280
Yeah.

09:08.280 --> 09:13.400
You know, I've been a part of the free software community for a long time.

09:13.400 --> 09:20.600
And at some point, I decided that fixing the tools that we're all using is far more important

09:20.600 --> 09:23.960
than individual career growth to me.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.120
So I had a pretty kickass job, too.

09:26.120 --> 09:28.680
I was working at MongoDB, working on their C driver.

09:28.680 --> 09:31.160
And it's a great group of people there.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.680
They really care about free software.

09:32.680 --> 09:35.400
There's a reason why the products say GPL licensed.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.480
But ultimately, this was the most important thing I could be doing.

09:38.480 --> 09:41.320
So I really had to make the switch.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.940
That's very impressive and very admirable.

09:44.940 --> 09:50.520
So when you launched the fundraiser, has the scope of what GNOME Builder is going to include

09:50.520 --> 09:54.000
expanded quite a bit since the funding kicked in?

09:54.000 --> 09:59.560
Well, you know, it really determines how much and for how long people are willing to support

09:59.560 --> 10:00.560
me.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.600
Like, yes, I want all of these features in there.

10:03.600 --> 10:08.440
You know, I knew that for me to be able to be successful with this, the most important

10:08.440 --> 10:11.860
thing I can do is build Builder with Builder.

10:11.860 --> 10:17.240
So that meant the first priority is C. And so we need C. Builder has to be written in

10:17.240 --> 10:19.100
C for technical reasons.

10:19.100 --> 10:21.160
We want to reuse as much of the software as we can.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.160
We want to reuse Glade.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.160
We want to reuse Dev Help.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.120
We want to reuse Git G, GTK Source View.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.960
And all these things are best integrated from C.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.840
So that didn't mean that we don't want to support VALA, you know.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.280
It doesn't mean we don't want to support Python or JavaScript or any of these other languages

10:36.280 --> 10:37.960
in a first-class way.

10:37.960 --> 10:41.320
It just means that, like, our priority had to be this first.

10:41.320 --> 10:45.080
So I knew that a lot of people would really care about those languages, and I really want

10:45.080 --> 10:46.080
to support them.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.840
It just, you know, it can't be the first thing to be done.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.920
We can't, you know, put the cart before the horse.

10:50.920 --> 10:51.920
Right.

10:51.920 --> 10:52.920
That makes sense.

10:52.920 --> 10:56.760
So I think that means that you get that right, and then once you get that right, you move

10:56.760 --> 10:58.000
on from there.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.880
But this looks like maybe, is it going to become a general IDE for GNOME eventually,

11:02.880 --> 11:05.720
like all kinds of languages in there, all kinds of support?

11:05.720 --> 11:07.640
I mean, that is certainly my goal.

11:07.640 --> 11:12.680
You know, I don't care what language you write GNOME software in, and most of us don't.

11:12.680 --> 11:16.400
So anything I can do to bring more people in and more people contributing, I'm perfectly

11:16.400 --> 11:17.640
happy to do that.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.120
You know, we already have basic support for some of these languages.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.000
You already get, like, Air Reporting for VALA.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.160
You already get Air Reporting for Go if you have, like, a working Go set up.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.840
So you know, even beyond GNOME, someday that's quite possible.

11:29.840 --> 11:34.600
But I definitely want to stay focused myself on, like, how do we build GNOME software better?

11:34.600 --> 11:36.240
Yeah.

11:36.240 --> 11:40.480
And it seems like this would be a great tool for when somebody asks the question, where

11:40.480 --> 11:41.720
do I get started?

11:41.720 --> 11:47.000
People can say, okay, get started with Builder and go from there, which is, it seems like

11:47.000 --> 11:50.900
such a simple thing to be able to say, but we have lacked that one coherent answer for

11:50.900 --> 11:54.040
so long that I've talked to a lot of developers who've been put off by that.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.200
It just seems like there's so many choices.

11:56.200 --> 12:00.280
And this represents, well, if you're going to go GNOME, if you're going to do GTK, start

12:00.280 --> 12:01.280
here.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.240
Now, that itself is a huge goal.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.680
And so I'm pretty impressed that you've raised $42,000.

12:07.680 --> 12:10.600
But what happens six, seven, eight months from now?

12:10.600 --> 12:11.720
This is your full-time job.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.080
That funding sort of begins to wane.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.520
How do you make it ongoing?

12:16.520 --> 12:17.520
What's the trick there?

12:17.520 --> 12:23.200
Yeah, I mean, I think a really important thing is to, number one, build a really strong community

12:23.200 --> 12:26.760
so we can all share the burden.

12:26.760 --> 12:31.160
But on the point that you mentioned there of having a single answer to tell people,

12:31.160 --> 12:32.920
that is really, really important.

12:32.920 --> 12:37.080
For my time spending helping people get started in free software, almost always the first

12:37.080 --> 12:39.360
question is, how do I get started?

12:39.360 --> 12:42.360
And it's a really monumental thing to get over.

12:42.360 --> 12:45.560
And you look at something like Android or whatever, you know, they have an IDE that

12:45.560 --> 12:50.160
you install, and there's other choices, but there's a blessed sort of way.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.400
And you enable developer mode on your phone.

12:52.400 --> 12:56.440
I'd really like to see that in terms of GNOME, you know, where you're just able to enable

12:56.440 --> 13:00.240
developer mode in the control settings, and then all of a sudden you have a complete development

13:00.240 --> 13:01.240
environment.

13:01.240 --> 13:05.600
And everything else is done underneath the hood, and you don't have to worry about it.

13:05.600 --> 13:10.480
So would a goal of yours be maybe to have Builder almost kind of considered a part of

13:10.480 --> 13:15.160
a GNOME desktop, maybe like in developer mode, where it's almost under the branch of GNOME?

13:15.160 --> 13:16.160
Absolutely.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.160
Fascinating.

13:17.160 --> 13:20.240
I mean, this is, I think, I contributed.

13:20.240 --> 13:23.840
I think it's just a great project initiative, and we'll have a link in the show notes.

13:23.840 --> 13:28.720
So Christian, I guess you're already working now, so does anything change for you now that

13:28.720 --> 13:30.800
this is successful, or are you just plowing on forward?

13:30.800 --> 13:36.660
Well, you know, the last couple of weeks I've been so busy with fundraising and communicating

13:36.660 --> 13:41.120
with people, and so the amount of code I've gotten written in January is significantly

13:41.120 --> 13:43.400
less than all of the other months.

13:43.400 --> 13:47.560
So I'm really looking forward to just, you know, putting the blinders on and writing

13:47.560 --> 13:48.560
code again.

13:48.560 --> 13:49.560
Yeah, absolutely.

13:49.560 --> 13:53.400
GNOME Builder has seen a lot of attention since we covered it in episode 76.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.760
And Wes, do you have any thoughts on it since that episode?

13:55.760 --> 13:58.440
Now, here we are at the end of the year.

13:58.440 --> 14:03.280
Only that I'm really excited for the future of a nice GNOME native Python IDE.

14:03.280 --> 14:04.280
Yeah.

14:04.280 --> 14:08.520
You know, I mean, I use Vim pretty much for everything, but a lot of my coworkers, they're

14:08.520 --> 14:13.160
using Sublime, they're using Atom, Visual Code, there's a lot of options these days.

14:13.160 --> 14:17.520
And I think GNOME needs something, and I think Python is used by, you know, it's installed

14:17.520 --> 14:18.520
by default.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.320
In a lot of places, GNOME is installed by default.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.720
So I'm excited in this new year to try out GNOME Builder.

14:23.720 --> 14:24.720
There you go.

14:24.720 --> 14:27.800
And I think that what I'm excited about is that it's given a lot of people like, hey,

14:27.800 --> 14:30.960
I want to create a desktop application, I want to use GTK.

14:30.960 --> 14:31.960
Something to target.

14:31.960 --> 14:32.960
What's my entrance path?

14:32.960 --> 14:33.960
Exactly.

14:33.960 --> 14:34.960
Yeah, I do like that quite a bit.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.960
All right, now, I want to move forward to something that was very exciting, very fun

14:36.960 --> 14:39.560
for us on episode 79 this year.

14:39.560 --> 14:44.280
It was the episode we did right before the new BQ Phone actually went on sale.

14:44.280 --> 14:48.000
Popey joined us and he went in depth on some of the stuff around it, and we just had a

14:48.000 --> 14:51.720
great discussion around the new launch and what people should expect about what we're

14:51.720 --> 14:53.800
all really here gathered today to talk about.

14:53.800 --> 14:57.880
And that's this new BQ Phone that goes on sale next week.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.600
It's like around 170, I think, what is that?

15:00.600 --> 15:02.080
Probably like 100, I don't know, about $175.

15:02.080 --> 15:05.360
I don't know what it's going for exactly, US.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.280
And there's even a little video.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.400
Now, I don't think there's a lot of words in this video, so I'll just, I'll just put

15:09.400 --> 15:10.680
it up on the stream so we can look at it.

15:10.680 --> 15:13.760
I mean, it's definitely a very fancy video.

15:13.760 --> 15:17.960
After all of the waiting, I mean, I know it's only been a couple of years, but it feels,

15:17.960 --> 15:20.200
I mean, that's a long time.

15:20.200 --> 15:24.440
In the scheme of developing something like this, that's not actually a long time, but

15:24.440 --> 15:27.840
for people sitting on the outside, it feels like a long time.

15:27.840 --> 15:31.000
And so this video is extremely well done.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.200
Popey, I don't know if, do you know any of the background on this video?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.200
Like this is-

15:34.200 --> 15:38.040
No, the first time I saw it was last Friday.

15:38.040 --> 15:42.600
It was shown off at an event in London and I'd never seen it before.

15:42.600 --> 15:46.080
And actually, the bits where you see outside that go on top of a building is actually on

15:46.080 --> 15:48.720
top of our office building.

15:48.720 --> 15:53.600
I can recognize certain parts of London in the video.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.520
I think, and we'll have the video linked in the show notes, I think one of the things

15:56.520 --> 16:01.400
the video does really well for me is it's essentially, without being too obvious about

16:01.400 --> 16:07.240
it, showing me kind of how Ubuntu Touch would sort of fit in with the ideal daily lifestyle

16:07.240 --> 16:08.920
that of course nobody truly lives.

16:08.920 --> 16:13.600
But if you live that, like I get like contextual information becomes available to me just by

16:13.600 --> 16:14.600
watching that commercial.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.720
Like it's surprisingly effective.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.200
Life at your fingertips is the slogan.

16:18.200 --> 16:19.480
That's pretty good.

16:19.480 --> 16:22.280
This is really well done.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.280
I think so.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.280
I think they did a nice job with it.

16:24.280 --> 16:27.260
I think it's going to be interesting to see where it goes to.

16:27.260 --> 16:33.120
So the Aquarius E4 5, 4.5, it's 4.5 inch screen, huh?

16:33.120 --> 16:34.960
Well, so there you go.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.680
So the BQ phone, it's not like, it's not a screamer of a phone.

16:37.680 --> 16:40.440
It's not going to blow you away with its stats.

16:40.440 --> 16:47.080
It's got a 4.5 inch screen, runs at 540 by 960 resolution, 1.3 gigahertz quad core ARM

16:47.080 --> 16:53.280
Cortex A7 MediaTek CPU, a Mali 400 GPU at 500 megahertz, again MediaTek, 8 gigabyte

16:53.280 --> 16:59.240
EMC storage, 1 gigabyte of RAM, 2150 mil amp battery, dual micro SIM, and 8 megapixel

16:59.240 --> 17:01.160
rear shooter.

17:01.160 --> 17:05.720
As far as first goes, it's not bad, especially if you consider that for a certain sector

17:05.720 --> 17:09.920
of the market, that's plenty phone.

17:09.920 --> 17:13.440
I think anyone coming into the smartphone space for the first time is going to be pleasantly

17:13.440 --> 17:14.440
surprised.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.520
And I think that's really where they're going to hit their sweet spot.

17:16.520 --> 17:17.520
That's where I would target.

17:17.520 --> 17:18.880
I think that seems like that's what they're doing.

17:18.880 --> 17:23.560
Now it's not launching in the US yet.

17:23.560 --> 17:24.560
But it is available.

17:24.560 --> 17:25.560
It'll be available.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.520
I wonder if I'll still be able to buy it.

17:27.520 --> 17:36.800
So the event that happened last Friday, there were 30 people invited from various places

17:36.800 --> 17:37.800
around the world.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.760
Yeah, it was called the Insiders event, the Ubuntu Insiders.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.460
They were actually invited a couple of months ago.

17:43.460 --> 17:47.720
We built a list of people that we thought might be interesting to come along and see

17:47.720 --> 17:48.720
it.

17:48.720 --> 17:55.880
And there was a couple of journalists, a couple of video bloggers, and some like blogger bloggers,

17:55.880 --> 18:02.240
quite written bloggers, and members of our community, developers, and what you might

18:02.240 --> 18:05.480
call outsiders from the community.

18:05.480 --> 18:12.600
Just come along and we give them a phone and they get to be the first people with one of

18:12.600 --> 18:13.600
these devices.

18:13.600 --> 18:19.300
We also gave them a few little tidbits of information over the month leading up to it.

18:19.300 --> 18:25.240
And then we flew them out to London on Friday and they came and saw that video and a couple

18:25.240 --> 18:31.240
of talks by, there was a guy from BQ there, there was a couple of people from Canonical

18:31.240 --> 18:33.200
giving talks.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.200
It was really good fun.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.760
And they got to leave with a phone, right?

18:36.760 --> 18:42.920
Yeah, we gave them all a phone and it was in a special origami presentation box.

18:42.920 --> 18:49.040
There was a phone and a pair of nice headphones.

18:49.040 --> 18:53.840
It even warranted the Ubuntu phones first official unboxing video, which OMG Ubuntu

18:53.840 --> 18:54.880
picked up and ran.

18:54.880 --> 18:55.880
Had a bunch of phone boxes.

18:55.880 --> 18:58.760
Slick, I got to say, that's a nice looking box.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.920
It was funny.

19:00.920 --> 19:05.240
We were asking them, look, do you mind if we video you opening because we know what

19:05.240 --> 19:06.240
it's like.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.000
People want to see the thing unboxed.

19:08.000 --> 19:14.080
And so the video that you're showing now of, that's Jordan Keys unboxing his, he actually

19:14.080 --> 19:19.120
ran back to his hotel room or ran back to another room in order to do that.

19:19.120 --> 19:22.920
And then we went out for beer in the evening while his video was rendering out.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.920
And then he uploaded it to YouTube when he got back after a few beers.

19:25.920 --> 19:26.920
Good sport.

19:26.920 --> 19:27.920
Good sport.

19:27.920 --> 19:28.920
It was good.

19:28.920 --> 19:29.920
It was a good day.

19:29.920 --> 19:34.360
I noticed too, I noticed that they come with a, the Insiders Edition came with a very nice

19:34.360 --> 19:36.280
set of just headphones, like an extra perk there.

19:36.280 --> 19:37.280
It's really cool.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.280
Yeah.

19:38.280 --> 19:41.860
Yeah, we wanted to give them a little bit of something extra to say thank you for taking

19:41.860 --> 19:46.120
part and, and, you know, coming all the way to the UK.

19:46.120 --> 19:49.680
I mean, some of them flew over, some of them didn't have fast come, but it was nice of

19:49.680 --> 19:53.000
them to come over and just take part and, and give us feedback as well.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.440
You know, we've been capturing feedback from them.

19:55.440 --> 19:59.720
It, you know, I was walking around on a Friday with a notebook, old style paper notebook,

19:59.720 --> 20:02.280
and people were saying, Hey, what about this?

20:02.280 --> 20:03.280
And how does that work?

20:03.280 --> 20:04.560
And why is this like this?

20:04.560 --> 20:09.920
And I was making lists and, you know, I've been giving feedback to developers and filing

20:09.920 --> 20:14.040
bugs, like, you know, doing all the due diligence because these are the first people that have

20:14.040 --> 20:15.080
seen them outside Canonical.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.080
We've all seen it evolve.

20:16.080 --> 20:19.640
You know, I've had one of those phones since August last year.

20:19.640 --> 20:23.600
And I use it every day, but there are things you just don't notice.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.960
And then when someone walks up to you and goes, Oh, why, why is it doing allowing me

20:26.960 --> 20:27.960
to do this?

20:27.960 --> 20:28.960
And you think, Oh, wow.

20:28.960 --> 20:29.960
Yeah, you're right.

20:29.960 --> 20:30.960
Yeah.

20:30.960 --> 20:31.960
Yeah.

20:31.960 --> 20:32.960
It's just something because you use it every day.

20:32.960 --> 20:33.960
You just don't think that's weird.

20:33.960 --> 20:34.960
You shouldn't do that.

20:34.960 --> 20:35.960
Yeah, very much so.

20:35.960 --> 20:36.960
That is very true.

20:36.960 --> 20:42.520
So, so actually they, they go on sale as a flash sale starting tomorrow, which is Wednesday,

20:42.520 --> 20:47.320
the 11th of February at eight, uh, eight o'clock UTC.

20:47.320 --> 20:52.180
So it's nine central European time, only going to be available for a limited time or suckers

20:52.180 --> 20:53.180
like me.

20:53.180 --> 20:56.480
Are we going to be able to buy it or is it only going to be, is it a regional day?

20:56.480 --> 21:02.080
So it's nine, nine, the central, uh, European time until six central, so eight till five

21:02.080 --> 21:03.080
UTC.

21:03.080 --> 21:06.380
Um, so yeah, it's a fairly lengthy amount of time throughout the day.

21:06.380 --> 21:08.640
It's not like, you know, a 10 minute flash sale.

21:08.640 --> 21:11.840
It's not like the whole world has to DDoS.

21:11.840 --> 21:14.720
So I might actually get one for the day.

21:14.720 --> 21:16.720
You could try, I have a shot.

21:16.720 --> 21:17.720
Yeah.

21:17.720 --> 21:19.720
I'm certainly going to bed early so I could get up.

21:19.720 --> 21:22.800
It's like Christmas for me tomorrow cause I'm going to be ordering one obviously.

21:22.800 --> 21:23.800
Yeah.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.520
Um, you know, we're, we're all going to be ordering them.

21:25.520 --> 21:27.080
Are you pretty excited?

21:27.080 --> 21:32.440
Yeah, it's, it's, you know, the fact that, you know, I started working at Canonical three

21:32.440 --> 21:37.440
years ago knowing that this was going to happen and it's taken a long time for us to get here.

21:37.440 --> 21:41.680
And we've, you know, we've had a lot of flack along the way and the method by which we've

21:41.680 --> 21:49.000
developed this and the software choices that we've made and the, the hardware specification

21:49.000 --> 21:54.280
of the first device, you know, this is, remember, this is the first Ubuntu phone, uh, hopefully

21:54.280 --> 22:01.080
one of many devices, you know, if we come back on, um, unplugged episode 600, there'll

22:01.080 --> 22:04.680
be, you know, a plethora of these phones out there, who knows, you know,

22:04.680 --> 22:07.120
Are you already looking at the next device a little bit?

22:07.120 --> 22:08.120
Cause I know they,

22:08.120 --> 22:09.120
Yeah, yeah.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.120
We've already said the next one is the Meizu.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.120
Yeah.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.320
It's going to be a little more, uh, like a larger screen, right?

22:13.320 --> 22:14.320
One thing.

22:14.320 --> 22:15.320
And, uh,

22:15.320 --> 22:16.320
Yeah, it's, uh, yeah.

22:16.320 --> 22:20.680
It's quite a bigger screen and more, it's, uh, more cores, more RAM, you know, more and

22:20.680 --> 22:21.680
bigger of everything.

22:21.680 --> 22:25.140
But, um, yeah, the moment we're just totally focused on the BQ1.

22:25.140 --> 22:29.160
How important was it, uh, you know, you mentioned that you've had one iteration of this, another

22:29.160 --> 22:30.320
since August.

22:30.320 --> 22:33.680
Is that part of why, you know, you got to start and you kind of have to lock in the

22:33.680 --> 22:35.840
specs at someplace and then start developing for that.

22:35.840 --> 22:41.080
And so, uh, this, the BQ phone, it's sort of been locked in for a while, I take it.

22:41.080 --> 22:42.080
Yeah.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.080
Right.

22:43.080 --> 22:46.440
And so we initially were, you know, we've had loads of different hardware over the time

22:46.440 --> 22:47.440
that we've developed this.

22:47.440 --> 22:53.280
We started off with a tablet edition on an Asus transformer TF-101 and we've moved through

22:53.280 --> 22:57.920
very, uh, Nokia N9 and various Samsung galaxies and nexus devices.

22:57.920 --> 23:00.600
And you know, then we got a partner in BQ.

23:00.600 --> 23:04.720
So we grabbed a bunch of those devices and we started doing the hardware enablement and

23:04.720 --> 23:08.640
making sure all the apps work because, you know, if we've been focusing on the Nexus

23:08.640 --> 23:12.400
4, then we discover that, oh, actually certain dialogues don't fit on the screen.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.400
I was wondering about that.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.000
Because this thing's slightly different.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.520
So we have to make sure all our apps and the dash is responsive and, you know, scales down

23:20.520 --> 23:22.400
to devices of this size.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.240
And it's actually made us more disciplined.

23:24.240 --> 23:29.640
Having a device that has more constrained hardware resources is probably better for

23:29.640 --> 23:30.640
us.

23:30.640 --> 23:35.920
If we'd have had the MX4 first and had, you know, octo core with two gig of RAM, we could

23:35.920 --> 23:40.720
have gone nuts and, you know, made some decisions that actually we'd regret later because we'd

23:40.720 --> 23:42.320
have to try and scale it back.

23:42.320 --> 23:48.520
Whereas from what I'm told, um, even unoptimized on the MX4, it flies along.

23:48.520 --> 23:51.800
I haven't actually got one myself, but I'm told it flies along.

23:51.800 --> 23:55.940
Um, and it's, you know, it's pretty good on this BQ device and we've still got some more

23:55.940 --> 23:57.240
optimization to do.

23:57.240 --> 24:00.440
Um, so yeah, there's still work and we're still ongoing.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.160
And the good thing is that we continue to deliver updates to that device.

24:04.160 --> 24:09.920
So even when we moved on to the, to the MX4 and the next device and the next device, all

24:09.920 --> 24:12.320
the previous devices continue to get those updates.

24:12.320 --> 24:15.480
God, the MX4 looks so sweet.

24:15.480 --> 24:16.480
Wow.

24:16.480 --> 24:18.520
This looks like a, yeah, yeah.

24:18.520 --> 24:22.160
I mean, I want the BQ just to have the experience, but I think the one I'm going to land on would

24:22.160 --> 24:23.160
be the MX4.

24:23.160 --> 24:24.680
This is an incredible phone.

24:24.680 --> 24:25.680
I want them all.

24:25.680 --> 24:26.680
Yeah, well sure.

24:26.680 --> 24:27.680
Of course.

24:27.680 --> 24:28.680
That's like trading cards.

24:28.680 --> 24:29.680
Yeah.

24:29.680 --> 24:30.680
Hmm.

24:30.680 --> 24:31.680
Yeah, exactly.

24:31.680 --> 24:32.680
Yeah.

24:32.680 --> 24:37.880
So how much, how much energy do you, do you suspect Canonical will put into, uh, sort

24:37.880 --> 24:41.120
of like, I don't want to know if a generic image is the right one, but an image that's

24:41.120 --> 24:45.000
essentially with some modifications that'll work on most smartphones.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.240
Is that something Canonical will ever do?

24:47.240 --> 24:50.200
You can't really do that because the ARM architecture is going to let you.

24:50.200 --> 24:54.400
So there's a couple of things, you know, ARM doesn't really have the concept that the PC

24:54.400 --> 24:59.040
world has in terms of ACPI and device discovery, you know, that's, that, that's very mature

24:59.040 --> 25:04.560
on the PC and you can have one co-base stick, a USB stick in it and it will boot, auto discover

25:04.560 --> 25:07.600
everything and figure out what drivers to load at runtime.

25:07.600 --> 25:15.160
Um, and the second problem is most, um, SOCs, most of the chips that are in phones have

25:15.160 --> 25:19.560
binary blobs and you know, that's, that's sad and disappointing and, but that's just

25:19.560 --> 25:21.540
the world we, we live in right now.

25:21.540 --> 25:25.460
There are no free soft, fully free software phones, none, none whatsoever.

25:25.460 --> 25:30.080
So whenever anyone complains to us that we're not a fully free software phone, well, good

25:30.080 --> 25:31.080
luck finding one.

25:31.080 --> 25:34.480
Well, yeah, if you want to, if you want a phone that makes phone calls, right?

25:34.480 --> 25:35.480
Yeah.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.840
Or is usable in any way, shape or form.

25:37.840 --> 25:43.640
Um, so we, you know, we, we have to build, um, an image that is usable, you know, usable

25:43.640 --> 25:47.880
on a specific device, but that's, that's actually where we've been quite cunning with this is

25:47.880 --> 25:53.240
that we have multiple layers to the, to the, um, image that goes on the, on the phone.

25:53.240 --> 25:56.120
That's the very base layer, which is the device specific part.

25:56.120 --> 25:59.880
And that's, you know, there'll be a device specific bit for BQ, a device specific bit

25:59.880 --> 26:03.120
for the MX4 and then ongoing devices.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.120
What is that?

26:04.120 --> 26:05.320
Is that, is that a specific kernel?

26:05.320 --> 26:07.360
What, what is that layer composed of?

26:07.360 --> 26:08.360
Yeah.

26:08.360 --> 26:13.320
So that's the, that's effectively the kernel and the drivers for things like the GPU, the

26:13.320 --> 26:17.600
radios and all that, the sensors, you know, so, so for example, if a device comes along

26:17.600 --> 26:20.840
that has a fingerprint sensor, just for the sake of argument, you know, we might want

26:20.840 --> 26:25.400
to support that and there'll be a device specific thing, driver that would need to go in.

26:25.400 --> 26:29.880
But on top of that is the second layer, which is the user space bit, which has got all of

26:29.880 --> 26:32.640
our Ubuntu stuff in and the dash.

26:32.640 --> 26:38.960
And then on top of that is your apps, but also the, the OEM or the carrier, um, can

26:38.960 --> 26:41.800
put their own additional bit on top.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.920
So, so we control a bit in the middle.

26:43.920 --> 26:50.000
That's, that's the, um, the app, the, the API and all the stuff people write.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Yeah.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.640
And the dash and the common bit that you would see across all the devices, the bit at the

26:54.640 --> 26:56.720
bottom is the device enablement.

26:56.720 --> 27:00.680
And so that means that when a new device comes out, all we need to do is do the device enablement

27:00.680 --> 27:03.720
and then it's the same user space that runs on those.

27:03.720 --> 27:08.760
And so when, when, when we want to update an old device, we just update the middle section

27:08.760 --> 27:12.400
and the device enablement bit stays the same.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.400
That's a really good approach.

27:13.400 --> 27:17.440
And it means you don't have that fragmentation that, that Android has.

27:17.440 --> 27:21.760
We have, you know, we can have lots of different devices on the market and they're all effectively

27:21.760 --> 27:22.760
running the same code.

27:22.760 --> 27:27.960
Well, and it seems like it's approachable by just a, you know, a fairly well organized

27:27.960 --> 27:31.320
community could come together and say, all right, well, we'll take on supporting the

27:31.320 --> 27:35.480
Nexus 4 for another couple of years, or we'll make a Nexus 5 port and me as a more sophisticated

27:35.480 --> 27:36.480
user could say, you know what?

27:36.480 --> 27:37.480
I know this community.

27:37.480 --> 27:40.520
I'll go use their image because if I'm following you, the only thing they would really have

27:40.520 --> 27:44.160
to modify would be that first layer, that, that lower level bits, right?

27:44.160 --> 27:45.160
Right.

27:45.160 --> 27:48.920
So if someone has already created the Nexus 5 port, as you know, and you know, it has

27:48.920 --> 27:51.000
issues, it's not perfect hardware wise.

27:51.000 --> 27:56.440
We're going to continue to maintain the Nexus 4, Nexus 7, and Nexus 10, and then whatever,

27:56.440 --> 28:00.920
wherever other devices come along that we have to support, you know, for a contractual

28:00.920 --> 28:05.640
agreement for things like PQ and Meizu and, and, and so on.

28:05.640 --> 28:09.600
So we'll continue to maintain, you know, a whole bunch of devices going, going forward.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.600
Hmm.

28:10.600 --> 28:11.600
All right.

28:11.600 --> 28:14.600
I got a couple more questions and then, and then we'll open up the moment.

28:14.600 --> 28:17.800
Here we are at the end of the year and it's been very interesting.

28:17.800 --> 28:18.800
Popey joins us.

28:18.800 --> 28:19.800
Hey Popey.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.480
So what are your thoughts now, a little bit after launch of the first phone and sort of

28:22.480 --> 28:24.440
looking back on all of that?

28:24.440 --> 28:28.080
So at the time when, you know, before it, before it was announced and before it was

28:28.080 --> 28:34.800
released, we really had no idea how many people would buy one and you know, whether, whether

28:34.800 --> 28:38.880
they would all get sent back or, you know, whether people would keep them or continue

28:38.880 --> 28:42.240
and develop software with it, you know, we just didn't know what people would do.

28:42.240 --> 28:45.960
And it turns out that, you know, now, however many months later, what is it now?

28:45.960 --> 28:51.280
Eight months later, we're still pushing out images, updates every six weeks.

28:51.280 --> 28:54.880
In fact, we're doing a, an extra one just before Christmas.

28:54.880 --> 28:59.360
I think you'll probably land on phones like a few days before Christmas with some you

28:59.360 --> 29:03.200
know, hot fix updates, but people are still using it.

29:03.200 --> 29:07.160
They're still using it for developing apps.

29:07.160 --> 29:10.680
Some people are using it as their daily driver, you know, not a huge number of people, but

29:10.680 --> 29:16.200
we didn't expect, you know, we weren't expecting millions of people to buy them, but what surprised

29:16.200 --> 29:22.800
us was BQ were so impressed with the sales figures that they wanted to sell another one

29:22.800 --> 29:25.000
and then they wanted to sell another one.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.080
And so next year there's going to be more phones from BQ.

29:28.080 --> 29:29.080
That's a big deal.

29:29.080 --> 29:30.080
That's really exciting.

29:30.080 --> 29:33.840
Of how successful it was this year, which is great because you know, that's validation

29:33.840 --> 29:37.280
that we're doing something right if one of our partners actually says to us, yeah, we

29:37.280 --> 29:38.280
want to make more of them.

29:38.280 --> 29:40.080
So yeah, it's been a good year.

29:40.080 --> 29:44.520
Yeah, that is probably the best benchmark to go by right there.

29:44.520 --> 29:45.520
Great point.

29:45.520 --> 29:49.520
So one of the things that I got a lot of crap for this year, and I feel like it maybe was

29:49.520 --> 29:53.480
a little undeserved looking back at it, but maybe it wasn't, I don't know, but I went

29:53.480 --> 29:56.000
on a rampage against ButterFS.

29:56.000 --> 30:01.200
In episode, let's see, what was it, I think 87, looking back on it, I think I declared

30:01.200 --> 30:03.200
it a clown file system.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.040
Okay, so I had a real rough day.

30:05.040 --> 30:09.880
I came in and I could not get my computer to start.

30:09.880 --> 30:16.000
I sat down at my desk, turned on the nice ASUS monitor that I am quite proud of acquiring,

30:16.000 --> 30:20.120
and I stare at a screen and it's nothing but errors, Matt.

30:20.120 --> 30:21.120
Nothing but errors.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.120
Oh no.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.880
And if you're watching the video version of the unplugged program, I'm going to pull those

30:24.880 --> 30:26.800
errors up on my screen right now.

30:26.800 --> 30:27.800
It was devastating.

30:27.800 --> 30:31.880
It starts as this, booting the Linux kernel, starting version 218.

30:31.880 --> 30:34.080
Oh yeah, you know what that is.

30:34.080 --> 30:41.760
And then, hold on a second, info, task mount 175, blocked for more than 120 seconds, uh-oh,

30:41.760 --> 30:47.200
uh-oh, task ButterFS transaction 197, blocked for more than 120 seconds, uh-oh, and that's

30:47.200 --> 30:48.320
all it ever did.

30:48.320 --> 30:52.880
And then now of course, so here's Chris's conundrum.

30:52.880 --> 30:57.560
Chris has a show he has to go to, and he needs a computer right now.

30:57.560 --> 31:03.000
I do not have really, so here's what runs through my head when my most important computer

31:03.000 --> 31:04.200
doesn't boot, I think to myself.

31:04.200 --> 31:08.360
Well, I should go grab a live USB stick and probably boot in there, see if I can get the

31:08.360 --> 31:12.400
main OS up and just, you know, maybe root in there and get everything I need and fix

31:12.400 --> 31:13.400
it later.

31:13.400 --> 31:16.680
Like I'm starting thinking like maybe I could like zombify this thing and like prop it up

31:16.680 --> 31:20.120
and like get in there, get my work done for the day and then like get out before the whole

31:20.120 --> 31:23.800
thing collapses out from underneath me, and I'm like, nah, I'm not going to do that.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.200
Okay, so I'm starting to think, okay, what are my other options?

31:26.200 --> 31:32.960
Well, I had just the night before installed Ubuntu Mate 1504 Beta 2, I think it is right

31:32.960 --> 31:33.960
now.

31:33.960 --> 31:34.960
I think that's the current one.

31:34.960 --> 31:35.960
That's right.

31:35.960 --> 31:36.960
That is.

31:36.960 --> 31:37.960
Yes.

31:37.960 --> 31:40.280
And so I had a USB stick already flashed.

31:40.280 --> 31:46.360
I love, you know what, also props to Ubuntu Mate, really, I think the only distro where

31:46.360 --> 31:51.280
you just go to their website and the download links and you put ddrescue up there, the command

31:51.280 --> 31:55.840
to run, and you just make it real clear, use ddrescue to write this ISO to a thumb drive.

31:55.840 --> 31:59.400
Everybody else always recommends dd, and a lot of times they don't just clearly put the

31:59.400 --> 32:02.200
command right there above the download links.

32:02.200 --> 32:06.600
It makes it so clear, and the fact that you also update the name of the ISO image so you

32:06.600 --> 32:10.120
literally could just copy that whole command is just brilliant.

32:10.120 --> 32:15.240
It is so helpful because I myself always end up using dd, and I forget to use ddrescue,

32:15.240 --> 32:18.920
which is way better to write an ISO file to a flash drive.

32:18.920 --> 32:21.540
So anyways, props to Mate.

32:21.540 --> 32:26.160
So I had this thumb stick ready to go, and I needed to get working right here right now.

32:26.160 --> 32:33.520
So I stick the Ubuntu Mate 1504 USB thumb drive into my rig, I reboot, and I get into

32:33.520 --> 32:34.520
the desktop environment.

32:34.520 --> 32:40.840
It's pretty snappy, in fact, it's unbelievably snappy.

32:40.840 --> 32:46.880
It's so fast that I was grousing to Rikai who was standing over me because he's trying

32:46.880 --> 32:54.440
to console me as I have been mortally wounded, and this gray screen comes up, and I start

32:54.440 --> 32:59.180
grousing, oh man, now I've got to wait for the fancy grub screen to render because this

32:59.180 --> 33:03.360
monitor is so large that anytime there's a big graphical grub screen comes up, it slowly

33:03.360 --> 33:07.200
paints onto my screen, and I'm sitting here grousing about that.

33:07.200 --> 33:10.800
And what I realized was that that actually wasn't the case at all.

33:10.800 --> 33:14.520
What I thought was the grub screen was actually X11 starting.

33:14.520 --> 33:19.080
It had booted so fast that I thought I was waiting for grub, but I was actually waiting

33:19.080 --> 33:20.160
for the entire desktop environment.

33:20.160 --> 33:21.600
It was amazing.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.600
It boots so fast.

33:22.600 --> 33:23.600
It was so cool.

33:23.600 --> 33:24.600
So I install.

33:24.600 --> 33:27.120
I'm like, after that, I'm like, that's it?

33:27.120 --> 33:28.120
That's all I needed?

33:28.120 --> 33:30.720
I just needed my computer to be really fast and I just want to get back to work as fast

33:30.720 --> 33:31.720
as possible.

33:31.720 --> 33:33.040
I've got to do some clipping.

33:33.040 --> 33:39.600
And so I installed Ubuntu Mate on my main workstation, this is my rig up in my office,

33:39.600 --> 33:44.040
and I used it for a couple of days, a day, I think I used it for a day actually, and

33:44.040 --> 33:45.520
I ran into a couple of issues.

33:45.520 --> 33:52.560
First of all, here's the thing you don't want to do.

33:52.560 --> 33:58.840
It's not really a great idea to use a beta version on your main workstation because so

33:58.840 --> 34:02.080
many of the PPAs out there don't work with it.

34:02.080 --> 34:04.600
They expect you to be on a released version of Ubuntu.

34:04.600 --> 34:11.000
So as soon as you start setting up PPAs for like themes or like a calendar widget or whatever,

34:11.000 --> 34:15.220
you just start getting 404s in your app get update like an animal constantly.

34:15.220 --> 34:16.680
It's just a horrible mess.

34:16.680 --> 34:19.720
And then you end up like, you know, having to go out there and pull some of them out.

34:19.720 --> 34:24.600
So that was a bit disappointing and things like Telegram not working sort of were deal

34:24.600 --> 34:25.600
breakers for me.

34:25.600 --> 34:29.080
And I ended up going back with Antigros because it was it was so early in the process, I could

34:29.080 --> 34:30.080
jump back.

34:30.080 --> 34:33.640
So now I'm sort of at square zero and sort of setting up and trying to get advice from

34:33.640 --> 34:37.960
the audience on what should I try because I haven't set this machine up in about a year

34:37.960 --> 34:38.960
and a half.

34:38.960 --> 34:39.960
So what would you try at this point?

34:39.960 --> 34:45.200
And I've already got some base stuff on there, but I have to say it was pretty slick.

34:45.200 --> 34:51.600
So here's a couple of things I did in Ubuntu Mate 1504 is I used Ubuntu or I'm sorry, mate

34:51.600 --> 34:55.960
tweak to turn on compass and to set my style.

34:55.960 --> 34:59.320
So I had like a more of a bar layout that I liked quite a bit.

34:59.320 --> 35:01.960
And that was really, really easy to set up.

35:01.960 --> 35:02.960
Really slick.

35:02.960 --> 35:06.200
I decided I opted to use the new mate menu.

35:06.200 --> 35:09.680
And I was pleased to see the super key activated that.

35:09.680 --> 35:10.760
So I was all really good.

35:10.760 --> 35:13.560
The main problems I ran into with the mate menu were like sometimes when I hit the super

35:13.560 --> 35:15.920
key, it would pop up behind other windows.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.140
So when I would type, I couldn't see the results.

35:18.140 --> 35:20.480
And sometimes it was a little delayed and popping up.

35:20.480 --> 35:23.880
So I'd probably still if I was going to stick with that desktop, I would probably use a

35:23.880 --> 35:27.620
dedicated launcher like synapse or gnome do or whatever the hell.

35:27.620 --> 35:30.920
But it's such a nice setup.

35:30.920 --> 35:35.200
Like I was using that and I could physically I just felt my computer was like it felt like

35:35.200 --> 35:36.200
it was running faster.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.360
And I really was impressed by that.

35:38.360 --> 35:40.920
So Ubuntu Mate edition 1504 is looking really sharp.

35:40.920 --> 35:44.840
I ended up keeping it on the computer I'm setting up for my son.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.800
So he'll be running that for a while.

35:46.800 --> 35:51.520
And I'm now running Antigros with gnome 3 on my main office workstation.

35:51.520 --> 35:53.520
And it was tough.

35:53.520 --> 35:54.520
It was tough.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.520
It was really tough.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.080
Now, did anybody catch that error message?

35:57.080 --> 35:58.400
And maybe what was the problem?

35:58.400 --> 36:00.400
Oh, you did, poppy?

36:00.400 --> 36:01.400
Yeah.

36:01.400 --> 36:05.880
So how long did you leave it after the four minutes?

36:05.880 --> 36:08.920
I actually left it overnight.

36:08.920 --> 36:09.920
And it just kept repeating.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.440
Yeah, and it just kept repeating the same message.

36:12.440 --> 36:13.440
Interesting.

36:13.440 --> 36:17.240
So my home server running better fs does that now and again.

36:17.240 --> 36:20.200
And all I do, but that's after it's booted, like and it's fine.

36:20.200 --> 36:21.200
And it's up.

36:21.200 --> 36:25.640
I just SSH in an echo zero as it says, and then I never see that error message again.

36:25.640 --> 36:29.620
Because it's only an informational message to say, yeah, holy crap, there's a truckload

36:29.620 --> 36:31.680
of IO going on right now.

36:31.680 --> 36:32.680
Here's what I think it is.

36:32.680 --> 36:36.520
I think blackout 24 is calling it right now in the IRC and I think roof chicken in our

36:36.520 --> 36:38.280
subreddit called it.

36:38.280 --> 36:43.120
Another better fs gotcha has been added to the gotcha wiki entry for butter fs.

36:43.120 --> 36:44.120
That's how I see it.

36:44.120 --> 36:49.800
Stable kernel versions 3.19.1 can cause a deadlock at mount time.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.440
That's one of the new gotchas in the butter fs.

36:52.440 --> 36:56.160
And I think this is exactly what happened to me.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.920
I think I'm on a rolling release.

36:57.920 --> 36:58.920
I'm on a rolling release.

36:58.920 --> 37:03.160
And they wanted the packages with systemd and butter fs, right?

37:03.160 --> 37:04.160
What's that?

37:04.160 --> 37:07.760
And they want to do the packages with systemd and butter fs, right?

37:07.760 --> 37:08.760
Yeah.

37:08.760 --> 37:09.760
Yeah.

37:09.760 --> 37:10.760
Yeah.

37:10.760 --> 37:11.760
So there are workarounds.

37:11.760 --> 37:13.040
So if I would have looked this up, there's workarounds.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.800
But you know what?

37:14.800 --> 37:16.920
This is what I came to.

37:16.920 --> 37:19.860
I am so effing done with effing butter fs.

37:19.860 --> 37:21.280
It is not even funny.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.760
So when I was like, you know what?

37:22.760 --> 37:24.660
I don't care that I can fix this.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.000
I'm going XFS.

37:26.000 --> 37:30.720
So what I decided to do is my boot partition, which is about 250 megabytes, is extended

37:30.720 --> 37:31.720
for.

37:31.720 --> 37:34.080
Everything else on the system is XFS.

37:34.080 --> 37:39.920
My root file system, my home partition, my editing partitions, my gaming, all XFS, only

37:39.920 --> 37:40.920
XFS.

37:40.920 --> 37:42.200
Butter fs is dead to me.

37:42.200 --> 37:47.600
This is the second system I have, to quote unquote, kind of soft lost to butter fs.

37:47.600 --> 37:50.520
As in, I could have fixed it if I really effing wanted to.

37:50.520 --> 37:52.920
In the Bonobos case, I would have had to format.

37:52.920 --> 37:56.320
And in this case, I would have had to do a workaround for the timeout.

37:56.320 --> 37:57.320
It's stupid.

37:57.320 --> 37:58.840
It's a clown file system.

37:58.840 --> 38:02.200
It's nowhere near ready, close to quality of ZFS.

38:02.200 --> 38:06.680
And XFS has a rich history behind it, and probably has another 20 years left of development

38:06.680 --> 38:07.680
in it.

38:07.680 --> 38:12.000
So for my taste, I'm going XFS on everything that's important to me, my back end storage.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.320
I'm not even going to use a Linux file system.

38:14.320 --> 38:15.320
I'm going to use ZFS.

38:15.320 --> 38:16.320
I know.

38:16.320 --> 38:17.840
I kind of feel like maybe I'm the one guy out here.

38:17.840 --> 38:20.520
But Wes, you were just saying, you're still a butter fs fan.

38:20.520 --> 38:21.520
Yeah.

38:21.520 --> 38:22.900
You know, I have a RAID 1 set up at home.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.400
That's what my MB runs off of.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.360
That's kind of my main data store.

38:26.360 --> 38:29.680
And Popey, you're still a maniac running butter fs over there, aren't you?

38:29.680 --> 38:30.680
Yeah.

38:30.680 --> 38:34.960
I'm just looking across at my little home server, chugging away there with, I think,

38:34.960 --> 38:39.920
12 disks in it, chugging away, still backing up all my stuff, hosting all my music.

38:39.920 --> 38:41.520
The scrubs come out clean.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.520
That's what's important.

38:42.520 --> 38:43.520
OK.

38:43.520 --> 38:44.520
All right.

38:44.520 --> 38:45.520
Yeah.

38:45.520 --> 38:48.000
It's got to the point now where I don't even bother checking any of the cron jobs, because

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
I know it's fine.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
It's just fine.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
All right.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.920
Well, we'll check back in with you next year.

38:52.920 --> 39:00.400
Is that going to be how it's going to stay, because ZFS was a preview in Ubuntu 15.10,

39:00.400 --> 39:07.880
and it's all gearing up for officially being unveiled for 16.04, so I think ZFS is going

39:07.880 --> 39:08.880
to win.

39:08.880 --> 39:09.880
So that's going to be tricky.

39:09.880 --> 39:10.880
That tune's going to change.

39:10.880 --> 39:11.880
Is that what you're saying?

39:11.880 --> 39:18.080
When 16.04 comes out, I'll certainly look at it, but I'm not going to migrate, because

39:18.080 --> 39:23.640
I don't want to try one of these untested, brand new file systems that...

39:23.640 --> 39:28.720
And you know, to be fair, BSD isn't actually used at scale, so it hasn't really been truly

39:28.720 --> 39:29.720
tested yet.

39:29.720 --> 39:35.000
And that Solaris that they took it from, that's...

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Nobody ever used that.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Nobody ever used that.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.840
That's not professional.

39:39.840 --> 39:44.920
So speaking of things that we can barely remember, there was one little controversy that the

39:44.920 --> 39:49.960
Unplugged show kind of found itself in the middle of, and that was the name change for

39:49.960 --> 39:54.920
Sol OS, or Solus, but don't call it Solus OS, because, well, that could get them in

39:54.920 --> 39:55.920
trouble.

39:55.920 --> 39:56.920
Don't call it Evolve OS anymore.

39:56.920 --> 39:58.080
No, sir, no, sir.

39:58.080 --> 40:01.640
The project name has changed to Avoid Unnecessary Legal Action.

40:01.640 --> 40:03.520
Oh, boy.

40:03.520 --> 40:06.000
So we have Aiki and Ryan here.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.640
Aiki, do you want to tell us what happened then?

40:08.640 --> 40:14.920
So, yeah, that was a fun week.

40:14.920 --> 40:18.120
Yeah, I've really loved how this has really gone.

40:18.120 --> 40:24.320
So on April Fool's Day, of all days, I basically got an email come through, and it said that

40:24.320 --> 40:28.040
I was getting a letter coming through as well, which is like, okay, this is just pure lols.

40:28.040 --> 40:30.400
I was like, yeah, okay.

40:30.400 --> 40:34.920
So I ended up phoning up the people involved independently, finding the phone number for

40:34.920 --> 40:43.080
this place separately, and it actually does check out, so I was like, ah.

40:43.080 --> 40:46.640
So the trademark is very, very much specific to the UK.

40:46.640 --> 40:52.040
So a couple of months ago, we were having problems with people, a completely unrelated

40:52.040 --> 40:57.120
incident by the way, but we were having problems with people trying to assert ownership over

40:57.120 --> 40:58.120
the brand.

40:58.120 --> 41:03.640
So I took a couple of steps, and I basically went ahead and put in a trademark application,

41:03.640 --> 41:08.400
not to be a patent troll, but just to stop people trying to pull one over on the project.

41:08.400 --> 41:12.000
So that was like, so in the UK, that happens for a couple of months, and it's put up so

41:12.000 --> 41:17.200
people can, you know, they can object to it and say, hey, we own that, which someone did.

41:17.200 --> 41:24.560
And it's held by the Secretary of State in the UK, and they own the trademark for OS,

41:24.560 --> 41:26.120
which I did not see coming.

41:26.120 --> 41:27.120
Wow.

41:27.120 --> 41:28.120
Wow.

41:28.120 --> 41:29.120
Really?

41:29.120 --> 41:30.120
Whoa.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.320
I could understand if it was Evolve, like when I was reading through the letter, I was

41:32.320 --> 41:38.160
looking for the word Evolve, but no, it was for OS, I was like, are you kidding me?

41:38.160 --> 41:40.000
So yeah, I mean, that absolutely and utterly sucks.

41:40.000 --> 41:45.320
I was like, you know, that's one thing that Linux projects are traditionally done to avoid

41:45.320 --> 41:50.980
that kind of thing, like have a suffix of OS or Linux or something like that.

41:50.980 --> 41:53.400
So yeah, I mean, that absolutely and utterly sucks.

41:53.400 --> 41:58.240
So we went through on Google Plus for a couple of, well, I think it was about two days asking

41:58.240 --> 42:04.640
for suggestions done on IRC, and, you know, we got absolutely nowhere with a fitting name.

42:04.640 --> 42:08.840
So I just went back to a name that we've used before, which was Solus, but without the OS

42:08.840 --> 42:09.840
perp.

42:09.840 --> 42:10.840
Interesting to follow that project.

42:10.840 --> 42:11.840
And now, of course, here we are.

42:11.840 --> 42:14.880
They've shipped their early versions, and we've even done a review.

42:14.880 --> 42:18.080
And I was kind of curious, Poppy, on your thoughts now, kind of looking back towards

42:18.080 --> 42:20.960
the end of the year on this kind of situation.

42:20.960 --> 42:23.640
I looked at this, and I thought, oh, it's yet another distro.

42:23.640 --> 42:24.640
Who needs that?

42:24.640 --> 42:26.920
And they're doing their own desktop.

42:26.920 --> 42:27.920
It's weird.

42:27.920 --> 42:28.920
Yeah.

42:28.920 --> 42:29.920
We don't know anything about that.

42:29.920 --> 42:33.460
And he's barely getting all these builds done in time.

42:33.460 --> 42:37.760
But now when you look at it, and he's got this stonking great Intel server in his flat

42:37.760 --> 42:42.040
that he's doing all his builds on, and he's churning out loads of social media posts with

42:42.040 --> 42:48.880
screenshots all the time and boot times and, you know, the policy there seems to be genuine

42:48.880 --> 42:51.120
community interest as well.

42:51.120 --> 42:57.720
Yeah, it's nice to see someone who is strongly opinionated about what he wants from his distro

42:57.720 --> 43:01.720
and is driving it the way he wants to do.

43:01.720 --> 43:05.360
And he listens to input from others, and he's got a community of people who are contributing

43:05.360 --> 43:06.360
as well.

43:06.360 --> 43:09.160
But he's going for it, and I wish him every success.

43:09.160 --> 43:10.480
Yeah, I completely agree.

43:10.480 --> 43:12.840
I think that's well put.

43:12.840 --> 43:18.200
And the first early releases of it, and like the one we reviewed, are actually surprisingly

43:18.200 --> 43:19.200
impressive.

43:19.200 --> 43:22.520
And I don't mean to be demeaned when I say surprising, but it's just what they have to

43:22.520 --> 43:25.120
work with and some of the challenges they've had to face.

43:25.120 --> 43:29.880
It's a whole lot of fresh energy in the ecosystem is kind of what it feels like.

43:29.880 --> 43:33.300
Maybe it's not the direction everyone wants, but it's like, that's a lot of effort put

43:33.300 --> 43:37.100
in, and that can only have good, you know, consequences.

43:37.100 --> 43:42.080
It's the first new truly independent distribution for a long, long time, and I think that's

43:42.080 --> 43:44.520
what's driving a lot of the interest around the project.

43:44.520 --> 43:45.520
Yeah, right.

43:45.520 --> 43:47.760
It's built from scratch, and it really is something unique.

43:47.760 --> 43:49.720
Yeah, that's a great point.

43:49.720 --> 43:56.960
You know, as somebody who, on this show specifically, has talked a lot about Firefox versus Chrome,

43:56.960 --> 43:57.960
you never...

43:57.960 --> 43:58.960
Me?

43:58.960 --> 43:59.960
I know.

43:59.960 --> 44:00.960
I didn't know quite...

44:00.960 --> 44:01.960
It was very incongruent for me.

44:01.960 --> 44:02.960
I didn't know what to make out of this story.

44:02.960 --> 44:07.560
Do you remember when a Debian package manager, a maintainer over at Debian, found out that

44:07.560 --> 44:12.000
Chrome was downloading a binary in the background and enabling our microphones?

44:12.000 --> 44:13.200
Yes, I do.

44:13.200 --> 44:19.960
We had a good conversation around that, and then it went into a much wider conversation

44:19.960 --> 44:21.760
than I thought was really interesting.

44:21.760 --> 44:25.280
Okay, so anybody want to jump in first on this Chrome topic?

44:25.280 --> 44:28.320
To me, it seems like this is the line too far.

44:28.320 --> 44:29.320
And here's...

44:29.320 --> 44:33.640
I already told this story, so I'll keep it brief, but here's what made me realize this.

44:33.640 --> 44:35.360
Let's see.

44:35.360 --> 44:38.760
It was Father's Day.

44:38.760 --> 44:42.400
I was seeing family, and this family, it was a couple.

44:42.400 --> 44:49.200
They have two Samsung S4 phones, a couple years old now, because the S6 is out, right?

44:49.200 --> 44:54.440
And before they installed this update they got, they wanted to come see me.

44:54.440 --> 44:55.440
So I look at their update, oh, it's Lollipop.

44:55.440 --> 44:57.000
Oh, good, you guys are going to get Lollipop.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
Great, great.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
Yeah, this is a good update.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
You're really going to like Lollipop.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Let's do it.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
Let's install it.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
So we plug in their chargers.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
We hit the update.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.160
It takes like an hour, because it's got to update all their apps too.

45:06.160 --> 45:08.760
It says it's going to take 30 minutes.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.760
It does not take 30 minutes.

45:10.760 --> 45:11.760
And it updates all their apps.

45:11.760 --> 45:14.960
Well, one of the new apps it gives them is Google Photos.

45:14.960 --> 45:16.720
Oh, okay, Google Photos.

45:16.720 --> 45:17.720
All right, cool.

45:17.720 --> 45:20.440
So I'm showing them, well, I've got Google Photos on my phone.

45:20.440 --> 45:21.440
Let me show it to you.

45:21.440 --> 45:22.440
And I bust it out.

45:22.440 --> 45:25.160
I'm like, this right here is Google Photos, and it is so great.

45:25.160 --> 45:29.400
I do not have time to tag and organize my photos, and I don't ever manage it, and this

45:29.400 --> 45:33.000
just automatically backs them up to Google servers for me, unlimited storage, and I'm

45:33.000 --> 45:36.520
just going into the whole thing, talking about how great it is.

45:36.520 --> 45:37.680
And look at this, I say.

45:37.680 --> 45:40.920
And I bust out the search feature, and I'm like, it's tagged every person's face.

45:40.920 --> 45:42.840
And look, it knows this is food.

45:42.840 --> 45:43.840
These are flowers.

45:43.840 --> 45:44.840
That's an object.

45:44.840 --> 45:45.840
That's a car.

45:45.840 --> 45:48.320
That's a whatever, a holiday.

45:48.320 --> 45:50.800
It's gone through and figured all this stuff out, and I'm like, so check this out.

45:50.800 --> 45:51.800
And I hit the search button.

45:51.800 --> 45:56.800
I say, show me all the pictures of my son, Dylan, at Christmas.

45:56.800 --> 45:57.880
And I'm like, and check this out.

45:57.880 --> 45:59.560
I've never tagged any of these photos.

45:59.560 --> 46:02.880
And the Google Photos app instantaneously, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, auto-populates the search

46:02.880 --> 46:03.880
results.

46:03.880 --> 46:05.320
Here's all the pictures with Dylan at Christmas.

46:05.320 --> 46:07.040
And I'm like, isn't that awesome?

46:07.040 --> 46:08.040
Isn't that great?

46:08.040 --> 46:09.440
I never told it this is Christmas.

46:09.440 --> 46:10.840
I never told it this is Dylan.

46:10.840 --> 46:13.760
It just figured all that out by importing my pictures.

46:13.760 --> 46:18.500
And they look at me like I am a crazy person.

46:18.500 --> 46:22.520
They look at me like, so how does it know that's Dylan?

46:22.520 --> 46:25.200
And I'm like, well, it looks at the face.

46:25.200 --> 46:28.200
So it knows the faces of everybody you take pictures of?

46:28.200 --> 46:29.460
Yeah.

46:29.460 --> 46:32.440
So it knows everybody you ever hang out with that's in your photos?

46:32.440 --> 46:33.440
Yeah.

46:33.440 --> 46:34.600
And I won't say this guy.

46:34.600 --> 46:36.560
Let's just call him Jim.

46:36.560 --> 46:39.240
And they say to me, they say, well, what about your buddy Jim?

46:39.240 --> 46:44.760
He intentionally, it's his mission in life never to have a presence online.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.540
He never wants to be tagged in any photos.

46:46.540 --> 46:47.540
He doesn't have a Facebook profile.

46:47.540 --> 46:49.000
He doesn't have a Twitter account.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.700
He doesn't have a Google account.

46:50.700 --> 46:51.700
What about him?

46:51.700 --> 46:52.700
What about Jim?

46:52.700 --> 46:53.700
He's in some of your photos.

46:53.700 --> 46:55.640
I'm like, oh, yeah, Jim is in some of my photos.

46:55.640 --> 46:59.640
So now Google knows that you hang out with Jim even though Jim never wants to be online.

46:59.640 --> 47:02.560
Yeah, I guess.

47:02.560 --> 47:06.380
And so I expected them to be like, oh, man, this is going to be so convenient.

47:06.380 --> 47:07.680
Now I don't have to worry about managing my photos.

47:07.680 --> 47:11.840
I don't have to worry about losing my photos when I get rid of my phone.

47:11.840 --> 47:17.480
But because they had never been introduced, and this is my theory, because they had not

47:17.480 --> 47:21.880
really been introduced to some of this Google stuff, they just were kind of all of a sudden

47:21.880 --> 47:26.480
thrown in on the deep end on one of the more kind of creepier things Google can do.

47:26.480 --> 47:28.800
And they weren't sort of slowly introduced to it.

47:28.800 --> 47:33.140
They didn't see it like be introduced through Google Plus and slowly develop with auto awesome

47:33.140 --> 47:34.400
features getting rolled out.

47:34.400 --> 47:35.840
And they didn't see the whole evolution of it.

47:35.840 --> 47:38.720
They just kind of went in, boom.

47:38.720 --> 47:40.560
And they're like, whoa, this is way too much.

47:40.560 --> 47:44.540
And now they're not going to use it.

47:44.540 --> 47:50.780
And then I thought, could you imagine if I told them that their Google web browser was

47:50.780 --> 47:54.800
automatically downloading a program in the background that turns on their microphone

47:54.800 --> 47:58.840
so that way they can say, OK, Google, what's the weather like?

47:58.840 --> 48:02.520
They would think I'm a crazy person.

48:02.520 --> 48:05.800
So when I think about it through their perspective, I think, gosh, maybe this has gone way too

48:05.800 --> 48:06.800
far.

48:06.800 --> 48:11.040
Maybe we are sitting here in the boiling pot just, ah, it's Googles.

48:11.040 --> 48:12.040
You know what they mean.

48:12.040 --> 48:13.200
Well, there's just one more thing, right?

48:13.200 --> 48:14.200
But hey, they fixed it.

48:14.200 --> 48:15.200
Right?

48:15.200 --> 48:16.200
Now you can opt out.

48:16.200 --> 48:18.080
So it's just no big deal.

48:18.080 --> 48:19.520
And we just keep on going.

48:19.520 --> 48:20.520
One more thing.

48:20.520 --> 48:21.520
One more.

48:21.520 --> 48:24.080
But every now and then, I have like these reality checks where I talk to people outside

48:24.080 --> 48:25.840
the tech bubble.

48:25.840 --> 48:28.180
And I expect them to be like, oh, man, that's great.

48:28.180 --> 48:31.400
And they're like, whoa, are you OK with that?

48:31.400 --> 48:33.120
Does Jim know you've done that?

48:33.120 --> 48:38.160
And I'm like, oh, and I felt like, jeez, I didn't really think about that.

48:38.160 --> 48:41.600
Like, I had thought about it, but I didn't really, really, really wrap my head around

48:41.600 --> 48:42.600
it.

48:42.600 --> 48:43.600
And then this thing happens.

48:43.600 --> 48:44.600
So Mumbler, what do you think?

48:44.600 --> 48:45.600
Is this the line too far?

48:45.600 --> 48:46.680
Sean, I want to start with you.

48:46.680 --> 48:47.680
Go ahead.

48:47.680 --> 48:53.400
Well, bottom line is anything that can compromise my privacy, I want to be asked first before

48:53.400 --> 48:55.720
you add it to my stuff.

48:55.720 --> 48:56.720
Good point.

48:56.720 --> 48:58.680
North Ranger, what do you think?

48:58.680 --> 49:03.940
I don't think we should be surprised, because we've seen this before with Android, replacing

49:03.940 --> 49:09.560
gallery apps, camera apps with the closed source Google versions.

49:09.560 --> 49:12.400
Well, and that's actually what I was going to ask Wimpy.

49:12.400 --> 49:14.820
And the value of this is negative.

49:14.820 --> 49:17.840
Is this, once again, RMS being right, or are we overreacting?

49:17.840 --> 49:23.480
Is this what we get for using a proprietary browser by an advertising company that wants

49:23.480 --> 49:26.480
to make life more convenient?

49:26.480 --> 49:30.600
But Chromium is not a proprietary application, is it?

49:30.600 --> 49:33.480
No, but it still happened, didn't it?

49:33.480 --> 49:34.480
Yeah.

49:34.480 --> 49:40.680
And so it probably happened because this is how Chrome is packaged, how Chromium is packaged,

49:40.680 --> 49:44.320
because the two are very closely related.

49:44.320 --> 49:49.400
But the question here is, is who is the package maintainer?

49:49.400 --> 49:54.400
Because if you're using a Linux distribution, ultimately, you're placing your trust in the

49:54.400 --> 49:58.960
person that makes the binary packages that you install on your system.

49:58.960 --> 50:06.640
Because, as I said earlier, for a brief moment, for example, I'm a maintainer for Debian and

50:06.640 --> 50:08.160
for Arch Linux.

50:08.160 --> 50:11.760
So for a brief moment, I have root on your system.

50:11.760 --> 50:15.880
And the question is, do you trust me?

50:15.880 --> 50:19.640
And there are a lot of people out there that are in that position.

50:19.640 --> 50:20.640
Yeah.

50:20.640 --> 50:26.240
So there are processes in place with the distributions, and they do things a little bit differently.

50:26.240 --> 50:33.280
I think Debian is far more rigorous than some of the other distributions in terms of the

50:33.280 --> 50:37.240
checks and balances that are in place to ensure that the packages are of a suitable quality

50:37.240 --> 50:41.160
and they don't do anything untoward.

50:41.160 --> 50:47.640
But yeah, you take any distribution, and ultimately, you have to say to yourself, for a moment,

50:47.640 --> 50:53.680
somebody somewhere created this package, and they have root on my system.

50:53.680 --> 50:54.680
That's a sobering thought.

50:54.680 --> 50:57.280
And I think it's a good perspective for us to take because it is the reality.

50:57.280 --> 51:04.460
And when you think of it in that context, in that perspective, you can see why there

51:04.460 --> 51:07.480
are other solutions being worked on.

51:07.480 --> 51:08.480
And this is, yeah, exactly.

51:08.480 --> 51:14.040
And this is why things like atomic and snappy packages and click packages are becoming a

51:14.040 --> 51:21.480
thing because, for example, on Android, when you install an app on your Android phone,

51:21.480 --> 51:24.720
that app during the install process does not have root.

51:24.720 --> 51:25.720
Hmm.

51:25.720 --> 51:27.280
Very good point.

51:27.280 --> 51:28.280
Yeah.

51:28.280 --> 51:29.280
Okay.

51:29.280 --> 51:33.680
Inagogo, I want to give you a chance to say maybe Jim is a lost cause, that him never

51:33.680 --> 51:36.720
having an online presence is not possible in 2015.

51:36.720 --> 51:38.080
Should I not feel so bad?

51:38.080 --> 51:42.760
Well, it's kind of not possible because he could have walked past a shop that is selling

51:42.760 --> 51:48.120
its CCTV camera with an app that you can download on the app, so that lets you see CCTV cameras.

51:48.120 --> 51:49.120
Sure.

51:49.120 --> 51:50.120
That then means he's been online.

51:50.120 --> 51:51.120
That's true.

51:51.120 --> 51:56.200
It is quite hard to avoid cameras nowadays that all use the internet.

51:56.200 --> 51:57.200
Yeah.

51:57.200 --> 51:58.560
Isn't that so true?

51:58.560 --> 52:01.520
So here's what I wanted to kind of put out there as maybe a feeler.

52:01.520 --> 52:07.680
If you go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com, find episode 98 feedback thread.

52:07.680 --> 52:12.880
Why could I recommend them that they could put on a phone, it'd be great if it supported

52:12.880 --> 52:18.400
iOS and Android, so maybe I could use it myself, that would work for backup.

52:18.400 --> 52:27.180
So I tried BitTorrent Sync, it'll copy pictures off, but it's not the same thing to just copy

52:27.180 --> 52:30.940
the data as it is to actually have a little intelligence behind it.

52:30.940 --> 52:32.800
There's another app out there called Picture Life.

52:32.800 --> 52:36.680
This is a private company they recently bought up that does the same thing that Google Photos

52:36.680 --> 52:37.680
does privately.

52:37.680 --> 52:38.680
You pay more for it.

52:38.680 --> 52:39.680
I don't know.

52:39.680 --> 52:40.680
I actually forget.

52:40.680 --> 52:44.000
I just was looking at it sort of casually, and it automatically backups your photos,

52:44.000 --> 52:48.480
does the face tagging, does sort of like location tagging and tracking, but it's a separate

52:48.480 --> 52:49.480
private company.

52:49.480 --> 52:51.840
It's not part of an information behemoth.

52:51.840 --> 52:56.320
That's kind of appealing, but I would really like an open source solution for photo backup.

52:56.320 --> 52:59.840
Something where the user can let it run in the background, automatically copy the photos

52:59.840 --> 53:07.120
off sort of like Google Photos does, or BitTorrent Sync, or Dropbox, or actually I think there's

53:07.120 --> 53:08.120
even a way to do it with OwnCloud.

53:08.120 --> 53:12.000
I haven't – yeah, okay, yeah, Mr. Grumpy R says, yeah, there is a way to do it with

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
OwnCloud.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
I haven't really played with that.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.160
That might be worth playing with, but then see they'd have to have an OwnCloud server.

53:17.160 --> 53:19.000
Yeah, that's a hard one.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
That is a hard one.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.760
I loved how we kind of made that transition from starting about Chrome and to getting

53:22.760 --> 53:26.360
to the broader conversation, but before we go any further, I want to talk about something

53:26.360 --> 53:28.360
that's broad, and that's DigitalOcean.

53:28.360 --> 53:32.560
Go over to DigitalOcean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUGED to get a $10 credit, and then

53:32.560 --> 53:36.040
you can try out their $5 rig, two months for free.

53:36.040 --> 53:37.040
Think about that.

53:37.040 --> 53:41.120
If you did that right now, you could try it out, and it would still be working in the

53:41.120 --> 53:43.600
future in 2016 for free.

53:43.600 --> 53:44.600
Whoa!

53:44.600 --> 53:45.600
That's right.

53:45.600 --> 53:48.840
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGED over at DigitalOcean.com, a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated

53:48.840 --> 53:52.880
to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to get a Linux rig up in the cloud,

53:52.880 --> 53:58.440
backed by KVM, using SSDs so that way the I.O. is super fast with crazy great connections

53:58.440 --> 54:04.560
in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Germany, and Toronto.

54:04.560 --> 54:07.040
Maybe you promised your niece a new Minecraft server.

54:07.040 --> 54:08.040
Spin it up.

54:08.040 --> 54:09.040
Dude.

54:09.040 --> 54:11.600
Maybe your new year's resolution was start a new blog.

54:11.600 --> 54:12.680
Holy smokes.

54:12.680 --> 54:14.000
Give the gift of Linux infrastructure.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
Holy smokes.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
Exactly.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGED.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.640
Actually, you know, I have a Minecraft server.

54:19.640 --> 54:20.640
Do you really?

54:20.640 --> 54:21.640
I do.

54:21.640 --> 54:22.640
I have a SyncThing server.

54:22.640 --> 54:23.800
I got an own cloud server.

54:23.800 --> 54:26.240
I got a STUN server up there.

54:26.240 --> 54:27.240
What else do I have up there?

54:27.240 --> 54:28.760
I have an MB server up there.

54:28.760 --> 54:32.600
I have a Quasal core server, a Quasal server up there.

54:32.600 --> 54:36.640
Of course, I have a web server that does a couple of just small tasks for me.

54:36.640 --> 54:38.520
I have a GPG server up there.

54:38.520 --> 54:40.960
I got all kinds of stuff up there on DigitalOcean.

54:40.960 --> 54:42.000
It is really great.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.520
Their interface is very intuitive, very straightforward.

54:44.520 --> 54:48.960
They have a great API that pushes that all the way into your hands, like you can just

54:48.960 --> 54:49.960
create a great script.

54:49.960 --> 54:54.320
There's a bunch of libraries that work with it or tons and tons of community apps that

54:54.320 --> 54:57.560
are open source and ready to take advantage of.

54:57.560 --> 55:03.200
Really great control panel, very reasonable cost, entire Linux infrastructure, HTML5 consoles

55:03.200 --> 55:06.920
to manage all of it, DOUNPLUGED is the promo code.

55:06.920 --> 55:10.960
DigitalOcean has been rocking support of this show for the entire 2015 year, and it would

55:10.960 --> 55:13.960
mean a lot to me if you went over there and used that promo code to keep our show going

55:13.960 --> 55:17.640
as a thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

55:17.640 --> 55:19.920
So DOUNPLUGED, that's all you got to do.

55:19.920 --> 55:22.040
Try them out for two months, absolutely free.

55:22.040 --> 55:27.120
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged show.

55:27.120 --> 55:30.120
DigitalOcean reminds me of the future, and something else that kind of felt like the

55:30.120 --> 55:35.440
future was our conversation around open source artificial intelligence and the Mycroft device.

55:35.440 --> 55:41.720
So in the pre-show, we were talking about this really cool Kickstarter called the Mycroft,

55:41.720 --> 55:48.560
and literally in between a few moments ago and now since we started the show, we've had

55:48.560 --> 55:51.640
somebody from the Kickstarter join us in the Mumble Room.

55:51.640 --> 55:55.960
I believe he's their Chief Technology Officer, so I want to bring him onto the show right

55:55.960 --> 55:56.960
now.

55:56.960 --> 55:58.760
Ryan, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

55:58.760 --> 55:59.760
Welcome back, I should say.

55:59.760 --> 56:01.480
Yeah, it's good to be back.

56:01.480 --> 56:03.560
I love this show so much.

56:03.560 --> 56:10.360
Okay, so Ryan, in your own words, what is the Mycroft device and what's your involvement

56:10.360 --> 56:12.300
with the project?

56:12.300 --> 56:16.640
So in my own words, have you ever wanted to walk into your house and have it be like you're

56:16.640 --> 56:18.800
on the Starship Enterprise?

56:18.800 --> 56:20.200
Yes, every day.

56:20.200 --> 56:21.960
Well this project allows you to do that.

56:21.960 --> 56:26.760
It's an artificial intelligence for controlling your entire home, from entertainment to your

56:26.760 --> 56:31.040
appliances to your lights to your music.

56:31.040 --> 56:35.720
Everything can run through Mycroft because it's powered by Linux.

56:35.720 --> 56:39.600
And how much of an infrastructure is there to just like, if I'm a consumer, if I had

56:39.600 --> 56:43.080
something like this, I set it up, put it on my table, am I ready to start using it or

56:43.080 --> 56:45.840
is it like I have to write the apps for it?

56:45.840 --> 56:47.840
Absolutely.

56:47.840 --> 56:52.240
You do not have to write anything if you don't want to.

56:52.240 --> 56:56.500
That's actually a lot of questions I've gotten is, okay, it's open source, drop the code

56:56.500 --> 56:57.860
on us right now.

56:57.860 --> 57:04.160
And we're like, no, we want to, but we are putting in place ways to easily manage it

57:04.160 --> 57:07.060
and contribute to the project.

57:07.060 --> 57:12.760
And before we ever started on this, we actually, this came out of a selfish endeavor.

57:12.760 --> 57:16.920
We wanted, we had this place, it's a maker space here in Lawrence, Kansas, and we wanted

57:16.920 --> 57:21.880
to power the whole place using an artificial intelligence.

57:21.880 --> 57:25.440
And so we went through all these different open source projects that were already out

57:25.440 --> 57:30.600
there, you know, this personal assistance type things, and none of them did what we

57:30.600 --> 57:31.600
wanted.

57:31.600 --> 57:32.600
We wanted to control the lights.

57:32.600 --> 57:37.880
We wanted to be able to add new modules and essentially make it power the entire space.

57:37.880 --> 57:43.280
And everything was limited or really hard to install or really hard to configure.

57:43.280 --> 57:47.880
And we were like, this is not a good shape for this to be in.

57:47.880 --> 57:52.560
I mean, we've already got things like Google Now and Siri and Echo coming out, and they're

57:52.560 --> 57:56.560
all super tied into their own ecosystems, they're proprietary.

57:56.560 --> 58:00.880
And we were like, this is something open source can actually do better, you know?

58:00.880 --> 58:05.680
And so a big differentiator here, and maybe also the biggest question mark is it's running

58:05.680 --> 58:13.680
a local AI, a local AI that seems to be powering a lot of the recognition and all of that.

58:13.680 --> 58:14.800
Is that all done locally?

58:14.800 --> 58:17.000
Is there no cloud component to this?

58:17.000 --> 58:21.320
There is a cloud component, and we've received a lot of questions about that.

58:21.320 --> 58:24.800
We use PocketSphinx for the keyword recognition.

58:24.800 --> 58:29.740
PocketSphinx is a local library that analyzes, you know, it doesn't go anywhere, it's just

58:29.740 --> 58:31.040
listening for its keyword.

58:31.040 --> 58:36.320
Until then, you can say anything, and it's not going anywhere, and that's good, because

58:36.320 --> 58:40.720
you don't want everything you say in your house to be streamed up to a server.

58:40.720 --> 58:44.640
Right, so the voice processing for the trigger words is done locally.

58:44.640 --> 58:51.040
Yeah, but at that point, we actually send it off to a few different places, and essentially

58:51.040 --> 58:57.320
whichever comes back first, we analyze it for quality, like how accurate do we think

58:57.320 --> 59:03.160
this is, and then, you know, depending on how accurate that first speech to text thing

59:03.160 --> 59:07.560
is, and we have our own ways of kind of figuring that out, we either accept it, or we wait

59:07.560 --> 59:12.200
for the next one to come in, and we're hoping that people will be able to make decisions

59:12.200 --> 59:18.360
for themselves, at least our technical users, for which services they want to use for analyzing,

59:18.360 --> 59:23.000
you know, the queries, and then go from there.

59:23.000 --> 59:27.440
The machine itself actually decides what to do with the query when it gets it back.

59:27.440 --> 59:32.120
So when it analyzes what you say, and this is really complicated, and I'm sorry, there's

59:32.120 --> 59:35.480
not really a great way to encapsulate this into an easy-sized thing to put.

59:35.480 --> 59:36.480
No, it's actually fascinating.

59:36.480 --> 59:41.080
So the decision, the action taken, isn't made up in the cloud service.

59:41.080 --> 59:44.200
The answer is provided to the local box, and that's where the decision is made on what

59:44.200 --> 59:45.200
to do.

59:45.200 --> 59:46.200
That's correct, that's correct.

59:46.200 --> 59:47.200
That's nice.

59:47.200 --> 59:52.220
It comes back with a confidence, it says this is what we think it said, and then the local

59:52.220 --> 59:57.200
machine goes through its modules very, very quickly to decide which one applies to that.

59:57.200 --> 01:00:02.960
So if Chris Fisher says, I want you to play the Deadpool trailer on my TV in the living

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:05.800
room, it's going to come back, it's going to look at the media module.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:09.600
The media module is going to say, I'm pretty sure he wants YouTube, then the YouTube module

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:14.300
is going to be activated, which is going to cast that to the Chromecast in your living

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.300
room TV.

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:16.300
Sure.

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.300
Huh.

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:21.620
That's pretty slick, and I guess the nice thing here is if this really, really reaches

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:25.980
its goal, regardless of how well the device does, there could be a significant contribution

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:28.060
by having this open source AI project.

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:30.000
So can you tell me more about that?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.420
Is it a server client thing?

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:32.860
Is it all open?

01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:34.500
Is there a proprietary aspect to it?

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:37.620
What's going on with this AI, and what's it called exactly?

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:40.300
So the AI itself is called Mycroft.

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:43.980
It's named after Mycroft Holmes, which is Sherlock Holmes' brother.

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:50.000
It's also, there's this book called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which has an artificial

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.540
intelligence in it named Mycroft.

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:57.420
And Mycroft is important because Mycroft, being Sherlock's home brother, was supposed

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:58.420
to be super intelligent.

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:02.540
He was supposed to be able to just, you know, he had an excellent memory, was able to just

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:05.620
pull information out of his head at a moment's notice.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.540
And so that's where the inspiration came from for the name.

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:15.340
The actual device itself is completely open, open hardware, open software, and the entire

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:19.660
unit and everything related to it is going to be open.

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:25.780
The only thing I can imagine maybe having some parts being held back would be some of

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:33.460
our backend infrastructure for, you know, like we want everything that comes through

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:36.480
our servers to be encrypted and anonymized.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:41.820
And so I don't know how much of our backend we're going to open source right away.

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:48.100
Being that your show actually was something that I grew with as I grew in my Linux abilities,

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:52.060
I started listening to it probably, oh God, like I don't want to guess how many years

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:54.860
ago.

01:01:54.860 --> 01:02:00.580
And so my goal is as a result of being kind of raised in this culture and having like

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:08.740
a lot of my tech knowledge grow with the open source community and my involvement in it,

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:14.900
I would eventually like to get everything that we create open sourced.

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:20.100
But there's also, we have to find the best way to do that and we have to do it at the

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:23.460
right time or else people will be like, this software is crap.

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:28.740
And so the way it interfaces with home automation devices, is that through like the APIs that

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:29.740
those vendors provide?

01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:34.460
Like so SmartThings Hub or Philips Hughes, that's essentially, it's just interfacing

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:36.660
with those APIs that exist out there already.

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.360
Yes, that's exactly right.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:43.500
Anything your Linux box can do, Mycroft can do because it's built on top of Raspberry

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:44.620
Pi.

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:50.900
And so anything you can run on a Linux box, the way that the modules are created is it

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:58.120
can just send off a command through the Raspberry Pi to a device.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:01.940
So how is that then, how is that done from the user?

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:05.100
How is that set up from a user perspective in a device that's all done with voice commands?

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:08.180
Is there some sort of web interface or how do you, I know it's getting down to the details,

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:12.280
I'm just curious, how does an end user do interface with something like this?

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.160
So there are two ways I see it.

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:21.900
There's the for grandma, you know, and then there's for someone like Chris Fisher.

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:28.300
And grandma will use an application to install modules that others have created.

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:33.180
And then when they're installed, like if she installs Pandora, it'll say on her phone or

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:38.900
on her computer, it will say, you know, log in, okay, we've imported your stations, you

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:43.420
know, and then and it'll say, would you like to create custom names for these stations,

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.420
you know, beyond their normal name.

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:53.820
So if you say, play my jam, it will go directly to the station you've designated as my jam.

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:59.140
But for Chris Fisher, you might want to actually create a module that does something related

01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.580
to your studio over there.

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:07.760
And the way that that works is you can create a module and install it locally on your machine

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.300
just by logging into your machine.

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:14.340
And then if you want to contribute it back to the community, you can and we'll have a

01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:18.700
community repo where people can contribute their own modules back.

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:23.640
We at the makerspace, we have a whole bunch of drones, and we fly them.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:27.720
And we've also got them so we can design flight paths for them.

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:31.320
And so right now we're working on a module where we say Mycroft launched the drone to

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:36.140
do a perimeter check, and he goes on a predefined flight path.

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:43.420
And so that's the point, though, is I was getting very upset that I could get an Echo

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:47.140
or one of these other devices in my house, but I would have no control over what services

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:48.660
I could use with it.

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:51.260
It'd be whatever Amazon told me I could use.

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:52.940
And that's where I think the big difference is.

01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:54.580
People are like, I don't understand what's different.

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:58.660
And it's like, well, if you get an Amazon Echo, Amazon is going to control every single

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.300
thing that can interface with.

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:07.660
Because they're proprietary, because they're this ecosystem that's going to put their

01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:13.920
own products and services ahead of others, that's something you don't run into with Mycroft,

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.860
because Mycroft is open.

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:20.680
And we're not going to prioritize anybody because frankly, we can't.

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.680
People will be able to install whatever modules they want when we don't want to limit what

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.740
they can install on their own device.

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:32.460
$99,000, is that enough to build an open source artificial intelligence and manufacture and

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:35.500
ship units like this out to customers?

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.940
So that's a really good question.

01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:42.740
The $99,000, so we've already bankrolled this a lot.

01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:47.880
We come from a background of most of the people on the team, this isn't their first rodeo,

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:50.020
this isn't their first company.

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:56.540
And our CEO, Joshua Montgomery, has been featured in Ars Technica and a few other big online

01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:02.260
publications for his work on the Wicked Fiber Initiative in Lawrence, Kansas, to get one

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:07.300
gigabit internet service to everybody in the town.

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:14.220
And so we've had experience, and we all come from different backgrounds and maybe in different

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:18.040
companies that we've played a role in starting and everything.

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:23.980
What this says, $99,000, yes, will allow us to ship our first units.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:25.580
That would be great.

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:32.700
But it will also allow us to be able to have that reassurance that we're doing something

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:40.300
that people want, and we're ready to invest more in it because of that.

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:46.180
We think that, first off, we have a little bit of funds that we're willing to pour into

01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:53.660
the project if we know that there's some actual desire for a product like this.

01:06:53.660 --> 01:07:01.740
And secondly, if we actually do fund, that allows us to go to investors and say, hey,

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:07.520
we want to take this to the next level, and here's the interest and everything.

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:15.180
But I would love to see us beat our Kickstarter goal and have enough resources to actually

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:22.920
completely fund this from our fans and not have to go to investors if we don't have to.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:27.980
But we've already planned for the next step in the event that we fund, and everybody will

01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:34.060
be able to get their unit and will be in pretty decent shape for a good long time.

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:40.140
So I would say if something like this interests you, head over there and back it.

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.580
And if you have any questions, hit us up.

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.040
You can message us on Kickstarter.

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:49.860
I'm in the chat occasionally, but you can also find me on Google Plus and Twitter, at

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:52.940
ryanleesipes, and just ask me a question.

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:59.300
I had a chance to chat with Ryan at System76 when I went out there, and they are extremely

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:01.040
passionate about what they're trying to do.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:05.900
And what I love about Ryan is he's really got a good handle on the big picture, the

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:08.300
big picture of where they could take this thing.

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:14.540
I don't know where that is yet, but man, his example in our interview where he talked about

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:19.380
they have Mycroft hooked up to a drone, and they just say drone, or they just say Mycroft,

01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:23.620
scan the premises, and Mycroft launches a drone, and it goes around and takes surveillance

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.660
of the premises and gives them a report.

01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:26.660
That is amazing.

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:27.660
Yes, that is.

01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:31.140
If you're not feeling safe at home tonight, tell the Mycroft device to go out and do it.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.460
And you can audit that, right?

01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:36.740
I mean, it's not just some drone that's watching everything and you have no idea how it's processing,

01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:38.100
where it's sending that.

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.100
This is your drone.

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:40.100
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:45.580
And of course, with all the other commercial artificial intelligence help out there, it's

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:50.300
nice to have something that's open source and something that uses code to locally listen

01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:51.580
that we can trust.

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:57.040
I want to shift gears now and talk about something that was a big revelation for Noah and I.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:02.100
We went down to LinuxCon, aka DockerCon this year, and one of the things we walked away

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:08.740
with was Docker and containers on Linux is really what the enterprise is talking about,

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:12.860
but more so than that, how they can actually manage it once they've deployed hundreds

01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:16.020
of Docker containers that they don't have such a handle on.

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:19.980
Now, Noah, one of the things that jumped out at me about that talk, and he's talking about

01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:26.060
security, is one of the main things that the vendors here are showcasing is how to patch

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:29.660
your applications in containers.

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:33.860
Everybody has a different solution for that, how to manage container security, how to update

01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:37.580
applications in containers, how to know when the applications in the containers have gone

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:44.180
behind, how to know when the application quits working, all of that is, I would say, and

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.660
maybe, do you agree that it seems to be the number one product that's being talked about

01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:50.660
here, the number one problem?

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:56.820
The container technologies themselves, we've built communities and there's already that,

01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:59.860
the standards exist for that, right?

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:04.580
What's left, where the market is, where there's left to make a business or money is in products

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:08.180
managing those things, because like we were talking about at the drive, is you're not

01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:14.540
going to, nobody is going to manage that stuff from the command line, even if it's possible,

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:17.460
so you need some sort of a solution, especially if you're doing it at a scale.

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:22.020
Yeah, and the other thing is containers kind of encourage you to have a lot of them, because

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:27.020
not only is your density higher versus virtualization, so on a server that could have 10 virtual

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:31.260
machines, maybe you can now have 20 containers, because you don't have the emulation overhead,

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:35.340
but you also are kind of encouraged to do a container per application, so you put your

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:40.480
mail server in a container, and your web server in a container, and your group collaboration

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:43.460
thing in it, all these different things go in containers, all of a sudden you have a

01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:47.180
dozen containers for one small office, and so one of the things that they're finding

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:51.420
and talking about here is that container proliferation is just exploding, and then even small shops

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:54.340
have all of these containers they have to manage, and then the other thing they want

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:57.100
to do is move them between services, depending on which one is more cost effective.

01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:01.180
Now the next thing we're going to get into is a clip that perfectly demonstrates, as

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:06.060
commercial software moves into areas that are more and more and more important to our

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:11.020
daily lives, it is becoming more critical than ever that we as consumers can crack it

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:13.020
open and take a look at it.

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:17.580
I think this next story and this clip and discussion we had perfectly demonstrates this,

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:21.320
and not only does it demonstrate this, but we managed to also demonstrate why the discussion

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.900
around DRM can still happen, and it can have a new spin, but first I want to tell you about

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:27.780
our friends over at Linux Academy.

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:32.180

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.380
You hear that airplane out there, Wes?

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:19.380
I sure do.

01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:20.660
You hear that airplane flying over?

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:23.820
Those are people that are celebrating their successes by Linux Academy.

01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:26.140
They're just flying around in the Linux Academy jet.

01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:27.620
Okay, well that's not true.

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:28.860
But it might be true.

01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:30.220
It could be Santa's sleigh.

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:32.820
Oh, but you know, it's got to be Linux powered.

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:35.220
How else could it be so reliable?

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:36.220
I agree.

01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:37.220
And you know what?

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:39.300
When those reindeers had to build a Linux powered sled, do you know where they learned

01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:40.300
their Linux fundamentals?

01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:41.300
Linux Academy.

01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:42.300
Linux Academy.

01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:46.180
They went to LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged and they got that reindeer discount and you

01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:48.540
can too, and you support the show.

01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:52.580
And it's seriously becoming very respected, you know, like you see someone and they completed

01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:56.260
a lot of Linux Academy courses, you know that they know what they're talking about.

01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:57.260
Yeah.

01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:00.460
That is a very good point is because they've been so focused on the content and on the

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:03.980
infrastructure on the course where they pick and they managed to watch the industry and

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:05.860
determine what stuff really matters.

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:10.920
They've gotten a really good name for themselves and that just pays dividends as a Linux Academy

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:11.920
subscriber.

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:15.520
So go to LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged, take advantage of our discount and tell them

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:23.700
you appreciate them supporting the show for all of 2015, LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:24.700
Thank you Linux Academy.

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:25.700
All right.

01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:30.780
So let's talk about this VW scandal where you hooked up the VW cars to get tested and

01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:35.500
the computer software made things look a little better than they really were.

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.540
And that is where the problem lies.

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:41.660
Volkswagen cheated on emissions tests again, says the EPA.

01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:48.380
This time about 10,000 VW, Porsche and Audi diesel engine cars are implicated.

01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:53.380
They're all installed with software that makes the cars emit less pollution during tests.

01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:59.340
When driving on real roads, the cars emit nine times the legal limit of nitrogen oxide.

01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:03.620
So this software, I'm going to stop it right there, this software is specifically designed

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:09.580
by Volkswagen that when it is in test mode, it alters the way the engine performs.

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:14.220
And when you're not in test mode, nine times of some of the most poisonous types of gases

01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:16.580
come out of the tailpipe of these diesel vehicles.

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:19.260
Which causes respiratory problems.

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:24.420
In September, emissions cheating was exposed in 11 million other VW cars worldwide.

01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:29.260
None of the cars have been recalled in the US and are still safe to drive.

01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:34.980
The company could owe the EPA billions of dollars in fines, including nearly 400 million

01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:39.260
associated with the latest batch of cars.

01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:46.540
The latest batch of cars includes Porsches, Audis, we're talking high end vehicles.

01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:54.180
And this has caused the mainstream press like Cars.com and the New York Times and a bunch

01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:59.180
of others that are running pieces that are basically saying that proprietary software

01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:00.180
is the blame.

01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:05.420
They say outright fraud is possible because of proprietary software.

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:07.540
And I think this is remarkable.

01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:10.060
They say it's a bad situation to get far, far worse.

01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:13.420
You throw a perfectly good phone away after two or three years because the components

01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:14.560
goes bad.

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.380
But because the manufacturer refuses to provide parts and code updates, really, as the driver

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:24.860
of an old but beloved car that owns its latest 50,000 miles to the abilities of mechanics

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:31.880
who understand the engine's technology, which is a huge great point by the way, they go

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:35.360
on to point out that a day is coming when great cars get scrapped because the automaker

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:39.880
decided it was time to force me to buy a new one.

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.340
This is Andy Inocco writing for Cars.com.

01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:44.500
In that same report, you know, he touches on the same thing we were talking about the

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:49.820
other week, you know, with Apple users not owning their software, only licensing it.

01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:52.820
Here we see that more and more corporate companies, in this case, General Motors, lawyers have

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:56.320
defended the practice that you don't own the General Motors software in your car.

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.320
They do.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.320
Yeah.

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.540
You have no right to play with it or tinker it or make sure that it's not polluting more

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:01.540
than you think.

01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:02.540
Right.

01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:04.960
Nine times more than they say it is.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:08.900
You go in to get it tested, and it's then polluting nine times more than you thought

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:09.900
it was.

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:10.900
You go in to get it tested.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:11.900
Yep.

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.960
I hope they're revising the tests here as well.

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:16.620
Maybe something you stick in the tailpipe while it drives around.

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:17.620
Pronoun.

01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:19.740
You had a comment about proprietary software by law.

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:20.740
Go ahead.

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:21.740
Yes.

01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:29.980
I think some law entity in Europe actually had a law that you have to put proprietary

01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:33.100
software on cars so they can't be hacked.

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.620
Huh.

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:40.420
That is horrible, and obviously, this would be an underscoring reason why that would be

01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:41.420
a bad idea.

01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:46.980
Wimpy, what do you have here from the podcast on season eight, episode 34 of the Ubuntu

01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:47.980
podcast?

01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:48.980
Sorry.

01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:49.980
That was the wrong link.

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:50.980
Oh.

01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:51.980
That's the one after that about the Librarian of Congress.

01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:52.980
Oh, yes.

01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:53.980
Yeah.

01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:54.980
From the EFF.

01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:55.980
Yes.

01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:56.980
Actually, this is kind of where it's going.

01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:57.980
We kind of touched on this last week.

01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:58.980
Yeah.

01:16:58.980 --> 01:16:59.980
Good point.

01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:03.220
But there's a particular point in there about how this affects car security, research, repair

01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:04.220
and modification.

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:06.700
What did you catch?

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:10.340
That they've recognized the need for vehicle owners to circumvent access restrictions in

01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:12.100
order to repair, modify and tinker.

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:13.100
Yeah.

01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:18.100
And one of the things in this VW case is that you're not able to actually determine what

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:25.820
the proprietary software is doing or not doing with regard to these test emission levels

01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:31.780
and how the car is being tuned is because it's DRM protected and because of the DMCA,

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:34.580
you're not allowed to hack it.

01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:36.540
But under this provision, you now are.

01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:37.540
This is a big deal.

01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:38.540
Yeah.

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:39.540
This is a really big deal.

01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:45.980
And it is the Librarian of Congress has extended this DMCA, I guess, exemption to also phones

01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:47.620
and tablets too.

01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:52.660
And I wonder if this whole Volkswagen catastrophe isn't partly responsible for this.

01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:55.920
It seems to be turning the tide in at least some of the public perception.

01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:01.300
So here is now, I don't want to be like this guy, but I just want to put this out there.

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:03.560
So let's be realistic.

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.460
The industry is what it is.

01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:09.300
They're not going to be, it's not going to be Kumbaya, open source, blah, blah, blah.

01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:13.700
It's going to be at best people reverse engineering and figuring things out.

01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:18.940
This software, this stuff is literally going to affect our lives.

01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:22.380
It is the stuff that runs our cars, the stuff that runs the trains, the stuff that runs

01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:26.100
the drones, the stuff that runs all of this.

01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:34.780
Chris, just imagine for a second if SIZA or TTPIP or the TTP was in full effect.

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:40.580
The person that would have found this bug in the Volkswagen software would be going

01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:41.580
to jail.

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:42.580
Right.

01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:46.420
And, North Ranger, you also kind of wanted to play on that, on the DMCA laws.

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:47.420
Well, yeah.

01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:54.660
I mean, what Wimpy pointed out with the exemption granted by the US Librarian of Congress still

01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:57.500
doesn't fix, I wouldn't call it a loophole.

01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:03.440
It's a big catch with the DMCA is that the Library of Congress exemption only allows

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:13.800
individuals to bypass circumvention and things like cars and video games with servers.

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:17.740
It's still a criminal act to distribute tools to break those.

01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:18.740
Right.

01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:19.740
That's a good point.

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:24.100
Wimpy actually has a really good point about how this could be a great opportunity to explain

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:28.420
it to regular users about why DRM and DMCA stuff is so bad.

01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:29.420
Go ahead, Wimpy.

01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:35.220
Well, you know, normally we associate DRM with content, and if you try and explain why DRM

01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:41.100
is bad, because it protects video or music content to, you know, your friends and family

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:44.780
outside of the open source world, that's a difficult sell.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:50.820
But if you explain this story, that the software, automated software, is DRM protected and may

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:56.180
be tuning the car differently for its test cycle than when it's on the road.

01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:59.000
But nobody can prove that because it's DRM protected.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.100
It's a better way to explain why DRM is a bad thing.

01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:03.100
We shouldn't have it.

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:06.340
Now that we're sitting here at the end of the year, this scandal's actually gotten even

01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:07.340
worse.

01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:08.340
More vehicles are impacted.

01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:10.420
And, Popey, you were saying you had some thoughts on this.

01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:12.700
I'm curious what you think now looking back at it.

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:17.900
Yeah, right back when it came out, there was a lot of thought.

01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:25.140
It felt like the American system was looking at European cars and casting aspersions on

01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:27.820
these horrible European cars.

01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:32.260
And I was pretty certain back then that other manufacturers will be hauled over the coals

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:33.260
as well.

01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:34.780
And that's turned out to be the case.

01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:39.140
And it's a much wider problem than just Volkswagen.

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:43.420
And I think people are more cognizant of relying on testing in general.

01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:47.620
And I think things outside the motor industry are starting to be scrutinized a little bit

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:48.620
more.

01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:57.820
And there's been reports of airlines who are reporting certain levels of efficiency

01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:59.820
that aren't actually true either.

01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:05.740
So I think this has triggered in people's minds that you can't just believe the very

01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:08.380
strict test case that was done in the laboratory.

01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:11.840
And actually, there are real world scenarios that you need to think about as well.

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:16.540
And I think it's also there is a good discussion happening now around if software is going

01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:22.580
to be in these machines that are so important to our daily lives, is there a reasonable

01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:26.120
expectation that I can pull it apart and look at it and audit it?

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:30.560
And that conversation isn't very strong, and it hasn't gone very far, but at least it's

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:31.560
happening.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:35.240
I think it's tied into, like we saw this year, the Linux Foundation is now backing the real

01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:36.240
time kernel.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:40.380
Like before, where things like BlackBerry's QNX were kind of dominant in the automotive

01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:44.020
scene, hopefully we'll see more things where you could reasonably build the stack that

01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:47.140
Volkswagen uses and do some tests before you even saw it.

01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:48.140
Oh, exactly.

01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:49.140
That's a great point.

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:50.140
Bobby, were you going to?

01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:51.140
Yeah.

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:55.060
Yeah, there's a popular talk that Karen Sandler, who used to be on the Nome Foundation, I think

01:21:55.060 --> 01:22:02.300
she's now works at the Software Freedom Conservancy, where she gives a keynote about the fact that

01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:04.100
she's got a pacemaker.

01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:09.780
And when it was to be installed, she asked, can I see the software?

01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:14.340
And the surgeons and doctors had never been asked that question before.

01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:15.340
And it's very similar.

01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:22.740
There's a device that is keeping her alive, this could potentially be non-free software,

01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:27.280
in the same way that you're cruising down the motorway at 90 miles an hour or whatever.

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:33.060
And there's a piece of software inside that car that's preventing the car from just veering

01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:38.760
off the road and slamming into the wall.

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:43.500
There is an expectation that we should be able to look at that code and that hasn't

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.740
quite reached those engineers yet, I don't think.

01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:47.740
Yeah.

01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:48.740
That is a good point.

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:51.340
And maybe that'll change over time.

01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:58.860
And maybe those companies now that are creating that software will be minimized by other offerings

01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:03.360
by platforms out there that they just become the hardware maker and somebody else becomes

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.360
the software provider.

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:07.220
And I think it's just very early days.

01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:08.220
It is.

01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:12.980
And we're watching it now because I think that we have an important view on this particular

01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:13.980
topic.

01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:17.140
So I think 2016 is going to be even more revealing on this.

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:18.140
Stay tuned to Linux Unplugged.

01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:19.140
Yeah, right?

01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:20.140
Yes.

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:21.140
Snappy for pacemakers.

01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:22.140
You heard it here first.

01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:23.140
Exactly.

01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:27.620
I mean, you joke, but Snappy is legitimately a serious solution to this problem we talk

01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:31.820
about constantly on TechSnap and that is how are you going to make sure that these are

01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:36.660
not home router 2.0 where they just – you get these old Linux running devices out there

01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:42.820
that never get patches and now you have things like universally UNPMP is vulnerable on all

01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:43.820
these devices.

01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:46.220
Snappy has a reasonable answer to that.

01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:51.100
And I wonder if through 2016 if we won't see that pick up and see more and more adoption

01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:54.220
there because it's a damn good solution.

01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:55.740
If I don't say so myself.

01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:57.680
If I don't say so myself.

01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:01.300
So yeah, the VW scandal stuff, I think it was interesting talking about VW but like

01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:05.780
Pope said, it turns out it's applicable to a lot more people and it really is more

01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:09.700
about the broader conversation around that software being locked away.

01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:10.700
Audibility in general.

01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:15.460
And I also liked our conversation around DRM that came out of that.

01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:19.700
Before we get into the rest of the clips and the next one we're going to talk about is

01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:20.940
OpenSUSE Leap.

01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:26.780
OpenSUSE made major transformations this year and it was nice to have R. Brown, the chairman

01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:31.860
of SUSE to stop by and chat with us about it because I mean talk about the horse's

01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:32.860
mouth, right?

01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:35.820
But because they've been going through so many changes it was particularly appreciated

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:38.500
so we're going to get to that here in just a second but first I want to tell you about

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:39.860
our friends over at Ting.

01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:47.380
I don't know if I'm there yet but my goodness, I'm closing in on my third year of Ting service.

01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:48.380
Wowee.

01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:49.540
Holy smokes.

01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:50.740
And you can get in on it too.

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:53.560
Go to linux.ting.com.

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:57.380
First of all, you get to type Linux in your history bar which looks way better than Red

01:24:57.380 --> 01:25:01.060
Tube, let's be honest, so linux.ting.com but even better than that.

01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:04.920
That let's Ting know you heard about it here on the Unplugged show and you support this

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:05.920
show.

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:07.900
You get to find out a little more and they have a savings calculator.

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:11.100
I invite you to click that and see how much you would save.

01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:15.200
Put your actual usage in there, linux.ting.com.

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:18.960
Go there, try it out, get the $25 discount off your first device or if you have a Ting

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:21.240
compatible device and you might.

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:22.240
You probably do.

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:25.400
You get GSM, if you've got GSM and CDMA Network so you've got a lot of choices.

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:28.880
If you have a compatible device you'll get $25 of service credit which paid for more

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:30.040
than my first month.

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:33.280
They have an early termination relief program so they'll help you get out of a contract

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.340
if a duopoly talks you into that.

01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:41.080
That's really, really nice and you know I was over at the Ting site, Wes look at this

01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:42.400
freaking deal.

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:49.040
The OG Nexus 5, $190, $190, no contract.

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:53.600
You get the Google experience, no contract, it's not locked, you have full access to it,

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:55.400
they don't get in the way of any updates.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.560
Yep, exactly.

01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:59.520
You get those Google updates right there on the phone, $190.

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.920
Bootloader unlocked.

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:02.420
Pay for what you use.

01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:07.000
It's just flat $6 for the phone and then it's your minutes, your messages and your megabytes.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.080
If you're Wi-Fi savvy, this is a crazy deal.

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.920
I've got three phones, I'm paying like $40, $45 a month.

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:12.920
See that's great.

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:16.460
Like personally, I'm lucky enough that my employer, they're willing to pay a certain

01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:19.200
amount of my cell phone fee so that they can call me, right?

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.960
And I think a lot of people are in that position.

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:22.080
Ting is great for that.

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:25.960
Like I have a set amount, how am I going to go over that amount on Ting, right?

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:27.920
That means my cell phone plan is covered.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:28.920
So you're making money on the deal sometimes.

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:29.920
Yeah, exactly.

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:32.840
That's really clever, Wes.

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:33.840
And thanks to Ting.

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:38.640
Yeah, linux.ting.com to support this show and get on the deal with a ton of good devices.

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:42.160
Everything from just like a bare bones GSM card and feature phone all the way up to the

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:47.440
latest and greatest Android devices and internet phone devices from Apple.

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:51.920
Try out that savings calculator, plug in your usage, see how much you would actually save

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.960
and then realize you now have the flexibility of choosing GSM or CDMA whenever you want

01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.400
like a boost.

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:01.120
linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com.

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:07.440
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged Show all year long, linux.ting.com.

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:10.320
And thanks to you guys for going there and keeping us going.

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:16.920
All right, so let's get into our conversation about OpenSUSE Leap with Mr. Aaron Brown.

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:22.720
All right, well, I am really pumped about episode 118 today because we have a ton of

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:25.800
topics to cover, a lot of distro things to discuss.

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:31.280
So let's kick off the distro things with one Richard Brown, OpenSUSE's, or I believe,

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.280
SUSE's chairman.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:37.280
I forget, it was a very, it was a very, very cool title, the chairman of OpenSUSE, Mr.

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.280
Richard Brown.

01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.280
Please tell us more.

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.280
Mr. Brown, welcome to the show.

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:41.280
Thank you very much.

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:48.360
Yeah, and it's chairman of OpenSUSE, but SUSE paid for me my salary, so I work for both.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:54.120
So technically the SUSE company pays your paycheck, but you're the chairman of the OpenSUSE

01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:58.880
distribution, which honestly is way cooler than CEO or any other title.

01:27:58.880 --> 01:27:59.880
Definitely.

01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:01.000
Chairman is awesome.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.120
So Richard, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:13.200
And today is a pretty cool week because OpenSUSE 42.1 Leap shipped, and it's like Linux, but

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.080
not like we've seen it before.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:18.560
Are you guys totally pumped over there at OpenSUSE right now?

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:21.160
Yeah, and the feedback's been amazing.

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:25.200
I mean, we're trying something really different here for people who don't know.

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:30.960
We've got effectively the code base from SUSE Linux Enterprise, so the enterprise distribution.

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:36.200
And we started with that, but then rather than just copying it and shipping that as

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:41.360
our own, we've built a whole new platform on top of it.

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:46.720
And this is something that we've almost, as Linux users, have fantasized about, and it

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:48.640
almost seems impossible.

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:54.800
And it is this idea that you take the core Linux OS, and you make it stable, you make

01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:56.760
it secure, you make it predictable.

01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:02.200
But then as an end user, you get all of the trappings of nice updated end user applications

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:03.200
and things like that.

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.200
You can get the latest things that are important to you still.

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.600
Yeah, you know, the small things.

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:08.000
Like that kernel or X breaking.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.320
Yeah, things like Thunderbird, Chrome, your Steam packages, things like that.

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:21.360
And now, that is one thing to say is actually going to happen, but what is the long-term

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.800
plan to actually deliver on that?

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:29.720
How does OpenSUSE Elite plan to actually make that happen?

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:34.400
Well, part of it's all thanks to the tooling we already have, so things like the build

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:40.200
service, which make it really easy for us to do this kind of heavy, tricky engineering.

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:45.320
So the trick going forward is we're going to do LEAP minor releases aligned with the

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:46.440
SLE service pack.

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:49.480
So as they move forward, we'll move forward.

01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:54.480
And for each of those minor releases, which are expected about once per year, I expect

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:59.040
to see most of that user space stuff kind of jumping up, catching up with what's common

01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:03.920
standard there, with SUSE taking care of the base system underneath as part of the enterprise

01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:04.920
stuff.

01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:10.440
Now, Richard, what happens when something comes along that says, this is the new standard,

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:14.720
this is something we want to do, and it requires X, Y, Z be updated?

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:19.720
Is there a process in which a maintainer can step up and say, I'm going to make sure that

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:24.960
these libraries and this end user package are the latest version, even though it doesn't

01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:27.400
quite track what Sless is doing?

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:28.400
Exactly.

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:31.720
I mean, that's happened a few times already with this version of LEAP.

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:35.600
We actually did it with the kernel as well, so we had a real big bit of community feedback

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:40.440
that they wanted the 4.1 kernel in there, something newer than what SLE has.

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:42.720
So yeah, we've done that already.

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:48.880
I expect to probably hit a few more things again with 42.2, but also we're seeing on

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:53.880
the enterprise side, because we're doing this, they're a little bit braver about some other

01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:55.960
stuff they're talking about for service pack 2.

01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:56.960
That's awesome.

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:00.760
They might be moving a little bit faster, we might have a little bit less of that kind

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:05.520
of thing to hit than we were expecting when we started this a year ago.

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:08.840
So far, I've mostly talked about this in the context of the desktop and why it seems compelling

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:17.040
to me as a desktop distribution, but is there also a bit of a server answer here?

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:22.240
Could this be maybe somebody who wants to have some fairly modern, up-to-date, front-end

01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:28.480
packages of things like maybe SyncThing, Plex, MB, stuff like that, but then also have something

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:32.400
that doesn't have a ton of kernel changes and whatnot.

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:38.400
Do you see a role for OpenSUSE Leap in the server position, or is that clearly still

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:39.400
defined for SLES?

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:40.400
What's your thoughts there?

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:41.400
Definitely, totally, yes.

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:46.680
I mean, as part of this release, we actually tidied up all of the server patterns and installation

01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:49.880
options we have in Leap so that they're a lot more straightforward and easier to get

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:50.880
done.

01:31:50.880 --> 01:32:00.440
I mean, there's a big server market out there that doesn't really fit Sleep, so there's

01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:03.360
not really too much concern from the SUSE business side.

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:07.840
We're going a different direction, we're going to appeal to a different audience, so yeah,

01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:09.880
we're looking forward to seeing how that works out.

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:13.480
One of the things that I think I've noticed that Ubuntu has had to figure out with their

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:19.760
LTS releases, and I think they've done it pretty gracefully, is the updates to the kernel

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:23.360
to do hardware enablements, as they call them.

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:30.600
One of the things that I hear consistently, Richard, is, and it happens about right now,

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:35.440
and Wes knows what I'm about to say, is Ubuntu 14.04 is starting to feel real old, and he

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:39.360
and I know of a couple of examples of people who wanted to go with the LTS release but

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:44.680
bailed because it's just simply too out of date now.

01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:51.880
It seems like the LTS updates to Ubuntu and the service packs are on about the same schedule,

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:57.700
so how can Leap avoid this problem where some of the base system starts to become, honestly,

01:32:57.700 --> 01:33:03.840
a little stale, and so things like Steam games start to suffer, or new hardware support,

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:08.600
or honestly, even things like installing the latest versions of Java and Flash to play

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:13.120
Minecraft and do Hangouts become complicated?

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:15.440
What's Leap's solution to that?

01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:21.280
Well, the SLE service pack thing is moving up to about an annual release schedule now,

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:25.740
and hardware enablement is a big part of what SUSE do in those service packs.

01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:31.020
So we'll be benefiting from that, plus probably doing some of our own as well for the specific

01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:32.720
hardware that our community's interested in.

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:38.280
So yeah, that should kind of be the bread and butter that every year when we do a minor

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:42.280
release of Leap, hardware enablement should be there every time, keeping this whole thing

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:43.280
fresh.

01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:47.600
And would that be when I get, say, a new version of GTK, or would that come at a different

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:51.000
point in the update cycle?

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.440
We're really expecting kind of the big things like a new NUM release, a new KDE release

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:58.720
to be sort of synchronized all around those annual service packs we're going to be doing,

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:00.120
minor releases, as we're saying for Leap.

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:06.200
So essentially I get one new version of GTK a year, one new version of QT a year, and

01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:07.760
those kinds of things?

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:13.360
Yeah, the open SUSE packaging policy isn't necessarily that strict, so if there's a nice

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:17.080
compelling reason for us to push that out as a maintenance update during the life cycle

01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:22.680
of 42.1, we can, we might, but there has to be a reason because the last thing we want

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:25.280
to do is break things.

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:33.880
Now down the road, in all intents and purposes, is there going to be a 42.2 and a 42.3, or

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:39.140
is this essentially a continuously updating installation that I'm going to have that will

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:44.280
never, that's always just going to, like 42.1 is always going to be the latest, and whenever

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:46.080
you install it's just going to continually be updated.

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.680
How does this work and what is my upgrade path long term?

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:50.240
I don't know.

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:53.360
If you want a nice rolling release, that's what we have Tumbleweed for, so that's your

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:56.160
single installation that you can upgrade.

01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:00.180
So 42.1 will have 42.2 next year.

01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:05.640
The upgrade path will be as simple as a zippered up, so our equivalent of an apt distribution

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:06.640
upgrade.

01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:09.400
And so we're expecting that to be nice and simple.

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:13.400
You can also do it offline if you feel like doing it the old fashioned way over a USB

01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:14.400
stick or a DVD.

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:15.400
That's good.

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:21.840
Yeah, and so yeah, we're expecting these to do one of these service packs every year.

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:28.360
Then when SLEE, do SLEE 13 a few years from now, that's when we're expecting 43.0, which

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:34.960
will be sort of a big, huge change everything, probably based on wherever Tumbleweed is around

01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:35.960
about that time.

01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:36.960
Okay.

01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:41.040
So that'll be in line with what Suse is doing with the big enterprise release then as well.

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:44.360
This sounds like it's, the way you describe it, it's kind of a unique little space in

01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:45.360
the Linux ecosystem.

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:46.360
Yeah, it does seem different.

01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:52.200
And I look at this and I ask, so I guess Richard, my next question would be if I'm Frank from

01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:59.000
own cloud or if I'm somebody who's making say a Telegram server replacement or maybe

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:04.960
Plex or whatever, if I'm creating software for the Linux server or the Linux desktop,

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:11.640
how do I as a software vendor say we are compatible with XYZ version of OpenSUSE Leap?

01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:17.120
How can I clearly differentiate for the end user so that way they know it's going to work

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:19.120
on Leap or not?

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:23.960
Because the reason I ask you is because it seems like one, two years down the road there

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:29.080
could be some installations of Leap where something does work and some installations

01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:30.400
of Leap where things don't work.

01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:34.440
So what's kind of the thoughts there to make it clear to end users if you know something's

01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:39.080
going to work on your version of OpenSUSE to say nine months from now?

01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:43.120
The cleanest, simplest way would be I'd recommend that all of these vendors, like we're already

01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:48.160
in discussion for example with own cloud about doing this, of either put your stuff in our

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:54.480
distribution or use the build service where building it for whatever variation someone

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:56.840
might have is just a button click away.

01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:57.840
Nice.

01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:02.080
Because we're not expecting any major heavy architectural stuff so if you want to be extra

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:07.360
sure that the thing is built for every variation of Leap, that should just be nice and simply

01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:08.360
done in the OBS.

01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:12.480
Wouldn't that be great if we could get just everybody using that?

01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:13.720
That would be really something.

01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:17.600
So if you don't mind, Richard, I would love to shift gears for just a second and talk

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:20.880
about – well, for a few seconds and talk about Tumbleweed.

01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:26.760
So what is – if I'm looking at really – today and really – and let's talk

01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:27.760
about 2016 too.

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:31.720
I'm looking at my options as an OpenSUSE user and I'm looking at Tumbleweed it seems

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:33.000
like and I'm looking at Leap.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.240
I've got two different things in front of me.

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:40.600
I feel like maybe because I'm an Arch user today, if I was going to make a switch to

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:45.400
SUSE, maybe I want to go Tumbleweed and I actually kind of want to ask you straight

01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:51.080
up why would I not go Tumbleweed and why would I go Leap?

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:52.360
What's the downside to going Tumbleweed?

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:57.760
If there's two different versions of SUSE, what is Leap giving me that say Tumbleweed

01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:58.760
isn't?

01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:01.520
Leap is giving you a slower pace of change.

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:04.600
It's really down to what Linux is comfortable for you.

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:08.440
The thing we find with Tumbleweed is we've tackled those technical problems.

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:09.440
It's stable.

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:10.440
It works.

01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:11.440
You can rely on it.

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:14.920
But it's changing at whatever the pace upstreams are and we have feedback from our users saying

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:18.920
like I didn't want to relearn my entire workflow this week.

01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:25.400
So Tumbleweed, if you're one of these guys who likes whatever upstreams are doing, Tumbleweed

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:26.400
is fine.

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.400
Great.

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:28.400
Use it.

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:32.280
But at the same time, in certain use cases or just depending on how you are, you want

01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:34.160
something that changes less often.

01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:41.200
That's what Leap is going for as the two complementary approaches really.

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:45.840
And also maybe if I was the administrator of a couple of SUSE Enterprise Linux servers.

01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:46.840
Or even more than a couple.

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:47.840
Yeah.

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:49.560
Leap would probably be a pretty good desktop for me.

01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:54.600
We had a lot of people in our virtual log try out Leap after that episode and Tyler's

01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:56.280
here and he had installed.

01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:59.120
And Tyler, I'm kind of curious now looking back on it, how's your experience been?

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:04.640
So far I installed it last month, not long after it came out, upgraded from 13.2.

01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:07.800
First couple of weeks, the experience was a little bit rough on the edges.

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:11.000
I was trying to reinstall everything I had before.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.600
But I think now that I've had it for about a month and a half now, it's rock solid.

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:17.600
Rock solid.

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:18.600
That's a bold statement.

01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:19.600
Nice.

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:20.600
Good to hear that.

01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:21.600
I'm curious.

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.280
We'll check in in a few more months and see if that's still the case.

01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:26.700
Because I still maintain, I think it's a great idea.

01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:30.880
And I think Tumbleweed and Leap are both exactly what they should be doing.

01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:33.520
But in a year from now, that's really going to be the telling thing.

01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:34.880
How many things got back ported?

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.160
How many things actually made it in there?

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:38.280
How many times have they changed direction?

01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:39.280
Yeah.

01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:41.360
And I'm not saying any of that's going to be negative.

01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:42.360
No, not at all.

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:43.360
It's just how do those things-

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:44.360
We just don't know yet.

01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:45.360
Right.

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:49.840
And because in particular these types of distributions, there's so many unanswered questions.

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:53.640
It's just going to be a little bit to see how that plays out.

01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:56.120
But the folks over there are super clever.

01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:59.780
And so if anybody could get it right, it is probably them.

01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:01.160
And so I'm kind of glad they're doing it.

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:02.520
I'm encouraged to watch it.

01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:03.520
All right.

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:08.320
So this brings us to the last clip we're going to play on the show today.

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:10.680
And it was the one that was the most fun for me.

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:14.120
And I'm betting probably surprising for you, Wes.

01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:18.600
That was when Wimpy came on here and he dropped the pie bomb.

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:21.480
And then we got into a discussion about the future of open PC.

01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:25.080
Wimpy, I kind of wanted to pick your brain because I know you've hinted before on some

01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:29.920
pre and post shows that, and I haven't gotten, I have quite not yet gotten the complete picture,

01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:33.940
but the Raspberry Pi is starting to play a more and more important role for the Ubuntu

01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:37.040
Mate distro, isn't it?

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:40.240
It's our most popular platform.

01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:41.240
Wow.

01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:45.640
You mean, you mean other than x86 or including x86?

01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:50.760
It's more popular than 64 bit, 32 bit, x86.

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:51.760
Holy shit.

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:52.760
Are you serious?

01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:53.760
That's crazy.

01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:54.760
Wow.

01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:55.760
My world has just been rocked.

01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:56.760
Are you kidding me?

01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:00.320
No, it's downloaded about 1,200 times a day.

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.320
The image for the Pi.

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:02.320
That's awesome.

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.320
Wow.

01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:04.320
That's serious.

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:08.680
That is, that is, so what are your thoughts on that?

01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:15.440
Well, it means that in the last two releases of Ubuntu Mate, I've done the work for the

01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:25.520
Pi version in the last month of the release, but for this release, it's got even, you know,

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:30.280
it's being treated equally all the way through the development stage now.

01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:32.800
I feel like I need to take a minute.

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:35.320
Like I wasn't ready for that level of a bomb to be dropped.

01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:38.920
I don't know why I didn't know that because I kind of feel like I should have known that,

01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:42.400
but it to me is shocking to me, actually.

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:46.400
I've actually been paying attention to a lot of communities around Raspberry Pi and Reddit

01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:51.160
or Google Plus and various different places, and the majority of times people ask what

01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:57.120
to put on the Pi, Raspbian is no longer even mentioned, Ubuntu Mate is always the first

01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:58.120
choice.

01:41:58.120 --> 01:41:59.120
I mean, it makes sense.

01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:00.120
It does make sense.

01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:02.320
I mean, it's way more pleasant to use and it looks pretty.

01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:03.960
With me, that's a big deal, though.

01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:07.000
I mean, congratulations because that's a big deal.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.520
And so when you look at these types of devices, are you starting to say, all right, these

01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:13.520
aren't just sort of toys.

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:19.000
These are going to become possibly the next open PC.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Now hold on.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.320
I want to make sure I'm framing this right, but when I look at tablets and phones, I get

01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:30.460
a little sad because they look locked down and glued together, and I remember a time

01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:35.520
when I was in high school and I scraped together parts for months and months and months and

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:37.280
built my first PC.

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:43.040
I went and picked out my own case, and it was a life moment for me.

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:44.520
And you learned a lot along the way.

01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:45.520
A ton of stuff.

01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:46.520
And I read.

01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:49.440
I mean, it was really my first geek project that I really researched and all that kind

01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:50.440
of stuff.

01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:54.920
And now I look at this Onion Omega here, and I'm sitting here like Legos building a PC,

01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:59.280
and I think, geez, I could give this to my kid and he could play Minecraft on this, maybe

01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:02.720
not this one, but the Raspberry Pi Zero.

01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:08.880
This is maybe getting to the point now where it is actually going to be something that

01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:12.560
has some serious long-term legs as a serious desktop contender.

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:20.240
And one more thing, Wimpy, before I toss it back to you is I, in the late 90s, had a conversation

01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:26.200
with a guy named Scott, a really great guy, and his day job was to run an IBM mainframe.

01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:33.920
And he looked down at desktop PCs as toys that couldn't do real work, that weren't powerful

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:34.920
enough.

01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:40.120
And he called the desktops, oh, you mean those Mattel inside PCs?

01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:42.600
Those Mattel inside, because they were toys.

01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:45.820
And I look at the Omega, and I go, oh, this is a cute Lego toy.

01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:48.840
But actually, maybe I'm looking at it from Scott's perspective.

01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:52.720
And when Wimpy sees he's getting over 1,000 downloads a day, I'm wondering, are you looking

01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:58.520
at these mini PCs, these Raspberry Pis, and these Omegas, and the BagelBone, and whatever,

01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:03.000
are you looking at this and going, this might actually be something that gets wider adoption

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.880
use than the traditional PC one day?

01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:06.880
I think so.

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:14.000
Certainly, if you look outside of the developed nations, I think this is going to be the ARM-based

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.460
devices are going to be the principal computing platform.

01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:21.160
And if you're not doing stuff on ARM, you'll be irrelevant.

01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:22.160
Wow.

01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:23.880
Bad time to own Intel stock.

01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:27.480
I am still sort of sitting here going, damn, that is a big deal.

01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:31.840
And Wimpy, I'm curious, it's been a few weeks, is there any follow-up thoughts to that segment?

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:34.760
Yeah, a couple.

01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:41.480
So just before Christmas, we're going to release a point release of Ubuntu Mate 15.10.

01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:46.120
So we're going to update some of the bits and pieces that are in the image and fix a

01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.480
couple of bugs.

01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:55.920
So not a major re-spin, but I have moved the build over to the Ubuntu Pi Flavor Maker project.

01:44:55.920 --> 01:45:03.640
So alongside the Ubuntu Mate release will also be a spin of Lubuntu 15.10, Xubuntu 15.10,

01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:06.120
and also Ubuntu Server.

01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:10.720
So people can come and have a real Ubuntu Christmas on their Raspberry Pi 2s.

01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:15.200
Yeah, I mean, that is sort of perfect for the holidays, people getting Raspberry Pis.

01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:17.920
Like we started at the beginning of the show, this Kano here, or however you say, canoe

01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:20.920
or whatever you say, that's a Raspberry Pi 2.

01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:23.800
And I'm putting that under the Christmas tree this year.

01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:26.920
And I'm going to put Ubuntu Mate on there.

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:29.180
That's a $4 course.

01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:32.600
When we spoke a couple of weeks ago about this, and you were surprised at the uptake

01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:35.780
of these on boards, I thought about it.

01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:41.220
And there was a guy who supplied a bit of feedback to the Linux Voice podcast where

01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:47.480
he talked about, he drew a parallel between where the engineers for steam engine construction

01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:51.440
were in the UK during the Industrial Revolution.

01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:54.840
And it wasn't where the money was, it was where the raw materials were.

01:45:54.840 --> 01:46:01.360
And he likened this to Linus and creating Linux in that as a 21 year old student, the

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:07.280
raw materials that were available to Linus was an Intel PC.

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:11.000
And that's why Linux was created on an Intel PC.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.760
And these days, the raw materials that are readily accessible and available to most people

01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:19.440
around the world are these ARM SBCs.

01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:25.480
And it's those boards that are going to drive the tinkering and the hobbying and the enthusiasts

01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:30.520
that we all were with our PCs, you know, 5, 10, 15, 20 years ago.

01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:34.520
And these are going to be the new devices that people learn about computers on.

01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:39.920
You know, that that really rings true with me in 1.21, when is when you sort of drop

01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:44.320
what I call the pie bomb on us.

01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:45.320
That's when it clicked with me.

01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:51.060
I think we even talked about it in the clip is I realized that if I was a high school

01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:56.200
student or even a little younger or in that range, this would be my experimental PC platform

01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:02.360
because the Dells and the Lenovo's and the ample of this world have sealed the hoods

01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:04.560
and put everything under a plastic wrap with glue.

01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:09.960
And even then, like I have admittedly fond memories of breaking my parents, you know,

01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:11.600
like desktop computer when I was a kid.

01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:12.600
Right.

01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:13.600
Yeah.

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:15.920
But these days, for like 30 bucks, you're like, oh, here, here's your whole machine.

01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:16.920
Just go wild.

01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:17.920
Yeah.

01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:18.920
And it makes it reasonable.

01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:19.920
Or $5.

01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:20.920
Or $5.

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:21.920
Yeah, exactly.

01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:22.920
Yeah.

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:26.440
So that is that has been an amazing trend to really, I mean, to see that come down this

01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:32.520
year, really something and then to see the actual usage tick up in the downloads for

01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:34.740
Ubuntu Mate edition.

01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:35.740
Really cool.

01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:36.880
And it just makes so much sense.

01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:38.080
It really does.

01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:40.800
So I just find that to be fascinating.

01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:43.960
And I can only imagine where 2016 is going to take it.

01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:44.960
It's awesome.

01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:46.240
It rocked in 2015.

01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:47.240
It rocked.

01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:49.800
And it's funny, you know, totally just not planned at all.

01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:54.240
Here we are with this canoe system that we unboxed today on the show.

01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:56.480
And it is it is so much.

01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:57.480
It's beautiful, well-designed.

01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:58.480
Yeah.

01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:02.560
And it brings all the current open source technology.

01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:04.360
It is really something to see this.

01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:06.920
And I just as a kid would have loved this.

01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:10.040
And they also have mobile apps to manage the system and they have them in the Play Store

01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:11.040
and the App Store.

01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:14.040
It says at Team Canoe or Kano, K-A-N-O.

01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:15.040
K-A-N-O.

01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:16.040
You can't understand this.

01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:17.040
I know.

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:18.040
K-A-N-O.

01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:19.040
I know.

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:20.040
It's hard to pronounce.

01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:22.040
I think I want to say canoe because it's like the idea is like it's a canoe.

01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:23.040
Or Kano.

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:24.520
But Kano doesn't make any sense.

01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:26.600
Anyways, I think they just sent this to me.

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:30.840
I don't think I backed this particular project.

01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:32.440
I think they just sent it to me to talk about it.

01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:34.480
And so I'm pretty impressed.

01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:36.800
Wes, something else I'm kind of impressed with.

01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:40.840
We decided since this is a holiday episode of The Unplugged Show that we would drink

01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:44.720
a little beer as we do from time to time.

01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:47.880
And this is something you brought and you wanted to get something specifically in the

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:49.200
holiday spirit, Wes.

01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:51.080
So I won't steal your thunder.

01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:52.480
What did you bring in?

01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:55.720
We are currently drinking Stone Coffee Milk Stout.

01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:58.560
Yeah, it's an ale brewed with roasted coffee bean.

01:48:58.560 --> 01:48:59.560
Does that mean it's caffeinated?

01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:00.880
I believe so.

01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:01.880
One would hope anyway.

01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:03.280
That is actually pretty great.

01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:06.720
And so when you drink it, it definitely has like a coffee note.

01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:08.120
There's no getting around that.

01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:11.640
It's 5% alcohol by volume.

01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:13.320
Which is a little lower than I usually bring.

01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:15.360
I'm just going to say that right now.

01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:16.360
That is true.

01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:17.360
Oh yeah, for the show.

01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:18.360
Yeah, for sure.

01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:24.480
So it's Stone Coffee Milk Stout, a bittersweet, creamy, coffee-laced stout from imperial stouts

01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:25.520
to IPAs.

01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:31.560
We've discovered through the delicious trial and error that the tantalizing, roasty lift

01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:35.920
that comes from adding coffee beans to just about any beer style.

01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:36.920
And they go on.

01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:37.920
It does pair nicely.

01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:39.240
I've got to say, it's darn smooth.

01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:41.920
You know, when you brought in, I was like, coffee and a beer.

01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:43.880
I've done beers tasty before.

01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:45.960
This doesn't usually go well for me.

01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:47.960
And you know what?

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:48.960
It went really well.

01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:49.960
It's pretty good.

01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.600
Yeah, this is a great beer to drink during the show.

01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:53.280
So thank you, Wes, for bringing this in.

01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:56.760
And I think we're going to give it the Linux-unplugged thumbs up.

01:49:56.760 --> 01:49:57.760
Thumbs up.

01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:58.760
Two thumbs up.

01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.440
Stone Coffee Milk Stout.

01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:03.600
Somebody in the Mumble Room, I think, was saying they have just about every stone brew

01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:04.600
ever.

01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:09.960
I don't know who that was, but anybody in there, a stone beer fan or a fish in the auto

01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:12.240
that could chime in and give us more information?

01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:14.800
Because we just basically picked up the bottles here.

01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:15.800
We sure did.

01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:16.800
Yeah.

01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:19.200
But I mean, I've enjoyed their IPA in particular in the past.

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:20.200
Yeah.

01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:21.200
Yeah.

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:22.200
Oh yeah.

01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:23.200
So I'm a con.

01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:24.200
I'm a con.

01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:25.200
So there you go.

01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:26.200
Oh, thanks, Wes.

01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:27.200
It was very good.

01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:30.520
And if you guys have any suggestions, feel free to submit those and we will drink them

01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:31.920
and talk about them on the air.

01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:32.920
We should.

01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:33.920
You know what?

01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:34.920
That'd be fun to do that.

01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:37.400
Because one of the things that the original...

01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:40.100
So there was two original ideas for Linux-unplugged.

01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:44.360
One of them was so terrible, I almost feel like I shouldn't even say it because it's

01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:45.360
embarrassing.

01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:47.820
Say it.

01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:50.900
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:51.900
And you know who you are.

01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:53.400
There's somebody who doesn't want to mess with the...

01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:54.400
I just want to surf the...

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:58.720
I just want to buy something on Amazon, send an email to my kids, look at some websites.

01:50:58.720 --> 01:50:59.720
All right.

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:02.320
So I had to play a little Leo while I could think about it.

01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:04.240
I hit dead air.

01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:08.720
So the first idea for Linux-unplugged was I get so much email that comes in the Linux

01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:09.720
action show.

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:13.920
I'm just going to start a podcast where I just read my damn email because I'm never

01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:14.920
getting to it.

01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:15.920
And the only thing...

01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:20.520
The only work I get done is the work I have to get done to make sure shows go on the air

01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:21.920
because that's all I have.

01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:22.920
That's all I have in me.

01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:24.800
And it's the only thing I get done is like...

01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:26.200
And it's like big things.

01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:27.280
I'm not even like...

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:32.320
There's things in my life that are extremely important like health insurance or insurance.

01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:34.160
All these things, I don't get those done.

01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:37.320
What I get done is whatever I have to get done to make sure these shows go on the air.

01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:40.840
And so I was like, this email is never getting done.

01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:42.760
I'm never reading all these emails.

01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:44.040
What I'm going to do is...

01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:46.680
And actually, this is the real concept here.

01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:50.060
I'm going to take Thunderbird, I'm going to open it up, and I'm going to tag emails throughout

01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:51.060
the week.

01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:54.120
And then I'm going to go to that tag in Thunderbird, and I'm just going to read them on the air,

01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:55.440
and I'm going to answer them.

01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:56.600
And that's the freaking podcast.

01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:58.840
You know, Richard Dawkins has a whole YouTube thing.

01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:00.360
He just reads his hate mail.

01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:01.360
I think it could work the same way.

01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:02.360
Yeah.

01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:03.360
So that was the idea.

01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:05.520
But really, that was a horrible idea.

01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:07.920
It was so, so boring.

01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:10.200
But then the second idea, I think, is kind of solid.

01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:13.360
And it's actually what's inspired the show in reality.

01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:19.680
Because the emails have, over time, become less and less a part of the show.

01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:20.680
Fancy that.

01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:21.680
Yeah.

01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:29.520
The concept that I've actually ran with was, what does the world look like to real, actual

01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:31.160
Linux users?

01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:37.160
Because there is a lot of blogs and press out there who claim to be Linux users, or

01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:42.000
Linux advocates, or Linux journalists, and they don't actually use Linux.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.520
And so they miss the mark.

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:49.960
And they don't actually represent the day-to-day actual Linux user.

01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:55.480
And so often, that means they spin things, or they misunderstand things, or they superficially

01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:57.360
read things.

01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:03.200
And their reviews are touching on true and tried talking points that we've been discussing

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:04.200
since the 90s.

01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:05.760
And they're just exhausted.

01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:07.680
And we get so sick and tired of it.

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:13.160
And really, if we're Linux users, and something like Chrome comes along, and all of a sudden

01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:17.680
is downloading a binary package in the background that turns on our microphone, how, as Linux

01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:19.200
users, does that make us feel?

01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:23.960
If Volkswagen is, all of a sudden, revealed for altering test results because of their

01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:28.000
proprietary software as Linux users, what is our thought about that?

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:31.760
And you can go back through every single topic we played in the show, and you can see how

01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:38.280
we come at it from the perspective of people who use Linux on a daily basis, and thus affects

01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:40.400
our worldview.

01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:43.480
And you combine the fact that we have this virtual lug that comes in and discusses their

01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:47.680
opinions on things, and they represent that point of view as well, I think it makes for

01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:55.280
a very unique kind of talk show that is not like anything else, because we have gotten

01:53:55.280 --> 01:54:00.720
extremely lucky with really solid contributions from our community.

01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:02.400
I mean, absurdly lucky.

01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:05.760
We shouldn't be able to have an open Mumba room and have this many great contributors

01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:06.760
come in and speak intelligently.

01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:08.720
Oh, it really makes the show.

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:09.720
Right.

01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:14.320
So, somehow, we just fell backwards into that, and that is just a resource that has been

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:19.160
extremely useful, plus you have our perspective as people who are open source advocates first

01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:20.720
and Linux desktop users.

01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:26.120
I think it has made for an interesting perspective for a talk show that can handle a whole range

01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:28.720
of topics, from political to technical.

01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:33.640
And that is the second idea that has really, I kind of ran with for this show.

01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:37.200
Now here we are after all of this, and there has been some really interesting things.

01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:40.320
One of the things I really enjoyed, one of the things we did this year that I thought

01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:46.520
was kind of fun, is when we went to LinuxCon, we did Unplugged live from LinuxCon.

01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:51.920
And it was a little rough, because we literally just found a spot, and when we got there,

01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:55.240
I don't know if Noah wants me to tell the story, so nobody share this with Noah.

01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:56.240
Don't tell Noah.

01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:57.240
He won't listen to this episode.

01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:58.240
He's got a family.

01:54:58.240 --> 01:54:59.240
He doesn't listen to any of these.

01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:00.240
No, he does.

01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:01.240
He listens to Unplugged.

01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:02.240
But come on, this is the Christmas episode.

01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:03.240
Right.

01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:04.240
He won't have time to listen to this.

01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:05.240
Nope.

01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:06.240
And he doesn't know I've been drinking beer.

01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:10.920
So we get, we're at the Seattle Convention Center.

01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:16.440
This is like a legit professional convention center, and there is an area they have where

01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:21.280
they have these benches that have plugs and networking, and it's like the, you know, sit

01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:23.160
down at a workstation.

01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:26.080
And there's like four of them, and they're in front of windows.

01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:27.980
They're nice, but they're all taken.

01:55:27.980 --> 01:55:33.560
And so we get there, and I go, Noah, this was our last kind of plan, and all these spots

01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:34.560
are taken.

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:35.560
What do we do?

01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:37.640
He's like, what do you mean, what do we do?

01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:38.640
What do we do?

01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:40.200
He's like, you start setting up.

01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:41.880
I go, what do you mean you start setting up?

01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:43.600
He says, you start setting up.

01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:46.640
You start setting up, and they'll get out of the way.

01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:51.080
Because we look so official with all this equipment, that once we start setting it down,

01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:52.080
they get out of the way.

01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:53.880
And I'm like, that, that doesn't work.

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.920
And he's like, let's try it.

01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:59.840
So we go over there, and we bring over these, we have these Pelican cases, and we, we open

01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:03.280
them up, and we start setting up microphones and cameras and mixers, right?

01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:06.760
And we start computers, and sure enough, everybody at the table just gets up and walks away.

01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:07.760
And they move to another table.

01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:10.960
They just totally got out of our way, and we were able to bull-regard this spot for

01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:11.960
two hours.

01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:16.580
We boondocked in this spot for two hours and managed to record the Linux Unplugged show.

01:56:16.580 --> 01:56:23.040
And so we were able to do a live Linux Unplugged on location, and then we took prerecorded

01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:26.680
material where we did interviews and recorded a bunch of stuff, and brought that into the

01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:29.960
Linux Action Show pre-produced, so it was really kind of more refined.

01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:34.440
And I really liked that sort of ebb and flow between Unplugged and LAS this year, where

01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:38.360
we went on location, did the live, raw, nitty-gritty stuff in Unplugged.

01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:41.640
We were even able to bring the Mamba Room to the Linux convention with us, which was

01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:42.960
totally badass.

01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:46.440
And then in LAS, we had the more refined, cut-down versions.

01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:50.040
And I think that was kind of a cool thing that we, so I want to play with more of that

01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:51.040
next year.

01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:52.040
Yeah.

01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:53.040
It was kind of cool.

01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:54.040
The synchronicity between LAS and Unplugged.

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:55.040
That was nice.

01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:58.480
And then last but not least, I think one of my favorite things about Linux Unplugged this

01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:00.400
year, of course, was Wes joining the cast.

01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:01.400
Well, thank you, sir.

01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:05.360
Yeah, it wasn't, you know, Wes, you've been a great addition, and you've had great contributions

01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:06.360
to the show.

01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:08.560
I'm very pleased to be here.

01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:09.560
And you usually bring beer.

01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:10.560
Hey.

01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:11.560
That doesn't hurt.

01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:12.560
So that's pretty solid, too.

01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:16.640
And then, of course, last but not least, our Mumble Room.

01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:18.120
Now we're going to have one more episode this year.

01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:19.120
This isn't the last episode of the year.

01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:20.780
Yes, please be here.

01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:26.400
But if you want to get your crystal ball and be real prognosticating and sound super smart,

01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:31.200
or put yourself out on the line, join us for 1.25 in the Mumble Room.

01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:33.560
Thank you, Mumble Room, though, for great contributions this year.

01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:36.720
You guys, you know, playing back those clips, it's obvious you guys helped make the show.

01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:37.720
Absolutely.

01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:38.720
So it means a lot to us.

01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:42.200
You can join us live over at jblive.tv, go to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to

01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:45.320
get it converted to your local time zone, linuxactionshow.reddit.com to submit content.

01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:49.660
All right, everybody, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:57:49.660 --> 01:58:18.400
Have a great holiday, and we'll see you right back here next week.
