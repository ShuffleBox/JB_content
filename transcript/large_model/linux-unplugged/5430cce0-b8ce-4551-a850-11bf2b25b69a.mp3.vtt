WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.520
My son is currently going back and forth between believing in Santa Claus versus not like he has a pretty good theory his theory

00:07.520 --> 00:12.040
It's pretty solid. He thinks that Santa Claus is real. It's just that Santa Claus is Amazon

00:12.280 --> 00:14.740
So if you ask him Dylan, who is Santa Claus Amazon?

00:22.240 --> 00:27.600
I know and he recognizes the Amazon wrapping paper and that's usually what dads know all the presents from dad come in

00:27.600 --> 00:32.720
Yeah, when he's a father Amazon will have reindeer shaped drone, right? Yeah

00:34.400 --> 00:35.880
They will

00:35.880 --> 00:38.480
with custom 3d printed boxes and

00:39.000 --> 00:41.920
Man, Amazon needs 3d printed boxes. That would be great

00:43.040 --> 00:47.440
If the reindeer drones don't happen, I'm protesting. Yeah, that's that'll be a missed opportunity

00:47.720 --> 00:51.040
Wimpy you should market that patent that and then sell it

00:51.040 --> 00:56.960
Faisal yeah, I just sell for you for a good deal like $500,000 or something like that. I

00:57.560 --> 01:02.720
Just want my unlimited credits on my fire TV. That is that is brilliant

01:02.720 --> 01:08.000
That is that is eating up my spare change. Did I did I tell you I can't did I said?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.660
I might have mentioned it on there that I cancelled my Nexus player order

01:11.440 --> 01:16.180
And I don't blame you. I'm gonna get a fire. I read the reviews on the Nexus player and it just sounds

01:16.180 --> 01:20.940
It sounds like a total miss. I think on

01:21.580 --> 01:27.840
Okay. Yeah, I thought I remembered saying something. Yeah, so now the fire TV is really terrific and some advice

01:27.840 --> 01:30.320
You gave me a couple of a few weeks back now

01:30.320 --> 01:37.020
I was asking about controllers for Steam on Linux and you recommended the wired Xbox 360 controller

01:37.780 --> 01:42.700
Compatible with the fire TV you can plug the USB in of it. You just plug it in you just plug the

01:42.700 --> 01:48.660
Xbox 360 360 USB controller in and all the buttons are mapped

01:48.660 --> 01:54.940
It works exactly like the official Amazon controller, but it's half the price and it's stonking good

01:54.940 --> 01:58.340
So I'm using that on the fire TV for gaming that is winning

01:58.340 --> 01:58.820
Yeah

01:58.820 --> 02:04.740
Arbilis is right like you have the Google TV now the Nexus Q and the Nexus player and all of these three products have been

02:04.740 --> 02:10.460
In my opinion, I'm sure people like the Google TV is used by people still in it and loved but in my opinion

02:10.460 --> 02:15.620
it fails on a couple of critical points that would really bug me and you know

02:15.620 --> 02:18.820
The number one thing that jumped out me in especially a couple of the reviews

02:19.060 --> 02:23.300
Complained about the same type of lagging us in the same kinds of areas and it's exactly the kind of stuff that drives me

02:23.300 --> 02:24.820
crazy

02:24.820 --> 02:31.060
I'm the guy that will yeah, you know back before the set-top boxes like the Roku could could handle decent performance

02:31.060 --> 02:34.340
I was the guy that would just build an XBMC machine

02:34.340 --> 02:37.780
But in because I needed a PC powerful enough to just not have a laggy system

02:37.780 --> 02:40.600
Because who wants to sit down with the TV and like then wait for their computer

02:41.540 --> 02:46.420
Yeah, quite. Well, the the fire TV is really really slick. It's very responsive

02:47.300 --> 02:50.380
In all respects. I mean it does some really neat things as well

02:50.820 --> 02:57.180
So the first thing is when it arrives it's pre-configured with your account credentials. That's nice

02:57.180 --> 03:00.780
So like a nice touch that yeah nice touch. Yeah

03:01.220 --> 03:07.500
But it's a bit like oh, I didn't expect that but then when you start watching TV episodes and things like that

03:07.500 --> 03:13.300
It will pre download the next in the series. It stores them. It stores them. Yeah

03:13.700 --> 03:18.660
Yeah, so when you then say I want to watch the next episode of Battlestar Galacta

03:18.660 --> 03:25.260
It's just instant because it's already there and it means that you know, the fast-forward and rewind stuff is really responsive

03:25.260 --> 03:27.520
I like that kind of hybrid streaming download approach

03:28.180 --> 03:34.100
So I assume you could probably stream immediately right you could go in there and if you had not ever watched say like I don't

03:34.100 --> 03:37.980
Know 24 and you went to go watch season 1 episode 1 and 24 it would play immediately, right?

03:37.980 --> 03:43.380
But then you would just start down. Yeah, that is so but but it will pull it down faster than you're watching it

03:43.380 --> 03:48.740
So eventually you're you're playing it off the local device rather than off the stream

03:48.740 --> 03:54.460
And then it will be grabbing the next one if it thinks that this is something that you're you know into and watching

03:57.500 --> 03:59.300
That I got it I got that's it, you know

03:59.300 --> 04:02.900
I'm what I'm doing is I got a couple of TVs that I like a lot

04:02.900 --> 04:08.140
I don't I feel like a TV buying a TV is like a huge decision too, which is a little silly

04:08.140 --> 04:11.620
But I have a couple of TVs that I like a lot that I have bookmarked to see if they go on Black Friday sale

04:11.620 --> 04:13.620
And if they do I'm gonna get an Amazon fire TV with it

04:16.140 --> 04:18.140
Yeah, I'm really impressed

04:18.860 --> 04:25.660
We've ditched the Roku in the front room now and I'm now looking at the fire TV stick to replace the other Roku in the bedroom

04:25.780 --> 04:28.780
Did you guys see they announced their tier pricing for bit torrent sink?

04:28.780 --> 04:34.780
No, yeah. Yeah, it's a thing. They're doing a tiered pricing thing. Let me go look it up real quick. I think I saw us. What what?

04:36.780 --> 04:42.780
I'll stop using bit torrent sink and start and use sink thing because that's

04:42.780 --> 04:46.780
That's horrible. I'm looking it up now. Maybe it was a prank before I

04:46.780 --> 04:48.780
They're still gonna release like a

04:49.780 --> 04:54.780
Solid free version everything that you have now you're gonna get to keep you won't lose anything

04:54.780 --> 04:57.780
All right, so that was the thing I saw that wasn't me just being crazy

04:57.780 --> 04:59.780
What the hell?

04:59.780 --> 05:01.780
Are you guys seeing this?

05:01.780 --> 05:04.780
Yeah, what do you think of this? What do you think about this sucks?

05:06.780 --> 05:13.780
At the moment, I've got probably 200 gigabytes. Well, I think I think yeah, I published all the unfiltered supporters

05:14.780 --> 05:19.780
Files and every single episode is usually one to two gigabytes minimum

05:19.780 --> 05:23.780
And you know, there's a lot of episodes and then yeah, I know it really so that shit, isn't it?

05:23.780 --> 05:30.780
Okay, so I'm gonna have to bite the bullet on the sink thing and get over the rather clunky trust relationship model

05:30.780 --> 05:32.780
I promise

05:32.780 --> 05:37.780
That pulse that pulse model doesn't work for me. I can't add each listener individual

05:37.780 --> 05:41.780
No, no, it doesn't work for you and then it's a pain in the what sits for me because I've got

05:42.780 --> 05:49.780
Bit sync on all of the laptops and desktops and the NAS and a couple of servers out, you know providers

05:49.780 --> 05:56.780
So I've probably got at least a dozen to 14 things and just that is going to be a mess because that's a 28-way

05:57.780 --> 06:00.780
Key exchange which is doesn't scale really does it?

06:01.780 --> 06:07.780
Way to add add keys from like the command line because in theory what you could do is

06:08.780 --> 06:14.780
When someone subscribes to like the unfiltered stuff you could send them an email it like it could and that could be automated

06:14.780 --> 06:20.780
They could add their key and then you could have just a back end that automatically adds it to

06:21.780 --> 06:26.780
The sink thing. So yeah, so okay. So sink is gonna be

06:27.780 --> 06:30.780
Pro is gonna be forty nine dollar. I'm sorry forty dollars a year

06:31.780 --> 06:33.780
Gives you unlimited files

06:34.780 --> 06:36.780
Yeah, she's boy. This is rough, right?

06:36.780 --> 06:40.780
Some people call it bait and swing folders as well though. This is rubbish. Oh

06:40.780 --> 06:46.780
I've got because in lieu of in lieu of selective sync. I've got lots of sync folders, right?

06:46.780 --> 06:48.780
That's how you thought my torrent sink. Yeah. Yeah

06:49.780 --> 06:51.780
It isn't

06:51.780 --> 06:56.780
Looking more like 96 euros a year from from what I'm looking at here

06:57.780 --> 06:59.780
Isn't isn't bit torrent sink

06:59.780 --> 07:01.780
distributed

07:01.780 --> 07:05.780
Well, it's decentralized. It's the the way the files are shared is decentralized

07:05.780 --> 07:12.780
It's basically it's basically they're they're nobbling their software to get money out of us

07:12.780 --> 07:14.780
Well, this is this is why they're never open sourced

07:14.780 --> 07:19.780
It isn't that technically be illegal because you think other people's resources to get money. No, I mean this is not

07:20.780 --> 07:25.780
You launch a beta it's free during the beta and then when you are done with the beta you charge

07:25.780 --> 07:27.780
I mean, that's not too uncommon

07:28.780 --> 07:31.780
Chris what if you use an old version for

07:31.780 --> 07:37.780
for our filter on content? Yeah, I suppose you could stick but the thing is is if the clients update

07:37.780 --> 07:41.780
I've noticed on bit torrent sink that can be an issue if the server falls too far behind some of the clients

07:41.780 --> 07:43.780
At least it happened to me once

07:43.780 --> 07:46.780
It became a problem and I and some people couldn't get files anymore

07:47.780 --> 07:54.780
So another one looking good now, maybe yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, another one to look a C file if you've not used that

07:54.780 --> 08:00.780
Sparkle share. Yeah, and of course if you want to pay a spider oak

08:04.780 --> 08:11.780
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's really packing it in for the holidays. My name is Chris

08:11.780 --> 08:13.780
And my name is Matt. Hey there Matt

08:13.780 --> 08:17.780
So rumor has it you were just chowing down on a little bacon before we got started today

08:17.780 --> 08:19.780
I was I was

08:19.780 --> 08:24.780
You know, I got up here about 15 till logged in about 10 till and I'm like cramming bacon down my face

08:24.780 --> 08:27.780
But the cool through it you were still doing your thing. So I was like, oh cool. I got time to eat

08:27.780 --> 08:31.780
I had some meatballs while you're having your bacon. It's like it's Sunday. It's like we're our Sunday routine on Tuesday

08:31.780 --> 08:36.780
Oh, so I have a I have a lot to cover today. I'm really excited about today's show

08:37.780 --> 08:43.780
So we are following up with Charlie from Sunday's Linux action show and he's brought some of the students and they're all huddled around a laptop

08:43.780 --> 08:48.780
Right now and we're gonna talk to them about their experiences with Linux really looking forward to that

08:49.780 --> 08:51.780
We've got some great emails to read this week

08:51.780 --> 08:57.780
There's some thought-provoking questions and potentially some big changes coming to the Jupiter broadcasting website and

08:58.780 --> 09:01.780
No towards the end of the show. I'm gonna play a preview clip of

09:02.780 --> 09:07.780
Interview that will be playing on Sunday's Linux action show with Mark Shuttleworth and the topic is Jermaine

09:07.780 --> 09:13.780
To this show. It's something we've been talking about a lot lately the tone of dialogue in the open source community around all the recent

09:13.780 --> 09:19.780
Systemd debates and Debbie and all that kind of stuff. I wanted to ask Mark Shuttleworth what he thought about it and

09:19.780 --> 09:21.780
Got his a brief summary of his thoughts

09:21.780 --> 09:23.780
We go into greater detail in the Sunday interview

09:23.780 --> 09:26.780
We're gonna play a clip of that because it felt like it fit pretty well

09:26.780 --> 09:29.780
With the topic that we have been recently discussing here on the show

09:29.780 --> 09:32.780
So that'll be towards the end of the show a lot of the stuff that we've been talking about

09:32.780 --> 09:37.780
With the topic that we have been recently discussing here on the show. So that'll be towards the end of the show a lot to do today

09:37.780 --> 09:42.780
So Matt, you know what we got to do. You guys start with that email got to start with that

09:42.780 --> 09:47.780
He's good. So Jesse writes in and he has a question for our guest today

09:47.780 --> 09:51.780
so I will start with our first email that pertains to Charlie and

09:52.780 --> 09:57.780
Charlie I I'll read this to you and then I'll give you a chance to respond and it goes a little something like this

09:57.780 --> 10:03.780
Jesse says hello there Chris Madden obviously now Charlie I saw your latest episode of the Linux action show episode

10:03.780 --> 10:05.780
340 with Charlie raising your rising your

10:06.780 --> 10:13.780
And I was just wondering how would you introduce Linux and open source to a school district that still uses Windows XP and power PC

10:13.780 --> 10:17.780
Versions of OS 10 and they can't really afford new hardware or software

10:17.780 --> 10:20.780
Due to politicians stealing money from the state budget

10:20.780 --> 10:23.780
Thanks for your hard time and all your hard work and any ideas

10:23.780 --> 10:28.780
So Charlie if somebody's in a really budget restricted environment, maybe they couldn't buy laptops for students

10:28.780 --> 10:30.780
And can't really afford to buy new hardware

10:30.780 --> 10:34.780
Is there somewhere where you would give them advice to start on rolling out Linux and open source in a district?

10:36.780 --> 10:41.780
Oh, sorry Charlie I had you turned down go ahead Charlie. Oh, yeah, no problem. Thanks again for having us on the show today

10:41.780 --> 10:46.780
This is just so much fun. Yeah, you know, that's that that's tough, you know being in a school, you know

10:46.780 --> 10:52.780
You've worked in a school. We've we've you know both been there when you know budgets and resources are restricted

10:52.780 --> 10:54.780
What I could offer up is

10:55.780 --> 10:57.780
Probably just starting small

10:57.780 --> 11:04.780
Right in the past, you know really are some of our first implementations on the desktop or with Zubuntu

11:04.780 --> 11:09.780
Just simply because the interface was lightweight and we could take advantage of lower-end hardware

11:10.780 --> 11:16.780
But also I think you know more germane to this is a discussion of just starting, you know in a very small fashion

11:16.780 --> 11:21.780
You know when we've we've scaled up to thousands of machines in the desktop, but if we didn't start there

11:22.780 --> 11:27.780
We built on very small successes, you know in many cases we installed

11:27.780 --> 11:31.780
You know some flavor of Linux on just a few machines, you know

11:31.780 --> 11:37.780
Maybe just a teacher's set in a classroom or perhaps even just a single lab

11:37.780 --> 11:39.780
Very good. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense

11:39.780 --> 11:43.780
It requires patience, but you start small and you build up after successes

11:43.780 --> 11:47.780
You get some successes under your belt prove that it's worth everybody's time prove

11:47.780 --> 11:51.780
It's worth whatever little budget is available and then build on top of that. That's great advice

11:51.780 --> 11:52.780
Yeah, absolutely

11:52.780 --> 11:58.780
And it helps also just you know to bring teachers on board and and staff and and of course students too

11:58.780 --> 12:02.780
You know, we often forget that we want to get students excited about technology

12:02.780 --> 12:05.780
And I think that's an important part of the equation as well. Yeah, great point

12:05.780 --> 12:11.780
All right. So there you go. Jesse. There's some great starting points from Charlie and I wish you the best of luck sir

12:11.780 --> 12:15.780
And you know when I tried to get Linux deployed in my work environment

12:15.780 --> 12:20.780
It was fundamentally critical to have these mini successes. It started small and then I built on top of that

12:20.780 --> 12:23.780
And it doesn't have to be a school district. It can be any kind of environment like that

12:23.780 --> 12:28.780
So Bugsbane the third writes in and maybe this is one we can open up to the whole mumble room

12:28.780 --> 12:31.780
He says I've been using Linux for over a decade and I love it

12:31.780 --> 12:35.780
While I can't write a line of code to save my life over the years

12:35.780 --> 12:39.780
I've gotten very used to setting up networks compiling code triaging bugs, etc

12:39.780 --> 12:42.780
I have no formal qualifications, but I've learned a lot

12:42.780 --> 12:48.780
Now I'd like to use all of that training to get a job, but I have no idea where to start

12:48.780 --> 12:53.780
Entry job levels entry jobs seem to be overqualified

12:53.780 --> 12:56.780
We have requirements where you've been a network administrator for many years or you're a developer

12:56.780 --> 12:58.780
And currently not having a job

12:58.780 --> 13:02.780
I don't have a lot of money to spend on getting certifications or training to become a coder

13:02.780 --> 13:07.780
So where would you or anyone in the audience recommend someone start?

13:07.780 --> 13:11.780
And so the question is if you have a good sense of Linux

13:11.780 --> 13:14.780
Maybe you've been using it for a while, but you don't have anything on that resume

13:14.780 --> 13:17.780
How could you get in and get started?

13:17.780 --> 13:21.780
And I have I'll start with my idea and then anybody that wants to jump in please do so

13:21.780 --> 13:25.780
I would if you're all if you're all if you are unemployed

13:25.780 --> 13:30.780
Consider the fact that you might have something in excess that a lot of people don't have

13:30.780 --> 13:32.780
And it's not necessarily money. It's time

13:32.780 --> 13:38.780
And you might consider starting at the ground floor somewhere and just on a volunteer basis to see if they need help

13:38.780 --> 13:42.780
And then perhaps make yourself invaluable and they might consider hiring you

13:42.780 --> 13:44.780
That would be one way I know that's easier said than done

13:44.780 --> 13:45.780
Matt, what do you think?

13:45.780 --> 13:49.780
What about like just trying to get your foot in the door and maybe trying to get somebody's attention?

13:49.780 --> 13:51.780
Is it got to be like, do you need to know somebody?

13:51.780 --> 13:53.780
Is that is he screwed if he doesn't know somebody?

13:53.780 --> 13:56.780
No, you hit the nail on the head with volunteering

13:56.780 --> 13:58.780
Both pretty much everything I've ever done in my life

13:58.780 --> 14:01.780
I started at some capacity of working for free

14:01.780 --> 14:05.780
And I think that volunteering for a worthwhile organization makes a lot of sense

14:05.780 --> 14:10.780
Because not only do you have something very strong to put on your resume later

14:10.780 --> 14:13.780
But you also showed that you weren't watching Oprah all day on television

14:13.780 --> 14:15.780
You're actually doing something productive, right?

14:15.780 --> 14:16.780
Getting work experience

14:16.780 --> 14:18.780
Exactly. It's truly it

14:18.780 --> 14:21.780
I mean, that's you know, I've been self-employed for years

14:21.780 --> 14:25.780
And so for me, it's like I can't fathom not having you know

14:25.780 --> 14:27.780
If I'm not in the middle of a project, I'll go make one

14:27.780 --> 14:28.780
And I think the same thing applies here

14:28.780 --> 14:31.780
If you could find a need, go fill it, figure it out

14:31.780 --> 14:33.780
You know, just get out there and try stuff

14:33.780 --> 14:34.780
I love it. That's great advice

14:34.780 --> 14:36.780
Anybody in the mumbler want to jump in with anything before we move on?

14:36.780 --> 14:38.780
I think that's probably good stuff right there

14:38.780 --> 14:41.780
But if anybody else has any pointers of something that got them a gig

14:41.780 --> 14:43.780
We'd love to hear it

14:43.780 --> 14:48.780
I'd just like to echo Chris that absolutely volunteering is the way to go

14:48.780 --> 14:51.780
You know, open source by its very nature is participatory

14:51.780 --> 14:55.780
And really the best way to demonstrate your skills is to get out and volunteer

14:55.780 --> 14:58.780
Be active in projects and programs and demonstrate what you got

14:58.780 --> 15:00.780
Nailed it. All right

15:00.780 --> 15:07.780
I'd also say that there's sometimes where I've talked to people who said that they didn't have enough experience

15:07.780 --> 15:13.780
Because the job listings required something so absurd that it's not even possible

15:13.780 --> 15:21.780
But a lot of the times these employers are looking for people who are willing to try anyway

15:21.780 --> 15:23.780
Yeah, I've heard that before too

15:23.780 --> 15:25.780
Yeah, so they'll set up an experience

15:25.780 --> 15:28.780
It's like you have to have three years of experience for this

15:28.780 --> 15:30.780
And two years experience for this

15:30.780 --> 15:32.780
But they don't actually want that

15:32.780 --> 15:33.780
They're kind of like

15:33.780 --> 15:40.780
Sometimes they'll have it where it's kind of a deterrent for someone who's not motivated enough to try

15:40.780 --> 15:43.780
They don't want them working for them anyway

15:43.780 --> 15:46.780
So if you don't have the experience but you go there and say

15:46.780 --> 15:48.780
And you can prove that you can do it anyway

15:48.780 --> 15:49.780
They'll hire you

15:49.780 --> 15:50.780
That's a great point

15:50.780 --> 15:53.780
From their perspective they're like we're either going to get somebody who's really determined

15:53.780 --> 15:56.780
And willing to go the extra mile for us

15:56.780 --> 15:59.780
Or B, we'll get really lucky and get somebody who's super qualified

15:59.780 --> 16:01.780
And we won't have to pay them very much

16:01.780 --> 16:02.780
And on top of that

16:02.780 --> 16:05.780
Once you're in the negotiations for the job

16:05.780 --> 16:07.780
If they're going to give it to you and you didn't meet all the qualifications

16:07.780 --> 16:08.780
They can be like well

16:08.780 --> 16:12.780
You know we were looking for somebody who had 15 years as a DBA

16:12.780 --> 16:14.780
And 25 years as a VB programmer

16:14.780 --> 16:18.780
So we're going to go ahead and cut off about 10K from what we listed in the job application

16:18.780 --> 16:20.780
But you got the job, congratulations

16:20.780 --> 16:21.780
You know that's another reason they do it

16:21.780 --> 16:23.780
They make up these impossible qualifications

16:23.780 --> 16:26.780
And when you don't meet them they can kind of reduce their commitment

16:26.780 --> 16:29.780
We want you to have like 10 years of VB experience

16:29.780 --> 16:30.780
And also speak Chinese

16:30.780 --> 16:31.780
Yeah, yeah

16:31.780 --> 16:32.780
Have you been working with

16:32.780 --> 16:35.780
We need somebody who's been working with Linux for 35 years

16:35.780 --> 16:36.780
Can you do that for us?

16:36.780 --> 16:37.780
Yeah, no I can't

16:39.780 --> 16:40.780
Lies

16:40.780 --> 16:41.780
Yes, lies exactly

16:41.780 --> 16:43.780
Alright I'll tell you about something that's not a lie

16:43.780 --> 16:45.780
That's saving a little bit of money from Ting

16:45.780 --> 16:47.780
That's my mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider

16:47.780 --> 16:48.780
And that's our first sponsor this week

16:48.780 --> 16:50.780
Go to linux.ting.com

16:50.780 --> 16:51.780
Linux

16:51.780 --> 16:52.780
Yeah you get to put Linux in there

16:52.780 --> 16:53.780
Linux.ting.com

16:53.780 --> 16:54.780
Head over there

16:54.780 --> 16:55.780
Check out the Ting website

16:55.780 --> 16:56.780
By going to that URL

16:56.780 --> 16:58.780
You automatically are going to save 25 bucks

16:58.780 --> 16:59.780
If you pull the trigger and get a Ting device

16:59.780 --> 17:01.780
Or if you got a compatible Ting device

17:01.780 --> 17:02.780
You're going to save 25

17:02.780 --> 17:04.780
Or you're going to get 25 dollars in Ting credit

17:04.780 --> 17:06.780
Which could be like almost 2 months of service

17:06.780 --> 17:07.780
It's kind of crazy

17:07.780 --> 17:08.780
So why Ting?

17:08.780 --> 17:09.780
Right

17:09.780 --> 17:10.780
Why Switch?

17:10.780 --> 17:11.780
Why go through the hassle of moving over?

17:11.780 --> 17:13.780
Well first of all they make that switch pretty painless

17:13.780 --> 17:15.780
They've got an early termination relief program

17:15.780 --> 17:17.780
So if you're in a contract now

17:17.780 --> 17:19.780
They'll pay up to 75 dollars per line and you have to get cancelled

17:19.780 --> 17:20.780
If you're not in a contract

17:20.780 --> 17:23.780
Well then this is a better time than ever to move over

17:23.780 --> 17:25.780
Because you only pay for what you use

17:25.780 --> 17:28.780
It's just your minutes, your messages and your megabytes

17:28.780 --> 17:29.780
That's all you pay

17:29.780 --> 17:30.780
You just take that

17:30.780 --> 17:31.780
Add it up

17:31.780 --> 17:32.780
That's it

17:32.780 --> 17:33.780
It's 6 dollars for the lines

17:33.780 --> 17:35.780
You can have as many lines as you want

17:35.780 --> 17:36.780
It's a flat 6 dollars

17:36.780 --> 17:37.780
You can turn them on and off when you need them

17:37.780 --> 17:39.780
And then you just pay for your usage

17:39.780 --> 17:41.780
It doesn't matter if it's a data device or a smart phone

17:41.780 --> 17:42.780
No contracts

17:42.780 --> 17:43.780
No early termination fee

17:43.780 --> 17:45.780
An incredible, incredible dashboard

17:45.780 --> 17:49.780
And no whole customer service when you call them at 1855-TING-FTW

17:49.780 --> 17:51.780
A real person answers the phone

17:51.780 --> 17:53.780
Just got a call between 8am and 8pm on business hours

17:53.780 --> 17:54.780
They're not animals

17:54.780 --> 17:58.780
But go to linux.ting.com and try out that savings calculator right there on the screen

17:58.780 --> 17:59.780
You click that

17:59.780 --> 18:00.780
Go in there

18:00.780 --> 18:01.780
Put in your current usage information

18:01.780 --> 18:02.780
Like for example

18:02.780 --> 18:03.780
Let's just

18:03.780 --> 18:05.780
I don't even remember what I used to use anymore

18:05.780 --> 18:06.780
But let's just say I use

18:06.780 --> 18:07.780
Yeah right

18:07.780 --> 18:08.780
Let's say I use 300 minutes

18:08.780 --> 18:09.780
I'm not a big talker

18:09.780 --> 18:11.780
And 200 text messages

18:11.780 --> 18:12.780
Well

18:12.780 --> 18:13.780
I mean maybe

18:13.780 --> 18:16.780
I really would probably use Hangouts to be honest with you

18:16.780 --> 18:17.780
So I don't know

18:17.780 --> 18:19.780
But let's say it's 200 messages right

18:19.780 --> 18:20.780
And the megabytes

18:20.780 --> 18:21.780
Let's say it's about

18:21.780 --> 18:24.780
Let's say this month I think I'm probably about 3 gigabytes

18:24.780 --> 18:26.780
And before taxes

18:26.780 --> 18:27.780
That would be normally what?

18:27.780 --> 18:28.780
150 dollars for that cell phone bill?

18:28.780 --> 18:29.780
Oh not 450

18:29.780 --> 18:30.780
150 dollars

18:30.780 --> 18:32.780
Now you go into the Ting savings calculator

18:32.780 --> 18:33.780
If you've got multiple lines

18:33.780 --> 18:34.780
You put that in there

18:34.780 --> 18:35.780
You put your actual usage in there

18:35.780 --> 18:36.780
And you can calculate the savings

18:36.780 --> 18:37.780
And see how much you would save

18:37.780 --> 18:39.780
They can do some data scraping as well

18:39.780 --> 18:40.780
But just at that

18:40.780 --> 18:41.780
Which is a fairly moderate plan

18:41.780 --> 18:42.780
You probably are using more than that

18:42.780 --> 18:43.780
A lot of you

18:43.780 --> 18:45.780
You'd save 2,000 dollars

18:45.780 --> 18:46.780
And if you're using less

18:46.780 --> 18:47.780
You'd save even more

18:47.780 --> 18:48.780
That's what's so great about the Ting model

18:48.780 --> 18:49.780
It's so sweet

18:49.780 --> 18:50.780
Go over there right now

18:50.780 --> 18:51.780
Linux.ting.com

18:51.780 --> 18:52.780
Check them out

18:52.780 --> 18:53.780
See why Ting is mobile

18:53.780 --> 18:54.780
That makes sense

18:54.780 --> 18:56.780
And when you're playing around with that savings calculator

18:56.780 --> 18:58.780
Don't be surprised if it brings a tear to your eye

18:58.780 --> 18:59.780
When you see that money

18:59.780 --> 19:00.780
You're like gosh

19:00.780 --> 19:01.780
That's a laptop I could buy every couple of years

19:01.780 --> 19:03.780
And also I think this is pretty cool

19:03.780 --> 19:06.780
They've been spotlighting different Ting customers on the Ting blog

19:06.780 --> 19:08.780
And they've got an adorable new baby

19:08.780 --> 19:10.780
Oh look at that girl with those pretty blue eyes

19:10.780 --> 19:11.780
Let's go over to the Ting blog

19:11.780 --> 19:13.780
And check out the Ting customers

19:13.780 --> 19:14.780
Their app pics

19:14.780 --> 19:15.780
Information about Ting

19:15.780 --> 19:17.780
Their blog post about their consumer reports rating

19:17.780 --> 19:18.780
That was excellent

19:18.780 --> 19:19.780
They've got all the kinds of good info

19:19.780 --> 19:21.780
Gives you some behind the scenes information about Ting

19:21.780 --> 19:24.780
It kind of gives you a better idea of where your money is going

19:24.780 --> 19:26.780
And I think that's all pretty important to a lot of us

19:26.780 --> 19:27.780
Linux.ting.com

19:27.780 --> 19:30.780
Get a 25 dollar discount on your first Ting device

19:30.780 --> 19:31.780
With no contract

19:31.780 --> 19:33.780
No early termination fee

19:33.780 --> 19:35.780
You own that phone

19:35.780 --> 19:36.780
Like your computer

19:36.780 --> 19:37.780
You know

19:37.780 --> 19:38.780
I know

19:38.780 --> 19:39.780
It's crazy

19:39.780 --> 19:40.780
And it's not actually

19:40.780 --> 19:41.780
You know what's funny

19:41.780 --> 19:42.780
Is people outside the US

19:42.780 --> 19:44.780
Like some of our listeners

19:44.780 --> 19:46.780
Live in areas where the cell phone system

19:46.780 --> 19:47.780
Makes a lot more sense

19:47.780 --> 19:48.780
And they hear this stuff

19:48.780 --> 19:49.780
And they're like wait a minute

19:49.780 --> 19:50.780
You guys pay subsidies

19:50.780 --> 19:52.780
You realize you pay more in the long run

19:52.780 --> 19:53.780
You realize they're scamming you

19:53.780 --> 19:54.780
And I don't know if you heard

19:54.780 --> 19:58.780
But Verizon just like extended the early termination fee

19:58.780 --> 19:59.780
Even further out now

19:59.780 --> 20:01.780
And with a higher rate

20:01.780 --> 20:03.780
Like they just keep getting worse

20:03.780 --> 20:04.780
They're not getting any better

20:04.780 --> 20:06.780
Linux.ting.com

20:06.780 --> 20:07.780
Go make a difference for yourself

20:07.780 --> 20:08.780
And go vote with your wallet

20:08.780 --> 20:10.780
Linux.ting.com

20:10.780 --> 20:11.780
And a big thank you to Ting

20:11.780 --> 20:12.780
For sponsoring

20:12.780 --> 20:13.780
Linux Unplugged

20:13.780 --> 20:14.780
Okay

20:14.780 --> 20:16.780
Just a couple more emails to get to

20:16.780 --> 20:17.780
This is

20:17.780 --> 20:20.780
You know when we started the Linux Unplugged show

20:20.780 --> 20:22.780
The initial concept for Linux Unplugged

20:22.780 --> 20:23.780
Was actually going to be

20:23.780 --> 20:25.780
Just 100% emails

20:25.780 --> 20:26.780
I remember that

20:26.780 --> 20:27.780
You remember that

20:27.780 --> 20:28.780
Yeah right

20:28.780 --> 20:29.780
Like I was like Matt

20:29.780 --> 20:30.780
We get too many emails

20:30.780 --> 20:31.780
We should have a show

20:31.780 --> 20:32.780
Where we just read emails

20:32.780 --> 20:33.780
So that's why we do emails

20:33.780 --> 20:34.780
At the beginning of the show

20:34.780 --> 20:35.780
Because that's the heritage

20:35.780 --> 20:36.780
Of Linux Unplugged

20:36.780 --> 20:37.780
It's like okay

20:37.780 --> 20:38.780
This is bad

20:38.780 --> 20:40.780
These emails are just sitting in the inbox

20:40.780 --> 20:41.780
And now we still have the same problem

20:41.780 --> 20:43.780
But we at least get to some of them

20:43.780 --> 20:44.780
So that's good

20:44.780 --> 20:45.780
Alright

20:45.780 --> 20:46.780
Mandaray writes in

20:46.780 --> 20:47.780
With yet another System D survey

20:47.780 --> 20:48.780
This is up to you

20:48.780 --> 20:49.780
Dear audience

20:49.780 --> 20:50.780
But he wanted to let us know

20:50.780 --> 20:51.780
That he's created another System D survey

20:51.780 --> 20:53.780
Unlike the one we ran previously

20:53.780 --> 20:54.780
This one aims to figure out

20:54.780 --> 20:55.780
What groups of users

20:55.780 --> 20:56.780
Are in favor of System D

20:56.780 --> 20:57.780
And which are against it

20:57.780 --> 20:58.780
And who is a vocal

20:58.780 --> 20:59.780
And who is

20:59.780 --> 21:00.780
You know

21:00.780 --> 21:01.780
All the kind of nuances around that

21:01.780 --> 21:02.780
He says hopefully

21:02.780 --> 21:04.780
He wants to find more discussion around it

21:04.780 --> 21:05.780
He's already compiled

21:05.780 --> 21:06.780
Some of the interesting information

21:06.780 --> 21:07.780
Not only about System D

21:07.780 --> 21:08.780
But other topics too

21:08.780 --> 21:09.780
Which might be worth discussing

21:09.780 --> 21:10.780
In future episodes

21:10.780 --> 21:11.780
However

21:11.780 --> 21:13.780
Because he's kind of running this on his own

21:13.780 --> 21:14.780
We haven't talked about it anywhere

21:14.780 --> 21:15.780
He's only gotten about

21:15.780 --> 21:16.780
240 participants so far

21:16.780 --> 21:18.780
So I have a link in the show notes

21:18.780 --> 21:19.780
If you'd like to take yet another

21:19.780 --> 21:20.780
System D survey

21:20.780 --> 21:21.780
That also asks some other questions

21:21.780 --> 21:22.780
And you never know

21:22.780 --> 21:23.780
We might get some good weekly

21:23.780 --> 21:24.780
Conversation out of it

21:24.780 --> 21:25.780
For a little bit

21:25.780 --> 21:26.780
So thanks to Mandaray

21:26.780 --> 21:27.780
For writing that

21:27.780 --> 21:28.780
It's a Google form

21:28.780 --> 21:29.780
You know these Google forms

21:29.780 --> 21:30.780
Are actually really handy

21:30.780 --> 21:31.780
If you haven't checked them out

21:31.780 --> 21:32.780
Because they output all of the results

21:32.780 --> 21:33.780
I mean you know me

21:33.780 --> 21:34.780
I'm not like Mr. Google over here

21:34.780 --> 21:36.780
But they output all of the results

21:36.780 --> 21:37.780
Right into a spreadsheet

21:37.780 --> 21:39.780
And that's just undeniably handy

21:39.780 --> 21:40.780
In fact we have one

21:40.780 --> 21:41.780
That I'm going to talk about

21:41.780 --> 21:42.780
At the end of the show

21:42.780 --> 21:43.780
For us

21:43.780 --> 21:44.780
So I'll have a link to his survey

21:44.780 --> 21:45.780
In the show notes

21:45.780 --> 21:46.780
If you guys want to try it

21:46.780 --> 21:47.780
Cool

21:47.780 --> 21:48.780
Yeah

21:48.780 --> 21:49.780
And maybe we can dig

21:49.780 --> 21:50.780
Through the results later

21:50.780 --> 21:51.780
Alright

21:51.780 --> 21:52.780
Here's the big one

21:52.780 --> 21:53.780
That I've been waiting to get to

21:53.780 --> 21:54.780
I know Rotten Corpse

21:54.780 --> 21:55.780
Is going to have some stuff

21:55.780 --> 21:56.780
To talk about that

21:56.780 --> 21:57.780
So I'll give him a chance

21:57.780 --> 21:58.780
To jump in first

21:58.780 --> 21:59.780
Once I read this one

21:59.780 --> 22:00.780
So on Coda Radio yesterday

22:00.780 --> 22:01.780
I mentioned that

22:01.780 --> 22:02.780
I have

22:02.780 --> 22:03.780
I have a dream Matt

22:03.780 --> 22:04.780
I have a dream

22:04.780 --> 22:05.780
You have a dream

22:05.780 --> 22:07.780
Of going into the Jupiter Broadcasting

22:07.780 --> 22:08.780
WordPress directory

22:08.780 --> 22:10.780
Typing rm-rf star

22:10.780 --> 22:11.780
And hitting enter

22:11.780 --> 22:12.780
I want

22:12.780 --> 22:13.780
I'm done with WordPress

22:13.780 --> 22:14.780
It's great

22:14.780 --> 22:15.780
It's super sweet

22:15.780 --> 22:16.780
If you run a blog

22:16.780 --> 22:17.780
Anything like that

22:17.780 --> 22:18.780
Great open source project

22:18.780 --> 22:20.780
I don't want to use WordPress anymore

22:20.780 --> 22:21.780
I don't need a CMS

22:21.780 --> 22:22.780
I don't want a CMS

22:22.780 --> 22:23.780
All I want to do

22:23.780 --> 22:24.780
Is put an HTML5 video

22:24.780 --> 22:25.780
Up on a webpage

22:25.780 --> 22:26.780
With some download links

22:26.780 --> 22:27.780
And some text that tells you

22:27.780 --> 22:28.780
What that video is about

22:28.780 --> 22:29.780
That's all I want Matt

22:29.780 --> 22:30.780
I want to take a flat markdown file

22:30.780 --> 22:31.780
I want to drop in a directory

22:31.780 --> 22:32.780
And I want that to publish

22:32.780 --> 22:33.780
Up on the web

22:33.780 --> 22:34.780
I don't want a database

22:34.780 --> 22:35.780
I don't want nothing dynamic

22:35.780 --> 22:36.780
None of it

22:36.780 --> 22:37.780
Reach it

22:37.780 --> 22:38.780
Static HTML

22:38.780 --> 22:39.780
Simple easy

22:39.780 --> 22:40.780
Boom shakalaka

22:40.780 --> 22:41.780
I hear you

22:41.780 --> 22:42.780
So on Coda Radio 129

22:42.780 --> 22:43.780
I went on

22:43.780 --> 22:44.780
About my fantasy

22:44.780 --> 22:45.780
Of replacing WordPress

22:45.780 --> 22:46.780
With something more

22:46.780 --> 22:47.780
Quote unquote

22:47.780 --> 22:48.780
Sane as

22:48.780 --> 22:49.780
It was written here

22:49.780 --> 22:50.780
Up in this

22:50.780 --> 22:51.780
Subreddit post

22:51.780 --> 22:52.780
So here's the

22:52.780 --> 22:53.780
There's a bunch of great suggestions

22:53.780 --> 22:54.780
In this post

22:54.780 --> 22:55.780
Of what Jupiter Broadcasting

22:55.780 --> 22:56.780
Could do

22:56.780 --> 22:57.780
To move away from WordPress

22:57.780 --> 22:58.780
Let me tell you

22:58.780 --> 22:59.780
What I'm thinking about here

22:59.780 --> 23:00.780
Because I'd love to get the audience

23:00.780 --> 23:01.780
I'm sure there's some people out

23:01.780 --> 23:02.780
That have done this kind of thing

23:02.780 --> 23:04.780
I really want something

23:04.780 --> 23:05.780
Very simple

23:05.780 --> 23:08.780
That would allow us to import

23:08.780 --> 23:09.780
Somehow

23:09.780 --> 23:10.780
I don't know how we would do it

23:10.780 --> 23:11.780
All of the back catalog

23:11.780 --> 23:12.780
Of the existing post

23:12.780 --> 23:13.780
So we could go

23:13.780 --> 23:14.780
Pull in

23:14.780 --> 23:15.780
All of the previous shows

23:15.780 --> 23:17.780
Not mess with all the time stamps

23:17.780 --> 23:18.780
Keep all the tags

23:18.780 --> 23:20.780
Something that could extract it

23:20.780 --> 23:22.780
From the MySQL WordPress database

23:22.780 --> 23:23.780
And put it into this new system

23:23.780 --> 23:24.780
So that's one thing

23:24.780 --> 23:25.780
I want to get done

23:25.780 --> 23:26.780
I'm thinking like

23:26.780 --> 23:27.780
After the holidays

23:27.780 --> 23:28.780
So not like right now

23:28.780 --> 23:29.780
Probably after New Years

23:29.780 --> 23:31.780
And put this all

23:31.780 --> 23:32.780
Put this

23:32.780 --> 23:33.780
I'm trying to put something together

23:33.780 --> 23:34.780
And I'm looking for people's

23:34.780 --> 23:35.780
Suggestions right now

23:35.780 --> 23:36.780
On how we could pull off

23:36.780 --> 23:37.780
What we could use

23:37.780 --> 23:39.780
And any tools that might be useful

23:39.780 --> 23:40.780
In a transition like this

23:40.780 --> 23:41.780
It's really early day stuff

23:41.780 --> 23:42.780
Just starting to think about it

23:42.780 --> 23:44.780
But Rotten Corps

23:44.780 --> 23:46.780
You were looking at PicoCMS

23:46.780 --> 23:47.780
I know

23:47.780 --> 23:49.780
I think Alan is using PicoCMS

23:49.780 --> 23:50.780
To run the bsdnow.tv site

23:50.780 --> 23:51.780
And he says

23:51.780 --> 23:52.780
It essentially does

23:52.780 --> 23:53.780
Kind of what I was talking about

23:53.780 --> 23:54.780
They run the whole site

23:54.780 --> 23:55.780
Off of markdown files

23:55.780 --> 23:57.780
And some CSS tweaks, right?

23:57.780 --> 23:58.780
Yeah

23:58.780 --> 23:59.780
It's not just

23:59.780 --> 24:00.780
It's not limited to just markdown

24:00.780 --> 24:01.780
But it does

24:01.780 --> 24:02.780
It does have a lot of

24:02.780 --> 24:04.780
Focus on markdown

24:04.780 --> 24:05.780
So what do you think?

24:05.780 --> 24:06.780
Am I crazy?

24:06.780 --> 24:08.780
No, actually for JB

24:08.780 --> 24:09.780
It makes a lot of sense

24:09.780 --> 24:12.780
Because the biggest bottleneck

24:12.780 --> 24:13.780
For a CMS

24:13.780 --> 24:14.780
Is the constant checking

24:14.780 --> 24:16.780
The database for the content

24:16.780 --> 24:17.780
And if it's just

24:17.780 --> 24:19.780
For the episodes

24:19.780 --> 24:20.780
You don't need to go back

24:20.780 --> 24:21.780
And change the show notes

24:21.780 --> 24:22.780
Because once the show's out

24:22.780 --> 24:23.780
The show's out

24:23.780 --> 24:25.780
So a static file

24:25.780 --> 24:26.780
Would make perfect sense

24:26.780 --> 24:27.780
For JB

24:27.780 --> 24:29.780
And the entire structure

24:29.780 --> 24:31.780
Would make sense to each other

24:31.780 --> 24:33.780
Pico looks really good

24:33.780 --> 24:34.780
I'm also looking at Pelican

24:34.780 --> 24:35.780
But so far

24:35.780 --> 24:36.780
Pico is kind of like

24:36.780 --> 24:37.780
The front runner

24:37.780 --> 24:39.780
But there are many other options

24:39.780 --> 24:40.780
That I'm looking at

24:40.780 --> 24:42.780
A few suggestions people gave

24:42.780 --> 24:44.780
Were actually

24:44.780 --> 24:45.780
Have been discontinued

24:45.780 --> 24:46.780
Oh, really?

24:46.780 --> 24:47.780
So there's

24:47.780 --> 24:48.780
About half of the ones

24:48.780 --> 24:49.780
That were suggested

24:49.780 --> 24:50.780
Were not viable

24:50.780 --> 24:52.780
But Pico does look like

24:52.780 --> 24:53.780
A good option

24:53.780 --> 24:54.780
Now, MB

24:54.780 --> 24:55.780
You've done some migrations

24:55.780 --> 24:56.780
I noticed you mentioned

24:56.780 --> 24:57.780
mate-desktop.org

24:57.780 --> 25:00.780
And ubuntu-mate.org

25:00.780 --> 25:01.780
You mentioned those as reference

25:01.780 --> 25:02.780
Have you migrated those

25:02.780 --> 25:03.780
Specific sites from WordPress

25:03.780 --> 25:05.780
Or what's that been like for you?

25:05.780 --> 25:06.780
So, yeah

25:06.780 --> 25:07.780
So I migrated my own site

25:07.780 --> 25:09.780
From WordPress

25:09.780 --> 25:10.780
To Nicola

25:10.780 --> 25:11.780
Which is a static site generator

25:11.780 --> 25:13.780
A couple of years ago

25:13.780 --> 25:14.780
And Nicola has a

25:14.780 --> 25:16.780
WordPress migration tool

25:16.780 --> 25:18.780
So you can migrate

25:18.780 --> 25:20.780
All your pages and blog posts

25:20.780 --> 25:22.780
And it also has

25:22.780 --> 25:23.780
Well, no

25:23.780 --> 25:24.780
You don't need to use Nicola

25:24.780 --> 25:25.780
For this

25:25.780 --> 25:26.780
Within WordPress

25:26.780 --> 25:27.780
You can export

25:27.780 --> 25:28.780
All your comments

25:28.780 --> 25:29.780
As XML

25:29.780 --> 25:30.780
And then you can load

25:30.780 --> 25:32.780
Those into Disqus

25:32.780 --> 25:33.780
And then you can link

25:33.780 --> 25:34.780
Your static site

25:34.780 --> 25:36.780
Generated with Nicola

25:36.780 --> 25:37.780
To the Disqus account

25:37.780 --> 25:38.780
Where your comments

25:38.780 --> 25:39.780
Have been imported

25:39.780 --> 25:40.780
And retain all of your

25:40.780 --> 25:42.780
Comment history as well

25:42.780 --> 25:44.780
So I migrated my own site

25:44.780 --> 25:45.780
To Nicola

25:45.780 --> 25:46.780
Because I wanted

25:46.780 --> 25:48.780
A static site generator

25:48.780 --> 25:50.780
I wanted a really easy way

25:50.780 --> 25:51.780
To deploy the website

25:51.780 --> 25:52.780
And I spend a lot of time

25:52.780 --> 25:53.780
In the shell

25:53.780 --> 25:54.780
And I just wanted

25:54.780 --> 25:55.780
To be able to open up

25:55.780 --> 25:56.780
My text editor

25:56.780 --> 25:57.780
Bashing some words

25:57.780 --> 25:58.780
And publish

25:58.780 --> 26:00.780
And everything for my site

26:00.780 --> 26:03.780
Is done in Markdown

26:03.780 --> 26:04.780
So if you look at

26:04.780 --> 26:06.780
The Ubuntu Mate website

26:06.780 --> 26:07.780
That is all Markdown

26:07.780 --> 26:09.780
That's rendered into HTML

26:09.780 --> 26:10.780
By Nicola

26:10.780 --> 26:12.780
And you just manage

26:12.780 --> 26:13.780
A theme

26:13.780 --> 26:15.780
That is then applied

26:15.780 --> 26:16.780
To the Markdown

26:16.780 --> 26:18.780
So I found Nicola

26:18.780 --> 26:19.780
To be really great

26:19.780 --> 26:20.780
And I actually use

26:20.780 --> 26:21.780
BitSync as my

26:21.780 --> 26:22.780
Deployment mechanism

26:22.780 --> 26:25.780
So my sites are in BitSync

26:25.780 --> 26:26.780
And you edit the Markdown

26:26.780 --> 26:28.780
And then I touch a file

26:28.780 --> 26:29.780
In there to say publish

26:29.780 --> 26:31.780
And a cron job on the server

26:31.780 --> 26:33.780
Looks for the published file

26:33.780 --> 26:34.780
Runs the Nicola

26:34.780 --> 26:35.780
Static site generation

26:35.780 --> 26:36.780
And then R syncs

26:36.780 --> 26:38.780
The generated site

26:38.780 --> 26:40.780
To the web group

26:40.780 --> 26:41.780
I was thinking of maybe

26:41.780 --> 26:42.780
I mean BitTorrent sync

26:42.780 --> 26:43.780
Is pretty sweet too

26:43.780 --> 26:44.780
I was thinking of like

26:44.780 --> 26:45.780
A GitHub

26:45.780 --> 26:46.780
Like a git deployment

26:46.780 --> 26:47.780
Like check in, check out

26:47.780 --> 26:48.780
Push kind of thing

26:48.780 --> 26:49.780
Yeah, I know

26:49.780 --> 26:50.780
I've used things like that

26:50.780 --> 26:51.780
Too complicated?

26:51.780 --> 26:52.780
It's a bit of a

26:52.780 --> 26:55.780
Well, for my own sites

26:55.780 --> 26:57.780
It is, although as it happens

26:57.780 --> 26:59.780
The mate-desktop.org

26:59.780 --> 27:01.780
Website is powered by Nicola

27:01.780 --> 27:04.780
And that's in git hub

27:04.780 --> 27:06.780
And periodically the server

27:06.780 --> 27:08.780
Checks out the git hub

27:08.780 --> 27:09.780
And rebuilds the site

27:09.780 --> 27:10.780
And deploys it

27:10.780 --> 27:12.780
So that's familiar for

27:12.780 --> 27:13.780
For the developers

27:13.780 --> 27:15.780
Who know the git workflow

27:15.780 --> 27:16.780
For my own stuff

27:16.780 --> 27:17.780
It's currently in BitSync

27:17.780 --> 27:18.780
But I'm going to put

27:18.780 --> 27:19.780
The Mate desktop

27:19.780 --> 27:22.780
The Ubuntu Mate site

27:22.780 --> 27:24.780
Into either Git or Bazaar

27:24.780 --> 27:25.780
So that I can get some

27:25.780 --> 27:27.780
Translators involved

27:27.780 --> 27:28.780
Because Nicola has also got

27:28.780 --> 27:31.780
Multilingual facilities as well

27:31.780 --> 27:33.780
So you can do translations

27:33.780 --> 27:34.780
I like the WordPress

27:34.780 --> 27:35.780
Conversion built in

27:35.780 --> 27:36.780
Yeah, go ahead

27:36.780 --> 27:37.780
What I would recommend is

27:37.780 --> 27:39.780
Setting up a Gitolite server

27:39.780 --> 27:41.780
On your DigitalOcean droplet

27:41.780 --> 27:43.780
And this is what I do in fact

27:43.780 --> 27:45.780
And you push a change

27:45.780 --> 27:46.780
And you can have Gitolite

27:46.780 --> 27:47.780
Call a hook

27:47.780 --> 27:49.780
And that hook could be

27:49.780 --> 27:51.780
To rebuild the static site

27:51.780 --> 27:53.780
Okay, oh this is exciting

27:53.780 --> 27:55.780
Okay, so how do you handle

27:55.780 --> 27:57.780
Like changes to like

27:57.780 --> 27:59.780
So if you

27:59.780 --> 28:01.780
How do you like for example

28:01.780 --> 28:02.780
In Jupyter Broadcasting

28:02.780 --> 28:03.780
Let's say we had a thumbnail

28:03.780 --> 28:04.780
And we want to change

28:04.780 --> 28:05.780
Thumbnail on one of the

28:05.780 --> 28:06.780
On one of the stills

28:06.780 --> 28:07.780
How do you regenerate

28:07.780 --> 28:08.780
Like a front page

28:08.780 --> 28:09.780
What generates that

28:09.780 --> 28:10.780
Is the Nicola software

28:10.780 --> 28:11.780
Taking care of that

28:11.780 --> 28:12.780
What's doing that part

28:12.780 --> 28:13.780
Yeah, yeah

28:13.780 --> 28:14.780
So the way Nicola works

28:14.780 --> 28:16.780
Is it knows the hashes

28:16.780 --> 28:18.780
Of all of the source files

28:18.780 --> 28:19.780
And it knows the hashes

28:19.780 --> 28:21.780
Of all of the configuration

28:21.780 --> 28:23.780
And the files that get generated

28:23.780 --> 28:25.780
So if for example

28:25.780 --> 28:27.780
You change an asset

28:27.780 --> 28:29.780
Every page where that asset

28:29.780 --> 28:31.780
Is used will automatically

28:31.780 --> 28:32.780
Be generated

28:32.780 --> 28:34.780
So when I did that deployment

28:34.780 --> 28:36.780
Of Ubuntu Marte

28:36.780 --> 28:38.780
A couple of weeks ago

28:38.780 --> 28:40.780
The release part was running

28:40.780 --> 28:41.780
Nicola

28:41.780 --> 28:42.780
And it's two commands

28:42.780 --> 28:44.780
Nicola build

28:44.780 --> 28:46.780
Which builds all of the pages

28:46.780 --> 28:48.780
And pulls in all of the assets

28:48.780 --> 28:50.780
And then Nicola deploy

28:50.780 --> 28:51.780
Which is then

28:51.780 --> 28:52.780
Calls a script of your own

28:52.780 --> 28:54.780
To actually push it somewhere

28:54.780 --> 28:55.780
And what I've done is

28:55.780 --> 28:56.780
I've added a couple of

28:56.780 --> 28:58.780
Extra deployment pieces

28:58.780 --> 28:59.780
Which are scripts

28:59.780 --> 29:00.780
That automatically

29:00.780 --> 29:02.780
Sim link the ISO images

29:02.780 --> 29:04.780
And stuff like that

29:04.780 --> 29:06.780
And does it handle things

29:06.780 --> 29:07.780
Like responsive design

29:07.780 --> 29:08.780
And stuff like that

29:08.780 --> 29:09.780
Or is that a little tricky

29:09.780 --> 29:10.780
It does

29:10.780 --> 29:11.780
Yeah, go and open

29:11.780 --> 29:12.780
Ubuntu Marte.org on your phone

29:12.780 --> 29:13.780
And have a look

29:13.780 --> 29:14.780
It's automatic

29:14.780 --> 29:15.780
Yeah, it actually works

29:15.780 --> 29:16.780
On the browser too, yeah

29:20.780 --> 29:21.780
So the way that that's handled

29:21.780 --> 29:22.780
Is I've cheated

29:22.780 --> 29:24.780
And Nicola supports

29:24.780 --> 29:25.780
Bootstrap

29:25.780 --> 29:27.780
One of the themes

29:27.780 --> 29:29.780
So I just went to Boot Swatch

29:29.780 --> 29:30.780
Found a theme that was

29:30.780 --> 29:31.780
Broadly what I wanted

29:31.780 --> 29:32.780
And then just tweaked it

29:32.780 --> 29:34.780
And then I got all the benefits

29:34.780 --> 29:36.780
Of Bootstrap and Boot Swatch

29:36.780 --> 29:37.780
I didn't have to do much work

29:37.780 --> 29:38.780
That's pretty great

29:38.780 --> 29:40.780
That's a lot of great

29:40.780 --> 29:41.780
It sounds a lot

29:41.780 --> 29:42.780
Up our alley

29:42.780 --> 29:43.780
And does it do

29:43.780 --> 29:44.780
I'm sure

29:44.780 --> 29:45.780
Sorry

29:45.780 --> 29:46.780
Does it do any feed generation

29:46.780 --> 29:47.780
Or anything like that

29:47.780 --> 29:48.780
For RSS feeds

29:48.780 --> 29:49.780
Yeah, it generates

29:49.780 --> 29:50.780
RSS feeds

29:50.780 --> 29:51.780
And it can do

29:51.780 --> 29:52.780
Podcast stuff

29:52.780 --> 29:53.780
And a whole bunch

29:53.780 --> 29:54.780
Of other things

29:54.780 --> 29:55.780
And it's not limited

29:55.780 --> 29:56.780
To Markdown either

29:56.780 --> 29:57.780
So it also supports

29:57.780 --> 29:58.780
Restructured text

29:58.780 --> 30:00.780
And BB code

30:00.780 --> 30:01.780
And just about every kind

30:01.780 --> 30:02.780
Of text render

30:02.780 --> 30:03.780
You can imagine

30:03.780 --> 30:04.780
Really?

30:04.780 --> 30:06.780
Yeah, all of those

30:06.780 --> 30:07.780
And so on the

30:07.780 --> 30:10.780
Marte Desktop.org website

30:10.780 --> 30:11.780
The front page

30:11.780 --> 30:12.780
Is actually

30:12.780 --> 30:13.780
Restructured text

30:13.780 --> 30:14.780
Because I needed

30:14.780 --> 30:15.780
Some of the facilities

30:15.780 --> 30:16.780
Of restructured text

30:16.780 --> 30:18.780
But all of the other pages

30:18.780 --> 30:19.780
Are Markdown

30:19.780 --> 30:20.780
That's cool

30:20.780 --> 30:21.780
So this is sounding

30:21.780 --> 30:22.780
Pretty doable

30:22.780 --> 30:23.780
I wonder

30:23.780 --> 30:24.780
But I'm sure

30:24.780 --> 30:25.780
What Nicola does

30:25.780 --> 30:26.780
Is not that different

30:26.780 --> 30:27.780
From what a lot

30:27.780 --> 30:28.780
Of the other static site

30:28.780 --> 30:29.780
Generators do

30:29.780 --> 30:30.780
But what you get

30:30.780 --> 30:31.780
Of course

30:31.780 --> 30:32.780
Is you get some real

30:32.780 --> 30:33.780
Security benefits

30:33.780 --> 30:34.780
Because you're not running

30:34.780 --> 30:35.780
An interpreted language

30:35.780 --> 30:36.780
On your web server

30:36.780 --> 30:38.780
So you can't be exploited

30:38.780 --> 30:39.780
And the other thing

30:39.780 --> 30:40.780
You can do

30:40.780 --> 30:41.780
Is then trivially

30:41.780 --> 30:42.780
Hook it up

30:42.780 --> 30:43.780
To your CDN

30:43.780 --> 30:44.780
To cache

30:44.780 --> 30:45.780
All of the assets

30:45.780 --> 30:46.780
Like your CSS

30:46.780 --> 30:47.780
And your JavaScript

30:47.780 --> 30:48.780
Exactly

30:48.780 --> 30:49.780
So I then integrate

30:49.780 --> 30:50.780
My sites

30:50.780 --> 30:51.780
With Cloudflare

30:51.780 --> 30:52.780
And that absorbs

30:52.780 --> 30:53.780
Gobs of bandwidth

30:53.780 --> 30:54.780
That I don't have

30:54.780 --> 30:55.780
To serve out

30:55.780 --> 30:56.780
Through my own servers

30:56.780 --> 30:58.780
That is excellent

30:58.780 --> 30:59.780
And my

30:59.780 --> 31:00.780
Really ultimate

31:00.780 --> 31:01.780
Envision

31:01.780 --> 31:02.780
I don't know

31:02.780 --> 31:04.780
When this would ever be done

31:04.780 --> 31:05.780
But the file

31:05.780 --> 31:06.780
Comes out of

31:06.780 --> 31:07.780
The editing software

31:07.780 --> 31:08.780
Whatever it is

31:08.780 --> 31:09.780
At this point in time

31:09.780 --> 31:10.780
And it's then

31:10.780 --> 31:11.780
Ran through

31:11.780 --> 31:12.780
We currently have

31:12.780 --> 31:13.780
A pretty nice

31:13.780 --> 31:14.780
Bash script

31:14.780 --> 31:15.780
That Rekai's put together

31:15.780 --> 31:16.780
To handle all

31:16.780 --> 31:17.780
Of our encoding

31:17.780 --> 31:18.780
And metadata tagging

31:18.780 --> 31:19.780
And the different versions

31:19.780 --> 31:20.780
Of all the different files

31:20.780 --> 31:21.780
And the, you know

31:21.780 --> 31:22.780
It spits them all out

31:22.780 --> 31:23.780
It would be amazing

31:23.780 --> 31:24.780
Then to have something

31:24.780 --> 31:25.780
Like that

31:25.780 --> 31:26.780
That would

31:26.780 --> 31:27.780
Then take a

31:27.780 --> 31:28.780
Markdown file, right?

31:28.780 --> 31:29.780
And put it somewhere

31:29.780 --> 31:30.780
Where it could get

31:30.780 --> 31:31.780
Absorbed onto the website

31:31.780 --> 31:32.780
And upload these files

31:32.780 --> 31:33.780
To the CDN

31:33.780 --> 31:34.780
Really have it be

31:34.780 --> 31:35.780
The point where

31:35.780 --> 31:36.780
You export out

31:36.780 --> 31:37.780
Of the editing application

31:37.780 --> 31:38.780
You run the bash script

31:38.780 --> 31:39.780
And from that point

31:39.780 --> 31:40.780
Everything is kind of

31:40.780 --> 31:41.780
On autopilot

31:41.780 --> 31:42.780
And it just reduces

31:42.780 --> 31:43.780
Human error

31:43.780 --> 31:44.780
It makes it faster

31:44.780 --> 31:45.780
And the end goal

31:45.780 --> 31:46.780
Would really be

31:46.780 --> 31:47.780
To give us

31:47.780 --> 31:48.780
More time

31:48.780 --> 31:49.780
And more resources

31:49.780 --> 31:50.780
Available to do other things

31:50.780 --> 31:51.780
So that way we don't have

31:51.780 --> 31:52.780
To sit there and babysit

31:52.780 --> 31:53.780
The computer

31:53.780 --> 31:54.780
As it goes through

31:54.780 --> 31:55.780
These tasks

31:55.780 --> 31:56.780
And sit there and upload

31:56.780 --> 31:57.780
It to the FTP

31:57.780 --> 31:58.780
We don't need to do that

31:58.780 --> 31:59.780
It could all be automated

31:59.780 --> 32:00.780
But the key part

32:00.780 --> 32:01.780
I really want to do

32:01.780 --> 32:02.780
Is I want to make sure

32:02.780 --> 32:03.780
The whole web

32:03.780 --> 32:04.780
Posting process

32:04.780 --> 32:05.780
Could be automated as well

32:05.780 --> 32:06.780
And that

32:06.780 --> 32:07.780
You know

32:07.780 --> 32:08.780
It doesn't have to go

32:08.780 --> 32:09.780
And it gets published

32:09.780 --> 32:10.780
On its own

32:10.780 --> 32:11.780
After that

32:11.780 --> 32:12.780
So we'll see

32:12.780 --> 32:13.780
Yeah so

32:13.780 --> 32:14.780
So if you've already

32:14.780 --> 32:15.780
Got an investment

32:15.780 --> 32:16.780
In some scripts

32:16.780 --> 32:17.780
That do some of those

32:17.780 --> 32:18.780
Deployment activities

32:18.780 --> 32:19.780
You can continue

32:19.780 --> 32:20.780
To leverage those

32:20.780 --> 32:21.780
And just integrate

32:21.780 --> 32:22.780
Those as the deployment

32:22.780 --> 32:23.780
Commands within

32:23.780 --> 32:24.780
Nicola

32:24.780 --> 32:25.780
So in the configuration

32:25.780 --> 32:26.780
File it can run

32:26.780 --> 32:27.780
Any number of commands

32:27.780 --> 32:28.780
As part of the deployment

32:28.780 --> 32:29.780
And I've got

32:29.780 --> 32:30.780
Half a dozen shell scripts

32:30.780 --> 32:31.780
That get executed

32:31.780 --> 32:32.780
In my deployment

32:32.780 --> 32:33.780
And I've got

32:33.780 --> 32:34.780
Half a dozen shell scripts

32:34.780 --> 32:35.780
That get executed

32:35.780 --> 32:36.780
In my deployment

32:36.780 --> 32:37.780
One to deposit

32:37.780 --> 32:38.780
The files

32:38.780 --> 32:39.780
In the right place

32:39.780 --> 32:40.780
And then a few other

32:40.780 --> 32:41.780
Bits and pieces

32:41.780 --> 32:42.780
To link up ISO links

32:42.780 --> 32:43.780
And torrents

32:43.780 --> 32:44.780
And stuff like that

32:44.780 --> 32:45.780
So not dissimilar

32:45.780 --> 32:46.780
From what you would

32:46.780 --> 32:47.780
Want to do

32:47.780 --> 32:48.780
With media

32:48.780 --> 32:49.780
And it can be automated

32:49.780 --> 32:50.780
Because cron

32:50.780 --> 32:51.780
Is your friend

32:51.780 --> 32:52.780
Yeah

32:52.780 --> 32:53.780
Wow

32:53.780 --> 32:54.780
I just

32:54.780 --> 32:55.780
Touch a file

32:55.780 --> 32:56.780
And how long

32:56.780 --> 32:57.780
Have you had so far

32:57.780 --> 32:58.780
How long have you

32:58.780 --> 32:59.780
Been using it

32:59.780 --> 33:00.780
In production

33:00.780 --> 33:01.780
On my own

33:01.780 --> 33:02.780
Personal site

33:02.780 --> 33:03.780
For two years

33:03.780 --> 33:04.780
Okay wow

33:04.780 --> 33:05.780
On the mart

33:05.780 --> 33:06.780
A desktop website

33:06.780 --> 33:07.780
For about a year

33:07.780 --> 33:08.780
And obviously

33:08.780 --> 33:09.780
I've been to Marte

33:09.780 --> 33:10.780
Just about five months

33:10.780 --> 33:11.780
So what do you think

33:11.780 --> 33:12.780
Rodden

33:12.780 --> 33:13.780
I think that there's

33:13.780 --> 33:14.780
A now potential battle

33:14.780 --> 33:15.780
Between Nicola and Pico

33:15.780 --> 33:16.780
Good alright

33:16.780 --> 33:17.780
There you go

33:17.780 --> 33:18.780
And if

33:18.780 --> 33:19.780
Out there in the audience

33:19.780 --> 33:20.780
If anybody has some suggestions

33:20.780 --> 33:21.780
There's already a thread

33:21.780 --> 33:22.780
Going in the subreddit

33:22.780 --> 33:23.780
You can toss in

33:23.780 --> 33:24.780
Or you can leave a comment

33:24.780 --> 33:25.780
In the feedback thread

33:25.780 --> 33:26.780
For this episode

33:26.780 --> 33:27.780
It's not that we're

33:27.780 --> 33:28.780
Going to do right away

33:28.780 --> 33:29.780
But it's definitely something

33:29.780 --> 33:30.780
I want to start thinking

33:30.780 --> 33:31.780
About now

33:31.780 --> 33:32.780
So when we do it

33:32.780 --> 33:33.780
We do it right

33:33.780 --> 33:34.780
Oh totally

33:34.780 --> 33:35.780
Well I actually

33:35.780 --> 33:36.780
Threw something to you

33:36.780 --> 33:37.780
In the Skype message in there

33:37.780 --> 33:38.780
So I think it's called Jekyll

33:38.780 --> 33:39.780
It's something I've looked at

33:39.780 --> 33:40.780
In the past

33:40.780 --> 33:41.780
It's very similar to what

33:41.780 --> 33:42.780
You guys were talking about earlier

33:42.780 --> 33:43.780
RSS imports the whole package

33:43.780 --> 33:44.780
Yep yep that's another one

33:44.780 --> 33:45.780
I've heard of too

33:45.780 --> 33:46.780
Yeah Jekyll's looking good

33:46.780 --> 33:47.780
Yeah there's

33:47.780 --> 33:48.780
And Ghost is another one

33:48.780 --> 33:49.780
I've seen a lot of

33:49.780 --> 33:50.780
Common mentions

33:50.780 --> 33:51.780
Yeah so some

33:51.780 --> 33:52.780
Some really interesting

33:52.780 --> 33:53.780
Way more options out there

33:53.780 --> 33:54.780
Than I thought

33:54.780 --> 33:55.780
When I came up with this

33:55.780 --> 33:56.780
Apparently

33:56.780 --> 33:57.780
I'm nowhere near

33:57.780 --> 33:58.780
The first person

33:58.780 --> 33:59.780
To ever think of this idea

33:59.780 --> 34:00.780
Not surprising

34:00.780 --> 34:01.780
Not surprising at all

34:01.780 --> 34:02.780
And you know

34:02.780 --> 34:03.780
I think a big part of that

34:03.780 --> 34:04.780
Is that's why I think

34:04.780 --> 34:05.780
I'm going to mention

34:05.780 --> 34:06.780
Our next sponsor

34:06.780 --> 34:07.780
Over digitalocean.com

34:07.780 --> 34:08.780
I could easily see us

34:08.780 --> 34:09.780
Using a droplet to manage

34:09.780 --> 34:10.780
The deployment

34:10.780 --> 34:11.780
Or take care of

34:11.780 --> 34:12.780
Some testing

34:12.780 --> 34:13.780
In fact there's so many

34:13.780 --> 34:14.780
Amazing things you could use

34:14.780 --> 34:15.780
Digitalocean for

34:15.780 --> 34:16.780
Because you get

34:16.780 --> 34:17.780
Great performance

34:17.780 --> 34:18.780
Great price

34:18.780 --> 34:19.780
And unlimited access

34:19.780 --> 34:20.780
To the machine

34:20.780 --> 34:21.780
Check it out

34:21.780 --> 34:22.780
Digitalocean is a simple

34:22.780 --> 34:23.780
Cloud hosting provider

34:23.780 --> 34:24.780
Dedicated to offering

34:24.780 --> 34:25.780
The most intuitive

34:25.780 --> 34:26.780
And easy way for you

34:26.780 --> 34:27.780
To spin up your own

34:27.780 --> 34:28.780
Cloud server

34:28.780 --> 34:29.780
You get root access

34:29.780 --> 34:30.780
To that bad mamma jamma

34:30.780 --> 34:31.780
HTML5 console access

34:31.780 --> 34:32.780
I know you like that

34:32.780 --> 34:33.780
But you get a

34:33.780 --> 34:34.780
30 second

34:34.780 --> 34:35.780
Benchmark

34:35.780 --> 34:36.780
And it's only 35 seconds

34:36.780 --> 34:37.780
I mean seriously

34:37.780 --> 34:38.780
Like our audience

34:38.780 --> 34:39.780
It's ridiculous

34:39.780 --> 34:40.780
I mean now if you can

34:40.780 --> 34:41.780
If you can get it below 40

34:41.780 --> 34:42.780
You really

34:42.780 --> 34:43.780
The benchmark is

34:43.780 --> 34:44.780
35 seconds

34:44.780 --> 34:45.780
That's when you should

34:45.780 --> 34:46.780
Be tweeting at Chris

34:46.780 --> 34:47.780
If you get it under

34:47.780 --> 34:48.780
35 seconds now

34:48.780 --> 34:49.780
And for $5 a month

34:49.780 --> 34:50.780
You're going to get

34:50.780 --> 34:51.780
512 megabytes of RAM

34:51.780 --> 34:52.780
A 20 gigabyte SSD

34:52.780 --> 34:53.780
One CPU

34:53.780 --> 34:54.780
And a terabyte of

34:54.780 --> 34:55.780
Blazing fast transfer

34:55.780 --> 34:56.780
This connected to

34:56.780 --> 34:57.780
Data centers

34:57.780 --> 34:58.780
All over the world

34:58.780 --> 34:59.780
In New York

34:59.780 --> 35:00.780
San Francisco

35:00.780 --> 35:01.780
Singapore

35:01.780 --> 35:02.780
It's got to be

35:02.780 --> 35:03.780
The best looking

35:03.780 --> 35:04.780
Data centers

35:04.780 --> 35:05.780
I've ever seen

35:05.780 --> 35:06.780
And I know that seems

35:06.780 --> 35:07.780
Like a weird thing

35:07.780 --> 35:08.780
To comment on

35:08.780 --> 35:09.780
But guys

35:09.780 --> 35:10.780
I've been in

35:10.780 --> 35:11.780
A lot of data centers

35:11.780 --> 35:12.780
And they never look as good

35:12.780 --> 35:13.780
It's just

35:13.780 --> 35:14.780
Oh man

35:14.780 --> 35:15.780
I feel like

35:15.780 --> 35:16.780
I want to go back

35:16.780 --> 35:17.780
And just appreciate

35:17.780 --> 35:18.780
A well designed

35:18.780 --> 35:19.780
Data center

35:19.780 --> 35:20.780
Because now that

35:20.780 --> 35:21.780
It's no longer my problem

35:21.780 --> 35:22.780
Oh it's just

35:22.780 --> 35:23.780
It's gorgeous

35:23.780 --> 35:24.780
But it's

35:24.780 --> 35:25.780
It's that interface

35:25.780 --> 35:26.780
That really stands out

35:26.780 --> 35:27.780
I mean it's not just

35:27.780 --> 35:28.780
Their data centers

35:28.780 --> 35:29.780
That look great

35:29.780 --> 35:30.780
It's their interface

35:30.780 --> 35:31.780
They can replicate

35:31.780 --> 35:32.780
The functionality

35:32.780 --> 35:33.780
With their straightforward

35:33.780 --> 35:34.780
API

35:34.780 --> 35:35.780
You can write some scripts

35:35.780 --> 35:36.780
Snap it into your

35:36.780 --> 35:37.780
Puppet management infrastructure

35:37.780 --> 35:38.780
Use one of the

35:38.780 --> 35:39.780
Many applications

35:39.780 --> 35:40.780
Built by the community

35:40.780 --> 35:41.780
They've got all of it

35:41.780 --> 35:42.780
That control panel rocks

35:42.780 --> 35:43.780
And the community support

35:43.780 --> 35:44.780
Around it rocks

35:44.780 --> 35:45.780
DNS management

35:45.780 --> 35:46.780
One click deployment

35:46.780 --> 35:47.780
Of GitLab

35:47.780 --> 35:48.780
You know like

35:48.780 --> 35:49.780
For example

35:49.780 --> 35:50.780
If we were going to

35:50.780 --> 35:51.780
Actually start

35:51.780 --> 35:52.780
When we released an episode

35:52.780 --> 35:53.780
Deploying that

35:53.780 --> 35:54.780
To the website

35:54.780 --> 35:55.780
Via Git

35:55.780 --> 35:56.780
You

35:56.780 --> 35:57.780
You absolutely bet

35:57.780 --> 35:58.780
It would be on a

35:58.780 --> 35:59.780
Self hosted instance

35:59.780 --> 36:00.780
Up on Digital Ocean

36:00.780 --> 36:02.780
No question about it

36:02.780 --> 36:03.780
Not only does that dashboard

36:03.780 --> 36:04.780
Make Git up and going

36:04.780 --> 36:05.780
Super fast and straightforward

36:05.780 --> 36:06.780
Doesn't make

36:06.780 --> 36:07.780
Give me any pause

36:07.780 --> 36:08.780
So I just get right in

36:08.780 --> 36:09.780
Friction free

36:09.780 --> 36:10.780
But it also means that

36:10.780 --> 36:11.780
I'm going to have a

36:11.780 --> 36:12.780
Blazing fast machine

36:12.780 --> 36:13.780
Because Digital Ocean

36:13.780 --> 36:14.780
Has SSDs throughout

36:14.780 --> 36:15.780
They've got great bandwidth

36:15.780 --> 36:16.780
Incredible SSD speeds

36:16.780 --> 36:17.780
It really makes a difference

36:17.780 --> 36:18.780
And it's

36:18.780 --> 36:19.780
It's just all those little things

36:19.780 --> 36:20.780
At every single level

36:20.780 --> 36:21.780
That make them

36:21.780 --> 36:22.780
So incredible

36:22.780 --> 36:23.780
But I also know that

36:23.780 --> 36:24.780
If I ever get stuck

36:24.780 --> 36:25.780
Digital Ocean has

36:25.780 --> 36:26.780
The best tutorials

36:26.780 --> 36:27.780
On the web

36:27.780 --> 36:28.780
And they're getting

36:28.780 --> 36:29.780
Even better

36:29.780 --> 36:30.780
Because Digital Ocean

36:30.780 --> 36:31.780
Is willing to pay

36:31.780 --> 36:32.780
For them

36:32.780 --> 36:33.780
Because they understand

36:33.780 --> 36:34.780
The importance of them

36:34.780 --> 36:35.780
In fact

36:35.780 --> 36:36.780
If you write a tutorial

36:36.780 --> 36:37.780
For Digital Ocean

36:37.780 --> 36:38.780
You could get paid

36:38.780 --> 36:39.780
Up to $200

36:39.780 --> 36:40.780
And they have an editor

36:40.780 --> 36:41.780
That works with you too

36:41.780 --> 36:42.780
So it's not like

36:42.780 --> 36:43.780
It's all on you

36:43.780 --> 36:44.780
And they've had

36:44.780 --> 36:45.780
Such success there

36:45.780 --> 36:46.780
They've opened up

36:46.780 --> 36:47.780
An editing position

36:47.780 --> 36:48.780
So here's what

36:48.780 --> 36:49.780
I want you to do

36:49.780 --> 36:50.780
I want you to try out

36:50.780 --> 36:51.780
Digital Ocean

36:51.780 --> 36:52.780
You can try it for

36:52.780 --> 36:53.780
Two months

36:53.780 --> 36:54.780
For free

36:54.780 --> 36:55.780
To see what I've

36:55.780 --> 36:56.780
Been talking about

36:56.780 --> 36:57.780
Use our promo code

36:57.780 --> 36:58.780
For November

36:58.780 --> 36:59.780
Okay?

36:59.780 --> 37:00.780
You get a $10 credit

37:00.780 --> 37:01.780
You apply that to your account

37:01.780 --> 37:02.780
In fact, I need to go in there

37:02.780 --> 37:03.780
And do that right now

37:03.780 --> 37:04.780
This is another thing

37:04.780 --> 37:05.780
I like a lot about it

37:05.780 --> 37:06.780
Is that you pre-fund the account

37:06.780 --> 37:07.780
And they just send you

37:07.780 --> 37:08.780
A message

37:08.780 --> 37:09.780
Hey

37:09.780 --> 37:10.780
You need to add more funds

37:10.780 --> 37:11.780
This is how I have it set up

37:11.780 --> 37:12.780
I'm sure you could probably

37:12.780 --> 37:13.780
Have it set up multiple ways

37:13.780 --> 37:14.780
So I go in there right now

37:14.780 --> 37:15.780
If I was trying out

37:15.780 --> 37:16.780
Digital Ocean

37:16.780 --> 37:17.780
I put the promo code in

37:17.780 --> 37:18.780
Unplug November

37:18.780 --> 37:19.780
And I get a $10 credit

37:19.780 --> 37:20.780
I think I might go do that

37:20.780 --> 37:21.780
I could be trying it out

37:21.780 --> 37:22.780
Right now

37:22.780 --> 37:23.780
Try it out

37:23.780 --> 37:24.780
Go over there

37:24.780 --> 37:25.780
Get a $5 rig

37:25.780 --> 37:26.780
See what you can do

37:26.780 --> 37:27.780
Because if you need to upgrade

37:27.780 --> 37:28.780
To a beefier box

37:28.780 --> 37:29.780
The pricing tier

37:29.780 --> 37:30.780
Is crazy straight forward

37:30.780 --> 37:31.780
You just go look at the

37:31.780 --> 37:32.780
Pricing plans

37:32.780 --> 37:33.780
Okay, that's easy

37:33.780 --> 37:34.780
That's another $5

37:34.780 --> 37:35.780
That makes sense

37:35.780 --> 37:36.780
Right?

37:36.780 --> 37:37.780
And you could even do

37:37.780 --> 37:38.780
Hourly pricing

37:38.780 --> 37:39.780
So if you just need to

37:39.780 --> 37:40.780
Scale up for a little while

37:40.780 --> 37:41.780
And add some additional capacity

37:41.780 --> 37:42.780
Or you're doing some testing

37:42.780 --> 37:43.780
For a day

37:43.780 --> 37:44.780
Or it's a launch day

37:44.780 --> 37:45.780
Or maybe you're going to do

37:45.780 --> 37:46.780
A gaming server

37:46.780 --> 37:47.780
For a few hours

37:47.780 --> 37:48.780
Hourly pricing

37:48.780 --> 37:49.780
Right?

37:49.780 --> 37:50.780
Because you've got

37:50.780 --> 37:51.780
These snapshots

37:51.780 --> 37:52.780
You can just spin it up

37:52.780 --> 37:53.780
When you need it

37:53.780 --> 37:54.780
For a little while

37:54.780 --> 37:55.780
And then shut it down

37:55.780 --> 37:56.780
For you

37:56.780 --> 37:57.780
To DigitalOcean

37:57.780 --> 37:58.780
For sponsoring

37:58.780 --> 38:00.780
The Linux unplugged program

38:00.780 --> 38:01.780
DigitalOcean.com

38:01.780 --> 38:02.780
Unplugged November

38:02.780 --> 38:03.780
When you check out

38:03.780 --> 38:05.780
I always have like

38:05.780 --> 38:06.780
Whenever now we're talking

38:06.780 --> 38:07.780
About big projects

38:07.780 --> 38:08.780
Somebody's like

38:08.780 --> 38:09.780
Oh, I know what we're going to do

38:09.780 --> 38:10.780
We're going to spin it up

38:10.780 --> 38:11.780
On a DigitalOcean droplet

38:11.780 --> 38:12.780
Is this an excuse

38:12.780 --> 38:13.780
To have a droplet?

38:13.780 --> 38:14.780
That's like me now

38:14.780 --> 38:15.780
It's like I'm ridiculous

38:15.780 --> 38:16.780
Totally

38:16.780 --> 38:17.780
Okay, so I'm pretty excited

38:17.780 --> 38:18.780
So we've been talking with Charlie

38:18.780 --> 38:19.780
And Charlie's there

38:19.780 --> 38:20.780
I'm assuming

38:20.780 --> 38:21.780
I'm picturing it right now

38:21.780 --> 38:22.780
It's a classroom

38:22.780 --> 38:23.780
Probably a whiteboard

38:23.780 --> 38:24.780
And there's like one laptop

38:24.780 --> 38:25.780
In the middle

38:25.780 --> 38:26.780
And like all of these kids

38:26.780 --> 38:27.780
And students

38:27.780 --> 38:28.780
And teachers

38:28.780 --> 38:29.780
And I don't know

38:29.780 --> 38:30.780
Who else?

38:30.780 --> 38:31.780
Maybe Superman

38:31.780 --> 38:32.780
I don't know

38:32.780 --> 38:33.780
Are all sitting around

38:33.780 --> 38:34.780
This laptop to talk to us

38:34.780 --> 38:35.780
So I thought

38:35.780 --> 38:36.780
Charlie told us something

38:36.780 --> 38:37.780
That really struck me

38:37.780 --> 38:38.780
Like wow

38:38.780 --> 38:39.780
This blows my mind

38:39.780 --> 38:40.780
As a previous school

38:40.780 --> 38:41.780
District employee

38:41.780 --> 38:42.780
Some of the students

38:42.780 --> 38:43.780
I'm not sure how many

38:43.780 --> 38:44.780
Maybe it's all

38:44.780 --> 38:45.780
Have root access

38:45.780 --> 38:46.780
To their boxes

38:46.780 --> 38:47.780
And some of the students

38:47.780 --> 38:48.780
Are involved in the help desk

38:48.780 --> 38:49.780
And troubleshooting

38:49.780 --> 38:50.780
Like they get tickets

38:50.780 --> 38:51.780
They go in there

38:51.780 --> 38:52.780
And close tickets

38:52.780 --> 38:53.780
And so Charlie

38:53.780 --> 38:54.780
You could be my eyes

38:54.780 --> 38:55.780
And ears

38:55.780 --> 38:56.780
And hands for me

38:56.780 --> 38:57.780
And pick maybe

38:57.780 --> 38:58.780
A help desk representative

38:58.780 --> 38:59.780
I'd love to ask somebody

38:59.780 --> 39:00.780
I'll start

39:00.780 --> 39:01.780
Here's the question

39:01.780 --> 39:02.780
And then Charlie

39:02.780 --> 39:03.780
I'll let you pick the person

39:03.780 --> 39:04.780
What is a typical

39:04.780 --> 39:05.780
Help desk call

39:05.780 --> 39:06.780
For a student IT person?

39:06.780 --> 39:07.780
What kind of troubleshooting

39:07.780 --> 39:08.780
Do they have to do?

39:08.780 --> 39:09.780
Sure

39:09.780 --> 39:10.780
That's a great question

39:10.780 --> 39:11.780
And I'm looking at

39:11.780 --> 39:12.780
Four gentlemen

39:12.780 --> 39:13.780
That are with me here

39:13.780 --> 39:14.780
And I'm going to let

39:14.780 --> 39:15.780
One of our

39:15.780 --> 39:16.780
Students answer

39:16.780 --> 39:17.780
That question for you

39:17.780 --> 39:18.780
Great

39:18.780 --> 39:19.780
I'm curious

39:19.780 --> 39:20.780
Hello

39:20.780 --> 39:21.780
My name is Taylor

39:21.780 --> 39:22.780
Hey Taylor

39:22.780 --> 39:23.780
Hey Taylor

39:23.780 --> 39:26.780
How's it going?

39:26.780 --> 39:27.780
So what kind of questions

39:27.780 --> 39:28.780
Are you wondering?

39:28.780 --> 39:29.780
Well give me like

39:29.780 --> 39:30.780
A common problem

39:30.780 --> 39:31.780
You run into

39:31.780 --> 39:34.780
Just usually general things

39:34.780 --> 39:37.780
Like why isn't this page loading

39:37.780 --> 39:38.780
And stuff like that

39:38.780 --> 39:39.780
Because I mean

39:39.780 --> 39:40.780
They're not going to go

39:40.780 --> 39:41.780
Too above and beyond

39:41.780 --> 39:43.780
The normal student population

39:43.780 --> 39:44.780
You know what I mean?

39:44.780 --> 39:45.780
Yeah

39:45.780 --> 39:46.780
Well I wonder

39:46.780 --> 39:47.780
Do you ever get people

39:47.780 --> 39:48.780
To throw their hands up

39:48.780 --> 39:49.780
And say I don't know

39:49.780 --> 39:50.780
How this Linux stuff works

39:50.780 --> 39:51.780
What's going on here

39:51.780 --> 39:52.780
This is Linux

39:52.780 --> 39:54.780
And I don't get it?

39:54.780 --> 39:57.780
Actually when we first distributed them

39:57.780 --> 40:00.780
We ran them all through tutorials

40:00.780 --> 40:02.780
When the new freshmen come in

40:02.780 --> 40:04.780
We run them through tutorials

40:04.780 --> 40:05.780
When a new student enrolls

40:05.780 --> 40:07.780
Same deal going on

40:07.780 --> 40:09.780
And they're welcome to stop by

40:09.780 --> 40:10.780
With any questions

40:10.780 --> 40:11.780
Or leave a ticket

40:11.780 --> 40:13.780
If they can't get down here

40:13.780 --> 40:14.780
That's great

40:14.780 --> 40:15.780
And do you run Linux

40:15.780 --> 40:16.780
At home now too

40:16.780 --> 40:17.780
Or are you running

40:17.780 --> 40:19.780
Something else at home?

40:19.780 --> 40:21.780
I used to have my one computer

40:21.780 --> 40:22.780
Triple booted

40:22.780 --> 40:25.780
But yeah

40:25.780 --> 40:26.780
I got a new drive

40:26.780 --> 40:27.780
And it's just running

40:27.780 --> 40:31.780
Mac OS X E70 right now

40:31.780 --> 40:32.780
I caught you

40:32.780 --> 40:33.780
I caught you

40:33.780 --> 40:34.780
It's okay

40:34.780 --> 40:35.780
We still love you Taylor

40:35.780 --> 40:36.780
Oh no

40:36.780 --> 40:37.780
We won't hold it against you

40:37.780 --> 40:38.780
It's okay

40:38.780 --> 40:39.780
So Taylor

40:39.780 --> 40:40.780
When you go out there

40:40.780 --> 40:41.780
Do you have like

40:41.780 --> 40:42.780
Do you get assigned a ticket

40:42.780 --> 40:43.780
And this is Taylor's ticket

40:43.780 --> 40:44.780
And you have to resolve it

40:44.780 --> 40:45.780
And is that tied

40:45.780 --> 40:48.780
In any kind of curriculum?

40:48.780 --> 40:50.780
Well it's tied into the course

40:50.780 --> 40:52.780
It's an honors weighted course

40:52.780 --> 40:55.780
And the whole ticket system deal

40:55.780 --> 40:58.780
Is basically everybody

40:58.780 --> 41:00.780
That has admin privileges

41:00.780 --> 41:02.780
To view the tickets

41:02.780 --> 41:03.780
That are open

41:03.780 --> 41:05.780
They can assign it to themselves

41:05.780 --> 41:07.780
Or transfer it to somebody else

41:07.780 --> 41:11.780
And you just basically answer

41:11.780 --> 41:13.780
If you assign it to yourself

41:13.780 --> 41:15.780
Or you transfer it to somebody else

41:15.780 --> 41:18.780
If you can't necessarily

41:18.780 --> 41:19.780
Figure it out on your own

41:19.780 --> 41:20.780
Okay that sounds pretty reasonable

41:20.780 --> 41:22.780
Sounds like a pretty good system

41:22.780 --> 41:23.780
Is there ever a time

41:23.780 --> 41:24.780
Where you're troubleshooting

41:24.780 --> 41:25.780
Some of this stuff

41:25.780 --> 41:26.780
And this is Taylor

41:26.780 --> 41:27.780
Or anybody that wants to answer this

41:27.780 --> 41:28.780
Is there ever a time

41:28.780 --> 41:29.780
When you're troubleshooting

41:29.780 --> 41:30.780
This kind of stuff

41:30.780 --> 41:31.780
And you think gosh

41:31.780 --> 41:32.780
If it wasn't Linux

41:32.780 --> 41:33.780
This would be a lot easier

41:33.780 --> 41:34.780
Or do you find it sometimes

41:34.780 --> 41:35.780
Is easier to do some troubleshooting

41:35.780 --> 41:36.780
Because it is Linux

41:36.780 --> 41:41.780
Both are things that do come up

41:41.780 --> 41:43.780
With the wall that you hit

41:43.780 --> 41:45.780
When you're trying to find

41:45.780 --> 41:47.780
Something that would be

41:47.780 --> 41:48.780
Maybe easier

41:48.780 --> 41:51.780
There's always alternatives

41:51.780 --> 41:53.780
Stuff like that

41:53.780 --> 41:55.780
Play on Linux to run

41:55.780 --> 41:57.780
Windows applications

41:57.780 --> 41:58.780
If we need to

41:58.780 --> 41:59.780
Stuff like that

41:59.780 --> 42:00.780
That's pretty cool

42:00.780 --> 42:01.780
So you're getting into

42:01.780 --> 42:02.780
Some of the wine stuff too

42:02.780 --> 42:04.780
And how has that worked for you?

42:04.780 --> 42:07.780
The students seem to be

42:07.780 --> 42:08.780
Pretty pleased with it

42:08.780 --> 42:11.780
And it basically gets us around

42:11.780 --> 42:12.780
Obstacles that

42:12.780 --> 42:15.780
They want to use a certain program

42:15.780 --> 42:17.780
And it's only supported

42:17.780 --> 42:18.780
On Windows and Mac

42:18.780 --> 42:20.780
They download the Windows version

42:20.780 --> 42:22.780
And then they just open it up in there

42:22.780 --> 42:23.780
And it does the rest for them

42:23.780 --> 42:25.780
Yeah, that is kind of a nice thing

42:25.780 --> 42:27.780
And I wonder if

42:27.780 --> 42:29.780
And anybody's free to answer this too

42:29.780 --> 42:32.780
How do you guys manage user logins?

42:32.780 --> 42:33.780
Because one of the nice things

42:33.780 --> 42:35.780
About a Windows mobile lab

42:35.780 --> 42:37.780
Or a Windows lab of computers

42:37.780 --> 42:38.780
On the desk

42:38.780 --> 42:39.780
Or whatever it might be

42:39.780 --> 42:40.780
Is it's Windows

42:40.780 --> 42:42.780
But you can tie it into a domain

42:42.780 --> 42:44.780
And it's easy to have one account

42:44.780 --> 42:45.780
Across all the computers

42:45.780 --> 42:49.780
And so is there a standard student login?

42:49.780 --> 42:50.780
Or how are you managing

42:50.780 --> 42:51.780
All of those user accounts

42:51.780 --> 42:53.780
On all of these laptops?

42:53.780 --> 42:55.780
Yeah, actually I'm going to turn that over

42:55.780 --> 42:56.780
To one of my staff

42:56.780 --> 42:57.780
To jump in for a moment

42:57.780 --> 42:58.780
I'll let him introduce himself

42:58.780 --> 43:00.780
And take that question

43:00.780 --> 43:01.780
My name is Chad

43:01.780 --> 43:02.780
Hey Chad

43:02.780 --> 43:05.780
So on the actual laptops themselves

43:05.780 --> 43:07.780
Well as part of the rollout

43:07.780 --> 43:08.780
Every student kind of just

43:08.780 --> 43:09.780
Resets the local password

43:09.780 --> 43:10.780
On the user

43:10.780 --> 43:11.780
And then we actually

43:11.780 --> 43:14.780
Don't even know what they are

43:14.780 --> 43:15.780
And then as far as like

43:15.780 --> 43:17.780
Any services that we provide

43:17.780 --> 43:18.780
As a district

43:18.780 --> 43:19.780
We actually have

43:19.780 --> 43:20.780
Active directory accounts for people

43:20.780 --> 43:22.780
So we do centrally manage those

43:22.780 --> 43:23.780
But that doesn't give them access

43:23.780 --> 43:24.780
To the laptop

43:24.780 --> 43:25.780
It's a separate username and password

43:25.780 --> 43:26.780
Sure, that makes sense

43:26.780 --> 43:27.780
And I suppose as long as

43:27.780 --> 43:28.780
You have root access

43:28.780 --> 43:29.780
You could always get in there

43:29.780 --> 43:30.780
And flip their password

43:30.780 --> 43:31.780
To something you need

43:31.780 --> 43:32.780
If you need to log in as them

43:32.780 --> 43:34.780
Have you ever walked up to a laptop

43:34.780 --> 43:35.780
And been shocked or surprised

43:35.780 --> 43:37.780
By something installed

43:37.780 --> 43:39.780
That maybe came from a repo

43:39.780 --> 43:40.780
That you didn't expect

43:40.780 --> 43:41.780
Like they didn't have to go out

43:41.780 --> 43:42.780
And find it on the web

43:42.780 --> 43:43.780
They just

43:43.780 --> 43:44.780
Somebody came down

43:44.780 --> 43:45.780
They knew Linux

43:45.780 --> 43:46.780
And they installed stuff

43:46.780 --> 43:47.780
Or is this

43:47.780 --> 43:48.780
Is this so different

43:48.780 --> 43:49.780
Than what people are used to

43:49.780 --> 43:50.780
That that almost never happens

43:50.780 --> 43:51.780
I'm looking to the student team

43:51.780 --> 43:52.780
To answer that

43:52.780 --> 43:55.780
So I think you get two different

43:55.780 --> 43:56.780
Two different answers

43:56.780 --> 43:57.780
From the staff and the students

43:57.780 --> 43:58.780
So Taylor

43:58.780 --> 43:59.780
Do you want to take that

43:59.780 --> 44:00.780
Or Nick or somebody

44:00.780 --> 44:01.780
Okay Taylor

44:01.780 --> 44:02.780
Taylor is going to jump in

44:02.780 --> 44:03.780
So were you ever surprised

44:03.780 --> 44:04.780
By anything you saw installed

44:04.780 --> 44:06.780
Well just aesthetic wise

44:06.780 --> 44:08.780
I've seen some freaky wallpapers

44:08.780 --> 44:09.780
For one

44:09.780 --> 44:10.780
Yeah

44:10.780 --> 44:14.780
And I've seen one or two students

44:14.780 --> 44:15.780
That like

44:15.780 --> 44:16.780
Have actually tried to

44:16.780 --> 44:19.780
Like reinstall Ubuntu

44:19.780 --> 44:21.780
Or actually try and install

44:21.780 --> 44:22.780
Windows itself

44:22.780 --> 44:25.780
And they just completely

44:25.780 --> 44:26.780
Messed up everything

44:26.780 --> 44:27.780
Because of it

44:27.780 --> 44:29.780
Yeah that doesn't surprise me

44:29.780 --> 44:30.780
You know I could see them

44:30.780 --> 44:31.780
Like well I'll take this home

44:31.780 --> 44:32.780
And I'll put Windows on

44:32.780 --> 44:33.780
So I can play my games

44:33.780 --> 44:34.780
Or something like that

44:34.780 --> 44:35.780
And then they mess it all up

44:35.780 --> 44:36.780
Yeah okay that makes sense

44:36.780 --> 44:37.780
Okay

44:37.780 --> 44:38.780
I know you

44:38.780 --> 44:39.780
I should

44:39.780 --> 44:40.780
Chris I should add

44:40.780 --> 44:41.780
Just really quickly again

44:41.780 --> 44:42.780
We absolutely encourage

44:42.780 --> 44:43.780
Our students to explore

44:43.780 --> 44:45.780
And tinker with the machines

44:45.780 --> 44:47.780
There is an acceptable

44:47.780 --> 44:48.780
Use policy

44:48.780 --> 44:50.780
There is a mobile policy

44:50.780 --> 44:52.780
That our students do sign

44:52.780 --> 44:54.780
The one thing that we ask

44:54.780 --> 44:55.780
Them not to do

44:55.780 --> 44:56.780
Is to reformat

44:56.780 --> 44:58.780
And reimage the machine

44:58.780 --> 44:59.780
That's one of the boundaries

44:59.780 --> 45:00.780
That we put up

45:00.780 --> 45:01.780
And there's various reasons

45:01.780 --> 45:02.780
For that

45:02.780 --> 45:03.780
You know we have software

45:03.780 --> 45:04.780
That's installed

45:04.780 --> 45:05.780
And there are some

45:05.780 --> 45:06.780
Unique mechanisms

45:06.780 --> 45:07.780
Here at the high school

45:07.780 --> 45:08.780
There's other unique items

45:08.780 --> 45:09.780
That are specific

45:09.780 --> 45:10.780
To the high school

45:10.780 --> 45:11.780
That we need to

45:11.780 --> 45:12.780
Make sure are maintained

45:12.780 --> 45:13.780
On the boxes

45:13.780 --> 45:14.780
So we do put

45:14.780 --> 45:15.780
That barrier up

45:15.780 --> 45:16.780
And that's really more

45:16.780 --> 45:17.780
Of a functional barrier

45:17.780 --> 45:18.780
Because we do have

45:18.780 --> 45:19.780
Certain expectations

45:19.780 --> 45:20.780
Of what's on

45:20.780 --> 45:21.780
The machine itself

45:21.780 --> 45:22.780
You know also our

45:22.780 --> 45:23.780
Filtering software

45:23.780 --> 45:24.780
For example

45:24.780 --> 45:25.780
You know in a perfect world

45:25.780 --> 45:26.780
We would remove

45:26.780 --> 45:27.780
Those restrictions

45:27.780 --> 45:28.780
But there's still the

45:28.780 --> 45:29.780
You know the quote unquote

45:29.780 --> 45:30.780
Business of education

45:30.780 --> 45:31.780
That we have to get done

45:31.780 --> 45:32.780
Inside the school

45:32.780 --> 45:33.780
Sure that makes sense

45:33.780 --> 45:34.780
That's available

45:34.780 --> 45:35.780
For learning

45:35.780 --> 45:36.780
I'm curious

45:36.780 --> 45:37.780
I'm picturing

45:37.780 --> 45:38.780
My environment

45:38.780 --> 45:39.780
Right I'm picturing

45:39.780 --> 45:40.780
A setup like this

45:40.780 --> 45:42.780
Who drives forward

45:42.780 --> 45:43.780
It's who comes

45:43.780 --> 45:44.780
Who pulls everybody together

45:44.780 --> 45:46.780
And says alright

45:46.780 --> 45:47.780
It's been a few years

45:47.780 --> 45:48.780
We deployed

45:48.780 --> 45:49.780
Zubuntu

45:49.780 --> 45:50.780
Or whatever

45:50.780 --> 45:51.780
12.04

45:51.780 --> 45:52.780
14.04

45:52.780 --> 45:53.780
Whatever it is

45:53.780 --> 45:54.780
Who's the person

45:54.780 --> 45:55.780
That now leads

45:55.780 --> 45:56.780
The initiative to say

45:56.780 --> 45:57.780
We've got to update

45:57.780 --> 45:58.780
The Linux deployment tool kit

45:58.780 --> 45:59.780
And we've got to get

45:59.780 --> 46:00.780
The next version

46:00.780 --> 46:01.780
Of all of the applications

46:01.780 --> 46:02.780
And the next version

46:02.780 --> 46:03.780
Of the operating system

46:03.780 --> 46:04.780
On all of these laptops

46:04.780 --> 46:06.780
Who has that initiative

46:06.780 --> 46:07.780
Is that something

46:07.780 --> 46:08.780
That's driven from IT

46:08.780 --> 46:09.780
Is that something that comes

46:09.780 --> 46:10.780
From the student body

46:10.780 --> 46:11.780
That says look

46:11.780 --> 46:12.780
We need these things

46:12.780 --> 46:13.780
How does that work

46:13.780 --> 46:14.780
In this setup

46:14.780 --> 46:15.780
Yeah in our case

46:15.780 --> 46:16.780
That's driven by IT

46:16.780 --> 46:17.780
You know we look at

46:17.780 --> 46:18.780
We'd like to stay on

46:18.780 --> 46:19.780
Long term support releases

46:19.780 --> 46:20.780
You know I mentioned

46:20.780 --> 46:21.780
In the past

46:21.780 --> 46:22.780
We actually started

46:22.780 --> 46:23.780
The elementary level

46:23.780 --> 46:24.780
With Zubuntu

46:24.780 --> 46:25.780
On 12.04

46:25.780 --> 46:26.780
Our current implementation

46:26.780 --> 46:27.780
Here at the high school

46:27.780 --> 46:31.780
Is pretty close to stock

46:31.780 --> 46:32.780
Ubuntu 14.04

46:32.780 --> 46:33.780
Long term support

46:33.780 --> 46:36.780
We actually do use Unity

46:36.780 --> 46:37.780
But yeah at some point

46:37.780 --> 46:38.780
We'll look at that

46:38.780 --> 46:39.780
You know my team

46:39.780 --> 46:40.780
And I will sit down

46:40.780 --> 46:41.780
And decide well

46:41.780 --> 46:42.780
It's time to you know

46:42.780 --> 46:43.780
To rev and move up

46:43.780 --> 46:44.780
To the latest long term

46:44.780 --> 46:45.780
Support release

46:45.780 --> 46:46.780
We're pretty happy

46:46.780 --> 46:47.780
With 14.04 right now

46:47.780 --> 46:48.780
We're not seeing

46:48.780 --> 46:49.780
Any roadblocks

46:49.780 --> 46:50.780
But you know likely

46:50.780 --> 46:51.780
When the next long term

46:51.780 --> 46:52.780
Support comes out

46:52.780 --> 46:53.780
We'll look at that again

46:53.780 --> 46:54.780
And build a fresh image

46:54.780 --> 46:55.780
Now of course

46:55.780 --> 46:56.780
In the intermediate time

46:56.780 --> 46:57.780
As there's applications

46:57.780 --> 46:58.780
That we need

46:58.780 --> 46:59.780
We'll rev those

46:59.780 --> 47:00.780
As need be

47:00.780 --> 47:01.780
We pulled back

47:01.780 --> 47:02.780
All of the one to one

47:02.780 --> 47:03.780
Machines this past summer

47:03.780 --> 47:04.780
And re-imaged them

47:04.780 --> 47:05.780
Up to 14.04

47:05.780 --> 47:06.780
Long term support

47:06.780 --> 47:07.780
But again it's really

47:07.780 --> 47:08.780
Driven by you know

47:08.780 --> 47:09.780
The OS reps

47:09.780 --> 47:10.780
You mentioned

47:10.780 --> 47:11.780
You're running Unity

47:11.780 --> 47:12.780
What's the reaction

47:12.780 --> 47:13.780
Been to Unity

47:13.780 --> 47:14.780
From this

47:14.780 --> 47:15.780
From the student body

47:15.780 --> 47:16.780
I think I'm going to

47:16.780 --> 47:17.780
Let the students

47:17.780 --> 47:18.780
Answer that

47:18.780 --> 47:19.780
We have two

47:19.780 --> 47:20.780
Just to give you a sense

47:20.780 --> 47:21.780
Of who's with us today

47:21.780 --> 47:23.780
We have two of our current

47:23.780 --> 47:24.780
Help desk students

47:24.780 --> 47:25.780
Two current students

47:25.780 --> 47:26.780
Here at Penn Manor

47:26.780 --> 47:27.780
And I also have

47:27.780 --> 47:29.780
Three of our Vanguard

47:29.780 --> 47:30.780
Help desk students

47:30.780 --> 47:31.780
These are three individuals

47:31.780 --> 47:32.780
That have

47:32.780 --> 47:33.780
That actually just

47:33.780 --> 47:34.780
Graduated last year

47:34.780 --> 47:35.780
So they're here as well

47:35.780 --> 47:36.780
But I think for the reaction

47:36.780 --> 47:37.780
To the Unity interface

47:37.780 --> 47:38.780
Nick would you like

47:38.780 --> 47:39.780
To take that

47:39.780 --> 47:40.780
Sure

47:40.780 --> 47:41.780
You want to jump in

47:41.780 --> 47:42.780
And take

47:42.780 --> 47:43.780
Hi I'm Nick

47:43.780 --> 47:44.780
And a lot of the students

47:44.780 --> 47:45.780
Here actually kind of

47:45.780 --> 47:46.780
Do like the laptops

47:46.780 --> 47:47.780
But some are complaining

47:47.780 --> 47:48.780
Because they are

47:48.780 --> 47:49.780
So used to Windows

47:49.780 --> 47:50.780
Or Mac

47:50.780 --> 47:51.780
And they can't play

47:51.780 --> 47:52.780
Their games on here

47:52.780 --> 47:53.780
So they keep coming down

47:53.780 --> 47:54.780
But it's something that

47:54.780 --> 47:55.780
We can actually

47:55.780 --> 47:56.780
Really do without

47:56.780 --> 47:57.780
Installing a GUI

47:57.780 --> 47:58.780
Or a different sub

47:58.780 --> 47:59.780
That they can use

47:59.780 --> 48:00.780
But overall

48:00.780 --> 48:01.780
A lot of students

48:01.780 --> 48:02.780
Do like them

48:02.780 --> 48:03.780
Because it gives them

48:03.780 --> 48:04.780
The opportunity to

48:04.780 --> 48:05.780
Bring the laptop home

48:05.780 --> 48:06.780
Work on stuff for school

48:06.780 --> 48:07.780
And then bring it back

48:07.780 --> 48:08.780
Without having to be back

48:08.780 --> 48:09.780
A couple of days or weeks

48:09.780 --> 48:10.780
That makes a lot of sense

48:10.780 --> 48:11.780
So Charlie I know you have

48:11.780 --> 48:12.780
Sounds like you have

48:12.780 --> 48:13.780
A good range of experience

48:13.780 --> 48:14.780
There

48:14.780 --> 48:15.780
Here's my question

48:15.780 --> 48:16.780
You know

48:16.780 --> 48:17.780
Here you are

48:17.780 --> 48:18.780
A very large

48:18.780 --> 48:19.780
What I find fascinating

48:19.780 --> 48:20.780
About this is

48:20.780 --> 48:21.780
It's a very large

48:21.780 --> 48:22.780
Concentrated Linux deployment

48:22.780 --> 48:23.780
Of similar hardware

48:23.780 --> 48:24.780
With a specific

48:24.780 --> 48:25.780
Use case in mind

48:25.780 --> 48:26.780
And I'm curious

48:26.780 --> 48:27.780
And maybe people might

48:27.780 --> 48:28.780
Ask what is Linux lacking

48:28.780 --> 48:29.780
That would make

48:29.780 --> 48:30.780
Your job easier

48:30.780 --> 48:31.780
What have you gone

48:31.780 --> 48:32.780
Oh man

48:32.780 --> 48:33.780
If we just had this

48:33.780 --> 48:34.780
Or if we could just do this

48:34.780 --> 48:35.780
XYZ would be easier

48:35.780 --> 48:36.780
Or we could get this

48:36.780 --> 48:37.780
Better accomplished

48:37.780 --> 48:38.780
What's been lacking

48:38.780 --> 48:39.780
For this initiative

48:39.780 --> 48:40.780
That you've maybe

48:40.780 --> 48:41.780
Worked around

48:41.780 --> 48:42.780
It's not insolvable

48:42.780 --> 48:43.780
But it's maybe

48:43.780 --> 48:44.780
Not the best case

48:44.780 --> 48:45.780
Yeah I think

48:45.780 --> 48:46.780
Four of us kind of

48:46.780 --> 48:47.780
Jumped up and thought

48:47.780 --> 48:48.780
The same thing together

48:48.780 --> 48:49.780
I'm going to introduce you

48:49.780 --> 48:50.780
To another member

48:50.780 --> 48:51.780
Of my staff

48:51.780 --> 48:52.780
Take it away Alex

48:52.780 --> 48:53.780
Hi my name is Alex

48:53.780 --> 48:54.780
I will say

48:54.780 --> 48:55.780
Two things that

48:55.780 --> 48:56.780
Could be improved

48:56.780 --> 48:57.780
From the feedback

48:57.780 --> 48:58.780
From the students

48:58.780 --> 48:59.780
First is that

48:59.780 --> 49:00.780
Since the students

49:00.780 --> 49:01.780
Get to take

49:01.780 --> 49:02.780
The computers home

49:02.780 --> 49:03.780
They already have

49:03.780 --> 49:04.780
Equipment at home

49:04.780 --> 49:05.780
Printers especially

49:05.780 --> 49:06.780
Different network setups

49:06.780 --> 49:07.780
And it's the lack of

49:07.780 --> 49:08.780
Drivers for many

49:08.780 --> 49:09.780
Devices they run at home

49:09.780 --> 49:10.780
Sometimes they have to

49:10.780 --> 49:11.780
Come to us

49:11.780 --> 49:12.780
And help them

49:12.780 --> 49:13.780
To install the drivers

49:13.780 --> 49:14.780
That they can

49:14.780 --> 49:15.780
Do themselves

49:15.780 --> 49:16.780
The second one

49:16.780 --> 49:17.780
Is there's a lack

49:17.780 --> 49:26.780
Of polish on the GUI

49:26.780 --> 49:30.780
For most of the programs

49:30.780 --> 49:31.780
And that from students

49:31.780 --> 49:32.780
That are used to

49:32.780 --> 49:33.780
Carrying their

49:33.780 --> 49:34.780
Android phones

49:34.780 --> 49:35.780
Or iPhones

49:35.780 --> 49:36.780
The interface

49:36.780 --> 49:37.780
Sells a lot

49:37.780 --> 49:38.780
That's a really good point

49:38.780 --> 49:39.780
Yeah they see it

49:39.780 --> 49:40.780
As a polish thing

49:40.780 --> 49:49.780
That's a good point

49:49.780 --> 49:50.780
And the drivers

49:50.780 --> 49:51.780
I could see

49:51.780 --> 49:52.780
Being an issue

49:52.780 --> 49:53.780
Actually if you don't mind

49:53.780 --> 49:54.780
Chris

49:54.780 --> 49:55.780
If you don't mind

49:55.780 --> 49:56.780
I was looking at

49:56.780 --> 49:57.780
Some of the other students

49:57.780 --> 49:58.780
Again current

49:58.780 --> 50:00.780
And past students

50:00.780 --> 50:01.780
Does anybody else

50:01.780 --> 50:02.780
Want to add to that

50:02.780 --> 50:03.780
What are their

50:03.780 --> 50:04.780
Impediments of

50:04.780 --> 50:05.780
People are shaking their heads

50:05.780 --> 50:06.780
Any other ideas

50:06.780 --> 50:07.780
The fact that we can't

50:07.780 --> 50:08.780
Actually print from these

50:08.780 --> 50:09.780
Because we can't

50:09.780 --> 50:10.780
Drive our support

50:10.780 --> 50:11.780
For printing

50:11.780 --> 50:12.780
Yeah that's another

50:12.780 --> 50:13.780
Road block

50:13.780 --> 50:14.780
That we bump into

50:14.780 --> 50:15.780
Although that's not terrible

50:15.780 --> 50:16.780
I mean it's gotten better

50:16.780 --> 50:17.780
Over the years I think

50:17.780 --> 50:18.780
But it's still problematic

50:18.780 --> 50:19.780
I think you know

50:19.780 --> 50:20.780
To add to that

50:20.780 --> 50:21.780
You know we hear a lot

50:21.780 --> 50:22.780
From students and parents

50:22.780 --> 50:23.780
You know that

50:23.780 --> 50:24.780
That just are very unfamiliar

50:24.780 --> 50:25.780
With Linux

50:25.780 --> 50:26.780
And they run into

50:26.780 --> 50:27.780
Road blocks

50:27.780 --> 50:28.780
When they're trying to

50:28.780 --> 50:29.780
Install their home printers

50:29.780 --> 50:30.780
And other devices

50:30.780 --> 50:31.780
So that's pretty common

50:31.780 --> 50:32.780
And have you

50:32.780 --> 50:33.780
Guys experimented all

50:33.780 --> 50:34.780
With something like

50:34.780 --> 50:35.780
Google Cloud Print

50:35.780 --> 50:36.780
Or something like that

50:36.780 --> 50:37.780
That sort of normalizes

50:37.780 --> 50:38.780
The print driver

50:38.780 --> 50:39.780
Where print rendering

50:39.780 --> 50:40.780
Is done on a separate box

50:40.780 --> 50:41.780
Because I mean that's

50:41.780 --> 50:42.780
A lot of times

50:42.780 --> 50:43.780
How network printing works

50:43.780 --> 50:44.780
But Google Cloud Print

50:44.780 --> 50:45.780
I know you're not big

50:45.780 --> 50:46.780
On a lot of the Google services

50:46.780 --> 50:47.780
But Google Cloud Print

50:47.780 --> 50:48.780
Might resolve the issue

50:48.780 --> 50:49.780
For home users

50:49.780 --> 50:50.780
Yeah we haven't really

50:50.780 --> 50:51.780
Explored that

50:51.780 --> 50:52.780
But it's not out of the question

50:52.780 --> 50:53.780
I mean it always could be

50:53.780 --> 50:54.780
Something we look at

50:54.780 --> 50:55.780
Down the road

50:55.780 --> 50:56.780
My team is all kind of

50:56.780 --> 50:57.780
Collectively nodding heads

50:57.780 --> 50:58.780
Up and down

50:58.780 --> 50:59.780
Yeah

50:59.780 --> 51:00.780
I wonder

51:00.780 --> 51:01.780
Have you seen

51:01.780 --> 51:02.780
Or heard of students

51:02.780 --> 51:03.780
Maybe not a lot

51:03.780 --> 51:04.780
But have you heard

51:04.780 --> 51:05.780
Of some students

51:05.780 --> 51:06.780
That were sort of encouraged

51:06.780 --> 51:07.780
Maybe motivated

51:07.780 --> 51:08.780
To use Linux

51:08.780 --> 51:09.780
On their home computer

51:09.780 --> 51:10.780
Yeah actually Nick

51:10.780 --> 51:11.780
Go ahead

51:11.780 --> 51:12.780
Jump in

51:12.780 --> 51:13.780
Last year actually

51:13.780 --> 51:14.780
When I decided to

51:14.780 --> 51:15.780
Join this

51:15.780 --> 51:16.780
My Windows 7 laptop

51:16.780 --> 51:17.780
Was being corrupted

51:17.780 --> 51:18.780
And it wasn't working

51:18.780 --> 51:19.780
So I decided to actually

51:19.780 --> 51:20.780
Install Linux on here

51:20.780 --> 51:21.780
And actually worked out

51:21.780 --> 51:22.780
For the better

51:22.780 --> 51:23.780
I kind of actually prefer

51:23.780 --> 51:24.780
That over Windows 7

51:24.780 --> 51:25.780
Right now

51:25.780 --> 51:26.780
Because it seems to be

51:26.780 --> 51:27.780
Very unstable

51:27.780 --> 51:28.780
That's awesome

51:28.780 --> 51:29.780
Windows 7 was unstable

51:29.780 --> 51:30.780
Yeah

51:30.780 --> 51:31.780
Right yeah

51:31.780 --> 51:32.780
Yeah

51:32.780 --> 51:33.780
Well that's

51:33.780 --> 51:34.780
That's great

51:34.780 --> 51:35.780
And so

51:35.780 --> 51:36.780
I want to

51:36.780 --> 51:37.780
We're going to

51:37.780 --> 51:38.780
We're going to keep

51:38.780 --> 51:39.780
Pulling ahead here

51:39.780 --> 51:40.780
On some of

51:40.780 --> 51:41.780
The rest of the show

51:41.780 --> 51:42.780
But you guys

51:42.780 --> 51:43.780
Feel free to jump in

51:43.780 --> 51:44.780
On any insights you have

51:44.780 --> 51:45.780
On any of the

51:45.780 --> 51:46.780
Rest of the topics

51:46.780 --> 51:47.780
For today

51:47.780 --> 51:48.780
I guess

51:48.780 --> 51:49.780
My final question is

51:49.780 --> 51:50.780
What's next

51:50.780 --> 51:51.780
Charlie you mentioned

51:51.780 --> 51:52.780
Getting down the rest

51:52.780 --> 51:53.780
Of the school district

51:53.780 --> 51:54.780
What kind of initiatives

51:54.780 --> 51:55.780
Are next for this

51:55.780 --> 51:56.780
Kind of huge project

51:56.780 --> 51:58.780
Yeah I think in our

51:58.780 --> 51:59.780
In our immediate future

51:59.780 --> 52:00.780
We're having discussions

52:00.780 --> 52:01.780
About expanding our

52:01.780 --> 52:02.780
One to one program

52:02.780 --> 52:03.780
To the middle levels

52:03.780 --> 52:04.780
Currently

52:04.780 --> 52:05.780
The only students

52:05.780 --> 52:06.780
That are carrying laptops

52:06.780 --> 52:07.780
As part of the one to one

52:07.780 --> 52:08.780
Are in high school

52:08.780 --> 52:09.780
That's grades 9 through 12

52:09.780 --> 52:10.780
So we're beginning

52:10.780 --> 52:11.780
These planning stages

52:11.780 --> 52:12.780
For rolling that out

52:12.780 --> 52:13.780
To grades 7 and 8

52:13.780 --> 52:14.780
For next year

52:14.780 --> 52:15.780
You know I think

52:15.780 --> 52:16.780
You know beyond that

52:16.780 --> 52:17.780
You know I'm beginning

52:17.780 --> 52:18.780
To think longer range

52:18.780 --> 52:19.780
You know what does this

52:19.780 --> 52:20.780
Look like for an elementary

52:20.780 --> 52:21.780
Implementation

52:21.780 --> 52:22.780
You know but that's

52:22.780 --> 52:23.780
Just the operational

52:23.780 --> 52:24.780
Side of the house

52:24.780 --> 52:25.780
I think that you know

52:25.780 --> 52:26.780
Ideally

52:26.780 --> 52:27.780
What I look forward to

52:27.780 --> 52:28.780
Is just watching

52:28.780 --> 52:29.780
Our teachers and our students

52:29.780 --> 52:30.780
And the interesting

52:30.780 --> 52:31.780
Creative uses

52:31.780 --> 52:32.780
That they have

52:32.780 --> 52:33.780
For the laptops

52:33.780 --> 52:34.780
I mean the whole reason

52:34.780 --> 52:35.780
Is because

52:35.780 --> 52:36.780
It's a learning initiative

52:36.780 --> 52:37.780
You know again

52:37.780 --> 52:38.780
We talk a lot about it

52:38.780 --> 52:39.780
From the technical perspective

52:39.780 --> 52:40.780
And it's very interesting

52:40.780 --> 52:41.780
And you know

52:41.780 --> 52:42.780
And exciting

52:42.780 --> 52:43.780
But at the same time

52:43.780 --> 52:44.780
I think the learning

52:44.780 --> 52:45.780
Opportunities for our kids

52:45.780 --> 52:46.780
I mean that's really

52:46.780 --> 52:47.780
What gets me excited

52:47.780 --> 52:48.780
And I just can't wait

52:48.780 --> 52:49.780
To see what neat things

52:49.780 --> 52:50.780
Our students begin producing

52:50.780 --> 52:51.780
And finding and discovering

52:51.780 --> 52:52.780
You know everything

52:52.780 --> 52:53.780
From coding

52:53.780 --> 52:54.780
To painting and drawing

52:54.780 --> 52:55.780
Applications

52:55.780 --> 52:56.780
To what they do

52:56.780 --> 52:57.780
With the 3D programs

52:57.780 --> 52:58.780
You know I'm just

52:58.780 --> 52:59.780
Really looking forward

52:59.780 --> 53:00.780
To what our kids do

53:00.780 --> 53:01.780
And what they can produce

53:01.780 --> 53:02.780
And build

53:02.780 --> 53:03.780
And you know projects

53:03.780 --> 53:04.780
Yeah absolutely

53:04.780 --> 53:05.780
And I think it's

53:05.780 --> 53:06.780
There's also maybe

53:06.780 --> 53:07.780
Some long term advantages

53:07.780 --> 53:08.780
On being on

53:08.780 --> 53:09.780
The Linux ecosystem

53:09.780 --> 53:10.780
Being on

53:10.780 --> 53:11.780
Getting familiar

53:11.780 --> 53:12.780
With these interfaces

53:12.780 --> 53:13.780
These program names

53:13.780 --> 53:14.780
How they work

53:14.780 --> 53:15.780
It seems like

53:15.780 --> 53:16.780
We are rapidly approaching

53:16.780 --> 53:17.780
A time where

53:17.780 --> 53:18.780
The Raspberry Pi

53:18.780 --> 53:19.780
And devices like it

53:19.780 --> 53:20.780
Could become

53:20.780 --> 53:21.780
Consumerized, productized

53:21.780 --> 53:22.780
And be very accessible

53:22.780 --> 53:26.780
To low cost deployments

53:26.780 --> 53:27.780
Like a school deployment

53:27.780 --> 53:28.780
And the best part about that

53:28.780 --> 53:30.780
In the case of the Raspberry Pi

53:30.780 --> 53:31.780
Is it's fundamentally

53:31.780 --> 53:32.780
Different hardware

53:32.780 --> 53:33.780
Than your desktop PC

53:33.780 --> 53:34.780
But you can still run

53:34.780 --> 53:35.780
The same Unity desktop

53:35.780 --> 53:36.780
The same you know

53:36.780 --> 53:37.780
Firefox applications

53:37.780 --> 53:38.780
And LibreOffice

53:38.780 --> 53:39.780
And all of this stuff

53:39.780 --> 53:40.780
And the school

53:40.780 --> 53:41.780
Would in theory

53:41.780 --> 53:42.780
When these devices

53:42.780 --> 53:43.780
Are powerful enough

53:43.780 --> 53:44.780
If they're not already

53:44.780 --> 53:45.780
Would be able to jump in

53:45.780 --> 53:46.780
And start deploying those

53:46.780 --> 53:47.780
And the cost savings

53:47.780 --> 53:48.780
Like it just seems like

53:48.780 --> 53:49.780
It will continue

53:49.780 --> 53:50.780
To pay off over time

53:50.780 --> 53:51.780
But I guess here's

53:51.780 --> 53:52.780
My really last question

53:52.780 --> 53:53.780
For you Charlie is

53:53.780 --> 53:54.780
You know down the road

53:54.780 --> 53:55.780
You win the lottery

53:55.780 --> 53:56.780
Or a lot of folks

53:56.780 --> 53:57.780
On the IT staff

53:57.780 --> 53:58.780
Win the lottery

53:58.780 --> 53:59.780
Change over happens

53:59.780 --> 54:00.780
Maybe 5, 10 years

54:00.780 --> 54:01.780
Does this initiative

54:01.780 --> 54:02.780
Continue on on its own

54:02.780 --> 54:03.780
Does it have enough momentum

54:03.780 --> 54:04.780
Or if the stars

54:04.780 --> 54:05.780
That are pushing it

54:05.780 --> 54:06.780
Sort of fade

54:06.780 --> 54:07.780
Will the initiative

54:07.780 --> 54:08.780
Begin to fade

54:08.780 --> 54:09.780
And that dominant

54:09.780 --> 54:10.780
Narrative from the parents

54:10.780 --> 54:11.780
And perhaps new faculty members

54:11.780 --> 54:12.780
Who come in from

54:12.780 --> 54:13.780
Other school districts

54:13.780 --> 54:14.780
Come and say

54:14.780 --> 54:15.780
Well this isn't Windows

54:15.780 --> 54:16.780
Where is Office

54:16.780 --> 54:17.780
Windows 10 just came out

54:17.780 --> 54:18.780
It's amazing

54:18.780 --> 54:19.780
You know these kinds of

54:19.780 --> 54:20.780
These kinds of

54:20.780 --> 54:21.780
Will always be

54:21.780 --> 54:22.780
Outside external pressures

54:22.780 --> 54:23.780
That are always constantly

54:23.780 --> 54:24.780
When new eyes come in

54:24.780 --> 54:25.780
Reassessing your project

54:25.780 --> 54:26.780
Reassessing what you're

54:26.780 --> 54:27.780
Doing here

54:27.780 --> 54:28.780
Constantly questioning it

54:28.780 --> 54:29.780
And I wonder

54:29.780 --> 54:30.780
Is this something

54:30.780 --> 54:31.780
That can hold up

54:31.780 --> 54:32.780
To scrutiny long term

54:32.780 --> 54:33.780
Say if some of the

54:33.780 --> 54:34.780
Key drivers behind it

54:34.780 --> 54:35.780
Were to go away

54:35.780 --> 54:36.780
Yeah I think

54:36.780 --> 54:37.780
I think it can

54:37.780 --> 54:39.780
And I think a large reason

54:39.780 --> 54:40.780
Or really to that point

54:40.780 --> 54:41.780
We've been building

54:41.780 --> 54:42.780
To this point

54:42.780 --> 54:43.780
This isn't just something

54:43.780 --> 54:44.780
That we woke up one day

54:44.780 --> 54:45.780
And we decided

54:45.780 --> 54:46.780
Hey we're going to roll out

54:46.780 --> 54:47.780
Not only A a one to one

54:47.780 --> 54:48.780
But also B we're going to

54:48.780 --> 54:49.780
Do it on Linux

54:49.780 --> 54:50.780
You know we've been

54:50.780 --> 54:51.780
Building on experiences

54:51.780 --> 54:52.780
And successes

54:52.780 --> 54:54.780
For well over a decade

54:54.780 --> 54:55.780
You know we started

54:55.780 --> 54:56.780
Again with

54:56.780 --> 54:58.780
With a huge deployment

54:58.780 --> 54:59.780
Of well actually

54:59.780 --> 55:00.780
Started small

55:00.780 --> 55:01.780
But built up a huge

55:01.780 --> 55:02.780
You know a huge infrastructure

55:02.780 --> 55:03.780
Based around open source

55:03.780 --> 55:04.780
And Linux

55:04.780 --> 55:05.780
And demonstrated that

55:05.780 --> 55:06.780
It's not only the cost savings

55:06.780 --> 55:07.780
But it can work

55:07.780 --> 55:08.780
And that open source

55:08.780 --> 55:09.780
Works well

55:09.780 --> 55:10.780
In an enterprise environment

55:10.780 --> 55:11.780
In schools

55:11.780 --> 55:12.780
So I think that you know

55:12.780 --> 55:13.780
Culturally it's

55:13.780 --> 55:14.780
It's really been

55:14.780 --> 55:15.780
Threaded into our DNA

55:15.780 --> 55:17.780
And into our philosophy

55:17.780 --> 55:18.780
Here at Penn Manor

55:18.780 --> 55:19.780
At this school

55:19.780 --> 55:20.780
And I really don't see that

55:20.780 --> 55:21.780
Unraveling any time soon

55:21.780 --> 55:22.780
Because we've demonstrated

55:22.780 --> 55:24.780
That it's a fantastic

55:24.780 --> 55:25.780
Learning model

55:25.780 --> 55:26.780
Model for education

55:26.780 --> 55:27.780
And one that saves

55:27.780 --> 55:28.780
A truckload of money

55:28.780 --> 55:29.780
You know now

55:29.780 --> 55:30.780
Who knows down the future

55:30.780 --> 55:31.780
I mean we would be remiss

55:31.780 --> 55:32.780
If we were not constantly

55:32.780 --> 55:34.780
Re-evaluating technology

55:34.780 --> 55:35.780
Both open source

55:35.780 --> 55:37.780
And proprietary

55:37.780 --> 55:38.780
My team and I

55:38.780 --> 55:39.780
Have a fundamental belief

55:39.780 --> 55:40.780
And we

55:40.780 --> 55:41.780
Our fundamental philosophy

55:41.780 --> 55:42.780
Is obviously you know

55:42.780 --> 55:44.780
Turn toward open source

55:44.780 --> 55:45.780
But we continue to evaluate

55:45.780 --> 55:46.780
And see if there are

55:46.780 --> 55:47.780
Better solutions

55:47.780 --> 55:48.780
And at this point

55:48.780 --> 55:49.780
I don't see anything

55:49.780 --> 55:50.780
In the near to long term

55:50.780 --> 55:51.780
Future that is better

55:51.780 --> 55:52.780
Than a full open source

55:52.780 --> 55:53.780
Implementation for us

55:53.780 --> 55:54.780
From an operational

55:54.780 --> 55:55.780
And more importantly

55:55.780 --> 55:56.780
An educational perspective

55:56.780 --> 55:57.780
Right that makes

55:57.780 --> 55:58.780
No sense

55:58.780 --> 55:59.780
I mean it

55:59.780 --> 56:00.780
Fundamentally at the end

56:00.780 --> 56:01.780
Of the day

56:01.780 --> 56:02.780
Is the best tool

56:02.780 --> 56:03.780
For the job

56:03.780 --> 56:04.780
It's not just one thing

56:04.780 --> 56:05.780
There's a lot of

56:05.780 --> 56:06.780
Aspects to it

56:06.780 --> 56:07.780
Well that's

56:07.780 --> 56:08.780
That's great to hear

56:08.780 --> 56:09.780
And Charlie I've heard

56:09.780 --> 56:10.780
From you know

56:10.780 --> 56:11.780
A lot of people think

56:11.780 --> 56:12.780
This is a great initiative

56:12.780 --> 56:13.780
So major compliments

56:13.780 --> 56:15.780
To the whole team over there

56:15.780 --> 56:16.780
All the students

56:16.780 --> 56:17.780
And everybody

56:17.780 --> 56:18.780
It's really awesome

56:18.780 --> 56:19.780
And it's I don't know

56:19.780 --> 56:20.780
To be honest

56:20.780 --> 56:21.780
It's sort of

56:21.780 --> 56:22.780
It's brought back

56:22.780 --> 56:23.780
My optimism about it

56:23.780 --> 56:24.780
Because it's something

56:24.780 --> 56:25.780
I'd seen fade away

56:25.780 --> 56:26.780
So it's really good

56:26.780 --> 56:27.780
It's people motivated

56:27.780 --> 56:28.780
To get into technology

56:28.780 --> 56:30.780
So everyone over there

56:30.780 --> 56:31.780
Please continue to huddle

56:31.780 --> 56:32.780
Around the laptop

56:32.780 --> 56:33.780
And join us for the remainder

56:33.780 --> 56:34.780
Of the show

56:34.780 --> 56:35.780
And feel free to jump in

56:35.780 --> 56:36.780
Just flag us

56:36.780 --> 56:37.780
If you want to say something

56:37.780 --> 56:38.780
Because I'd love to hear

56:38.780 --> 56:39.780
Your insights on any

56:39.780 --> 56:40.780
Of this stuff

56:40.780 --> 56:41.780
So if somebody has something

56:41.780 --> 56:42.780
They want to contribute

56:42.780 --> 56:43.780
Just raise your hand

56:43.780 --> 56:45.780
And I'll have Charlie ping me

56:45.780 --> 56:47.780
So before we get into

56:47.780 --> 56:48.780
Our next topic

56:48.780 --> 56:49.780
Which is I'm really

56:49.780 --> 56:50.780
I think I'm really happy

56:50.780 --> 56:52.780
With the way our chat

56:52.780 --> 56:53.780
With Mark Shalloworth turned out

56:53.780 --> 56:55.780
I recorded it yesterday

56:55.780 --> 56:56.780
On Monday at 10 a.m.

56:56.780 --> 56:57.780
I did it off air

56:57.780 --> 56:58.780
Because I wanted to ask him

56:58.780 --> 56:59.780
A few things that I wanted him

56:59.780 --> 57:00.780
To feel comfortable

57:00.780 --> 57:01.780
Not having a live audience

57:01.780 --> 57:02.780
Answering them

57:02.780 --> 57:03.780
Because I wanted to go

57:03.780 --> 57:04.780
A little bit deeper

57:04.780 --> 57:05.780
Than the typical

57:05.780 --> 57:06.780
Mark Shalloworth interview goes

57:06.780 --> 57:08.780
And I called him out

57:08.780 --> 57:09.780
On a couple of things

57:09.780 --> 57:10.780
That I think are misconceptions

57:10.780 --> 57:11.780
And he did a really good job

57:11.780 --> 57:12.780
Of addressing them

57:12.780 --> 57:13.780
So I really encourage you

57:13.780 --> 57:14.780
To tune into Sundays

57:14.780 --> 57:15.780
The upcoming Linux action show

57:15.780 --> 57:17.780
Because we covered some ground

57:17.780 --> 57:19.780
That I think a lot of interviews

57:19.780 --> 57:20.780
Have danced around

57:20.780 --> 57:21.780
But nobody's asked Mark

57:21.780 --> 57:22.780
Some of the direct questions

57:22.780 --> 57:23.780
The preview I'm going to play

57:23.780 --> 57:25.780
In today's show

57:25.780 --> 57:26.780
Is Mark's thoughts

57:26.780 --> 57:27.780
In light of

57:27.780 --> 57:29.780
The Debian community upsets

57:29.780 --> 57:30.780
So this is very pertinent

57:30.780 --> 57:31.780
To the discussions

57:31.780 --> 57:32.780
We've had on this show

57:32.780 --> 57:33.780
And I think it actually

57:33.780 --> 57:34.780
Would be pertinent

57:34.780 --> 57:35.780
For some of the students

57:35.780 --> 57:36.780
That are listening right now

57:36.780 --> 57:38.780
On how conflict resolution

57:38.780 --> 57:39.780
Has to kind of work

57:39.780 --> 57:40.780
In the open source community

57:40.780 --> 57:42.780
Before we get to that, though

57:42.780 --> 57:43.780
I want to thank our next sponsor

57:43.780 --> 57:44.780
And that's Linux Academy

57:44.780 --> 57:46.780
This is a great opportunity

57:46.780 --> 57:47.780
For you to go

57:47.780 --> 57:48.780
Bring your skill level up

57:48.780 --> 57:49.780
A little bit

57:49.780 --> 57:50.780
And have something

57:50.780 --> 57:51.780
On that resume

57:51.780 --> 57:52.780
You know, we had an email earlier

57:52.780 --> 57:53.780
Asking about something

57:53.780 --> 57:55.780
That Jesse, I believe it was

57:55.780 --> 57:56.780
That wanted to go out

57:56.780 --> 57:57.780
And try to get something

57:57.780 --> 57:58.780
On the resume

57:58.780 --> 57:59.780
Try to put something

57:59.780 --> 58:00.780
On the books to show

58:00.780 --> 58:01.780
That he's been expanding

58:01.780 --> 58:02.780
His skill set

58:02.780 --> 58:03.780
And that the unemployment time

58:03.780 --> 58:04.780
Has been well spent

58:04.780 --> 58:05.780
Well, Linux Academy

58:05.780 --> 58:06.780
Might be a good way to do that

58:06.780 --> 58:07.780
Because if you go to

58:07.780 --> 58:08.780
LinuxAcademy.com

58:08.780 --> 58:09.780
Slash unplugged

58:09.780 --> 58:10.780
If you go over there right now

58:10.780 --> 58:11.780
You'll get our special discount

58:11.780 --> 58:12.780
That's

58:12.780 --> 58:13.780
LinuxAcademy.com

58:13.780 --> 58:14.780
Slash unplugged

58:14.780 --> 58:15.780
You'll save 33%

58:15.780 --> 58:16.780
On the quarter

58:16.780 --> 58:17.780
And it's a really

58:17.780 --> 58:18.780
Amazing service

58:18.780 --> 58:19.780
It's training

58:19.780 --> 58:20.780
For Linux users

58:20.780 --> 58:21.780
By Linux users

58:21.780 --> 58:22.780
And it's everything

58:22.780 --> 58:23.780
Under that umbrella

58:23.780 --> 58:24.780
DevOps

58:24.780 --> 58:25.780
AWS

58:25.780 --> 58:26.780
OpenStack

58:26.780 --> 58:27.780
Virtualization

58:27.780 --> 58:28.780
Basic command line stuff

58:28.780 --> 58:29.780
Grep

58:29.780 --> 58:30.780
R-Sync

58:30.780 --> 58:31.780
It's everything

58:31.780 --> 58:32.780
Under the umbrella

58:32.780 --> 58:33.780
All of it

58:33.780 --> 58:34.780
And it's done by people

58:34.780 --> 58:35.780
Who truly know

58:35.780 --> 58:36.780
The subject matter

58:36.780 --> 58:37.780
They're not generalists

58:37.780 --> 58:38.780
They're experts

58:38.780 --> 58:39.780
They're expert trainers

58:39.780 --> 58:40.780
They're programmers

58:40.780 --> 58:41.780
It's really

58:41.780 --> 58:42.780
Exactly what

58:42.780 --> 58:43.780
The market's been waiting for

58:43.780 --> 58:44.780
And I think that's why

58:44.780 --> 58:45.780
They're seeing so much success

58:45.780 --> 58:46.780
So go to

58:46.780 --> 58:47.780
LinuxAcademy.com

58:47.780 --> 58:48.780
Slash unplugged

58:48.780 --> 58:49.780
To get started

58:49.780 --> 58:50.780
You have

58:50.780 --> 58:51.780
A lot of free guides

58:51.780 --> 58:52.780
You can read them offline

58:52.780 --> 58:53.780
A lot of the stuff

58:53.780 --> 58:54.780
Is available in

58:54.780 --> 58:55.780
Podcast-like formats

58:55.780 --> 58:56.780
You can listen in the car

58:56.780 --> 58:57.780
And continue to learn

58:57.780 --> 58:58.780
You know, after you're done

58:58.780 --> 58:59.780
With your JV content, of course

58:59.780 --> 59:00.780
And labs come

59:00.780 --> 59:01.780
With their own servers

59:01.780 --> 59:02.780
Just that alone

59:02.780 --> 59:03.780
Is amazing

59:03.780 --> 59:04.780
You get to a point

59:04.780 --> 59:05.780
In the courseware

59:05.780 --> 59:06.780
Where you need to

59:06.780 --> 59:07.780
Actually implement something

59:07.780 --> 59:08.780
They spin up a VM

59:08.780 --> 59:09.780
For you

59:09.780 --> 59:10.780
Give you a public IP address

59:10.780 --> 59:11.780
Give you logins

59:11.780 --> 59:12.780
You can assign roles

59:12.780 --> 59:13.780
You can work in teams

59:13.780 --> 59:14.780
It's so cool

59:14.780 --> 59:15.780
And they do it automatically

59:15.780 --> 59:16.780
From any seven

59:16.780 --> 59:17.780
Of the

59:17.780 --> 59:18.780
Or more now

59:18.780 --> 59:19.780
Of the Linux distributions

59:19.780 --> 59:20.780
And when you choose

59:20.780 --> 59:21.780
Those Linux distributions

59:21.780 --> 59:22.780
All of the courseware

59:22.780 --> 59:23.780
Automatically adjusts

59:23.780 --> 59:24.780
To match that distro

59:24.780 --> 59:25.780
So if you're moving

59:25.780 --> 59:26.780
Between distros

59:26.780 --> 59:27.780
Or curious how

59:27.780 --> 59:28.780
The other side lives

59:28.780 --> 59:29.780
It's a great way

59:29.780 --> 59:30.780
To do this

59:30.780 --> 59:31.780
They have some great

59:31.780 --> 59:32.780
OpenStack courses

59:32.780 --> 59:33.780
They have great

59:33.780 --> 59:34.780
Puppet courses

59:34.780 --> 59:35.780
All of it

59:35.780 --> 59:36.780
Just go over there

59:36.780 --> 59:37.780
And learn a little something

59:37.780 --> 59:38.780
I hear from folks

59:38.780 --> 59:39.780
All the time

59:39.780 --> 59:40.780
They've gone over there

59:40.780 --> 59:41.780
And said, jeez

59:41.780 --> 59:42.780
I had no idea

59:42.780 --> 59:43.780
How much content was available

59:43.780 --> 59:44.780
I've heard you mention

59:44.780 --> 59:45.780
Some of them

59:45.780 --> 59:46.780
But I had no idea

59:46.780 --> 59:47.780
The sheer amount

59:47.780 --> 59:48.780
You could spend years

59:48.780 --> 59:49.780
On the internet

59:49.780 --> 59:50.780
And I need to enter

59:50.780 --> 59:51.780
In my gnome password

59:51.780 --> 59:52.780
Go over there right now

Try out a few

59:56.780 --> 59:57.780
Of their courseware

59:57.780 --> 59:58.780
The reason I mentioned Puppet

59:58.780 --> 59:59.780
Is because they just

59:59.780 --> 01:00:00.780
Refreshed the Puppet stuff

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.780
And I think if you've got

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:02.780
More than a couple of servers

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:03.780
Now

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:04.780
Or more than a couple of VPSs

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:05.780
This might be something

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:06.780
That's worth looking into

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:07.780
Maybe you want to

01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:08.780
Dip your toe into

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:09.780
Android development

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:10.780
Or OpenStack

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:11.780
Maybe you're one of those

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:12.780
Quote, unquote, DevOps

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:13.780
People all of a sudden

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:14.780
Did you just find yourself out

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:15.780
Did you just find out

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:16.780
Your DevOps

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:17.780
Because I think people

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:18.780
Will learn

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:19.780
Oh wait, this is kind of

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:20.780
A DevOps position

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:21.780
Maybe there's more

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:22.780
I need to learn

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:23.780
Go over there right now

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:24.780
Try it out

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:25.780
And they also have

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:26.780
Scenario-based training

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:27.780
So that way you'll actually

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:28.780
Implement everything from

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:29.780
Setting up the web server

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:30.780
Configuring the security

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:31.780
Getting the CDN caching

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:32.780
Deploying to the website

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:33.780
All of it

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:34.780
It's scenario-based training

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:35.780
So when you walk away

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:36.780
From the course

01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:39.780
You've already done the work

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:40.780
It's not

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:41.780
When you go to do it

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:42.780
In a live production environment

01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:43.780
It won't be the first time

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:44.780
You've ever done it

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:45.780
That kind of confidence

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:46.780
Is invaluable

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:47.780
They've got in-depth resources

01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:48.780
Over at Linux Academy

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:50.780
They've got live Q&A streams

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:51.780
They've got a community

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:52.780
That can help you get going

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:53.780
If you stall out a little bit

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:56.780
If you've got to move into AWS

01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.780
Go take some of their courses first

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.780
If you're managing a PHP server

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:02.780
Go take some of their courses

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:03.780
The list goes, Git

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.780
If you've heard us talk about Git

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:06.780
And you have no idea

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:07.780
What it is or how it works

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:08.780
Or you kind of have a rough idea

01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:09.780
But you've never actually used it

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:10.780
In a practical use case

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:11.780
They've got a course on it

01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:12.780
You want to start doing

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:13.780
Your backups with rsync

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:14.780
They've got a course on it

01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:16.780
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.780
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.780
Go check them out

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:21.780
I'm telling you

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:23.780
Game changer

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:24.780
It's a game changer

01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:26.780
Because it's the difference

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:27.780
Between when you hear

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:30.780
Your general technologist

01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:31.780
Talk about open source and Linux

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:32.780
And they just butcher it

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:33.780
And when you hear

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.780
Linux users talk about Linux stuff

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:36.780
It's that kind of difference

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:37.780
Because it's by the people

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:38.780
That know the material

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:39.780
Through and through

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:42.780
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:43.780
Go check it

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:44.780
It's just

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:46.780
You know what I've noticed?

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.780
All three of the sponsors

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:48.780
In this show

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:49.780
Have the best dashboards

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:51.780
In the industry

01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:53.780
When you log into Linux Academy

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:54.780
All of the courseware is broken out

01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:55.780
How long it's going to take

01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:56.780
And don't even get me started

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:57.780
On their learning plans

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:58.780
Because the learning plans

01:01:58.780 --> 01:01:59.780
You just tell them

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:00.780
Hey, I've got this much time this week

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:02.780
And it automatically generates

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:03.780
Custom courseware

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:05.780
For that availability

01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.780
How slick is that?

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.780
It's the best of breed of technology

01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:10.780
With the best kind of backing

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.780
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:15.780
Go become part of that vibrant community

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:17.780
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:18.780
And a big thank you to Linux Academy

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.780
For sponsoring the unplugged program

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.780
Love it so hard

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:24.780
All right

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:25.780
Before we jump in

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:26.780
If anybody has anything

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:27.780
They want to mention

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:28.780
Feel free

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:29.780
Otherwise I'm going to play

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:30.780
A little bit of the

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:31.780
Mark Shelworth interview

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:32.780
We're doing a little bit

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:33.780
Of a tight show today

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:34.780
Because after the show

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:35.780
If you're listening live

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:36.780
Stick around

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:37.780
We're going to go through

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:38.780
And try to find out

01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:39.780
The best moments

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:40.780
For 2014

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:41.780
My hope is

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:42.780
If we get that done

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:43.780
And I think we can

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:44.780
We've got a good showing today

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:45.780
And I'll also

01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:46.780
Put the link in the show notes

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:47.780
So if you're listening

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:48.780
Afterwards on the download

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:49.780
But there's a moment

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:50.780
You think might be good

01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:51.780
For the best of

01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:52.780
I will have a link

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:53.780
To the form in the show notes

01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:54.780
It just has a few questions

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:55.780
You can fill them out

01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:56.780
And I would really

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:57.780
Appreciate the help

01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:58.780
You don't actually

01:02:58.780 --> 01:02:59.780
Have to be here live

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:00.780
I feel like it's more productive

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:01.780
If we're all here live

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:02.780
Collaborating at the same time

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:03.780
We'll get a good chunk

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:04.780
Of it done

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:05.780
But I have the sense

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:06.780
That we should give

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:07.780
The download audience

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:08.780
A chance to chime in as well

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:09.780
To the show notes

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:10.780
If there was a best moment

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.780
In Jupiter Broadcasting's

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:12.780
2014 run

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:13.780
Help us fill that out

01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:14.780
My goal is

01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:15.780
If we get it all pulled off

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:16.780
We get all the moments noted

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:17.780
Which is the hardest part

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:18.780
Of a best of

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:19.780
Best ofs you'd think

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:20.780
Are less work

01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:21.780
Because you don't have to

01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:22.780
Show up and do a show

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:23.780
But it is way more work

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:24.780
Than doing an actual show

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:25.780
Going through

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:26.780
Especially when you have

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:27.780
As big of a back catalog

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:28.780
As we do

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:29.780
So it's a lot of help

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:30.780
If you have a moment

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:31.780
In your recent memory

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:32.780
And you want to go

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:33.780
Let us know about it

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:34.780
I'll have a link

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:35.780
In the show notes

01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:36.780
I'd really appreciate it

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:37.780
But we're going to do it

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:38.780
And all right

01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:39.780
So let me shift gears

01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:40.780
Let me shift over

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:41.780
To the Mark Shuttleworth interview

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:42.780
I was talking to Mark

01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:44.780
About a lot of things

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:45.780
And I wanted to get his take

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.780
On essentially if the tone

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:50.780
Of conversation

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:51.780
Has been getting

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:52.780
More and more hostile

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:53.780
And why is that?

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:54.780
Why is the tone

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.780
As bad as it is?

01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:56.780
And what can we do?

01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.780
These are a couple of questions

01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:58.780
That I started to ask Mark

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:00.780
And he jumped in with

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:01.780
I thought some pretty good

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:02.780
Commentary on the topic

01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:03.780
So here's just a couple

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:04.780
Of minute pull out

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:05.780
From the whole interview

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:06.780
Which we'll have

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:07.780
In Sunday's

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:08.780
Linux action show

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:09.780
Just tell people

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:10.780
To stop

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.780
And ask them

01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:12.780
Why they're involved

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:13.780
And what they're involved in

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:14.780
Right?

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:15.780
If you're just here

01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:16.780
To be a talking head

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:17.780
Then

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.780
And you're just going to

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:21.780
Bring opinions

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:22.780
To the table

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:23.780
Then you need to

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:24.780
Back off

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:25.780
Because we're trying

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:26.780
To get stuff done here

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:27.780
Do you think it's the result

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:28.780
Of the size of the communities

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:29.780
Now that there's

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:30.780
Now there's just

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:31.780
So many people involved

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:32.780
That there's just not as many

01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:33.780
People actually producing code?

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:34.780
Well, no

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:35.780
I think it's

01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:36.780
I think it's more

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:37.780
Got to do with the fact

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:38.780
That it's so easy

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:39.780
To contribute an opinion

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:40.780
Because of

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:41.780
Because of the evolution

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:42.780
Of sort of

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:43.780
The social thing

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:44.780
Right, right

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:45.780
So it used to be

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:46.780
That if you wanted

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:47.780
To have an opinion

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:48.780
On how Debian did something

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:49.780
You needed to show up

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:50.780
You needed to become

01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:51.780
A Debian developer

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:52.780
You needed to go through

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:53.780
A process that essentially

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.780
Gave you a sophisticated understanding

01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:56.780
Of how all the parts

01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:57.780
Fit together

01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:58.780
And who's contributing what

01:04:58.780 --> 01:04:59.780
And who's responsible for what

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:00.780
And get a sense

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:01.780
Of the culture

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:02.780
Because now you can just

01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:03.780
You can just throw comments

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:04.780
At LWN

01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:05.780
On Slashdot

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:06.780
Or somewhere else

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:07.780
Right

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:08.780
So I think that's

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:09.780
The real issue

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:10.780
And it's the same thing

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:11.780
With Gamergate

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:12.780
Right

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:13.780
It's this

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:14.780
It's that

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:15.780
In a sense

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:16.780
It's so cheap

01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:17.780
Just to throw another opinion

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:18.780
On the fire

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:19.780
And in some ways

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:20.780
It's rewarding

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:21.780
To put out an opinion

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:22.780
That's somehow polarized

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:23.780
And so as a result

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:24.780
We get a lot of

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:25.780
Polarizing opinions

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:26.780
It's not

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:27.780
Not surprising

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:28.780
Right

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:29.780
But I do think

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:30.780
We have to

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:31.780
We have to be willing

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:32.780
To defend our communities

01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:33.780
For it

01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:34.780
And continue to invest

01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:35.780
In building a clear

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:36.780
Constructive conversation

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:37.780
For people

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:38.780
Who want to

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:39.780
Get stuff done

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:40.780
And that's why

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:41.780
We

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:42.780
I think

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:43.780
Continue to

01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:44.780
To just

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:45.780
You know

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:46.780
Steamroller forward

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:47.780
Not just with Unity

01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:48.780
And Ubuntu

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:49.780
But actually across

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:50.780
Huge tracts

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:51.780
Of

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:52.780
Free software

01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:53.780
Right

01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:54.780
Because people feel

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:55.780
They can come there

01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:56.780
Be part of that conversation

01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:57.780
And get stuff done

01:05:57.780 --> 01:05:58.780
Yeah

01:05:58.780 --> 01:05:59.780
We have an incredible

01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:00.780
Community council

01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:01.780
That are very thoughtful

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:02.780
And supportive

01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:03.780
And also

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:04.780
You know

01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:05.780
We

01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:06.780
We don't fool ourselves

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:07.780
That you can have a technical

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:08.780
Meritocratic decision

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:09.780
By 500 people

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:10.780
Right

01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:11.780
You take a decision

01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:12.780
As to the three people

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:13.780
Who need to make a decision

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:14.780
And then

01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:15.780
Yeah

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:16.780
They get on

01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:17.780
And do it

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:18.780
Right

01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:19.780
Right

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:20.780
So what do you think guys?

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:21.780
I'll start

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:22.780
Let's start at the bottom there

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:23.780
Wimpy

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.780
Is it just

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:25.780
Is it that comments

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:26.780
Are cheap

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:27.780
And that anybody

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:28.780
Can have an opinion

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:29.780
And that's what's moved

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:30.780
The tone forward

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:31.780
Or is it

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:32.780
The beliefs

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:33.780
Of how technology

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:34.780
Should be implemented

01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:35.780
And it's really coming down

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:36.780
To more of a

01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:37.780
Philosophical difference?

01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:38.780
What

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:39.780
What do you

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:40.780
What's your sense of it

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:41.780
Wimpy?

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:42.780
I think that it's

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:43.780
The first thing

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:44.780
I think that it is

01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:45.780
Far too easy

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:46.780
For people

01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:47.780
To contribute

01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:48.780
Comments

01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:49.780
To a wide

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:50.780
Audience

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:51.780
That don't

01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:52.780
Necessarily

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:53.780
Understand all

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:54.780
Of the technical merits

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:55.780
Of the discussion

01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:56.780
And repeat

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:57.780
Sound bites

01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:58.780
And clips

01:06:58.780 --> 01:06:59.780
That they've picked up

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:00.780
From

01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:01.780
Other places

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:02.780
Elsewhere

01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:03.780
It's

01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:04.780
It's

01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:05.780
So it's sort of like

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:06.780
Opinions

01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:07.780
Are

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:08.780
Sort of like

01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:09.780
A dime a dozen

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:10.780
Everybody's got one

01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:11.780
I want to ask

01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:12.780
But sometimes

01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:13.780
Sometimes not their own

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:14.780
They're

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:15.780
They're repackaging

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:16.780
Other people's opinions

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:17.780
Not necessarily

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:18.780
Technically accurate

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:19.780
Opinions

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:20.780
And passing them off

01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:21.780
As their own

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:22.780
Boy

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:23.780
You see that in political debates

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:24.780
All the time

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:25.780
Right?

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:26.780
Yeah

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:27.780
And you've

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:28.780
And you've identified

01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:29.780
A few

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:30.780
Problems with the quality

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:31.780
Of this

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:32.780
Of you know

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:33.780
Pinging backwards and forwards

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:34.780
And citing each other

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:35.780
Over

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:36.780
System D

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:37.780
Rotten Corpse

01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:38.780
Do you have the sense though

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:39.780
That

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:40.780
Some of it is also

01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:41.780
That maybe there's

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:42.780
Less technically savvy people

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:43.780
Involved now

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:44.780
And they're not understanding

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:45.780
The nuances

01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:46.780
Of the discussion?

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:47.780
Well that

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:48.780
That goes with the

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:49.780
Repackaging as well

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:50.780
But the problem is that

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:51.780
The

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:52.780
The people who

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:53.780
Are

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:54.780
Providing those

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:55.780
Repackaging

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:56.780
Opinions

01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:57.780
They don't know

01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:58.780
As well

01:07:58.780 --> 01:07:59.780
So there's a lot of people

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:00.780
Who are talking about

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:01.780
They don't understand

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:02.780
The

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:03.780
The topic

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:04.780
The technical part of the topic

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:05.780
But then they're acting like

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:06.780
They do

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:07.780
And then spreading more

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:08.780
Misinformation that is

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:09.780
Then spread again

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:10.780
And it just

01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:11.780
You know

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:12.780
It just

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:13.780
Rolls

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:14.780
Keeps rolling on

01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:15.780
Becomes bigger and bigger

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:16.780
Web wizard

01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:17.780
Break it down for me

01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:18.780
You say

01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:19.780
You would argue

01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:20.780
One is because of the other

01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:21.780
What do you mean?

01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:22.780
So basically

01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:23.780
When you go in

01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:24.780
You look at this

01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:25.780
And you say

01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:26.780
Look at these

01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:27.780
These opinions

01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:28.780
Are that way

01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:29.780
And then there's these arguments

01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:30.780
And then we have to argue it out

01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:31.780
Between

01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:32.780
You know

01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:33.780
500 people

01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:34.780
3 people

01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:35.780
Whatever

01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:36.780
It's

01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:37.780
It comes down to

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:38.780
Well

01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:39.780
I'm arguing this

01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:40.780
Because of this reason

01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:41.780
And

01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:42.780
I know my reason is right

01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:43.780
There's nothing that makes it wrong

01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:44.780
So therefore

01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:45.780
You must be wrong

01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:46.780
And the other person

01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:47.780
Has nothing wrong

01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:48.780
With their argument either

01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:49.780
But they're thinking

01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:50.780
The exact same thing

01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:51.780
There's nothing wrong

01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:52.780
With my argument

01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:53.780
You must be wrong

01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:54.780
And this is

01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:55.780
And then you go

01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:56.780
And you have each other

01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:57.780
And you're both insistent

01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:58.780
That the other is wrong

01:08:58.780 --> 01:08:59.780
Because there's nothing wrong

01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:00.780
With my argument

01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:01.780
Urban

01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:02.780
Do you feel like

01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:03.780
People have to pass a test

01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:04.780
Before they can give

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:05.780
Their opinions online

01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:06.780
On technical issues?

01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:07.780
Like a technical

01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:08.780
Qualifications test?

01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:09.780
No

01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:10.780
I'm not that far

01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:11.780
But I think that

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:12.780
People should give

01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:13.780
And need to give

01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:14.780
Their opinions

01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:15.780
But only if they know

01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:16.780
What they're talking about

01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:17.780
If they don't have

01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:18.780
A technical background

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:19.780
To

01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:20.780
To say about

01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:21.780
Any systems

01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:22.780
They should

01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:23.780
Shut up

01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:24.780
About system D

01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:25.780
I think everybody

01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:26.780
Thinks they know

01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:27.780
What they're talking about

01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:28.780
Right?

01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:29.780
That's part of the problem

01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:30.780
Because everybody thinks

01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:31.780
They've got it figured out

01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:32.780
All right, Lionhead

01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:33.780
I want to ask you a question

01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:34.780
You and I

01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:35.780
We sit here almost

01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:36.780
Every morning

01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:38.780
On Tech Talk today

01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:39.780
And we talk about

01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:40.780
Technology news

01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:41.780
We are one of these

01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:42.780
Commentators that

01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:43.780
Mark is talking about

01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:44.780
Are we, Lionhead

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:45.780
You and I

01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:46.780
Part of the problem?

01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:47.780
No

01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:48.780
I don't really think so

01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:49.780
Because

01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:50.780
At least for myself

01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:51.780
I know my limitations

01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:52.780
And I try to

01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:53.780
Angle my point of view

01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:58.780
From what I actually do know

01:09:58.780 --> 01:09:59.780
And if I don't know something

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:00.780
I completely acknowledge that

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:01.780
Yeah, so

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:02.780
There is that kind of

01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:03.780
View as well

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:04.780
Know your own limits

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:05.780
Kind of thing

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:06.780
Before you jump in

01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:07.780
Yeah

01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:08.780
That's a good point

01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:09.780
You know

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:10.780
And something else

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:11.780
Mark says in the interview

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:12.780
Is that

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:13.780
Part of it is

01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:14.780
Human psychology

01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:15.780
It can be kind of satisfying

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:16.780
To go online

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:17.780
And drop a big wisdom bomb

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:18.780
When everybody knows

01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:19.780
What they're talking about

01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:20.780
Right?

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:21.780
Yeah

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:22.780
Yeah

01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:23.780
And drop a big wisdom bomb

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:24.780
When everybody

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:25.780
Be like

01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:26.780
Boom, here's my point

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:27.780
Look at me

01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:28.780
I thought of this

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:29.780
You know

01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:30.780
And it's sort of a

01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:31.780
Satisfying kind of feeling

01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:32.780
A sensation for some people

01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:33.780
And so it's a little

01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:34.780
Human nature to do it too

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:35.780
To jump in on something

01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:36.780
We all care about

01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:37.780
And also

01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:38.780
The thing about the

01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:39.780
The three people

01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:40.780
Versus 500 people

01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:41.780
Is not the argument

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:42.780
Of opinion versus opinion

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:43.780
It's more of the argument

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:44.780
That three people

01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:45.780
Having a discussion

01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:46.780
Is a lot easier to compromise

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:47.780
Than 500 people

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:48.780
You know

01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:49.780
Let's ask Charlie a question

01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:51.780
I'm always extremely curious

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:52.780
How much of all

01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:53.780
Of the inner turmoil

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:54.780
And drama

01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:55.780
Inside these open source

01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:56.780
Projects

01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:57.780
Actually leaks out

01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:58.780
Into real world

01:10:58.780 --> 01:10:59.780
So Charlie

01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:00.780
When you're talking about

01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:01.780
Linux and open source

01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:02.780
And people developing software

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:03.780
All over the world

01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:04.780
Do you also say

01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:05.780
And by the way

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:06.780
They fight a lot

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:07.780
Is there a disclaimer?

01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:08.780
Do you say

01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:09.780
Sometimes it's treacherous?

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:10.780
What's that look like?

01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:11.780
How do you prepare people

01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:12.780
That might be looking

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:13.780
Into the open source world

01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:14.780
For the first time?

01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:15.780
Or does it

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:16.780
Not even come up?

01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:17.780
Well I think

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:18.780
I think it's a huge concern

01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:19.780
Actually

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:20.780
I think part of my role

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:21.780
As an IT leader

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:22.780
For the district

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:23.780
For our organization

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:24.780
Is to

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:25.780
Well first off

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:26.780
I keep up with this

01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:27.780
As much as I can

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:28.780
Again I'm not a developer

01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:29.780
So some of the finer points

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:30.780
You know escape me

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:31.780
But

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:32.780
I think what's key

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:33.780
Is that from my

01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:34.780
Perspective

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:35.780
I need to

01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:36.780
Have at least

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:37.780
A finger in the pulse

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:38.780
So I can get a sense

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:39.780
As to whether or not

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:40.780
Projects are going to

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:41.780
Live or die

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:42.780
Sure

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:43.780
You know for us again

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:44.780
Everything that we do

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:45.780
I think about

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:46.780
From the enterprise

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:47.780
Perspective

01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:48.780
You know so not just

01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:49.780
The immediate

01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:50.780
People that support this

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:51.780
You know over

01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:52.780
Three five

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:53.780
Maybe even ten years

01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:54.780
So you know I think

01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:55.780
That the infighting

01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:56.780
On a lot of projects

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:57.780
It does certainly

01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:58.780
Concern me because

01:11:58.780 --> 01:11:59.780
You know again

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:00.780
I've seen many

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:01.780
You know many projects

01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:03.780
That you know were

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:04.780
Potentially killed

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:05.780
Or strangled by

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:06.780
You know a community

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:07.780
That just sometimes

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:09.780
Can't get their act together

01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:10.780
Now I don't

01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:11.780
That's not an indictment

01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:13.780
You know I think that's also

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:14.780
A tremendous strength

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:15.780
Of open source

01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:16.780
And developing software

01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:17.780
In the open

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:18.780
You know so again

01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:19.780
From my perspective

01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:20.780
It's a big concern

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:21.780
I think what it doesn't do

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:22.780
Is it doesn't necessarily

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:24.780
Help you know schools

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:25.780
That you know by nature

01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:27.780
Are not technical

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:28.780
You know they're looking

01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:29.780
For fast easy simple

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:30.780
Fantastic educational solutions

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.780
So the minutia

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.780
Of technical arguments

01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:34.780
You know it doesn't

01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:37.780
Really help the conversation

01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:38.780
So I don't know if that's

01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:39.780
What you're looking for

01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:40.780
In terms of that question

01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:41.780
But that's my perspective on it

01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:42.780
I didn't even think about it

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:43.780
In the fact of

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:44.780
If I'm looking for

01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:45.780
An enterprise and I'm looking

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:46.780
To get something that

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:47.780
You know multi-year

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.780
Sustainability out of

01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:50.780
Of course

01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:52.780
Of course the drama

01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:53.780
Of a community

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:54.780
Would be a concern

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:55.780
And it almost becomes

01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:56.780
The responsibility of the person

01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:57.780
That's trying to implement

01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:58.780
That technology

01:12:58.780 --> 01:12:59.780
At least have a bit

01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:00.780
Of an understanding

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:01.780
Of how volatile the project is

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:02.780
Because in open source

01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:03.780
You know it's not the mighty dollar

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:04.780
That drives that project

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:05.780
It's the passion

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:06.780
Of the contributors

01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:07.780
In a lot of cases

01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:08.780
In a lot of cases

01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:09.780
So that makes so much sense

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:10.780
That that would be

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:11.780
That if you're sitting back

01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:12.780
And watching a project

01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:13.780
Right now

01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:14.780
And you see a project

01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:15.780
That's just falling apart

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:16.780
You're not going to want

01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:17.780
To bet the farm

01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:18.780
On that for five years

01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:19.780
You're going to try to find

01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:20.780
Maybe something else

01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:21.780
That's maybe a little stable

01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:22.780
Maybe a little

01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:23.780
A little more tame

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:24.780
Well ironically

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:25.780
You would have thought

01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:26.780
That would be Debian

01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:27.780
You know

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:28.780
You would have thought

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:29.780
That was Debian to a T

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:30.780
But watching them fall apart

01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:31.780
It even happens there too

01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:32.780
I mean not fall apart

01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:33.780
That's kind of

01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:34.780
Putting it over the top

01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:35.780
But obviously

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:36.780
They've been having issues

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:37.780
And that's critical too

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:38.780
Because education

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:39.780
Again I'm speaking specifically

01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:40.780
From education

01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:41.780
But you know

01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:42.780
Educational leaders

01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:43.780
I mean they

01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:44.780
They have limited dollars

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:45.780
To begin with

01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:46.780
And it doesn't

01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:47.780
You know

01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:48.780
By the same token

01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:49.780
But you know

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:50.780
With when you're betting

01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:51.780
On open source projects

01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:52.780
In general

01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:53.780
It's not as if

01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:54.780
You know

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:55.780
We can just turn

01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:56.780
To another vendor

01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:57.780
And say hey

01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:58.780
Help support this

01:13:58.780 --> 01:13:59.780
You know

01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:00.780
We are

01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:01.780
One of the downsides

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:02.780
Of our current position

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:03.780
Is that

01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:04.780
You know

01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:05.780
I can't just

01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:06.780
Easily go out

01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:07.780
And get support

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:08.780
For the projects

01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:09.780
And programs

01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:10.780
That we have in place here

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:11.780
Now I'm incredibly fortunate

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:12.780
To have a phenomenal team

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:13.780
Of technologists

01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:14.780
You know

01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:15.780
Because they're just

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:16.780
Great technologists

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:17.780
But you know

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:18.780
If I didn't have

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:19.780
That internal support

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:20.780
I would be at the mercy

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:21.780
Of vendors

01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:22.780
And again

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:23.780
That's an incredibly precarious

01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:24.780
And dangerous position

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:25.780
For a school district

01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:26.780
Or any organization

01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:27.780
That can't turn to

01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:28.780
You know

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:29.780
Somebody or something

01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:30.780
For support

01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:31.780
Absolutely

01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:32.780
Rotten Corps

01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:33.780
You have a question

01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:34.780
For Charlie

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:35.780
Go ahead

01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:36.780
Yeah I was wondering

01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:37.780
Do you find it more

01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:38.780
There's

01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:39.780
Based on when you

01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:40.780
Started doing this

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:41.780
Do you

01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:42.780
Is it more recently

01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:43.780
Have you noticed

01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:44.780
A difference

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:45.780
In Debian

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:46.780
Or anything

01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:47.780
In particular

01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:48.780
Linux community

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:49.780
Based on before

01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:50.780
Because at

01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:51.780
At one point

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:52.780
Like Debian has not changed

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:53.780
How they do anything

01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:54.780
They caught

01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:55.780
There's a lot of people

01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:56.780
Leaving and coming and going

01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:57.780
And there's hundreds of people

01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:58.780
Working on Debian

01:14:58.780 --> 01:14:59.780
And people leave

01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:00.780
Because of different

01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:01.780
You know

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:02.780
Opinions

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:03.780
But now that they can

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:04.780
Make it public

01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:05.780
And that media people

01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:06.780
Pick it up

01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:07.780
Do you think that has

01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:08.780
Any effector

01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:09.780
For the

01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:10.780
The perception

01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:11.780
That people have

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:12.780
For this

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:13.780
Yeah

01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:14.780
Yeah

01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:15.780
Just kind of

01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:16.780
Thinking out loud

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:17.780
Yeah and I guess

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:18.780
It

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:19.780
You know it's tough

01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:20.780
And I'm not as

01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:21.780
You know

01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:22.780
Up to speed

01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:23.780
On those specific

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:25.780
Arguments and discussions

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:26.780
You know I think

01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:27.780
I guess the key is

01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:28.780
You know just

01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:29.780
The tone of these

01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:30.780
Again these tend to be

01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:31.780
Incredibly technical

01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:33.780
You know

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:34.780
Sometimes vanity

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:35.780
Discussions

01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:36.780
Very much

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:37.780
And you know

01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:38.780
I just

01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:39.780
It doesn't help

01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:40.780
You know it just doesn't

01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:41.780
It just doesn't help

01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:42.780
You know the

01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:43.780
The tech industry itself

01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:44.780
Finds itself fighting

01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:45.780
All the time

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:46.780
Over

01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:47.780
You know Apple

01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:48.780
Versus Microsoft

01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:49.780
You know iOS

01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:50.780
Versus Android

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:51.780
You know I think

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:52.780
What we do in

01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:53.780
Our industry

01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:54.780
Again just

01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:55.780
In fighting

01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:56.780
Doesn't add to

01:15:56.780 --> 01:15:57.780
It just doesn't add

01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:58.780
To you know

01:15:58.780 --> 01:15:59.780
To anything

01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:00.780
For technical leaders

01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:01.780
So again without

01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:02.780
Knowing all of the

01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:03.780
You know all the details

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:04.780
The arguments

01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:05.780
Yeah I just

01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:06.780
I just think it

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:07.780
Makes it more difficult

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:08.780
You know I think we should

01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:09.780
All be focused on

01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:10.780
Working together

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:11.780
In these programs

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:12.780
And trying to minimize

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:13.780
You know the

01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:14.780
The strife

01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:15.780
Yeah preach it

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:16.780
Alright Charlie can

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:17.780
Will you do me a favor

01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:18.780
Give it

01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:19.780
Give everybody down

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:20.780
I'll give you a countdown

01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:21.780
And when I get to one

01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:22.780
Hold down the

01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:23.780
Push to talk

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:24.780
And have everybody in the room

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:25.780
Say

01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:26.780
Linux unplugged alright

01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:27.780
In three

01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:28.780
Two

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:29.780
One

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:30.780
Linux unplugged

01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:31.780
We gotta try that again

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:32.780
Come on whole group

01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:33.780
Three

01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:34.780
Two

01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:35.780
We totally have to try that again

01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:36.780
He's gonna give us a countdown

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:37.780
To screaming

01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:38.780
Linux unplugged

01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:39.780
Yeah we wanna get

01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:40.780
The whole room in there

01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:41.780
The whole room

01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:42.780
Let's see if we can just

01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:43.780
Break the whole thing in

01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:44.780
Three

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:45.780
Two

01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:46.780
One

01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:47.780
Linux unplugged

01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:48.780
That's pretty good

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:49.780
Alright thanks guys

01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:50.780
Alright well

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:51.780
We'll wrap it up right there

01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:52.780
I think

01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:53.780
We gotta get out of here

01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:54.780
Cause we got some

01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:55.780
Thanksgiving shenanigans

01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:56.780
Here in the U.S.

01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:57.780
To prepare for

01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:58.780
Matt we're gonna have

01:16:58.780 --> 01:16:59.780
A great show on Sunday

01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:00.780
We got not only

01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:01.780
The Shuttleworth interview

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:02.780
We got all our other

01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:03.780
Regular stuff

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:04.780
Are you ready

01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:05.780
I'm so ready

01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:06.780
Yes

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:07.780
Alright you bring it

01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:08.780
I'll make sure that

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:09.780
I know

01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:10.780
I know

01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:11.780
Don't worry Matt

01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:12.780
I'll get bacon

01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:13.780
I can handle that

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:14.780
Alright so those of you

01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:15.780

01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:18.780
Our best of summary

01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:19.780

Alright everybody

01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:34.780
Thanks so much

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:35.780
For tuning this week's episode

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:36.780
Of Linux Unplugged

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:37.780
See you right back here

01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:38.780
See you

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:39.780
Bye

01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:20.380
Well that was fun, thanks everybody.

01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:24.780
It was a little tricky making one laptop work for everybody in the room but I think it turned

01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:26.900
out okay and we had a good discussion.

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:28.380
So that was nice.

01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:33.060
So we're gonna sort of shut down here and switch over to our best of thing but let's

01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:35.660
go over to the JB Titles real quick and pick ourselves a title before we do that.

01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:39.220
We got some business to take care of before we run and I don't know man, I didn't see

01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:42.860
a lot of title suggestions.

01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:44.460
Repackage your opinion, that's pretty good.

01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:47.460
I kind of like that.

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:48.940
Cool kids use Linux.

01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:55.280
JBTitles.com, JBTitles.com, er buddy boat.

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.580
Know your technical limits.

01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:57.580
That's pretty good.

01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.700
Yeah, know your limits is good.

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.660
Unplugged education, I like that.

01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:02.660
That's good too.

01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:04.100
Unplugged, I'm gonna give that a boat right now.

01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:05.100
Good one Keller.

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:08.900
Let's see, let's see, let's see.

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:09.900
What's that?

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:10.900
Unplugged education?

01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:11.900
Unplugging education.

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:12.900
Oh, I suppose, yeah.

01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:14.580
Yeah, like get rid of that thing.

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:17.420
Get it out of here.

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:21.100
Yeah, maybe we could just get, maybe we could just loan Charlie out to different school

01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:22.100
districts.

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:23.100
That'd be cool, right?

01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:24.100
Yeah.

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:25.900
That was neat they were able to join us during the school day over there.

01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:26.900
That was awesome.

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:29.860
It's got to be getting close to the end of the day for them, right?

01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:30.860
I would think so.

01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:32.500
East Coast, they're 511 over there.

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:33.500
Yeah, oh boy.

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:34.780
Well, a big thank you to them for joining us.

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:35.780
That was really cool.

01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:36.780
Yeah.

01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:41.220
All right, JBtelus.com, we'll go pick a title and then get, did you guys hear about this

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:42.220
Sony hack?

01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:43.220
Matt, have you heard about this?

01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:44.220
Yes.

01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:45.220
Where they replaced, it's Sony Pictures.

01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:50.220
I guess it's the movie arm, but like this has got to be a Windows vulnerability they're

01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:56.300
taking advantage of here because it's full screen images and holding data for ransom,

01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:59.100
taking over Twitter accounts, replacing Google Play apps.

01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:03.900
This is a massive breach and it's of course the week we take TechSnap up.

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:06.100
Oh man.

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:11.460
Well in hindsight though, it'll allow more things to develop over time and you can come

01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:12.460
back to it.

01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:13.460
We do like them deets.

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:14.460
That's a good point.

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:15.460
Yeah.

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:17.700
All right, JBtitles.com, unplugged education.

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:20.460
I do like it, but I could see the negative connotation.

01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:22.740
Repackage your opinions would be good too though.

01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:23.740
Linux powered schools.

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:27.340
Cool kids use Linux.

01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:29.660
School of Linux, cool kids use Linux again.

01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:31.860
Open source education.

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:32.860
Linux in schools is cool.

01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:37.420
Boy, I would have loved to have been a student back when that was going on.

01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:41.140
That would have been so neat.

01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:43.540
All right, last chance and then we're going to run.

01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:47.260
Last chance and unplugged education is racking up the top, but there's still a chance.

01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:48.260
Everybody go over there and boat.

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:49.260
Repackage your education.

01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:50.260
Boat.

01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:51.260
Nice.

01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:52.260
Nice.

01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:53.260
Nice.

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:54.260
Oh, yes.

01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:55.260
Boat, boat, boat.

01:20:55.260 --> 01:21:00.260
I think he's done, the school sounds really interesting.

01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:01.260
Yeah.

01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:03.260
I agree.

01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:05.340
I wish my school did that.

01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:06.340
No kidding.

01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:07.340
Yeah.

01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:08.340
Yeah, I mean the best you're going to get-

01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:10.380
I'm still in school, so I have a chance to change it.

01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:16.340
The best you're usually going to get in school is freaking Chromebooks.

01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:17.340
Yeah.

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:24.260
I would have loved to have anything remotely relevant to computer class.

01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:25.260
Yeah.

01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:31.220
I don't think it really counts to your entire, your entire school.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.740
Your entire hour of the class is Mavis Beacon.

01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:35.740
Or Organ Trail.

01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:37.060
Or Organ Trail on an old Mac.

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:38.740
Now, don't doubt Organ Trail.

01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:40.060
That's how I learned about dysentery.

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.060
Come on now.

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:42.060
Exactly.

01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:47.380
I learned how to do punch cards in computer science at school.

01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:48.380
Oh, wait.

01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:49.380
Boom.

01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:50.380
Static.

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:51.380
Static.

01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:55.380
Well, now, that's been a really useful skill set that you've been able to bring forward.

01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:56.460
Yeah.

01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:59.780
Even when I was taught it, it was about 20 years out of date, I think.

01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:00.780
Oh, wow.

01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.780
Did you have hanging chads?

01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:03.780
Yeah.

01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:08.780
Did you ever, like, drop all your punch cards and get them all mixed up?

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:09.780
Oh, God.

01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:10.780
Yeah.

01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:11.780
Yeah.

01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:12.780
Done that.

01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:13.780
Yeah.

01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:19.260
And also, we had the paper tape as well, which, frankly, it's only practical application is

01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:21.060
removing fingerprints.

01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:22.060
Wow.

01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:28.940
I was going to say, the last person that I heard that actually used to tape drive to

01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:33.860
go and take it, well, sorry, a regular paper tape with punch holes in it was my teacher,

01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:35.420
and she's nearly 16 now.

01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:36.420
Yeah.

01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:37.420
Yeah.

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:38.980
It's an older generation thing for sure.

01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:39.980
Yeah.

01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:40.980
I'm not that old.

01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:45.380
Like I say, it was well out of date when I was at school, but this was the quality of

01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:47.500
computer education.

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.700
I want to find one just to experiment with it.

01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:50.700
Yeah.

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:51.700
It'll be kind of fun.

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:55.740
My father-in-law has still got one from the mainframe systems he used to operate at Heinz,

01:22:55.740 --> 01:23:01.660
so yeah, maybe I'll dig that out at Christmas and take some photos.

01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:04.380
Well, schools have got slightly better.

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:08.380
Their only perception of Linux in books at the moment is Ubuntu.

01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:09.380
Yeah.

01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:17.540
That's a de facto screenshot for every single one I've seen.

01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:20.580
I wonder if, yeah, I mean, hmm.

01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:22.580
Redhead desktop's pretty popular too.

01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:23.580
Okay.

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:27.420
I can see Ubuntu, and especially with the Edubuntu spin and Zubuntu, being pretty useful

01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:28.420
for schools.

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:29.420
Yeah.

01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:30.420
And Ubuntu Monte.

01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:31.420
Yeah.

01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:32.420
Oh yeah.

01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:33.420
Yeah.

01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:34.420
Yeah.

01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:35.420
Oh yeah.

01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:36.420
In fact, Wimpy, we were going to-

01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:37.420
Nice plug.

01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:38.420
Yeah.

01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:39.420
There was a...

01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:40.420
You were telling me about a pretty big deployment of...

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:41.420
In fact, that was something I was going to ask Charlie if they've played with Linux terminal

01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:42.420
services at all.

01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:43.420
Yes.

01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:44.420
When I was.

01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:45.420
That's what I used.

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:46.420
Yeah.

01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:52.860
There's a few in the embryonic stages at the moment, and I can't really say too much about

01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:56.980
it at the moment because it might happen and it might not, and if it looks like it's definitely

01:23:56.980 --> 01:24:01.100
going to happen, I shall be sure to fill you in on the details.

01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:03.140
But here's a little teaser.

01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:06.700
The Ex2Go Gathering was sponsored by IBM.

01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:07.700
Hmm.

01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:08.700
Really?

01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:09.700
IBM?

01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:17.820
And they like those PowerPC things, and they contracted Canonical to port Ubuntu to PowerPC

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:18.820
recently.

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:19.820
Oh, wow.

01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:20.900
Oh, I didn't realize that.

01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:26.780
You know, that would have been a good answer for the emailer who was saying, how do I repurpose

01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:53.500
these old XP and PowerPC Macs as maybe Linux terminal services?
