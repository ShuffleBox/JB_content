1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
There's a lot of news today in the show.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,840
But this one, I'm just still reading the room.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,800
Microsoft is said to be in discussions

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,440
to buy Discord for over $10 billion.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,840
And you can see the advantage for Microsoft.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,560
They could immediately get a very relevant chat platform.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,740
There's potential integrations with their Xbox chat platform

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,880
there.

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,800
And they'd probably be willing to architect

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,880
in a way that makes surveillance entirely possible,

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,880
like they did for Skype.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,660
So it's just a win for regulators.

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,120
It's a win for corporations.

14
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,200
It's a win for the Discord founders.

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,600
It doesn't feel like a win for the users, though.

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,880
And I wonder if this is going to be like a Matrix sale,

17
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,960
essentially.

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,480
Everybody check out Matrix.

19
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,720
It's over here, and it's great.

20
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,240
What?

21
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,920
You don't think they'll open source it?

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,080
No, I don't.

23
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,580
I don't.

24
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:57,920
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,840
My name is Chris.

26
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,960
My name is Wes.

27
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,400
Hello, Wes, and yes, I am smelling what you're cooking,

28
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,000
but I'm just not sure about a crock pie in the studio.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,520
Oh, you'll see later, buddy.

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,720
We'll see about that.

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,360
And I want to thank A Cloud Guru for sponsoring this episode.

32
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,640
It is brought to you by A Cloud Guru.

33
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,640
They are the leader in learning for the cloud,

34
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,280
Linux, and other modern tech skills.

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,640
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs.

36
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,720
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

37
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,180
Well, on today's episode, we're just kind of having fun,

38
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,920
because we're getting close to 400,

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,320
and we wanted to share one of our favorite WireGuard-powered

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,000
tricks to get around your ISP and get any system you

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,920
have behind a net, a public IP, and accessible

42
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,080
from the internet.

43
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,600
We do this often, so that way the chat room can abuse a box

44
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,720
that we have on our LAN.

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,520
So we've set up a hot box on Linode,

46
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,400
and we'll walk you through our favorite way

47
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,560
of accomplishing this trick.

48
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,440
It's pretty straightforward.

49
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,540
And we'll also chat with a new business that's

50
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,460
built on top of WireGuard and Linux that's

51
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,240
trying to make this even easier for you.

52
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,900
Plus, we have a bunch of community news.

53
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,840
We've got feedback.

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,800
We've got probably some pics if we've got time.

55
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,680
But more importantly, we have our esteemed room

56
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,960
of internet experts.

57
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,000
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,080
Hello, Virtual Lug.

59
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,580
Hello.

60
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,080
Hello, Chris.

61
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,580
Hello.

62
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,080
Hello.

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,580
Hello.

64
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,320
Namaste.

65
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,480
A special hello to Dan the Rabbit in there

66
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,440
from Elementary OS.

67
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,080
Hello, Dan.

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,160
Nice to see you.

69
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,400
Hey, how's it going?

70
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,920
Also, Dalton Durst from Ubuntu Touch Project

71
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,800
is in there as well.

72
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,440
Hello, Dalton.

73
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,120
Cha-cha.

74
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,960
Hello.

75
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,680
Good to have you.

76
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,760
Of course, lots of friends.

77
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,120
We have lots of friends that we always have,

78
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,420
returning friends, too, in here.

79
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,880
So Brent, it's good to see you've been a little bit,

80
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,080
too.

81
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,880
Hope you're well.

82
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,560
I'm good.

83
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,120
I'm good.

84
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,920
Thanks for having me.

85
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,440
And of course, thank you to everyone

86
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,360
who makes it all the time.

87
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,160
We've got 17 people in there in total.

88
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,200
We have some in the quiet listening and most everybody

89
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,000
in the on-air room.

90
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,520
That's one of the things you can use our Mumble Room for

91
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,920
is just a live, low latency, very, very low latency,

92
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,580
high quality audio stream if you just want a live stream using

93
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,160
free software.

94
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,960
And then the whole stack's free because we're

95
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,360
doing it on Linux using free software

96
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,240
and you'd be listening on free software.

97
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,600
So that's a cool way to listen to a podcast

98
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,160
about free software.

99
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,040
But we really actually have a lot to get to,

100
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,360
so I should stop fooling around.

101
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,920
And there is some breaking news this week.

102
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,480
This is CNN breaking news.

103
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,200
By the time we come on the air, it

104
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,360
is becoming more and more known that Richard Stallman is back

105
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,420
at the Free Software Foundation on the board.

106
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,120
He's not running it like the president,

107
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,240
but he is on the board.

108
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,400
And Stallman, as we have talked about on the show before,

109
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,540
he is a hard man to like, as Lawrence Lessig put it.

110
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,440
He's driven.

111
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
He's often impatient.

112
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,460
His anger can flare at friends as easily it does foes.

113
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,760
And he is uncompromising.

114
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,280
And he is persistent.

115
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,440
And he is patient.

116
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,280
That is something else about Richard Stallman

117
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,080
is he is willing to wait for a long time.

118
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,840
And so this week at a live event,

119
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,360
he announced that he was back.

120
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,640
First, I have an announcement to make.

121
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,240
I'm now on the Free Software Foundation board of directors

122
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,680
once again.

123
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,320
We were working on a video to announce this with,

124
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,800
but that turned out to be difficult.

125
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,560
We didn't have experience doing that sort of thing,

126
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,600
so it didn't get finished.

127
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,360
But here's the announcement.

128
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,680
Some of you will be happy at this,

129
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,720
and some might be disappointed.

130
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,200
But who knows?

131
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,700
In any case, that's how it is.

132
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,040
And I'm not planning to resign a second time.

133
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,960
It was a while ago.

134
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,240
It was before the pandemic.

135
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,080
It was September 2019, just a few months after the world had

136
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,360
learned about the horrific sex trafficking operation run

137
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,880
by the influential billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.

138
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,360
Revelation after revelation had come out

139
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,680
about powerful people and influence,

140
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,640
and MIT got wrapped up in all of that.

141
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,040
Epstein had donated $850,000 to MIT's Media Lab.

142
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,960
He had visited the campus many times,

143
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,380
and of course, he had associated with several professors

144
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,360
and administrators there.

145
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,240
Now, RMS wasn't one of them, but an associate of Stallman's,

146
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,040
Marvin Minsky, who was an AI pioneer at MIT

147
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,560
and passed away in 2016, was involved with Epstein,

148
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,560
and allegedly in some very serious ways.

149
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,600
When that information became public in 2019,

150
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,880
it created quite an upset.

151
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,080
In response to that upset, protests were planned at MIT.

152
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,480
The organization of those protests was done over email,

153
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,920
and it was sent out to several email lists.

154
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,160
Richard Stallman was on one of those lists,

155
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,560
as you would imagine, since he had affiliations with MIT,

156
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,120
and he replied all.

157
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,640
And in a very typical Stallman fashion,

158
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,760
he took issue with how words were being used, specifically

159
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,640
the term sexual assault. And in a very insensitive

160
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,680
to the moment kind of way, went on a whole diatribe

161
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,160
and rant about the use of the term sexual assault.

162
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,720
That email thread made it into the hands of an MIT alumni,

163
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,720
who then forwarded that email to reporters.

164
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,160
But really, the reporters didn't do much with it.

165
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,160
So she then turned to Medium, and she

166
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,880
penned a post entitled, Remove Richard Stallman and Everyone

167
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,640
Else Horrible in Tech.

168
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,560
That post did get traction, specifically on social media,

169
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,920
and groups began digging into Stallman's past who were not

170
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,320
familiar with Richard Stallman.

171
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,520
They began unearthing lots of objectionable content

172
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,240
that you can find on his personal blog.

173
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,240
From there, with the connection to Epstein and the content

174
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,000
on his blog, things escalated very quickly,

175
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,440
and regular media outlets started

176
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,600
reporting on the incident.

177
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,520
The pressure grew on Richard Stallman and the FSF very fast.

178
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,880
So Stallman resigned from MIT and the Free Software

179
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,680
Foundation, which he founded in 1985,

180
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,560
a week after he sent that reply all.

181
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,440
And it's been since September 2019

182
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,680
that he sort of laid low.

183
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Did I make a prediction that he'd be back, Wes?

184
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,080
Was it this year that I predicted, or was it last year?

185
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,840
Yeah, I think you did.

186
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,360
We'll have to check the archives after the show.

187
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,760
But I don't know that any of us expected him really

188
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,680
to be gone forever, at least in all capacities.

189
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,960
Did you expect to be back on the board?

190
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,360
That I'm not sure about.

191
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,040
Yeah, it seems like this was supposed to be a splash,

192
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,400
but they kind of bamboozled the announcement video.

193
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
And so they just kind of casually

194
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,360
set it in a low-attended live stream.

195
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Is it possible there's hidden in here

196
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,440
is sort of a diss on free software video editors,

197
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,600
and that's why it was so hard to put that together?

198
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,560
Yeah.

199
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,960
This, for the FSF, is a key moment.

200
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,200
And there will be some that decide that they no longer feel

201
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,360
represented by the FSF.

202
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,680
And you may see some other organizations stand up.

203
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,040
I mean, it's been around since 85, so it has quite a history.

204
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,640
But that has to be, I think, in a sense,

205
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,600
it's going to be a social forking that's going to happen.

206
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Yeah, I mean, it seems like we're sort of evaluating here.

207
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,000
It's not really clear how this happened.

208
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,840
Yes, he's now listed on their website,

209
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
but there wasn't a lot of clear, at least at first,

210
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,640
sort of announcements around these changes.

211
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,120
And the way he says it in that video is sort of like,

212
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,840
you get the idea that there's some force of will being here.

213
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,600
He seemed to want to be back.

214
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,520
That wasn't said in a way that sounded like, well,

215
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,080
after discussing it with all the parties,

216
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,500
we've determined this is what's best for the Free Software

217
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,080
Foundation and the advocacy for free software.

218
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,280
And that's where it's tricky.

219
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,240
It's like, OK, we want to support free software.

220
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,040
We want to support these ideas.

221
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,240
But what does the Free Software Foundation do,

222
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,680
and who do they associate with?

223
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,640
What are their parties, and how do they advocate,

224
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,320
and does that match our goals?

225
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,560
And you kind of have to suspect and wonder

226
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,560
if this wasn't the plan all along.

227
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,480
You know, lay low, wait for the temperature to drop on this,

228
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,560
and then when we feel like it's safe to do so,

229
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,000
we'll bring you back to the board.

230
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,280
Perhaps.

231
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,240
I mean, how else do you get somebody as radical

232
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,560
as Richard Stallman to step aside

233
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,600
without some kind of, perhaps, compromise like that?

234
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,920
Regardless, he's back, and he has a renewed focus

235
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,780
on the problem of web apps.

236
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,720
And it seems the pandemic has made

237
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,000
him think more about this than he has in the past.

238
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,020
There used to be a few of these, but there are lots of them

239
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,520
now.

240
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,240
Government websites are inaccessible.

241
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,760
For instance, the House of Representatives website,

242
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,600
without running non-free JavaScript code,

243
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,720
you can't see a page, any page.

244
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,800
The WhiteHouse.gov interface doesn't

245
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,000
allow you to send a message.

246
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,600
Various Massachusetts websites don't work.

247
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,440
The websites to get vaccinated for COVID-19,

248
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,840
something that you should definitely do,

249
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,280
don't work without running non-free JavaScript code.

250
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,920
Fortunately, you can make appointments in some places

251
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,840
by phone, and that's what I did.

252
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,440
And I listen to this, and I think, boy,

253
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,880
this is a tough position.

254
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,080
If the bar is even all JavaScript has to be open

255
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,000
source, which understandably would be for him,

256
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,400
and I look at the direction and trend line things are going,

257
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,140
I don't think he has any influence in this.

258
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,640
I think his influence has waned.

259
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,440
He says we have to move away from web apps entirely.

260
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,040
I've been talking about web services and their web apps.

261
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,320
Well, one bad thing about them is how they depend

262
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,600
on running non-free software on your computer

263
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,360
and send it to you, and you have to know to stop it.

264
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,520
But they do other bad things, too.

265
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:47,280
For instance, web apps frequently spy on users,

266
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:54,160
mislead users, can sabotage users.

267
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,440
And so we need to move away from web apps.

268
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,680
If you depend on a web app, you're

269
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,080
depending on something that some organization can

270
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,440
change on you at any time.

271
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,640
It can sabotage it totally.

272
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,280
It can impose new conditions on you, anything at all.

273
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,640
So I call them online disservices,

274
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,720
because what they do to you is not, in my opinion, a service.

275
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,800
He's got a joke in there.

276
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,080
Pithy as always.

277
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,840
Yeah.

278
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,320
Doesn't it feel like, Wes, especially

279
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,720
after the work from home, school from home

280
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,320
year that we just had, that we are further away

281
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,160
from this than ever?

282
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,240
Web apps are more dominant and in use than ever right now.

283
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,920
Yeah.

284
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,200
And as ever, he's not wrong in spirit,

285
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,640
but it's just so far away from what the norm is.

286
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,200
And I think from pushing any of the compromises

287
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,120
that we're actually likely to see successful,

288
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,200
we need to think more about privacy and data

289
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,520
sovereignty and ownership.

290
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,440
And OK, maybe I do need to pay some proprietary service

291
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,200
over the network to do a job for me,

292
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,680
but how can I make sure that that's reasonably in my favor?

293
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,200
I'm not going to get to the point probably ever of being

294
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,480
able to dictate what someone I exchange data with over

295
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,240
the network runs on their side.

296
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,560
That's just part of the internet and the web, right?

297
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,720
We can't enforce that.

298
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,160
But if we can set up some better frameworks,

299
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,760
and it just doesn't feel like that's where his head is,

300
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
I mean, maybe we'll see if there's some interesting things.

301
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,320
He's certainly contributed a lot,

302
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,760
and I'm not proposing we erase Richard Stallman in any way.

303
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,680
It just doesn't seem like he's connected enough

304
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,600
to what's going on in actual popular culture

305
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,080
to be an effective advocate right now.

306
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,600
Right.

307
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,960
Manimek, there's a message here that is worth listening to,

308
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,640
but it's like we need a spokesperson or maybe

309
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,240
a group of spokespeople that are not as polarizing as RMS.

310
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah, I totally agree with what Wes just said.

311
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,960
And still, I think we need, even though his positions might

312
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,200
be a little bit extreme, we need some people like him

313
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,840
in the Linux new community.

314
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,120
We need this little talk in the background

315
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,760
that tells us, yeah, have a point on open source

316
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,080
and try to use software that is open source.

317
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,080
So I think he has his place in our community.

318
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,760
And we've all thought about this, about web apps.

319
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,040
Here I am on my full free software system,

320
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,240
and I'm connecting to a proprietary web app.

321
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,560
And I guess my comfort level with this

322
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,080
has always been as free as possible.

323
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,720
PyCrash points out you could GPL the JavaScript.

324
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,120
I mean, you could.

325
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,960
So that's an option.

326
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,640
But I live in a kind of a more reality-based situation

327
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,160
where I kind of feel like where I want to really focus

328
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,640
on free software is the core of my OS, what makes my computer

329
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,900
boot and function, how I access the hardware on my system.

330
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,560
I like that to be free.

331
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,920
Then I really like my user land to be as free as possible,

332
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,460
my desktop environment, my mail client, my web browser.

333
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,440
I all have preferences to use free software there.

334
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,040
Then there's like another layer, which

335
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,280
is like the nice-to-havities that I don't think

336
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,480
would destroy the computing experience if I couldn't

337
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,560
launch Slack or Steam.

338
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,640
And it'd be nice if they were open source,

339
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,800
but I want them to run on that free software stack, number

340
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
one.

341
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,180
And so the lower you go in the stack,

342
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,480
the more important in my mind it is to be free software.

343
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,760
And for some reason, that means websites

344
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,280
are kind of like at the top of that stack.

345
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,680
They're kind of like the furthest removed from me.

346
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,840
And I somehow have just gotten used to the fact

347
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,400
that these damn websites will just change on me.

348
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,760
And that's something he goes into more in his talk,

349
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,920
that these websites will just change.

350
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,280
The UI will read change, and you can't go back

351
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,520
to a previous version like you can with physical software.

352
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,860
But that's also just sort of the trend line of development.

353
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,320
And in some ways, it's a positive.

354
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,920
And it's just not a black and white issue.

355
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,920
And I think where RMS loses touch with the rest of us

356
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,400
these days is that he cannot connect

357
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,720
with that position at all.

358
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,320
And while you do need somebody who tugs at these ideals,

359
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,600
you have to do it in a way that doesn't seem so extreme

360
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,200
that it's unable to be processed.

361
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,480
And so I don't necessarily, I can't really

362
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,160
see this being a net benefit for the Free Software Foundation.

363
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,360
But time will tell, really.

364
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,080
We will see.

365
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,560
It's one of those stories where we can only just say,

366
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,080
we'll see what happens, sort of like the first time

367
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,600
back in September.

368
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,620
Well, let's move on, Wes.

369
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,780
Let's talk about something that's

370
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,320
coming a little bit down the road, something a little more

371
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,240
entertaining and exciting, perhaps something

372
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,120
you'll want to catch yourselves.

373
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,120
It's the Elementary Developer Weekend.

374
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,080
And Dan's here to tell us a little bit about it.

375
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,400
Dan, welcome back to the show.

376
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Hey, how's it going?

377
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,560
You know, pretty good, Dan.

378
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,520
You know, there's a lot going on these days.

379
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,640
But I'm feeling like it's time to talk about something else.

380
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:55,040
And you apparently wanted to have more work to do, Dan.

381
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,200
You know, I wake up every day, and I'm

382
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,280
like, I don't have enough things to do.

383
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,240
What more can I pile onto my plate?

384
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,400
Because if I'm not completely exhausted,

385
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,700
there's something else I could do.

386
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,200
Right, of course.

387
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,040
So you have the Developer Elementary Weekend

388
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,400
that you are announcing.

389
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,560
It's the very first of its kind.

390
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,320
And it feels like perhaps something

391
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,040
that in the past would have been considered as an in-person

392
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,540
event.

393
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,320
But with the current COVID situation,

394
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,440
it's a great opportunity to try something virtual

395
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,960
and see how it works, I imagine.

396
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,020
Yeah, absolutely.

397
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,600
And this is something we've been thinking about for a long time.

398
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,400
And we've always envisioned it as an in-person event.

399
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,720
But in-person events are really expensive.

400
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,760
And so there was kind of, like you said,

401
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,640
this opportunity to go, huh, well,

402
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,800
maybe we can try it online first and see what happens.

403
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,560
Yeah.

404
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,400
So what's the idea here?

405
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,940
It looks like there's a call for papers.

406
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,680
It's going now until April 20, and looking for ideas and talks.

407
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,560
What kind of stuff are you guys looking for?

408
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,400
Yeah, so kind of like the whole thing

409
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,840
is that we've been to a lot of different open source software

410
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,620
conferences.

411
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,920
And there's kind of like two big things.

412
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,480
There's either events that are really inclusive

413
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,720
and for everybody, but aren't necessarily technical,

414
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,800
or they're more like expo focused.

415
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,960
And then there's events that are very technical,

416
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,600
but they're usually like you see a lot of the same people there.

417
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,800
And they're people that are kind of already insiders

418
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,500
in the free software community.

419
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,960
And they're usually the people that

420
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
are making the platforms themselves,

421
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,680
like GNOME developers, and KDE developers, and stuff

422
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
like that.

423
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,480
So we want to really create an event that's

424
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,480
about app developers that are people that

425
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,840
aren't necessarily on the inside in these communities,

426
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,440
but that it's also a really technical event.

427
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,720
So we're asking for people to either submit ideas of things

428
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,800
they would like to see, or to submit talks

429
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,360
that they would like to give that

430
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,580
are focused around development and building applications.

431
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,580
And we want to create this really educational space where

432
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,920
we can help people be the best app developers they can be.

433
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,040
And that could lead to some great Linux desktop apps

434
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,760
one day.

435
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,560
So the website to check it out is edw.elementary.io.

436
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,760
And of course, we'll have a link in the show notes

437
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,520
where you can suggest an idea or submit a talk.

438
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,400
And rumor has it, perhaps, your humble host here

439
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,260
may be involved to some regard.

440
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,680
I don't know if we've really sorted out how much we'll

441
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
be on air or not.

442
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,880
But if nothing else, we're going to be here pushing buttons

443
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,000
to make it all happen.

444
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I like that it looks like submitting a talk

445
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,480
is done through GitHub.

446
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,280
This feels very open source.

447
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,640
Yeah, good idea, Dan.

448
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,700
Yeah, we've really been trying to stretch out

449
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,480
the new discussions feature in GitHub

450
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,120
and thought this was a really cool way

451
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,880
to do it because you can vote on subjects too.

452
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,000
And since it's a developer-focused thing,

453
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,500
people don't have to create an account

454
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,440
in some special presentation software.

455
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,240
They probably already have a GitHub account.

456
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,320
So we're trying to go where the developers are at.

457
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,080
Clever.

458
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,840
And I like that you've thought a lot about the format as well.

459
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,920
I know that's something that you and I talked a bit about off

460
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:55,360
air, but how to do it where the presentations are, well,

461
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,040
quite frankly, presentable and enjoyable to watch

462
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,400
and easy to understand and still have

463
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,840
the optional component of interacting

464
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,360
live with people and all of that.

465
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,860
So I think you guys have got a clever idea of how

466
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,960
to formulate it there that has taken a lot of the lessons

467
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,840
learned from the virtual events we've seen over 2020

468
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,120
and brought a lot of the best ideas together.

469
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,160
Yeah, I really hope so.

470
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,540
I mean, this is our first event, so not going down in flames

471
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,560
would be awesome, but also being able to do something really

472
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,860
useful and fun for the community would be cool.

473
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,400
I just want one day to just have the,

474
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,280
I want this to be successful so that one day we're

475
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,600
doing this in person.

476
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,120
We're drinking beers.

477
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,840
We're hanging out again.

478
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,960
It's like a full nerd event.

479
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,880
And so this is the first step, I think.

480
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,700
Yeah, and I think that's the best part about creating

481
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,840
these kind of conferences is like hallway conversations

482
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,840
and going out afterwards and really

483
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,760
that community and camaraderie and friendship.

484
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,140
So hopefully we can springboard from this

485
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,600
into a much larger in-person event.

486
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,240
Absolutely.

487
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,160
Well, Dan, thanks for joining us and telling us about it.

488
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,480
Yeah, thank you very much for giving me a space to.

489
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,960
And also here today on the show is Dalton from Ubuntu Touch,

490
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,080
and they just had a new release, OTA 16.

491
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,360
And Dalton joined us on Linux Action News

492
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,800
to go into some of the details and nitty gritties

493
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,340
about the release.

494
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,480
And it's looking like it's running pretty sharp

495
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,600
on the 3.8 Dalton.

496
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,640
Oh, you got it installed?

497
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,160
No, no, but I wouldn't YouTube spelunking.

498
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,040
So it turns out it's not Wes that has the 3.8,

499
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,500
so I wasn't able to take his phone and flash it.

500
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,680
Man, you got me so excited there.

501
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,560
And dang it, you still took my phone.

502
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
Yeah, well, I just wanted to wipe it.

503
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,400
There's reasons.

504
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,820
Let's just put it that way.

505
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,080
Also really cool that we are almost at the four-year mark

506
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,440
since this became an independent project.

507
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,040
Yeah, it's kind of crazy to think that.

508
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,280
April 5, 2021 is our four-year anniversary.

509
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,680
Man, does it feel like it's been four years,

510
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,080
or does it feel like it's been 10?

511
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,680
Both.

512
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,280
It's like having a kid, yeah.

513
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,320
It's interesting, because I know you guys have

514
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,520
been really super committed.

515
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,400
It feels like it's just been a four-year push, really.

516
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,080
But it kind of feels like it's coming together.

517
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,160
I mean, of course, there's a transition to 2004

518
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,520
on the horizon, but right now, it

519
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,640
looks like it's getting pretty solid.

520
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,600
The Pixel's out there.

521
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,140
The Vala phone's out there.

522
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,720
The 3a is a great phone.

523
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,040
A new Samsung phone just got support.

524
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,120
I mean, it's kind of all coming together right now.

525
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
It really does feel like that.

526
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,640
It just feels like we're in a really good, decent place

527
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,480
to work on the project and do things

528
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,800
that we think are fun in addition to things

529
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,760
that move the needle forward.

530
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,100
Well, you know, Dalton, something

531
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,820
we didn't touch on in the Linux action news chat

532
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,760
that maybe we should touch on here

533
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,840
is I didn't realize that in their effort at Vala phone

534
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,880
to support Ubuntu Touch, they have set up at least some people

535
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,760
in their offices that are supporting Ubuntu Touch

536
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,440
directly.

537
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,720
They're developing and working on Ubuntu Touch

538
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,120
now and getting paid by Vala, right?

539
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,040
That's correct.

540
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,640
Yes.

541
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,760
That seems like a big development.

542
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,640
Can you give me an idea of how long you expect that to be

543
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,280
and how big of an impact you expect that to make?

544
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,040
Ooh, how much can I say about?

545
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,200
Yeah, I understand it could be kind of tricky.

546
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,320
So what you are comfortable sharing is fine.

547
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,880
I feel like it's a long-term investment for them.

548
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,000
They feel like this is important to their platform as Vala

549
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,920
and to mobile use cases in general.

550
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,880
There is some other cool stuff coming up

551
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,880
that I don't know when it's going to come to fruition

552
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,280
and especially not in full light.

553
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,700
But I can just say it's really cool,

554
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,640
and I can't wait to talk about it.

555
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,120
And it'll probably be more reason

556
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,060
why they would need staff to support the OS,

557
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,800
I would imagine.

558
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,720
Yeah.

559
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,240
Yeah, OK, interesting.

560
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,620
That's really exciting, man.

561
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,200
I'm getting kind of like to the point

562
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,240
where I'm feeling kind of ashamed that I'm not running it

563
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,120
on a device currently.

564
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,160
Like that's the state it's gotten to.

565
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,560
It's like, oh, this is something I

566
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,760
need to start checking in on now.

567
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
Should I wait until the transition to 2004,

568
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,080
or should I just go for it?

569
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,840
I'd say just go for it.

570
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,600
Good answer.

571
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,760
Very good answer.

572
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,120
Well, Dalton, thanks for coming by and updating us.

573
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,320
Thanks for bringing me in.

574
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,720
It was good to chat with you.

575
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,480
Go check it out.

576
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,520
OTA 16 just came out last week.

577
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,560
And we will have a link to that in the show notes.

578
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,080
And more details about the release in this week's Linux

579
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,400
Action News.

580
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,880
Now, something that we don't have details about yet,

581
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,040
but I just want to let you know that if you are running

582
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,700
the security updates for any of the boxes,

583
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,200
if you're responsible for that, the OpenSSL project

584
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,860
is bracing us for a big update.

585
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,760
They are announcing an announcement.

586
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,360
And they're telling us that there

587
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,120
will be a new release of OpenSSL on Thursday the 25th of March

588
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,560
2021.

589
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,200
And they're even giving us a time range

590
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,200
between 1,300 and 1,700 UTC.

591
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,720
It's a security fix for a high severity issue.

592
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,400
You just don't see this very often, Wes.

593
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,880
No.

594
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,760
I guess we know exactly where our sysadmin friends are

595
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,420
going to be.

596
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:04,920
Yep.

597
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,280
Maybe it's a good time to rob them.

598
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,640
Wow.

599
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,440
Wow.

600
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,260
Yeah, because you know this is going to be really public,

601
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:11,560
right?

602
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,320
So this is one that people are really getting to jump on.

603
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,800
Yeah, we're going to try to get full coverage, a full breakdown

604
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,140
in Sunday's land, because we should have all

605
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,400
of the information by the time we're recording Linux Action

606
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:21,560
News.

607
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,020
We just don't know much right now.

608
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,480
We could speculate, but that just

609
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,040
wouldn't do anyone any good.

610
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,800
So we won't.

611
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,520
Linode.com slash unplugged.

612
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,120
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards your new account

613
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,000
and go there to support the show.

614
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,320
$100 means you can really try it out.

615
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,400
You can do a lot.

616
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,340
Linode is our cloud server provider.

617
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,720
And what we're about to tell you about just in a few moments

618
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,440
was done on Linode.

619
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,480
We always use Linode for these experiments,

620
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,720
because it's super quick to spin up a system.

621
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,960
It's really easy.

622
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,480
It's also really easy to clone them and back them up

623
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,000
and take snapshots.

624
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,520
And so within minutes, we'll get something up and running,

625
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,200
and we can take a risk.

626
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,880
We can take a risk of breaking something

627
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,280
that might destroy the networking,

628
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,000
and then we can't connect to it, because it's really easy

629
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,440
just to revert back.

630
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,840
So that kind of flexibility makes

631
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,200
it super easy for Wes and I to prototype ideas

632
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,340
for infrastructure, but also for show segments.

633
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,760
And I know that that would translate for your projects

634
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,280
as well.

635
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,440
And so I think that's something worth just using the $100

636
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,800
credit for right there.

637
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,280
But personally, one of the things

638
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,760
that I really like about Linode as a longtime Linux fan,

639
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,840
don't know if you knew that, but I've

640
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,360
liked Linux for a little while.

641
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,580
They really support just about all the Linuxes,

642
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,080
and even some of the ones you might not

643
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,120
want to run in the cloud.

644
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,160
But you got your reasons.

645
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,480
Even the Sooses, even the Sooses.

646
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,360
Actually, of course, the Sooses are up there.

647
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,280
They have a bunch of distributions they support.

648
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,480
I like that a lot.

649
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,800
But there's other features we play more with now

650
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,120
than I expected.

651
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,760
I'm always constantly finding new ways

652
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,720
to use object storage for back end storage for things that,

653
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,160
especially things that are shared between systems,

654
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,080
or when we need to send a segment to a sponsor

655
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,520
or an interviewee, we're using object storage for that now

656
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,100
too, because a lot of times, they're

657
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,560
bigger than what a lot of email server attachments support.

658
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,400
And so we just use the Linode command line tool

659
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,960
to pop it up on the object storage

660
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,080
and generate a public link.

661
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,280
It's fantastic.

662
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,360
It really is nice to just find ways to integrate it

663
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,920
into your workflow, because these tools are really good.

664
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,580
Some of the stuff we're about to talk about,

665
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,920
you could achieve with Linode's Cloud Firewall.

666
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,360
They started in 2003, and so they've

667
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,040
had time to really focus on how to do this right.

668
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
They haven't gone off and tried to create

669
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,000
every single different service under the sun

670
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,300
and do all this different stuff.

671
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,380
They've really focused in on what they're good at.

672
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,880
And over the years, they've built something really awesome.

673
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,320
In 2016, they took over control of their networking

674
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,200
and became their own ISP.

675
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,920
On some of their dedicated CPU rigs,

676
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,540
they have some really high-end AMD Epic CPUs

677
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,920
that are just crazy fast.

678
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,620
They have great disk I.O. They have fantastic network

679
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,280
connections, 40 gigabit connections

680
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,640
coming into the hypervisor.

681
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,840
They're dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud

682
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,320
computing.

683
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,760
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

684
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,840
But go try it yourself.

685
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,320
I mean, $100 really means you can actually try it.

686
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,320
So go over there and give it a go and support the show.

687
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,280
Linode.com slash unplugged.

688
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,880
We have some potential news for the Linux kernel.

689
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,440
And it's pretty exciting, Wes, because it involves

690
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,120
one of our favorite technologies.

691
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,880
Uh-oh.

692
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,520
I think I know what's coming next.

693
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,160
Initial support for the Rust language

694
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,440
has landed in Linux Next, which I assume you all are probably

695
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,920
just running it already.

696
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,640
But for a long time now, Linux kernel developers

697
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,040
have pondered the prospects of allowing the Rust language

698
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,040
to be used in kernel device drivers, kernel device

699
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,640
drivers, which could be a particular area of interest

700
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,720
for Rust and could potentially bring some of Rust's

701
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,520
best features like safety and performance to device drivers.

702
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,600
So announced just recently on the Rust for Linux mailing list

703
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,720
was word of initial Rust support hitting Linux Next.

704
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,120
Although, the announcement was quick to note

705
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,120
that this does not mean we'll make it into mainline,

706
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,000
of course.

707
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,120
But it's a nice step to make things as smooth as possible.

708
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,840
Of course, another issue with all this

709
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,240
is support is obviously conditional on having

710
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,840
a Rust compiler on the system that you're

711
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,760
building the kernel on.

712
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,520
That's a good point.

713
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,880
But really, if you think about it,

714
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,800
that's kind of a good place to start for this kind of thing.

715
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,280
Because you're going to have less platforms you're building

716
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,440
40 ways with device drivers.

717
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,160
They target fewer platforms to begin with.

718
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,640
So it kind of seems like there would be a lot of benefits

719
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,720
to drivers in Rust as well.

720
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,560
And it's not an area that's going to really break anything

721
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,160
major.

722
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,440
Right.

723
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,920
You're not like rewriting the whole kernel.

724
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,360
You're just saying, hey, I've got a new device.

725
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,960
This was going to be new code anyway.

726
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,720
Or maybe it's some old code that was never very good.

727
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,560
Let's see what it looks like in Rust.

728
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,240
While Rust is now in Linux Next, we should be clear.

729
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,560
It's not yet known if it's actually

730
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,840
going to get into mainline.

731
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,000
That depends on some stuff.

732
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,240
How does Linux Next bake?

733
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,560
Could stay in there for a while.

734
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,240
Could end up never getting merged.

735
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,920
But it's a step in the right direction.

736
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,400
And it seems like some of the kernel leaders, including

737
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,080
Linus, have some thoughts.

738
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,040
Yeah, that's true.

739
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,320
Greg KH has chimed in on the matter.

740
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,960
They all kind of have an air of skepticism,

741
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,320
as they probably should, regarding this issue,

742
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,720
I would imagine.

743
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,280
They've talked about this.

744
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,160
But they've kind of looked at it as, OK, we can give it a go.

745
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,200
Linus Torvalds says, personally, I'm in no way pushing for Rust.

746
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,000
But I'm open to considering it.

747
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,840
The promised advantages of avoiding some safety pitfalls

748
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,080
seem good.

749
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,360
But I also know that a lot of times, some of these promises

750
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,560
don't pan out.

751
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,720
Isn't that true?

752
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,280
The part that I like in this is just sort of getting support

753
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,200
for this, people not saying no, and letting people

754
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,280
hack on what that initial implementation looks like.

755
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,680
How does this play with the existing methods and data

756
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,680
structures that exist in the kernel?

757
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,440
Can people figure out some of that low-level integration

758
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,960
work, so that down the road, maybe we

759
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,400
can benefit from the pool of people that already know Rust

760
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,880
and want to contribute a device driver,

761
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
but really didn't want to do it in C?

762
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,520
There you go, Wes.

763
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,480
We knew eventually it would make its way.

764
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,040
Will it ever actually ship?

765
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,760
We will see.

766
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,040
But Rust is invading the kernel.

767
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:31,800
All right, let's tidy it up a little bit around here.

768
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,560
I want to let you know to keep an ear out

769
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,760
for episode 401 of your Linux talk show.

770
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,680
401, I chat with someone who ended up

771
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,920
building a Linux-powered bus to automate, to build, all of it.

772
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,000
He didn't know any of it.

773
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,720
He didn't know Linux.

774
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,120
He had to learn it all from scratch

775
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,560
at each step of the way.

776
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,440
And I sit down for a chat with him, and we discuss that.

777
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,360
And that is coming in episode 401,

778
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,000
which means we're taking 401 off.

779
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,240
Well, we're not taking it off.

780
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,440
But we won't be live, because it'll be prerecorded.

781
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,240
You know how that makes sense?

782
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,840
So if you're subscribed, you're going to get it.

783
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,960
Probably don't even need to mention it.

784
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,760
But I wanted to let you know that if you do

785
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,280
like to join us live on the 13th,

786
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,040
we will not be live as a result. But then

787
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,840
we'll be back to our regular bat time after that.

788
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,280
All of this is just easy to keep track of in our Telegram

789
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,320
group at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

790
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,480
So you can join that.

791
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,600
Maybe if you were going to join live,

792
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,560
use that time to figure out your mumble setup

793
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,880
if you haven't done that already.

794
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,360
Yep.

795
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,880
We have that link at linuxunplug.com.

796
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,680
This Sunday as we record, so coming up really soon,

797
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,520
I want to encourage you to join the LepLug.

798
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,200
Minimek, you have some details about a great Lug session

799
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,280
coming up this Sunday.

800
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:38,800
Yeah.

801
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,080
What I can say, LepLug is going strong.

802
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,920
And we will have another recording next Sunday.

803
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,680
And there will be the presentation of a tool

804
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,640
called Meerschaum.

805
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,680
So if you have seen the movie National Treasure,

806
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,960
you know what a Meerschaum pipe is.

807
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,480
So now I could try to tell you about that project.

808
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,080
But we have the developer of the tool right here in Mumble.

809
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,240
So Bennett, tell us what you will be talking about.

810
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,280
Thanks, Minimek.

811
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,640
And hey to all you sysadmins and Linux lovers out there.

812
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,720
So in the next LepLug this Sunday on March 28th,

813
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,880
check jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get

814
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,320
the time in your time zone.

815
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,520
I will be presenting a passion project of mine

816
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,000
called Meerschaum.

817
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,400
Meerschaum is an open source data management system

818
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,040
which makes getting your time series

819
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,040
data onto a dashboard as quick and easy as possible.

820
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,280
I'm always looking for feedback and user testing.

821
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,280
So if you'd like to help out, please

822
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,800
join us in the next LepLug.

823
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,320
You can read more about Meerschaum

824
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,920
at meerschaum.io or mrsm.io.

825
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,840
I hope to see you all next Sunday.

826
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,720
That's going to be great.

827
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,360
Like you said, the dates and time are on the calendar.

828
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,920
There's also a LepLug channel on our matrix

829
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,120
if you want to jump in there and start chatting.

830
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,760
All of the info, the mumble info, the matrix info,

831
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,200
it's all linuxunplug.com.

832
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,000
Just make it easy.

833
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,480
You just go over there, and you'll find it all.

834
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,520
And with that, that's all the tidying we have for this week.

835
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,920
So we wanted to share our favorite network trick with you

836
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,520
this week.

837
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,880
It's something that we've done in various iterations

838
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,000
over the last year to let the chat room come in live

839
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,600
and abuse a machine we have on our land.

840
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,080
I mean, obviously, I don't want to expose the studio's

841
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,440
public IP, but I want to give people an IP to connect to

842
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,880
so they can interact with what we're doing.

843
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,760
Some of you may also have a desire

844
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,560
to self-host something at home.

845
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,360
But perhaps your ISP blocks ports, or maybe like me,

846
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,840
you're behind some kind of crazy carrier-grade net.

847
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,560
There are ways to get around it.

848
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,960
And one way to get around it is a new service

849
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,040
that's launched called Hoppy.

850
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,520
And this is a way to do what we're about to tell you about,

851
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,600
but just do it real easy through their service.

852
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,080
And it's also one of the reasons that Wes and I have been

853
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,240
so keen to follow WireGuard, because we knew since we saw

854
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,320
the announcement that when it landed in Linux distributions

855
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,720
and made it into the kernel, it was

856
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,240
going to enable all kinds of network connectivity

857
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,640
fun, trickery, and solutions that we hadn't really

858
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,680
seen before, and make some older solutions that are still

859
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,280
viable, but make them seem a little obsolete.

860
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,960
And Hoppy is a good example of this.

861
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,560
Hoppy.network has created a business built

862
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,840
around WireGuard and Linux.

863
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,120
It's a service that lets you get a public IP on a machine

864
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,440
behind an ad, which is a big win for us self-hosters.

865
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,920
And I chatted with both the co-founders this morning

866
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,280
to get an idea of how it all works.

867
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,480
I chatted with Yoon.

868
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,720
My name is Yoon, or Yoon Sik Park.

869
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,360
And I am the co-founder of Hoppy Network.

870
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,280
And his other co-founder, Logan.

871
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,800
My name is Logan Collins, and I am a co-founder at Hoppy

872
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,520
Network.

873
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,000
And I asked them to give us the elevator pitch on what Hoppy is

874
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,120
so you guys could understand the value.

875
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:57,320
Hoppy is how you can lease a public IP address

876
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,040
and attach it to any device that you want.

877
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,200
It's a way of making a device public to the world

878
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,000
and bypassing any kind of inconvenient networking

879
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,520
situations that you might have.

880
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,680
It's a way of enabling you to self-host your own services

881
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,360
and take back a little bit of control

882
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,080
in the digital landscape that's been changing

883
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,440
over the last couple of years.

884
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,480
I like this idea.

885
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,120
I knew why Wes and I wanted to accomplish something like this.

886
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,120
So I asked them what was their motivation.

887
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,920
It kind of arose out of my self-hosting journey.

888
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,560
I was trying to decrease my reliance on iCloud specifically,

889
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,280
trying to self-host everything.

890
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,000
And the biggest roadblock was self-hosting a mail server.

891
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,320
And the reason is most ports are unblocked at home

892
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,560
except for SMTP or port 25.

893
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,840
And that's because this port specifically

894
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,600
is used to spam others.

895
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,560
And a lot of ISPs want to block that.

896
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,480
There wasn't a way I could really get around that

897
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,400
without putting my server into the cloud again.

898
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,640
And I thought, is there a way to get a IP address and unblock

899
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,720
ports within my own home?

900
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,200
And I was looking into different VPN services

901
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,560
that could accomplish that.

902
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,560
And there wasn't really anything like that.

903
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,240
And I spent a few months learning about networking.

904
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,920
And what I came up with was a prototype

905
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,080
of Hoppy Network that would actually accomplish that.

906
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,280
And like you probably are right now,

907
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,080
I was wondering, how does it work?

908
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,640
Each one of our servers, they use BGP

909
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,360
to get access to an IPv4 block as well as an IPv6 block.

910
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,840
But I'll just simplify it for now.

911
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,560
And that's slash 24 cents split up

912
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,440
across the different WireGuard clients.

913
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,000
So in our routing tables, we have each IP address routed

914
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,600
to the WireGuard interface.

915
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,840
So as long as you have that WireGuard interface connected

916
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,840
to us, we'll try to forward that IPv4

917
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,240
address over that interface.

918
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,720
And once your client receives that packet,

919
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,640
as long as your client is configured properly

920
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,520
to assign that IPv4 address to its own interface,

921
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,440
then it'll just accept IPv4 addresses

922
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,840
as if it was like a native system interface.

923
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,000
To use an analogy that is horrible,

924
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,560
but I still love using it, you can imagine these WireGuard

925
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,000
tunnels between our server and yours

926
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,520
as a giant ethernet cable that is just,

927
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,040
it's like you plugged in a new cable into your F0 port

928
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,880
or whatever, and you got assigned this public IP

929
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,000
to that network interface.

930
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,720
As far as your machine is concerned,

931
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,320
you have this public IP address, and we don't exist.

932
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,280
All the ports are open because the traffic for that IP

933
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,840
is coming directly to you.

934
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,760
So obviously, my next question was, well,

935
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,160
what about security, monitoring, those kinds of issues?

936
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,000
First of all, nobody can man in the middle of you

937
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,720
because the connected WireGuard is fully encrypted.

938
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,960
Between us and you, the traffic is encrypted,

939
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,360
nobody can view it, it's really great.

940
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,520
Between us and whatever client is connecting to you,

941
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,800
your IP is public, you should be using SSL or something.

942
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,840
We're not looking, we don't care what you're doing.

943
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,160
And we have a really good privacy policy,

944
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,040
it's less than a page long, anybody can read it,

945
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,880
it's something we adhere to.

946
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,320
I think Logan's saying there's not much we can do

947
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,520
other than promise that we won't spy.

948
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,960
And after we had wrapped up and I was saying goodbye to them,

949
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,440
they gave me another insight that wasn't prompted,

950
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,840
but it was just something that came up

951
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,440
while we were saying our goodbyes.

952
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,640
And I thought it showed that their hearts really were

953
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,280
in the right place with this project.

954
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,480
It's new, but I think their goals

955
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,360
align with what we'd like to see.

956
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,360
We hope that this service encourages people

957
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,440
to self-host more, it also encourages IPv6 adoption

958
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,720
because you get like a slash 56 as well.

959
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,840
Pretty much we want to make the internet a better place.

960
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,040
Yeah, and that's about it.

961
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,520
So cheers to them, thanks for coming on guys this morning

962
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,640
and chatting with me about it.

963
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,000
You can find it at hoppy.network.

964
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,600
And they've created a business around

965
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,240
making it really simple for you to get around NAT

966
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,440
using WireGuard.

967
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,120
You just connect to their WireGuard instance

968
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,960
they have hosted.

969
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,840
Now, of course, you could do this yourself too.

970
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,920
And so that's what Wes and I want to talk about today

971
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,560
is while we found Hoppy during kind of investigating

972
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,960
different ways to improve our solution for the studio,

973
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,840
we thought, you know, there's probably reasons

974
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,120
we could do this ourselves and would want to do this

975
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,080
for ourself and pondered how we could get around

976
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,840
my extreme double carrier grade mutant NAT

977
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,680
that I have at home and take advantage of that as well.

978
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,000
That thing, I mean, we've had to try a lot of solutions

979
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,680
and I think it's safe to say that your home networking

980
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,840
is not exactly simple at this point.

981
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:52,280
No, no, it's even crazier now that I aggregate two carriers.

982
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,040
Okay, yeah, let's put that aside just for a second here

983
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,840
because regardless, there are a lot of ways

984
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,040
to solve this problem.

985
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,240
Probably a lot that the audience is definitely

986
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,160
already familiar with, right?

987
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
You've got things like SSH forwarding,

988
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,120
that's super resilient.

989
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,160
You can do all kinds of fun tunneling,

990
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,320
take local ports and forward them,

991
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,040
take remote parts and forward them, all kinds of stuff.

992
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,840
Maybe you use a service like ngrok,

993
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,760
which I suppose focused perhaps more on developers

994
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,960
exposing HTTP services on the web

995
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,880
but does the same kind of NAT busting and NAT traversal

996
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,000
and forwarding you and putting you

997
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,200
on the public interface and proxying to you.

998
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,560
That's also another approach, right?

999
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,280
Like you could just use a VPN like WireGuard

1000
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,080
and then a reverse proxy setup on your cloud host

1001
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,960
like nginx or traffic if you've already got multiple sites

1002
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,760
or you're just familiar with how those work

1003
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,480
or you want it to do TLS termination for you anyway.

1004
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,840
But of course, this is Linux Unplugged.

1005
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,400
We started things off using WireGuard.

1006
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,560
We do love it.

1007
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,960
And part of why we love it is because it's like,

1008
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,600
it's just so integrated into Linux at this point, right?

1009
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,040
Especially now that it's merged into the kernel,

1010
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,800
it just makes it easy to play

1011
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,560
in whatever complicated networking setup

1012
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,880
you might already have like Chris

1013
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,280
or if you just wanna play with whatever tools are integrated

1014
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,680
that come installed on your Linux OS.

1015
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,800
Once you've got WireGuard,

1016
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,920
all the normal sort of IP and Linux networking tricks

1017
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,920
that you might have, those work just fine

1018
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,440
including what was maybe our first approach to this

1019
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,360
which is just forwarding ports with IP tables

1020
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,920
over that WireGuard connection.

1021
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,600
Yeah, and you know, it's not bad.

1022
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,120
We use that setup for a bit

1023
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,720
and this might be the one I would recommend for most people

1024
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,080
because it essentially becomes a cloud firewall.

1025
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,080
You allow certain ports like in our case, 80 and 443

1026
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,720
and only those ports.

1027
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,000
And so you're not sending every bot

1028
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,080
that wants to come knock on your SSH port

1029
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,440
over your connection to your home machine.

1030
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,320
You're blocking it there at the VPS level using IP tables.

1031
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,200
And so this is neat because you set up IP tables

1032
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,360
to forward those things down the WireGuard connection.

1033
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,480
It's a pretty simple straightforward connection.

1034
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,160
It can be done with literally

1035
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,120
just a couple of lines of IP tables rules.

1036
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,360
I mean, very simple.

1037
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,240
Yeah, I mean, I think our sort of proof of concept

1038
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,080
was two commands and that was it once WireGuard was set up.

1039
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,960
Yeah, and then you're just sending those two approved ports

1040
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,240
back to the machine,

1041
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,960
which I think is probably the ideal solution.

1042
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,920
But what if you wanted the entire machine,

1043
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,680
like maybe you wanted to expose a firewall

1044
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,480
that had a WireGuard connection on it

1045
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,920
and you wanted to then manage it at that firewall level.

1046
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,720
Right, or, you know, in this case, it's sort of,

1047
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,560
it's much like the just running a proxy on the box.

1048
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,280
You kind of have to manage both boxes, right?

1049
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,240
Like when you add a new service on your backend,

1050
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,920
you got to go tell the front end about it too

1051
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,120
and make sure that that's all working,

1052
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,120
it gets properly forwarded and allowed,

1053
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,480
which as you say, that can definitely be a good thing.

1054
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,840
And you should take security seriously.

1055
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,400
But sometimes you just want to say, you know,

1056
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,320
maybe you're not on a network where you could forward ports

1057
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,560
so you don't have full control.

1058
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,760
And you really just, as you're testing something out,

1059
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,280
you want to expose this machine, put it in the DMZ,

1060
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,880
get it right out there on the internet.

1061
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,760
And yeah, with WireGuard, you can do that too.

1062
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,400
Yeah, in fact, we have done just that.

1063
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,560
In your browsers right now, you can do it after the fact

1064
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,560
or while you're listening live, go to WireGuard.club.

1065
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,800
I should make sure this is still up.

1066
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,640
WireGuard.club in your web browser.

1067
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,440
And what you will get is a beautiful,

1068
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,520
extremely intricate website

1069
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,400
that I spent hours building just for you

1070
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,600
that is actually running on a VM on the machine

1071
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,160
I have right in front of me in the studio right now.

1072
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,000
I didn't know you knew web design.

1073
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,840
Look at that, right?

1074
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,320
It's pro work right there.

1075
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,480
Your connection will hop through a Linode,

1076
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,160
running WireGuard back to a VM on my machine.

1077
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,920
So the VM has the WireGuard client active,

1078
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,280
connected to the Linode,

1079
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,240
which is then routing all of the traffic down here.

1080
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,800
So how the heck did we do this, Wes?

1081
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,680
Oh boy, well, yeah, definitely WireGuard is involved.

1082
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,720
And so we were just talking about sort of the,

1083
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,520
maybe traditional port forwarding approach.

1084
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,800
And in that style,

1085
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,560
you basically just set up your WireGuard tunnel

1086
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,240
and you've assigned sort of private IPS behind there, right?

1087
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,080
So you can talk between them.

1088
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,480
And if you're just on local host there

1089
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,320
on your box in the cloud, your Linode, your VPS,

1090
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,280
you can go hit that private service.

1091
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,960
But you need iptables to both forward the ports on

1092
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,760
so that things from the internet can get there.

1093
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,080
But also because the whole WireGuard system,

1094
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,120
that's using private IPv4 addresses,

1095
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,120
you also have to introduce NAT.

1096
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,840
And sometimes you just don't want that.

1097
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,800
I mean, it works fine.

1098
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,560
Linux kernel is great at doing that.

1099
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,160
And iptables has no problems.

1100
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,600
It's easy to do and many people have done it.

1101
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,880
It's just not quite as flexible.

1102
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,720
Maybe you're trying to do

1103
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,520
a complicated WebRTC audio setup

1104
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,000
and you just don't want more levels of NAT involved.

1105
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,880
It turns out WireGuard makes this super easy.

1106
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,720
What we did on Linode in this case

1107
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,840
was get a second IP address and assign that to our Linode.

1108
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,560
They make that easy and tons of hosting providers do too.

1109
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,680
You just gotta get yourself a second IP address.

1110
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,440
You need one still to keep the host accessible.

1111
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,360
But that second one,

1112
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,480
much like you just assigned whatever arbitrary,

1113
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,480
say 10.200.200.1 address to your WireGuard network,

1114
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,480
to whatever machine you're connecting to on the backend,

1115
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,320
you can just put the public IP address there.

1116
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,240
And if you're using something like wg-quick,

1117
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,600
we'll have a link in the show notes

1118
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,480
that has sort of an example setup.

1119
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,040
That example is using IPv6,

1120
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,040
but works just the same for IPv4 pretty much in this case.

1121
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,600
And WireGuard figures that out.

1122
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,160
So on the backend side,

1123
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,520
the system running right at Chris's fingertips,

1124
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,960
right there in the studio, we just told it,

1125
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,200
hey, this is your IP address for WireGuard.

1126
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,320
This is gonna be the public IP address.

1127
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,520
And then on the server in the front end running in the cloud,

1128
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,760
you say the same thing like, hey,

1129
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,400
here's this WireGuard peer that's gonna connect to you.

1130
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,880
Here's the IP address that it's allowed to send from.

1131
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,680
And oh yeah, hey, in the reverse direction,

1132
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,080
we're just gonna send everything.

1133
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,760
So not only can you access all the ports

1134
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,920
on that hosting machine, but the hosting machine,

1135
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,080
all of its traffic is going at that IP address too.

1136
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,240
So on that machine, it really just feels like

1137
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,640
this is your new public IPv4 address

1138
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,280
right out there on the internet.

1139
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,680
That's exactly what it seems like.

1140
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:05,000
It's so slick and it's wherever you connect as a client from.

1141
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,080
You just established the WireGuard VPN

1142
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,400
and you could be mobile.

1143
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,640
You could be at a coffee shop, you could be at home,

1144
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,700
you could be wherever you connect from,

1145
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,040
it'll just send the traffic there.

1146
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,080
So it's really slick because I realized very quickly

1147
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,120
that this is kind of handy on my laptop

1148
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,180
because I could just turn it on briefly,

1149
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,600
send you the IP from wherever I was at

1150
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,560
and you could connect to my laptop

1151
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,240
that I was sitting at at that moment.

1152
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,080
And then when we were done,

1153
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,880
I could just disconnect WireGuard and it goes away.

1154
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,080
And that was super useful, but I also thought,

1155
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,240
boy, this could be handy for just home systems

1156
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,640
that I wanna turn on from time to time

1157
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,360
and get them exposed to the internet.

1158
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,120
I might prefer the style where you use IP tables

1159
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,040
to just forward certain ports,

1160
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,260
but routing all of the traffic has the advantage

1161
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,940
of just, it's like it's a node on the internet

1162
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,040
and then you manage it with whatever firewall you want.

1163
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:51,880
Exactly.

1164
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,280
I mean, how many times do you end up spinning up a VPS

1165
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,760
just because you know, like, okay,

1166
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,960
this isn't behind any of my stuff.

1167
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,560
I don't have to futz with this weird router UI

1168
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,420
or play with any of that.

1169
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,000
Like it's just gonna be on the internet.

1170
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,200
What I run there will be public.

1171
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,600
I don't have to think about it beyond that,

1172
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,680
which can be good or can be bad.

1173
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,240
And I should say, this is sort of how people view NAT

1174
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,000
is a sort of kind of firewall

1175
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,840
just because you have to do

1176
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,720
that network address translation step

1177
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,320
to actually get traffic to go both ways.

1178
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,280
All you really need to do

1179
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,960
if you want to have that same sort of stuff

1180
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,040
is just not forward everything by default,

1181
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,580
set up a deny by default firewall.

1182
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:28,360
We're using a Fedora 33 box in this case on the Linode.

1183
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,800
So you've got firewall D there or UFW,

1184
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,160
or in this case, actually, I disabled firewall D,

1185
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,320
gotta tell you that, and installed Firehole,

1186
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,240
which I just kind of like to use anyway,

1187
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,280
wrote up a quick config.

1188
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,120
I sent it to you, Chris.

1189
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,440
I mean, it's really, I don't know,

1190
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,120
20 lines long at most, right?

1191
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:42,960
Yeah.

1192
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,400
And you just say like, these are the services I want.

1193
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,360
You can allow all ports.

1194
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,000
You could block specific ports.

1195
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,200
Or in this case, we took the secure route,

1196
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,320
pretty much blocked everything except the services

1197
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,400
we knew we were running.

1198
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,160
Now, it does mean you still have to do that,

1199
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,320
but I think what's nice about this approach

1200
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,520
is you get the flexibility.

1201
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,880
You can forward everything if you want,

1202
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,880
or you can lock it down a bit more.

1203
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,660
Or if you didn't want to mess with IP tables at all,

1204
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,000
you could use like the cloud firewall

1205
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,060
that's probably built into whatever VPS provider

1206
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,820
you're doing, like we could do on Linode.

1207
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,800
Yeah, there's so many options.

1208
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,720
And then ultimately, the even simpler route

1209
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,680
would be something like hoppy.network,

1210
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,720
where you just sign up,

1211
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,840
I think they're using Stripe for the billing or something,

1212
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,440
and then you provision a box after you pick.

1213
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,680
They have like an $8 a month and an $11 a month.

1214
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,200
And it's like the difference between one terabyte

1215
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,780
or two terabyte of transfer.

1216
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,780
I signed up a little bit just to try it out.

1217
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,840
And what you have to do as an end user

1218
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,040
is download a WireGuard comp,

1219
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,780
and then just do a WG quick up the name of that comp,

1220
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,460
if you put it in Etsy WireGuard, and you're connected.

1221
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,320
So it's really just a matter of starting

1222
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,240
the WireGuard client and connecting

1223
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,780
if you want to use Hoppy.

1224
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,920
But the VPS side of stuff,

1225
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,260
like what we built up on Linode

1226
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,680
with IP tables and WireGuard,

1227
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,660
it's good entry level stuff.

1228
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,100
If you've been looking for a reason

1229
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,720
to learn a little bit about networking

1230
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,580
and a little bit about different firewall options on Linux,

1231
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,700
and you want to do something that could also mean

1232
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,000
maybe you could access a home system from time to time,

1233
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,280
this is a really nice setup.

1234
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,480
And of course, we got you hooked up

1235
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,620
with links in the show notes,

1236
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,160
where you can go through some of the steps

1237
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,060
and figure out how to do this.

1238
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,520
And you can always go check out Hoppy

1239
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,480
and see how they're doing it,

1240
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,240
and get an idea and a feel for it,

1241
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,760
and then go build this yourself,

1242
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,720
because even if you really have never done

1243
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,620
any of this before,

1244
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:24,320
with a few hours of work and reading,

1245
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,760
you could have this set up

1246
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,100
and get it running yourself.

1247
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,900
I think it's a fun way for us to expose the system,

1248
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,400
and I'm looking at the resources right now.

1249
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,320
It's actually, I got to say,

1250
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,840
I'm running in KVM, Vert Manager,

1251
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,920
and it does a good job of distributing the load.

1252
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,480
My memory usage is going up quite a bit right now

1253
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,280
on the system at WireGuard.club,

1254
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,680
but the CPU load's getting spread out pretty good.

1255
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,520
Yeah, maybe we should talk,

1256
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,120
I mean, all right, we were harping on

1257
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,680
about the cool aspects of the Linux networking stack,

1258
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,700
which we should, because it's awesome.

1259
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,060
But you're also running the Linux-powered virtual machine,

1260
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:01,980
and you're even running a kind of interesting

1261
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,920
Linux distribution inside that virtual machine

1262
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,000
to power the website.

1263
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,200
Yeah, this was an opportunity for us

1264
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,120
to play again with Turnkey Linux,

1265
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,040
which I wanted just a quick VM that ran WordPress.

1266
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,120
I didn't want to spend many hours building a website.

1267
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,000
I was joking earlier, obviously.

1268
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,800
And so we grabbed the Turnkey WordPress installation,

1269
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,880
and it really is a pretty good experience.

1270
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,720
It didn't take any fuss to get it up and running,

1271
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,680
and it had a decent WordPress site ready to go.

1272
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,200
It has integration with Let's Encrypt,

1273
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,860
if you want to go that route, makes that really simple.

1274
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:30,700
I was impressed.

1275
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,400
It'd been a while since I'd visited Turnkey Linux land.

1276
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,200
And what's also great, Wes,

1277
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,940
is none of this is really new hardware.

1278
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,980
These are like 2017 machines,

1279
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:40,960
and we've got a couple hundred people

1280
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,040
knocking on the door right now,

1281
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,080
and it's doing a pretty good job.

1282
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,320
Man, I'm still using the machine

1283
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,760
to read the show notes and whatnot.

1284
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,320
Yeah, that was gonna be my main concern.

1285
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,360
Gonna break the show.

1286
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,960
Yeah, I know, because this one, it really matters.

1287
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,920
This one, it really does.

1288
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,440
But man, this is a lot of fun.

1289
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,360
It's one of our favorite things

1290
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,600
to do with WireGuard right now,

1291
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,960
and we'll have links to that in the show notes.

1292
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,500
And we'd love to hear how you do these kinds of things,

1293
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,600
because there's lots of ways to solve this problem,

1294
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,280
and probably some of them are pretty interesting.

1295
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,920
Linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

1296
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,120
Unpluggedcore.com, if you'd like to become

1297
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,840
a member of this show, support the show.

1298
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,520
Not only does it keep the show independent

1299
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,880
and keep us going,

1300
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,760
and helps us cover the cost of production,

1301
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,820
but as a thank you, you get a couple of perks.

1302
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,120
You get two different feeds.

1303
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,280
Well, you could really listen to both,

1304
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,400
but then you'd probably have time for nothing else.

1305
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,240
So I don't recommend it.

1306
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,440
So you must choose between door one and door two.

1307
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,420
Door one is a limited ad version of the show.

1308
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,200
Same full production, just no ads.

1309
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:44,600
Door two is the full live stream feed,

1310
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,600
which I have no idea what condition it's gonna be in today,

1311
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,080
because OBS crashed on us, it was a mess.

1312
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:53,040
So I have no idea, but it's everything, it's raw.

1313
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,940
It's like every time my mouth didn't work today,

1314
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,880
or when Wes dropped an F-bomb, it's in there.

1315
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,200
It sure is.

1316
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,520
The topics we talk about before and after the show

1317
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,120
that don't make it into the recording at all,

1318
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,400
because we hit stop, and then everybody opens up

1319
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,960
and talks about everything, that's in there too.

1320
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,780
We got you, suckers, ha!

1321
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,840
Well, for the most part.

1322
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,580
I suppose, you know, there's really no real replacement

1323
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:19,240
for really being here live, let's be honest.

1324
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,440
But that's what's in feed two,

1325
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,040
is like as much as we can pack in there.

1326
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,440
It's a whole show, pre and post show.

1327
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,720
It's basically a whole extra show that never gets released,

1328
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,760
because a lot of it's tech and Linux and open source topics

1329
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,280
that we're talking about.

1330
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,840
And sometimes that stuff actually does become a topic too

1331
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,660
in the show.

1332
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,000
So it's a way to feel like you've been here,

1333
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,560
like you experienced the whole thing.

1334
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,120
So that's feed number two.

1335
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,880
And all of that, door one, door two,

1336
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,880
is at unpluggedcore.com,

1337
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,740
and you can become an Unplugged Core contributor.

1338
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,040
And thank you to our members who support the show.

1339
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,840
What do you say we do a pick, Wes?

1340
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,320
Ooh, it's been a while.

1341
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,560
Yeah, it's been a week, maybe two?

1342
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,680
Don't know.

1343
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:00,080
But it's been a while since we've had on theme picks

1344
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,140
that match what we talked about in the show,

1345
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,300
that's for sure.

1346
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,920
And DSNET is one of them.

1347
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,080
And Wes, I have a feeling it's WireGuard related.

1348
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,680
Oh, yes it is.

1349
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,000
DSNET is a simple configuration tool

1350
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,520
to manage a centralized WireGuard VPN.

1351
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,540
Think WG Quick, but quicker.

1352
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,860
And really the context here is,

1353
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,200
all right, so the box we were testing,

1354
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,040
that was running on KVM on one of the studio machines.

1355
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,080
While I was setting things up

1356
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,040
and playing around last night,

1357
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,400
going in and setting up Let's Encrypt,

1358
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,920
even though I didn't realize that turnkey

1359
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,800
already had to integrate it.

1360
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,200
So I hacked it on additionally, dang it.

1361
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,080
But I did that over a VPN connection,

1362
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,880
a WireGuard VPN connection from my house, right?

1363
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,720
And how do we manage that?

1364
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,920
We've got multiple people with access to the studio,

1365
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,240
remote setups, Chris, you just lose your keys all the time

1366
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,340
and constantly have to add new ones

1367
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,880
when you buy a new laptop to play with.

1368
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,240
We're currently using Subspace for that,

1369
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,600
which is a neat, gooey, web gooey project

1370
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,960
that we talked about, I think, last summer or so.

1371
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,520
Unfortunately, it doesn't really seem

1372
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,640
to have been updated since then.

1373
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:02,760
And it was a little more than we needed.

1374
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,600
It had its own custom database and going in

1375
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,800
and working around some of the lack of features

1376
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,240
meant I had to go into the container,

1377
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,440
restart things, disable it, really customize it

1378
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,080
more than I was looking for.

1379
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,900
And we're not managing a whole organization,

1380
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,960
but we do have a centralized WireGuard VPN.

1381
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,960
And we do want a way to record a name and description

1382
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,200
about every peer we're allowing

1383
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,380
and a way to add peers as fast as possible.

1384
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,520
For one of us sets up a new machine,

1385
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,920
we just want to be able to go in there,

1386
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,520
add it real quick, give the key out

1387
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,040
to whoever's being added and be done with it.

1388
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,720
And that's where DSNet comes in.

1389
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,560
Yeah, it's slick.

1390
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,600
I think we're gonna switch to this.

1391
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,080
I think it's what we're gonna use, don't you think?

1392
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,000
Yeah, I think so.

1393
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,400
I mean, I've only just tried it out a little bit.

1394
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,800
We'll have to try it in practice for real

1395
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,320
and see if it holds up after adding a couple folks

1396
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,600
or redoing, modifying keys.

1397
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,080
That's my main concern.

1398
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,600
But it's kind of just enough.

1399
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,440
It's simple.

1400
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,440
It doesn't have a gooey.

1401
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,600
It doesn't try to reinvent things.

1402
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,480
It's just a nice little shell interface

1403
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,600
that you can run on the command line

1404
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,880
and get your stuff done.

1405
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,160
And we have a spot of feedback this week.

1406
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,080
This one's a special one because the author

1407
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,560
is in the mumble room.

1408
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,920
But Wes, why don't you read the highlights of it

1409
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,040
and then we'll engage with Bennett.

1410
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:11,880
Sure.

1411
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,960
Bennett wrote in to us,

1412
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,320
hi, Chris, Wes, and the LUP crew.

1413
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,520
I just ran across this on the Linux subreddit.

1414
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,360
This engineer has been building a modular ecosystem

1415
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,360
for the Raspberry Pi Compute Module

1416
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,360
over the last several months.

1417
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,320
And it's nothing short of magic.

1418
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,400
Think phone blocks, Project Aura for the Raspberry Pi.

1419
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,360
I'm talking hot swappable blocks for cameras,

1420
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:38,320
ethernet speakers, and even things like GPS and LoRa.

1421
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,240
And here's a demo video

1422
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,400
which we'll have linked in the show note.

1423
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,080
The project's homepage is pocket.ai.

1424
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,680
Now, I know how much Chris loves his pies.

1425
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:52,280
So I thought it'd be a good pick for the show.

1426
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,600
Regards, Bennett.

1427
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,520
And boy, Bennett, were you right.

1428
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,040
Yeah, Bennett, thanks for writing

1429
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,720
and thanks for joining us in the LUP blog this week.

1430
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,560
Now, what do you think?

1431
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,160
Is it real?

1432
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,480
I feel like we've had this promise so many times.

1433
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,000
So I just came across it yesterday

1434
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,560
and to me it seemed like the holy grail of mobile computing.

1435
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,720
Google couldn't accomplish this with Project Aura.

1436
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,840
Phone blocks seemed like a pipe dream.

1437
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,960
And yet this single developer

1438
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,280
casually put up this video on the subreddit.

1439
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,760
And as I was watching it,

1440
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,880
the amount of disbelief kept rising

1441
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,440
as he kept showing more and more crazy modules.

1442
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,000
Yeah, it seems like there's a real big community

1443
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,760
of builders and makers

1444
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,000
that are using the Raspberry Pi 4 compute module

1445
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
to build out even more fancier systems.

1446
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,600
On this week's episode of Self-Hosted,

1447
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,720
which by the way,

1448
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,640
if anything we talked about today interested you at all,

1449
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,080
check out selfhosted.show.

1450
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,720
But on this week's episode of Self-Hosted,

1451
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:55,600
we interview a YouTuber who set up 16 SATA disks

1452
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,400
to a Raspberry Pi compute module.

1453
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,120
16 SATA disks.

1454
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,400
It's all kinds of stuff they're building around that.

1455
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,480
And I wonder if maybe it takes something

1456
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,480
like a popular platform like the Raspberry Pi

1457
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,720
to make the modules a actual sustainable business

1458
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,120
because there has to be enough users

1459
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,160
that could actually buy them

1460
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,560
to make manufacturing them viable.

1461
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,640
And it looks like on the post that I sent in the email,

1462
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,760
so many people were interested

1463
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,040
and it seems like the developer might be selling test kits

1464
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,000
in the coming months.

1465
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,400
Now, hardware, hmm, that changes things.

1466
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,560
Yeah, that would be interesting to see.

1467
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,960
So that is at pocket.ai, right?

1468
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,400
P-O-C-K-I-T.ai.

1469
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,840
We will put a link to that in the show notes.

1470
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,000
It does look really cool.

1471
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,440
I can't help but have my really big skeptical pants on

1472
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,040
for this kind of stuff these days.

1473
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,120
But boy, would I love to see it.

1474
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,520
Boy, would I love to.

1475
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,880
That would be great.

1476
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,560
Well, Bennett, thanks for sending that in.

1477
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,400
If you'd like to give us an email here on the show,

1478
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,240
something for us to read,

1479
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,560
something to make, that I can make Wes read, at least.

1480
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,160
At least one email so I can make Wes read it

1481
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,920
at linuxonplug.com slash contact.

1482
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,160
I don't know, Wes.

1483
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,080
I don't know, I guess I just felt like trolling, I guess.

1484
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,480
I mean, I need a challenge, I acknowledge that.

1485
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,680
All right, well, if anything we talked about today

1486
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,920
interested you, like I said, check out the self-hosted show.

1487
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,000
We talk about this stuff every other week.

1488
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,920
If you do the Twitter thing,

1489
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,280
you can follow this show at Linux Unplugged.

1490
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,960
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

1491
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,520
And there is an entire network of fantastic podcasts,

1492
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:29,440
which can be found at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1493
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,960
And if you're interested in the updates

1494
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:31,920
for the Ubuntu Touch Project,

1495
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,800
be sure to check out Linux Action News.

1496
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,360
And of course, we'll have the open SSL news in there as well.

1497
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,560
As of for this year's show,

1498
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,640
we'll be back at the same bat time.

1499
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,920
See you next week.

1500
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,560
Same bat time, same bat station.

1501
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,480
Oh yes, because the Linux does roll on.

1502
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,880
Make it a whole Linux Tuesday.

1503
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:54,080
Join us live, 12 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

1504
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,600
Links to everything we talked about today,

1505
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,720
how to contact us, the mumble room, the matrix info,

1506
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:03,600
how to even subscribe, all of it, all of it.

1507
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,720
It's at linuxunplugged.com.

1508
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,240
What a great idea.

1509
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,760
A website, Linux Unplugged, it doesn't have to be an app.

1510
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,480
It could be a website.

1511
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,400
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

1512
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,080
of the Unplugged program.

1513
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,360
And we will see you right back here.

1514
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,360
Not on Sunday, not on Monday.

1515
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,880
Nope, not Thursday.

1516
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,760
You guessed it.

1517
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,720
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1518
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,200
Hey.

1519
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:50,320
Hey.

1520
00:59:50,320 --> 01:00:05,360
All right, there was some bot shenanigans, so go to JBtitles.com and let's figure this

1521
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,360
out.

1522
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,360
Let's title this thing.

1523
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,480
Someone didn't start the show.

1524
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,960
I don't know who that could have been.

1525
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,440
Some sort of shenanigans.

1526
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,440
JBot!

1527
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,600
Happy Gnome 40 week, everybody.

1528
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:18,280
By the time most people are listening to this, I think if all things go as planned, Gnome

1529
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,600
Shell 40 will have landed.

1530
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,200
Of course, most people won't get in their distro yet for a bit.

1531
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,600
But there is a Fedora 34 beta out too, right?

1532
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,600
Yep.

1533
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:31,880
I already approved it to land for this evening's update sync for Fedora 34.

1534
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:37,360
So if you've installed the Fedora 34 beta ISO and then do an update from Gnome software

1535
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,360
or using DNF, you will get it.

1536
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,360
You hear that, Chris?

1537
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:54,520
Switch the studio tonight.
