00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 30 for March 4th, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:41.700
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that knows this call is being monitored.

00:41.700 --> 00:42.900
My name is Chris.

00:42.900 --> 00:43.900
My name is Matt.

00:43.900 --> 00:44.900
Hey there, Matt.

00:44.900 --> 00:46.240
We've got a great show coming up this week.

00:46.240 --> 00:49.800
So last week, in episode 29, we talked about ourselves a lot.

00:49.800 --> 00:57.080
We talked about the new How To Linux show, and oh my gosh, we got like 40 to 50 emails

00:57.080 --> 00:58.920
just on that topic alone.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.560
It's blowing my mind, and everybody has a great idea.

01:01.560 --> 01:05.720
So many really good ones, but I just thought like we couldn't go through that again because

01:05.720 --> 01:10.960
this week, I want to help somebody troubleshoot some battery life problems with their laptop.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.840
They've been running Arch for a long time.

01:12.840 --> 01:17.520
They switched to OpenSUSE, and all of a sudden, way better battery life, and they're trying

01:17.520 --> 01:20.800
to figure out why that might be, so we'll kick that topic around with our mumble room,

01:20.800 --> 01:24.560
and I know you've got some battery tips that you might be able to pass along, and later

01:24.560 --> 01:28.640
in the show, we're going to chat with some of the developers from the Talks Project.

01:28.640 --> 01:33.920
Now Talks is a new up-and-coming open source project to essentially replace Skype, to have

01:33.920 --> 01:38.040
a secure peer-to-peer Skype replacement, and there's a lot of secure messaging programs

01:38.040 --> 01:42.920
that are coming online in 2014, obviously as a reaction to the leaks from Edward Snowden,

01:42.920 --> 01:47.080
and I think it's going to be really fascinating to watch these as they develop, and particularly

01:47.080 --> 01:51.680
because of my focus on the desktop, I've been drawn to ones that are starting with a desktop

01:51.680 --> 01:52.680
application.

01:52.680 --> 01:57.240
A lot of the ones you're seeing kind of come out of the response to Edward Snowden are

01:57.240 --> 02:01.120
mobile applications, which is fine, I want to see a mobile app too, but I'd also really

02:01.120 --> 02:05.120
like to have a desktop component, and Talks is starting there, so we're going to talk

02:05.120 --> 02:10.360
with them in a little bit, and ask some questions that our audience has submitted in, and then

02:10.360 --> 02:13.520
we've got some mail sack we're going to get to towards the end of the show too, so big

02:13.520 --> 02:15.320
show today, Matt, big show.

02:15.320 --> 02:18.600
It might be a really kind of tight show, depending on how long, it could be like a big show in

02:18.600 --> 02:22.760
terms of what we talk about, but a shorter show in terms of length, you never know.

02:22.760 --> 02:25.120
I shouldn't say that though, it probably would curse us.

02:25.120 --> 02:28.980
So let's start with a topic that I wanted to bounce around.

02:28.980 --> 02:35.760
This is a problem that Gagero wrote in about, he says OpenSUSE has better battery life than

02:35.760 --> 02:38.800
Arch on the same rig, can you guys help me figure this out?

02:38.800 --> 02:42.600
And he starts out with, you know, he says, hey guys, I'm in love with my Arch Linux install,

02:42.600 --> 02:46.840
well actually it was Integros, have you made the switch with you guys during the Arch challenge?

02:46.840 --> 02:50.740
But I recently gave OpenSUSE a spin, and while it has some things I really like, I'm ready

02:50.740 --> 02:52.640
to switch back to my Arch install.

02:52.640 --> 02:57.200
However, I'm finding it very difficult for one reason, battery life.

02:57.200 --> 03:01.540
Even with similar power management rules, running KD on both distros, the battery life

03:01.540 --> 03:04.560
on OpenSUSE has been insanely better.

03:04.560 --> 03:08.480
The trade seems to be that OpenSUSE is a lot slower.

03:08.480 --> 03:12.120
I can't figure out what the actual difference really is though, I've been digging in the

03:12.120 --> 03:17.480
Arch Wiki for suggestions, but with school in full swing, I've been unable to find time

03:17.480 --> 03:21.680
to figure out a solution, and I've grown very comfortable with not having to hunt for outlets

03:21.680 --> 03:24.640
everywhere I go.

03:24.640 --> 03:28.640
As I've said, aside from auto-dimming the screen and auto-suspend settings, I can't

03:28.640 --> 03:32.760
really figure out where OpenSUSE is getting the dramatically better battery life, but

03:32.760 --> 03:38.240
Arch has proven to make my lap be very power-thirsty over multiple installations, even with an

03:38.240 --> 03:40.000
Arch proper installation.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Your loyal JBViewer, Don Gerro.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.240
Well, so my experience between the two distributions is it seems like OpenSUSE definitely has some

03:47.240 --> 03:49.960
moderate configuration stuff done for you.

03:49.960 --> 03:53.440
I wouldn't go so far as to say they did laptop mode tools or something like that, but they

03:53.440 --> 03:55.200
definitely have something going on.

03:55.200 --> 03:58.740
On the Arch side of the fence, laptop mode tools will do you no good because it's a completely

03:58.740 --> 04:02.240
different kind of setup, and out of the box, it's not designed to give you any power savings,

04:02.240 --> 04:04.000
it's designed to just run.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.400
If you go to the Arch Wiki and go to the power savings portion of it, all the tips you need

04:09.400 --> 04:15.320
for a laptop are in there, and if you enable every single thing, including down from UDev

04:15.320 --> 04:19.400
all the way up to the kernel modules and whatnot, and actually look at all those different things,

04:19.400 --> 04:25.120
enable them, write back mode, the whole package, you will indeed see significant improvement.

04:25.120 --> 04:30.840
This concept of battery life being different between distros is interesting to me, because

04:30.840 --> 04:37.040
aside from driver versions and kernel versions, it seems like things should be pretty normalized,

04:37.040 --> 04:40.680
and I've always found the newer kernels recently have provided better battery life.

04:40.680 --> 04:46.220
Early three kernels had power regressions, but I've always noticed that when I've upgraded

04:46.220 --> 04:52.600
my kernel to the latest kernel, I've usually seen an improvement in some component that

04:52.600 --> 04:56.440
results in some better battery life, like maybe it's better support for the Intel graphics,

04:56.440 --> 05:00.680
or maybe it's a better Wi-Fi driver and that results in less broadcast usage, or whatever

05:00.680 --> 05:03.760
it is, it always seems like the newer kernel has always been what solves it.

05:03.760 --> 05:08.560
I've never really specifically tested this thing, you know, like put Ubuntu on a machine,

05:08.560 --> 05:11.560
put SUSE on a machine, and then put Arch on a machine and timed the difference.

05:11.560 --> 05:16.440
So, basically, my experiences are based on, if I install PowerTop and I run it on a default

05:16.440 --> 05:20.160
Arch installation, you're going to be, and you go over to tunables, it's just bad up

05:20.160 --> 05:21.160
and down.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.160
That's just what you're going to see.

05:22.160 --> 05:23.680
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

05:23.680 --> 05:26.600
What you want to see is lots of good, and if you want to do that, that's why I would

05:26.600 --> 05:31.480
actually recommend the power savings section for that, because now on OpenSUSE, I recall

05:31.480 --> 05:33.400
there was some bad, some good.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.560
Now I noticed there was more good enabled in PowerTop than there was.

05:36.560 --> 05:40.520
Oh yeah, PowerTop's a great tool, maybe you should run PowerTop on both installations,

05:40.520 --> 05:44.840
so you guys have any ideas on what he could check to see why OpenSUSE is getting such

05:44.840 --> 05:46.240
better battery life than Arch?

05:46.240 --> 05:51.720
Yes, try CPU power, because I noticed CPU power behaves pretty good with system D.

05:51.720 --> 05:55.080
Yeah, you think maybe there's like a moderator set?

05:55.080 --> 06:01.760
I'm pretty sure, because I know in the kernel, Arch has performance mode enabled by default

06:01.760 --> 06:02.760
too.

06:02.760 --> 06:03.760
That's right.

06:03.760 --> 06:04.760
Oh, interesting.

06:04.760 --> 06:12.240
Yeah, so if you modify the on-demand driver for CPU power, whatever it's called, it'll

06:12.240 --> 06:13.800
be pretty good after that.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.680
Yeah, CPU freq's another thing to check to see if maybe…

06:16.680 --> 06:20.280
Actually, CPU freq is not so good, so I think that's been depreciated.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.920
Well, isn't CPU freq not just a tool to read what your current frequency is?

06:23.920 --> 06:29.200
Because I'm wondering if maybe there is more aggressive frequency scaling maybe under OpenSUSE.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.200
Probably.

06:30.200 --> 06:34.840
Yeah, there's a number, I've never really driven too deep into OpenSUSE specifically,

06:34.840 --> 06:36.800
but I do know that they have some stuff enabled by default.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.640
I'd like to play with this some more, I think.

06:38.640 --> 06:39.960
I think I would like to try this out.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.260
I think this would be an interesting, this almost could be an interesting roundup.

06:43.260 --> 06:45.560
Is there the ultimate battery saving distro?

06:45.560 --> 06:52.600
Because you know, on Sunday I'm going to review this C720 Chromebook here, and I can't

06:52.600 --> 06:53.600
even…

06:53.600 --> 06:56.320
Oh, you will not want to do it without using the power saving portion.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.320
No, I can't.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.320
Oh, you know what's crazy?

06:58.320 --> 06:59.320
It'd be painful to use otherwise.

06:59.320 --> 07:04.520
No, it's not, I mean, so I think I could get maybe another hour, I don't know, I

07:04.520 --> 07:05.520
should try it to be honest.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.840
I will try it before the review.

07:06.840 --> 07:10.800
Yeah, I mean on my netbook I can squeeze like an hour and a half to two hours difference.

07:10.800 --> 07:11.800
Really?

07:11.800 --> 07:14.440
Oh yeah, I mean it's a big deal, but you got to go through every single thing on that

07:14.440 --> 07:15.440
power saving area.

07:15.440 --> 07:19.080
Okay, so CPU freq was renamed to CPU power.

07:19.080 --> 07:23.440
So I'm getting like, I don't know, I'm going to time it for the actual review right

07:23.440 --> 07:27.960
now, but I think I'm getting like seven hours of battery life with the C720 running

07:27.960 --> 07:28.960
arch.

07:28.960 --> 07:32.680
So I'm going to, I'll install, I'll go through that arch wiki that you mentioned

07:32.680 --> 07:36.320
and I'll dig through that and see if I had to do some of those tweaks if I can even bring

07:36.320 --> 07:40.840
that up a little more and then I'll time it, I'll try to get like some use case

07:40.840 --> 07:44.280
timing done in time for last on Sunday.

07:44.280 --> 07:49.160
But I find this whole concept, maybe once I get this review done, maybe I should load

07:49.160 --> 07:52.520
OpenSUSE on there and see if there's a big difference.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.040
And if there is, then I might try it with other distros too.

07:55.040 --> 07:59.840
TLP is also cool, as someone in the chat room actually just mentioned just now.

07:59.840 --> 08:00.840
That's definitely good.

08:00.840 --> 08:04.360
I'm really, really careful with it because it's one of those things to where you can

08:04.360 --> 08:06.840
just end up breaking something and then you have to like go back and figure out what you

08:06.840 --> 08:07.840
broke.

08:07.840 --> 08:13.240
I also like the idea of checking like IO top and using IO top to see what's hitting your

08:13.240 --> 08:18.320
disc because it could be possible like by default, maybe the KDE, maybe some search

08:18.320 --> 08:23.560
indexer like the KDE search indexer is, I'm sorry, the plasma desktop search indexer is

08:23.560 --> 08:27.560
set to a more moderate aggressive level or who knows, right?

08:27.560 --> 08:29.280
I mean, I'm just throwing things out there.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.960
So IO top would reveal that if something was hitting your disc a lot.

08:31.960 --> 08:32.960
True.

08:32.960 --> 08:33.960
That's very true.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.640
If you have battery experiences and you want to send them in, please do.

08:36.640 --> 08:42.520
But include, if you're using an SSD, your generation of processor and your GPU and relevant

08:42.520 --> 08:46.200
like screen size info and things like that so that way we can take that into consideration

08:46.200 --> 08:48.140
when we're talking about this stuff.

08:48.140 --> 08:54.000
So we talked something, really, I mean 99.9% of our feedback was about the how-to show.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.520
It was so many ideas that it's kind of blowing my mind and it's freaking me out a little

08:57.520 --> 09:03.880
bit because there's a lot of ideas that completely are in contradiction of what the next email

09:03.880 --> 09:04.880
says.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.240
And so it's gotten me a little worried that so many people are kind of disagreeing with

09:08.240 --> 09:11.480
each other without realizing it like, well, I get an idea where somebody will say, take

09:11.480 --> 09:15.760
a topic and really spend some time with it and make three or four episodes out of that

09:15.760 --> 09:16.760
single topic.

09:16.760 --> 09:21.040
And then the next email will say, only one episode.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.640
Make it as long as you need to get to one topic.

09:23.640 --> 09:24.640
Don't stretch it out.

09:24.640 --> 09:25.640
I won't watch it if you do that.

09:25.640 --> 09:30.040
Like all this different, or one that my favorite, which would be awesome if we had a staff of

09:30.040 --> 09:36.800
40, my favorite suggestion was do an intro video that sets up the problem.

09:36.800 --> 09:42.120
Like here on How To Linux Today, we're going to show you how to do X and then kind of talk

09:42.120 --> 09:43.120
about a little bit.

09:43.120 --> 09:44.120
Then that stops.

09:44.120 --> 09:49.160
We're going to do a five minute video and then have like 20 or 30 sub videos that then

09:49.160 --> 09:52.920
the person would click on that would be how to do it in Ubuntu, how to do it in Arch,

09:52.920 --> 09:56.180
how to do it in OpenSUSE, how to do it in CentOS, how to do it in Debian, how to do

09:56.180 --> 09:58.160
it in et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

09:58.160 --> 10:01.640
And I could see how that could be really handy for the Linux community.

10:01.640 --> 10:05.200
But yeah, it has a lot of, can you imagine from the production standpoint, from a production

10:05.200 --> 10:06.200
that it'd be a nightmare.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.480
But not, I mean, it's like, it's one of those things where it's like from an archival point

10:09.480 --> 10:11.060
of view, it's awesome.

10:11.060 --> 10:13.120
From a show point of view, it'd be a nightmare.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.120
Yeah, yeah.

10:14.120 --> 10:20.280
So what I, you know, I think what I can tell you is it would be really interesting to see

10:20.280 --> 10:24.160
if maybe the community could come in and a few people suggested this.

10:24.160 --> 10:28.960
Maybe the community could come in and provide the documentation for the distro they love

10:28.960 --> 10:30.360
that we didn't cover.

10:30.360 --> 10:34.700
And so that starts to, that's got my wheels turning on how we could build an interactive

10:34.700 --> 10:39.820
community website that would provide a written documentation version of what we talked about.

10:39.820 --> 10:43.440
We would have one official probably that would match the show, and then maybe we could have

10:43.440 --> 10:47.020
multiple versions for different distributions that the community could tribute.

10:47.020 --> 10:51.280
And maybe we'd have to have like three or four or five or six or seven originally hand

10:51.280 --> 10:54.360
selected contributors at first to make sure it was good, and then kind of grow it from

10:54.360 --> 10:55.360
there.

10:55.360 --> 10:58.420
But it's something, you know, it's a lot of feedback we're taking in.

10:58.420 --> 11:04.400
I'm going to try to send out the official like, hey, we'd like you to be our producer

11:04.400 --> 11:08.880
email this week, so we're going to have that finally done, I hope.

11:08.880 --> 11:12.720
And we, between that and the new studio, we've got a lot on our plate right now, but I feel

11:12.720 --> 11:16.020
like we're, there's a lot of people out there that want this.

11:16.020 --> 11:20.920
But the other topic we talked about last week besides that, that did get one response, is

11:20.920 --> 11:24.440
the one here from Alex, and that was about Outlook's inertia, and we talked a little

11:24.440 --> 11:27.520
bit about the exchange problem that Linux switchers face.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.680
He says, thank you for the wonderful shows, I got to start it with Jupyter Broadcasting

11:30.680 --> 11:35.360
back in the stoked days, recently came back after finding BSD now and then TechSnap and

11:35.360 --> 11:38.560
last and unplugged and go to radio, et cetera, et cetera.

11:38.560 --> 11:43.080
He said, listening to Linux Unplugged 29, there was a comment made about needing exchange

11:43.080 --> 11:47.240
or MAPI compatibility, or essentially Outlook.

11:47.240 --> 11:51.960
As someone who has been trying to migrate the small business he supports over to Linux,

11:51.960 --> 11:57.320
the big issue I see is that open source groupware packages, both server and client side, really

11:57.320 --> 12:01.520
do not measure up to the standard that is exchange and Outlook.

12:01.520 --> 12:06.400
For all of its wards, Microsoft has gotten groupware mostly right, when you have requirements

12:06.400 --> 12:11.880
that mail be hosted internally, and unique groupware and mobile sync, the choice, currently,

12:11.880 --> 12:12.880
is exchange.

12:12.880 --> 12:18.600
Zimbra keeps getting passed around like a hot potato, I have used most of my two free

12:18.600 --> 12:25.640
months of DigitalOcean trying out Zimbra with OpenLDAP, I've got it working, and others

12:25.640 --> 12:29.480
don't seem to be, but others don't seem to enjoy all the functionality yet, any suggestions

12:29.480 --> 12:31.480
would be appreciated.

12:31.480 --> 12:40.000
Alex, oh man, so, you know, what do you like, do you have like a calendar contact sync system

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
you use?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Are you using like Google, Matt?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
What are you using?

12:43.000 --> 12:46.600
Well, right now I use a little bit of Google, that's pretty much where I've fallen into

12:46.600 --> 12:47.960
at this point.

12:47.960 --> 12:53.080
For one of my gigs, I have to live in a Microsoft space, and so we use Exchange, and anyone

12:53.080 --> 12:57.520
that tells me it's flawless has not spent much time with Exchange, in my opinion.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.520
It's painful.

12:58.520 --> 13:04.280
That being said, it is less painful than a lot of the open source groupware solutions,

13:04.280 --> 13:07.440
as was pointed out, and so I agree with that, I mean, that's actually accurate.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.840
But none of them are really that good.

13:09.840 --> 13:14.360
Google honestly, while it's missing some functionality that I would like to see, I'd say it's probably

13:14.360 --> 13:15.820
the least annoying.

13:15.820 --> 13:19.200
They're all annoying, but I'd say it's the least annoying experience that I've ever dealt

13:19.200 --> 13:20.200
with.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.000
The nice thing about Google is you don't have to deal with the back end if you don't want

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
to.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Right, yeah.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.880
I mean, I don't want you to understand that your stuff's open to whatever, but it is anyway,

13:27.880 --> 13:28.880
so yeah.

13:28.880 --> 13:29.880
Yeah, gosh, that's the part.

13:29.880 --> 13:36.960
I mean, I'm not a huge fan of that part, to be honest, but I think, you know, I like Zimbra.

13:36.960 --> 13:46.240
I just think what the problem is is Exchange, you sort of create a workflow around Outlook

13:46.240 --> 13:50.640
and Exchange, and when you move to one of these other options like Zimbra or any of

13:50.640 --> 13:56.560
the other ones that are out there, it's a different workflow, and if you started on

13:56.560 --> 13:58.520
that, it would be fine.

13:58.520 --> 14:02.640
But because you've trained, you know, those mental pathways in your brain are laid down

14:02.640 --> 14:08.880
for the way that it's sort of like why I sometimes have a little bit easier time using Gnome

14:08.880 --> 14:15.520
is because honestly, I learned a lot of things the Gnome way, and so it's just way in my

14:15.520 --> 14:20.680
mind like that's just the way the neural pathways are is like the electrons fire faster down

14:20.680 --> 14:22.600
those paths, and it's the same thing for Outlook.

14:22.600 --> 14:27.360
If you've learned how the whole Outlook calendar system works, and I know people out there

14:27.360 --> 14:32.320
like depend on the rich text formatting of Outlook and all this kind of junk that Outlook

14:32.320 --> 14:38.320
does, but to them, it's an essential part of the job, and sometimes these replacements

14:38.320 --> 14:39.560
do it differently.

14:39.560 --> 14:43.880
Sometimes they don't offer something at all, so a lot of times people say they don't size

14:43.880 --> 14:44.880
up.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.440
In reality, it's just different workflow, I think.

14:47.440 --> 14:51.520
Yeah, I'd say workflow, and muscle memory in general, I think, is a real tough one to

14:51.520 --> 14:55.360
get past, regardless of what your skill set may happen to be.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.840
I mean, muscle memory kind of rules the day.

14:57.840 --> 14:58.840
Colab is a great choice.

14:58.840 --> 15:03.720
Chatham is right now talking about Colab, and you can find them at colab.org.

15:03.720 --> 15:07.640
It's a free software initiative building a unified communications and collaboration system

15:07.640 --> 15:12.280
that you can install on your own server, and it offers a lot of the functionality that

15:12.280 --> 15:17.880
we talk about a lot that Zimbra also offers, and Colab's on my short list of like the three

15:17.880 --> 15:22.060
that I'm going to be considering installing for Jupyter Broadcasting this year.

15:22.060 --> 15:23.060
This is one of the goals.

15:23.060 --> 15:29.640
I don't know if I'm going to get to it, because right now, this is one of those things where

15:29.640 --> 15:34.780
Google's doing a good enough job, and I don't feel super pressured to replace them, even

15:34.780 --> 15:39.700
though I know there's a privacy problem there, and a lot of other issues there as well, tracking

15:39.700 --> 15:44.800
and all that kind of stuff, but because it's my work email, it's not like I have some sort

15:44.800 --> 15:50.280
of dirty exchange with some bankster in there or something like that that I don't want to

15:50.280 --> 15:51.280
get caught, right?

15:51.280 --> 15:54.480
I mean, it's not like... It's my work email, and most of the email that's in there gets

15:54.480 --> 15:56.640
read on there anyways eventually.

15:56.640 --> 15:57.640
This is true.

15:57.640 --> 15:58.640
This is very true.

15:58.640 --> 16:01.840
So I'm not super compelled to do it, but I am looking into my options, and Zimbra and

16:01.840 --> 16:07.280
Colab are on my short list, so I actually really thank Alex for sending that in to us

16:07.280 --> 16:11.160
just so I can get his thoughts on it, because to tell you the truth, I'd probably roll it

16:11.160 --> 16:15.080
out on a DigitalOcean VPS too, which means I should probably stop right here and thank

16:15.080 --> 16:18.120
DigitalOcean this week for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

16:18.120 --> 16:21.600
DigitalOcean is a sponsor of the Linux Unplugged program, and as you've heard, a lot of our

16:21.600 --> 16:25.960
audience is finding really awesome ways to try out DigitalOcean.

16:25.960 --> 16:26.960
Now you're not familiar with DigitalOcean?

16:26.960 --> 16:28.640
Well, I'll tell you right now.

16:28.640 --> 16:31.940
DigitalOcean is simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

16:31.940 --> 16:33.800
to spin up your own cloud server.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.760
You get root access to this bad mamma jamma, and users can create a cloud server in 55

16:37.760 --> 16:38.760
seconds.

16:38.760 --> 16:42.800
I bet Alex was in the 40s somewhere, although he didn't say in his email.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.600
Pricing plans start around $5 per month.

16:45.600 --> 16:52.520
That gets you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, yes, an SSD makes a difference on a VPS,

16:52.520 --> 16:56.320
trust me, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

16:56.320 --> 17:01.120
A terabyte of transfer, like if you're using this for email or like Yassi search or a pastebin

17:01.120 --> 17:05.680
repository or a BitTorrent sync server, a terabyte of transfer is going to get you a

17:05.680 --> 17:07.800
really far, a long ways.

17:07.800 --> 17:11.600
Also DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam, and

17:11.600 --> 17:12.600
now Singapore.

17:12.600 --> 17:17.000
They have a simple intuitive interface, but if you want more power, you want to automate

17:17.000 --> 17:21.600
some stuff, you can also implement your own set of scripts and things like that using

17:21.600 --> 17:23.260
their straightforward API.

17:23.260 --> 17:28.760
For example, you might want to utilize their API to automate image backups of your VPS

17:28.760 --> 17:32.520
systems, and they have a system to let you do that, but here's the best part.

17:32.520 --> 17:37.360
You can get a $10 credit to try out, they have a $5 rig, that's the one I told you about,

17:37.360 --> 17:40.040
$5 rig, you try out their $10 credit, you're going to be able to use it for two months

17:40.040 --> 17:43.440
for free if you use the promo code LINUXUNPLUGGEDMARCH.

17:43.440 --> 17:46.900
Brand new month, DigitalOcean is back, because you guys have been loving them.

17:46.900 --> 17:51.580
We've gotten a lot of people to try it out, and you can go over there right now, use the

17:51.580 --> 17:55.880
promo code LINUXUNPLUGGEDMARCH, you get one of these bad mama jamas for two months, you

17:55.880 --> 18:02.240
get tier one bandwidth, connected to those SSD hard drives, and backed by KVM virtualization.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.640
It's a really good system.

18:03.640 --> 18:06.800
They also have hourly pricing if you just need to test out your app.

18:06.800 --> 18:12.080
They also have images that are set up and ready to go with Lampstacks or Docker.

18:12.080 --> 18:17.680
They support Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu, all of the stuff, CentOS, all of it.

18:17.680 --> 18:21.760
They have two-factor authentication, backups and snapshots, all that good stuff.

18:21.760 --> 18:27.360
So go over to DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code LINUXUNPLUGGEDMARCH to get $10 credits,

18:27.360 --> 18:31.480
you can try it out for two months, and I think you'll see, I've been talking about them for

18:31.480 --> 18:35.400
a while now, and also a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged for the month

18:35.400 --> 18:36.640
of March.

18:36.640 --> 18:37.640
You guys are awesome.

18:37.640 --> 18:38.640
Love it.

18:38.640 --> 18:39.800
All right, Matt.

18:39.800 --> 18:44.120
So I want to welcome two developers from the TOX Project onto the show.

18:44.120 --> 18:48.760
Joining us on Mumble right now, we have STQ and I run Gentoo.

18:48.760 --> 18:53.440
So I know TOX started up as sort of a discussion thread, and I'm told, I think it started on

18:53.440 --> 18:57.840
4chan, and now here we are, we're what, seven, eight months down the road, it's become a

18:57.840 --> 18:59.520
very active project.

18:59.520 --> 19:04.400
So where is it at from where it started versus where it's at today?

19:04.400 --> 19:12.480
Well, TOX started as, well, I actually, I had this idea, this very basic idea, and then,

19:12.480 --> 19:24.040
well, I was on a thread on G, that was speaking about how Skype is, well, privacy issues with

19:24.040 --> 19:25.040
Skype.

19:25.040 --> 19:31.640
So, well, I had just, well, I just decided, okay, hey, let's, I was actually a bit maybe

19:31.640 --> 19:40.440
drunk at the moment or something, and I said, okay, let's make a Skype replacement.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.080
So that's how it started.

19:43.080 --> 19:49.240
And then, well, I was very impressed by the positive response from everyone.

19:49.240 --> 19:57.760
So I said, okay, let's start writing code, let's start planning stuff, and that's how

19:57.760 --> 19:59.320
TOX started.

19:59.320 --> 20:02.920
So it started kind of as a crazy idea that maybe after you thought about it for a little

20:02.920 --> 20:05.100
bit realized, this could be a good idea.

20:05.100 --> 20:09.440
Have you worked on this kind of stuff before or something like this before?

20:09.440 --> 20:20.000
Well, I played around with some BitTorrent DHT, I did a couple of scripts to, I once

20:20.000 --> 20:29.840
made a script to find out which, to try to track everything on the BitTorrent DHT.

20:29.840 --> 20:38.560
But well, there were some little bandwidth issues, well, I would have needed a big server

20:38.560 --> 20:47.380
and something, so the idea kind of died, but that gave me a bit of experience on how peer-to-peer

20:47.380 --> 20:52.720
software works and everything, so that's, that's how I...

20:52.720 --> 20:53.720
Yeah.

20:53.720 --> 20:57.660
Well, can you tell me a little bit about, and I guess it's actually pronounced salt,

20:57.660 --> 21:03.120
but the networking and cryptography library that TOX is sitting on primarily, is this

21:03.120 --> 21:05.320
the big piece of functionality here?

21:05.320 --> 21:08.040
How does, what does this component play?

21:08.040 --> 21:09.520
What role does that play?

21:09.520 --> 21:18.720
Well, that's the, it's, I seriously, I like that crypto, I love that crypto library.

21:18.720 --> 21:23.120
It's very simple to use and everything, and it's very secure.

21:23.120 --> 21:26.920
I don't think TOX would have worked without it.

21:26.920 --> 21:37.760
It's since, well, TOX, when TOX started, we didn't know what crypto library would use.

21:37.760 --> 21:38.760
Right.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.920
That seems like a huge choice to make, right?

21:40.920 --> 21:47.360
Yeah, but then someone suggested it in a thread, and then I looked at it, and I just saw, this

21:47.360 --> 21:48.360
is perfect.

21:48.360 --> 21:53.960
It's simple to use, it's fast, it's very secure.

21:53.960 --> 22:02.840
It protects against all types of timing attacks, et cetera, so that's, so we picked that, and

22:02.840 --> 22:11.320
I started reading a lot, okay, so how do I implement this correctly in TOX without screwing

22:11.320 --> 22:12.320
up things?

22:12.320 --> 22:16.400
Well, that was my question, because I've heard that, I think also the Telegram Messenger

22:16.400 --> 22:21.160
program uses the salt library, but I guess they maybe, I don't know the details, but

22:21.160 --> 22:23.520
I guess they've implemented it incorrectly.

22:23.520 --> 22:28.360
Have you looked at that situation and tried to kind of balance what they did wrong and

22:28.360 --> 22:30.760
adjust accordingly for TOX?

22:30.760 --> 22:38.960
Well, Telegram, they don't use the salt library, they use their custom crypto implementation.

22:38.960 --> 22:43.900
If they would have used the salt library, their crypto would have been fine, nobody

22:43.900 --> 22:46.200
would be complaining about it.

22:46.200 --> 22:47.680
Right, gotcha.

22:47.680 --> 22:52.160
So something that seemed kind of like a big deal, you guys got accepted, the TOX project

22:52.160 --> 22:55.760
got accepted into the Google Summer of Code, but you know a lot of people have asked, is

22:55.760 --> 22:58.500
that going to influence the project in any way?

22:58.500 --> 23:00.120
What about their independence?

23:00.120 --> 23:04.000
What are your thoughts on the Summer of Code and what it means for that aspect of the project?

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
I'll go ahead and answer this.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Sure.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.860
Well, I think with Google Summer of Code, we're really going to be able to finish a

23:11.860 --> 23:17.000
lot of things that we wouldn't have the time to do that, due to our prior commitments we

23:17.000 --> 23:18.480
would never be able to do.

23:18.480 --> 23:23.520
We would be able to have people who have different skill sets in areas we might not have, it

23:23.520 --> 23:26.000
would be able to help out that way.

23:26.000 --> 23:31.200
Okay, so, and you know, what about this criticism that people have said, oh well, this is a

23:31.200 --> 23:35.400
bad sign, this is about influence, what do you think of that?

23:35.400 --> 23:39.480
Has there been communications from Google about suggestions or anything like that?

23:39.480 --> 23:45.200
No, they don't do anything like that, they just purely foster the development of open

23:45.200 --> 23:51.280
source projects, no secret influences, no link to this secret library, nothing like

23:51.280 --> 23:52.280
that.

23:52.280 --> 23:59.120
No insert go to fail line here, that's good, that's good considering that, you know, there's

23:59.120 --> 24:02.800
a lot of hopes riding on a secure messenger and I got to tell you guys, this is a pretty

24:02.800 --> 24:05.080
contested space right now.

24:05.080 --> 24:11.060
So I think people are looking for a lot of things to pull out to kind of criticize on.

24:11.060 --> 24:16.040
And to that end, I think, and I didn't, I don't really know if there is something to

24:16.040 --> 24:19.900
be worried about here, but a lot of people have criticized that they started as a threat

24:19.900 --> 24:24.480
on 4chan and have you guys dealt with growing pains as a result of that?

24:24.480 --> 24:31.800
Well, we didn't start like that, but as we developed, we got people with skill sets from

24:31.800 --> 24:36.040
Reddit and all these areas and sort of nurtured.

24:36.040 --> 24:38.920
That's exactly, I mean, so when I, I mean, not to interrupt, I'm sorry, but when I, when

24:38.920 --> 24:42.240
I, so I've seen this question, it was sent into our show a few times and to me, it just

24:42.240 --> 24:45.480
seems like these are locations that technical people hang out.

24:45.480 --> 24:52.040
True, so 4chan specifically, that little area is a lot of trolling.

24:52.040 --> 24:59.000
I think it was pure luck that the people who we have now, that all the skill matched up

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
just perfectly.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Yeah, yeah.

25:01.000 --> 25:06.000
Well, I, and I, and I know, I know it's something that's on people's radar and it maybe seems

25:06.000 --> 25:07.560
like one of those things down the road.

25:07.560 --> 25:11.920
It probably, it, it probably won't be as big of a factor, but what are any other growing

25:11.920 --> 25:15.440
pains you guys are seeing as the project is becoming more aware, people are becoming

25:15.440 --> 25:18.560
more aware of it?

25:18.560 --> 25:19.560
Not really.

25:19.560 --> 25:28.880
Well, there's always a bit of issues, but we do, we, we've dealt with them and it's

25:28.880 --> 25:29.880
good.

25:29.880 --> 25:31.360
Well, okay.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.280
So that's the big picture stuff.

25:33.280 --> 25:37.600
I want to talk a little bit about maybe features and stuff that talks is hoping to support

25:37.600 --> 25:39.060
down the road.

25:39.060 --> 25:45.120
What are your plans for three, there's three major things I've seen requests from the audience.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.600
Uh, conference call setups.

25:46.600 --> 25:50.080
Do you guys have any plans to do things like group calls and things like that down the

25:50.080 --> 25:51.080
road?

25:51.080 --> 25:52.080
Yes.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.480
Okay, good.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.040
What about multiple presence?

25:55.040 --> 25:59.760
As in I can be logged in on a, on multiple computers and the message goes to all locations

25:59.760 --> 26:05.280
or maybe I'm on my, I'm on my Android phone and I'm also on my laptop and I want my messages

26:05.280 --> 26:06.760
and calls to go to both locations.

26:06.760 --> 26:09.960
Is that possible with the security model you're using now?

26:09.960 --> 26:13.960
You know, we haven't worked out something like that just yet.

26:13.960 --> 26:19.360
We're still working on a lot of our group chats, how we can do audio and video, how

26:19.360 --> 26:24.520
we can do things like that, but when the time comes, I know we'll be able to reach that

26:24.520 --> 26:25.520
area.

26:25.520 --> 26:33.000
Yeah, it's a, it's possible, but, uh, it's a later after, after we've done the TCP stuff,

26:33.000 --> 26:36.960
after we've done the, the group chats and the work and, uh,

26:36.960 --> 26:39.000
So is that how you're focusing right now?

26:39.000 --> 26:42.440
It seems like the talks clients that I've tried are all text chat based to get that

26:42.440 --> 26:46.720
working and then as the plan to then to get the next set of functionality working and

26:46.720 --> 26:47.720
then the next.

26:47.720 --> 26:48.720
Yeah.

26:48.720 --> 26:54.840
It's a, it's how, uh, well, I think it's the best way to develop software to, uh, do make

26:54.840 --> 27:01.160
a feature, test it correctly, add another, add another, and, uh, that's, uh,

27:01.160 --> 27:05.720
So what's on your immediate list and then what's on your sort of, after I get this next

27:05.720 --> 27:09.360
immediate problem solved, after I get this thing that's bugging me fixed, I really want

27:09.360 --> 27:10.840
to start working on.

27:10.840 --> 27:12.440
So what are those two things?

27:12.440 --> 27:18.580
Well, we have first the, the thing that I want to finish first, well, that I'm working

27:18.580 --> 27:28.880
on right now is, uh, the TCP, uh, TCP stuff so that, uh, I want to add a TCP relay functionality

27:28.880 --> 27:38.460
to talks, uh, node so that, uh, people that are behind bad knots and, uh, can, uh, can

27:38.460 --> 27:44.200
also use stocks currently talks only works people with that can, uh, hole punch through

27:44.200 --> 27:45.200
their knots.

27:45.200 --> 27:46.200
Okay.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.200
But that's not everyone.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.200
Yeah.

27:48.200 --> 27:53.400
Some people are behind enterprise knots, some symmetric knots that are weird and on and

27:53.400 --> 28:02.280
block certain, uh, like, yeah, they only have a maximum number of UDP connections that can,

28:02.280 --> 28:09.280
well, that can be a problem because, well, talks needs to connect to a bunch of people

28:09.280 --> 28:10.280
for discovery.

28:10.280 --> 28:11.280
Yeah.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.280
Yeah.

28:12.280 --> 28:13.280
So, okay.

28:13.280 --> 28:18.280
I look at this and I think if talks was really successful, I, if, if you could truly create

28:18.280 --> 28:25.040
a Skype replacement that was secure, you would have a system that would be used by, by journalists,

28:25.040 --> 28:29.520
by dissidents, by the paranoid and by cheaters.

28:29.520 --> 28:36.040
And, uh, it would be this, these groups of people would fundamentally rely on this technology

28:36.040 --> 28:39.920
to be absolutely iron clad solid.

28:39.920 --> 28:44.720
Have you considered code audits and, and maybe you add a certain like quote unquote official

28:44.720 --> 28:49.320
release point saying we're going to audit the code, have a third party look at the code?

28:49.320 --> 28:55.480
Well, yes, of course, but we want to wait till a lot of our major features are done.

28:55.480 --> 29:00.360
And talking about what you mentioned earlier, we're designing talks to be something that

29:00.360 --> 29:05.080
everyone can use someone talking, someone somewhere.

29:05.080 --> 29:08.980
I have no idea what I'm saying right now, but long story short, we want to design something

29:08.980 --> 29:13.800
that's so fast, so easy, so smooth that people would use it instead of Skype.

29:13.800 --> 29:20.120
I mean, we're not going to truly accomplish our goal unless everyone's using this, unless

29:20.120 --> 29:24.320
there's nothing that can be spied on, nothing that can be new.

29:24.320 --> 29:29.920
Security isn't a selling point for end users, but we want to give it to everyone.

29:29.920 --> 29:31.560
That's an interesting way to put it.

29:31.560 --> 29:35.760
I mean, it's definitely, it's definitely for some, but yeah, you're right.

29:35.760 --> 29:38.680
For the general user, it's not really, it's not really a big deal.

29:38.680 --> 29:42.360
Uh, you know, the only really other question I had sent in from the audience that was kind

29:42.360 --> 29:46.640
of kicking around is, uh, how do you guys plan to make money and are you going to take

29:46.640 --> 29:47.640
donations?

29:47.640 --> 29:55.600
No, we might take donations and so Gentoo's been talking about it a bit, but right now

29:55.600 --> 30:00.660
all of our expenses, our build systems, everything comes out of my own pocket and I haven't really

30:00.660 --> 30:01.760
been taking anything in.

30:01.760 --> 30:05.360
Well, you're a good man, SDQ.

30:05.360 --> 30:11.200
So have you considered like a donation system or like a Kickstarter system or something

30:11.200 --> 30:12.200
like that?

30:12.200 --> 30:14.520
Um, can you repeat the question?

30:14.520 --> 30:15.520
I couldn't hear you.

30:15.520 --> 30:16.520
Are you thinking about, are you guys?

30:16.520 --> 30:20.120
Cause the reason I'm asking is we had a few people send in like longplay wrote in and

30:20.120 --> 30:23.960
asked if, uh, you guys would, he wants to send you money, but he couldn't find a way

30:23.960 --> 30:24.960
to donate.

30:24.960 --> 30:28.880
Are you considering doing a donation model?

30:28.880 --> 30:38.000
We might put a donation button on the website because the reason I didn't want donations

30:38.000 --> 30:46.360
to, well us accepting donations at the beginning is, well, what if, uh, we just started and

30:46.360 --> 30:50.920
then everything fails and well, people are going to be angry and everything.

30:50.920 --> 30:54.320
But well, we've, uh, we've gone a long way from there.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.440
So we might, uh, that's good.

30:57.440 --> 30:58.440
It's good.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.440
Yeah.

30:59.440 --> 31:00.440
Yeah.

31:00.440 --> 31:02.020
You want to make sure you got something that, uh, you can, you can show for before you ask

31:02.020 --> 31:03.160
people to start taking money.

31:03.160 --> 31:06.720
Well, also I'll open it up to the mumble room and see if there's any questions that the

31:06.720 --> 31:07.720
group has.

31:07.720 --> 31:10.560
Um, and you guys, if you do just ping me in the chat room with any questions you have

31:10.560 --> 31:14.560
for the folks and we'll, we'll get through those and the chat room, I'm also checking

31:14.560 --> 31:19.320
your questions as, as we go, but, uh, guys, I want to thank you for coming on Linux Unplugged.

31:19.320 --> 31:22.680
As this project I'm going to be watching, you know, I'm, I'm still really interested

31:22.680 --> 31:25.360
in picking the mobile messenger of the future.

31:25.360 --> 31:30.560
And right now the Jupiter Broadcasting Network really kind of uses Skype a lot for our shows

31:30.560 --> 31:35.260
because at the end of the day, it seems to be the, the sort of the best combination of

31:35.260 --> 31:40.480
deployment and ease of use and actual video and audio quality simultaneously.

31:40.480 --> 31:42.620
I'm really excited about the talks project.

31:42.620 --> 31:47.120
We talked about it a little bit this last Sunday on the Linux Action Show and I demoed

31:47.120 --> 31:49.120
a couple of different apps you can use for it.

31:49.120 --> 31:54.460
It's early days right now, uh, but, uh, I, I, I want to encourage you guys to keep going

31:54.460 --> 31:57.520
at it, keep working at it because this is a space that people are going to be more and

31:57.520 --> 32:00.080
more interested over the, uh, the next couple of years.

32:00.080 --> 32:05.360
Crossroads asks, uh, how does this compare to other chat programs, e.g. BT Chat or Tor

32:05.360 --> 32:06.360
Chat?

32:06.360 --> 32:07.360
And actually that's a great question.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.520
Have you guys seen the announcement of Tor Chat and what are your thoughts on that versus

32:10.520 --> 32:11.520
talks?

32:11.520 --> 32:24.080
Well, Tor Chat is, uh, they're going more on the anonymous, uh, well, they want to make

32:24.080 --> 32:29.640
an anonymous chat, but, uh, talks is, uh, isn't anonymous.

32:29.640 --> 32:35.960
You connect directly to the people you're speaking to because, uh, we want performance

32:35.960 --> 32:44.480
because, well, streaming, uh, high resolution video through Tor is, well, doesn't really

32:44.480 --> 32:45.480
work well.

32:45.480 --> 32:46.480
That's true, right?

32:46.480 --> 32:47.480
Yeah.

32:47.480 --> 32:48.480
That's a great point.

32:48.480 --> 32:49.480
Yeah.

32:49.480 --> 32:50.480
I hadn't thought about the video aspect of it.

32:50.480 --> 32:51.480
And to reiterate further.

32:51.480 --> 32:52.480
Yeah.

32:52.480 --> 32:53.480
Go ahead.

32:53.480 --> 33:01.480
I mean, we're trying to design something that everyone can use, not just the paranoid.

33:01.480 --> 33:05.600
Well, and, and to that end, is that why, I mean, I'm seeing a lot of, a lot of different

33:05.600 --> 33:06.600
talks clients.

33:06.600 --> 33:09.280
There's not like one official talks client.

33:09.280 --> 33:13.080
I guess it would be conceivable that you could have chat programs like Pidgin out there and

33:13.080 --> 33:16.640
others that support talks and Tor Chat at the same time.

33:16.640 --> 33:17.640
Right?

33:17.640 --> 33:18.640
Yeah.

33:18.640 --> 33:22.280
Pidgin for a, there's a talks plugin in development already.

33:22.280 --> 33:28.160
So it, uh, it already supports, uh, talks, but very good.

33:28.160 --> 33:29.480
That's very interesting you guys.

33:29.480 --> 33:32.960
And, uh, I'm glad you're working on this to tell you the truth because, uh, one of my

33:32.960 --> 33:38.880
predictions for, uh, the, the, uh, the Linux action show for 2014 was that there'd be an

33:38.880 --> 33:40.600
explosion in secure messaging.

33:40.600 --> 33:44.480
So you guys are right now confirming my prediction.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.560
So that's awesome for me.

33:45.560 --> 33:46.560
Most definitely.

33:46.560 --> 33:47.560
Yeah.

33:47.560 --> 33:48.560
I know, right?

33:48.560 --> 33:53.280
Uh, so you guys, I know, I know you guys probably are not big fans of giving out timelines,

33:53.280 --> 33:57.680
but do you have a general big picture timeline or roadmap of when features will roll out

33:57.680 --> 33:59.920
or be available?

33:59.920 --> 34:05.480
I can tell you the, well, the order at which we're going to roll them out, but timelines

34:05.480 --> 34:07.440
are a bit, uh, I'll take that.

34:07.440 --> 34:08.600
I'll take order of that.

34:08.600 --> 34:10.080
You want to roll things out for sure.

34:10.080 --> 34:14.480
Well, first of all, we're going to roll out the TCP relays.

34:14.480 --> 34:20.160
Then after that, we're going to work, uh, on, uh, fixing our group chats and making

34:20.160 --> 34:23.680
audio video work in group chats.

34:23.680 --> 34:29.200
And well, that's the two main, that should take a while because they're, they're two

34:29.200 --> 34:35.160
very big, uh, features that they're going to need lots of testing and everything.

34:35.160 --> 34:42.000
And after that, we're going to concentrate on, well, whatever, uh, well, maybe optimizing

34:42.000 --> 34:51.440
code or, uh, trying to implement other features like offline messaging and like how someone

34:51.440 --> 34:59.560
who wants to be logged in at two computers that might, uh, might work on that.

34:59.560 --> 35:03.600
It depends on, well, what we feel people want the most.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.600
What they're asking for.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.600
Yeah.

35:05.600 --> 35:06.600
Well, let me ask you this.

35:06.600 --> 35:09.320
What if somebody, Daredevilin's making a great question, making a great point in our chat

35:09.320 --> 35:10.320
room.

35:10.320 --> 35:14.840
What if, what if you, uh, were, uh, you wake up one day, you go to slash dot or tech meme

35:14.840 --> 35:20.400
or Reddit or whatever, and you see a top headline, new secure messenger launched available

35:20.400 --> 35:24.080
on Android, iOS, and the desktop, um, it's, it's awesome.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.080
It's rock solid.

35:25.080 --> 35:28.440
And you dig through it and when you see they're charging, they're charging for the app and

35:28.440 --> 35:32.300
then you'd read through the details and you realize, holy crap, they're using talks.

35:32.300 --> 35:36.640
How do you feel about people creating clients or potentially business models on top of a

35:36.640 --> 35:38.760
system that you're building today?

35:38.760 --> 35:47.760
Well, the core is licensed under the GPL v3, so they can't take the code and not give the

35:47.760 --> 35:48.960
source back.

35:48.960 --> 35:54.400
So well, if someone does take it and improves their source and if they make money, I don't

35:54.400 --> 35:58.040
care if they, because they're improving the software.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.120
So Daredevilin, I didn't realize you're in here.

36:00.120 --> 36:01.120
Go ahead.

36:01.120 --> 36:03.120
And did you have more you wanted to add to that?

36:03.120 --> 36:04.120
Daredevilin?

36:04.120 --> 36:05.120
No.

36:05.120 --> 36:06.120
Sorry.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.120
I'm here.

36:07.120 --> 36:08.120
Can you hear me?

36:08.120 --> 36:09.120
Yeah.

36:09.120 --> 36:10.120
Yeah.

36:10.120 --> 36:16.400
So what happened is, uh, the reason I got this question is because, uh, I was wondering

36:16.400 --> 36:21.720
more, uh, I know it's GPL and people are contributing back, but there's kind of business models

36:21.720 --> 36:26.920
that could involve, for example, a company making their own nodes in a way that, um,

36:26.920 --> 36:29.280
will allow them to mimic users.

36:29.280 --> 36:33.600
And I mean, depends of course on the intrinsic of the project, but then goes to something

36:33.600 --> 36:38.160
that is something a little bit deviated from original tax plans.

36:38.160 --> 36:41.400
And it goes like uses stock source code.

36:41.400 --> 36:46.240
It uses all like, uh, like, uh, bitcoins, litecoin, that kind of thing.

36:46.240 --> 36:47.240
Yeah.

36:47.240 --> 36:48.800
It's kind of, sorta.

36:48.800 --> 36:56.280
So it will be with some differences that will make more, uh, a company driven perspective

36:56.280 --> 37:01.040
and not actually providing the users direct access.

37:01.040 --> 37:06.680
So what are the measures in place for you to incentivize people to just come to your

37:06.680 --> 37:12.160
project instead of just working, doing something crazy that goes completely out of town?

37:12.160 --> 37:18.960
Well, if, if a company does something like that, well, and users actually use the software

37:18.960 --> 37:22.580
from that company, that means they're doing something good.

37:22.580 --> 37:23.840
So that's a win for you.

37:23.840 --> 37:31.640
Well, we can always take the code out and put it in our, in our project.

37:31.640 --> 37:36.920
And so, uh, Josh, go ahead.

37:36.920 --> 37:37.920
That's a good point.

37:37.920 --> 37:38.920
It's like, okay.

37:38.920 --> 37:39.920
Oh, okay.

37:39.920 --> 37:40.920
I mean, that's an interesting way to think about it.

37:40.920 --> 37:46.920
Like openBSD makes SSH and they give it away for people to do whatever they want with.

37:46.920 --> 37:47.920
Right.

37:47.920 --> 37:48.920
Great point.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.160
I mean, that's, that's an interesting way to kind of frame that.

37:50.160 --> 37:53.920
Uh, Josh, you had a kind of a question more about funding, right?

37:53.920 --> 37:55.760
Yes, I did.

37:55.760 --> 38:02.080
Um, so you guys talked about maybe monetizing or accepting donations in the future.

38:02.080 --> 38:07.100
So what is your opinion on allowing, you know, people to back certain features with something

38:07.100 --> 38:11.620
like Bounty Source, uh, and allow you guys to get paid to like implement certain features

38:11.620 --> 38:16.440
like group chats and maybe help speed the process along or provide some sort of monetary

38:16.440 --> 38:20.620
incentive?

38:20.620 --> 38:25.560
You know, I think something like that really hurts people's trust if something doesn't

38:25.560 --> 38:30.920
meet a timeline, if something looks good, looks like it's easy to do, but it doesn't

38:30.920 --> 38:34.880
come up and it ends up taking a lot longer than it should or something.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.240
People will get disappointed.

38:37.240 --> 38:44.820
Well, the main issue is that implementing something is a relatively easy implementing

38:44.820 --> 38:49.080
something that's bug free and works perfectly.

38:49.080 --> 38:51.200
That's a, that's hard.

38:51.200 --> 38:54.840
So well, that's a, that's an interesting point.

38:54.840 --> 38:55.840
Yeah.

38:55.840 --> 38:57.200
You don't, yeah, I, it is.

38:57.200 --> 39:01.640
So it's something to consider, I think, because it's really fascinating to really, it truly

39:01.640 --> 39:06.600
tells you what, what people's priorities are when they assign a dollar value to it in a

39:06.600 --> 39:11.600
way that is so much more tangible than, than emails and, and bug requests and all these

39:11.600 --> 39:14.580
things when people are actually willing to put money down for something, then you really

39:14.580 --> 39:17.840
know it's, it's literally of a value to them.

39:17.840 --> 39:21.320
Uh, so I, but I do understand you don't want to overset expectations and you guys seem

39:21.320 --> 39:23.880
to be, you know, uh, walking that line pretty closely.

39:23.880 --> 39:27.180
Uh, I'm going to take a quick break right here and when we get back, I want to talk

39:27.180 --> 39:32.240
a little bit about maybe your thoughts on the future of, uh, mobile for talks, but first

39:32.240 --> 39:35.520
speaking of mobile, I want to thank Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

39:35.520 --> 39:41.280
Go to linux.ting.com, yes, linux.ting.com, that's how awesome Ting is.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.380
Now what is Ting?

39:42.380 --> 39:46.800
It's mobile that makes sense, my friend, my mobile service provider, and of course Matt's

39:46.800 --> 39:48.680
mobile service provider.

39:48.680 --> 39:49.720
You bet.

39:49.720 --> 39:54.920
And Ting has no contracts, no early terminations, and by the way, you only pay for what you

39:54.920 --> 39:55.920
use.

39:55.920 --> 39:59.760
It's a flat rate every single month, and then just your usage on top of that.

39:59.760 --> 40:03.540
Every Ting plan includes hotspot and tethering, so you just go on Android, you just check

40:03.540 --> 40:04.620
that box.

40:04.620 --> 40:08.760
Every device you buy, you own it, so you're not anitizing that cost over like two years

40:08.760 --> 40:12.240
where you're still paying into something that's not nearly worth that, plus they have a super

40:12.240 --> 40:18.000
awesome dashboard that supports web standards that is, while simple to use, extremely powerful

40:18.000 --> 40:21.640
unless you set up a whole bunch of stuff you want for your phone, and they have no hold

40:21.640 --> 40:22.640
customer support.

40:22.640 --> 40:26.400
But what I really like about Ting is they're actually good people.

40:26.400 --> 40:29.680
They're a good company, they're good people, and they care about their customers.

40:29.680 --> 40:32.040
I'll give you an example over on their blog.

40:32.040 --> 40:38.500
They just posted yesterday six simple steps to save money on your smartphone mobile data,

40:38.500 --> 40:42.320
and they go through some of the big apps that a lot of smartphone users use, and a lot of

40:42.320 --> 40:46.920
the settings that already exist in those most popular apps like YouTube and Google Maps

40:46.920 --> 40:53.760
and Chrome and Facebook and Spotify and Gmail, they have all these different settings you

40:53.760 --> 40:58.600
can go through to actually conserve bandwidth, to save a little bit of money, and they've

40:58.600 --> 41:00.440
done posts like this in the past, too.

41:00.440 --> 41:03.120
They talk about Opera Max, for example.

41:03.120 --> 41:08.560
They've done posts like this on the minutes spectrum, and this was, Ting is, because the

41:08.560 --> 41:14.260
way Ting is structured with their flat rates and the pay for your usage, they really have

41:14.260 --> 41:18.520
a system that allows them to super serve the customer and not try to nickel and dime you

41:18.520 --> 41:21.680
like every other carrier does, and even the carriers that pretend like they're trying

41:21.680 --> 41:24.920
to make a big difference, they're actually still nickel and diming you.

41:24.920 --> 41:29.140
So go over to linux.ting.com, that'll save $25 off your first Ting device.

41:29.140 --> 41:32.500
If you already have a device that's compatible with the Sprint network, well then bring that

41:32.500 --> 41:35.920
with you, and then Ting will take $25 off your bill.

41:35.920 --> 41:37.480
They'll give you a $25 credit.

41:37.480 --> 41:41.640
By the way, they've got an early termination relief program, too, and that's awesome, because

41:41.640 --> 41:45.560
if you have a contract and you know that they're screwing you, you know you want to get out

41:45.560 --> 41:50.980
of that contract, you're sick of the BS, all you have to do is grab your Ting device, port

41:50.980 --> 41:56.280
your number, and then you submit an ETF claim over to Ting, and they'll pay you up to $75

41:56.280 --> 41:58.280
per line that you had to get canceled.

41:58.280 --> 42:00.200
And then once you get in there, the savings is crazy.

42:00.200 --> 42:02.160
In fact, check out their new savings calculator.

42:02.160 --> 42:03.960
They've updated it recently.

42:03.960 --> 42:07.440
If you have Verizon or T-Mobile or AT&T, you can plug that in there.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.880
It'll go get your bill information for you.

42:09.880 --> 42:12.720
If you don't, you can just plug in your data like you normally would, tell them how many

42:12.720 --> 42:15.900
cell phones you got, and then they'll tell you how much you would save.

42:15.900 --> 42:19.080
It's crazy when you see it, because Ting just recently dropped their data rates, too.

42:19.080 --> 42:24.640
So go over to linux.ting.com to get started, and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring

42:24.640 --> 42:25.640
Linux Unplugged.

42:25.640 --> 42:28.360
All right, guys, so how about it?

42:28.360 --> 42:32.560
Any plans for mobile support, a Talks mobile client down the road?

42:32.560 --> 42:33.560
Yes.

42:33.560 --> 42:34.560
Well, of course.

42:34.560 --> 42:35.560
Yes.

42:35.560 --> 42:36.560
Yes.

42:36.560 --> 42:37.560
Yes.

42:37.560 --> 42:40.760
I mean, you can't get adopted without support.

42:40.760 --> 42:41.760
Right.

42:41.760 --> 42:42.760
You need to run everywhere.

42:42.760 --> 42:43.760
Yeah.

42:43.760 --> 42:44.760
That's like a must-have.

42:44.760 --> 42:49.360
So are you going to build that app yourself?

42:49.360 --> 42:52.280
No, we already have people building the apps.

42:52.280 --> 42:58.280
We have TCP relays that need to still be added, but that'll help with a lot of mobile connections.

42:58.280 --> 43:05.040
We have apps already done, and there's a Cydia app, and there's an Android app already.

43:05.040 --> 43:10.320
Android doesn't work yet, and the Cydia app needs a special repo, but this is all being

43:10.320 --> 43:12.240
done already.

43:12.240 --> 43:14.080
We'd love to see that on Ubuntu Touch.

43:14.080 --> 43:15.080
I bet.

43:15.080 --> 43:18.440
That would be a really good app, though, right, to have at launch?

43:18.440 --> 43:19.440
Yeah.

43:19.440 --> 43:22.560
And they'd probably get a lot of exposure, too.

43:22.560 --> 43:32.920
Yeah, I know some people within Canonical are very keen on selling Ubuntu Touch on the

43:32.920 --> 43:37.960
fact that it's possible for people to very easily create these kind of secure apps, and

43:37.960 --> 43:47.400
we're not somewhat tainted with the three-letter acronym companies poking our users.

43:47.400 --> 43:48.400
Yes.

43:48.400 --> 43:51.000
I know, Derek Devlin, you had a comment about freelance developers.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.400
I wanted to let you get that in.

43:52.400 --> 43:53.400
Go ahead.

43:53.400 --> 43:54.400
Yeah.

43:54.400 --> 43:59.280
The reason I was talking about freelance developers is even though you guys don't want to compromise

43:59.280 --> 44:07.120
or commit yourselves to a timeline, I guess it will be a way that you allow people to

44:07.120 --> 44:13.960
just come around and say, I want to do this just as my freelance gig.

44:13.960 --> 44:19.400
If someone wants to take the risk of the time and things, do you want those people to be

44:19.400 --> 44:21.040
directly associated with the project?

44:21.040 --> 44:27.520
Do they need to contribute the patches on their own, in their own branch, and then involve

44:27.520 --> 44:28.780
later?

44:28.780 --> 44:33.640
The reason I'm asking this is because, actually, I'm pretty fascinated by your project.

44:33.640 --> 44:38.520
I've actually gone to two universities, and there's quite a lot of papers.

44:38.520 --> 44:43.200
I will be interested, but there's business models on top of this.

44:43.200 --> 44:47.400
That's why I had these questions to you.

44:47.400 --> 44:55.100
If you want to contribute, just come to our IRC channel and tell us.

44:55.100 --> 45:02.240
The only problem with contributing a lot of code, for example, the core is that, well,

45:02.240 --> 45:07.280
the core stuff is very touchy.

45:07.280 --> 45:16.160
It has to be, well, there has to be no security bugs or else, well, some blogger is going

45:16.160 --> 45:17.720
to destroy us.

45:17.720 --> 45:18.720
Yeah.

45:18.720 --> 45:19.720
Yeah.

45:19.720 --> 45:21.720
That's the way that happens.

45:21.720 --> 45:22.720
Yeah.

45:22.720 --> 45:29.080
But I feel you didn't answer my question, sorry, is that, so a developer that I want,

45:29.080 --> 45:33.120
I have a client, that client wants me to implement something.

45:33.120 --> 45:35.080
I'm going to be paid for this.

45:35.080 --> 45:36.640
So where do I go?

45:36.640 --> 45:43.820
Do I go directly to try submit these patches and these new feature with you, or do I do

45:43.820 --> 45:49.200
it for the client on my own branch and then invite them to go meet you once the feature

45:49.200 --> 45:52.240
is done?

45:52.240 --> 45:58.680
You come and see us first to see if we have plans to implement a feature like that very

45:58.680 --> 46:05.720
soon so we know there's no duplicate work and then, well, you just work on your feature

46:05.720 --> 46:10.200
or you, well, you do whatever you want and we'll adjust.

46:10.200 --> 46:11.200
Okay.

46:11.200 --> 46:13.200
All right.

46:13.200 --> 46:18.440
And Crash, you wanted to make a point on the sort of cross-platform adoption we're seeing

46:18.440 --> 46:19.440
already, right?

46:19.440 --> 46:24.800
Yeah, well, I mean, just talking to the guys in the IRC, in the Jupyter Broadcasting IRC

46:24.800 --> 46:28.960
before, there was a guy in there saying there's, you know, that they're wanting it to run on

46:28.960 --> 46:33.960
every platform, like I said, FreeDOS and OS2 and Plan 9 and stuff, but I also noticed that

46:33.960 --> 46:42.240
they said it's GPL and the Free Software Foundation actually wanted to pick them up and make them

46:42.240 --> 46:46.320
like a Free Software Foundation project and they said no because they didn't want to sign

46:46.320 --> 46:53.280
the FSFCLA purely for the fact that then they could have an iOS client as well, which I

46:53.280 --> 47:00.880
thought was a very smart move because the CLA, it's a good thing in many ways, but just

47:00.880 --> 47:07.160
doing that so that they can even have a client for iOS, which it just makes it more ubiquitous

47:07.160 --> 47:09.240
so that everyone can use TOX.

47:09.240 --> 47:10.240
Yeah.

47:10.240 --> 47:11.240
That's interesting.

47:11.240 --> 47:12.240
I thank you.

47:12.240 --> 47:13.240
Thanks for sharing that.

47:13.240 --> 47:16.560
Also, go ahead, STQ, you wanted to respond?

47:16.560 --> 47:18.400
Sorry, I was just testing.

47:18.400 --> 47:21.640
I couldn't see my microphone icon, so I was just making sure.

47:21.640 --> 47:24.840
So Crash, you've been following the project since the beginning.

47:24.840 --> 47:27.800
Did you have any questions you wanted to ask the guys?

47:27.800 --> 47:31.360
Well, not particularly.

47:31.360 --> 47:38.040
I was actually quite interested in what their opinions are of WebRTC as far as the video

47:38.040 --> 47:42.120
part because I thought that might be, I mean, that's more of an idea thing that they want,

47:42.120 --> 47:48.280
but if they built a little in one of the clients, maybe it's a little WebKit engine or something

47:48.280 --> 47:55.440
that can connect to WebRTC, but I don't know if that's P2P or not, so they might not work

47:55.440 --> 47:59.800
with the goals of the project, but it would be an interesting way to do something.

47:59.800 --> 48:03.760
That actually kind of dovetails to a question I was going to ask.

48:03.760 --> 48:07.680
What are your thoughts at this point, maybe this is probably best for I run Gentoo, on

48:07.680 --> 48:09.720
the actual implementation of video support?

48:09.720 --> 48:17.000
Are you looking at things like WebRTC, are you looking at codecs yet and how it's going

48:17.000 --> 48:22.240
to work, resolutions and all these kinds of things, or are you not at that spot yet?

48:22.240 --> 48:30.240
Well, video already works in the core, it's basic, but it works.

48:30.240 --> 48:38.120
Currently it uses VP8, VP9 isn't quite ready, but switching from VP8 to VP9, it's a two-line

48:38.120 --> 48:46.840
change in the code, so it's not really an issue.

48:46.840 --> 48:52.800
First before developing audio video more, we need to get it into clients, because right

48:52.800 --> 48:56.320
now no client really supports it.

48:56.320 --> 49:01.880
We have our test client that supports it, but that's not enough, you want to get some

49:01.880 --> 49:10.560
real testing for it, and once we have some real testing, we can start maybe adding more

49:10.560 --> 49:12.240
stuff to the video.

49:12.240 --> 49:23.720
Right now it's very basic, you set the resolution, then there's no congestion control.

49:23.720 --> 49:29.500
The fact that it's going to be using VP9 down the road and I actually get to set the resolution

49:29.500 --> 49:36.400
already puts it a notch above Skype, my friend, so that's already a good thing.

49:36.400 --> 49:40.720
I know you had a question sort of maybe about the fundamental separation between the core

49:40.720 --> 49:45.560
project and the clients, and maybe that would sort of get around some of these licensing

49:45.560 --> 49:46.560
problems?

49:46.560 --> 49:51.600
Yeah, so there is this problem with the CLA for our Free Software Foundation, but the

49:51.600 --> 49:55.600
way I understand the Free Software Foundation CLA actually ensures that even if the Free

49:55.600 --> 49:59.800
Software Foundation for some reason goes to bankruptcy or fails, a company that takes

49:59.800 --> 50:05.580
over cannot transform the free software, the proprietary software, which at this moment

50:05.580 --> 50:09.680
is something that, I mean, I'm not saying that you guys are going to get bought out,

50:09.680 --> 50:16.640
but it's possible, and the project will just buy from there or go to a different direction.

50:16.640 --> 50:21.480
I see that if the reason is the iOS client, couldn't just the iOS client be completely

50:21.480 --> 50:27.840
separate from the main project and be something that is just kind of, it can be developed

50:27.840 --> 50:30.760
by the same people, just not under the same umbrella?

50:30.760 --> 50:36.040
No, unfortunately everything has to go through our core library to essentially communicate.

50:36.040 --> 50:43.880
Well, our core library is GPL v3, meaning the clients would have to be compatible.

50:43.880 --> 50:47.960
We've been working on making sure we have the copyright for all of our code so we can

50:47.960 --> 50:54.720
selectively assign a dual license for an OSI compatible license so we can allow support

50:54.720 --> 51:01.120
on iOS while still ensuring every client, every library is 100% open source.

51:01.120 --> 51:06.360
Aren't you just recreating a CLA though, if you want to keep the copyright under your

51:06.360 --> 51:09.840
umbrella and everything needing to be through you?

51:09.840 --> 51:10.840
Basically.

51:10.840 --> 51:11.840
Alright.

51:11.840 --> 51:12.840
Okay.

51:12.840 --> 51:20.360
Okay, and one last obligatory question before we wrap up, you guys, how far along is the

51:20.360 --> 51:25.000
Firefox OS version of the Talks Messenger?

51:25.000 --> 51:28.600
That's HTML and JavaScript based, right?

51:28.600 --> 51:31.920
Yeah, actually, what about a web chat, is that possible, is that something you guys

51:31.920 --> 51:32.920
are considering?

51:32.920 --> 51:40.120
Well, I mean, on Chrome OS you can use native client, on web apps you can use native client,

51:40.120 --> 51:45.240
I don't know how you communicate with a C library in Firefox.

51:45.240 --> 51:50.840
Guys, I appreciate the fact, this is really the reason why Talks has moved to the top

51:50.840 --> 51:55.200
of my list right now, is just good desktop support and that promise of replacing Skype

51:55.200 --> 52:00.040
because as somebody, you know, in the podcasting space, a lot of podcasters are very dependent

52:00.040 --> 52:06.320
on this system and it has a lot of limitations and we're not their focus and, you know, you

52:06.320 --> 52:13.160
joke about it, but really just the ability to set the video resolution right now is not

52:13.160 --> 52:17.040
even an option under Skype and if you think about some of the major multi-million dollar

52:17.040 --> 52:21.200
networks out there, TWIT, that are relying on Skype to do video production and you can't

52:21.200 --> 52:26.240
even set the video resolution and that's aside from all of the massive security problems

52:26.240 --> 52:31.720
that Skype now has, thank you Microsoft, and also just the, you know, it's a compromised

52:31.720 --> 52:37.000
piece of software, people DDOS, Skype Nix for joy all the time and it's completely just

52:37.000 --> 52:41.640
messed up, so I'm watching Talks with a lot of interest you guys, so thank you very much

52:41.640 --> 52:44.160
for coming on the show today and chatting with us.

52:44.160 --> 52:50.080
Before we run, I wanted to just get a question out there and it was, I got it in from Scott,

52:50.080 --> 52:55.200
he said, hey guys, I wanted to express a growing concern I have held for the past decade with

52:55.200 --> 53:00.120
open source software and the recent activity things going on in the Linux community right

53:00.120 --> 53:01.120
now.

53:01.120 --> 53:06.240
Examples are Firefox putting ads in, Steam bringing DRM games to Linux, Nvidia proprietary

53:06.240 --> 53:09.480
drivers exploding in popularity, etc.

53:09.480 --> 53:14.240
Linux is always touted as being a free and open system, but are we moving into an era

53:14.240 --> 53:15.840
when less and less is free?

53:15.840 --> 53:18.600
When I talk about free, I mean as in freedom.

53:18.600 --> 53:23.560
The reason I bring this up is because you are very positive of Steam coming to Linux.

53:23.560 --> 53:29.160
He says, in many Linux groups, however, I think some of the sentiment is opposite.

53:29.160 --> 53:32.840
I'm good with paying money for legitimate software, but will the future hold me paying

53:32.840 --> 53:35.400
for software that is not open source?

53:35.400 --> 53:39.480
Do you think as Linux gets more popular and more big players come into the arena, that

53:39.480 --> 53:42.920
the whole open source notion is kind of just a nice dream?

53:42.920 --> 53:44.240
Love to hear what you think.

53:44.240 --> 53:49.600
Scott, anybody in the Mumba room have strong thoughts on this?

53:49.600 --> 53:52.480
I do.

53:52.480 --> 54:00.360
In my opinion anyway, as long as the core components of Linux remain free, so as long

54:00.360 --> 54:06.320
as the kernel and all the intrinsic parts of Linux remain free, that's all that matters.

54:06.320 --> 54:10.640
It's fine if you want to put proprietary software like games on Linux, but as long as the core

54:10.640 --> 54:12.440
components stay free, it's fine.

54:12.440 --> 54:13.440
What do you think Riley?

54:13.440 --> 54:19.480
Yes, this is why there's still things like Trisco Linux and official Free Software Foundation

54:19.480 --> 54:20.480
districts.

54:20.480 --> 54:26.600
So if you're not concerned about it, just use that and leave everybody else alone.

54:26.600 --> 54:27.600
Wow.

54:27.600 --> 54:31.400
Get off my lawn is essentially what Riley is saying.

54:31.400 --> 54:36.480
I think what Scott is kind of saying here is he's worried about the groupthink syndrome

54:36.480 --> 54:45.520
where we all kind of just, as a group, decide that sort of allowing this encroaching intrusions

54:45.520 --> 54:47.000
on freedom is okay.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.920
And so, well, it's just our video driver.

54:48.920 --> 54:50.600
Well, I really need good Wi-Fi.

54:50.600 --> 54:53.840
Okay, well this video game cost them a lot of money to make.

54:53.840 --> 55:00.280
And we keep rationalizing it and every single time we rationalize it to some sort of group

55:00.280 --> 55:05.960
consensus and we all just kind of collectively give up on that particular thing instead of

55:05.960 --> 55:12.720
holding the hardware vendors to actually making an open source GPU driver and things like

55:12.720 --> 55:13.720
that.

55:13.720 --> 55:16.640
So I actually think what Scott's bringing up is something that we all have to just stay

55:16.640 --> 55:17.980
vigilant on.

55:17.980 --> 55:22.400
And I don't think it means that we stop playing Steam games, but at the same time, I look

55:22.400 --> 55:27.040
at it from like a business standpoint and I say, okay, well core infrastructure components

55:27.040 --> 55:32.280
for sustainability, for long-term predictability, and for transparency, those just have to be

55:32.280 --> 55:33.560
open source.

55:33.560 --> 55:38.120
All other things aside, freedom aside, just if I'm going, if my business is going to rely

55:38.120 --> 55:42.800
on this technology, I need to be able to know where the hell that technology is going and

55:42.800 --> 55:47.380
if the person making that technology disappears or gets burnt out, at least I can fork it

55:47.380 --> 55:49.200
and keep it running myself.

55:49.200 --> 55:54.400
That's why people who have their entire server infrastructure or desktop system dependent

55:54.400 --> 55:58.520
on Apple, man, that would make me stay up at night because you never know what Apple's

55:58.520 --> 55:59.520
going to do next.

55:59.520 --> 56:00.700
Are they going to kill the Mac Mini?

56:00.700 --> 56:02.540
Are they going to drop the Ethernet port?

56:02.540 --> 56:05.160
Are they going to release iOS for the desktop?

56:05.160 --> 56:06.160
It would drive me crazy.

56:06.160 --> 56:07.160
Are they going to make a trash can?

56:07.160 --> 56:12.160
Yeah, I mean, are they going to drop all PCI Express expandability and internal storage?

56:12.160 --> 56:13.720
You just never know.

56:13.720 --> 56:17.840
Whereas with open technology, you at least have the mailing list, you have the roadmap

56:17.840 --> 56:20.080
and you have that almighty fork.

56:20.080 --> 56:24.680
And I think for core infrastructure technology, and that's, you know, you could argue with

56:24.680 --> 56:28.400
the GPU driver and that's one of the reasons I've been eyeballing Ultra Pro because I kind

56:28.400 --> 56:33.000
of like the idea of getting an Iris GPU just to make one more component less dependent

56:33.000 --> 56:34.880
on some upstream vendor.

56:34.880 --> 56:42.320
But I think it is appropriate and I believe it is rational, even with all of that considered,

56:42.320 --> 56:49.760
to make exceptions and where certain practical matters come in, like in some cases video

56:49.760 --> 56:55.080
editing or in some cases video games, you know, I think commercial can be accepted.

56:55.080 --> 56:57.480
I mean, Matt, this is probably something you've struggled with for a long time.

56:57.480 --> 56:58.480
Where do you fall down?

56:58.480 --> 57:01.640
You know, I think at the end of the day, it comes down to the point you were making about

57:01.640 --> 57:02.840
core components and that sort of thing.

57:02.840 --> 57:06.200
I think as long as it stays out of the kitchen as far as getting really deep into stuff,

57:06.200 --> 57:09.120
I don't think this is really such an issue because for years there's always been the

57:09.120 --> 57:13.240
concern of this becoming a major, major catastrophe and oh my God, it's the end of Linux as we

57:13.240 --> 57:15.640
know it because of this and that and the other thing.

57:15.640 --> 57:20.320
As long as we have distributions that are able to maintain those core components pure,

57:20.320 --> 57:23.360
you know, if one distro wants to go south or something, that's their business.

57:23.360 --> 57:26.040
I don't see this being a big problem, I guess is what I'm trying to say.

57:26.040 --> 57:27.040
I really don't.

57:27.040 --> 57:29.800
Yeah, and it's kind of, it's come and gone over the years.

57:29.800 --> 57:32.120
Like in some ways it's actually gotten better.

57:32.120 --> 57:37.500
Like there's a lot, these days a lot of systems actually have a lot less binary blobs powering

57:37.500 --> 57:38.500
that hardware.

57:38.500 --> 57:39.500
True.

57:39.500 --> 57:46.320
I mean there's still a few, you know, but there was a time when I got a Red Hat, jeez,

57:46.320 --> 57:50.920
I mean it was, I think it was back before Fedora core was even a thing.

57:50.920 --> 57:57.120
So I want to say like Red Hat 6 and I had a binary driver for the Adaptek or some sort

57:57.120 --> 57:58.120
of SCSI controller.

57:58.120 --> 58:03.120
I had a binary driver for the network card because it was a special network card to communicate

58:03.120 --> 58:07.120
with an IBM system 390 mainframe, right?

58:07.120 --> 58:11.160
And then it ran on top of it a proprietary management software to monitor and manage

58:11.160 --> 58:14.000
it, which has now been completely replaced with things like Puppet.

58:14.000 --> 58:21.320
And so in some ways, while we have Steam and we have Nvidia binary drivers, in other ways

58:21.320 --> 58:25.360
we are actually working with a lot more free software.

58:25.360 --> 58:30.040
And as the technology landscape moves forward and there's less entrenched interest in these

58:30.040 --> 58:35.000
certain areas, like there used to be a big market around creating server SCSI adapters

58:35.000 --> 58:41.080
and you wouldn't even use the adapter that came with the box on the motherboard, you'd

58:41.080 --> 58:45.160
never use that, you'd always use an external adapter and you'd have to have the driver

58:45.160 --> 58:48.280
and you'd have to build the module for that version of your kernel, you couldn't update

58:48.280 --> 58:52.520
your kernel and you were really stuck and that's not even a problem anymore.

58:52.520 --> 58:56.900
Now those guys work directly with Upstream and those drivers ship with the kernel and

58:56.900 --> 59:00.680
they're open source and it's just, you don't even have to worry about it, the drives just

59:00.680 --> 59:05.540
show up now to your system and you know, you kids, you don't even appreciate what old farts

59:05.540 --> 59:06.760
used to have to deal with.

59:06.760 --> 59:09.960
So in a lot of ways, Scott, I actually think it's gotten a lot better too.

59:09.960 --> 59:14.740
I think we are always looking at the individual trees, but if you were to fly up like Superman

59:14.740 --> 59:18.520
above that forest, you'd see that a lot of it actually isn't that bad.

59:18.520 --> 59:19.520
That's my take on it.

59:19.520 --> 59:23.840
All right, Matt, well so we're going to wrap up here on Linux Unplugged.

59:23.840 --> 59:27.800
Thank you big time to the Tox developers for joining us today, it was very fascinating chat

59:27.800 --> 59:31.320
and good to get their perspective on some of the things and kind of get an idea where

59:31.320 --> 59:32.320
they're going.

59:32.320 --> 59:36.000
Look, on Sunday on the Linux Action Show, I'm going to review that Chromebook, that

59:36.000 --> 59:42.240
Acer C720 and I'm going to try to answer the question, can a Chromebook running Linux,

59:42.240 --> 59:45.920
not Chrome OS, but actual full-fledged Linux, can you get decent battery life, what's the

59:45.920 --> 59:50.020
performance like and is it actually something that's worth spending money on or should you

59:50.020 --> 59:52.480
just stick with Chrome OS or maybe get a tablet, something like that.

59:52.480 --> 59:54.120
We'll try to answer those questions on Sunday.

59:54.120 --> 59:57.400
If you've got any questions, feel free to send them in, we can start a thread over at

59:57.400 --> 01:00:02.440
linuxactionshow.reddit.com, you can post them there and we'll try to get to those questions

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.000
in Sunday's Linux Action Show.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.520
All right, Matt, we'll have a great week, okay?

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.520
You too.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.520
I'll see you on Sunday and thank you everyone for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.000
If we don't see you on Sunday for the Linux Action Show, I hope we'll see you right back

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
here next Tuesday.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Bye-bye.
