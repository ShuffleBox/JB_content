1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
So Wes, what do you think of this concept of Linux speedruns? Oh, I'm hooked. I love it

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,240
I mean, I don't know if I'm up for it without reading some manuals first, but I like the idea

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,500
It wasn't it wasn't our idea. It was a post over at Rachel by the bay calm

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,480
She's blogged quite a few times and this one caught our attention because well, honestly

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,740
It's kind of a neat just idea on the surface

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,680
you start with a minimal system and then get yourself to the point where you can do something meaningful like I

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,580
Don't know download a picture from reddit or get in the IRC chat room like no nano no VI

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,040
Maybe you get cat

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,240
Okay, but you know certainly nothing like net cat or FTP or Ruby or Python or any of it?

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,160
Can you build yourself up from a bare bones Linux? Yeah, you could do that or another speedrun example could be like go through a testing

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,840
spree and

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,080
Test the latest Ubuntu release or test the latest fedora and see how fast you can spin them up

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,320
But go through a sequence of things and if you discover a bug report it and time yourself

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,900
I wouldn't mind doing some arch install speedruns. I think we have West

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,280
Hello friends and welcome to episode

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,260
349 of your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hey there, Wes. Hello looking great today

17
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry about the plexiglass between us social distancing you understand. Yeah, that's alright. I've got this nice suit on them

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,320
It's comfortable. Yeah, I'm actually impressed. It hasn't affected your audio quality

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,200
It's a special fabric. The mask is a little distracting West we have

20
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,440
One of these episodes that it felt really appropriate. We're gonna do something. You should never do today

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,360
Don't do what Wes and Chris are going to do. We're gonna build a server like you should not this is not a how-to episode

22
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,800
We're going to expose a server to the public internet open up a telnet port and have you pound on it to prove the scalability

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,840
Of a piece of hardware that we're going to be abusing in this demonstration. I think it's gonna be a lot of fun

24
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,840
but we have of course our

25
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,740
Steak and potatoes as well like community news and our virtual log time appropriate greetings mumble room. Hello. Hello

26
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:15,320
Happy happy Linux Tuesday. Happy Linux Tuesday everybody. Nice to see you back in there poppy

27
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,160
Hello Brent has been a little bit for you, too

28
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,640
And we have a great lineup there is 31 of our virtual lug in there right now. Wow, it's pretty great

29
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,720
We love you all. Yeah, it's really nice to see you there. We had we had a really fun pre-show over at JB live TV

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,600
We do the show on Tuesdays at noon Pacific, but you can get that converted at Jupiter broadcasting comm

31
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,200
Calendar, so let's start out with a little community news before we get into abusing hardware around here

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,880
there's a couple of stories that caught our attention and so this wasn't was

33
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,320
a partially inspired by our weekend activities

34
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,680
It's a little steam update. It's been a while since we've had one of these it has it has in part

35
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,840
It's both news and our weekend. It looks like really nice improvements for the 80 AMD

36
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,080
Easy for me to say radion graphic driver in version 5.8 of your Linux kernel will be landing

37
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,240
That'll be a good one lots of nice fixes in there and then also Nvidia just pushed out a new update

38
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:18,640
That helps improve some recent game releases run on proton, which I thought was just noteworthy because

39
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,640
Nvidia is specifically updating their driver to support proton now. Yeah, right

40
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,240
I think a lot of this is for doom eternal and wow

41
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:33,640
I mean something there's users complaining and Nvidia is actually being receptive. I guess I mean, this is like what is it?

42
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,720
This is how it works on Windows. This is weird. This isn't this is just awkward. I think first class

43
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,440
Yeah, so that's in the Nvidia version four dot four zero dot eight two stable long-lived

44
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,320
Quote-unquote Linux driver a Michael Arbel over at for Onyx has some really good coverage

45
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,720
But I think I just want to take a moment and check in with you guys because I know myself Wes and cheese have all

46
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
Been playing some proton games recently

47
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
before we get to that

48
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:06,140
Popey mentioned some really interesting data on a buntu podcast just some numbers that he noticed when they covered it on a recent episode

49
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:12,300
About the difference in graphics card usage. So yeah, I was reading the article and digging into the

50
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,700
Usual Steam survey and it struck me just how many

51
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:22,660
Machines in the Steam survey run Nvidia GPUs and I know it's anecdotally

52
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:28,300
We talk about how popular Nvidia is but I hear a lot in the community people saying I am D is trouncing

53
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,020
Nvidia and AMD is way more popular and they got much higher sales figures, but then when you look at the stats

54
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:39,700
It's nothing like it. There's way more like multiple more Nvidia cards than there are

55
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,240
AMD cards and in fact

56
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,260
There are more people with integrated Intel cards than there are AMD cards according to the steam stats if I'm reading them correctly

57
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:57,460
That's how I've read them too. I just assume it's people that are super casual gaming playing card games and simple games and hey

58
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,060
I'll raise my hand. I'm one of them. There's not many the Intel graphics will do for me

59
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:07,460
But there are some that's really interesting and I guess it's the video cards you have right sort of the reign of the default there

60
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,380
It just struck me that I would have expected there to be some parity there

61
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:18,460
I would have expected Nvidia and AMD to go toe-to-toe and have a similar spread of GPUs

62
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:25,300
Across the board from super high-end ones that you know, the real gamers have down to the low-end entry-level ones

63
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,900
But it really wasn't like that. It's just Nvidia from top to bottom and then a couple of AMD and a few Intel cards in there

64
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:37,180
It's really fast. It's worth a look. You really really should go and dig into those theme stats. Sometimes they're quite fascinating

65
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,860
What would your bet be for a year down the road?

66
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,340
Much the same. I

67
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,880
Don't see that everyone's gonna suddenly throw away like however many I can't remember the numbers

68
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,860
But it was something like of the top 40 cards in the list

69
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,860
60% or so were Nvidia

70
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,980
I can't see that many people throwing away their Nvidia cards and replacing them with with AMD overnight

71
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,500
I just can't see it. It'll be a long transition

72
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,220
If so, it's more like a next build do you think about it?

73
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,460
And if AMD is still really kicking butt then then that's probably the route you go

74
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,660
Well, you can also pick up a 2080 right now. I think for right around five six hundred dollars

75
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:20,140
So, you know that was a fourteen hundred dollar card six eight months ago. Yeah, yikes

76
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,460
I'll take one if you're buying cheese. Yeah cheese if you want to yeah God dang

77
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:31,060
That is I I would need to see hard data that proves that you have any real advantage with those cards under Linux

78
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:36,220
I will I will couch that same perhaps maybe under Windows in certain circumstances for sure

79
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,860
But I'm just not really sure if Linux games are fully taking advantage of it

80
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,780
I'd love to see the data that says they are if you're gonna invest

81
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,540
$600

82
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:52,020
Just you could buy a whole computer for that and play on the graphics that it comes with and maybe not notice a huge difference

83
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,620
I know that's old man Chris speaking, but but that frame rate Chris the frame rate

84
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:01,740
So I've been playing over the weekend Batman Arkham City on proton and it's pretty good

85
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,940
It's I I really actually don't have any complaints even on the e GPU. It's worked pretty well

86
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,820
I've only played for about two hours. So I don't have a ton of experience. So perhaps it gets I don't know

87
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,840
Maybe it doesn't work. Well, but this one's rated as gold on proton DB

88
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840
So I think that's to take it works pretty good

89
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,740
Some people have had some crashes

90
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:27,140
I have not but I love love love the amount of games that are available now via proton and when I spent a

91
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,760
month on the Mac about a month ago now

92
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:37,460
I was shocked that the Mac has such a crappy game selection, which I believe there's actually more steam users using the Mac

93
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,660
But there's when you consider proton

94
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:47,820
Way more games available for Linux and then when you add the fact that you can get a much wider range of gaming hardware

95
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,100
Yeah, you're not just stuck on whatever man yeah, yeah

96
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,820
It's way better on the Linux platform despite what the numbers may what a weird switch of scenario. It really is

97
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:03,620
It's it's I mean fantastic. Yeah, totally. So what have you been playing? I'm playing risk of rain, too

98
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:08,460
Well, I started off playing some tabletop simulator, which I'm pleased to note does have a native Linux built

99
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,100
Which worked beautifully. I hadn't had steam installed for a while

100
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,320
I like gaming but I'm very much a casual gamer when I have time, you know

101
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,580
And as many folks are doing these days

102
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:23,780
I was having a virtual video hangout with some folks and they were all gonna start playing I'd never played risk of rain 2 before

103
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,940
It's a third-person shooter roguelike a lot of fun lots of fun enemies to shoot and kill super fun

104
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:35,180
Yeah, and I was like, okay. Well, it's been a while since I tried proton. It's has platinum support over on proton TV

105
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,860
Let's give it a go. Yeah, when you said you tried it and I looked it up on proton DB

106
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,020
I said, oh so you must have had no problem playing this

107
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,180
So this is where me being a little bit of a newbie to proton. Maybe wasn't the best. I had just reinstalled steam

108
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,320
I'd you know installed everything I needed to go along with it

109
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,680
I tried a couple other proton games and that worked this one the launcher would load up

110
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,320
We'll scroll bar going, you know loading the game and then nothing just it even even sometimes it would say it was running

111
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,480
But nothing showing up on my screen

112
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,940
So I had to go dig in and try to enable logging and still nothing and eventually I found some post somewhere that

113
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,400
Reminded me I didn't I didn't have the Mesa Vulcan drivers. Oh, yeah, so one little package and then it was perfect

114
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,040
yeah, and some distributions make that a little more discoverable than others and there's other ways of

115
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,360
Installing it that sometimes pull in some of those dependencies, right?

116
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,720
Yeah, in this case, I was just installing steam right out of it. But so once that got

117
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,400
No complaints at all and it even ran on this ThinkPad right here with integrated graphics

118
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,040
I mean I did turn the settings down a little bit, but that was fine worked on the Intel chip, huh?

119
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,440
that's right, so you're one of those numbers there and

120
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,920
Like me your experience was probably like you would have no idea. This is a

121
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,920
Not at all didn't have to mess around with wine or bottles or any of that nonsense. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

122
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,840
I know I love it so much. So what about you cheesy? What are you been playing? Is it on proton? Yeah, it's on proton

123
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
It's platinum level. It's raft

124
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,600
Essentially you float around on a raft try not to get eaten by a shark and you can play with I think up to four

125
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,960
people no

126
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,760
This sounds great

127
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,320
It's a super fun game

128
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,920
you build out your raft and you kind of float to these different islands and then eventually you can unlock a

129
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:19,680
Radio that'll allow you to get beacons so you can direct toward different islands and you essentially just pick up ocean trash the entire game

130
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,640
And build your raft with it. It's a really fun game

131
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,840
works right out of the box. I haven't had any issues any crashes or anything like that running on top of a rx-580 and

132
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,960
It's it's it's a super fun game. I played on with you know for hours on end with it and

133
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,480
Never had any issues. You know what I'm thinking is we need to do a game sesh between you me and Dylan and

134
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,400
You know get a little raft going this sounds like something he'd love game on. That was his birthday today

135
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,880
His birthday today happy birthday Dylan Dylan turns 11 years old Wow

136
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,960
which the thing that really blows my mind about that is

137
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,960
It was right around when he was born that I was like, I'm going serious with with the whole podcasting thing

138
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,160
So it's been 11 years since it's been my full-time job

139
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,180
11 years full-time podcasting. Can you believe that that doesn't seem and in his world is totally normal, right?

140
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,040
He's grown up with that like oh, yeah, my pops just a full-time podcaster. Yeah, he's got it

141
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,640
Yeah, he's got this building we go to this his studio for podcasting. It's really it's really kind of it's kind of remarkable and

142
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,760
He and I have been loving loving playing games via Steam on his laptop and I have it on my laptop and it's just been

143
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,360
Awesome. So I'm really pleased with the state of proton

144
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,460
I know there was some issues around like a development capacity for it

145
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,460
But so far it really seems to be kicking ass and now

146
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,760
Both AMD and Nvidia are spending resources on development time to make games work

147
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,900
It's it's not perfect. It's not native games. It's not the ideal scenario

148
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,640
But you'd be surprised how often weird abstraction layers like this exist in the gaming industry

149
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,760
I mean, it's one it's just it's just very technically clever

150
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,680
I'm very impressed with the work and two

151
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,520
I mean it might be a good long-term play in the sense of alright

152
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,500
Well, once you start seeing how many folks on Linux are willing to play these games once they work

153
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,860
That's some good data for perhaps more native games down the line. So some really good game suggestions, too

154
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,000
I really have been enjoying Batman Arkham City. It's it's a little bit on rails

155
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,520
But at the same time you can fly around Arkham City and it gives you the instructions

156
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,280
You need to feel like you're playing the game like a competent person when you're not necessarily

157
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,220
So I like it if you're not of a serious as a gamer

158
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:33,040
Risk of rain 2 was Wes's that looks like a lot of frickin fun and then raft which I'm installing after the show cheese

159
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,400
There will have links to their proton pages and stuff in the show notes at Linux unplug calm slash

160
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,600
349 if you've got any great picks yourself. Why not? Give us an email when it's unplug calm slash contact now

161
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,440
There's some news that just broke that poppy brought to our attention before we hit record that Wes and I are still chewing on and it's

162
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:58,680
Github's huge announcement that it is now free for teams Nat Friedman writes on the github blog

163
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,680
We're happy to announce we're making private repositories

164
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,840
with unlimited collaborators

165
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:11,280
Available to all github accounts all of the core of github features are now free for everyone to use

166
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,720
This means teams can now manage their work together in one place

167
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,560
CICD project management code review packages all that and actually a whole lot more

168
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,880
We want everyone to be able to ship great software on the platform developers love

169
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,440
So this also very practically means I'm no longer paying a subscription for private repositories

170
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,280
Yeah, you got a free plan now, but yo

171
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,400
But you spotted a comment that Nat Friedman made about this on hacker news, which I think adds some context to this

172
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,880
Yeah, he wrote

173
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,960
We've wanted to make this change for the last 18 months

174
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,440
But needed and this parts key needed our enterprise business to be big enough to enable the free use of github

175
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,720
By the rest of the world in general. We think that every developer on earth should be able to use github for their work

176
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,360
So it's great to remove that as a barrier. Is it a strategic move computer kid?

177
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,600
That would make sense since they are very competitive

178
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:13,800
Since Microsoft bought github get lab has been kind of gaining more users since a lot of people aren't trusting

179
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,320
Microsoft and moving over to get lab. So it would make sense that they're trying to

180
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,360
Get another one up

181
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,840
It seems like a competitive move against get lab and just at the end of last month get lab moved a bunch of stuff

182
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,200
You know that had previously been in there their private version over to the the free version

183
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:38,280
There's also some good comparisons in that same hacker news thread around what things you might you know the difference between what what's free and get

184
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,360
Lab what's free and github?

185
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,680
So there's still some reasons you might choose one over the other and I'll also note there's been some

186
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,800
Some nuances here as there always are sure it's cheaper now

187
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,400
but for instance used to get if you had this this old pro plan you got a certain number of action minutes for the

188
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,440
New github actions and on the free one while you get less and it turns out to get back to that same amount

189
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,560
You probably have to pay two times the price. So great news in general

190
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,600
Go check it out for whatever your particular needs are

191
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,740
I think bitmux you make a good point that it's in Microsoft's interest for a lot of their other

192
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,780
Ancillary service to get as many people using github as possible. Yeah, I was just thinking about it

193
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:20,200
It's like well, we host code and we solve problems and we sell software and it's like I have a problem

194
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,240
I think I'd like to see if there's a solution for it. Oh, I'll check my own product

195
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,880
Good github. I'll look to see if somebody solved this problem for me and they're they're already been doing that for years and years

196
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,160
But now they own the platform and so if they can bring the entirety of the world's development brainpower

197
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,600
Under their under their roof. They'll take that. Thank you very much

198
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,720
You could also say that this is a win for the open source community to some regard too because I mean this now allows

199
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:51,080
teams and you know to possibly develop applications together where they might not have

200
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,540
Been able to do that otherwise or just couldn't afford the four bucks the nine bucks a month to do so. So I

201
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,260
mean

202
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,700
I see it as kind of a positive move, but I can also see the Microsoft aspect as well

203
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,520
And I've been following the whole github and gitlab thing for a while now

204
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,660
So I don't think that that debates ever gonna go away personally, right?

205
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:16,900
I mean, there's always the issue of it's easier now to use a proprietary platform and that is good and maybe a little bit bad

206
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,020
too, yeah, but it does ultimately mean there's gonna be

207
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,700
Probably more software developed and published online. That's more accessible to more

208
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,180
So that's good. Seems like totally kind of a net win because it makes

209
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:37,060
Get lab more competitive. It makes github more competitive. It's kind of a win-win and I also know

210
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,060
You know some of the folks over it get lab jumped in the comments, too

211
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,460
Of course, and it does seem like it's a friendly rival. You know, they're not out to get each other

212
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,800
No one's slashing throats here. It's they're both making great products. There's use cases for everything and

213
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,500
Thankfully, it's all powered by git. It's true. All right

214
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:57,520
Well, let's look a little head because just around the corner is the release of a buntu

215
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,000
20 Oh for we're cooking up a review right now

216
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
weeks in the making

217
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,880
Going deep on this one. The current target release date is April 23rd

218
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:16,720
2020 so it's coming up just next week. So your Linux unplugged program will likely have its review next week for you right on the nose

219
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,320
It's gonna feature Linux 5.4. And why your card is essentially

220
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,680
Pre plumbed at least the holes are dug right West you actually got it going on 24 pretty easily

221
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,240
Yeah, I mean the modules already ready for you

222
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,880
So just you know mod for a wire garden away you go and then the you know

223
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:40,360
The tools the wire guard tools package is just an apt install away. Yes, that's nice. It's right there in the repo also

224
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,160
The snapshot system that's built into the ZFS file system that happens like every time you install a package

225
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:55,220
things like that has seen a nice couple of tweaks including one that makes it much much much quicker to

226
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,040
Go through the list of possible snapshots in grub

227
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,640
and the way this works is you have just an entry in grub you select that and

228
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,400
That will have all of the previous snapshots which you can boot from and we're talking a pretty dramatic

229
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,560
like a hundred

230
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,840
Seconds sometimes for something to load so well over a minute. What's wrong with my computer?

231
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,600
Why won't it boom and now it's near instantaneous?

232
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,560
Which is pretty great and I got some hands-on experience with that which I'll try to include in my review next week

233
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,560
So it's coming pretty close Wes. I know I mean, you know still

234
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,760
Experimental and ext4 is of course the default file system still but from when this option first appeared

235
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,180
I'm really impressed and it's it really I think points the way to the glorious snapshot future that we might all have

236
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,640
And probably I believe the testing week just wrapped up. That seems like it was pretty well attended pretty well utilized

237
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:52,220
That was great. It was a community organized test week. We you know, we always have these test weeks, but we don't often have

238
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,460
as much visibility and as many people participating and use of Phillips who's

239
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,900
active in the ability community decided to take the bull by the horns and

240
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,700
Did a whole lot of promotion invited a whole load of people from all the different ability flavors

241
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,140
So the XFC flavors of one two and come on two and so on get them all on board

242
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,900
so they all promoted it individually as a central effort and

243
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,500
loads of people joined in and started testing this thing and we got a whole bunch of

244
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,500
bugs reported as a result because you know who knew software has bugs and

245
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:31,860
Put more work on the desktop team before the release a week before the release whoopsie, but yeah, it's really good

246
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:37,340
It's really really good. It's a model that others could follow. I I love there was community started too. That's really great

247
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,540
That's super cool. So we'll give you our take on that next week now

248
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,900
before we get to

249
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:50,140
Exposing our telnet server to the internet and releasing the hounds onto it

250
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,320
We do have just a little bit of housekeeping

251
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,820
So I start with some unfortunate news

252
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,780
This week you may have heard that we have ended the production

253
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,460
immediately of Linux action news

254
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,460
choose Linux and

255
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,380
user air which

256
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,580
Really stings because I was a personal favorite podcast of mine. It just hurts. I loved user air

257
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,140
but after a

258
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:21,060
lengthy internal investigation a cloud guru management who owns

259
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,900
The podcast Jupiter broadcasting who we are all employed by

260
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,580
Determined that they had no choice but to terminate

261
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:36,500
Joe Resington's contract with a cloud guru, which means he'll no longer be on any Jupiter broadcasting podcasts or

262
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,180
employed by a cloud guru effective

263
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,300
Immediately, so the ramifications of that are obviously pretty dramatic

264
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:51,980
Not only do we have to immediately cease production on some shows which I've worked on and essentially for 14 years like Linux action news

265
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,940
but it also

266
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,940
Does have an impact on this show?

267
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,980
Joe joined us. I think in the spring of 2018

268
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,160
Took our audio from amateur to pro, you know

269
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,240
It's when we went from a mixed to stereo track where everybody was talking over each other

270
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,480
No edits right to multi-track polished sinking it up. You can tell I mean if you go back and listen to the archive

271
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
You can tell immediately

272
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,260
It's just I couldn't get it across the line on my own and I mean it wasn't just that I mean

273
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,840
You know all the care he had for the audio the mastering the mixing that the sound

274
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,920
But also the behind-the-scenes the production work the critiques of things we did wrong input on topics

275
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:35,280
Mm-hmm. Yeah, so his mark will always be on the show and on that on that ring of shows that he had there

276
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,680
But moving forward drew will be editing and I can genuinely say he's a fantastic editor

277
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,440
it may sound slightly different, but I think it'll still sound great knowing drew it will and

278
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,800
He if you've heard him on choose Linux, you've heard him on this show

279
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,180
He's another one of these exceptional assets to our team much like Joe was

280
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,460
and

281
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:01,460
Drew will be taking over the editing of the show and I I have confidence in his ability completely

282
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:06,620
but I just personally want to thank Joe for his time one of the things that he did that was special for the show is

283
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,740
He worked and an unrealistic schedule that

284
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,060
Meant that he was up until 4 or 5 a.m. To work on the show

285
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,740
So that way we could get it out Tuesday night or Wednesday morning for people's commute

286
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:24,660
You can't just ask someone to shift their timezone eight hours. Yeah, and he did it so that way the audience got the show as fast

287
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,140
as possible in the best quality as possible and

288
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:32,600
I think that's been something that we're gonna try to continue to do. You know, it's of course within

289
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,540
Expectations of the team's capability now, but one one advantage that drew has is he's not in London

290
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,700
He is he is actually here in the States. So

291
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:46,100
That will help time zone wise but Joe made a statement on late night Linux

292
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,140
Which I recommend you go check out at late night Linux

293
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:54,860
Go go subscribe in your favorite podcast catcher because it's a great show anyways, but he covers it right there

294
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,860
He says all that really needs to be said in

295
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:02,820
That episode so go check that out for his statement. I mean, I think there's not much more that can be said to it

296
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,900
Right. That is just what it is

297
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:10,500
And I will be putting my focus from what I did some of the time I spent on Linux action news

298
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,660
into the show

299
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:17,060
One other adjustment that is happening is we are reducing the cadence of Linux headlines

300
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,540
from every weekday to Monday Wednesday Friday and

301
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:27,700
Some of the news that would have gone into LAN will go into headlines. So we'll just sort of divvy up some of that work and

302
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,620
That is the state of things for now

303
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:36,940
The plan is to keep trying to invest as much as we can in fact make Linux unplugged bigger and better than ever and that's our

304
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,940
focus now going forward and

305
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:45,460
I hope you will keep subscribed Linux unplugged comm slash subscribe and join us for the next series of episodes like

306
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,260
You know as a team, we're just really trying to kind of put it all together still. It's still new for us, too. Mm-hmm

307
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:55,580
I was not involved in the decision process. So I found out after it was official and

308
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:02,700
Just kind of dealing with it as as we can and that's true for all of us. Yeah, so we're sorry

309
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,420
It was you know, it's it's quick. Sometimes things go that way

310
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,980
It's not how we would have planned it, but that's the world we live in. Yeah, that's that

311
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,260
You know

312
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,900
We are our intention is always and always will be to try to give you as much notice before we wrap up a show

313
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:19,700
But one of the things I've learned about the media business is sometimes that it just does not work that way despite your best

314
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:26,580
Intentions and I felt that way super strongly since the finale of Star Trek Voyager. Yes, right

315
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:32,340
That was that is that is when I learned an important lesson that you need to brace yourself for the end of something you've been

316
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:37,700
listening to or watching every week and from that moment, which is what 2001?

317
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,620
I don't know from that moment forward. It has been a core belief of mine

318
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,980
So we always will strive to give you as much heads up as possible. Sometimes it is outside our control though a

319
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,740
little bit of good news though

320
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,920
Our good friend Heather from side bite has rejoined us for a very special extra the resilience of the Voyagers

321
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:01,300
These things were built to last the Voyager probes 42 years in county

322
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:08,580
They probably won't be lasting much longer. In fact, we're about to enter a very crucial period where we will be dismantling some of these

323
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,740
Infrastructures that are on the planets. Yeah, the big old radio telescopes

324
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,740
so we will not be able to communicate and

325
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,860
It's all detailed in the resilience of the Voyagers about how they were built about some of the special things about them

326
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:25,020
I tell you what with everything going on right now. There was something about that episode. I found super inspirational

327
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,580
So that's at extras dot show slash 70 right on the nose

328
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:35,900
So great to talk to Heather again, too. She's the best so you gotta give that a go give that a go and then I want

329
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:41,000
I want to also give a plug for something that's pretty neat that's developing in the community right now

330
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:48,280
It's the luck plug our virtual lug is also assembling an extra day in the week on Sunday

331
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:54,300
Sunday at noon Pacific that's when we would normally do the show our regular live time, but on Sunday

332
00:25:54,300 --> 00:26:00,900
This Sunday myself and cheese are gonna try to make in attendance. I think I'll be talking a little bit more about the hardware device

333
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,740
We're using today. That's gonna be something I'd like to talk about

334
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,940
I guess they did it last Sunday and they were saying it went for hours

335
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,420
You know people come and go as they can so it's a virtual lug on the weekend

336
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:17,660
If you can't make it on a Tuesday, the virtual lug is assembling on the mumble spot. You same spot same bat time

337
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,220
It's just different bat day. And if you google search Jupiter colony mumble

338
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,060
you'll get all of the information on how to connect just get mumble installed from your repo and

339
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,300
Except the fact that the certificate has expired apparently

340
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,900
I love that. We have another great reason to get the mumble set up

341
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,860
You know like join the lug hang out and then you'll be ready to go for today

342
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,540
I mean, I'm gonna be doing it maybe with like a sparkly beverage with my feet up at the RV

343
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:44,620
I think that's how I'm gonna do it. It's gonna be like totally chillax. Well, and I love that

344
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:50,140
This is spawned out of the community. So the community thought hey, let's get together and just have a have a lug

345
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:56,020
And I think this will be a great opportunity for everybody to learn a few little things and from the the sounds of it

346
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:01,740
There's no itinerary. It's just free-flowing. So everybody will get a chance to chime in. Sounds like a fun time

347
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,500
It's just nice to chat with other people that know what you're talking about when you're talking about Linux stuff

348
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,540
That's just that's just a great rewarding conversation. It'll be in the lobby of our mumble server

349
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:16,860
So again, just google search Jupiter colony mumble or join the geek shed IRC IRC geek shed net

350
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:21,340
There is now a hashtag lup lug geek shed channel

351
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,580
That'll be going all the time. So IRC geek shed net hashtag

352
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:30,620
lup lug and people in there probably help you get connected to the mumble room if you have any problems

353
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:37,980
How great is that? Fantastic and it's just a quick mention for our telegram group at Jupiter broadcasting comm telegram

354
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:43,260
That is the persistent universe of this podcast. That is where the conversation continues

355
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:48,780
Even when the podcast is not being produced or released as well as conversations around the network

356
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,100
Jupiter broadcasting comm telegram

357
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,100
The persistent universe, you know, it's like an MMO but only chatting

358
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:02,860
Something like that. So we're gonna do something that you really should never do. We are going to build

359
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,660
what we think is

360
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,420
near

361
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:15,020
Ideal pine 64 rock pro 64 server grade setup. And I think this could be a candidate for

362
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:21,180
Just about anyone's home server anyone who needs to maybe run some plaques some network monitoring

363
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:26,780
Maybe a little authentication some name resolution some ad blocking. Maybe you want a self-hosted wiki

364
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:33,980
Maybe a little home assistant all of these things on one device that takes 12 volts of power

365
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,300
I mean, we know you've been a little bit obsessed with these, you know, I mean computer boards with arm

366
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:44,540
You've got raspberry pies, I think basically everywhere in your I do and I was I really like the raspberry pie because it feels

367
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:49,660
Like a platform that is well supported with a community around it, right tons of guides tons of images

368
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:55,660
I think and you guys correct me if i'm wrong, but I think the second to that now has become the pine 64 boards

369
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,380
You know, i'm happy to see that you're kind of

370
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:04,300
Now falling into this addiction for single board computers. I've been dealing with this for quite some time now

371
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:08,940
My shelf is full of these boards. But man, the rock pro board is one of the best boards out there right now

372
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:14,860
A great great little machine. I'll tell you what put me over the top on it is it has a pci express slot

373
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:19,420
So let that sink in for a second express by far man pci 4x

374
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,260
and

375
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,100
That meant that you could put a gigabit nick in there

376
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:30,700
You could put a sata expansion card in there or you could do like we did again

377
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:35,340
Not recommending you do this, but you could do like we did and you could get an mvm

378
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,340
e

379
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:41,180
pci adapter that will take an mvme drive and

380
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,220
Click it right into that pci slot

381
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,780
And then you're doing

382
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:51,660
Like real data transfer speeds, right? I mean so this has been sitting around on the shelf for a little while

383
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:56,220
We hadn't had a chance to really check it out yet. And so of course when we first booted it up on the sd card

384
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,060
well

385
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,620
It was slow. I mean it felt almost

386
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,820
Somewhat perceptibly faster than the raspberry pi, but that's a hard thing to quantify at the command line

387
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,740
It didn't really seem significantly better

388
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:15,740
And then you combine that with the network effect and community effect or the raspberry pi and you start to think well, maybe a right

389
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,020
I mean, you know, you have to find different images. There's like a you know, that's a little bit of a

390
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,660
Process and they're you know custom builds from members in the community

391
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:27,020
And on top of all of that, how do you tell performance when everything's waiting on the desk? So the rock pro

392
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,100
64 is special in a couple of ways. It has

393
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:37,920
ddr4 ram lpd ddr4 ram so it's faster ram than what's on the raspberry pi. It has gigabit ethernet

394
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,220
It has an emmc module slot

395
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,020
It has a full-size 4k support hdmi video out

396
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,540
It has usb 3 it has usb 2

397
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,100
and it has

398
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,380
the 40 gpi opens you'd expect as well as

399
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,900
That pci slot we mentioned and a real-time clock. Okay, that's actually also worth mentioning isn't it?

400
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,900
Because the pi doesn't have that does it right?

401
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,500
So that's also uh, kind of great and kind of nice and cheesy

402
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,620
You have been sort of trying to get me to try it out for a while

403
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,300
And I think the part that where you're trying to get me to try it out for a while

404
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:17,900
And I think the part that where you convinced me was when you showed me like some of the nas boxes people are building with

405
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:22,780
This thing pine themselves actually sell a nas case that you can buy but

406
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,520
There are all there are tons of 3d printed cases out there for the pine 64

407
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,540
And I think really what it comes down to is adding that pcie lane breaking that out

408
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,700
Really kind of expands what you can do with this board and you know

409
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,780
Just like you said this would be the perfect board even if you just slapped a couple of sata drives in

410
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:45,100
The nas case I think will support uh, two three point fives or two two point fives

411
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,900
perfect for your little home file storage or

412
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,380
Home assistant or any any sort of you know, shinobi or anything like that

413
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:57,980
This would be the perfect box for that. This probably would be a lot better box for my for my shinobi setup at the rv

414
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,980
So let's get into the setup here

415
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:04,460
I want to give you a price range and I I want to challenge you that if you're setting up a home server

416
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,620
That is based on an x86 box right now

417
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:12,540
And you don't have more than 12 people living in your home. You need to really seriously consider what i'm talking about

418
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:18,140
But don't do what I do, but you should think about it. So the rock pro 64 4 gigabyte

419
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,620
System is 80. I'm rounding up here in all these numbers. I'm rounding up

420
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:29,820
A power adapter which it will not come with will cost you 12. You need 12 volt 5 amp power adapter non-switching

421
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,380
I bought a 250 gigabyte

422
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:38,780
I bought a 250 gigabyte mvme western digital blue drive standby on why I went blue

423
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,340
$55

424
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,500
And then the mvme pci adapter

425
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,820
$11

426
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:52,700
So my total rounding up for all of this for a system that I think would compete with a nuke for most home server uses

427
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,940
150 us greenbacks 150 total all in for a system

428
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,480
that is

429
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:08,060
remarkably performant and the other nice thing about the rock pro 64 4 gigabyte board is it is designated by pine 64

430
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,420
As a long-term support board, so they're committing to supplying it for five years

431
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:19,500
So that's until 2023 at least which is maybe one of those factors that helps build the community of people using it

432
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:27,100
When you add in this 11 dollar pcie adapter and then you just snap in the blue and I went with I went with the one

433
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,380
I'll have linked in the show notes because it supports the western digital blue drives

434
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:34,900
And I think possibly according to their wiki the pine 64

435
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,300
Pci mvme adapter does not support western digital blue

436
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,460
The reason I opted to go for blue is they have a good life cycle

437
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:49,580
But also you're not gonna get the full beans with this disc on the pine 64

438
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,580
The reality is the PCI bus is limited to such that you're gonna get good performance

439
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:02,020
But you're not gonna get high-end MV me performance. So here's the numbers you're gonna see it essentially works out

440
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:05,780
What did we decide? What do we figure out was a 30 30 times speed difference about?

441
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,020
Yeah

442
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:10,820
when we switched from an SD card to this MV me drive that

443
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:15,620
Took an $11 adapter and then a $55 West digital blue off Amazon

444
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,440
We went from a 22 megabyte a second transfer rate

445
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,060
to around

446
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:26,900
110 615 megabytes a second on average and it peaks above that and

447
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:33,820
When you open up the disk, I owe like that all of a sudden you truly appreciate

448
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:42,140
What the rock pro 64s CPU is actually capable of it is truly IO bound by that SD card or eMMC

449
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:47,420
I would assume and you just open up the floodgates. It's remarkable what you can achieve

450
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,660
And so we thought we'd have a little bit of fun with it here on the podcast, right?

451
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,660
I mean you said you wanted us to use it as a server

452
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,500
So we thought why not set something up on telnet that we could give out to folks that they could they could connect to

453
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:05,820
So are you ready for me to give out the URL? Yeah. All right, so I would encourage you if you're listening live right now

454
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:14,740
Let's see how many connections this pine 64 rock pro 64 running off an MV me can take what we have here in

455
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,940
a container

456
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:22,580
Because what else would it be is I believe it's the Star Wars new hope in ASCII

457
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,340
That's right the famous one, you know, you can see we've got a self-hosted version

458
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:32,440
So, let's see how many ASCII streams of Star Wars the new hope we can get going right now chat room

459
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:38,220
Telnet to telnet Linux unplugged calm everyone telnet

460
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,940
Linux unplugged calm launch it up right now

461
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:48,780
Additionally for yeah, people are joining are they all right, I'm gonna open up two over here. Oh, yeah. Okay. I got mine going, too

462
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,220
Now if we can't bring this thing to its knees

463
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,820
We have prepared a punishment script

464
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:04,140
Oh God that will spawn hundreds of telnet sessions and start this thing now in our original tests off air

465
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,980
We were only able to test against the SD card, which was intrinsically bound by disk.io

466
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,380
I mean every time you'd launch a new client you'd be like, all right

467
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,860
Well, I'll wait for it to read the text off the disk. All right, give it a go

468
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:21,580
I am currently getting the Star Wars scroll right now same. Yeah, I got to say no

469
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,700
We've got I mean looks like like 20 plus already. All right, and

470
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,100
Let's how's it doing in that? Let's bring up the net data. Wes

471
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,980
Let's bring up the net data. So Wes and I are both monitoring on net data right now

472
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:38,620
Now you got to imagine this thing is rendering this ASCII out and then spitting it out over telnet to how many over 20 plus

473
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:45,420
Sessions, right? It's not it's gotta be 30 now. It's not a super complicated task, but it's a significant task and right now

474
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,100
it's sitting at a

475
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:53,740
Range of 8 to 14 percent CPU usage Wow, and every time it's doing this

476
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,940
It's spinning up a whole bunch of Python in the back end

477
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:03,180
Reading these files. It's it's actually a kind of an IO heavy workload surprisingly on the back end

478
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:07,320
But we're not even we're not even really cracking 14 percent 11

479
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,320
11 percent CPU usage right now

480
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:17,480
22 percent RAM usage a consistent near 3 megabits of telnet data is coming out of this thing right now

481
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,380
Pure text pure 3 megabits of text

482
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:29,160
Do you want to launch the punishing scripts? Oh, oh do I let's do it now this script will launch

483
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:35,180
hundreds of telnet sessions at the pine 64 rock pro 64

484
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,500
We just peaked up to 24 percent there for a second

485
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:44,060
I'm curious. Do you have a rough guess on how many connections we have there because we just hit 30 percent there for a second

486
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,060
Yeah, looks like well, let's let's pop over here

487
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,780
I mean, it's it's gotta be 40 50 my movies still streaming. Yeah, man

488
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:55,380
Hey, what do you expect that we get thrown out of there? So the telnet session is closing or what?

489
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,380
I don't know if it's gonna freeze up or

490
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,500
If our internet connection goes first, I'm curious to see which one it is

491
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:08,220
We're up to 32.2 percent 32.6 percent. Actually, it's climbing pretty pretty fast

492
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:12,140
We're now at 33 percent RAM usage seems a little slower

493
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:18,460
35 we almost just cracked 40 percent load 200 additional telnet clients

494
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,060
Just hit 44 percent. Oh, yeah, okay

495
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:30,780
So now we have like like what nearly 300 telnet sessions coming off this thing. I think it's getting slower now

496
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,980
I'll tell you my laptop is handling it poorly. Look at this

497
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,220
You can really start to see the load average increase on the box. Now. It's starting to get cooked. Oh

498
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,460
We just hit 45 percent. I think the internet connection is gonna go

499
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:47,780
Do you have passive cooling on that one or do you have some kind of ventilation just passive?

500
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:53,980
It's gone up not too much. It started around like 46 or so and now it's up to 52

501
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:59,060
It's just out in the open. Like I said, don't build it like this. I think if I was gonna build this for real I

502
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:04,780
Would probably probably try to get some sort of cooling solution on it, but I'd want it to still be quiet

503
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:08,020
So it'd have to be somewhat passive, but there's no heat sink or anything on it right now

504
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:11,740
I didn't get anything like that on the box. So we're just using it out of the box. Whoa

505
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:16,940
Oh, oh, we just hit 54 percent there on the old usage. Look at the net data charts

506
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,940
It's really starting to get up there now. I

507
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:24,400
Wonder if I could see how many network connections we have will it tell me? Oh my gosh

508
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Oh

509
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,520
Holy crap

510
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:35,440
We have over four hundred and four hundred nineteen active sessions right now on this box

511
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,680
Look at that line just rocking up there and this thing's still going. I

512
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,500
Don't know if we can kill it. I don't know if we can do it

513
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,480
Do you know in that laptop handle? Can you launch another 200? I can try

514
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,440
Doesn't seem very convincing there. We're running into the limits of what West's think-pack can handle. What do you think Wes?

515
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,920
All right, launching if anybody listening live has a way to spawn multiple telnet sessions

516
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,000
Go ahead and do it. Just give us the number in the chat room so we can do it. I've got like 60 of them. Go. Yeah

517
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,120
Yeah, one easy way to view if you launch a whole new terminal telnet can be a little fussy to run in the background

518
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,480
But if you just launch a whole new terminal and find whatever your terminal is for console stash

519
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,520
II and you can pass in the telnet command. So now we're at 47% 45%

520
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:26,920
We're almost halfway pegged. It's really impressive. We're at 61% ram usage now

521
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,480
We did hit a hundred and thirty megabytes a second on the disk IO for a brief moment

522
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:37,320
But it's settling down now because I think the batch of sessions is has settled. Isn't that impressive though? I think I think

523
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,640
Point may I mean you have nearly I wonder if we could see again

524
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,640
I mean the number of connections is just staggering at this point five hundred active connections

525
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,760
Could you imagine doing this back in the day? Oh, we're up to like five megs

526
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,760
Your text goodness five megs of pure text. How about that? Isn't that something?

527
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,160
Well the pine 64 rock pro 64 gets

528
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,360
My such a solid nod of approval after this modification

529
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,280
that

530
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,120
This is what I'm buying from now on. So the other nice part is I just SSH back into the box and you can't tell anything

531
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,480
Right, so it's not like it's a horrible experience for the admin while this is going on

532
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,640
Wow, wow, wow, wow, you guys can keep throwing at it if you want

533
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,480
but

534
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,560
This is this is a game changer as far as I'm concerned

535
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,200
I mean, it's just for the power and the price and all of that. It's just it's remarkable

536
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:39,200
So Wes, we did a real quick brief modification to start loading the system off of the MVME

537
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,920
Versus the SD card. So job one was to attach the MVME format it

538
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:52,200
Label it and then our sink over the SD card to that excluding like, you know proc and things like that

539
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,040
But then there was another tweak that we had to make to get it to actually load from the MVME

540
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,680
Yeah, and maybe here's a good time to mention that we're running in Mutt & Jones

541
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,940
Yeah, and maybe here's a good time to mention that we're running in Manjaro arm on this thing. Yes

542
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,160
Thank you. It started out with army and and that was working. All right, but

543
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,720
Manjaro has been such a dream

544
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,320
Partially because it already had kernel 5 6 ready to go working perfectly and that also man

545
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,320
It was really easy right now. We're funneling this through a droplet back here so that you don't get the studio

546
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,120
I yeah, it's just over wire card

547
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,320
that's a nice little advantage to using Manjaro on the pine 64 is

548
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,000
That the latest kernel means wire guards ready to go

549
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,500
And so you guys have all been doing this through you're going through a wire guard connection. You didn't even know it

550
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,880
So on top of that it's handling the crypto for wire guard like a freaking champ

551
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,960
I might add so we that's really impressive and it's meant that you know

552
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,960
All the various tools we needed getting you know Docker up and running

553
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:52,760
Getting the benchmark tools we were using going all that was easy because it was just right there in the repo. Yeah, and

554
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,600
with them focusing on the

555
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,080
pine book

556
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:03,200
Which is essentially the same internals as far as I understand it. It means that this thing's pretty much ready to go

557
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,380
So we grabbed I think it was actually labeled the pine book image for those

558
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,560
Which has worked just fine to get it actually running on the nvme was surprisingly easy

559
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:16,560
It looks like they're using the ext Linux bootloader at least as part of the boot chain

560
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:22,460
So really all we had to go do was modify ext linux.com and change, you know at the start

561
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,560
It's just it's just a label brute. So it finds that on the SD card

562
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:30,080
We just repointed that at the nvme drive and no problems that I mean we were a little skeptical

563
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,560
We hadn't tried this before and we're both not that familiar with some of the booting on these ARM systems

564
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,000
I figured it wouldn't work

565
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,680
We'd have to pull the SD card off and you know change things around a couple times worked first time flawlessly. Yeah, and

566
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,400
We knew instantly because it booted in a blink

567
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:50,200
We put it so fast. We're like, oh well that that had to be it

568
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:55,120
And of course we logged in and immediately confirmed it and I just I got underscore all of this for

569
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:00,260
150 US greenbacks off Amazon or wherever you get your pine pine rock pro 64

570
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,920
So man Jarrah was pretty great having wire guard in there is really nice

571
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,680
There's also a bunch of other OS as though cheese you told me about arm being recently

572
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,520
Yeah, so there's arm being it's out there that

573
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,800
You know is developed for a lot of these other boards, but there are a ton of other builds available for this rock pro 64

574
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,440
I mean if you want to get your slack wear on your

575
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,400
Open media vault might be a great solution if you're gonna use this as a NAS

576
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,560
centos

577
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,200
Manjaro obviously

578
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,200
Straight-up Debian if you want

579
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,560
You know, I would like to see maybe

580
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,800
Punishing it with other things as well

581
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,600
Like I don't know throwing a mumble server on there seeing how many we could get on there or something like that

582
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,040
You're getting you know

583
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,280
610 megabits a second

584
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,640
Read write on the disk compared to the 22 that you were getting off the SD card

585
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,680
You'd probably get anywhere from 100 to 150

586
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,440
Off an eMMC module, but at that 610 that you're getting off the NVMe

587
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:03,760
You could go with an SSD might be a little bit less expensive if you wanted to double up drives

588
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,500
Might cost you a little bit more money, but you're gonna run around the 500 megabits a second

589
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:14,400
Speed on that so you are gaining a little a little bit by using the NVMe and I'm sure

590
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:22,200
Like you said whenever you initially logged in you immediately were able to tell the difference the pine folks. They sell a rock pro like compatible

591
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:27,780
SAT adapter that has two ports on it. So you could easily probably do that. That's a great. That's a great idea

592
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,460
I wasn't really clear on what kind of performance I was good

593
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:36,980
I didn't I was just gonna be happy with several hundred megabytes, but I'm pretty thrilled because it's peaked above 600, too

594
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,700
Which is nice. I'll tell you what. I'm building everything with this for my home server stuff. I'm gonna keep my pies

595
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:46,240
I think they're great. But in the future, I'm just gonna use these they're just that much faster

596
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,240
the PCI slot means that I could use them for different tasks Wes and I are already kind of

597
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,660
Thinking about how great you could

598
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:58,240
Really build a router out of this thing if you just put a nice gigabit Nick in that PCI slot

599
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,980
Yeah, I think over the weekend. I saw Ryan Huber

600
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:05,100
One of the nebula depths we've had on the show and he's got himself a little PI router

601
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:10,280
This seems like it'd be a great upgrade for that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, especially because it'd be out right there on the PCI bus

602
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:15,060
It's sort of it sort of sets my benchmark now for any kind of small board computer

603
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:21,420
It needs to have PCI Express like this is the game changer for me when it comes to these devices

604
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,540
And manager has been super solid on there. I look forward to also trying to boot too

605
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:29,180
I don't know if but is there an Ubuntu image for I don't think oh no I did

606
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,420
I said I know for one at least I haven't seen a 2004 one

607
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:38,380
One of the things the pine 64 folks have is I think it's a fork of etcher

608
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:45,280
That just downloads images that are compatible with the pine 64 that you so you select which one you have

609
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,660
Which model of device you have and it downloads the image and then writes it for you to an SD card

610
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,820
Which makes it really simple. I mean, it's pretty big difference

611
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:59,540
I mean an average of 610 megabytes a second versus 22 and then you're really fueling that processor

612
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,540
you combine that with the gigabit Nick and

613
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:06,740
It's remarkable what Linux can do on a computer that costs

614
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:13,380
$80 to make this all happen. We discovered a handy little open-source Python program called ASCII tell that server

615
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,220
Yeah, it does exactly what it sounds like so we didn't have to go

616
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:22,100
You know hammer some other person's server and it's a pretty simple little Python script ready to go in a Docker container

617
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,740
And if you want to try yourself

618
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,660
Just hit the show notes

619
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:30,860
Why wouldn't you so everybody kind of calmed down on the old server punishment and then Alex got in on the fun

620
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:35,020
And he spawned a thousand sessions and for a second there

621
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:41,500
We just hit 60% load when he after he spawned a thousand telnet sessions to this thing 10,000 sessions

622
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,620
Well, I'm sorry what?

623
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:50,540
10,000 sessions at least that's what his numbers say. Are you serious? Mm-hmm. Oh my gosh. That's a lot

624
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:55,380
It really is impressive. It's it is using 74% of the RAM now

625
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,300
And it is definitely loading up the CPU

626
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,300
Oh

627
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:05,020
Man, that is really nuts. Look at that thing go. It's hitting that disk, too

628
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:09,140
That's fascinating every time a new batch starts the disk IO really kicks up

629
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:14,260
Yeah, there are some optimizations that could be had in this Python program. Yeah, but it seems like it's really delivering

630
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:18,260
so that's pretty neat that was fun. Thank you everybody for participating and

631
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:23,180
Don't do what we do. But if you do, I think you're gonna be impressed with the results

632
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:28,760
All right. How about some app picks before we get out of here? This is one

633
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,860
we've been kicking around for a couple of weeks, but we finally had a chance to

634
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,940
Sneak it in its beats and not the headphones

635
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:42,740
So yeah this week beats with its cute little beat icon is a media library management system for

636
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,340
Obsessive music geeks is how they label themselves

637
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:52,060
Basically allowing you to pull all the metadata from your collection of music or media files

638
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:57,580
Allow you to easily tag those with music brains discogs a beat port

639
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:05,520
Transcode your audio into any format that you'd like and even launch a web server from within beats to allow you to

640
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:12,140
You know query your your music collection that way you can listen to your tracks there provided

641
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,460
You know, you have an HTML 5 browser, which you wouldn't

642
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:21,060
you know, it's a great little tool command line basically and

643
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,740
get in there and tag all your music and and

644
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:30,100
Get it all sorted up the way you like to have your music tagged and sorted and I think it's a cool little app

645
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,420
I think it's perfect for people who are obsessive about

646
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,900
Tagging their music and wanting their tags to be correct

647
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:42,580
Or at least consistent so get out there and give it a shot. Very nice. That is something I will check out

648
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:48,120
It's beats be ETS and we'll have a link in the notes if you want to check that out

649
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,880
It is nice to have that stuff figured out. I know I've got some old music collection

650
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:58,680
Then I just kind of stay away from it because I know it's a mess. Yeah, it's MIT licensed to so have added Haas

651
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:03,840
It's all yours. That's pretty nice. Well, there you go. That's our episode for today

652
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,300
Be sure to check out the Ubuntu podcast where you can get more poppy

653
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,320
be sure to check out tech snap where you can get Westpain along with Jim Salter and

654
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:16,160
check out my personal site Chris last calm where I have new projects and

655
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:22,120
What nots over there as well as self-hosted where a lot of the stuff about things you run yourself on your own infrastructure

656
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:28,460
Or where you make compromises and host in the cloud are discussed on the self-hosted podcast at self hosted dot show

657
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:34,600
Any other business with maybe you have some homework to finish watching Star Wars after the show. I

658
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:43,400
Like this whole outfit this quarantine outfits good. I I didn't know they sold the quarantine outfits sort of styled as a pimp suit

659
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,580
It looks good on you. I mean, it's getting a little warm, but thankfully it's sealed up. So you can't smell anything

660
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,120
Yeah, no, it's kind of nice. It's kind of nice

661
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,520
Although that hole in the face mask so you can use the microphone seems like it invalidates the entire point

662
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,920
I have to look up the science. Yeah, I noticed you coughing into the mic, too

663
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:06,600
I don't like that check out Linux unplug calm slash three four nine four notes for everything. We talked about please join us live next Tuesday

664
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,640
We love having you here. It makes it that much better at JB live TV noon Pacific

665
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,980
And of course, we're in that mumble room this Sunday at noon. See you next Tuesday

666
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:48,360
Well, we've now hit 82% 86% on the rock pro 64 at 98% memory usage

667
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:54,200
Wow, I can't believe we haven't run out of sockets yet. This is unbelievable really Oh up to 61 degrees Celsius

668
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:59,920
And how is net data even still responding? I don't even know that data. You're the best. How is this happening right now?

669
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,920
Yeah, what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?

670
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:10,920
To accomplish 81% CPU uses. Oh, we're starting to get drops in the data. I just got my first drop in the data

671
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,920
So we're really getting there now

672
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,640
98.1% memory usage by the way, we are doing a consistent

673
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,520
253 megabits of disk reading

674
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:24,520
Can I just read these stats for a second 82% CPU usage?

675
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,760
253 megabits consistently from the disk and 98.1%

676
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:34,840
RAM and I think it may have just finally locked up. Are you still on the console over there? Are you still ssh-ed in?

677
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,080
Yeah, it's still responding. It looks like net data has died

678
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:47,360
Yeah, I got dropped too. This is so bad. I was just in the middle of the movie

679
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:53,640
Yeah, I got dropped too. This is so bad. I was just in the middle of the movie
