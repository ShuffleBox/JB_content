1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
I think Star Trek has some of the best sound effects in the sci-fi biz, one of the things

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,980
that's kept them around.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:12,820
And so I was pretty excited when I saw on the subreddit that KabiLinux, K-A-B-I Linux,

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,640
he wrote this post saying, hoping some here will like this, but if you have the package

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,000
SOX installed, that's S-O-X, you can run the code below in the terminal and it will pump

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,800
out what sounds like the hum of the Enterprise without the wobble, unfortunately.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,680
But you also don't need the warp core.

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,800
So first you have to have the SOX package installed on your machine, and then you run

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:40,440
this play command here, and once you hit play, it creates the engine sound effect of the

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,160
Enterprise D, which is a pretty cool white noise effect.

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,560
And then if you're like a professional internet broadcaster, you'll have other sounds ready

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:56,160
to go, like Star Trek bridge sounds, and then it really sounds like you're in Star Trek

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,880
now, which is pretty cool, just using SOX.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,440
I got a kick out of that.

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,000
So you don't have to have, although, I mean, I added the sound effects from the bridge,

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
but there you go.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,680
So maybe instead of doing Linux unplugged this time, today we'll do Star Trek unplugged.

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
You think that'd be a hit?

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:22,320
I think we tried that once, I don't think it worked very well.

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,480
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that spent more time on a spreadsheet

21
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,520
this week than the last 10 years.

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,920
My name is Chris, and we have a heck of an episode for you.

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,520
This is episode 94 of the Linux Unplugged show, and joining us in just a little bit

24
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,800
will be Michael Arabell from Ferronix to discuss a new initiative he's working on, Linux benchmarking

25
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
automated style.

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,280
You know, wouldn't it be interesting to track the progress of some of the most important

27
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,760
projects like, oh, I don't know, the Linux kernel, GCC, LLVM?

28
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,560
When they release new builds, how does that impact their performance?

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,160
Well, over at linuxbenchmarking.com, Michael has set out just to find that out, automated

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,760
builds after new releases with charts.

31
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,600
Go in there and say, how's the Linux kernel been trending the last six months?

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,160
And this site might just show you.

33
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,080
What's this initiative all about, and what is his goal?

34
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,080
We'll talk to him today.

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,840
Also, we'll give him a little congrats on the 11th year of Ferronix.com, so that'll

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
be coming up.

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,120
And then later in the show, we're gonna talk about Fedora 22, a new release that just hit

38
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
the web today.

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
I installed it.

40
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,840
We've got some initial reactions.

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,200
We're gonna give you a full review on Sunday's Linux action show, but today, I ran into a

42
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,080
snag or two that you might run into if you have a certain make Nvidia card that'll prevent

43
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,080
GDM from starting.

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,720
I'll tell you how to fix that in today's episode and give you my first reactions, get some

45
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,800
mumble room takes.

46
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:43,120
But before we get to any of that, we do have some serious business to get to, some unfortunate

47
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,860
sad news.

48
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,400
Every now and then, a great distribution comes and goes.

49
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,120
The company and people behind them come and go.

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,320
And this week, it appears to be official, Mandriva, the company behind the Linux distribution

51
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:03,400
so many of us, so, so many of us started out with, is officially going away.

52
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,720
Yes, apparently, according to a post over in Germany, or maybe it was France, there's

53
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,720
a translation.

54
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,440
Thankfully, Ferronix has one for us.

55
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,080
Even though the company made $553,000 last year, not enough for 10 to 19 employees, Mandriva

56
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,080
as a company is now being liquidated.

57
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,680
And to help reflect on this once great distribution, I'll bring in our mumble room.

58
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,640
Time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

59
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
Hello.

60
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Hello.

61
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,160
So any Mandriva users, say I. Any Mandriva users in here or Mandrake users back in the

62
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
day?

63
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
I.

64
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
I.

65
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
I.

66
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
Me.

67
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

68
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
It's kind of sad.

69
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
That's what got me started.

70
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
Yeah, it really was.

71
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,480
I mean, I probably started with dubbing a Red Hat technically, but when it came time

72
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,720
for Linux for me that I wanted to cut my teeth on and use for on my systems, I used Mandrake.

73
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,440
And I even became a Mandrake club member.

74
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,040
I was in the Mandrake club, so I got the special URPMI repos.

75
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,720
I felt pretty cool.

76
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,920
And I don't know what this means for the offshoots, like Mandriva and others.

77
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
Magia.

78
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,920
Moondrake?

79
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Was that the other one, Rotten Corpse?

80
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Yeah, there's Moondrake.

81
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,960
Well, I think that was a spinoff of the original Mandrake.

82
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Yeah, okay.

83
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Yeah, yeah.

84
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,200
I don't know what it means for those guys, and Open Mandriva, of course, like that.

85
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,640
That doesn't seem to have been like a lot of interest taking up in those, though.

86
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
Mandrake 8.

87
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
Yep, Mandrake 8.

88
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Whiskey.

89
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
I had that in the box.

90
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
That was great.

91
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,640
Mandrake 8 in the box was great.

92
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,160
You know, one of the great things about Mandrake back in the day was that it had the Drac config.

93
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,320
Let's see if I can find a picture of this Mandrake Drac config.

94
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,120
You guys know what I'm talking about?

95
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,640
I mean, Open, or Drac Conf.

96
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,640
That's what it was.

97
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
Drac Conf.

98
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,700
OpenSUSE, of course, had Yast, which was, you know, pretty great.

99
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,280
But I felt like, in some ways, Linux Mandrake's Drac Conf had the leg up when it came to like

100
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,120
the Samba automation and user creation and just managing services.

101
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,040
It just felt like a quicker, faster tool.

102
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,460
Boy, looking back at it now, it really looks antiquated.

103
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,960
But this was sort of like, this was sort of your only front-end option, really, when configuring

104
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,600
X really meant getting into your Xorg comp file.

105
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:21,160
And if you just, you know, didn't want to hassle with that stuff, this was so perfect.

106
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,200
And it did get more refined over the years.

107
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
And it got forked.

108
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,800
It's still out there in different iterations.

109
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:34,400
But there was a time where I was able to, you know, fully set up Active Directory authentication,

110
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,200
automated NTP setup.

111
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:42,040
All these things that you just had to do by hand back then in Linux, Wi-Fi, like when

112
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:48,160
Wi-Fi was brand new, like Mandrake made it easiest to get it working back then.

113
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,220
It was a really great distro.

114
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,040
And the other thing they did, and they gave you really, you know, straightforward front-end

115
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,240
options for starting and stopping services.

116
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,040
The other thing they did early on is they provided a really solid solution to how crappy

117
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,920
RPMs were.

118
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:12,200
You know, they had URPMI, which really was, in some ways, maybe better than YUM, maybe

119
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,640
not, I don't know anymore, DNF, like who could say.

120
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,200
But it was definitely way better than any other RPM-based distro out there.

121
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:26,600
This was really, in my opinion, the usable RPM-based distro at the time because of URPMI.

122
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,600
And then they had like, you know, one of the first software source managers where you could

123
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,920
manage between online sources, update sources, and CDs.

124
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,720
And again, SUSE got all that and yassed pretty quickly.

125
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,480
But that's what made Mandrake work so well, I think, for people.

126
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,440
And man, they had the best installer.

127
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,960
Mandrake had a really unique installer where the progress was all down on the left-hand

128
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
side of the installer.

129
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
Yeah, here it is.

130
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
Here it is.

131
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah, I don't know if you guys remember this.

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,640
They also had the best partitioner back in the day, too.

133
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,920
They really had a great partitioner.

134
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,040
And so you always knew right where you're at in the installation process, and you could

135
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
jump back and forth.

136
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,600
And they kept that look for years.

137
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,760
They refined it over time and made it look a little better.

138
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,840
But they kept that basic functionality.

139
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,280
So I'm showing you right here, I'm showing you like, this is like a super old version

140
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,280
of Mandrake.

141
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,200
And then here's Mandrake 9.1.

142
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,440
And then here is Mandrake 2005.

143
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,160
And they kept that, and here's 9.1 again, they kept that list along the side.

144
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,720
It was so cool.

145
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,520
I think they had, and they had a great text installer, too, if you had to go that route.

146
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
Oh, man.

147
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
Oh, wow.

148
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,880
Oh, this screenshot, Mandrake Linux 8, here it is.

149
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,960
This was my bag back in the day.

150
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,200
Oh, wow.

151
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,360
This is so old looking now.

152
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,360
I can't really get any better on it.

153
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,560
And they were one of the first to make it easy to use riserfs, too.

154
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,640
Like they made it super easy to use journaled file systems when journaled file systems were

155
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,080
brand new to Linux.

156
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,200
And they had security things you could do in the installation that would sort of tell

157
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,800
you how secure it was going to be and give you sort of like a report.

158
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,440
You could make a boot disk during the installation.

159
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,200
So in case you ever screwed up your bootloader installation during the installer process,

160
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,880
it'll ask you if you wanted to make, of course, it'd be up to a floppy disk, because back

161
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,600
then everybody had floppy disks.

162
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,160
But it would make you an emergency bootloader floppy disk that you could always get back

163
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,680
into your Linux installation with if you somehow hosed your bootloader.

164
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,720
How come we don't do that now?

165
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,360
Why did we stop doing that?

166
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,040
And then of course, because X was a total monster back then, the last thing you did

167
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,360
in the installation, because it was actually, technically it was fine if at this point the

168
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,080
installation totally locked up, because everything was pretty much done.

169
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,720
I don't know if it was unmounted the file systems, but beyond that, pretty much everything

170
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
was done.

171
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,560
So the last thing it would do is launch their super cool X configuration thing where you'd

172
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,720
go into this X configurator and it had arrows along the edges of the screen so you could

173
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,520
see if you had overscan on your CRT monitor, and you could tweak it back in and position

174
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,880
it just right, and then save that, and it would write your Xorg config for you.

175
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,800
It wasn't even Xorg back then, it was just X11.

176
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,120
It would write your X11 config, and they'd put it intentionally, if you're watching the

177
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,720
video version, you can see it's the last step right there.

178
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,520
They did it intentionally because that was always the thing that crashed.

179
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,000
Because you had to tell it what your video card was.

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,080
You had to tell it everything about your, you had to tell it what your monitor's capable

181
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
of doing.

182
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,960
It couldn't detect any of that.

183
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,920
And a lot of times the CRT monitors were very particular, oh and so were the early LCD monitors,

184
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:39,360
and they had, again, one of the best setups to do that, that final X11 step.

185
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,160
It almost makes me want to go find an ISO and do it one more time, except for old Linux

186
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,960
is actually never quite as great as you remember.

187
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,800
In Mumble Room, you guys have any passing Mandriva or Mandrake thoughts you want to

188
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,440
share before we move on?

189
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,200
I think it was time.

190
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,680
They didn't have anything in their final few years that made them stand out, and the community

191
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,720
fell away, went to their fault products.

192
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,240
They didn't need to keep going on because they had nothing left.

193
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,040
And they were of a product of a different time, where you had these problems, like you

194
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:33,240
had to have the Xconfig, you had to have XF86config was the command, thank you Minimic.

195
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,680
You had to have things like that.

196
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,640
You also, at the end of the installation, towards the end of the installation, had to

197
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,760
figure out how was the user going to get online?

198
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,920
Because it was an assume they didn't even have an ethernet port.

199
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,400
They might have had USB, but they probably had an ISP that required something like PPOE

200
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,920
or PPTP, and so they had to build these things in.

201
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
They had to accommodate for these.

202
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,680
And then later on, when the new generation distributions came around, they didn't have

203
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,800
to really account for kinds of these things.

204
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,040
Now, Kernelix, I wanted to give you a chance.

205
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,560
Were you a Mandrake user back in the day?

206
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,800
So Mandrake Linux was actually the first Linux I ever used.

207
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,240
I'd been asking around if anyone knew of this Linux or where I could obtain it, and finally

208
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,520
I found a guy that said, oh, here, I got a copy for you.

209
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,640
So he gave it to me on a CD, and I remember sticking it in my computer, and I was all

210
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,560
excited because I was going to try this Linux thing that was going to be more stable and

211
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,600
more secure and was going to do everything for me.

212
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,560
I stick the CD in there and I boot off of it, and I remember an X showed up.

213
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,360
The cursor was an X back then, and I was so excited because I was like, I remember thinking

214
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,520
to myself, wow, what an awesome cursor replacement, an X rather than an arrow.

215
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
That makes so much sense.

216
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,760
I got it and it really didn't make any sense.

217
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,000
I was just happy that it was not Microsoft, and I booted into Linux, and I was so excited.

218
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,880
I was like, oh, look, it comes with games, and it comes with a word processor, and wait,

219
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,400
network doesn't work, and sound doesn't work, and my display is limited to 800 by 600, and

220
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,760
here's a couple other things that don't work.

221
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,280
So all right, no problem.

222
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,520
Played with it for a couple days and decided I'm going to go back to Windows.

223
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,380
I stick my, at the time I think it was Windows ME or Windows 2000, I stick the disk back

224
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,920
in there, and it didn't recognize the partition that Mandrake had used, and so it just didn't

225
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,040
see my hard drive, and I just didn't have a computer with internet for like three months.

226
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,680
And after that experience, and when I finally did get it fixed, I swore I would never touch

227
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,800
Linux again because it was such a horrible experience.

228
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,200
Well, good thing that didn't stick.

229
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,160
Yeah, well, there you go.

230
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,520
I remember I also, I was such a Mandrake fan, I tried out their Mandrake Enterprise servers

231
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
they rolled out.

232
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,760
The first squid proxy server I ever deployed ran on Mandrake using Mandrake in a server

233
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
edition.

234
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,600
Like I said, I became a Mandrake club member, whatever they called it back then.

235
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
I was all in.

236
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,920
I was all, I bought every box set that they sold.

237
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,560
It was pretty cool.

238
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:53,380
So hopes and our best to the Mandrake folks and the Mandrave company, and to the offshoots

239
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,400
that continue on in sort of their legacy.

240
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,840
So that is being very nostalgic.

241
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,420
Now let's go to the total opposite end of the spectrum, and this is so cool, and it

242
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,760
really does make it feel like 2015.

243
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,360
Then you're going to be able to share your smartphone GPS location information with the

244
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,160
location services built into the GNOME desktop to make that more accurate.

245
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,800
And you might be wondering why, but it actually is sort of useful.

246
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,040
The GNOME desktop derives a lot of information when you allow it based on your IP location

247
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,160
primarily, unless you actually have a computer with a GPS chip in it that talks to the Linux

248
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,440
system.

249
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,560
And what it does, the things I'm aware of, and I'm sure there's many more, is it sets

250
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,200
things like automatically your time zone, best NTP server, calendar settings, a lot

251
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,800
of little things like this.

252
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,040
And the more accurate you get that, the better GNOME is, especially if you're in a laptop

253
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
and you're traveling.

254
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,040
Like, say, take Noah, for example.

255
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,160
When he's in Grand Forks right now, and then he comes over here to the JB1 studio, if GNOME

256
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,040
is aware of his location, it'll automatically adjust his clock and his calendar appointment

257
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,680
reminders for him to be in this time zone.

258
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,280
And so as part of the Google Summer of Code project, there is a developer who is aiming

259
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:03,680
to set up an app that'll share location information when you have this other companion app on

260
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,880
the Android device called GeoClue.

261
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
And this is pretty cool.

262
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,200
A GPS position is something that most of us are obviously pretty familiar with, but you

263
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,480
might not always understand why.

264
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,280
So this would kind of be a way you could play with it on your Linux desktop without having

265
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,920
to have a GPS chip in your computer to see if there's any value in it.

266
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,400
I think that's kind of neat.

267
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,840
And they're adding more and more things in GNOME, like maps and things like that, that

268
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
could use this.

269
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,720
Plus, you got to assume other projects could take advantage of this.

270
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,640
So each time the Android location listener application in the background gets a new location,

271
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,420
which Android is doing this all the time for Google Now or for your weather checking application

272
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,760
or, you know, the way it works on Android is for the most part, not always, but for

273
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,560
the most part, if an application needs location, it just asks the location service instead

274
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,920
of having to hit the GPS itself.

275
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,720
Because if another application just checked 55 milliseconds ago, five minutes ago, why

276
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,700
hit the GPS antenna again when you can just check that database?

277
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,800
So that's essentially what the service does.

278
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,320
So anytime that database is updated, this app also gets notified, this GeoClue.

279
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,960
Using MDNS on your Wi-Fi network, it'll auto discover the companion app running on your

280
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,160
GNOME desktop, and anytime that location database gets updated on Android, a copy of that notification

281
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,760
will be sent over the network, over Wi-Fi, to the companion app on your GNOME desktop.

282
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,300
So any app that checks the location on your Android device will then also update the location

283
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,300
information for GNOME.

284
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,280
So you kind of get the benefit of getting constant location information without having

285
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,840
to hit your battery really hard because it's just hitting it when the other apps are already

286
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,640
hitting it.

287
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,400
And of course, you could just turn off the bridging app if you didn't want to use that

288
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
or not use it.

289
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,560
I think it's an interesting start, and it's an interesting use of Google Summer of Code,

290
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,040
and it could make the location-based stuff that we're seeing the GNOME project work on

291
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,480
more relevant without having to have expensive hardware in your laptop or desktop because

292
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,800
I'm never going to put a GPS.

293
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,480
I might maybe one day have like an LTE card in a laptop that has GPS built in.

294
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,560
That'd be pretty cool, but I'm never going to have that in my arch desktop upstairs in

295
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,840
my office.

296
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,180
So now I can take advantage of some of those same location things using that without a

297
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,180
big battery drain.

298
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,280
I think it's pretty cool.

299
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,240
And you can also power other machines.

300
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,080
It's not just a, this is the other thing I thought was interesting, is you could have

301
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,320
like five of your desktops to this one Android device.

302
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,800
So five of your GNOME desktops, for example, could all be getting location if they're all

303
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
like all in the same spot.

304
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,700
See, it's not a one-to-one ratio.

305
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,400
So one phone can update the location for multiple desktops as well, which is kind of a neat

306
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
feature, I think.

307
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,480
I'll tell you about another neat feature.

308
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,680
That'd be our next sponsor right here on the Linux Unplugged program, and that is our friends

309
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,080
over at Ting.

310
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:27,040
Go to linux.ting.com to get a limited time $50 discount off your first Ting device or

311
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,720
if you have a Ting-compatible device, they'll give you a $50 service credit.

312
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,640
Now, when I signed up, I got a $25 service credit, and that paid for more than my first

313
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,640
month.

314
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,680
So I can only imagine what $50 is going to do for you guys, or really, just go get a

315
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,680
brand new device.

316
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,520
Ting has a great range of devices, from starting literally like around $50 for a feature phone

317
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,960
all the way up to the best Android phones and iPhones out in the market today.

318
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,560
And they just recently added the OnePlus, which you can get right from Ting, which is

319
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,560
really great.

320
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,280
So go to linux.ting.com to take advantage of that $50 discount.

321
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,000
Now why Ting's service?

322
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,400
Why switch to Ting?

323
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,240
First of all, I think you're going to like the fact that you only pay for what you use.

324
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,520
Finally, right?

325
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,560
That's how it should always be.

326
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,120
And sometimes outside the US, that is how it is, but not here in the US.

327
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,540
We have a duopoly in place.

328
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,360
This duopoly controls the market with a strong arm that you wouldn't believe.

329
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,480
And so there's very little flexibility in here.

330
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,440
So Ting had to come up with a whole new way to do this.

331
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,600
So you only pay for what you use.

332
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,160
It's just flat $6 for the line.

333
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,960
And then your usage on top of that, you just take your minutes, your message, your megabytes,

334
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,000
whatever bucket you fall into, that's all you have to pay.

335
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,560
That's really super nice.

336
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,520
Because then if you want to have multiple devices for testing applications, or maybe

337
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,240
you have a small business, or maybe like in my case, I have a nanny that is, I can't really

338
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,000
afford to pay for her phone all the time.

339
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,400
But if I only pay for it when she needs it, because some sort of emergency, that is absolutely

340
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,600
worth it for me.

341
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,200
And that's why I love the Ting services based around me and my usage, not my individual

342
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,400
devices, which I think is a superior model to begin with, and they have no whole customer

343
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
service.

344
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:03,040
So if I give the phone to somebody and they have problems, they call Ting at 1-855-TING-FTW,

345
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,400
and a real human being will answer the phone, so I don't have to get stuck doing the troubleshooting.

346
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,920
I really like that.

347
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,940
I just don't want to get tied down helping people with all of the little technical issues.

348
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,800
So the fact that I can hand that off to Ting, they also have a really good help site.

349
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,080
So like in case of Rekai, he doesn't ever have to call in, he'll just go to the Ting

350
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,960
help service, and he can just take care of all his problems that way.

351
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,760
So there's a great range depending on your ability, so it makes it great for a small

352
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
business or a family.

353
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,920
I love that.

354
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,840
So go to linux.ting.com, start there to get our special discount.

355
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,320
That'll give you a $50 discount off all of their great devices, and then you can check

356
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,000
out the fact that they have an early termination relief program, so if you're stuck in a stupid

357
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,220
contract right now, they're going to help you get out of that with their ETF program.

358
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,360
Check that out.

359
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,520
And of course, your phone's going to be unlocked, so you're going to get long-term value out

360
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
of it.

361
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
So here's what you do.

362
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,700
You go to linux.ting.com, check them out.

363
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,700
Also check out their blog.

364
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,800
Like, they just recently posted this video, now this video isn't narrated, but I think

365
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,120
I'm going to do the narration for them right now.

366
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,120
They can just do this for free.

367
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,760
Ting, I'm doing this for you.

368
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,080
So this is a Ting tip, and I'm putting this out here because it's probably good for you

369
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,740
guys to automatically download podcasts over Wi-Fi.

370
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,060
If you're using Pocket Cast, you open up the Pocket Cast app, and then once it's in there,

371
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,080
open up the settings menu, where you go to that little hamburger menu, it slides out,

372
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,680
and then go down into the settings cog at the bottom of that, and then select episode

373
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,360
updates in the app, but it's the second option.

374
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,840
And then in there, there's the option check enabled under auto download, say enabled,

375
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,940
automatically download, and then make sure only on Wi-Fi, so that way, when new episodes

376
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,920
come out, it'll automatically download the new episode, but it won't do it when you're

377
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
on cellular.

378
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,760
It's kind of the best of both worlds, so when the new Linux unplugged, hey look, there's

379
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,180
Linux Action Show right there.

380
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,200
When the new Linux Action Show comes out in HD, you don't have to feel guilty about doing

381
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,800
the high download, but you also get it automatically.

382
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,880
That's how I do my Pocket Cast, is I have it set to auto download every show that comes

383
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,360
out, I keep the last two to three episodes, depending on the podcast, and I have it set

384
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,520
to only download when I'm on Wi-Fi.

385
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,160
And so when I'm on the road, I get an idea of what I have coming up, and I could opt

386
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,920
to download over cellular if it's really important to me, and I do sometimes do that, but really

387
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,520
what I do is as soon as I get on my Wi-Fi connection, Pocket Cast just starts pulling

388
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,120
all of them down for me, and the next time I'm on the road, they're ready to go, and

389
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,200
I did not use any wireless data, and so I'm not paying for any wireless data.

390
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,380
And that's just a great way you can, if you're just a little bit technical savvy, just have

391
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,240
a little savviness, you really don't have to have much, you can really leverage the

392
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,380
way the Ting model works and save a ton of money.

393
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,880
So go to linux.ting.com, use that savings calculator, see how much money you'd freaking

394
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
save.

395
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,280
I've saved over $2,000.

396
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,760
You can hit the savings calculator and find out how much you would save.

397
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,880
Linux.ting.com, and a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

398
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,040
Okay, I have to mention something.

399
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,240
Next week, the Linux Unplugged show is going to be live at 11 a.m. Pacific time, and I

400
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,360
know, you don't know what time that is in your time.

401
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,600
Go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

402
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
You hear that, Popey?

403
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
I'm talking to you!

404
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,320
You go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get it converted to your local time, but

405
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,520
yeah, I have some, or I lied, we're doing it at 10 a.m., see, it's a good thing I'm

406
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
checking the calendar.

407
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,800
This is why you gotta go to the calendar.

408
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,120
We're doing Linux Unplugged at 10 a.m., so right after Tech Talk next week, it's gonna

409
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,080
go Tech Talk, and then Linux Unplugged on Tuesday next week.

410
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,280
So just a little heads up, we're moving the recording schedule for Linux Unplugged, and

411
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,240
I'm making a big stink about it because the Mumble Room's super important to the show,

412
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,800
and I'd really like to have some people there.

413
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
I love you guys.

414
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,940
I love you so much.

415
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,940
So important to me.

416
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,520
So join me at 10 a.m. Pacific for Linux Unplugged next Tuesday.

417
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,640
Just moving it that week because I have some family that's coming to town that I have to

418
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,920
go pick up at the train station, and they're, see, this is what happens when family schedules

419
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
stuff.

420
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,760
They literally arrive at 2 p.m. when we would normally be going live.

421
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,240
Like, could they have picked a more perfect time?

422
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,320
I don't think so.

423
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,440
So we're doing 10 a.m. next Tuesday at jblive.tv.

424
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,680
Give us the Eastern time?

425
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,040
Dude, I gave you a website that automatically converts the time zones for you so I can accommodate

426
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
everybody.

427
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,440
How much more can I give?

428
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,320
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

429
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
Go take advantage of our robots.

430
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,160
After all, I pay them in Bitcoin.

431
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,520
You might as well use them for something.

432
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:11,440
Okay, well, I'm really excited to welcome back Michael Larabelle from phronix.com.

433
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,280
Michael actually joined us back in 2012, shortly after he'd gotten back from his visit with

434
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,260
Valve and we'd had all the big Steam news for Linux.

435
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,520
And this week, I invited Michael back on the show because he's launched an initiative that

436
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,880
I think is pretty interesting.

437
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,640
And I want to see if I'm grokking this right, Michael, so I'm going to run it past you.

438
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,360
Tell me if I've captured this right.

439
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,480
But it looks like you're kind of taking all of the work you've done with the Phronix Benchmarking

440
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,880
Suite, all of your experience you have with benchmarking for Phronix website and the Open

441
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,280
Benchmark project, and you are launching an automated testing site that essentially will

442
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,780
be monitoring some of the most popular open source projects and trending their performance

443
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,520
impact over time.

444
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,000
Am I kind of grokking this?

445
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Hi, Chris.

446
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,120
Yes, you're mostly correct.

447
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,680
It's basically to monitor the performance over time of important projects like the Linux

448
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,400
kernel, the GCC compiler, LLVM and Clang, and then I've also been working on some other

449
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:15,440
trackers for all the latest R-Clinix packages in real time and everything else like that.

450
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,280
And you're doing these testing and the results on a daily basis, correct?

451
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
Correct.

452
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,560
The majority of the trackers right now are running on a daily time basis, but there's

453
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,700
also the ability within the Phronix test suite to do per-commit testing, so basically whenever

454
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,000
there's a new get revision that the triggers would automatically fire off the new round

455
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
of testing.

456
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,160
But for my testing over the past several months, I've just found the daily testing to be best

457
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,480
off rather than having so many triggers per day of kernel benchmarking when each kernel

458
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,120
benchmark will end up taking several hours per system, etc.

459
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:55,360
So first of all, I got to say, if I'm following you correctly, this sounds like a massive

460
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,880
sacrifice of your man cave.

461
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,280
I just finished remodeling the basement and I basically devoted it entirely to this linuxbenchmarking.com

462
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,280
testing.

463
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,960
I'm seeing that.

464
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,520
It looks like it was at one point going to be a very nice theater with a bar and a projector

465
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,880
and a bench seat, and it looks like it's now dedicated to a server farm for doing benchmarks.

466
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,640
Beforehand, there are some pictures on one of the older Phronix articles that's linked

467
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,280
from linuxbenchmarking.com, but it was just like a complete wreck in the basement.

468
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,640
I actually just added the bar just because of whenever there's Phronix test suite customers

469
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,800
over here and then the projector is just nice for seeing the real time status of all the

470
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
systems running.

471
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Oh, I love it.

472
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,680
So the bar is for the benchmarking.

473
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,520
Oh, that is so cool.

474
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,520
That is way cooler.

475
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,400
I thought it was like some sort of sad sacrifice and instead it is actually way more badass

476
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,400
than that.

477
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,960
You have a bar in your benchmarking suite.

478
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,720
That is really cool.

479
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,800
So you say when customers come over, what kind of customers come over for the Phronix

480
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
benchmarking suite?

481
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
Is it like hardware manufacturers?

482
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,360
Can you give me a picture of what that's like because that's an area of your business that

483
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,480
I don't have any insights on at all.

484
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,760
Yeah, it's basically for any enterprise customers for the Phronix test suite that either want

485
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:16,640
customizations done for the PTS or openbenchmarking.org to better suit their roles and whatnot.

486
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,000
One customer that's able to be talked about publicly is actually GE that sponsored much

487
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,880
of this recent work which in turn led to the linuxbenchmarking.com is where they were rolling

488
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,800
out thousands of servers where they run benchmarks every day entirely powered by the Phronix

489
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,420
test suite and Floramatic.

490
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:36,440
So I'm sure for them and also really for the community in general, JB Hawke of Truth in

491
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,200
our chat room asked a great question and this is something that whenever you talk about

492
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,020
benchmarks, people always will try to poke holes in how the benchmark is constructed

493
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,720
or how it's ran.

494
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,320
So JB Hawke of Truth in our chat room says, could you give us an idea of who maintains

495
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,460
the test cases used to measure the target application?

496
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,000
Is that something you maintain?

497
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,500
Or is that like an open source project sort of like where different people are contributing

498
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,760
to that?

499
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,080
Do people add their own metrics from different projects?

500
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,200
How is that driven?

501
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,520
It's all powered by the Phronix test suite which in turn pulls it from our openbenchmarking.org

502
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,920
website that basically acts as a repository for all the test cases.

503
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,760
All those test cases are basically comprised of work that's done either by me or many other

504
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
contributors.

505
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,280
There's everything from like code weavers, they've submitted like wine test profiles

506
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,280
for measuring that.

507
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:30,240
And yeah, it's basically an open project and not anyone's able to recommend any new test

508
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,720
cases or adapt their test cases and upload them where the test profiles for the Phronix

509
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,840
test suite are just basically a few bash scripts and XML files.

510
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,840
Right.

511
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
I see.

512
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
Yeah.

513
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,400
And we've also uploaded like popular audio encoding tests to the open benchmarking site.

514
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,640
And so if I, for example, in Jupyter Broadcasting, if we developed a benchmark maybe for like

515
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,840
FFmpeg encoding setups, we could essentially upload like an FFmpeg benchmarking script

516
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,040
test suite and then if the community liked it and it got popular, then it would sort

517
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,040
of become a well-known.

518
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
Is that how it works?

519
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
Yes, indeed.

520
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
That's correct.

521
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,240
And though actually there is already FFmpeg benchmarking there, yeah, basically anyone

522
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:14,240
can submit new test profiles and from there it rolls out to anyone that's doing a public

523
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,760
or private deployment of the Phronix test suite, including linuxbenchmarking.com, which

524
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:27,160
is different than all the other tests, well, to back up a few steps, like Red Hat, Canonical

525
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:32,520
and others also maintain their own benchmarks against the latest Linux kernel and whatnot.

526
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,360
But yeah, their test cases are often limited without any intervention and they're also

527
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,480
often focused just around their use cases of like Apache web server performance or other

528
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:47,160
scientific areas rather than say running Linux gaming benchmark since the Linux gaming benchmarks

529
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,600
or Linux gaming customers aren't what leads to lots of their revenue.

530
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
Is that a fan behind you, I hear?

531
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,600
I guess actually just one of those servers that was just rebooting because it's now getting

532
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,200
ready for its new round of testing.

533
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,360
Yeah, that is exactly what I thought it was.

534
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,440
Man, those things are just banshees when you reboot them.

535
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:12,360
So when I look at this, I think daily GCC benchmarks, daily Linux kernel benchmarks,

536
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,960
what's driving you to do this?

537
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,320
What's the core reason?

538
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,240
What is the core benefit of making this information public and putting it out there like this?

539
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,340
Why not keep it some secret sauce you can use for special Phronix reports and things

540
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,340
like that?

541
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:29,040
It's mostly just being dissatisfied over all these years with how many regressions

542
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,240
still enter mainly the Linux kernel, but yeah, there's also regressions in many other projects

543
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:40,280
out there that there just isn't too much action being done about any upstream latest git trying

544
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:47,040
to be universal benchmarking because besides Red Hat not caring about gaming benchmarks,

545
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,680
they and other distribution vendors often just care about testing the kernels they're

546
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:55,240
going to ship in their next product as opposed to the very latest git code.

547
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,240
Right.

548
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:02,600
And so I feel like you touched on something that I have noticed is an undercurrent, an

549
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,360
undertone in your writing.

550
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:11,760
You I get the sense really hate regressions and you I think in some ways are driven to

551
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,360
find when regressions happen and point that out based on data to the best of your ability.

552
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,000
Do you feel finding regressions and helping people fix them, identify them, is that part

553
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,560
of what drives you to do all this benchmarking and do all of this?

554
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,520
Are you a regression hater?

555
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,940
I mostly just hate regressions, yes, but I'm just really interested in Linux hardware and

556
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,400
trying to ensure everything achieves their peak performance possible in your Linux.

557
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,640
This is the disconnect that I don't get.

558
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,040
So how does it not seems like then you would be in a position where you would be constantly

559
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,760
tormented because you're going to see regressions everywhere because that happens in software

560
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,640
development and they're right there out there for everybody to see an open source, but also

561
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,640
you've run the numbers.

562
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,040
A lot of times you can run the same benchmark for say an open GL application or a game and

563
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,560
get a much better result using a proprietary driver on Windows than you might get with

564
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,780
a proprietary driver on Linux.

565
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:08,280
So how does somebody who's constantly checking for the best performance and who has a little

566
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,760
bit of regression hate, how do you not just get frustrated with Linux?

567
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,300
Here you are almost 11 years into Ferronix, I would think by now you would have pulled

568
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,300
your hair out.

569
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:22,480
I've pulled plenty of hair out, but overall Linux performance is still pretty much on

570
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,400
par with Windows.

571
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,360
There's certainly some cases where it's not, but it's improving a lot and it is frustrating

572
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,440
though when you see such performance drives being made and then all of a sudden on the

573
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,080
next kernel release you see your battery power usage just go horribly and no one notices

574
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,240
it until after the kernel ships.

575
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,320
Yeah, I've always wondered when I'm reading that.

576
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,520
And so I think now with these benchmarks, I look at this and I think, I wonder if maybe

577
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,600
it's time to sort of try to incorporate these kinds of benchmarks into reviews even.

578
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,800
Do you see the possibility there for, where do you really see this going?

579
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:04,960
Do you see it more for hardware makers and big projects or do you see it more as more

580
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,280
used by the community?

581
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,280
Where do you see it going?

582
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,880
Is it more of a community effort or more of an enterprise effort?

583
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,160
In terms of linuxbenchmarking.com, it's a community effort, but with the Ferronix SysWee

584
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:21,160
Informatic, anyone is able to test out their own software on their own hardware and everything

585
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
along those lines.

586
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,960
And there's plenty of behind the firewall for automatic deployments for running all

587
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,640
these benchmarks that various companies use, but yes, for linuxbenchmarking.com it's mostly

588
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,360
just a community effort because I have to test out my latest code anyways that I'm shipping

589
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,920
to customers.

590
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,560
So I'm basically making all that data public and trying to be as most real world and applicable

591
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,520
to the community as possible and all this data that I have to produce anyways.

592
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,940
Well Michael, before we wrap up, I'm just curious, obviously you follow the Linux news

593
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:56,120
pretty closely, like big picture wise, what's going on out there in the last six months

594
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:02,160
or so or whatever that you find to be particularly interesting?

595
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,160
That's a very good question.

596
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,160
There's many things that's interesting to me right now.

597
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:12,540
LLVM and Clang continue to be quite interesting, particularly for how they're being adapted

598
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:18,880
by so many different projects and now with Vulkan as basically the next generation OpenGL,

599
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,600
but there's going to be the Sphere V2 LLVM converters, all these other LLVM based products

600
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,120
will now be able to easily interact with the GPU.

601
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,600
That's one interesting area that always excites me over the past few years.

602
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,960
Bluetooth Snappy tends to be a little bit interesting, I still have to read up a lot

603
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:41,360
more on it, but they have a lot of nice plans.

604
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,760
I've noticed too, you seem like a close follower of the Fedora project as well, what do you

605
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,040
think about where Fedora is going?

606
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,040
We're going to talk about Fedora 22 today.

607
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,560
I'm quite happy with Fedora 22 and Fedora 21 for that matter.

608
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,640
I've had Fedora 22 on a couple dozen systems now and it's running fairly nicely.

609
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,360
I've had that Nuovo regression that's a bit annoying, and the other day I had an issue

610
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,800
with the WiFi where I'm getting really awkward internet connection speeds out of it, but

611
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,760
aside from that Fedora 22 has been performing very nicely and it's quite stable.

612
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,680
I've tested it both under X11 and Wayland, and the Wayland experience has been pretty

613
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,800
much on par now with X11.

614
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,660
That's going to be a big story, and I could see a specific angle there for your site too.

615
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:31,140
As Wayland rolls out and more distributions start shipping it, there's going to be lots

616
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,280
of performance regressions, there's going to be lots of new territory there.

617
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,200
That's got to be a story you follow with some interest.

618
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,980
Yes, certainly, overall the performance under Wayland or X-Wayland for that matter is pretty

619
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:46,400
nice with X-Wayland right now on the gnome shell there's some issues just around full

620
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:52,240
screen apps not being redirected properly, so there's a performance penalty, but at least

621
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,280
according to the developers that should be fixed in due time, so there isn't anything

622
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,280
too major.

623
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:02,960
It's not like you're suddenly having the performance in half, it's just that it's down 10% or so.

624
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,800
I love that's where we're at.

625
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,800
That's great.

626
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,400
That's better than you might expect, I suppose.

627
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,680
Heaven's Revenge wanted to ask you a question, Michael, go ahead Heaven's, ask away.

628
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:20,680
Well with the new release of Clang 3.6 and LLVM 3.6, have you tried out the OpenMP support

629
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:26,520
as I have, and have running on my system using a few test programs, so do you have any benchmarks

630
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,120
coming up with the OpenMP support for Clang?

631
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:37,240
Yes, I will, a few months ago I did run some of Intel's OpenMP branch of LLVM and Clang,

632
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,200
and then now that everything is settling in Mayline, I am in the process of this week

633
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,240
running some new benchmarks, and we'll have those out either this week or next week.

634
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,080
That's one thing I'm so excited for, and I'm very relieved that they finally have it merged

635
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,080
into their master branch.

636
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:58,360
Yeah, it's very great, and then on LinuxBenchmarking.com is the latest LLVM and Clang benchmark results,

637
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,000
and just yesterday I updated the test scripts to make sure that it's installing the latest

638
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,120
OpenMP runtime libraries, so within the next day or two you might be able to see those

639
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:12,320
results for that dozen or so systems organically switch over to the OpenMP support.

640
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,320
That's really cool.

641
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,280
Derek Delvin, you had a question you wanted to ask, Michael.

642
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,280
Indeed.

643
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:23,600
I'd like to know what are the kinds of features that you would like to see coming to the kernel

644
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:31,040
so that it will help you better test and do what you usually do, because I'm interested

645
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
in that.

646
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:38,040
There isn't any one feature that I'd like right now, like the tracing features in the

647
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,320
kernel are going nicely and everything else.

648
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,840
It would be nice if there was some universally expected benchmark flag for the kernel and

649
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,920
user space that people would expect.

650
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,360
Like right now, between the different Linux graphics drivers for X11, they all have a

651
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,400
different option for how to disable basically vblank.

652
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,320
There's no standardized way of doing that, and of course you want to disable vblank,

653
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,280
but within the Fronix test suite and my scripts, I have to make sure that it accommodates every

654
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,480
driver and make sure it checks or not, and then writes to their proper name and whatnot.

655
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,360
There's no simple universal way to say, hey, we're going to benchmark, so basically make

656
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,960
it in performant mode.

657
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,960
That makes sense.

658
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,360
So, Michael, my last question for you came from Corky in the chat room, and just kind

659
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,760
of curious, what is your main daily Linux driver?

660
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,760
What is your setup?

661
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,960
What distro and what's it look like?

662
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,680
My distro right now is Fedora 21.

663
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,920
I'll upgrade to Fedora 22 in the next few days or a couple of weeks after I find out

664
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:40,280
if FedUp is working nicely since I know when Fedora 21 rolled out that FedUp had some issues.

665
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,000
So once I can be comfortable upgrading that, I'll do that.

666
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,720
On my main production system, I'm using Intel Haswell, or actually I know it's already

667
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,880
Broadwell, Ultrabook, and that's basically just using that driver since I'm not running

668
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,880
any games or anything graphically intensive on that system, and I can generally rely upon

669
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,840
the Intel graphics driver to not give me any regressions for mode setting and other key

670
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,680
functionality between the kernel releases.

671
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,680
Yeah.

672
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,680
Yeah.

673
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,840
When you can get by with the open source driver, it does make it really nice.

674
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,720
I ran into a snag in Fedora 22 that I'll talk about in our review in a little bit, but yeah,

675
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,600
that was one little snafu for me, but other than that, yeah, the open source driver, if

676
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,400
you're not gaming, I can't believe where it's at now.

677
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:31,200
Really between that and the Intel stuff, looking back at 11 years of this stuff, it has come

678
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
so far.

679
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,440
Just looking at the nine years we've been doing the Linux action show, it is fundamentally

680
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,440
different.

681
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,280
Listen to that discussion we had earlier about how you set up Mandrake to where it's at now

682
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,280
with these open source drivers.

683
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,280
It blows my mind.

684
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
Oh, right.

685
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Yeah.

686
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,840
I had a lot of fun reminiscing over that with the Mandrake sex config.

687
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,840
Yes.

688
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,840
Yeah.

689
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,840
Yeah, yeah.

690
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,640
Well, Michael, thanks so much for coming on and updating us.

691
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,520
Great initiative here, and folks, I want you to go check it out.

692
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,920
It's really cool, and we'll have links to all of it in the show notes.

693
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,920
It's linuxbenchmarking.com, right, Michael?

694
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,840
Yes, that's correct, but I also have linuxbenchmark.com, and pretty much any other variety should also

695
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
redirect there.

696
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Nice score.

697
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
No worries.

698
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,840
Wow, that's a good score.

699
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,360
That is some prime real estate right there.

700
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,080
You keep it up, and I'll be watching that.

701
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,840
I'm curious to see after you've been publishing these results for a while to see what kind

702
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,920
of trends show up and things like that, especially in some of our favorite projects.

703
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,260
And Michael, of course, you are always welcome to join us.

704
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,680
We have an open Mamba room, and you can stick around for the rest of the show if you'd like.

705
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,040
We're going to get into taking care of some little bit more transitions to Linux.

706
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,200
I tried to solve some issues for Angela and her Switch that really came down to compatibility

707
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,200
issues.

708
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
I'm going to talk about what I did and how they worked.

709
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,360
I've tried a couple of different suites, including Kingsoft, a different file format than Office

710
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,580
365.

711
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:52,160
And I tried to go all in when I did Office 365, integrate it into our desktop, give her

712
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,480
a dock icon, make it feel like a true Excel experience.

713
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,440
I'm going to tell you all about that here in a second, and then we're going to get into

714
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,200
our Fedora 22 review, which I'm really excited to talk about.

715
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,120
First, I've got to tell you something I'm super passionate about, and that's Digital

716
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,920
Ocean, the next sponsor of the Linux Unplugged program.

717
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,920
What?

718
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,120
You don't know what Digital Ocean is?

719
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,760
Digital Ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

720
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,500
easy way for you to spin up your own cloud server up in the sky.

721
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,780
You need root access on a box that's super fast, connected to tier one bandwidth based

722
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,780
on Linux.

723
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,480
All SSDs throughout, that's Digital Ocean, and the value is incredible.

724
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,240
You're going to get a root console.

725
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,920
You can go right up to that website, HTML5, Badmama, Jamma, Written in Go, you can watch

726
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,060
that thing from post all the way up to the login screen, and you can get your droplet

727
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,500
created in less than 55 seconds.

728
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:41,880
And pricing plans start at only $5 a month, a month, $5 a month for 512 megabytes of RAM,

729
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:49,560
a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte, a terabyte, a terabyte of transfer for $5

730
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,800
a month.

731
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,080
Like when it's that price, it's obvious why I have four of them, isn't it?

732
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,180
I mean, come on, hello, it's nuts.

733
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,760
And they have data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, Germany,

734
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,760
and London.

735
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,760
That one in Germany is brand new.

736
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,760
It's super hot.

737
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,080
They got great connectivity to all their neighbors.

738
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,680
The individual hypervisors have 40 gigabit E connections, the fastest SSDs they've ever

739
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,680
deployed.

740
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,640
You don't even have to put a droplet over there because it just sounds so dang fancy.

741
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,640
Seriously.

742
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,600
Plus, you know, help out our folks over in that neck of the woods, too.

743
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,080
But let's talk about how you manage DigitalOcean.

744
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,320
Because yeah, you know, 55 seconds is pretty badass, and the value is amazing, and the

745
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,120
fact that it's all based on Linux and KVM is super killer, and the fact that they have

746
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,840
great data centers everywhere is obviously essential.

747
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,720
But it's that icing on top of that cake, let's not lie, we all like that icing, and that's

748
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,360
DigitalOcean's interface.

749
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,480
Their simple intuitive control panel kicks butt, and PowerU is going to replicate it

750
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,320
on a much larger scale with DigitalOcean's straightforward API that they just revved.

751
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,600
Brand new revision of the API, and I love hearing about how you guys take advantage

752
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,000
of these APIs, and there's a ton of amazing applications.

753
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You know what?

754
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
You know what?

755
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I got to go look at some of these apps.

756
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,560
So here, go over to DigitalOcean.com right now, remember our code DOUNPLUGGED, and then

757
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,720
click on that community link right there, and then go over to the project section.

758
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,180
And when you're in the project section, look at all of these freaking amazing applications

759
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:09,740
written around the DigitalOcean API that you just get for being up on DigitalOcean.

760
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:15,120
There are so many really awesome apps that make using DigitalOcean blow your mind, like

761
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,160
stuff where you can just do incredible things from your phone, snap it right into your puppet

762
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,760
management infrastructure, your vagrant infrastructure, use Drizzle with it.

763
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,440
They have so many great little indicators for your desktops.

764
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,800
There's one in the Arch repository.

765
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,960
There's a PPA for the Ubuntu desktop.

766
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,920
So many cool tools built by the community around this API that you just get for free.

767
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,640
And then they have a ton of really great tutorials, I mean, not just great, the best tutorials

768
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,440
on the web, how to set up SSH keys, how to set up open VPN server on Ubuntu 14.04, all

769
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,480
free, all up on the DigitalOcean website.

770
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,480
And you know what else?

771
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,700
They want to double down on that.

772
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,000
So they're hiring content editors.

773
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,220
In fact, if you're a technical writer, go get a job at DigitalOcean, because they're

774
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,920
serious about this stuff.

775
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,760
And this is the kind of company you want to work for, where they really see the value

776
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,900
in this kind of content.

777
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,720
So they're hiring editors, and they're paying people to write for them too.

778
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
They're back at it again.

779
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,880
They're taking more entries.

780
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,880
Go check it out.

781
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,200
They're a Linux sysadmin.

782
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,660
They're also hiring those.

783
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,240
So there's so many great opportunities over DigitalOcean.

784
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,000
They're an awesome company, built their entire business around Linux.

785
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,240
And if you use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, one word lowercase, you'll get a $10 credit

786
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,300
tryout, that $5 rig, two months for free.

787
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,900
You guys, it's crazy nuts.

788
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,900
It's so much fun.

789
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,900
They're super fast.

790
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,900
They have local repos.

791
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,900
So those updates, they blow your mind.

792
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,900
I'm not even kidding.

793
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,900
Go try it out.

794
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,600
Go create a droplet and install the updates.

795
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,600
That alone will blow your mind.

796
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,280
DigitalOcean.com, DOUNPLUGGED, go create something cool.

797
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,920
My last droplet was a Minecraft server for my wife and son.

798
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,420
They fricking love it.

799
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:36,240
And before they do something crazy, I just take a snapshot.

800
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,680
It's all possible with a straightforward, super simple interface.

801
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,560
DigitalOcean.com, promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

802
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,160
And a huge thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

803
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,600
You guys rock.

804
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,040
You're on fire.

805
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,040
Love it.

806
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,040
DigitalOcean.com, DOUNPLUGGED.

807
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,720
You guys are wrecking it up.

808
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,720
Okay, Noah.

809
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,360
So, Ange came to me and she said, honey, I can't pay the bills.

810
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,680
And that wasn't a good thing to hear from the wife.

811
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,520
And it's this damn Linux.

812
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,960
And you never want to hear this when you're trying to switch a new user over to Linux.

813
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:14,340
So the problem was is she had a pretty fancy spreadsheet that she created in a newer version

814
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,340
of Excel.

815
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:19,320
It was a.xls file, xl, xlsx.

816
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,440
And this is like an imitation of LibreOfficeCoke?

817
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,440
Yeah.

818
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,640
And basically it's like a knockoff, but they've sort of messed up the UI really bad, so it's

819
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,640
hard to use.

820
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,640
I don't know if you've seen this.

821
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,640
I see.

822
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,000
They just have these huge buttons across the top.

823
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,520
And it's more recent.

824
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:39,380
And the other thing is, this is really weird, but it's like this standalone binary application.

825
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,240
It's not available in any repo.

826
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,160
And you have to buy it directly from this Microsoft company.

827
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,040
And then you can download it, but you have to run this weird proprietary installer that

828
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,120
doesn't add it to your package repo.

829
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,120
Really?

830
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,620
And they're not even Linux executables.

831
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,800
So that was a huge way.

832
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,800
So that didn't work out.

833
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,040
I couldn't go in with Microsoft Office.

834
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,040
But then...

835
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,040
It sounds like that company's out of touch with reality.

836
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,040
I know, right?

837
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,000
Well, then I found out they're trying this new thing called Office 365, an online version

838
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,040
of Microsoft Office.

839
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,680
So like a ripoff of Google Docs.

840
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,680
Right.

841
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,640
Actually, so I went for the business essentials, because I'm a business, and I had business

842
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,640
to take care of.

843
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,000
So it's $5 a month or about like $60 if you buy it for a year or something like that.

844
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,360
And I'm thinking, I'm getting this for her, because you know what, I want to stay on Linux.

845
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:29,000
And if the price I have to pay is $60, so that way she gets access to Office, then I

846
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,560
never have to worry about this again.

847
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,560
Right?

848
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,560
That's...

849
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,560
It's worth five times that.

850
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,560
Yeah, right?

851
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,560
Right.

852
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,560
That's what I was thinking.

853
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,560
That's exactly what I was thinking.

854
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,680
Then I discovered when you pay $5 a month, you don't just get like Google Docs and Google

855
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,680
Spreadsheets.

856
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,680
Like that's all I wanted for $5 a month.

857
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,040
In fact, I didn't want anything more than that.

858
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,440
You get like the entire Microsoft business enterprise suite.

859
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
You get like Active Directory on demand.

860
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,500
You get Exchange.

861
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,920
You get MobileSync.

862
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,840
You get provisioning of user accounts.

863
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,960
You get calendaring, groupware.

864
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,040
You get shared OneDrive storage.

865
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,400
You get your own customized domain for all of it.

866
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,880
You can do branding with all of it.

867
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:09,080
Like it is this massive, total, overarching competitor to Google Apps for business.

868
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,480
It is a beast of a service.

869
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,880
And she has every...

870
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,940
She has her own Exchange server now.

871
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,940
Like every...

872
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,840
So you don't just get Office, which was a little intense.

873
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:26,520
It was more than I really wanted, but nonetheless, I log in and I discover that you can't upload,

874
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:32,000
at least from what I could tell, you can't upload into Excel from the local file system.

875
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,760
The only way to open up an existing document in Word or Excel online is to either import

876
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,200
it from Dropbox or to open it off of OneDrive.

877
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,200
Yeah.

878
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,120
I was going to say, I think that is their prescribed method, right?

879
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:49,000
Put the document into OneDrive and then you can access it through the...

880
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Yeah.

881
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
But you see the slippery slope I'm on.

882
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,400
So I go from, I'd like my wife to be able to open up the spreadsheet to now my wife

883
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,640
is a OneDrive user.

884
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,480
She's uploading files to OneDrive.

885
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,120
She's importing them into Excel.

886
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,080
Like it's just this slippery lock-in slope.

887
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:07,160
So to be clear, so your expectation was that she would have the file locally, but able

888
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,520
to edit it and manipulate it in the...

889
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,520
I guess because...

890
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,520
I feel like that's a little unrealistic.

891
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,920
Yeah, because in Google Docs, you can upload a file directly into Google Docs and yes,

892
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,560
then it's stored in Google Drive, but I don't know.

893
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,360
So it's semantics then at that point, you're uploading it to OneDrive or you're uploading

894
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,360
it to Office 365.

895
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,640
But for her, the semantics matter because you have to upload to OneDrive first.

896
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:30,200
So from a user perspective, you have to go to the OneDrive area, upload a file, and then

897
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,200
you can...

898
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,720
But in theory, you should spend maybe 10 minutes picking files that she needs to use and put

899
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,720
those up.

900
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,840
And then once they're there, you should never need to pull them back down.

901
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,760
Everything should just remain there and you edit them, right?

902
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,760
Yeah, I think so.

903
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,760
And if you ever create a new document, it's always going to automatically be saved in

904
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,760
OneDrive.

905
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,760
Yes, that's true.

906
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,280
But see, then this is also what I'm concerned about.

907
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,040
See, I was hoping she'd be able to download them locally and save them in our own cloud

908
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,560
folder.

909
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:01,560
And see, now what I'm worried about is this OneDrive stuff is sort of wedging out the

910
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,480
own cloud usage because now I've got...

911
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,480
Yeah.

912
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:10,960
So, to summarize, you went to Microsoft and expected to be able to integrate Microsoft

913
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,440
solution with another open source solution.

914
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,440
I know.

915
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,240
That was the recommendation of the mom room last time we talked about.

916
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,240
You know what I really wanted?

917
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,240
It's a good recommendation.

918
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,240
It's a good recommendation.

919
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,240
It will solve the problem.

920
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,240
I think.

921
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,000
What I want is I want to go to docs.microsoft.com and I want a Word editor in my web browser.

922
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I actually want Spreadsheet.

923
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I guess I want spreads.microsoft.

924
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Because she just needs to be able to pump up a spreadsheet.

925
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Right.

926
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Right.

927
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Okay.

928
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,560
But I just wanted to walk you through my logic train on this, like why I was going down

929
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,040
the Office 365 route.

930
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,040
Right.

931
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,240
So, just to complete the picture because I did try something else and I'm going to tell

932
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,240
you about that.

933
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,240
And this is I think going to be my recommendation.

934
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,240
But just to complete the Office 365 picture, what I opted to do is I went into Chrome and

935
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:52,040
I made the Office 365 site a standalone app for Excel.

936
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:57,880
And so, I was able to put an Excel icon down in her GNOME doc and she has a little Excel

937
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,520
icon that when she clicks, it opens up a dedicated Chrome window and launches what looks a lot

938
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,520
like Excel.

939
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,520
That's awesome.

940
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:09,320
So, yeah, it's not a one-to-one, but she launched it and she dug it and she thought it was okay.

941
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,360
And what's great about that is you say it's not a one-to-one, but the reality is Microsoft

942
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:18,480
changes Microsoft Office so freaking gosh darn much that really what is one-to-one now would

943
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,240
not be one-to-one in nine months anyway.

944
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,480
Well, and for her, I think in a way this works because she still has a Mac, although she

945
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,480
hasn't been using it very much.

946
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,440
But if she did move back or wanted to use it for something, the files would be there

947
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,240
I guess and I don't have to worry about getting Office for her stupid Mac now, so that's good

948
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,240
I guess.

949
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,240
Yeah.

950
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,120
I'm not like thrilled about it, but…

951
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,640
So if we talk about the lesser of two evils, 365 is very much the lesser of two evils between

952
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,400
that and the actual Office Suite for a number of reasons.

953
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,640
One is like you said, it works on Linux.

954
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,620
And two, you're going to upgrade your regular Office Suite for the $300 or $400 or whatever

955
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:58,960
it is anyway and then you get four years of use essentially before you have to upgrade.

956
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,040
The reality is most businesses are upgrading every one if not two years at most and so

957
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,560
now you're getting that if it's really, would you say $60 a year?

958
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,940
That's actually a pretty competitive offering.

959
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:13,640
It's not bad if you figure it's kind of a business standard and it's nice to be able

960
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,560
to say you can do this under Linux now.

961
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,280
So I totally dig that.

962
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,000
There is another route that I'm going to have her try for a little bit and see what she

963
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,600
thinks and only she can really tell me about the true compatibility because I've tried

964
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,300
to open up her spreadsheets and I'm a total spreadsheet idiot and they look like they

965
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,480
work fine to me.

966
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,620
But it's Kingsoft Office and they have like a very competitive, I know you're pretty familiar

967
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,620
with this, right?

968
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:40,200
They have a competitive looking spreadsheet program that in some ways has sort of a ribbon

969
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,200
UI.

970
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,400
It's supposed to have fantastic compatibility with Excel spreadsheets.

971
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,320
It comes out of China so some people are a little uncomfortable with that I guess.

972
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:54,480
And it has like full importing of the more recent 2010 style files.

973
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,000
You can switch and toggle between different UI styles which is kind of neat and it has

974
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,120
the benefit of being a local app and it's free.

975
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,880
It's not open source but it's cost free.

976
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:10,060
So it's in the Arch Repos like WPS Office I think, yeah WPS-Office is the Arch Repo

977
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,060
package.

978
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:17,720
So it's called WPS Office now and it, I don't know if you have the video version up Noah

979
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:23,880
but it looks like a, it's definitely got a nicer UI even than say Open Office does.

980
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,640
We talked about it at last a couple of weeks ago and I looked into it then.

981
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,000
Now did you look into Collegra?

982
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,840
I haven't looked into Collegra, no.

983
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,840
No I haven't done that.

984
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,840
Okay that's the other one that I'm talking about.

985
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,600
I haven't personally used it but I've been told now by three different people that were

986
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,560
previously Microsoft Office users that said LibreOffice wasn't cutting it for them but

987
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,560
Collegra did it.

988
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,560
I actually looked at that too.

989
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,880
Kingslow, this is looking really solid.

990
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:53,280
And the downside again, Collegra is to the best of my knowledge, it's not open source.

991
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,960
Oh it's not?

992
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,200
Well see here's the thing, I remember it came from KOffice so I always thought it was but

993
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,200
somebody told me.

994
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,240
No, I'm pretty sure it did.

995
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,320
It was the old KOffice and that's one of the reasons I haven't done this because she doesn't

996
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,960
have very much QT stuff on her system.

997
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:12,560
But I would install all the QT for the KDU4 based libraries but Collegra itself should

998
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,280
work always fine for me.

999
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
So yeah.

1000
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,280
I give it a go.

1001
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,060
So they, yeah it looks like the chat room agrees, they say oh wait no, Ram says it has

1002
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,680
worse compatibility compared to LibreOffice.

1003
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,040
Well I don't mind installing it on my machine and giving it a go for her but right now I

1004
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,840
know she can get it done with Office 365.

1005
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,040
Like I know that works so I feel pretty good about that.

1006
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,720
The only thing I'm a little worried about is it sort of negates her need for own cloud

1007
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,560
a little bit or I'm going to say hey Ange, I now need you to use OneDrive, own cloud

1008
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,560
and Dropbox.

1009
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:45,820
It's a bit of a mess so I need to kind of work that out but I feel like this is some

1010
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:49,720
good insights I'm getting to help other potential Linux switchers out there in the audience

1011
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,720
in the future.

1012
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,240
So they're good little bumps to hit.

1013
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,000
They're not unsolvable but they're stuff that if maybe you didn't have somebody helping

1014
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,120
you would be a big sticky point and so if we can learn these things then maybe we can

1015
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,240
help people make that transition.

1016
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:06,000
So WPS Office is one and if you don't mind giving Microsoft some of your hard-earned

1017
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,840
dollars or whatever your currency is, Office 365, at least make it a business write-off

1018
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,400
for God's sakes people, that's what I did, geez.

1019
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:22,640
And I got to say if you're a little Google paranoid you could totally, literally you

1020
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,920
get Outlook, you get Active Directory, you get everything.

1021
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:31,840
You get all the Microsoft stuff for five bucks a month and then you go like nine bucks a

1022
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,640
month and you get some other crap too like you get the actual like desktop apps and crap

1023
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,640
like that.

1024
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,800
So the five dollar a month is just the web apps from Microsoft which if you're a Linux

1025
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,360
user that's fine, that's all you need.

1026
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:47,440
If you've got some Windows in your life, I'm not going to judge you that much but you can

1027
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,440
pay nine bucks.

1028
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,520
That's funny, that's funny, you'd think the people running Windows would get a cheaper

1029
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,520
deal.

1030
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:59,880
So anyways, wps-community.org for the Kingsoft version of the WPS Office, that's wps-community.org

1031
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,280
and you can Google search for Office 365 and good luck to you because they've got like

1032
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,920
a hundred different websites you can land on to order that crap.

1033
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,200
It's like all other Microsoft products, it's super confusing.

1034
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:15,000
But yeah, other than that, other than that one small complaint, I think she's actually

1035
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
going to be okay.

1036
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,440
I think we're finally sort of in the green, Noah.

1037
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,280
The one thing we have to work out is the drive space issue, that's getting a little tight.

1038
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,180
And really, actually if you think about it, really that's more of a monetary issue than

1039
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:33,200
everything else because we can, I'm just looking here, we can order an M.2 drive and she had

1040
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,200
a one terabyte before?

1041
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,280
Yeah.

1042
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:40,280
So I don't know if they make one quite that big, well they do, Samsung has the Evo, it

1043
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,720
is $465 so we can get a one terabyte.

1044
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,320
I wonder if they, I wonder what she would need.

1045
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,640
She and I have been talking about changing her photos to drop that down and maybe we

1046
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,720
can get by with a 512, but I'll talk to her tonight about that, see what she wants to

1047
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,720
do.

1048
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,720
Yeah, if we do a five, that cuts the price in almost half, it's $265.

1049
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,760
Maybe we pick that up and fries when you're down here this weekend.

1050
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,760
Yeah, yep.

1051
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:04,680
Noah's going to be in town for the Linux Action Show on Sunday and I got a few things I'm

1052
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,200
doing to get ready around here for you because I know you have some shenanigans in the works.

1053
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,440
What kind of shenanigans are you up to while you're out here this weekend?

1054
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:16,360
I have, well here's the thing, I had more shenanigans when I originally started planning

1055
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,680
this trip because the original thing I was going to do was, well I was going to build

1056
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:24,320
a box to fix your HDMI capture and then fix the nook, but actually sounds like for the

1057
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,000
most part you got the nook thing straightened out thanks to system 76.

1058
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,500
Yeah, at least for now I'm using their Miracat, although I do have to send it back at some

1059
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,500
point.

1060
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:36,880
Right, well so maybe we'll still tackle that and then I need to fix that other HDMI capture

1061
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,280
because even if we have it replaced, we can either use it as a backer or we can put it

1062
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,520
in the mobile production rack.

1063
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:47,120
You know what would be an awesome, totally crazy, not going to happen stretch goal?

1064
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,120
What's that?

1065
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:52,600
Is if we could dig up some extra hardware around here and put OBS on it and give me

1066
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,560
that secondary streaming machine so I don't have to reboot the stream anymore between

1067
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,560
shows.

1068
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,560
Okay, it's going to happen.

1069
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,640
Because then we would have our live stream powered by Linux.

1070
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,000
I just decided it's going to happen.

1071
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,160
Well, it's a stretch goal, but I think we might be able to make it this weekend.

1072
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,760
I don't know if we have the hardware for it, but maybe we can move things around.

1073
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,760
It's going to happen.

1074
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,760
We'll see, we'll see.

1075
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,760
So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

1076
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,760
So Noah will be in studio.

1077
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,440
You know what's funny though?

1078
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,160
Rotten went to all that trouble to make that really great art, the frames, which we're

1079
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,600
tweaking like my look and Noah's look still, but the frames themselves look amazing on

1080
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,940
this week's episode of Linux Actual.

1081
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:26,520
Thank you Rottencorpz again for making some great frames for us so we have a nice consistent

1082
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,020
look for the show now.

1083
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:31,520
And of course, we finally get it rolled out and now Noah's going to be in studio.

1084
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,600
So I don't know how that's going to work.

1085
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,720
So I mean, yeah, we can have a tweak those frames, but the reality is I might be there

1086
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:41,200
this week, but the remaining 50 some weeks in the year, yeah, yeah, right.

1087
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,200
I don't know.

1088
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,200
No, it's good.

1089
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,720
It's just ironic that we finally got that all in and then the next following episode,

1090
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,120
we're going to probably undo it because it doesn't really fit for, yeah.

1091
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,120
But I don't know.

1092
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,680
In that case, I'll just make one.

1093
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,280
I'll make an extra overlay for it when he's in.

1094
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,280
Like a one shot camera?

1095
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,400
Because yeah, we're both on one camera in that one.

1096
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,400
Yeah.

1097
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,400
Yeah.

1098
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,400
It's kind of, but it's going to be fun.

1099
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,840
And it's going to be a packed episode because we'll be doing the Fedora 22 review and we're

1100
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:11,040
going to interview the folks from the Autotest site, right, Rottencorpz?

1101
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,040
Is that Autotest?

1102
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,040
Is that what it is?

1103
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,040
I'm blanking on his name.

1104
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,040
Yeah.

1105
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,040
Autotest.

1106
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,040
Yeah.

1107
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,040
And these are the folks.

1108
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,040
Lucas.

1109
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,040
Lucas.

1110
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,040
Thank you.

1111
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,040
Lucas from Autotest.

1112
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,640
Autotest is the project behind the automated testing of the Linux kernel, Ubuntu, Red Hat.

1113
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,680
Like whenever, like you hear a big project saying, we automatically test our builds for

1114
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,440
automated QA every single day to ensure quality.

1115
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,720
When you hear them say that, they're probably using Autotest.

1116
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,480
So we want to talk to Lucas and say, hey, you know, you are the folks behind all of

1117
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,880
these projects that we depend on and making sure that they are doing build really good

1118
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:40,880
solid builds.

1119
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,520
And hey, by the way, this is really important for rolling software too.

1120
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,820
Obviously that's my angle a little bit.

1121
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:48,580
So we want to talk to Lucas this Sunday, which is great, right?

1122
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:53,200
Because so on Sunday, we're going to talk to Lucas about auto testing for build quality.

1123
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,280
And today on Unplugged, we talked to Michael about benchmarking.

1124
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,680
Two sort of similar veins and I thought it's great.

1125
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,400
If you are, if you listen to both shows, I think they're going to fit together together

1126
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,400
really well.

1127
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,400
But here's the catch.

1128
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:08,920
That interview with Lucas is probably going to air in a couple of weeks or a week or so.

1129
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,360
We'll probably air the Fedora 22 review this Sunday.

1130
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,080
So if you show up live, you're going to get extra show because we're only going to air

1131
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,520
one of the two segments first.

1132
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:20,000
And but we'll record them both this Sunday since Noah's going to be in studio with the

1133
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,640
Fedora 22 review and that interview.

1134
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,840
Join us on Sunday, jblive.tv, 10 a.m. Pacific, then the photo show after that.

1135
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,360
Go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that in your local time zone.

1136
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:36,040
I also just wanted to give a mention, Ange was intending to join us for the ThinkPad

1137
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:42,000
transition of the Linux switch update because she has a lot more to share.

1138
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,080
But her mom is in the hospital today and she needed to be with her.

1139
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:50,840
So my thoughts are with Ange and her mom and she will hopefully join us maybe next Tuesday

1140
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,680
because it's it's fun to see her enjoy it.

1141
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,920
You know, I come down, I mean, every now and then like she runs into issues and I'm like,

1142
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:58,920
oh, I'm sorry.

1143
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,920
I'll fix that.

1144
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,800
But more often than not, she's smiling, which is pretty, pretty fun because if you guys

1145
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,120
listen for a while, you know, this is not always worked out so well.

1146
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,880
So it's kind of a nice change of pace to have her say, oh, this is so cool.

1147
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,800
I love how it does X.

1148
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,720
So maybe we'll get her to share some of that when she joins us next Tuesday.

1149
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,040
In the meantime, though, I want to tell you about something you should try out and then

1150
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,680
we'll get to Fedora 22 and that is Linux Academy.

1151
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,680
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged right now.

1152
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,320
Once you go there right now to get our special discount, you go to linuxacademy.com slash

1153
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,980
unplugged and you get a 33 percent discount.

1154
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:34,160
Linux Academy is a great service set up by people that had a vision before I did.

1155
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,200
I wish I would have thought of this.

1156
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,560
This is totally brilliant.

1157
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:40,320
It's created by people truly enthusiast, truly enthusiastic and passionate about Linux and

1158
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:45,120
open source and all of the technology in the ecosystem around that.

1159
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,020
Why do I tell you that?

1160
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,020
Why does that matter?

1161
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:51,840
Why am I telling you that when this is a training website designed for people who love Linux?

1162
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,120
Because there's a lot of training resources online.

1163
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,800
There's crappy YouTube videos.

1164
00:58:55,800 --> 00:59:00,520
There's generalist sites that get paid billions because they teach you everything from fixing

1165
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:04,760
your refrigerator to changing the tire on your car to Adobe After Effects and there

1166
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:09,680
is a place in the market for that, obviously, but that's not what you need.

1167
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,080
You need stuff created by people that truly care about Linux and open source.

1168
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,720
You guys know that makes a difference and that's why I tell you where Linux Academy

1169
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,760
comes from.

1170
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,400
Before we brought them on as a sponsor, I sat down on the phone with them and talked

1171
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:25,200
for a long time about where they came from, what their passions were, where they're going,

1172
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,120
why they're doing this and in fact, we actually hit the pause button a little bit early on

1173
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,760
in our relationship and we said, why don't we hit pause because you guys are about to

1174
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,720
do something really cool and I'll tell you what that is in just a second.

1175
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,520
Once you do that, I think you're going to be perfect for my audience and we waited a

1176
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:42,080
couple of months and they rolled that out and they were really on the ball with this

1177
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,080
whole thing.

1178
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:47,000
They told us what their vision was and man, they didn't only execute on that.

1179
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,480
They overshot and they achieved even more so I was super impressed.

1180
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:53,000
We brought them in as a sponsor right away and they've been with us every single week

1181
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,680
since then because they're perfect.

1182
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,680
Here's the feature they were working on that I knew you guys were going to love is they

1183
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,520
were working on integrating their lab system to spin up automatically in the courseware.

1184
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,880
You just get to that spot in the courseware and the virtual machines just start up in

1185
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,480
the back end, give you an SSH login and you're working on a real Linux box.

1186
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,600
But the part that was really genius is they said, we're going to have it so you can choose

1187
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,640
any Linux distro in your courseware so the system is smart enough where if you chose

1188
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:22,040
CentOS or you chose Debian for your courseware, when it gets to that part in the courseware,

1189
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:27,600
then they'll just spin up a Debian VM or a CentOS VM and then almost every week that

1190
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,160
we have a spot, there's something new to talk about.

1191
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:33,800
I love these nuggets, these single how-tos and just get in there and do something real

1192
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,800
quick.

1193
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,800
In fact, check this out.

1194
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,800
They just updated it.

1195
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:40,880
If you go to linuxacademy.com, start by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged but then

1196
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,840
check out their nuggets section.

1197
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,200
We've been adding this all the time because it's quick contents, you don't have to have

1198
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,120
a whole course on it, just something you need to know to make you better at doing your job,

1199
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:52,760
make you faster at doing your job, make you a little more confident at doing your job

1200
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,720
or maybe help you learn something so you can get a new job.

1201
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:59,640
So if you go to linuxacademy.com slash nuggets, here's a new one they just posted, virtual

1202
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,240
box, clone a VM and change the UUID using the command line.

1203
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:07,880
Here's another virtual box, running a headless VM mode, building a firewall with IP tables,

1204
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,880
another quick nugget.

1205
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,880
How great is that?

1206
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,880
You can do quick video courses and when you log in, you just take it and watch it and

1207
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,040
you're done.

1208
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,480
Creating a pixie boot server, setting up linux single sign-ons, all this stuff.

1209
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,480
Look at all these freaking nuggets they have over here.

1210
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,880
You could just spend all your time right there if you wanted to and just learn individual

1211
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:27,160
things and get better at each thing, setting up SSH keys, editing an ISO image, working

1212
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:31,320
with DOS box, securing SSH, I love that one, configuring Linux kernel parameters, writing

1213
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,780
custom Java services, how Nmap can be used to compromise your system, how NetStack can

1214
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:39,560
be used to compromise your system, MD5 checksums and how to use them.

1215
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:42,800
All individual topics that we could all probably stand a little bit more on.

1216
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,800
Linuxacademy.com slash nuggets to see those.

1217
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:49,120
Start by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, you get our 33% discount, they have new stuff

1218
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:52,960
they're rolling out all the time, like the new DevOps courseware, the Red Hat certified

1219
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:57,560
stuff, the AWS stuff is always being updated, first on the scene with Docker and the best

1220
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,360
material on Docker, all of it.

1221
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,360
Linuxacademy, more than that.

1222
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:03,240
I literally could spend the whole show telling you it all.

1223
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,560
They have an unbelievable amount of content and that's why the subscription service makes

1224
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,560
so much sense.

1225
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:10,000
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy for freaking rocking

1226
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,600
our face with the awesome support and creating a service that's truly great for Linux users.

1227
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,200
I really love being able to say that.

1228
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,200
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1229
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:26,320
Alright so Fedora 22 is installed on a, System76 was very nice to send me a test bonobo, it's

1230
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:30,480
like a couple of generations old, but that's fine, it's like a core i7 with, I think it

1231
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:36,760
has 120 gigabyte SSD in it, I think it has 8 gigabytes of RAM in it, an NVIDIA 7 series

1232
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:42,560
GPU dedicated, 17 inch screen, really nice laptop, I love the bonobo series.

1233
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:46,440
So this is such a good machine to test this stuff on, absolutely love it.

1234
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:50,960
So today Fedora 22, or was it yesterday, no it's today, Fedora 22 was released and we'll

1235
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:56,040
be talking mostly about the workstation spin, of course the big feature in Fedora 22 is

1236
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:01,160
GNOME 3.16 which means you're gonna get them new notifications, that little bar down at

1237
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:05,360
the bottom is gone now and your icons are off in this little tray area off to the side,

1238
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:09,960
I happen to like it, I know some people freaking hate it, and they've done a few tweaks to

1239
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,720
the default GNOME setup that you don't get on your standard GNOME desktop.

1240
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,880
The one that you don't care about is that little Fedora logo that's in the bottom of

1241
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:22,920
the corner is actually an extension, so whatever background you change I believe it stays overlaid.

1242
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,740
I thought that was kind of interesting.

1243
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:29,140
They've done a few other tweaks too like when your terminal completes a command, it'll generate

1244
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:32,960
a notification using the new GNOME notification system, that's a Fedora specific tweak, that

1245
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,360
is not in general GNOME, I thought that was kind of an interesting little, like where

1246
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,840
they chose to make their tweaks was kind of funny.

1247
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:43,240
Of course GNOME 3.16's backend has better OpenGL support, you have the improved Edwardia

1248
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:47,160
themes, GNOME's image viewer has been redesigned, files now comes with bigger icons, thumbnails

1249
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:53,440
by default, re-run as menus, this is cool, I really love to see Fedora doing this, installation

1250
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:58,400
of GStreamer codecs, fonts, and certain document types now handled by software.

1251
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:05,480
And this is where I realized Fedora's, for me as an end user, Fedora's edge comes up

1252
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,440
over distributions like Arch.

1253
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:12,240
All this stuff I just said, except for the terminal completion thing, it's been in Arch

1254
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,000
for weeks.

1255
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:21,540
But what Arch can't do is sort of have a unilateral decision on how we're going to deliver something

1256
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:24,560
and everything pivots and does that now.

1257
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:28,680
And what Fedora does, like when they rolled out GNOME software, well that's just how you

1258
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:30,720
get stuff now.

1259
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:37,360
You know, like codecs, you need something installed, updates, everything is just done

1260
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:38,840
through GNOME software.

1261
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:44,780
So with Fedora, not only do you get the latest and greatest software like GNOME 3.16 and

1262
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:50,300
all these great improvements, but it's presented in a way where it feels like a more cohesive

1263
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:54,880
package than it does when you put it together yourself.

1264
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:00,040
And so my initial impressions with Fedora are really positive.

1265
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:04,360
I'm starting to finally become a little more comfortable with the installer.

1266
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:08,000
I have a little bit of complaints still about how you'd partition with the installer, but

1267
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,560
the installer's looking pretty good.

1268
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,200
All of it's pretty nice, pretty fast, graphical boot's pretty good.

1269
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,880
I did have a major technical snafu.

1270
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,480
I'm going to tell you guys about that.

1271
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:21,360
Before I get into that part, does anybody have any Fedora 22 experiences in the Mumble

1272
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:25,120
Room they want to share with us?

1273
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:28,800
So I've been playing with Fedora a little bit.

1274
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:35,120
I haven't downloaded the official ISO yet, I was just playing with the beta one.

1275
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,920
But have you had a chance to play with DNF at all?

1276
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,440
Yeah, I've only installed a few things with DNF, but there's a couple of interesting things

1277
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,440
about it.

1278
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,440
Yeah, thanks for bringing that up.

1279
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,480
Yeah, DNF seems to be faster.

1280
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,640
There's a couple other things that I thought was interesting about DNF.

1281
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:54,220
Updates that don't work, like a bad update or something, it's just totally skipped.

1282
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:57,880
Before in YUM, you had to do dash dash skip dash broken, but now DNF just does that by

1283
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,880
default.

1284
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,880
Repositories, the 404, DNF doesn't lose its crap, it just skips right over them, doesn't

1285
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,720
care, which is nice because some of the RPM Fusion stuff isn't up to date.

1286
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:11,080
There's a few repos for Fedora 22 that aren't up to date, I think Fusion is now.

1287
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:15,080
When you remove a package with DNF, it will automatically remove any dependent packages

1288
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,840
that were not explicitly installed by the user.

1289
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,860
This one, I wonder if it's biting me in the ass, because I feel like I couldn't get my

1290
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:22,640
software installed at one point.

1291
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:28,920
DNF will check for updates in the background every hour... Wait, no, I'm sorry.

1292
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:33,960
By default, DNF will check for updates in configured repositories hourly, starting 10

1293
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,200
minutes after the system boots.

1294
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:40,520
After your first 10 minutes, and then every hour after that, it checks for updates.

1295
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:49,480
I don't know if this is why, but I launched software, and I tried to install a re-edit,

1296
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,560
a re-text, whatever, the markdown editor, and it just hung.

1297
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,560
It never installed.

1298
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,600
I was wondering if maybe it was because DNF was trying to do an update in the background

1299
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,900
too to check for updates.

1300
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:05,440
What's really nice is the GNOME software, so when I search, so if I do gparted in search,

1301
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,280
it's doing a really instant good job of pulling results out of GNOME software too.

1302
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:14,320
If I don't have gparted installed, it'll show up, and it's just one click, and it's installed.

1303
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,820
No password has to be entered, nothing.

1304
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:19,920
It's really nice.

1305
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,760
That's largely why I like to stick with Fedora, at least on one of my machines, and why I

1306
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:29,900
kind of consider it my main distro, is because I do so much work in the server sphere where

1307
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,560
we have so much Red Hat Enterprise.

1308
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,800
YUM is going to die.

1309
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:37,560
DNF is going to be the eventual replacement for it.

1310
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:43,120
In Fedora 22, the YUM command is symlinked to DNF now, and then it gives you a warning

1311
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,920
saying YUM is deprecated.

1312
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,040
The same thing happened with the service command, right?

1313
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:51,240
I don't know if this still works in Fedora, but it definitely works in Red Hat 7.

1314
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:57,320
If you type in service sshd stop, it redirects that to system control, which is great for

1315
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,400
people like me.

1316
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:04,240
So I'm going to use DNF now for a couple years before RHEL 8 comes out, and when RHEL 8 comes

1317
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:08,800
out and everyone's going, oh, well, and this is assuming they've replaced YUM with DNF

1318
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,960
in RHEL 8, if that happens and everyone else is saying, oh, this is something new, I'm

1319
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:16,920
going to say, well, I actually have been playing with it for three years, so it's great.

1320
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:21,320
And that is fundamentally why I continue to use Fedora.

1321
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:26,480
So a couple of big changes for graphical desktops have hit this version, and I think some people

1322
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,320
have hit some snags with those, and that's where one of my snags was.

1323
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:31,520
Oh, Minimac, I wanted to give you a chance to chime in.

1324
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,520
Go ahead.

1325
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,000
Oh, yeah, actually, this is exactly the line where I was going next.

1326
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Lib input, yes.

1327
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Exactly.

1328
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Jump in on that, would you?

1329
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,120
Yeah, I would like to.

1330
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:50,040
So as I told you before, I'm running this on a Chromebook, Acer C720P, and the touchpad

1331
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:56,700
was not the best one using the Synaptics driver, and it's working quite better with Lib input,

1332
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:00,360
but Lib input has less features than Synaptic has.

1333
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:06,560
So some people that are upgrading from Fedora 21 to Fedora 22 will have some problems using

1334
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:11,000
their touchpad in the normal way they were using it before.

1335
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,320
Yeah, I noticed immediately under the Bonobo that the touchpad has worked like there's

1336
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,220
just something different about it.

1337
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:21,880
It feels like maybe they put butter underneath my mouse cursor.

1338
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:23,040
It just is a little smoother.

1339
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,960
It feels like it's really locked onto my finger.

1340
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,280
I like the speed.

1341
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,440
I've heard complaints, though.

1342
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,280
I've heard people complaining the speed doesn't work for them.

1343
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,280
It's a little glitchy.

1344
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:33,520
On the Bonobo, it's great.

1345
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,520
Lib input is great.

1346
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:37,680
I don't know what it's going to be like now going back to other distros.

1347
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:40,300
I think I'm going to notice a difference.

1348
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:44,460
So I loved it, too, basically, but I have some special workflow.

1349
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:51,440
So I'm using a software for mouse gestures, and I was not able to do my normal mouse gesture

1350
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,440
with Lib input.

1351
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:57,520
So in the end, I just removed that package, and I wanted to blacklist the Lib input.

1352
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,160
I was not able to.

1353
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:05,120
So I removed Lib input, and now I'm working on synaptics again, and I have to configure

1354
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,120
it with Xconfig.

1355
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,120
Oh, boy.

1356
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,800
God, now you feel like old Linux.

1357
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,800
So that's the one big change for X users.

1358
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,000
The other big change, yeah, you can use, okay, I will try that.

1359
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,760
So Blackout says you can use XF86 dash video dash Lib input on Arch to try it out.

1360
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:23,480
I might.

1361
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,380
The other big change is GDM.

1362
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:30,360
If you have an open, if you're using an open source graphics driver, GDM, the Graphical

1363
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:37,480
Login Manager, not GNOME itself, but GDM uses Wayland by default.

1364
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:41,600
I know that's going to cause some people problems, because it caused me problems.

1365
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,480
Essentially what would happen is I'd get grub, I'd hit enter, I would begin booting, I would

1366
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:49,800
get the Graphical Fedora boot screen, which is quite nice, where it fills the Fedora logo

1367
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:56,720
up as it boots, then it would hang with a completed boot logo for about 35 seconds,

1368
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:01,040
and then it drops down to a text console, and I get some sort of libc string errors.

1369
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,040
I can't even tell what it is.

1370
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:06,120
I get some string of errors, and the system never boots after that, or it never goes forward.

1371
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:10,120
It appears to hard lock even, because I can't control it, delete it, I can't ping it, anything

1372
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,760
like that.

1373
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:17,760
My fix, unfortunately, and I have this in the show notes.

1374
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,120
If you guys run into this, if you, after your installation, even though your live session

1375
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:27,340
worked fine, if after you reboot, after first boot, it doesn't go into the graphical session,

1376
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:34,680
you can go into slash Etsy slash grub, or I'm sorry, slash, not grub, slash Etsy slash

1377
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:38,600
GDM, because you're changing GDM not to use Wayland, so go to slash Etsy slash GDM slash

1378
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:47,280
custom.conf, edit custom.conf in Etsy GDM, and uncomment Wayland enable equal false.

1379
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,520
It's already in the file.

1380
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,920
You just uncomment the file and save it, and reboot the machine, and it won't try to use

1381
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:53,920
Wayland for GDM.

1382
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,700
Now, here's the tricky thing, because when it tries to launch Wayland, it hard locks

1383
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:58,980
the machine.

1384
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:03,540
Your options are to do no mode set at grub, you know, edit your grub boot line, and add

1385
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:10,480
no mode set, and then get in to your basic session, and then add that, remove that comment,

1386
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:16,200
or what I did, because I knew this was going to happen after my second installation, because

1387
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:20,920
I wanted to change my partition layout anyways, is before I rebooted the installer from the

1388
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:25,160
live environment, I just did a mount command, and I looked where my root file system was

1389
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:31,000
mounted at, and I just edited the custom.conf file right there from the live session, and

1390
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:36,440
all you have to do is just remove that comment line, or just leave the Wayland enable equal

1391
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:42,120
false, leave that, just remove the hashtag, the print, whatever, the number sign, so it's

1392
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:45,520
not a comment anymore, and then when you reboot, your system will boot just fine.

1393
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,240
You just have to disable Wayland, and that solved my problem, and now I'm able to use

1394
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:53,360
the open source driver, I have full 3D acceleration under GNOME, I'm getting all the fancy OpenGL

1395
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:56,840
effects, and my system boots, and it is running great.

1396
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:01,640
I've done updates since then, I've updated the base system, I've been installing applications,

1397
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,400
I can't believe how fast it runs.

1398
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,920
I can't believe how fast this thing runs.

1399
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,600
It's so fast.

1400
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:11,660
So my initial impression with Fedora 22 was a little rocky, because it never is a good

1401
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:15,360
impression after first boot to fail to get to X, that always kind of sucks, especially

1402
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:19,560
when it's really reliable hardware, and you just had a live environment that was working,

1403
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,880
so you know something's funky, but almost immediately to me it was probably like a Wayland thing.

1404
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:28,160
So there was a bug, now here's the only thing that might be tricky for you, is if you run

1405
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:33,520
into this, the way the Fedora project addresses this is they have a common problem section

1406
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:37,880
in their release notes, and they say it's a Macbook specific problem.

1407
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:43,600
So they'll say Macbook graphics aren't working, and even in the Wiki they say certain Macbook

1408
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:48,100
laptops with dual graphics card, the Fedora 22 live environment boots fine, but after

1409
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:52,080
installation there's just a black screen with no boot splash, followed by the GNOME login

1410
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,080
screen.

1411
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:56,560
This seems to be an issue with Wayland, the upcoming windowing system used by the GNOME

1412
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,740
login screen.

1413
01:13:57,740 --> 01:14:01,160
But it's actually not a Macbook issue, because I had it on the Bonobo.

1414
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:05,840
So I would bet it's probably a NuVu driver problem or specific model.

1415
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:15,000
So Ray asks, does the GNOME software tool show GNOME apps?

1416
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,480
And actually this is another problem with Fedora 22, and I have a link in the show notes

1417
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,360
about this.

1418
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:26,840
There is sort of a lack of apps in there right now, because there is an app description file

1419
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,540
that has to be updated in order to be displayed in GNOME software.

1420
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:34,960
That went mandatory starting with Fedora 22, and most of the projects that are in GNOME

1421
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,040
software have not submitted this app description file.

1422
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:42,320
So there is a lot of apps missing right now from GNOME software.

1423
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,640
Developers will be re-adding those description files, or the package maintainers will be

1424
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:50,360
re-adding those description files over the next few days.

1425
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,760
So you might be a little surprised by a lack of items in GNOME software.

1426
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:57,880
Now a little bit of silver lining here.

1427
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:02,100
Red Hat has hired, or is actually moving another one of their developers to work full time

1428
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:05,280
on the Nuvoo project, or work more on the Nuvoo project.

1429
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:09,840
So while I just ran into this issue with Fedora 22, maybe it's going to be fixed by Fedora

1430
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,980
23, and this has got to be good for Wayland.

1431
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:15,240
Red Hat's letting another one of their developers focus on improvements to the open source NVIDIA

1432
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,000
Linux graphics driver.

1433
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,980
Ben Skaggs is already a Nuvoo DRM driver maintainer, and David Arley, the overall DRM subsystem

1434
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:27,960
maintainer and contributor to Nuvoo, are already employees of Red Hat.

1435
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,400
So Hans will be joining.

1436
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:33,240
He's been mostly known for his Linux USB contributions in the past.

1437
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:37,120
One year ago he joined the Red Hat graphics team, where he's worked on various Xorg and

1438
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:41,520
Wayland things, and he was also one of the developers that worked on libinput that we

1439
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,360
just talked about.

1440
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,840
So now with the libinput work settling down, his next course of action is going to be working

1441
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,840
on Nuvoo.

1442
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,520
Right now it's not known specifically what he'll be focusing on, but he's still learning

1443
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:52,840
more about GPU driver programming.

1444
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:56,120
But it's really good to see Red Hat doing this, and he's already shared his new focus

1445
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:00,400
with the Nuvoo community via their development mailing list.

1446
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:04,200
So Red Hat's putting some more weight behind this.

1447
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,800
So perhaps by Fedora 23 this was going to be a problem of the past.

1448
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:11,000
It's just, yeah, like Blackout says, or Corky is saying, it's a transition.

1449
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Right Corky?

1450
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,840
It's a transition to Wayland that's going to be bumpy for a little while, don't you

1451
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:14,840
think?

1452
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:23,480
I do think that, and there's a lot of work to do, but it's very clear that the Fedora

1453
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,280
team are focused on this.

1454
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:30,600
This is one of their main features as a Linux distribution.

1455
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:37,640
It only really matters inside the Linux community, but it's a big difference.

1456
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:42,080
And I'm kind of, I'm looking forward to, I'm going to continue to run it for the rest of

1457
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,080
the week.

1458
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,680
I was running the beta versions.

1459
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,720
They also have the same Wayland problem.

1460
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:50,160
So I was hoping, in fact, I think I even sent Noah like a telegram the other night.

1461
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,960
I'm like, I'm hoping they fix this in the final ISO because this is the pain in the

1462
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:53,960
butt.

1463
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:58,080
But I'm not going to hold it against them because those things happen during these kinds

1464
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,360
of transitions and it's easy enough to fix and it is documented.

1465
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,440
Not necessarily documented correctly, but it's documented.

1466
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:06,960
So now that this stuff's out of the way, I feel like I've got a great setup.

1467
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,440
I've got a great performing system.

1468
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,440
It's on a great rig.

1469
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,840
It's going to be my main system for the rest of the week.

1470
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,360
And then on Sunday, we'll give you the full take and see what I've been able to make of

1471
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,360
it.

1472
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,240
Both Noah and I will be running it for the rest of the week.

1473
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:20,520
Noah, any thoughts so far before we close this topic up?

1474
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:21,520
Nope.

1475
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,520
Nope.

1476
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:27,600
I don't have, I'm sure, you know, it's hard to give any real feedback the day the, like

1477
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,360
I haven't even installed the actual ISO yet, so I don't want to pass any, any of the problems

1478
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,360
I'm having.

1479
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:34,080
I don't want to talk about them until I actually get the ISO.

1480
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:37,880
And then really you don't know all the problems you're going to have until you've actually

1481
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:38,880
used it for like a week.

1482
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,600
Are you going to run it on a laptop?

1483
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,600
Is that what you'll be running on?

1484
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:43,600
Yep.

1485
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,120
So my thought process on that is I have a workstation at my house, my main machine at

1486
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,560
my house, which does have Fedora, but I won't switch that over.

1487
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,880
I'm kind of in the same boat as Michael.

1488
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,120
I'll wait for a couple of days, maybe in a couple of weeks, until everything kind of

1489
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:57,120
fleshes out.

1490
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,080
And then once all that's smoothed over and I try everything on my laptop, then I'll move

1491
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,240
my actual workstation over.

1492
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,240
That makes sense.

1493
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:03,240
I like it.

1494
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,240
Yeah.

1495
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:08,240
I could see my, I really can see myself one day maybe becoming a primary Fedora user.

1496
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,240
Not yet.

1497
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:10,240
I don't think.

1498
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,240
Maybe.

1499
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,240
I'll let you know on Sunday.

1500
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,480
Maybe I'll use this for a couple of days and fall in love.

1501
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,580
There's a couple of tools out there I've already found that I really like.

1502
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:18,920
So it would just be a matter of getting some of my favorite applications I've had problems

1503
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:19,920
with in the past.

1504
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:20,920
I'm looking at you, Rupat.

1505
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:21,920
Telegram.

1506
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:22,920
I'm looking at you.

1507
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:23,920
So I'll let you guys know.

1508
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,240
I'd like to hear what you guys think.

1509
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:29,920
Go over to linuxactionshow.reddit.com and leave us your feedback for Fedora 22.

1510
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:34,360
And any tricks or tips that you would pass along to us to make it a better experience

1511
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:37,160
that maybe we could even pass along to the audience in Sunday's review.

1512
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,160
Love that too.

1513
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:40,840
linuxactionshow.reddit.com is a great place to make this show even better.

1514
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:41,840
You can also email us.

1515
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:46,060
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash contact and choose Linux Unplugged from the dropdown

1516
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:47,160
and send us in a note.

1517
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:48,160
We love that.

1518
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,160
That's really great.

1519
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,600
In fact, I'll try to get to a bunch of those next week because I don't think I've read

1520
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,600
any notes for a couple of weeks.

1521
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,600
I guess I'm a bit of a jerk.

1522
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,600
Sorry about that.

1523
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,600
So we'll get to those soon.

1524
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,960
Also, we'd love to have you join us live and don't forget we're doing it at 10 a.m. Pacific

1525
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,200
next week.

1526
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:04,100
Just next week we're doing a special early recording right after Tech Talk today.

1527
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:08,360
So show up if you'd like for Tech Talk today at 9 a.m. Pacific noon eastern.

1528
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,640
And then just stick around for Linux Unplugged right after that.

1529
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,840
Should be fun to do.

1530
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,400
It'll be a morning edition of the Linux Unplugged show and then I'll be hitting the road to

1531
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:16,400
go pick up some family.

1532
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,400
All right, everybody.

1533
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,680
Well, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1534
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:49,120
We'll see you right back here next week.

1535
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:24,160
There we go.

1536
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:26,800
It looks like Mr. Laravel has left the room, I think.

1537
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,440
That was nice of him to stop by though.

1538
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,440
That was nice.

1539
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,440
Good show, guys.

1540
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,440
Thank you very much.

1541
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:35,040
Now we need titles, jbtitles.com.

1542
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,040
Now we vote to the death.

1543
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:40,720
Has anybody tried out the plasma spin of Fedora?

1544
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:41,720
Anybody?

1545
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:42,720
Anybody?

1546
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:46,320
Is that running Plasma 5?

1547
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,320
I believe it is.

1548
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,320
Nice.

1549
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,340
Where's Dreava?

1550
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:52,340
Mm.

1551
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:55,120
Poor man, Dreava.

1552
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:59,080
I've been running nothing but Plasma 5 on Arch lately.

1553
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,080
How do you like it?

1554
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,960
Oh, it's so good.

1555
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:07,900
I've been such a Gnome fan for like ever since I started, you know, being part of Linux and

1556
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:08,900
then Plasma 5 came out.

1557
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:09,900
Really?

1558
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:10,900
I'm like, oh.

1559
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:11,900
Same here.

1560
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:12,900
No.

1561
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:13,900
No, no.

1562
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:14,900
I started trying KD5.

1563
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,960
Plasma 5 two weeks or so ago or something.

1564
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:17,960
Yeah.

1565
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:18,960
And you like it?

1566
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:26,400
Yeah, but the Dolphin file manager doesn't have Qt5 support, I think, so the theme looks screwed up.

1567
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:33,040
So I'm back to Gnome again, so I'm gonna wait for the Qt5 things to work out correctly.

1568
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:38,240
I tell you, Plasma 5 is really great. I mean, it is really, really great.

1569
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:41,440
I still think there's too many options for me, but it really comes down to my sound problems.

1570
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:46,640
I switch for weekends. Like, I go on vacations to Plasma 5, and I'm like,

1571
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:50,480
oh, it's so geeky and cool, and they've thought of so many neat things.

1572
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,800
And then I get burned out, and I go back to Gnome.

1573
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,080
Yeah, same here.

1574
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:59,120
And I'm really in love with the window manager, KWin, and the Wobbluin.

1575
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,480
Yes, yes, yes.

1576
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:13,840
Chris, you mentioned once that Gnome has the great advantage now with 3.16,

1577
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:18,480
that you almost do not realize that you're running a desktop environment,

1578
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,400
and that's the way to go for me.

1579
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:24,720
I like that too. Just totally out of the way, and except for when I need it, it is there.

1580
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:29,600
Like, when I need to search for files, or when I need to check my calendar, or manage a setting,

1581
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:34,000
it's there and gives me, I think, one of the best UIs to do that.

1582
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,120
But primarily, most of the time, I forget I'm even using a desktop environment, which I like.

1583
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:44,560
You see, on my dual-screen desktop here, I'm running E17 with Gnome integration,

1584
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:49,520
so for me, the switch is E17, you don't realize that you're using it. It's just there.

1585
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:55,440
So, the title should probably have something to do with our chat with Michael or with Fedora 22,

1586
01:22:55,440 --> 01:23:01,040
I would think. It's jbtitles.com. I like Fedora Explorer. I don't know, it's clever,

1587
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:06,960
but it doesn't really tell anybody what we talked about. You know? You know? You know?

1588
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:13,360
Wow, it says we talked about Fedora. Get it out of here!

1589
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,480
Uh, Fedora isn't yummy anymore, that's clever. Lock-in, slip and slide,

1590
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:23,760
I like that, but it doesn't really, again, cover what we talked about. Uh,

1591
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:38,960
uh, exploring Fedora, yeah, I guess. Chris, by the way, you're using Gnome 3.16, right?

1592
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:46,880
Yes, sir. In the bottom left corner, if you're not using top icons, is the drawer, like,

1593
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:52,480
vibrating if you put your mouse in the wrong position? Yes, it does vibrate sometimes,

1594
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:58,160
let's see. Okay, then it's not only me, because that's on three of my computers.

1595
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,720
It kind of shakes, too, sometimes. Yeah, it shakes a little bit, yeah.

1596
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:07,280
So, it's like the top left corner, but it vibrates and acts weirdly.

1597
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,800
Yes, I wonder if they did that on purpose, or...

1598
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,360
I don't think so, but if you turn on off animations, it stops doing that.

1599
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:19,200
Yeah, that makes sense. But I want my animations.

1600
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:24,480
Right. Uh, Chris, may I just ask, which age were you when you started using Linux?

1601
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:30,240
Well, I was still in high school, so I guess I was 18 or 19, 18, I guess, I suppose,

1602
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:35,040
is when I really first started, 17 or 18, I suppose. I'm 33 now.

1603
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:42,480
Yeah, I'm 19 now, so, and I've used Linux for the past two years.

1604
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:48,160
So, I'm somewhere in the 15 or 16-year range, but... Okay. Yeah.

1605
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,360
What was the first distribution?

1606
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,840
Well, I guess, technically, the first distribution I probably used was Red Hat

1607
01:24:55,840 --> 01:25:00,160
something, and then Debian around the same time. We had a Red Hat and Debian system,

1608
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:04,080
but they weren't my systems. Like, I used them, I destroyed them,

1609
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:08,720
I accidentally did rm-rf on the root while I was using the system, I did all of those things.

1610
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:09,440
That's clever.

1611
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:15,360
Yeah, but the first time I actually installed Mandrake or installed Linux for myself,

1612
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:19,120
like, this is going to be my machine, I'm putting this on my computer now, it was Mandrake.

1613
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:27,760
So, for me, I started with SUSE 6.1, so I still have the box here, and a huge book that came with

1614
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:33,600
it. And then I started switching, I started switching from the different RPM distributions,

1615
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:39,840
landed with Mandrake, then came a short Debian phase, and then Ubuntu started, and then I stayed

1616
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,040
with Ubuntu for a long time.

1617
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,680
Yeah, me too.

1618
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:48,000
I suddenly feel like a noob here. My first distribution was 10.04.

1619
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:56,240
My first was 12.04, but, well, I'm only 19 now, and I was 17 when I started.

1620
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,000
Well, not for the first time, but for the first nerdy time.

1621
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:07,200
I was going to say Fedora 15 was my first one, and that one's pretty old compared to now.

1622
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:15,120
Yeah, that's funny. I remember when Fedora Core became a thing. I remember when they

1623
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:15,760
dropped the core.

1624
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:23,680
Yeah, in fact, what saved me from my Mandrake hate was Red Hat. It was Red Hat, I think it

1625
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:29,120
was 7, and then they transitioned from Red Hat to RHEL and Fedora Core, and then they

1626
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:34,160
dropped the core. It was funny because that's kind of what got me started on Fedora was I used

1627
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:38,480
Fedora because it was the logical progression from Red Hat, and then I've stuck with every

1628
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:43,520
core since Fedora Core 1 all the way up and just upgraded my system. In fact, the original

1629
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:50,240
Fedora Core box I still have. I never nuked and paved it. I just kept upgrading it, and I think

1630
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:56,160
it is on Fedora Core 4 or 5, and it still works. I turned it on in a while, but that's a testament

1631
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:57,920
to live. I've never actually had to do anything with it.

1632
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:03,120
Yeah. Hey, changing topics for a second, just thinking about the Mandrake story,

1633
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,880
the Mandrake company story, I think the Linux Action Show subreddit broke that story.

1634
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:12,160
I'm not positive because the guy that submitted it linked, well, obviously we didn't break it

1635
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:19,200
because that French website did, but I think we were the first US website to have it, and then

1636
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:25,200
LWN and Ferronix picked it up. Nobody linked to us, though.

1637
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:30,480
Well, we would. The subreddit post was 20 minutes before the Ferronix post.

1638
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:35,120
And you know, I've also been noticing, and it's fine, I guess. I mean, it's a subreddit,

1639
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:39,200
it's a public subreddit, so what can I say? It's fine. But I've also noticed several Softpedia

1640
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:44,400
stories based on stories out of the subreddit. It seems to be a resource for a lot of people,

1641
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:48,480
which I guess in a way is pretty awesome. I mean, one of the soapboxes we're on all the

1642
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:52,560
time is we need to improve the Linux press coverage, and if our subreddit's helping do that,

1643
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:56,720
it wasn't exactly what I had in mind, but I mean, shit, at least it's something.

1644
01:27:56,720 --> 01:28:00,000
And the other thing is, too, is it would be nice if JB got some credit for it.

1645
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,640
Yeah, that would be...

1646
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:06,080
It's kind of common decency, even if it's not copyrighted.

1647
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,880
Just give us a source link or something would be great.

1648
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,760
Right. Or even if all they said was,

1649
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,440
we pulled this from the JB subreddit and we pulled it,

1650
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,360
Jupiter Broadcasting reported today, something.

1651
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:16,880
That would be nice.

1652
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,600
I guess the way to capitalize... Yeah, see, the problem is they can always get it from

1653
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,200
our subreddit. Even if we had our own news, even if we published that stuff on the site.

1654
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:28,000
But all right, so right now, Fedora Explorer is still our top title. I'm just not digging that.

1655
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,080
Fedora isn't yummy anymore coming in number two.

1656
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,440
Fed up Benchet?

1657
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:31,920
What's that?

1658
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,360
Fed up Benchet.

1659
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:37,840
Yeah, that's okay, too.

1660
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:38,560
Like, are you fed up?

1661
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:43,440
Fed up, yeah. Fed up Benchet, yeah. It's not bad. None of these are really awesome.

1662
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:47,200
How about Fedora Milady?

1663
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:50,560
What, dude? What's that got to do with anything?

1664
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,560
Madriva Falls and Fedora Rises.

1665
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:53,920
Or Fedora Malinx.

1666
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,880
Madriva Falls and Fedora Rises?

1667
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:57,520
I got it.

1668
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:58,240
Fedora Hipster.

1669
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,280
Fedorable Benchmarks.

1670
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,760
Fedorable Benchmarks.

1671
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,520
But then it sounds like you're benchmarking Fedora, though.

1672
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,400
Madriva Falls, Fedora Rises, that's not bad.

1673
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:14,560
He does use Fedora, so technically that's sort of relevant.

1674
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,600
Would it be too much advertisement using the name Fornix in it?

1675
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:19,840
I don't know.

1676
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:23,200
I think it would probably hurt the emphasis.

1677
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:26,000
Fedora gets benched, Fedora now and it's future.

1678
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:28,880
I guess we'll go with Fedora Rises, Madriva.

1679
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:29,920
What was it? What was it? What was it?

1680
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:30,880
Fedora Rises.

1681
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,240
As Madriva Falls, Fedora Rises.

1682
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:36,640
Fedora Rises, Madriva, and Madriva Falls.

1683
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,760
Whichever one sounds more catchy to me.

1684
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:42,560
It's kind of long.

1685
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,200
Fedora Rises and Madriva Falls.

1686
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:48,480
Should it be Fedora Rises, Common, Madriva Falls?

1687
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,240
Yeah, it doesn't really fall.

1688
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:54,240
I mean, they were about to die and they got revived and they're still dead.

1689
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:55,680
So it's kind of bad for them.

1690
01:29:55,680 --> 01:30:01,120
How about something like Madriva Passes Away and Fedora, Fedora's New Baby.

1691
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:03,520
I don't even think there's a place for Madriva in the title to be honest.

1692
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:04,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1693
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:05,920
I think you're probably right.

1694
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,080
I think that's probably right.

1695
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:08,880
Let's see.

1696
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:09,440
Fedora.

1697
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,600
I don't even know if I necessarily have to go with the title.

1698
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,560
I don't even know if I necessarily need Fedora in the title since Sunday's Linux Action Show

1699
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:15,360
is going to be about Fedora.

1700
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:22,640
I mean, you're fed up with seeing Linux regressions.

1701
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,640
You're fed up because Fedora.

1702
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,320
Because the program Fedora.

1703
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,280
And you're benchmarking it.

1704
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,120
Okay, you make it a good pitch.

1705
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:29,680
I'll give you that.

1706
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:34,320
You should probably use Fedora anyway just because it was released today anyway.

1707
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:34,800
Yeah, that's true.

1708
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,120
Madriva is the big news.

1709
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:37,620
You think?

1710
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:39,360
I'm not so sure it is.

1711
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,680
In fact, I think the sad thing is that it's not big news.

1712
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:45,360
Well, I think that it makes everybody start thinking back.

1713
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,640
It's nostalgic.

1714
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:52,160
Yeah, but to me, all it says is it's just verifying what I already thought years ago.

1715
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,280
So you've had a guest.

1716
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,120
Yeah, we did have a guest.

1717
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,240
We named it after the guest.

1718
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:57,360
Yeah, the votes.

1719
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:58,000
Yeah, that's true.

1720
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:58,880
I do agree with that.

1721
01:30:58,880 --> 01:30:59,760
It would be a good way to go.

1722
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,560
Is Michael fed up with Bench?

1723
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:06,640
The regression killer, regression hater, hating regressions.

1724
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:10,640
The quest to kill, the quest to quell regressions.

1725
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,200
What about that?

1726
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,040
The quest to quell regressions.

1727
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:16,400
The quest to quell regressions.

1728
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:19,440
The quest to quell regressions.

1729
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,400
The quest to quell regressions.

1730
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,760
It seems more just Linux books.

1731
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,480
It sounds like the Linux benchmarking.com.

1732
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:26,720
Actually, not terrible.

1733
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,560
What about putting Linux performance on the record?

1734
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:29,280
Is that too long?

1735
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,600
How about just benchmarking Linux?

1736
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,400
Actually, you already have Linux on the...

1737
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,400
Linux Unplugged on the record.

1738
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:40,080
I think you already have Linux Unplugged based on benchmarks.

1739
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,920
It's on the record because it's the show.

1740
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:46,880
And it's still on the record because we're really recording the benchmarks and all about it.

1741
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,000
Benchmarking TNG.

1742
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,080
Come on, come on.

1743
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,040
There's got to be something in here.

1744
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:53,680
The quest to quell...

1745
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:55,200
Fedora chip to Madriva.

1746
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,400
I'm not sure what that is.

1747
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,120
The quest to quell... Fedora chip to Madriva.

1748
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,120
I actually kind of like the benchmarking Linux one.

1749
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,120
Doesn't that sound super boring though?

1750
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:04,880
Well, here's the thing.

1751
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:06,480
The problem with the quest to quell...

1752
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:09,520
That's really catchy, but it's like the least descriptive thing ever.

1753
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:10,000
Yeah, I know.

1754
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,120
What about Madriva benched?

1755
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,280
Well, it's not bad.

1756
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,680
How about Madriva sits the bench?

1757
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:21,360
Tip your Fedora to Madriva.

1758
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:28,240
Or Madriva bench no more.

1759
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,520
Microsoft buys Madriva.

1760
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:30,640
That one keeps jumping out at me.

1761
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:32,080
That would get some clicks.

1762
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:36,400
All right.

1763
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,120
All right.

1764
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,080
Benchmarking benchmark.

1765
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,200
You should just name it clickbait.

1766
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:41,040
That'd be good.

1767
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,280
Fedora next gets benched.

1768
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:44,640
Michael, the regression terminator.

1769
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:45,520
See, that's funny to me.

1770
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:46,080
That's funny.

1771
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,000
Let's see.

1772
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,880
America's next top...

1773
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,960
But then everyone's going to be Michael, what, Michael from Coder Radio?

1774
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:53,440
What?

1775
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:53,920
Yeah, right.

1776
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:54,400
Yeah, that's true.

1777
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:58,480
How about you wouldn't believe what Michael does in his basement?

1778
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:00,720
I like that, yeah.

1779
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:02,720
Michael's basement.

1780
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:05,200
Yeah, that's good.

1781
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,880
We should put something about that basement in there.

1782
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:09,840
I guess we could do...

1783
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:10,960
Basement benchmarking.

1784
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,640
I mean, yeah, we could do benchmarking Linux.

1785
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:15,840
That is like our basement benchmarking.

1786
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:20,400
Yeah, it kind of downplays what he's doing a little bit though.

1787
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,440
Linux gets benched.

1788
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,200
Benchmarking Linux only has two votes.

1789
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:28,800
Basement benchmark.

1790
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,080
Linux coming off the bench.

1791
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,680
Actually, no, I just typed it America.

1792
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,400
Step into larable's basement.

1793
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:41,360
Yeah, I don't know.

1794
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,080
I think we're going to have to go with benchmarking Linux as lame as that is.

1795
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:45,280
God, that seems lame.

1796
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,640
You know, that feels like a committee compromise.

1797
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:49,520
If we were doing benchmark Linux, I would want to do benchmarks as well

1798
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,920
instead of just reporting on one site doing benchmarks.

1799
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,400
I would do a lot more involvement in that title.

1800
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,600
So say again, so what now?

1801
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:06,080
If we were doing benchmarking as in the whole show's topic,

1802
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:12,080
I would want to also do my own benchmarks and report some fun findings back to the show.

1803
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:15,520
Yeah, yeah, it does seem like a title for a show where we're actually doing benchmarks, right?

1804
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,680
I used to do file system benchmarks all the time.

1805
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:24,640
That's why I landed on XFS back in like 2004 anyway.

1806
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:27,600
Is the question in the title something doable?

1807
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,480
Because if it is, you can ask, are you fed up?

1808
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,400
Regression terminator.

1809
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,480
Let's see, the quest.

1810
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:40,400
No, I got nothing with that.

1811
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,040
Let's see.

1812
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,840
There's got to be something in the fact that he benchmarks because he hates regressions.

1813
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:44,800
There's got to be a title there.

1814
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:48,560
Regressing on the bench.

1815
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,040
Which is terrible.

1816
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,720
Yeah, I think we're gonna have to go benchmarking Linux as awful as it is.

1817
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:02,560
Even though it kind of, oh yeah.

1818
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:05,360
And it is true because it is actually benchmarking the Linux kernel.

1819
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,200
It literally is benchmarking Linux.

1820
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:11,120
Oh, oh, geez, get it out of here.

1821
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:24,240
Oh, we can use one sentence that Michael pulled off, which is Linux graphics drivers are in

1822
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:25,520
pair with Windows.

1823
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,360
So Linux pairs Windows.

1824
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:30,160
11 years.

1825
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:31,040
Okay.

1826
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,320
I do actually kind of agree.

1827
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:33,040
Actually, you know what?

1828
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:33,760
Micro 89.

1829
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:34,560
I do agree.

1830
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,160
Actually, Micro 89 is right.

1831
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:37,120
He's totally right.

1832
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:42,880
11 years of Linux benchmarking is sort of a call out to Ferronics and Michael, but also

1833
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:43,760
still about benchmarking.

1834
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:47,200
It doesn't make it sound like it's the episode itself is about benchmarking.

1835
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:50,320
But has he always been benchmarking?

1836
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,560
Close enough.

1837
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,000
Maybe it's just news science.

1838
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,040
Close enough.

1839
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,680
I'm going to go with 11 years of Linux benchmarking.

1840
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,160
I think it's actually pretty good.

1841
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:03,280
That's actually, if you think about it, it is once you realize it's Liar Bell, it's,

1842
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:04,800
I don't know, it's a good shout out to him.

1843
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:08,160
You could do just a decade, a decade of Linux benchmarks.

1844
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:09,280
Something like that.

1845
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:10,480
No, you can do something.

1846
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:11,680
Well, let's say even longer.

1847
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:12,880
Yeah, 11 is shorter.

1848
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:13,600
I know you're right.

1849
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,080
It reads better, but yeah.

1850
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,040
All right.

1851
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:17,600
Wow.

1852
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,000
Wow.

1853
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,240
Just when I was about to flush it too, right at the last moment, you know what that means?

1854
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:23,520
We get a hello, everybody, from Obama.

1855
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,320
Hello, everybody.

1856
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:35,200
Hey, look at us.
