1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,860
Hey Eric, I was it you that submitted the imp to the to the subreddit you guys

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,240
Did you see this we have we have another crowdsourced Linux computer. I'm a sucker for these

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,140
I love like you get the promo video

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,380
It's like you get the you get the will it make its funding like it's not gambling

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,040
But there's a there's an element of it

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,800
It's it's so it's a lot of fun and it's interesting to sell these independent hardware guys, too

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,000
they've been doing a lot of

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,520
social outreach shall we say if you follow the

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,960
The Twitter feed just go and have a look at the tweets and mentions of their marketing person

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,160
It's pinging basically everyone in the free software community asking them. Hey, what do you think of our thing?

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,680
Can you reshare it please? So I said to them? Well, it's not open source

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,600
It says open source, but it isn't because there's binary blobs in there and they were like, yeah

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,960
Yeah, that's binary, but everything else is open source

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,600
I said, yeah, but at the top it says fully open source and it isn't so let's so we should talk about that

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,700
Cuz if everything works out the the Librem 15 creator the laptop that I crowdfunded

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,320
A couple of weeks ago in the last news segment is gonna join us today

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,320
And I I think this is a question we need to ask

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,900
How do you promote yourself as like do no evil all open but yet still manage to ship something that is competitive, right?

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:17,340
Which event which is my nice way of saying, you know an actual GPU that has a binary blob driver and closed source drivers

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,500
So I think that's a really good question. I want to play this video wimpy

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,440
I'm gonna toss the link to that guide in the show notes for people that are listening after the fact

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,440
But let's let's play this a little bit

23
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,240
And then we'll talk about it because I love I love the fact that all these come with videos

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,720
That's like the best part for me. Oh, we got some music

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
Technology has virtually exploded

26
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,000
Surprisingly only one thing has stayed the same the desktop

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Imp is here to change that

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,760
Imp resolves your entire home computing needs in one ready-to-use unit that fits in the palm of your hand

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,700
Just plug it in and see what it can do for you

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:03,420
Imp is a full-blown desktop computer that suits all of your everyday home use needs whether it's browsing the web

31
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:10,100
Checking your email being social or even if it had this holographic interface that would be a slam dunk

32
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:16,140
So it's looking I'm trying to figure out what the desktop environment is do you guys know

33
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,540
Yeah, so it's a cinnamon theme perhaps

34
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:35,100
Because I don't recognize look of it, but I've seen or heard about this somewhere so touch my head work

35
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:41,940
I think it's interesting. There's talking about media streaming capabilities, too. It can even back up all your phone's media

36
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:53,340
So it streams to yours it streams to your television and it backs up your phones and it uses the cinnamon desktop and

37
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,940
It's called imp MP. So oh

38
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,060
This is this is that we got more video

39
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,620
But what do you guys think was it implying that there was some sort of NFC when you set your phone next to it?

40
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,700
It's gonna start sinking. No, yeah, they showed in the video. They showed him hooking up a USB cable. I got you

41
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,980
Yeah, so it's got it's raised

42
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:19,660
33,000 USD it's trying to get to 100,000 33% funded 35 hours left only 35 hours at 33%

43
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,620
That's stretch goal. Yeah, that's that's tight. I

44
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,380
guess

45
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:33,440
See what you have to be buying here is their custom software solution that sits on top of this because otherwise you'd probably just buy

46
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,580
A knock although the prices are cheaper than a knock. Yeah, but it's it's it's way lower spec than a knock. It's an odroid

47
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah exactly and that's one thing

48
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,420
q5 sis pointing out

49
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,620
Odroids are not legal in the u.s. Because the FCC will not recognize them. What?

50
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,620
Yeah, no, I think there's devices here that have a droid processors, isn't it?

51
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:01,780
Well, it took q5 sis forever to get his odroid machines into the like a licensing issue. It'd be like it'd be like oh

52
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,420
Well, that's because they are FCC certified. I'll tell you I had a problem

53
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,900
I've ordered seven or eight odroid products and I've never had a problem with any of them

54
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:15,240
So yeah, hmm. I wonder if it depends on the model. So this is using the odroid youth three

55
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,420
It looks like I'm not they're not gonna hit their target. So no, I don't think so. Probably not

56
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,180
Is this the wrong approach though, I mean maybe the better

57
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,820
I mean is it is it possible to do is it is the crowdfunding required because you have to reach scale?

58
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,060
Because if I could just buy one of these, I mean, maybe they just sell them one-off

59
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,340
I don't I guess I guess that never really works. I suppose. Well, the problem is that the

60
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,140
Crowdfunding is a way to go from zero to hero in a very short period of time

61
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,500
What they don't want to do is they don't want to put in the work that every other company that exists right now has gone

62
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,900
Through which is sell a small number of one item

63
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,780
Then so the slightly larger number of your next revision of that item then the next and then the next go through iterations

64
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,700
They want to go from nothing to big bang and sell one device

65
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,980
However, here's the here's the devil's advocate to that. So in their specs, right?

66
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,780
They're going up against the Chrome box

67
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:16,400
Now the Chrome box is a pretty hard competitor because the hardware is literally being subsidized by Google and Intel, right?

68
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,780
On the x86 versions of Chrome boxes

69
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,420
so if you're an independent manufacturer and you're going up against these industry Titans that have can they can

70
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:30,380
Substitize the hardware cost there by lowering the cost of the Chromebook or the Chrome box then maybe your only way to be competitive

71
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,700
Is to have some scale so that way you can buy in at lower prices and charge lower rates, right?

72
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,220
And they'll make it scale crowdfunding when you're not their only way of having a USB

73
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:45,020
They've got other USP's that the Chrome box doesn't have like all this home syncing stuff that that I haven't seen on

74
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,180
Any computer out of the box? So that's a USB

75
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,420
So you're saying that that that service value add would justify a higher price

76
00:05:53,420 --> 00:06:00,260
I think not justify a higher price, but justify it existing in a normal retail channel and not having to go the yeah

77
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,780
crowdfunding

78
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:09,020
Built-in apps and services. They've got the Microsoft Office suite listed in one drive

79
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,040
So I assume that they're they're linking to office 365. Yeah, I think so

80
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:20,960
This particular doesn't this this is on the go-go and it doesn't matter if they reach it or not. They're keeping them from hunting regardless

81
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:28,520
That's right. Yeah, they get they get a larger cut taken from IndieCo go there. Right, right, right. No, it's a fixed funding

82
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Funding that you get it all isn't it?

83
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,520
Funding campaign. Yeah, it is if you have if you hover it it says that if you hover the question mark next to it

84
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,520
It says they're still gonna keep it

85
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:49,360
Oh, yeah fixed this campaign will receive all funds raised even if it does not reach its goal. So they're already gonna make 33,000

86
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,980
Maybe they use that as investment seating to go out and make a product that does go to retail. I don't know

87
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:07,100
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that has a totally legitimate reason for wearing pajamas all day

88
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,540
My name is Chris and my name is Matt

89
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,100
And you wouldn't believe the day I've had today

90
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,060
So, I mean we got a great show I mean not to overshadow episode 69

91
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,740
It's gonna be great Todd from purism is joining us to talk about the ultimate free Linux laptop

92
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:28,820
And then there is a major Docker competitor that has been announced by the core OS project and I'm super excited about it

93
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,720
It's really geeky, but I'm really excited. We're gonna talk about that. Plus we got feedback but Matt

94
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,260
Matt

95
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:41,020
This is Matt. This is the thing Matt. All right. I woke up this morning to the sound of somebody

96
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,580
Pouring water a glass of water maybe like a jar of water on the floor upstairs

97
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,440
Oh, no, and it hears how it goes my wife reaches over sick. Hey, wake up. Hey, wake up

98
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,980
Do you hear that and my wife's first conclusion is somebody is broken into the house and the whole purpose of breaking into our house

99
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:06,380
There's a poor glass of water on the floor, right and I immediately discredit that theory. I'm like, no, that's not so I go out there

100
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,660
My three-year-old daughter didn't quite make it to the bathroom. Oh, no

101
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,780
Yeah, so that that was my morning is I had to clean a little bit of a mess right there good

102
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,220
Well, actually, I just I you know what I did. I'm gonna be honest

103
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,900
I just put a towel on but you know, somebody had to clean up head mess

104
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,820
I don't know who and I get then and then I leave Matt

105
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,500
I drive to the studio in you know, it's arctic 21 degrees Fahrenheit out here

106
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:33,980
Oh, yeah, and I get out of the truck in in a very and the jb1 studios is a fairly public street

107
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,060
It's not there's not much privacy to be had there, right?

108
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:41,380
I step out of the truck and my favorite pair of jeans Matt not like a pair of jeans

109
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:47,020
I like to wear but my a pair of jeans that I've worn for years. Love it. Take care of them

110
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,620
I barely wash them, you know all of the things you do with your favorite pair of jeans

111
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:56,660
I step out of the truck and it's they're old. So it snags the like the step on my truck

112
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:02,140
Oh, no, okay rips the jeans all the way up to my butt cheek all the way up to my butt cheek Matt

113
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,820
It rips them all the way up

114
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,860
I'm standing out there with half of my ass hanging out in the road in

115
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:14,260
21 degree weather and I'm thinking to myself. I haven't even made it into the studio yet. What could possibly go wrong?

116
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,460
However, this is this is where you cue Swedish volleyball team driving by the bus

117
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,100
As they go by you know, I'll have to you know

118
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,400
I kind of a story along those lines off to share another show one day

119
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:29,040
I got I'll have to have a few drinks before I share that story because it's it's it's scarring but so I

120
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:36,000
Realized though. This was an opportunity to make some lemonade and you know, I'm always looking for life's lemonade opportunities

121
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,300
Oh, yeah, because I had as every good podcaster does let's be frank

122
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,260
I had a backup pair of pants in the studio a pajama

123
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,220
You know, I had pajama pants in the studio

124
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:52,100
So I've legitimately had a had a solid excuse to wear pajama pants all day long today

125
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,780
And at first I was kind of upset about it because my favorite pair of jeans then I realized

126
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,420
Pajama pants no guilt that is almost worth it. Plus. I think the wife might be able to fix the pants

127
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,940
So all in all that's cool. Yeah, it's not so bad

128
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:10,180
Well, we do have a lot to get to I probably shouldn't mess around too much because tons of stuff to cover

129
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:15,100
So I'll bring in our mumble room and they can help us comment away on things as they come up

130
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:24,700
But time-appropriate greetings mumble room great to have you here. Hello. Happy Tuesday. Oh, yeah, you're right about that

131
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,480
And welcome back colonel Linux on the cheap rig. Good to have you here, sir

132
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:34,300
How's the cheap rig sounding today? I I think it sounds pretty good. Wow. I think it sounds better than I do

133
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:42,340
All right, it's official we're doing a segment on on colonel Linux is cheap podcasting Linux rig setup

134
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,260
We've got to do it before the end of the year colonel Linux. So you got to figure it out

135
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,220
Maybe I'll game people can make it their end-of-year purchase

136
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,420
All right, so we got to get into some follow-up as per tradition on the Linux unplugged show

137
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,180
We like to keep the continuity

138
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,540
so those of you who listen to every episode you get rewarded by some continuity for every show and those of you who don't get

139
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,180
A chance to listen you kind of hear some fragments of stuff

140
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,520
We've covered so you get an idea of maybe it's worth jumping back into the back catalog. So Chris not me

141
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:14,400
Writes in with our first emailing says hey Chris Matt and the mumble room I just finished listening to Linux action show and unplugged episodes

142
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:21,960
Around Linux in the Penn Manor schools and I got to say wow. I am and I I am in IT for a district school system in

143
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,680
WV and that's I think if I'm right

144
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,360
That's the Volkswagen bug and I have been trying to introduce links for 15 years in my district. It's been very hard

145
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,240
We have 22 sites 11,000 students 4,000 staff and only seven in the IT staff

146
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,360
I was envious of Penn Manor with their nine. Anyways

147
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,400
Last year we introduced some Chromebooks and I thought maybe Linux is finally gonna be a possibility

148
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:54,160
Until this school year the State Department made a deal with Microsoft every employee and student in our state gets unlimited storage on one drive

149
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,440
Yes unlimited it started at one terabyte

150
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,840
But it's now actually become unlimited for them every employee and student also gets five installs of office 2013

151
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,560
Oh, there's a winner that they can download and manage from office 365 and our state has

152
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,000
unlimited

153
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,760
licenses on Windows 7 and 8 installs

154
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,880
The price of office and Windows is now gone

155
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:20,840
We only pay for server licenses and cows client access licenses. So Microsoft is fighting back

156
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,400
I know this cannot be I know this cannot be free and the state has to be paying something to Microsoft

157
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,240
But districts never see that money and it doesn't even cut into the district budget this

158
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,160
I think cut into our plans for more Chromebooks this year, but I have now seen Microsoft's I've now

159
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,160
I have now seen more Microsoft services come through the shop

160
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,960
Just thought you might want to know that Microsoft is fighting back and doesn't want to die

161
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,840
Boy, it sounds like they're not just fighting back, but it sounds like they it sounds like they're going long

162
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,840
I think they realize that you know

163
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:58,000
There's no sense in trying to drill down on the school districts go along get people brainwashed into using the product and you'll get them

164
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,800
Later, you know, they're gonna buy this and it sounds they are trying to go hardware

165
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,080
It sounds like a little bit like maybe get the state to bear the cost. Yeah, and you know, I got a wonder though

166
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,280
Is

167
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,720
This a sign that Windows 10 is gonna be free. Oh

168
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,840
It will be I I would be sure it'd be stupid at this point if they don't it's the only thing it's cuz it works

169
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,760
Right. It's hard to argue with free if it's crap. Yeah, and you can see here. They're responding to Chromebooks

170
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,760
And devices like it

171
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,240
by

172
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,960
Selectively making Windows free as they can, you know not making a big deal about it not making it public

173
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,300
But when it comes down to it, they're making it free and you got to think they're doing that

174
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:41,160
Specifically because they know that the cost of the operating system is like look Apple gives it away now, right?

175
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,940
You know, it's a commercial OS. They're giving it away. Linux is free Chrome OS is quote-unquote free Android is free

176
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,840
So what's Microsoft gonna do? They're gonna have to do this

177
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,000
That's right, and it's honestly I I'm kind of surprised it took him this long

178
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
Well, believe it or not there have been

179
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Miscellaneous leaks from multiple

180
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:06,080
Executives at Microsoft that have said that Windows 10 will be free. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not surprised

181
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,480
I've read a lot of articles that basically there was a

182
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,400
Somebody like what the executives in Indonesia did say it would be free free as in cost we should point out. Yes

183
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:25,200
Free as in cost. Yeah. Yeah, but surely that will be some special version of Windows that's free. Oh no, they're talking free upgrades from 8 and 7

184
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,360
Yeah, I don't think in their cash cow is enterprise, isn't it?

185
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,000
With all of the extra enterprise services and surely they can continue to charge for that. To Wimpy's point, it's gonna got no business

186
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,480
Yeah, it's gonna be like a not necessary probably not as limited as a starter edition

187
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,600
But I there must I mean there must be some restrictions in order to get enterprise to pay. I

188
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,120
I don't know. Were you gonna say something rotten?

189
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,240
I was gonna say that Windows 10 home sounds like it'd be free

190
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,640
But they're like the like the pro version would be the expense

191
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,840
Yeah, I could totally see that and Windows and probably for most consumers. It'd be fine. I

192
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,200
Don't like it

193
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,920
They rip us off and then they make it free

194
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,840
They rip off the ideas of comp is and and and desktop management and and all this crap

195
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,960
And then they also rip off the whole pricing structure. It's damn it. I just don't like it at all

196
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,960
Oh, but are there Windows wobbly?

197
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,940
You can probably edit the registry to make it happen man

198
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,300
Right exactly good old start menu say stop

199
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,240
Hey, why don't we do one more bit of follow-up

200
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:36,320
So a big thank you to Gabriel 3 in the subreddit who's been a very active poster in there recently with some really great content

201
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Especially for those of you trying out open SUSE

202
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:45,840
So Gabriel mentions that we covered the sync thing GTK front-end on the Linux action show this Sunday and since then there's actually been

203
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,480
some updates and he points us to the web update article web updates really been doing a great job of following the sink thing project and

204
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:57,520
They do a great job of breaking some of this out for those of you who maybe aren't familiar with this sink thing and you

205
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,280
might have heard of pulse there

206
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:06,200
Now two different sink solutions that are similar to Dropbox or bit torrent sink or a sparkle share. It's totally open

207
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,400
It has a really interesting trust model, which works really well if you're just thinking

208
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,240
From you know in between some of your machines and now there's a GTK front-end

209
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,440
It's under heavy development, and there's in a couple of weeks

210
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,400
There's been a several updates and now has an auto updater for the by for the binary of the daemon

211
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,320
Which is really cool?

212
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,160
It's not enabled by default on Linux

213
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,280
But web update will tell you how to turn it on a link to that in the show notes and now as a first time

214
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,920
Run wizard to help get you all set up

215
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,440
And what directories you want to point at speed throttling options are now exposed through the notification icon menu

216
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
And I thought this was kind of neat

217
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,740
It's doing it's doing and I talked about this on the next action show

218
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:46,360
but it's actually using the file system io notify to know when files have been changed and then

219
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,180
Making sure they get synced up which is just nice and slick and integrated

220
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,960
So I'm the reason why I'm talking more about sink thing these days is I think people are getting more and more upset with bit

221
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,080
Torrent sink, and I just want to make sure people are aware of a free alternative in every sense of that term free

222
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,120
That's out there, and now it's nice to see it getting a GTK front-end and web update is

223
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,240
Linking you right here to the PPA if you're on an Ubuntu install, and it's also available in a you are

224
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:17,000
Looking good. I don't know if I'm gonna switch yet, but it's looking good. I'm I'm I don't know why I'm so gun-shy about it

225
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,840
I'm becoming an old man young Chris young Chris would just jump whole hog and you know part of it is

226
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,840
I don't know if you guys saw this but

227
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:30,400
a spider oak had a one terabyte deal for cyber Monday and

228
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,920
And I grabbed that because it was a great one terabyte storage deal for spider oak

229
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,480
Some kind of I don't know probably have a spider oak is the clients not it's not my favorite

230
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,960
yes, true sink thing is called sink thing GTK and

231
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:50,980
You just need Python and GTK on your system, and you can start playing with it if you haven't switched anything yet

232
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,040
Check out sink thing. I think it's the one to get behind for a little while

233
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,560
At least for most of us Linux users unless you need to distribute publicly then you might want to look at bit torrent sink

234
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,040
Hey, I'll tell you about something else. You might want to look at for a little bit

235
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,020
That's our first sponsor this week, and that's Linux Academy

236
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:11,520
It's Linux courses created by people that truly understand you and Linux because they're Linux users themselves

237
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,780
And I think we all know the difference that can make I'm I'm gonna recommend you do something

238
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,820
Just take a minute and go over to Linux Academy right now in fact if you go to Linux Academy

239
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,620
Check out their tour. They have a tour of all of their great features, but go to linuxacademy.com

240
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:34,260
Slash unplug start there linuxacademy.com slash unplugged it's gonna get you a 33% discount take a look at some of their training courses

241
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:39,460
They've got everything and I've been hearing from some of you who've been signing up and trying out different things stuff

242
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,100
I never even think to mention they have I think a good one and

243
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:50,180
If I ever if I ever get around to actually hosting all of my config files on my own git lab server

244
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:56,460
This course that they have on git basics and all of the introduction to git installing and configuring git

245
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,660
Working with github or git lab

246
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,100
Working with Atlassian or bitbucket just so I have I like this just so I have an idea of

247
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,900
What the alternatives would be like like that is super valuable for me?

248
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,340
And it's so nice to know that Linux Academy's just got this content available

249
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,260
It's part of my subscription and I get access to it

250
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,420
So when I get around to finally getting like my home director whatever

251
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:21,260
A great sync solution I get or maybe it's our publishing system for Jupiter broadcasting. They stick up on a git lab server

252
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:27,780
I'm gonna want to make sure I take this course and it's like that for everything Linux Academy has seven plus Linux distributions

253
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:33,460
You get to pick from and then they automatically adjust the courseware. So that way it reflects the distribution you've chosen

254
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,460
They have on-demand training you go in there and say I need a learning plan for this amount of

255
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,340
Availability and it will custom build that training for you

256
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,540
It'll give you the timeline the estimates if you're at work and you know down the road boy

257
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,020
2015 is finally the year we're gonna get off our butt and get puppet implemented. We're gonna finally do this, right?

258
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:58,180
Well, why not use that this time now to go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and take their puppet training

259
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,460
It's a great opportunity to sort of get in there do their scenario based training use their automatically generated VMs that go along with

260
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,040
The courseware you get public access to those. It's so neat

261
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,780
You get to keep track of your progress as you go along to give you a good visualization and display

262
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,700
So you get a really good sense of where you're at

263
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:21,500
You can get exactly how much time it's gonna take if you need to expand out to AWS for some scaling or something

264
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,620
You might want to load on there. You can go take all of the courseware available on AWS

265
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:30,780
They have a bunch of courseware on OpenStack if you find yourself in that gray area of DevOps that I like to tease people about

266
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,300
But it's a real thing, you know

267
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,980
It's something you find you kind of sometimes you go into a job this DevOps and sometimes you realize your job is DevOps

268
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,980
It can go both ways and Linux Academy has you covered. It's so great. They also have team accounts for groups

269
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,900
So if you're part of a team or a small business or even a large business and you want to all work together

270
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:54,620
They've got that they have a community support infrastructure to give you that motivation you need and they're always adding new labs two to

271
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,660
Three a week at this rate. It's really awesome

272
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:02,540
And I think the scenario based training is not only unique to Linux Academy because you'll work with all of these technologies. Let's

273
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,160
Take anything for example

274
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,580
You know, maybe it's an implementation of nginx. Maybe it's an AWS implementation

275
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,780
But the great thing is with these scenario based trainings

276
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,580
You'll actually use the technology you're going to be supporting the technology

277
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:21,620
You're going to be responsible for the technology. You're going to be on the line for what Linux Academy. You'll actually do it

278
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,100
You'll implement it

279
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:28,500
That's the kind of confidence that you can't just go out and get you have to use somebody who you have to go with

280
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,020
With a training platform

281
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:36,300
You have to work with with a group that really knows this stuff that knows the scenario you should be building out and that it

282
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,540
Actually is one that you would face in the real world that difference

283
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,800
That's Linux Academy and you can take advantage of by going to linux academy.com slash unplugged

284
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,460
It supports this show and it also helps you get ahead

285
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:55,460
It's a great way to bump up that resume fill some time or even just challenge yourself Linux academy.com slash unplugged

286
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:01,300
They've got courses on pretty much everything if you're just if you're if you're not really sure where to start

287
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,580
Why not go in there and scratch an inch?

288
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:10,140
Maybe this is the time to finally make that backup solution for your photos holidays are coming up

289
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,900
You're gonna be snapping a lot of pictures

290
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,940
Wouldn't be great going to know in going into that to know that you could create your own backup solution for that

291
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,940
They've got coursewares on that. It's really

292
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,820
It's so much opportunity and they're always adding new stuff

293
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:27,940
Linux academy.com slash unplugged and a big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring Linux unplugged programs you guys

294
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,340
Rockstars over there. I can't believe how hard they work and make me look like a slacker. I don't even like

295
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,540
Okay, just we'll get a cup before we bring Todd on from purism

296
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,540
I just want to get to a couple of more emails

297
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,020
Just so we can get through these because I feel bad when we don't get to all the emails

298
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:49,540
And this next one is a perspective that it's hard for us to sometimes take on the show and yes

299
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:55,580
I know we talked about system D a lot, but I think we should make a little more space up for it considering that on Sundays

300
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:01,580
Linux action show it's gonna be a lot of positive stuff because we interviewed Lenart Pottering about among a many many things

301
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:09,320
System D and we're gonna hear a lot of his side of the story. So mr. P writes in from the slackware side of the camp

302
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,140
He says hey Chris and the rest of the crew. Thanks for all the hard work on the shows. I'm a slack wear user

303
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,260
since

304
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:22,580
1995 both private and in my daily work. He says I'm a programmer for an embedded Linux and I do some system administration

305
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:28,100
I've listened about all of the talk regarding system D and I'd like you to address part of this discussion. That's missing

306
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,740
We don't use system D in slackware

307
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:38,200
The big problem for us in slackware is that many packages nowadays are requiring system D to be able to build or to run

308
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,980
The tone in the slack or community is respectful towards system D

309
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,020
But it's hard for us to see the impact on all 30 on all third-party applications

310
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,320
And I think by that he means it's hard for us to see this when we don't use system D

311
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,060
But yet these requirements are coming up when I listen to you on air

312
00:23:54,060 --> 00:24:01,020
It seems like you're surrounded by only pro system D people regards Pierre or para. I'm not I'm not sure so I

313
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:07,060
Wanted to give I wanted to open the floor to anybody in the mumba room that has some concerns about system D

314
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,700
Maybe we could just have an open discussion about them. I don't know if we have anybody

315
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,060
I think Fred was our biggest of vocal anti system D user last week

316
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,140
Is anybody in the mumba room have concerns about system? Do they want a voice?

317
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,900
It's an open. It's not lower

318
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:26,260
Not really. I think this might be an opportunity for us to try and get one of the one guys

319
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:34,060
Yeah, he mr. P recommended somebody from slackware that we could bring on and I'm gonna forward that in contact input of the production staff

320
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,060
so

321
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:38,300
Here's what I'm trying to get to here's why I asked you guys because we have it

322
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,300
we don't we have a good sized room here and

323
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:48,580
You know, I I suspect that the reason why there's not a lot of anti system D commentary on this show is

324
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,700
I think it's reflective of the overall opinion

325
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,960
I think a lot of us maybe have concerns, but we also see that it's sort of a competitiveness necessity for Linux

326
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,120
Wimpy you say you you might have some concerns. What would those be?

327
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:10,320
Well, yeah, I mean in general I'm very supportive of system D and I think it's a good thing, but my one concern about system

328
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,920
D is

329
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,240
scope creep

330
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,280
it doesn't seem to have a well-defined road map of where it's heading and

331
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,080
New facilities and features seem to be blossoming

332
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,240
into the system did yeah and

333
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:31,280
Isn't clear where where the edges of that project are right? Well, I think you know

334
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,560
It's not to speak for Lenart, but I think he would define it as

335
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,480
Anything that kind of sits between user land and kernel could be fair game

336
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,040
And and it's quite a big stretch of land. Yes, it is, isn't it?

337
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,200
Yeah, it is it is a very big stretch of land and

338
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,640
I'm trying to think of like how other operating systems do it and I'm you know

339
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,880
When I think of the commercial OS is like when I think of Windows

340
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,360
Windows has what comes to my mind and maybe this isn't a fair parallel

341
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,700
But Windows has a SVC host right SVS host am I getting that right?

342
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,800
Which is this huge parent process that controls?

343
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:14,400
Ungodly amounts of things and I it is totally opaque to me. I have no idea what it does now

344
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,000
Here's the thing about now. Here's my response to what you're saying wimpy is

345
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:26,980
The way system D is going about and replacing these individual bits of functionality like take NTP for example, right?

346
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:32,940
It's doing it with individual programs. It's not like it's all

347
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:39,700
There's not a system D binary right that it has all this code in it

348
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:44,220
It is individual programs that are part of the system D project

349
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,940
But they are they are broken out in in small bits of functionality

350
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:54,720
Which I think a makes it easier to kind of it gives you insight because you can see the tool

351
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,560
B it makes it easier to replace just that component if you replace it with something else, right?

352
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,960
Because it's just this NTP piece. I have to replace or just this DG DHCP client piece

353
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,760
I have to repeat replace. It's not the whole system D binary. So I

354
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,440
Agree that that is a problem

355
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,400
But I think the balance of system D strikes by replacing it with individual small tools

356
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,800
That just happen to all communicate really well to each other

357
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:26,920
Is a pretty reasonable approach to that and I think too like you have to look at some of the things that have been replaced

358
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,560
And be honest and say, you know, some of these things were kind of neglected, right?

359
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,280
And not in all cases, but in some cases, they were just kind of a hot mess that were neglected

360
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,720
Yeah, I

361
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:43,080
Appreciate how system D is put together and that everything isn't lumped in together in one binary and there is a set of tools

362
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:50,680
And I don't thinking about it. I don't think there's anything that's been added to system day that I haven't found useful or

363
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Can see a rationale for?

364
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,440
My concern is more looking into the future

365
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:03,120
Where will it continue to grow and what will the scope of the project become because that isn't that isn't clear?

366
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:10,240
Nobody knows right dare Devlin. Do you believe that system D taking over these more and more functionalities?

367
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,040
Actually will make for a more nimble Linux system

368
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,980
Yeah, I

369
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:22,740
Think it's the closeness is actually something that I feel that we're missing other departments as well. Actually

370
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:30,060
What do you mean as things that actually go and talk to each other but are being developed in this?

371
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,860
widespread

372
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,220
Multiple repos pretty much it's all over and I

373
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:44,260
Think the closeness that the system deep project made for the multiple programs is essential to actually

374
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,340
Keep the projects in check and actually in pair with each other

375
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,480
Mm-hmm, although I do kind of also agree with what peacemaker is saying in that

376
00:28:54,180 --> 00:29:01,060
It doesn't leave a lot of rooms for distros like slackware or gentoo or or any of the others dev one that

377
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,360
Don't want anything to do a system deal. Like there's not a lot of air left in the room

378
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,860
So that is a difficult thing because I think we I think most of us would agree monoculture is bad

379
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,100
even if the monoculture is made up of a lot of little bits, so I

380
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,600
I think these can so one of the things that I maybe well then we'll move on because I we've touched on enough but

381
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,260
one of the things that I think we forget is

382
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,060
That the future is changeable

383
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,580
And if we get to a point in the future where there is a big downside to going with system D

384
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,720
The open source community will write itself

385
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:42,400
It will it will write that ship and it will make a course correction and it's the future is not set in stone

386
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,160
So if a lot of input a lot of things today are written for system D

387
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,480
That does not mean that in five years. Everything is going to depend on system D

388
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,660
It it might mean that we go through a period of time

389
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,780
Where a lot of things but you know what?

390
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:59,760
We went through a period of time where a lot of things were written for ulcer and now a lot of things are written for

391
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:06,160
Pulse, right? It just changes things happen and technology is fundamentally changeable and

392
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,080
especially

393
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:15,960
especially open source software like like I I totally legit get the concern if this was Windows or Mac OS X and it was

394
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,820
Happening happening behind closed doors and we as a community could do nothing about it

395
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,800
But anyone can write code anyone can write a patch and it just takes one person to start a change

396
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,760
We are not under the same constraints. We would be in a totally proprietary commercial system

397
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,800
But yet I feel like our reaction here is like the future is set in stone if we make this decision

398
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:42,440
Everything is ruined. We can never write the ship it but that's that's that's totally opposite of how open source works

399
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,460
So for me, it's like I I totally respect like god

400
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,960
It does suck that the slack where project is getting the air sucked out of the room then again

401
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,860
It doesn't mean there will always be no air in the room

402
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,000
There could be air that comes back in the future and it's not it

403
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It's just we should move forward

404
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,560
And I'll just leave it at that and it with the interview with Lenart goes into some detail about this

405
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,700
I think it's a good pre setup for that

406
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,120
so if this topic interests you at all or any of the

407
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,100
community trolling topics or future of software distribution on Linux and how that might be

408
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,420
Accomplished all of those were covered in the interview with Lenart and that'll be in Sunday's Linux action show

409
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,400
So far, that's what we have. That's when we have a scheduled to air

410
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:24,280
so hopefully we can just sort of air that and and I totally I'm still willing to take input and and

411
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,840
Talk about the topic, but also I have to respect if the audience is done with done with it

412
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,160
I don't want to dwell on it

413
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,320
but I find it to be a fascinating change and

414
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:38,080
there was an article that I talked about the Linux action show about how net BSD community reacted to the same kind of thing 14

415
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,160
Years ago and it does really feel a lot like history kind of repeating itself

416
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,760
Just you know, a lot of us don't remember there was a huge debate over X, right?

417
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,800
There's a lot of things that have happened in the community that have kind of gone by the wayside now

418
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:55,680
There was a huge debate over not as big as system D but over a gel a GILX or XGL

419
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,740
For composited desktops and we don't even use either of those anymore and there was a big debate about it

420
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:07,200
So the future is not fixed that that would be that would be my my ending piece for our system to discussion

421
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,700
All right, so we're gonna talk to Todd here in just a second

422
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,900
Why don't I do one more sponsor break and then we'll bring Todd in and it's kind of a special a special sponsor break

423
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,840
So everybody knows ting we love ting go to linux.ting.com. You're gonna get a $25 discount off

424
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,140
Your first device ting is mobile that makes sense and Matt and I have been using ting for cheese man almost two years now

425
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,120
Wow already good grief

426
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,600
It is nuts and I got some I got some stats

427
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,360
Right here from ting about the Jupiter broadcasting audience that I thought I'd share as we as we approach our second year

428
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:43,800
So the average bill for Linux action show audience members and the Linux unplugged and any JB audience member

429
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,480
That has one device the average monthly bill

430
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,380
$26 whoa now

431
00:32:52,200 --> 00:33:00,060
Let that sit for a second. This is a full-featured smartphone. You only pay for what you use. There's no contract nor the termination fee

432
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,360
$26 is the average Jupiter broadcasting audience members monthly bill now

433
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,040
What are you paying today for your cell phone bill? Is it more than $26?

434
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,240
Do you have a contract on top of that go to linux.ting.com, but?

435
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,640
Now right now is truly the best time to ever switch to ting if you've been thinking about it

436
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,240
So you you've probably heard me mention that ting has an early termination relief program

437
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,600
And they're gonna give you 25% of the ETF which is you know about $75

438
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,240
So if you figure the average bill is $26, and you're gonna get a $75 credit

439
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,920
That's almost three months of free ting service. That's a really good deal. Yeah, that would be I would I would take that deal

440
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:43,760
But ting is upping the game for a little while until January 5th

441
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,240
They're gonna take that ETF relief program, and they're gonna make it 50%

442
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,940
They're gonna give you a hundred and fifty dollars in maximum credit when you switch to ting if you have a contract right now

443
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,040
So noodle this over

444
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,720
You go to linux.ting.com you're gonna get a $25 service credit if you bring a device

445
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,280
Or you get $25 off your first device if you don't have one you bring a device

446
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:09,280
You're gonna get $25 of credit if you have a contract to terminate you're gonna get another

447
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,920
$150 in credit that means you get a max of

448
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:20,080
$175 in ting credits just by going to linux.ting.com and by taking advantage of the early termination relief program

449
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,900
$175 in service credits for no contract

450
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,560
Only paying for what you use just your minutes your messages and your megabytes plus the flat $6 for the phone

451
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,320
No hold customer service their incredible dashboard

452
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,320
full access to your phone

453
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:42,800
Great community if you want to run one of the alternative operating systems like Ubuntu touch sailfish OS or Firefox OS they have an active

454
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,440
enthusiastic community around that

455
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,160
And you could turn it on right now

456
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,920
You don't have to call anybody if you don't want you can use their web interface you can get up to $175 in credit now

457
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,680
If you go to linux.ting.com you don't have a contract you're still gonna get our $25 service credit

458
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
Which will still get you probably more than your first month

459
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,680
this is such a great time and

460
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,960
If I were you and by the way if you want to read more about it for yourself

461
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
You can go to their blog

462
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,320
They've got all the details up on their blog like they always do ting is super great about that

463
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,680
It's really easy to track what this company's up to because they they're really transparent

464
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,640
They put it all up there

465
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,240
And you can read it through it and you can it's such a great way to get your mind around what this company's about

466
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,980
But check this out. I think one of the best smartphones ever made

467
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,200
The HTC one the m7 with those awesome front-facing speakers, which are amazing for podcast listening

468
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:33,040
You can own it outright three hundred and forty dollars from ting right now. No contract

469
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,960
$340 and you only pay for what you use that is the with this phone

470
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,520
So I don't I don't have like Bluetooth in my truck. I don't have like an aux in Jack in my truck

471
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,360
I don't but I don't listen to the radio

472
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:52,440
I only listen to podcasts when I drive and I use this phone I did with these front-facing speakers

473
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,880
I didn't need a soundbar now that I have my Nexus 5 I'm back on a Bluetooth soundbar

474
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,280
This I this is the phone like this is the one that got away. I gave it to Rekai. I

475
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:06,880
Gave it to Rekai's got my HTC one and I I I covet it and you can get it now for three hundred and forty dollars

476
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,600
Go to linux.ting.com. They'll give you a $25 discount on that device if you have a contract you need to terminate

477
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:17,280
They're gonna pay more than they've ever paid until January this only good till January 5th, so why not do it now

478
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,280
I get it in this year, right

479
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,360
$75 used to be the old deal

480
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:27,120
Now now there's no $150 if you got if you have a contract you got to go and then your contract free you can turn

481
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,860
On hotspot tethering when you need it. It's so slick linux.ting.com

482
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:38,400
Seriously do Chris us all go get yourself treat yourself. It's the holiday season the HTC one. It's the Cadillac

483
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,920
I mean the M8s they have the M8 too. I think it's more probably I who needs it

484
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,380
This is such an amazing phone the HTC one m7 three hundred forty dollars

485
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:53,100
Linux dot ting comm and a huge thank you to ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged you guys are crushing it for the holiday season

486
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:58,300
Just a great opportunity to if you wanted to give somebody a phone and then not have to stick them to a contract

487
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,300
Ting's a great way to go

488
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,580
You avoid that nastiness well

489
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,620
Matt let's well. Let's welcome Todd on the show

490
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:11,100
Todd is from purism, and they are currently crowdfunding the Librem 15 a

491
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:18,140
Free Libre software laptop that respects your essential freedoms, and I've crowdfunded it. It's currently

492
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,620
29 days left on the crowdfunding effort. They've raised

493
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,580
$41,000 with a goal of

494
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,780
$250,000 and Todd welcome to Linux unplugged why don't you start by telling us?

495
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,320
Why are you doing a crowdfunding campaign for a Linux laptop? What's the goal here?

496
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,180
Yeah, well, thanks for having me on and

497
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:43,460
So what we're doing is we are clearly crowdfunding to reach a minimum order quantity to manufacture a motherboard that has

498
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,020
the best

499
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,380
free software support

500
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,100
on any laptop

501
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:57,980
So this quantity of two of two hundred fifty thousand dollars is essentially to meet the obligations of a custom motherboard

502
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:06,220
That's correct. Yeah, and actually the way that that typically works when you manufacture motherboard is you're talking about minimum order quantities of 5,000

503
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:13,460
What we've done is worked with the manufacturer of the motherboard to pay to prepay the NRE fees

504
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,380
So that we can get a small enough order quantity in

505
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,340
So that way we can do a smaller a smaller run of units

506
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:26,900
So that's why we can actually do it for just a quarter of a million dollars as opposed to what's typically a five million dollar

507
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,620
a

508
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:37,380
Minimum order quantity so Todd you you you pitched the Librem 15 as the first high-end laptop that ships without any mystery software and

509
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:44,500
That obviously resonated pretty well with me. I like the look of it. It's it's a metal housing. Is it aluminum or is it plastic?

510
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,540
What is it? It's aluminum housing. Well, it looks really sharp and it's got a

511
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,100
decent range of specs

512
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:57,460
And it ships currently with Triskel is the distribution of choice, right? So if it doesn't

513
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,580
Okay

514
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:03,060
So I the first thing that jumped out of me and we can get into this maybe because I think this is probably the biggest

515
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,660
questions on people's minds is

516
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,540
It sort of struck me a little bit as Google's don't be evil

517
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,500
Slogan where as soon as you say it, right then everybody's looking for every little evil thing you do

518
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,980
So in this one, you know, you sort of pitched it as the totally free Libre laptop

519
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:25,620
But there's an asterisk in this sense that it does ship with a BIOS that does require a binary blob

520
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,620
Can you tell us a little bit about that?

521
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,580
Yeah, correct. So it's something that we try to be very clear about actually

522
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,220
so we put it right on the front page of and also the

523
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:42,620
Certification and pretty much everything we put out there is that we we have everything from the software on meaning bootloader the kernel

524
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:49,620
The entire operating system as well as all software as of course by running Triskel all software. We even install is

525
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,820
Free and we also promote free software by by doing so

526
00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:00,180
The area that we want to free but is not currently freed is the BIOS

527
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:04,540
there's actually a binary the Intel FSP, which also includes the

528
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,020
Intel memory engine me

529
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:13,180
That is a binary provided from Intel and actually it's technically provided through a subcontractor of Intel

530
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,780
And what we want to do is have that freed

531
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,540
That is our goal and then we have a and that actually once we reach that goal

532
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,980
We would actually be able to get free software foundation respects your freedom

533
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,300
certification

534
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:32,900
But we want to go beyond that and actually certify and free firmware that actually goes into

535
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:38,060
The microcontrollers at the hardware level. So really what it comes down to for us is

536
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:46,540
We are as free as humanly possible right now, but we want to push upstream into the manufacturing which no one has done

537
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,380
to be able to free the

538
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:56,420
Microcontrollers as well as that bias. So that seems like a pretty ambitious goal. How how

539
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:01,220
realistic is a goal of that level of ambition for a

540
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,100
A company that's not the size of like an Apple or a Dell

541
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:09,620
I mean to be honest that seems almost like a fight that would be hard for an HP or Dell to win

542
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:17,020
So how does purism plan to win that battle to convince them to open these and free these? Yeah, so that's a that's a great question

543
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:21,380
So initially it's really it's about business negotiations

544
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:25,740
So initially those large companies like let's say Apple and Dell Apple and Dell have no incentive

545
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,900
Nor no belief system that will ever care to actually free anything upstream

546
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,540
so

547
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:36,620
When when we sit down at the table and negotiate with purchasing a hard drive or purchasing memory

548
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:44,920
Then we can the number one thing we're discussing is are you a company who's going to back providing us with your source?

549
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,620
under NDA or

550
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,860
where we can scrub it and release it or

551
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:58,340
providing that source under an acceptable license and then we will purchase from you or in some cases actually work with them to

552
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:04,780
Provide the documentation to the Linux kernel developers to

553
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,660
to free the

554
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,340
hardware, so it's really mostly about

555
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:16,460
That our number one topic when we're negotiating is is freeing the source code

556
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:24,460
So do you is it your observation now perhaps that perhaps other OEMs are not really concerned about this matter and not really pressuring

557
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,460
the manufacturers to do this

558
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:33,420
There's well Google clearly has and and they've actually made some decent progress on freeing the the BIOS

559
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:38,140
Working with core boot and a number of engineers who work for core boot. So that's

560
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:42,300
That's so Google is an exception to the rule clearly

561
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,500
They have other concerns for privacy and freedom

562
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:52,880
But as far as pushing upstream Google has actually made attempts to do so and and in some cases been

563
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,840
Has done quite well. The the main thing is that

564
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:04,640
There the push upstream has has really not gone all the way to the manufacturer who actually

565
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:12,680
Manufactures the actual microcontroller. It'll be to whomever's reselling it and then it'll kind of fall on deaf ears and not actually make it upstream

566
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,880
Enough. I see that makes sense. So the next thing that I think would probably jump out at the

567
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,520
sharp-eyed viewer is

568
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,080
It ships with an NVIDIA card now we are aware of the new driver

569
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:29,600
but tell me a little bit about the choice because if this is a custom motherboard that must have been an explicit choice on your

570
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,880
Part to include not just an Intel graphics, but also a separate NVIDIA chip

571
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,320
So why why include that when the Intel is there?

572
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,360
Yeah, it's funny. We had we had actually had an ongoing debate about this and

573
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,480
We could save about 75 bucks if we just throw out the NVIDIA chip

574
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:50,320
So it was a conscious decision to include it

575
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:57,860
which actually the debate was if we're going to include the hardware that can run with a

576
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,800
Free kernel level driver, but I also want to make it clear that if you even use the free kernel level driver

577
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,800
you're still loading a

578
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,320
binary from NVIDIA into the BIOS

579
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:15,420
So you actually be able to use it and you can look at the source of the nouveau driver to see that it makes a

580
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,180
lot of firmware calls

581
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,740
BIOS level calls, but so the important thing is that

582
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,220
by including both we can

583
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,100
honor our

584
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,100
purest beliefs that we

585
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:36,880
That you can run completely free software and just discard the NVIDIA, but those people who really want to include the NVIDIA

586
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,240
Have that option. So it's really more from a customization standpoint

587
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,400
But it was a debate that we went round and round

588
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,920
And one of the issues actually comes from the free software foundation, which is if you include hardware that

589
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,840
Requires or only operates it at full capacity

590
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:04,780
with a proprietary binary then it's not certifiable. So that was something we actually toyed around heavily with

591
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,700
the certification for free software foundation and

592
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:12,880
The end result was sort of it's not if so for somebody like me, you know

593
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,320
I think I I might not have been inclined to fund it if it didn't have the NVIDIA chip

594
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:21,060
So for me, it was I might not use the proprietary driver

595
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,820
But I'd like to know that in the future of my workload needs that I have it

596
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:29,300
How will that work for say this meets its goal and we get the funding? How will that work for me as an end user?

597
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,300
How do I switch between Intel and NVIDIA?

598
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:36,420
Well, it's actually called a hybrid so what I actually it's a NVIDIA 3d graphics controller

599
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:42,900
So what happens is when you're it boots and runs off of the Intel, but whenever it needs to access

600
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:48,260
3d acceleration then it uses the NVIDIA graphics so you can run full

601
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,820
The entire system off the Intel

602
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,780
And then use NVIDIA when needed you can't do it the other way around

603
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:59,500
You wouldn't be able to just use at least my understanding and our testing is that you would not be able to do that

604
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,100
And our testing is that you would not be able to just use NVIDIA

605
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,020
NVIDIA is added for the 3d control and you can see from

606
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:13,840
LSPCI output that you can actually tell that the 3d controllers on a separate PCI bus compared to the VGA. Okay, okay

607
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:19,340
Wow, so it it's it it does the driver stack handles live switching

608
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:25,140
So it sends what it sends open GL calls off to the NVIDIA chip and standard 2d calls off to the Intel chip

609
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:30,700
That's my understanding but that's actually outside of my range. I have to bring in a developer to explain more about them

610
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:36,020
Interesting though. So how are you feeling right now looking at the funding you guys have?

611
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:42,020
Let's see. I just said it but 29 days left. It is the holiday season. It's kind of probably a tough time to raise money

612
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:46,900
Do you how you feel about right right now 29 days in 16% funded?

613
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:51,220
Yeah, so, you know clearly what the the trending for most crowdfunding is

614
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:57,220
that you initially have a pretty good push and then it kind of plateaus for a while until the end because there's a lot of

615
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:01,780
People who will sign up for the mailing list or notify me when it's ending. So we're getting an awful lot of

616
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,060
interest

617
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:08,820
specifically with you know notify me as the as the days start to

618
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:14,740
Dwindle, but you're right in the fact that launching during this time was actually a tough decision for us

619
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:18,100
We we actually considered running it through the middle of January

620
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,100
Because

621
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,100
Getting after the holidays and people clearly aren't buying for themselves and this is going to ship in

622
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,940
You know end of March

623
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:33,320
April timeframe anyway, so we decided to go ahead with it now

624
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,380
because

625
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:42,580
Just the mostly trying to bring it to market the timing is right for our negotiations and trying to get some leverage with the manufacturers

626
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:45,460
So we decided to take that leap, but I feel really good right there right now

627
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,620
so

628
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,060
I guess kind of what I'm grokking from what you're telling me is

629
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:58,780
There's not really a straightforward way to do a custom-built for Linux laptop in a one two

630
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:06,480
Three four level quantity maybe one sale two sales three sales every day in order to have leverage with the manufacturer

631
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,100
You've got to be able to cut them a big fat check

632
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:15,380
And so that kind of does that is that dictating the crowd supply funding approach instead of just taking an order here and there as people

633
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,420
Want them?

634
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:21,220
That's exactly right so I mean clearly we can we can buy you know something off of the shelf

635
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:27,500
And then install Linux on it and ship it and then that's really what I consider the the old days of Linux

636
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:34,780
I actually want to change that in the sense that I want to push the GNU Linux system upstream where we're actually shipping it by default

637
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,780
Manufacturing it specifically for that

638
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:41,820
So to be able to do that. We can't just buy onesie-twosie

639
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:48,820
and if we did we could just launch it on our site and sell them you know one-offs the the point here is to see if

640
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,820
there's enough interest in

641
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,580
producing

642
00:48:53,580 --> 00:49:01,180
Manufacturing and basically backing a company that wants to push the free software movement up into the manufacturing chain

643
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:06,300
so that we can design and manufacture and ship products that's

644
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:13,700
Specifically targeted towards this audience. Yeah, I mean that seems like a total catch-22 because to make this experience better

645
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:21,300
For future Linux laptops you have to have that initial leverage at the negotiation table to make it worth their time to go to the

646
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:26,180
trouble of freeing these binaries in this documentation and the source code up so

647
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:31,660
It seems to be a unique situation so why crowd supply versus something like Kickstarter?

648
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:35,140
I'm just curious because I see a lot of hardware open source hardware funded these days

649
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:40,260
And I'm seeing different sites use so what crowd supply offer that maybe a Kickstarter didn't well. There's a couple things

650
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:48,660
The first is actually I got to meet the founder of crowd supply and I was quite impressed with their capabilities

651
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,540
They also

652
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:55,700
Did back bunny bunnies novena project which I think is a great

653
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:01,820
Project clearly from a maker standpoint right where he actually manufactured the motherboard himself

654
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:05,620
That's fantastic. And so they had you know experience with

655
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:14,980
Supporting the free and open source world and they also actually have worked with the free software foundation through my introduction actually to

656
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:21,880
Make sure that people can buy with without JavaScript enabled. So they're going to become the first free

657
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,540
software and foundation endorsed

658
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,380
Crowdfunding website. So that's great. That's also great in my mind

659
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:31,980
So those are those are a couple decisions why we went with crowd supply over anything else. So

660
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:37,660
Todd give us a little bit of your background. Have you been involved in free and open source software for a while?

661
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,580
Yeah, I've been

662
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,580
ever since

663
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,620
Debian

664
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,420
0.2 days so about

665
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,900
1994 been a Debian developer

666
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:54,620
I was actually a Debian developer before it took arm and a leg to become a Debian developer and then

667
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,900
since fell out of that and

668
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,340
I've been installing Debian forever

669
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:05,740
Over a hundred thousand units installed when I saw when I was system architects at a couple different companies

670
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,500
I'd use fully automated installation to

671
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,100
build deploy

672
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:14,140
Debian based multimedia services or

673
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:21,880
Audio based services. So if you go into most retailers, you'll go into and you'll hear their audio over the

674
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:25,060
in the store and that'll run a system that's

675
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:30,900
60% of them are going to be a system that I was a system architect on which are all going to be a Debian based

676
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,100
multimedia system

677
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:39,480
Very cool. That's a pretty big runs Linux and I I suppose then have you is is this in some way?

678
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:45,460
I'm imagining you're probably a bit like me where you finally been like none of these laptops have satisfied me and I've

679
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:50,060
Found myself to be pretty happy with a certain subset of laptops

680
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:54,920
I'm mostly one of our sponsor system 76 makes some great laptops that run Linux really well

681
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:59,820
But when I go out in the market and I look out I look for laptops that are custom-built for Linux

682
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,380
There's there's not a lot out there

683
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:08,140
There's plenty of room left in the market and something that's metal and really tightly will belt will well built

684
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:13,460
I often will look over the Macbooks and go man. If those could flawlessly run Linux I would consider it

685
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,980
But until that day it's not for me

686
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:21,340
So I always felt like I've kind of been in this zone of searching and never really found the perfect solution for me personally

687
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,980
So is that what sort of motivated you to start this project?

688
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:28,180
That actually it's interesting. I mean I might as well have recorded that and played it back

689
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:33,540
That's that is one of the driving forces of why I formed purism is for four decades

690
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,140
Well, maybe not decades, but over a decade

691
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:43,700
I have been hunting for you know every year right or every year and a half or so getting a nude laptop

692
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,980
Where I bought from I think penguin I bought from the system 76

693
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,700
and

694
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:56,300
You know I've always liked the fact that what they believe in and what they promote has been great the laptops themselves arrive

695
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,900
And you know they are

696
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,900
off the shelf

697
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:04,940
products that can be purchased in ones or order quantities of ten usually and then

698
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:11,340
Stripped installed Linux and delivered it so I've never really been

699
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:18,260
Perfect you know really satisfied, and I think to your point is you know I have for one consulting gig

700
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,760
They ship me a Macbook Pro

701
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,900
And I really like the hardware

702
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:29,340
I you know I thought it was it was well-built it clearly would last and so for me

703
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:34,820
I wanted to get something that was custom built for specifically for GNU Linux where all the chips would work

704
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,260
without any binaries and and then just decided to

705
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:43,580
If no one else had done it that I might as well be the one yeah, I could I could understand that well

706
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:47,460
So in my room if you guys have any questions go ahead and speak up

707
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:52,380
But Todd I I would I'll have a link in the show notes, and I would encourage people to go check it out

708
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:58,700
So it one last question say yeah, this makes its funding. Can I put more than eight gigabytes of RAM?

709
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,740
What's the limitation because I see right now in the drop-down?

710
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,360
It's eight gigs is that a physical limitation

711
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:07,340
Or is that just the specs you've offered like can I put up to 32 gigs or give me an idea of like the expandability in

712
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:10,120
This thing that's that is our number one question, so

713
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:15,860
So right now we actually are going back to our reference design to actually increase that to 32

714
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:22,860
It is a physical limitation right now in our design. However, that is something we can change the issue actually it comes down to

715
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,260
The space within it

716
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:33,180
So what we're doing is we might end up having to do something where you can go with a secondary solid-state drive in the in the

717
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:38,940
CD-rom DVD-rom drive bay and then be able to expand your memory

718
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:45,060
So we're basically looking within you know trying not to because I can't change the case right so I'm looking at

719
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,720
ways in which we can fit

720
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:53,780
More memory within the same footprint sure and you know what as somebody who I've bought a few CD-ROMs recently

721
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:58,700
Are my more recent purchases and haven't used them like once I used them like the for the first time this last weekend

722
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,220
So I would totally take that offer that off

723
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:06,780
Yes, we end up when we have that offer now you can swap the CD DVD for a second bay of solid-state driver

724
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:11,460
Or hard drive if you want, but the so the issue ends up being clearly a drive is

725
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:15,860
Smaller in footprint so we can end up it would be almost it would be a requirement

726
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,980
Potentially a requirement to drop the DVD and go with an extra RAM

727
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:25,340
but we're still toying with that and we'll update the the

728
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:32,660
Project page once we get the confirmation to be able to go up as much but a lot of people like on the cubes OS

729
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:39,940
Are they really want to have more than 8 gig because for running VM software? It's you know you need to have a lot more

730
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,300
RAM

731
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:46,580
Alright, that was all of my questions wimpy. I know you had one that'll probably be of interest to the audience go ahead

732
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:51,820
Yeah, so you already spoke about the FSS certification

733
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:57,260
And I wondered if you might try and find out if they're going to be flexible on that if you can run the laptop in

734
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:03,300
Say an Intel GPU only mode and therefore you're unlocking the full potential of what that

735
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:09,240
Configuration is capable of if they may endorse or certify the the laptop

736
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:17,820
Yeah, actually the that is that would happen the the hang-up with the free software foundation certification is actually the BIOS binary

737
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:20,520
the Intel FSP or Intel me

738
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,960
That binary is the one that is the we have to free that

739
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,760
Which we're working towards we have a couple of avenues to produce a free

740
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:39,280
Completely free BIOS so we use core boot, but we'd have to still use this Intel FSP binary inside of core boot to

741
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,560
Actually boot the machine

742
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:46,040
It's and it's a long-sorted story of what as as you know

743
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,360
It's moved out of the kernel and more and more into the BIOS level for these controls

744
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:53,640
So to answer your question directly the free software foundation

745
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,680
The main blocker for us getting the respects your freedom

746
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:04,580
Certification is the Intel BIOS to free the BIOS. It is not

747
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,960
Having a secondary video card that is

748
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,400
Available to use as a binary. We're with a binary

749
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:16,200
That makes sense. So I think the other this is a common question

750
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,400
I see it right now in the chat room and I've seen it when I covered it before

751
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,000
I don't actually hold this opinion

752
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,840
but I think a lot of people think it's

753
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:27,040
Expensive for the specs and I'm thinking that might be due to the quantities or the scale of the build

754
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:31,240
Do you want to touch on the pricing and out and why it is the price that it is?

755
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,080
Yeah, it's I mean clearly I'd love to sell it for 200 bucks

756
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:41,880
I could but the the issue is exactly to describe when when we're talking about manufacturing a motherboard

757
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,880
we have a minimum order quantity to be able to

758
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,720
to

759
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:51,640
Place that order to actually have the motherboard manufactured. It's all about the tooling

760
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:57,360
So we paid an NRE fee to get it down from a 5,000 unit order to really in the few hundreds

761
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,360
So what of course that means is that our per unit cost has to go up

762
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,320
And so we're taking us

763
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,520
We have the belief that people will back

764
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:14,460
The business because of the belief system and what we're trying to do and understand that it's a short-term

765
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,820
a

766
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:20,060
Larger price tag to be able to get to a completely free manufactured

767
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:24,300
Device later with the lower price tag when we can actually order it in larger volumes

768
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:30,180
So if we were to be able to place an order for 5,000 units, then we could actually have that price probably cut at least

769
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:36,260
At least it would be it'd be close to a half the price Wow. Well that makes sense, too

770
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,900
I mean, it's that's sort of just the dynamics of the market

771
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:42,880
So Todd, I really do wish you the best luck and you guys can go to crowd supply.com

772
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,640
And look for the Librem 15 from purism and we'll have a link in the show notes

773
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,600
You can go directly to it

774
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:52,000
And if you all go back at then I'll probably get mine and then I'll give you a review on the Linux action show

775
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
But Todd you are welcome to stick around

776
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:59,240
well, we're gonna continue on with the show and I wish you the best of luck and I

777
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:05,120
Hope I get mine in around March or April timeframe. That'd be really cool. Hey, thanks so much for having me

778
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,640
So we're gonna I want to talk about

779
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,840
Something the core OS project is doing and I want to break it down because I think it's huge

780
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:17,480
And I think it's super necessary and it's already been piled on by the free software press

781
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:22,280
That's not that's not even a thing by the people who pretend to be press of the free software movement

782
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,960
They've already called it the container war

783
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,380
Battle I'm gonna tell you what's really going on

784
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:35,960
We're gonna break it down for you guys and it's actually a really really good thing

785
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,160
But first I got to tell you about a really great thing

786
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:43,400
That's digital ocean head over to digital ocean comm right now and go get yourself your own simple cloud server

787
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,520
Digital ocean is dedicated to offering the most intuitive an easy way for you to spin up your own

788
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:53,880
Server and you can probably do so in less than 55 seconds pricing plan start at only five dollars

789
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:59,040
That'll get you 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer

790
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:05,440
It's awesome because digital ocean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam and London

791
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,800
I got an email from my listener Patrick today, and he's like Chris

792
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:14,640
You've taught you've talked a lot about things you use your digital ocean droplet for but have you ever considered the fact that five

793
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:20,900
Dollars a month is cheaper than most any really good minecraft hosting solution out there and with digital ocean

794
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,760
Not only do you get the ability to host your own minecraft server?

795
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,480
But you get the snapshots and the backup and the templates right and it's of course minecrafts one example

796
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,560
It could be wordpress gitlab doesn't matter bit torrent sync sync thing

797
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:37,720
Why not roll your own sync thing solution and the digital ocean droplet could be the off-site cloud storage?

798
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,720
You know you don't need anything else

799
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,960
But it's really about the interface. This is kind of why I think digital ocean

800
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:49,200
They sort of broke through the barrier when it came to making this something that's accessible to anybody like you know you can be

801
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:56,320
A 15 year server admin you could be a 10 minute server admin, and you're going to find the digital ocean dashboard is amazing

802
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:01,720
It's intuitive and power user can replicate it on a larger scale with a straightforward api and for

803
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:08,960
Me I can't use that api I couldn't I couldn't use an api to save my life like I could look at him

804
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,080
Oh, so that's how you do that, but to actually use it no now

805
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,280
I know for a lot of you out there your roll in your eyes and like oh Chris

806
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,680
You're such an old man, and that's great because it's then you can take advantage of it today

807
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:22,160
But for me I take advantage of all the awesome community resources built around that api

808
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:27,800
There's applets for your linux desktop. There's ways to snap it in with your existing management infrastructure command lines

809
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,960
It's so cool, and one of the things that we love about digital ocean you can go over there

810
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,280
And you can apply our discount to your balance

811
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:37,080
This is a great way if you forgot to use it when you signed up now

812
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:41,400
We're doing the transition between months right now, so we have two promo codes right now

813
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,360
I know that unplug November works for you

814
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,880
So you can go over there and use the promo code unplug November and get a ten dollar credit

815
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:53,120
Then you can try out the five dollar rig for two months for absolutely for nothing for free, but it turns out

816
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,280
It's December so unplug December is probably going to start working later this afternoon

817
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,760
And you can go over there and use that as well and get the ten dollar credit go check it out

818
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,560
Really if you're even a casual linux user

819
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:08,240
This is such a fun experience and since you get it for free

820
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:13,520
Why not just try it for a little month for a couple of months and just play with it. It's so neat

821
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:19,320
I have right now. I have my Quasals core up there and one of the things that turns turns out didn't know this about Quasal

822
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,200
But when you're in all these chat rooms logging all the time that database

823
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,160
Gets big like eight gigabytes big

824
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,080
And if I didn't have that sucker sitting on an SSD drive

825
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:34,200
I I would be in a world of hurt every time I go to open up my IRC client

826
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:40,760
But because digital ocean has incredible bandwidth speeds has those SSD drives when I open up my IRC clients boom it all gets pushed down

827
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:45,160
To me it's amazing the amount of transfer. I get and it's all I get to a terabyte for free

828
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:48,640
And then digital ocean has easy step plans to upgrade to the pricing in fact

829
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,400
They have it all listed out on their site. You just click that pricing tab, and it's really straightforward and the other thing that's cool

830
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,720
Hourly pricing you know like your favorite hotel

831
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:01,480
They have hourly pricing over digital oceans if you need to scale for a little while you're doing a big deployment something like that

832
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:06,720
You can spin up a server and then shut it down when you're done and digital oceans up in the game on the tutorials for

833
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:11,200
The community in fact Patrick who sent in the email about his minecraft server

834
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:18,820
used a digital ocean community tutorial to set up that minecraft server and this what's neat is they realize this is a

835
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:25,260
Massive advantage that they have over their competition so instead of just sitting there and just kind of sitting back and be like oh yeah

836
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,840
Everybody write it in no

837
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:31,800
They're actually gonna pay you and they're gonna have editing staff that's gonna work with you you can earn up to

838
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,000
$200 to write a tutorial for digital ocean now if you are a Linux geek

839
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:42,760
And you know how to set something up like a frickin minecraft server why not go make $200 seriously now somebody already took that one

840
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,680
But there's hundreds of other topics you could write and work with their staff

841
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:52,960
digital ocean comm unplug November to get that ten dollar dollar credit try out that five dollar dollar rig for two months for

842
01:03:53,400 --> 01:04:01,460
Absolutely free so freaking cool. It is the coolest thing ever seriously as somebody who's worked in IT for 15 years

843
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:07,620
When I see this, I'm sorry. I cannot help but geek out today after all of this time

844
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:11,380
I've been using digital ocean for months and months and months. I still sit down. I think

845
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:19,300
The holy smokes this is crazy cool the fact that they saw the potential behind SSD when nobody would touch SSD because of the cost

846
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,820
The fact that they saw that KVM was an awesome

847
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:26,860
Virtualization platform before anybody else saw it and then they build it all on top of Linux and they integrate with core OS

848
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:30,860
They're all about that Docker one-click deployments. It's so slick

849
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:37,220
It's such a good system and on top of all of that you get the satisfaction of supporting your favorite podcast network

850
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:40,340
Digital ocean comm use the promo code unplug November

851
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:46,140
Seriously go see what I've been talking about and a huge. Thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring Linux unplugged

852
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,460
Alright, Matt. I don't know if you saw the big hoopla

853
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:57,460
But you know dockers all the rage these days everybody's talking about Docker right well core OS wants to talk about rocket

854
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:01,580
Mm-hmm wimpy did you see the announcement about rocket I?

855
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:07,860
Have not no all right all right good. I'm gonna teach you something today wimpy so buckle up here we go

856
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:14,260
I am super excited about rocket so you put your pants on the outside of your trousers now my pajamas

857
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:19,660
The fact he's wearing pants at all is just like it. No. I'm just keep in mind his pajamas. Let's not get crazy

858
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:24,980
All right, so you if you listen depending on who you read like the register

859
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:30,300
I apparently a new Linux container war has begun. That's crap right. That's that's total crap first of all

860
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,300
I want to set something up right up front

861
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:37,180
Core OS is not moving away from Docker Docker will continue to ship in core OS and be well supported

862
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:43,220
And I want to give you the recap because the core OS guys which who we've interviewed on Linux action show I

863
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,300
Tried to talk to Mark Shuttleworth about it last week

864
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,800
And he very quickly changed the topic which to me was

865
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:54,220
Maybe an indicator that he's a he's aware of the heat that core OS is bringing. There's already major clients

866
01:05:54,220 --> 01:06:00,500
Enterprise great clients that use core OS the whole idea behind core OS right is you you isolate out a lot of the

867
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:05,340
Applications and the server services into containers, and then you just roll that base, baby

868
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:11,020
You get that open SSL patch you get that shell shock that you patch patch patch mother because you know what all the maps are

869
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:17,260
In containers, and it's safe well. That's the idea, but the problem is and this is something that's been bothering me for a while

870
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:22,920
Docker has gotten big, and I don't mean like big code wise I mean big like

871
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:26,680
publicity wise big company wise big

872
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:34,400
Contracts wise and docker is expanding out way way beyond the original vision right it's a whole platform docker is not a

873
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:41,720
Container anymore docker is a platform of services in which container ization is one of those things

874
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,120
So that's where core OS picks up

875
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,120
They say when docker was first introduced in

876
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:53,160
Early 2013 the idea of a standard container was striking and immediately attractive a simple component a composable unit

877
01:06:53,160 --> 01:07:00,080
That could be used on a variety of systems the docker repository included a manifesto of what a standard container should be

878
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:06,280
This was a rally cry to the industry and we quickly followed Brandon Phillips the co-founder and CTO of core

879
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,000
West became a top contributor to the docker project

880
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,240
He now serves on the docker board the governance board

881
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:16,840
We thought docker would become a simple unit that we could all agree on

882
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:24,520
Unfortunately a simple reusable component is not how things played out docker is now building tools for launching cloud services

883
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:33,440
Systems for clustering and a wide range of functions from functions from building images to running images uploading downloading and eventually even overlaying networking

884
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:40,560
All compiled into one monolithic binary running as root on your server the standard container manifesto was removed

885
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:45,800
We should really stop talking about docker containers and start talking about the docker platform

886
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:51,200
It's not becoming a simple composable building block. We had envisioned so they're introducing rocket

887
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,200
We still believe in the original premise of containers that docker introduced

888
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,940
So we're going to do something about it while we're at it

889
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:02,680
We're cleaning up and fixing a few things we'd like to see in a production ready container

890
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:08,880
And the things that they lay out here are things that have fundamentally bothered me about docker. I am a huge supporter of docker

891
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:12,400
I think it's great. I think it continues to be great, but a few things have bothered me

892
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:19,400
Isolation should be pluggable and the crypto primitives first trust should be strong image auditing and application identity

893
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,920
Need to exist from day one ie

894
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:26,400
Signed containers signed applications so that way when you get them distributed to you

895
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:31,340
You know they are legitimate from the original source that you expect them image distribution now

896
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:35,120
The docker hub is neat because you can check in something like smoke ping

897
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,920
Check it up to the docker hub and anybody can check it out boy

898
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:43,300
That's great, but the problem is it's centralized right? It's an open source thing. That's centralized well

899
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:45,300
We know what happens when you centralized things

900
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:50,680
Core OS thinks that discovery of container images should be simple and they should have a

901
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,720
facilitated by a federated

902
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,840
Namespace

903
01:08:54,840 --> 01:09:00,100
So you can do distributed retrieval this opens up the possibility for alternative protocols to distribute these images

904
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,800
potentially like bit torrent and

905
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:08,880
Deployments inside private environments without the need of an external registry like the docker hub

906
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,400
That's a huge one for me also

907
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:19,360
They believe the format and runtime should be well specified and developed by an open community with implementations and tools that can run

908
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:24,720
The same container consistently across different platforms rocket is what they're introducing

909
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:31,520
It's a command-line tool for running app containers an app container is a specification of an image format container runtime and discovery mechanism

910
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,760
So it's an app container tells you what it is

911
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:39,460
What the runtime stuff is you need and how you get this container?

912
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:45,900
That's what an app container is rocket is the first implementation of an app container and they expect there'll be other ones

913
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:51,840
And all of this information is linked up in the show notes, but they they have a fact that I think I want to cover

914
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,840
They say here. Why are you doing this now?

915
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:58,000
They say at Core OS we have a large serious

916
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,280
users in enterprise environments

917
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:07,380
And we cannot in good faith continue to support docker's broken security model without addressing these issues

918
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:11,600
This is something we've talked about on tech snap on several episodes of tech snap

919
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,340
There is fundamentally some issues with the docker security model

920
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:20,920
And rocket plans to address those they go on to say will core OS continue to ship docker. Yes period

921
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:24,840
We will continue to make sure core OS is the best place to run docker. So this is

922
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:28,440
Not exactly a war so much as a fundamental

923
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:32,240
Divergence of how container technology on linux should work

924
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:36,440
Now the docker project very quickly posted a follow-up

925
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:40,760
There's a lot in this, but I highlighted a few important areas

926
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:43,320
They say while docker continues to define a single container format

927
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:49,400
It's clear that our users and the vast majority of contributors and vendors want docker to enable the distributed applications

928
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:55,000
Consisting of multiple discrete containers running across multiple hosts and I in other words some of the things we're doing is

929
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,720
Because people want us to do them

930
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:03,280
We think it should it we think it would be a shame if the clean open interfaces and anywhere portability and robust set of

931
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:10,120
Ecosystem tools that exist for a single docker container applications were lost if we went to a world of multiple containers and distributed

932
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:14,920
Applications they say we'll provide more detail at dockercon conference this week in amsterdam

933
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:21,080
they go on to say we are committed to an ecosystem of users vendors and contributors whether people add value in the form of

934
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:28,360
contributions to docker as independent projects that build on the docker container format or as plug-ins to the docker orchestration api's

935
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:32,440
Or otherwise we hope that the open layered approach

936
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:37,160
Provides the best options for all so docker says we are an open layered approach. Yes

937
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,800
We have some bits and components here that we keep secret sauce

938
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,520
But we have open governance

939
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:47,640
But we have open governance. They say in some cases of course there are technical or Phil's

940
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:55,160
Philosophical differences that appears to be the case with the recent announcement of rocket we hope to address some of these technical arguments

941
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:59,120
posed by the rocket project in a subsequent post so more to come

942
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,360
Now I thought it was interesting. I this is some of you might not care at all

943
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,680
But what I found to be interesting is two things

944
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,280
Containers obviously a huge deal not new to linux

945
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:14,520
Not new to operating systems in general, but there's a lot of heat around them right now

946
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:19,960
I think that's undeniable you can look at the billions in funding that docker has gotten or I think it's a billion now

947
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:23,960
you can look at the massive pickup that a

948
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:28,240
Freshman project like core os has seen because it's based around containers

949
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:35,360
Red Hat Enterprise 7 kind of I think some could argue rushed to implement docker support because it was such a talked about feature

950
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:42,080
The largest enterprise linux distribution in the world the top granddad of enterprise linux issues that everybody recognized. Oh, it's right

951
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,040
Oh, it's right. That's right

952
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:49,240
They rushed to ship docker support because they felt the pressure to be hip and modern and have docker in there right so to have

953
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,260
To have core os one of the biggest contributors to docker

954
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,240
Come along and announce something else

955
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:00,360
People have reacted kind of strongly to this and matt you can probably guess some people have thrown their arms up in the air

956
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,360
And said oh, this is the problem with linux

957
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:07,600
Everything's always forking it yeah, it's like fork this fork that fork everyone

958
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,960
You know and I think that's kind of the attitude that comes to what kind of dwelled out of this whole thing

959
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:18,080
But I think I think they're actually I think rocket is actually going to address some serious competitive

960
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:21,920
I think it's going to bring some serious competitiveness to docker

961
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,220
I think it's like it's addressing issues that I've watched docker

962
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:31,280
Go from this is a really great way to make sure this application runs the same exact way on any distribution to

963
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:36,840
The docker platform, which is this is huge thing. It's almost too big now. I think so

964
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,120
I think you know of course

965
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:44,280
There's the old marketing law first, but as we saw with Google they can you can obviously trump that but I think the real key

966
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:49,800
Is what they're pushing forward is their big claim to fame is security that'll resonate with enterprise folks

967
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:56,280
So that may actually work out in their favor, and they may get the traction they need yeah, and I like this federated discovery system

968
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:01,160
They're talking about where the protocol to distribute the container is pluggable like it could be bit torrent

969
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:06,920
There's obviously some advantages to that especially for like smaller projects that don't have huge bandwidth capabilities

970
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,220
That's kind of a neat way to distribute things. I like to that. I maybe could have a private

971
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,720
Quote-unquote hub of these things maybe we could have like a you know an internal JB server

972
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:19,060
We check things in and out doesn't need to be up on the centralized docker hub

973
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:26,100
So I think they're actually doing and oh and also they're doing a some actual real good like serious crypto signing

974
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:30,100
They had a Google hangout today where they talked about some of the technology

975
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:34,840
They're using and why they chose it and it I think some of the hostile

976
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:41,520
attitude that people are taking away in the press is they're kind of calling docker out for not totally being enterprise ready and

977
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:46,180
Not everybody really wants to hear that, but it's the truth. I think you nailed it

978
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:52,280
I also think the fact it seems like they did wait long enough for docker to kind of absorb major funds and say okay now

979
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:56,240
What are you gonna? Do about the security issues and and then it was just dead air and so now

980
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,640
I think they're kind of like okay. You know what fine. We'll do it. Yeah

981
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:04,280
Yeah, and I think you know core OS obviously has a lot of skin in the game because they're sure and they're this isn't core

982
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:07,800
This is not going to be core OS specific code. This is gonna be open code

983
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,120
That's available to anybody use just like they did with etc D

984
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,760
And I'm I'm I'm thinking for us Linux users. This is a really good thing and

985
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,920
You know every time we talk about this of course the free BSD guys always say oh

986
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,320
We've had jails forever and the slayers guys always had zones

987
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:28,640
And you know somebody's like oh, but I've been using LXC, but the thing is is this whole?

988
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:35,480
Plug-in software and pull it down thing is is unique and special and it's I think it was sort of the tipping point that made

989
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:37,880
This sort of more of a common popular concept

990
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:42,580
I'm kind of excited about what the core OS guys are working on and so producer q5 sis is

991
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:46,180
Working to line up a chat with folks from core OS to talk to us about it

992
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:51,660
So that way we can pick their brain and kind of maybe get directly from them where they feel like docker was maybe slightly

993
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:54,940
Deficient and it needed to be replaced and what some of those serious issues

994
01:15:54,940 --> 01:16:00,640
They think they have that don't make it ready for enterprise. I'd like to get their answer on that too. Yeah, it's interesting times

995
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:07,740
It just like came out of nowhere. I wasn't really of course. I don't follow core OS super closely, but I wasn't expecting this

996
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:15,100
Mumble room any thoughts before we run on this topic last chance or forever hold your peace going once going twice and

997
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:23,660
No, and sold so q5 sis in the production chat tells me right now that we might have Brandon on Sunday to do an interview

998
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:26,700
I don't know if we'll air it in Sunday show since we have like an hour-long chat with an art

999
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:31,620
but if you tune in for the live show, you'll catch the live taping of it, and I don't know when we'll air that but

1000
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:39,180
We'll work that out. But yeah, so we should have Brandon on from core OS Brandon is one of the top contributors to Docker

1001
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:42,580
He sits on the governance board of Docker. He works on the core OS project

1002
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:47,620
He's one of the people behind rocket and he'll be joining us on the Sunday live stream to answer those questions

1003
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:50,500
If all if all the scheduling works out, so I should be tough

1004
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:54,240
Okay. Well, we just have a couple of things to cover before we run

1005
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:57,200
I'm still looking for the best of so if you go to the show notes

1006
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:01,220
You'll find a link for a form to fill out for the best of moments of Jupiter broadcasting

1007
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:04,620
We're gonna try to take the holiday week off and give people a recap of some of the best stuff

1008
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,180
You can find a link to that in the show notes

1009
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:10,260
We need your help and your suggestions of moments that you liked doesn't have to be a lot

1010
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:14,180
But you'll see the form we got all the stuff in there and don't forget

1011
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,620
We'd love to have you contact us go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact

1012
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:22,040
Choose Linux unplugged from the drop-down and send us in your feedback

1013
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:26,880
We love doing the feedback at the top of the show and you can always go to Linux action show dot reddit comm

1014
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,900
We'll have threads for this specific episode, but you can start your own thread

1015
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:35,340
Just comment on existing threads vote things up or down helps make a better show got lots of stuff, too

1016
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:37,080
I mean more and more coming up

1017
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:42,980
It's funny because I thought we'd have a big slowdown with the holiday season, but our producers are there a crack team

1018
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:48,220
They're working on keeping content flowing and with all the news and thanks to folks like Todd for coming on

1019
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:51,900
We've got lots of good stuff to talk about. So I think it's gonna be a couple of good weeks of shows

1020
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:53,700
So don't go anywhere

1021
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:58,780
Even if you get the time off don't forget your Linux action show Linux unplugged shows will be here and you can join us live

1022
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:04,540
We do this show Tuesday 2 p.m. Pacific go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar to get that converted to your local time

1023
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:09,540
All right, Matt. Well, I'll see you on Sunday with the chinat with our chat with Lenart Pottering. All right, sounds good

1024
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:15,180
See that okay everybody. Thanks so much for tuning in this week's episode of Linux action show. Nope of Linux unplug

1025
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:45,140
I'll see you right back here next Tuesday

1026
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:58,540
Well, what show am I doing what day is it Linux action show I got too many what am I doing? Yeah

1027
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:08,860
No, it's pajamas there's pajamas I tell you all right, so go to JB titles calm go pick a title everybody go vote

1028
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:10,860
I got kind of

1029
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:16,060
To run together. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know what turns out pajama bottoms are way more

1030
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:20,860
Like they keep the heat in a lot more than jeans do so it is hot. It's hot

1031
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:23,420
Yeah, I've been wearing myself

1032
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:28,060
What I'm I'm I'm sat here in my pants Chris because it's so humid

1033
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:30,980
Yeah, remind me where you're at again

1034
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:35,460
Whimpy's on the road. I mean, I'm in Kuala Lumpur Kuala Lumpur

1035
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:38,940
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1036
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,140
Really?

1037
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:42,140
Well, that's a really good question

1038
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:46,660
I'd love to tell you all if you if you promise not to put it out in the in the show

1039
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:50,380
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna have to tell me later. Thanks. I'm still recording. Yeah, I don't want to get you in trouble

1040
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:55,920
Doesn't mind if it goes out on the live stream just don't put it in the in the edit

1041
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:56,260
All right

1042
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:56,420
Yeah

1043
01:19:56,420 --> 01:20:00,300
For you before you tell me I want to give a plug to something that I meant to mention in the show and then I'll turn

1044
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,580
Off the recording and you can tell it just to the live stream

1045
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:10,180
Um, so before we go, I want to give a plug and then we'll wrap up there is a QMU advent calendar

1046
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:13,300
And this is the best thing I've seen all year

1047
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:19,100
so every day they're doing a QMU virtual image pick and

1048
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:21,940
Today is day two

1049
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:24,700
So we're just at the beginning of it and it's modern dos

1050
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:30,320
The free dos disk image contains the latest and greatest from the land of the disk operating system besides checking out dos

1051
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,320
with a TCP IP stack

1052
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:40,260
He says you can relive id software's early shareware hit commander Keen as a bonus the free software edition of jetpack is also included

1053
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:46,480
For your crazy jet-powered platformer action. So QMU dash advent calendar org

1054
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:51,440
I'll have a link in the show notes day one was slackers time travel so you can go back and get the old ones

1055
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:55,280
This is what when you dig up the earliest slack or image to be had and you can go play around with it

1056
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:59,240
It ships with colonel zero dot nine nine dot twelve. Yeah, I said zero

1057
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,200
Dot nine nine dot twelve

1058
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:07,520
So it's not a great idea a QMU advent calendar. That's crazy. Yeah. Yeah, so all the Lincoln thing I've seen a week

1059
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,520
I just had a great experience

1060
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:14,840
Just a few minutes ago for the first time I needed to actually print from like my my desk workstation

1061
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:17,120
I have printing set up on the machines here in the studio like for notes

1062
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:21,560
But today I was up in my office and I realized I had cups installed

1063
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:26,480
but I didn't have like the PPD file for my brother laser printer and

1064
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:31,400
I bought it because I had read that it was a fairly well Linux supported laser printer

1065
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:38,360
And so I just did a packer search for for the model number of my brother printer

1066
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:44,840
And then the one result I got back was the PPD file for my exact brother printer

1067
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:49,360
I packer dash s that that file name that package name and within 30 seconds

1068
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:54,560
I had all of the cups printing set up for my my brother laser printer and I printed out the notes for today

1069
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,560
It was a pretty it was it felt a little it fell a little 2014 is all I'm saying

1070
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,400
It just felt like the future a little bit. Like that was the easiest printer setup I've ever had

1071
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,880
Yeah, there's lots of brother support in the AUR

1072
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:10,280
I think I maintain two of the brother printers there because I've got one at home and yeah what I've done

1073
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:18,680
AUR actually has the exact same printer drivers that you get from Ubuntu in terms of the extras

1074
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:26,680
Yeah, yeah, they're usually deb files that are then extracted and sprayed around them at the appropriate places

1075
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:31,280
And what I've done recently at home to avoid that whole printer driver

1076
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:37,960
Sort of arrangement is there's somebody's implemented the Google Cloud Print

1077
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,720
API and services that integrates with cups

1078
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:48,520
So I've got a Debbie and Weezy box that has got cups in so actually running open media vault

1079
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:52,120
And then put the cloud print API

1080
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:58,760
Into that and in order to get it to work, you actually have to put the printer drivers on the cup server

1081
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,240
so now that printer

1082
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:08,440
Advertises itself through the cloud print API for your Android phones and your Chromebooks. Not that I've got a Chromebook and the Chrome browser

1083
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:15,120
Oh, yeah. Yes, but it also makes publish it over multicast DNS on the LAN

1084
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:22,920
So you just get a Wi-Fi connection and that printer appears and you do to it without having to install anything on your machine

1085
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:25,760
So it works from like live ISOs and stuff like that

1086
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:31,280
That's really so you just you just set it up once on that dedicated box and you set it up once on that box

1087
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:37,160
And then it's available forever and always on everything. Hmm. Yeah, that Google Print thing is actually pretty handy

1088
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:40,720
I got to admit it is kind of nice. Yeah, it's a bit janky to set up

1089
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,720
But it works really well once you go through the steps

1090
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:46,080
Mm-hmm. I've been thinking about doing the exact same thing using my server

1091
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:49,700
Only thing is it's running open Sousa and it has been for several months now

1092
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:55,520
The problem with open Sousa is it's running an old version of cups that's incompatible with that framework the Google Print

1093
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,520
So I don't know. We're really which for you to open Sousa

1094
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:06,040
13.1. Okay, but it's like running 1.5 and they haven't updated it even in 13.2. Yeah, okay, huh?

1095
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:12,200
I so my experience was sort of it was just it was so hassle-free that I thought to myself

1096
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:18,600
I I'm pretty confident if you have the right conditions met and I think that's always a big if but I think if you have the

1097
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:22,800
Right conditions met setting up printers is a lot easier under Linux

1098
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,120
It isn't than it is under Windows

1099
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:27,240
Like if you guys I don't know when the last time you guys have set up a Windows printer

1100
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:32,440
but like you still have to go through this arcane wizard and it it still asks if you want to search a disk and

1101
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:37,000
Like all of this stuff that like you you would never expect a regular user to go through

1102
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:43,700
Every time even for eight HP printers, it's worse because you have to go and get a 600 megabyte

1103
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,280
executable and install

1104
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,720
boatloads of shit last time I bought a printer I

1105
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,240
Plot I unpacked it all

1106
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:57,720
Took the little strip off the printhead and plugged it into my laptop and sat it down put some paper in and then I went

1107
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:01,800
And sat at my desk and there was a little pop-up that said your printer is installed and ready to print

1108
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:05,040
And on Linux and this was like four years ago

1109
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:11,120
And I went to Amazon to review it because that's where I bought it from and I reviewed it and left a shining

1110
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:18,640
Review and every single other review was really terrible panning it not because of the printer but because of the Windows Drive. Yeah

1111
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,880
Yeah, I'm

1112
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:28,480
Because my my brother had like constantly kept asking me like you fixed this printer stuff

1113
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:32,440
And there's a ton of issues with his Windows thing and I shut up my laptop

1114
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:36,240
I plugged it in added it to my thing. It took like 20 seconds

1115
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:41,160
I showed him his already connected. He's like, okay, give me that. Yeah, and now he's been using it for a couple months

1116
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:44,400
Yeah, that's the thing about cups. This is just amazing. Yeah

1117
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:45,040
Yeah

1118
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:51,480
When I when I when I started using cups that to have all of your printers manageable through a web interface was groundbreaking from a tech

1119
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,760
Support standpoint just totally groundbreaking not having to remote desktop into a Windows box

1120
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:01,280
And then and go into the print queue and by the way if the Windows box and this is still the same today if the Windows

1121
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,280
Box is struggling with a print job for some reason

1122
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:08,680
Sometimes like the the spooler is just totally non-responsive like you can't go in there and delete documents

1123
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,560
It is so out of the 80s

1124
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:14,940
It's it's almost like you go into a time machine when you manage print jobs in Windows and like, you know

1125
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:20,800
I became proficient at net stop quote print spooler at close quote enter net start

1126
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,880
You know to restart the spooler service because it constantly crashes under

1127
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:26,400
Windows and I'm talking in high load right for home printing

1128
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,200
it's probably not so bad but I just

1129
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:34,200
When cups came along and I could I could actually manage a failing print job and I could view all of the printers in one

1130
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:37,180
Window in one screen. Oh, it was so powerful

1131
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,400
So and then you know here I am

1132
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:45,320
You know thinking this is gonna be way overkill for just a home printer setup because honestly my experience with cups is multi hundred

1133
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,760
Printers, it's not one printer. So I'm thinking to myself

1134
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:52,360
No, here I go. I gotta go. This is this is the problem with arch

1135
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:56,160
I gotta go install cups and I'm gonna spend 15 minutes configuring it

1136
01:26:56,160 --> 01:27:00,400
And then I got to figure out to get my printer to work and I'm just going through this whole list and then it

1137
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,760
Ended up being like a 30-second process and I just that back good cups is amazing

1138
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:09,160
It starts it works for one printer all the way up to hundreds of printers and it's got awesome things about it in the whole

1139
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:24,160
Range, it's a really powerful printing system
