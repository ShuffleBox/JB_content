00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
I decided the whole trip I would avoid eating fish,

00:03.120 --> 00:04.720
because why eat fish when you're away

00:04.720 --> 00:06.280
from the Pacific Northwest, right?

00:06.280 --> 00:08.860
So guess what I've been eating since I've been back?

00:08.860 --> 00:10.560
Pretty much nothing but fish.

00:10.560 --> 00:13.520
Yeah, but I will say the fish we did have impromptu

00:13.520 --> 00:15.680
in the parking lot was pretty amazing.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.720
Parking lot fish, not sketchy at all.

00:17.720 --> 00:18.880
Let's be clear, too.

00:18.880 --> 00:22.320
Poe Dunk gas station parking lot in Jerome, Idaho.

00:22.320 --> 00:23.800
And it was amazing.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.320
We made the best of that situation.

00:26.320 --> 00:37.640
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:37.640 --> 00:38.520
My name is Chris.

00:38.520 --> 00:39.600
My name is Wes.

00:39.600 --> 00:40.600
And my name is Brent.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.040
Hello, gentlemen.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.960
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru,

00:43.960 --> 00:45.200
the leader in learning for the Cloud,

00:45.200 --> 00:46.240
Linux, and other modern tech skills.

00:46.240 --> 00:49.680
Right now, everyone can get cloud learning for a discount.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.180
That's right, hundreds of courses,

00:51.180 --> 00:55.000
thousands of hands-on labs, free cloud sandboxes, all more

00:55.000 --> 00:56.880
at cloudguru.com.

00:56.880 --> 00:58.280
Well, coming up on the show today,

00:58.280 --> 01:00.440
we're mixing our vanilla with our chocolate,

01:00.440 --> 01:03.080
like one of those tasty cones that I never actually get.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.720
But then when my kids order them, I look at them

01:04.720 --> 01:06.560
and think, I should have got one of those.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.060
We're going to start out with some really important desktop

01:09.060 --> 01:10.480
developments this week.

01:10.480 --> 01:13.840
And then we'll wrap up that with a conversation

01:13.840 --> 01:17.480
around some new features landing in Matrix, where we think

01:17.480 --> 01:20.480
Matrix is going, and some changes and improvements

01:20.480 --> 01:22.720
we're making to both our Matrix community

01:22.720 --> 01:25.240
and the actual Matrix server itself.

01:25.240 --> 01:27.560
So there's a lot there that we're going to get into.

01:27.560 --> 01:30.520
But before we do that, before we do the community news,

01:30.520 --> 01:32.160
any of that kind of stuff, we have

01:32.160 --> 01:33.560
to say time-appropriate greetings

01:33.560 --> 01:34.520
to our virtual lug.

01:34.520 --> 01:35.760
Hello, Mumble Room.

01:35.760 --> 01:36.840
Namaskaram.

01:36.840 --> 01:37.880
Hello.

01:37.880 --> 01:38.400
Hello.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.560
Hello.

01:39.560 --> 01:40.560
Hello.

01:40.560 --> 01:41.760
Hello, everybody.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.360
Man, is it nice to be back in the studio

01:43.360 --> 01:46.360
and nice to actually see your faces.

01:46.360 --> 01:49.500
I'll talk more about that in a bit, but yes, I am back.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.360
It is good.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.480
We did get the server up.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.160
We have a complete update next week

01:54.160 --> 01:56.680
in Linux Unplugged on what was wrong with our server,

01:56.680 --> 01:59.160
the fact that it crashed again, and what we did to fix that,

01:59.160 --> 02:00.560
and what our long-term plans are.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.240
But before we can get to that, we actually just

02:03.240 --> 02:06.320
have to take care of some business.

02:06.320 --> 02:06.840
That's right.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.320
It's time to do a server update, Wes.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.320
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?

02:14.320 --> 02:17.120
Because it's been a long, long time since we

02:17.120 --> 02:18.320
did an Arch server update.

02:18.320 --> 02:21.640
Yeah, that's why we have 187 packages

02:21.640 --> 02:24.120
to download and update, including

02:24.120 --> 02:25.520
a new version of the kernel.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.320
And that's not even accounting for the fact

02:27.320 --> 02:30.080
that there's a new ZFS version in the AUR as well.

02:30.080 --> 02:30.920
What could go wrong?

02:30.920 --> 02:34.360
It's just our kernel and our file system of choice.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.560
We do these Arch updates, so you don't have to, though.

02:36.560 --> 02:37.760
We'll do them.

02:37.760 --> 02:41.480
And you know, I mean, we will be using almost 300 megs less

02:41.480 --> 02:42.760
disk space if we succeed.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.440
So there's a small benefit there, too.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.200
That's how you know it's a good Arch update.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.600
You install it, and it actually ends up using less disk space.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.280
So all right, Wes, here's what we're going to do.

02:51.280 --> 02:52.800
You get those packages downloading,

02:52.800 --> 02:54.240
because it's going to take a while to download, like,

02:54.240 --> 02:56.240
nearly 700 megs worth of packages.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.520
And then we will check back in the post-show

02:58.520 --> 03:01.040
and do the final install and see how everything goes.

03:01.040 --> 03:01.800
All right?

03:01.800 --> 03:02.520
That's the plan.

03:02.520 --> 03:04.040
Wish me luck, everyone.

03:04.040 --> 03:12.040
But first, we do have some community news.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.360
Josh Strobel joins us.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.280
It's been forever, Josh, since you've been on the show.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.040
And we love having you here, because I

03:17.040 --> 03:20.000
love getting updates on Solus, your baby,

03:20.000 --> 03:21.720
and what's going on there.

03:21.720 --> 03:25.000
And you drew a lot of attention this last week

03:25.000 --> 03:27.160
when you published a post, quote,

03:27.160 --> 03:29.720
building an alternative ecosystem,

03:29.720 --> 03:31.280
where you called out some problems

03:31.280 --> 03:33.840
that you feel like you're having in the downstream position

03:33.840 --> 03:34.720
with GNOME.

03:34.720 --> 03:36.520
And Josh, I want to thank you for coming on

03:36.520 --> 03:38.680
and giving voice to this, because other distribution

03:38.680 --> 03:40.600
makers are having some frustrations right now,

03:40.600 --> 03:41.440
it seems.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.440
And unlike what we typically have where users get upset,

03:44.440 --> 03:46.640
in this case, it seems like the people

03:46.640 --> 03:49.000
who make our distributions are starting to get upset.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.120
So can you explain what's going on for people who

03:51.120 --> 03:52.600
are totally new to this topic?

03:52.600 --> 03:54.600
Yeah, well, first off, thank you for having me on.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.320
I really appreciate having the opportunity

03:57.320 --> 04:02.160
to actually discuss quite a controversial post I certainly

04:02.160 --> 04:04.800
made, not without some of its faults.

04:04.800 --> 04:08.600
But in essence, the concerns I raised

04:08.600 --> 04:12.040
are kind of two pronged in my building alternative ecosystem

04:12.040 --> 04:13.080
blog post.

04:13.080 --> 04:16.720
So the first one is about kind of the GNOME community

04:16.720 --> 04:19.440
and some of the behavior and attitude

04:19.440 --> 04:22.200
exhibited by GNOME developers, whether they're

04:22.200 --> 04:24.280
GDK developers or otherwise.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.320
And we've seen some of this before

04:26.320 --> 04:29.640
with Tobias' controversial post that he

04:29.640 --> 04:32.280
made about traditional desktops being dead

04:32.280 --> 04:35.720
and that kind of thing, but also just some of the behavior

04:35.720 --> 04:39.480
that they've exhibited fairly recently in response

04:39.480 --> 04:42.240
to some concerns actually originally raised

04:42.240 --> 04:46.760
by the System76 developer Jeremy, who, as we all know,

04:46.760 --> 04:50.160
works on the Cosmic slash Pop OS desktop environments

04:50.160 --> 04:51.200
and all that.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.400
So we have some of that, but also there's

04:53.400 --> 04:55.400
some concerns that we have related

04:55.400 --> 04:58.920
to the fragmentation of how theming

04:58.920 --> 05:04.240
is going to be working going forward in GNOME 42 and GDK5

05:04.240 --> 05:06.880
and how that's going to look and play out

05:06.880 --> 05:10.480
across a variety of GDK-based desktop environments,

05:10.480 --> 05:13.880
applications, across different operating systems

05:13.880 --> 05:17.800
like elementary and Pop OS and Solus and Ferran OS

05:17.800 --> 05:19.400
and so on and so forth.

05:19.400 --> 05:23.640
So I wrote a big blog post on my personal website kind

05:23.640 --> 05:29.800
of detailing these concerns about their changing of how

05:29.800 --> 05:33.520
dark theme is going to work and shifting that to libidwaita

05:33.520 --> 05:36.680
and removing some of the APIs and key values

05:36.680 --> 05:42.040
that we need as downstreams in GDK5 with the assumption

05:42.040 --> 05:44.600
that we're all going to be building these platform

05:44.600 --> 05:47.800
libraries to handle our styling and all that differently.

05:47.800 --> 05:52.520
And so the transition is essentially distribution makers

05:52.520 --> 05:56.480
who are downstream clients of GNOME.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.960
They like to brand the desktop environment currently,

05:58.960 --> 06:01.640
if I understand this correctly, by essentially modifying

06:01.640 --> 06:04.840
the CSS around the GNOME, either Adwadi itself

06:04.840 --> 06:07.560
or a different theme, and they can kind of color things

06:07.560 --> 06:08.880
and brand things that way.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.080
And that's going away.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.560
And any customization that will be allowed

06:12.560 --> 06:16.560
is going to be via libidwaita, starting with GNOME 42.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.240
And in there, it's going to be more things

06:18.240 --> 06:20.440
like accent colors that can be tweaked and stuff.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.160
Is that a correct assessment?

06:22.160 --> 06:26.800
Right now, what we have is a key value called GDK-Theme,

06:26.800 --> 06:30.840
where what you can do is say, I want platidark or platinoir

06:30.840 --> 06:34.240
or I want materia dark or that sort of theme.

06:34.240 --> 06:38.920
And that is used and respected by GDK and across all those GDK

06:38.920 --> 06:40.440
applications.

06:40.440 --> 06:41.960
So that's what we have at the moment.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.520
What we're going to be having going forward

06:44.520 --> 06:46.920
is a situation where libidwaita will

06:46.920 --> 06:51.120
have a recoloring API, which will be for application

06:51.120 --> 06:53.400
developers, but not end users.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.680
So this will be up to application developers

06:56.680 --> 07:00.280
to expose its recoloring functionality to end users

07:00.280 --> 07:01.080
if they want.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.040
Of course, we understand that there's

07:03.040 --> 07:07.440
some individuals that have cosigned to the don't theme

07:07.440 --> 07:11.880
my app that might have a different view on application

07:11.880 --> 07:12.920
theming.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.720
However, effectively, what we're going to have to do

07:15.720 --> 07:20.800
if you want to have theming with a GDK application

07:20.800 --> 07:23.200
is you would have to build out your own library that

07:23.200 --> 07:26.240
handles the loading of a specific style sheet.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.840
So in libidwaita's case, it's edwaita,

07:28.840 --> 07:30.880
which is edwaita-light or edwaita-dark.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.840
For elementary, it would be with their libgranite.

07:33.840 --> 07:36.160
And effectively, what GNOME is saying

07:36.160 --> 07:38.400
is, OK, Sol is system 76.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.560
You guys have to develop your own thing.

07:40.560 --> 07:44.280
And now, when you ship applications that are, say,

07:44.280 --> 07:47.000
based on their core GNOME applications,

07:47.000 --> 07:48.960
but you also ship your own, you run

07:48.960 --> 07:51.720
the risk of those looking different, functioning

07:51.720 --> 07:54.920
different, depending on if you implement their dark theme

07:54.920 --> 07:57.800
standard that's been proposed and all of that.

07:57.800 --> 08:00.320
So it ends up being a real mess compared

08:00.320 --> 08:03.480
to the current situation, which is you change a single key,

08:03.480 --> 08:05.840
and it applies universally across all your GNOME

08:05.840 --> 08:07.360
applications.

08:07.360 --> 08:09.800
Josh, it seems like a barrier here

08:09.800 --> 08:13.680
is I think the GNOME camp would argue what we have today

08:13.680 --> 08:16.480
is a mess, and that something like libidwaita

08:16.480 --> 08:19.880
is designed to solve that and give developers more control

08:19.880 --> 08:21.760
over how their applications look.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.160
Do you grant that some of that's true?

08:24.160 --> 08:26.600
I can see that side of the argument there.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.400
Yeah, I mean, I certainly understand their perspective

08:29.400 --> 08:33.280
of there might be situations where you apply a theme,

08:33.280 --> 08:35.560
and that theme unexpectedly breaks

08:35.560 --> 08:38.960
the layout and styling of a GNOME application.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.640
And obviously, their concern is trying

08:40.640 --> 08:43.120
to ensure that doesn't happen.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.640
But I feel like most of that ends up coming down

08:45.640 --> 08:49.080
to fixing the theme, not necessarily preventing

08:49.080 --> 08:52.560
the end user from making those changes to begin with.

08:52.560 --> 08:55.980
So I feel like it's a difference in perspective.

08:55.980 --> 08:58.960
And my perspective is coming from the whole idea

08:58.960 --> 09:02.280
of the ability under Linux to be able to make

09:02.280 --> 09:06.240
all these sort of customizations that you want

09:06.240 --> 09:10.440
is kind of being taken away or shoved or made harder

09:10.440 --> 09:11.840
versus their perspective.

09:11.840 --> 09:15.080
So it's a very interesting problem.

09:15.080 --> 09:15.640
It is.

09:15.640 --> 09:20.920
And it seems like the conversation has soured a bit.

09:20.920 --> 09:23.040
It seems like maybe some personality conflicts

09:23.040 --> 09:25.800
are involved, and it kind of has shut down.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.640
And it seems like their intended path going forward

09:28.640 --> 09:33.380
is Libidwadia, which they plan to have 1.0 in GNOME 42.

09:33.380 --> 09:35.880
They think that they'll have some recoloring functionality

09:35.880 --> 09:36.380
in there.

09:36.380 --> 09:39.240
Proper dark style settings will be available by then.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.600
But system-wide accent colors and that kind of stuff

09:41.600 --> 09:43.220
probably not going to land by then.

09:43.220 --> 09:45.680
And there definitely won't be any kind of theming API.

09:45.680 --> 09:46.600
That's correct, yeah.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.260
And I think their contention is, well,

09:48.260 --> 09:49.720
if you want a theming API, build it.

09:49.720 --> 09:50.880
Do you think that would actually work?

09:50.880 --> 09:53.340
Could you show up with some code and say, OK, here you go,

09:53.340 --> 09:53.840
GNOME.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.440
We've created a theming API.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.560
Do you think they'd actually accept it?

09:57.560 --> 09:58.880
I'm not entirely sure they would,

09:58.880 --> 10:00.960
because if you look at even some of the work

10:00.960 --> 10:03.640
that Matthias has tried doing, and Matthias

10:03.640 --> 10:06.680
is one of the GDK developers, with some of the theming

10:06.680 --> 10:11.660
even in GDK 4, the end decision was to actually punt that over

10:11.660 --> 10:14.840
to Libidwadia, because there is this constant conflict

10:14.840 --> 10:19.160
between GDK developers, GDK application developers,

10:19.160 --> 10:21.400
distributions, end users.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.400
There doesn't seem to be a good middle ground

10:23.400 --> 10:25.440
at the moment between all of this.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.880
So it seems like the path, instead

10:27.880 --> 10:29.360
of trying to find a middle ground,

10:29.360 --> 10:31.360
has been to just fracture things.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.160
And it seems like for Solus, it doesn't

10:33.160 --> 10:36.960
look like this is a direction that you all want to go into.

10:36.960 --> 10:39.920
And so you're looking at utilizing the Enlightenment

10:39.920 --> 10:41.600
libraries for future development.

10:41.600 --> 10:47.800
Yeah, so to just clarify, I made a statement regarding Qt.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.040
So basically, I laid out all of our alternatives,

10:50.040 --> 10:52.880
which were like EFL, which is Enlightenment,

10:52.880 --> 10:56.080
Foundation libraries, Qt, and Iced.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.760
I had stated that there is a commercial licensing related

10:59.760 --> 11:03.400
to Qt. I want to clarify that the issues that we have

11:03.400 --> 11:07.680
in relation to Qt and the KDE project and all of that

11:07.680 --> 11:09.880
is related to the fact that we don't

11:09.880 --> 11:11.960
want to have to be put into a position where we're

11:11.960 --> 11:14.200
maintaining a patch set, like KDE

11:14.200 --> 11:18.080
has to do with the 5.15 series, with all

11:18.080 --> 11:21.680
the comprehensive libraries that Qt provides.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.640
So we would rather just avoid that path

11:23.640 --> 11:27.680
entirely and not have to be concerned with Qt's

11:27.680 --> 11:30.120
commercialization of Qt.

11:30.120 --> 11:33.120
So that basically brings us to EFL and Iced.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.480
So for those that aren't familiar,

11:34.480 --> 11:38.440
Iced is a toolkit that is designed for Rust.

11:38.440 --> 11:43.120
So obviously, that's been a point of contention internally

11:43.120 --> 11:45.080
because some of us like Rust, some of us

11:45.080 --> 11:46.880
prefer C and all that.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.600
But at the end of the day, that's just not quite ready

11:49.600 --> 11:52.600
because it misses some of the APIs that we would need,

11:52.600 --> 11:55.720
like layering to build basic stuff like pop-ups.

11:55.720 --> 11:58.480
So what that means is basically EFL is there.

11:58.480 --> 12:01.240
As effectively, the only option we really

12:01.240 --> 12:03.880
have aside from building our own toolkit, which just

12:03.880 --> 12:07.440
isn't sustainable, I mean, we've been kicking Budgie 11

12:07.440 --> 12:09.680
down the curb and waiting for GDK4

12:09.680 --> 12:12.320
being a state where it was released as stable,

12:12.320 --> 12:15.040
not to mention in a state that we're happy with.

12:15.040 --> 12:18.280
So it's just we got to pull the trigger and just go with EFL

12:18.280 --> 12:22.040
and start working on Solace applications and Budgie 11

12:22.040 --> 12:23.120
in EFL.

12:23.120 --> 12:23.840
Wow.

12:23.840 --> 12:24.960
That seems like a huge job.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.440
But in a way, I'm kind of glad you're doing it

12:27.440 --> 12:30.560
because Solace has always really been great at kind of doing

12:30.560 --> 12:32.480
some research and development in an area

12:32.480 --> 12:35.360
that maybe other distributions aren't looking at and landing

12:35.360 --> 12:36.240
on something clever.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.600
So I think in a way, it's going to work out pretty well

12:38.600 --> 12:42.360
because it takes some pressure off the GNOME project as well.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.320
They can kind of do their thing.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.240
And you guys can do your thing.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.720
And maybe if it starts to look like a direction people

12:48.720 --> 12:50.760
are interested in, some other projects will jump in with you.

12:50.760 --> 12:53.200
Have you gotten any bites on other people

12:53.200 --> 12:54.560
joining you in this effort?

12:54.560 --> 12:57.720
I haven't had anybody from like System76 reach out directly.

12:57.720 --> 13:00.240
Maybe they would wait until I write the Rust bindings

13:00.240 --> 13:01.800
for EFL, which is something I want

13:01.800 --> 13:04.840
to do to make it more approachable to more people.

13:04.840 --> 13:08.000
However, I've had some EFL developers reach out actually

13:08.000 --> 13:11.200
and ask what they could do to actually help

13:11.200 --> 13:13.880
or what ways they could get involved

13:13.880 --> 13:17.000
in bringing EFL-based applications to Solace.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.720
So I've been extremely pleased with the reception

13:21.720 --> 13:24.560
that the EFL community has had related to that.

13:24.560 --> 13:27.000
And we already have people in the Solace community

13:27.000 --> 13:29.040
that are application developers that are already

13:29.040 --> 13:31.320
looking towards building applications.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.680
Like for instance, Sarabit, he's the developer

13:33.680 --> 13:36.320
of an application called Wraith Master, which

13:36.320 --> 13:39.880
does RGB controls for your Wraith Spire

13:39.880 --> 13:41.040
coolers and all that.

13:41.040 --> 13:43.400
He's working on an EFL implementation as well.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.600
So that's good to hear.

13:44.600 --> 13:45.840
That's really good to hear.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.080
This feels almost like an impossible problem

13:48.080 --> 13:50.200
to solve to everyone's satisfaction.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.160
Reading through the GNOME camp's position,

13:53.160 --> 13:54.920
it seems very much like they're of the opinion

13:54.920 --> 13:57.080
like they have a few things they want to accomplish,

13:57.080 --> 13:59.200
like say, dark mode and high contrast

13:59.200 --> 14:01.280
mode for accessibility.

14:01.280 --> 14:04.040
And to do that, they have to make some fundamental changes.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.800
And they kind of have some other problems

14:05.800 --> 14:06.840
to solve at the same time.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.720
And so this seems like the direction they're going to go.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.800
Is Libidwadia, that's where the customization is going to be.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.040
If you want to customize, you're going

14:14.040 --> 14:14.960
to have to modify that.

14:14.960 --> 14:17.080
And application developers are going

14:17.080 --> 14:19.840
to have some say now if their application can

14:19.840 --> 14:21.040
be themed or not.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.560
This is not just a problem unique to GNOME.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.280
And so, Neil, could you give us some insights

14:25.280 --> 14:28.280
into how the Plasma Desktop struggles with this?

14:28.280 --> 14:30.320
The Plasma Desktop, as most people know,

14:30.320 --> 14:32.480
uses the Qt toolkit underneath.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.240
I mean, Josh mentioned it briefly earlier

14:35.240 --> 14:38.160
that we depend on Qt from the Qt company.

14:38.160 --> 14:41.360
And there's been kerfuffles about it.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.520
It hasn't been a huge deal that KDE

14:43.520 --> 14:45.800
is maintaining a patch set on top of Qt 5.15

14:45.800 --> 14:47.920
because they're all backports of things

14:47.920 --> 14:49.840
that they send up to Qt 6.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.920
And the goal is to move to Qt 6 anyway.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.720
And Qt 6 doesn't have the same impairment

14:53.720 --> 14:55.960
that Qt 5.15 has right now.

14:55.960 --> 15:00.000
But to get to the heart of the matter with GTK and GNOME

15:00.000 --> 15:02.120
and their decision with Libidwadia,

15:02.120 --> 15:06.040
the problem with Libidwadia is if you run an application that

15:06.040 --> 15:10.560
forces Adwadia on Plasma, it is entirely alien in convention,

15:10.560 --> 15:15.560
in style, in arrangement, in accessibility, in theming,

15:15.760 --> 15:18.520
in UX patterns, the whole works.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.840
Plasma historically has bent over backwards

15:20.840 --> 15:24.520
to incorporate GNOME and GTK applications into the fold.

15:24.520 --> 15:27.720
Like there are adapters and drivers and style sheets

15:27.720 --> 15:30.520
and configuration and overrides and all kinds of things

15:30.520 --> 15:35.520
that we do to make it so that a GTK GNOME application

15:35.520 --> 15:40.520
actually fits in Plasma with what GNOME is doing here.

15:41.160 --> 15:46.160
They've basically said, we don't think that having

15:46.200 --> 15:49.680
an application fit within the environment

15:49.680 --> 15:53.080
that the user is working in is a valuable property.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.960
What I suspect is actually gonna happen mid to long term

15:56.960 --> 16:01.960
is that as Libidwadia stabilizes its ABI,

16:02.040 --> 16:04.160
when the 1.0 release, the ABI and API

16:04.160 --> 16:07.920
will be mostly stable, it'll get forked.

16:07.920 --> 16:10.520
And that library will get forked into a drop-in replacement

16:10.520 --> 16:12.760
that will revert to the old behavior

16:12.760 --> 16:14.960
of allowing the system themes to propagate through

16:14.960 --> 16:16.200
to all the applications.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.440
That's exactly what I expect will happen too.

16:18.440 --> 16:19.600
Yeah, I mean, that's been something

16:19.600 --> 16:22.160
that we've been considering internally for Souls as well.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.780
We provide a lot of patches on top of these applications

16:24.780 --> 16:27.200
to revert some of the behavior that GNOME does.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.120
And unfortunately, it might be the case

16:29.120 --> 16:31.640
where we have to do that for Libidwadia as well.

16:31.640 --> 16:32.880
Is it Adwaita or Adwadia?

16:32.880 --> 16:33.720
I don't know.

16:33.720 --> 16:34.560
I don't know.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.000
I mean, is it GNOME or is it GNOME, right?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.320
You two don't know.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.160
Who does?

16:40.160 --> 16:41.760
Well, so I've been calling it Adwaita

16:41.760 --> 16:44.240
until Chris started calling it Adwadia today.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.200
And I was like, all right.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.760
I do both to cover my bases.

16:46.760 --> 16:47.800
Okay. Yeah.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.520
For Libidwadia, I fully expect that we'll see something

16:50.520 --> 16:53.340
like lib system theme or something like that.

16:53.340 --> 16:56.080
And it'll produce a dummy library of Libidwadia

16:56.080 --> 17:00.440
and lib granite and bind those APIs back in

17:00.440 --> 17:03.720
into something that any desktop can plug into.

17:03.720 --> 17:06.240
And it may be something that's a joint effort

17:06.240 --> 17:08.360
across the different alternative desktops

17:08.360 --> 17:12.000
that basically don't fit with what GNOME is doing now.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
So like Matei.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.480
But might that ultimately not be a better solution?

17:16.480 --> 17:18.060
No, no, no, no, no.

17:18.060 --> 17:19.500
So a lot of people don't know this,

17:19.500 --> 17:22.120
but this is actually how everything worked with GTK2.

17:22.120 --> 17:25.240
So in GTK2 land, to kind of recap,

17:25.240 --> 17:27.000
you had a concept of a theming engine

17:27.000 --> 17:28.040
and you plugged that in,

17:28.040 --> 17:30.320
and then it would propagate back into the applications.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.620
And do all the things.

17:32.620 --> 17:35.120
The problem with this model

17:35.120 --> 17:39.400
was that you were essentially required

17:39.400 --> 17:42.880
to make sure you were binding on both sides correctly

17:42.880 --> 17:43.700
the whole time.

17:43.700 --> 17:46.680
So every time a new release of the platform,

17:46.680 --> 17:51.000
GTK2, libgnome, desktop, all the other things around it,

17:51.000 --> 17:55.020
that linked into GTK and like used it to render stuff,

17:55.020 --> 17:56.680
you needed to make sure you covered

17:56.680 --> 17:58.520
all the widgets and stuff.

17:58.520 --> 18:02.400
And one of the reasons GTK3 doesn't have this

18:02.400 --> 18:05.280
was that the idea was if we went to style sheets,

18:05.280 --> 18:09.660
CSS, JavaScript with GJS, and use that instead,

18:09.660 --> 18:11.600
we'd get to a world where we would be able

18:11.600 --> 18:13.680
to do a declarative simple model.

18:13.680 --> 18:14.860
I mean, it's not really declarative.

18:14.860 --> 18:15.880
CSS is Turing complete.

18:15.880 --> 18:18.280
But declarative simple model

18:18.280 --> 18:22.880
of being able to easily implement

18:22.880 --> 18:26.880
styling of applications in a way that is clear,

18:26.880 --> 18:30.720
testable, and usable, and portable.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.280
And they immediately ripped out

18:32.280 --> 18:35.560
the three theming engine stuff in GTK3

18:35.560 --> 18:37.820
when they finished implementing the style sheet stuff.

18:37.820 --> 18:40.860
So in GTK4, we're getting the worst of all worlds.

18:40.860 --> 18:44.160
We're getting the theming engine plus the CSS style sheet.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.960
Nobody actually likes working with CSS,

18:46.960 --> 18:49.880
but the upshot of the CSS stuff with GTK3

18:49.880 --> 18:50.960
was that you didn't have to write

18:50.960 --> 18:53.080
a whole bloody theming engine to work with it.

18:53.080 --> 18:53.920
You were able to use-

18:53.920 --> 18:57.840
Democratize the customization of GTK-based applications.

18:57.840 --> 18:58.680
Exactly.

18:58.680 --> 19:03.680
And if you look at Breeze GTK2 and Breeze GTK3,

19:03.880 --> 19:08.640
Breeze GTK2 is horrible compared to Breeze GTK3

19:08.640 --> 19:12.400
because Breeze GTK3 looks like Breeze on Qt

19:12.400 --> 19:15.960
because both Qt5 and GTK3 operate

19:15.960 --> 19:19.720
on the same basic principles on how they do styling.

19:19.720 --> 19:23.560
So with GTK4, we now go back to having theming engines

19:23.560 --> 19:25.760
and we have the style sheets.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.920
And so now we're in the worst of all worlds.

19:27.920 --> 19:30.960
You know, it's not great to hear that,

19:30.960 --> 19:32.980
but I can still sort of see

19:32.980 --> 19:34.280
why they're going this direction.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.100
And I understand that it's frustrating.

19:36.100 --> 19:38.140
And I think it's disappointing how the conversation

19:38.140 --> 19:40.700
has devolved into kind of personality conflicts,

19:40.700 --> 19:42.800
essentially just kind of preventing

19:42.800 --> 19:45.480
proper organization on this.

19:45.480 --> 19:48.980
But what fascinates me about this conversation

19:48.980 --> 19:51.220
is it hasn't hit end users yet.

19:51.220 --> 19:54.400
They'll notice this with GNOME 42,

19:54.400 --> 19:57.540
but right now it's distro makers

19:57.540 --> 19:59.600
and desktop environment developers

19:59.600 --> 20:02.200
who are raising a red flag.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.360
It's one of these problems that's bubbling

20:04.360 --> 20:06.040
in the development community

20:06.040 --> 20:08.200
and it's created some turf wars there,

20:08.200 --> 20:10.860
but it actually hasn't really hit end users yet,

20:10.860 --> 20:11.700
but it's coming.

20:11.700 --> 20:12.920
Yeah, I mean, in the case of Solus,

20:12.920 --> 20:15.120
it's why we're actually going to be moving

20:15.120 --> 20:17.360
our default applications that ship

20:17.360 --> 20:20.240
to not leverage ones that we anticipate

20:20.240 --> 20:22.040
are going to be using Libidoida.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.800
So that way, obviously it's not going to affect

20:24.800 --> 20:26.680
those that already have Solus installed,

20:26.680 --> 20:28.800
but those that will have Solus installed

20:28.800 --> 20:32.220
or intend on installing it or have a fresh installation,

20:32.220 --> 20:34.240
when GNOME 42 finally rolls out,

20:34.240 --> 20:36.520
they're not gonna really notice any difference.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.080
Or at least that's the end goal.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.220
Hopefully, right?

20:39.220 --> 20:40.160
Yeah, well said.

20:40.160 --> 20:43.340
I think it's tricky because GNOME sees themselves

20:43.340 --> 20:46.740
as creating a platform that is consumed by end users,

20:46.740 --> 20:47.760
by actual users.

20:47.760 --> 20:49.160
And that's why when they do surveys,

20:49.160 --> 20:51.280
they go out and they find commercial operating system users

20:51.280 --> 20:52.540
and they survey how they use them

20:52.540 --> 20:55.920
and use that to inform future decisions or whatever.

20:55.920 --> 20:59.860
But there is a very common use case of GNOME

20:59.860 --> 21:02.280
that is, I don't think in that conception of theirs,

21:02.280 --> 21:04.260
in my opinion, I don't know for sure,

21:04.260 --> 21:06.320
but in that is the downstream distro makers.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.140
I don't think GNOME really thinks of themselves

21:08.140 --> 21:10.360
as an upstream vendor that is producing code

21:10.360 --> 21:13.200
for downstream consumers who are then repackaging it

21:13.200 --> 21:14.820
for their end users,

21:14.820 --> 21:16.760
where shipping it with an extension enabled,

21:16.760 --> 21:19.280
even if it's Fedora, is commonplace.

21:19.280 --> 21:21.960
And shipping it with a theme applied is commonplace.

21:21.960 --> 21:23.840
Like these are very common things.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.800
Fedora does the least amount of tweaks,

21:25.800 --> 21:28.500
but even Fedora has a little logo extension

21:28.500 --> 21:29.520
they ship with.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.180
So literally every downstream vendor of GNOME

21:32.180 --> 21:33.440
is using extensions,

21:33.440 --> 21:34.520
but yet the project says,

21:34.520 --> 21:36.840
eh, extensions are niche, nobody uses them.

21:36.840 --> 21:37.980
Because they're thinking about it

21:37.980 --> 21:39.680
from people who are consuming the product

21:39.680 --> 21:40.720
they create directly.

21:40.720 --> 21:41.560
Yeah.

21:41.560 --> 21:42.920
Which I can tell you really isn't the case

21:42.920 --> 21:45.480
because even like for Solus GNOME edition,

21:45.480 --> 21:47.680
historically we shipped with Dash to Dock.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.280
Obviously, you know, there's been some issues

21:50.280 --> 21:52.120
with getting that moved over to GNOME 40

21:52.120 --> 21:53.480
to the point where they've been like,

21:53.480 --> 21:55.640
eh, we're just gonna wait until 41 is out

21:55.640 --> 21:57.220
before we even really bother

21:57.220 --> 21:58.960
with releasing a new version of it.

21:58.960 --> 22:02.320
Where like people actually use stuff like Dash to Dock

22:02.320 --> 22:03.720
or Dash to Panel.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.480
Like if you check screenshots,

22:05.480 --> 22:07.180
most of the time of GNOME,

22:07.180 --> 22:08.960
they're not using the default UI.

22:08.960 --> 22:12.060
They are extended up the wazoo

22:12.060 --> 22:14.100
with like system trays,

22:14.100 --> 22:16.760
with impatience to reduce animation speeds

22:16.760 --> 22:18.760
with Dash to Dock or Dash to Panel

22:18.760 --> 22:20.760
with like app menu stuff.

22:20.760 --> 22:24.040
And this whole idea that their niche

22:24.040 --> 22:26.740
is just a fundamental disconnect

22:26.740 --> 22:30.280
between the GNOME shell and GNOME developers

22:30.280 --> 22:31.840
and their end users, I think.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.700
Well, and another aspect of this is that,

22:33.700 --> 22:35.920
so Chris, you mentioned that Fedora ships an extension

22:35.920 --> 22:38.720
for the, you know, the watermark at the bottom right.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.680
The reason why we do that is because GNOME

22:40.680 --> 22:43.080
refuses to implement distro branding anywhere.

22:43.080 --> 22:45.800
There's actually no support for distro branding

22:45.800 --> 22:50.160
in the entire source tree of the entire desktop.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.000
Yep.

22:51.000 --> 22:51.840
You can't do it.

22:51.840 --> 22:52.880
So you have to patch it.

22:52.880 --> 22:54.800
Like we have a patch for GDM.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.640
We have an override to offer an extension on GNOME shell.

22:57.640 --> 23:00.040
We have to compile in extra logic

23:00.040 --> 23:02.120
into GNOME initial setup.

23:02.120 --> 23:04.800
We have to patch in the GNOME settings panel

23:04.800 --> 23:06.520
or GNOME control center is what it's called.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.960
Yeah, so it just has to do that too, just for a logo.

23:08.960 --> 23:11.080
Yeah, it's just so that it will pick a logo

23:11.080 --> 23:12.600
and do the right thing there.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.400
Like the way I would describe it

23:14.400 --> 23:19.400
is that GNOME considers themselves the project

23:19.400 --> 23:22.200
that delivers the experience to the users.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.360
And this is despite them not having

23:24.360 --> 23:26.640
a direct deliverable of any kind.

23:26.640 --> 23:27.920
Right, exactly.

23:27.920 --> 23:31.180
And despite some people wanting to turn it into that,

23:31.180 --> 23:33.040
it's definitely not intended to do that

23:33.040 --> 23:35.460
because people would not be very happy

23:35.460 --> 23:37.000
with the end result of that experience.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.440
Yes, that is the ironic thing.

23:38.440 --> 23:39.280
I mean, there's GNOME OS,

23:39.280 --> 23:41.440
but even they admit it's not for production.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.680
I mean, I think that's one of the reasons

23:42.680 --> 23:45.480
why I really enjoy new releases of Fedora.

23:45.480 --> 23:47.240
And so to say something positive here,

23:47.240 --> 23:50.520
I tried out Fedora 35 over the weekend

23:50.520 --> 23:54.040
and kept it up to date and it's got GNOME 41 in there.

23:54.040 --> 23:55.740
And there is some nice things to see,

23:55.740 --> 23:57.680
like something I used to have to use an extension for,

23:57.680 --> 24:00.560
integrating power profiles is now just built into GNOME.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.120
I love seeing that.

24:02.120 --> 24:03.760
And the other thing is they have

24:03.760 --> 24:06.120
a new multitask settings pane

24:06.120 --> 24:08.360
that you can go into the GNOME control center

24:08.360 --> 24:10.840
and go to multitasking and you can kind of configure

24:10.840 --> 24:12.880
some of your options like window snapping and whatnot.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.520
It's well done.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.160
And on the Fedora side,

24:16.160 --> 24:18.960
they've worked to enable parts of Flat Hub

24:18.960 --> 24:20.440
if you enable the third party repo.

24:20.440 --> 24:23.560
So now you have Flat Hub in your GNOME software search.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.300
I mean, like there's really good stuff happening here.

24:26.300 --> 24:27.520
Not to mention on the backend,

24:27.520 --> 24:31.000
Fedora 35 is gonna ship with extremely improved

24:31.000 --> 24:32.760
Nvidia and Wayland support,

24:32.760 --> 24:35.840
proprietary Nvidia driver and Wayland support.

24:35.840 --> 24:36.720
Huge stuff, right?

24:36.720 --> 24:39.600
And so like the development is still continuing

24:39.600 --> 24:41.860
and good stuff is being created,

24:41.860 --> 24:44.760
but they are extremely confident in their opinion

24:44.760 --> 24:46.640
on how it's being consumed

24:46.640 --> 24:48.480
and what direction they need to go.

24:48.480 --> 24:52.000
And I'll link to a blog post that says the truth.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.960
They're not telling you about themes

24:53.960 --> 24:55.080
and it's worth a read.

24:55.080 --> 24:56.540
You know, so you can hear their response

24:56.540 --> 24:57.600
and you can hear their side of it.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.840
I'll have that linked in the show notes

24:58.840 --> 25:02.420
at linuxunplug.com slash 424.

25:02.420 --> 25:04.040
Thanks for joining us, Josh.

25:04.040 --> 25:06.840
I'm glad that there are people like you out there

25:06.840 --> 25:09.000
shaping the software and the distros

25:09.000 --> 25:11.480
that the rest of us end users out there

25:11.480 --> 25:12.600
are just getting to enjoy.

25:12.600 --> 25:15.600
And there's a lot of hard and controversial decisions

25:15.600 --> 25:16.880
that go into that.

25:16.880 --> 25:21.040
Linode.com slash unplugged.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.720
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on your new account

25:23.720 --> 25:25.760
and you go there to support the show.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.240
Linode is our hosting provider.

25:27.240 --> 25:28.800
You know, they started in 2003

25:28.800 --> 25:32.040
and have focused on just making really great cloud hosting.

25:32.040 --> 25:34.120
And now 18 years later, here they are,

25:34.120 --> 25:35.780
independent and proud

25:35.780 --> 25:38.960
and continuing to make awesome services

25:38.960 --> 25:40.040
and now they've just grown.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.640
They've got 11 data centers, nearly a million customers.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.800
They've became their own ISP.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.720
You know, we're about to talk about our matrix server

25:46.720 --> 25:48.940
in the show and we've decided to go the route

25:48.940 --> 25:52.320
of actually setting up a dedicated Linode to host matrix.

25:52.320 --> 25:56.040
Typically, we'll do like a powerful Linode box

25:56.040 --> 25:58.520
and then we'll run a dozen containers on there

25:58.520 --> 25:59.560
or something like that,

25:59.560 --> 26:01.880
hook it up to their S3 compatible object storage

26:01.880 --> 26:03.440
for the backend storage.

26:03.440 --> 26:06.480
And it is really super simple,

26:06.480 --> 26:09.040
straightforward infrastructure to manage.

26:09.040 --> 26:10.120
Man, I tell you what,

26:10.120 --> 26:12.360
it is nothing like it used to be back in the day

26:12.360 --> 26:15.840
and they've just nailed the interface to manage all of this.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.100
So we're gonna tell you more about it,

26:17.100 --> 26:20.480
but we decided to do some upgrades to our matrix server.

26:20.480 --> 26:24.300
And I just love, love, love, love how simple it is

26:24.300 --> 26:26.060
to increase existing volume storage

26:26.060 --> 26:28.000
and then to quickly add new disks.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.080
And then you click a few buttons and boom,

26:31.080 --> 26:33.320
there's just this new amazing amount of disk

26:33.320 --> 26:35.400
available to your Linode.

26:35.400 --> 26:37.040
And it's just so straightforward.

26:37.040 --> 26:39.080
And if you ever have any like spots where like,

26:39.080 --> 26:41.040
I'm not actually sure what the command is now

26:41.040 --> 26:42.640
to mount that new disk.

26:42.640 --> 26:43.760
Well, they've just got like a little button

26:43.760 --> 26:44.600
and you push that button.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.520
It's like, hey, this is the command you need to run.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.540
It's really straightforward.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.920
Plus they have a very powerful DNS manager,

26:50.920 --> 26:53.480
which we use all the time when we're moving services around

26:53.480 --> 26:55.000
or testing something out.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.800
They're also now offering bare metal servers.

26:57.800 --> 26:58.980
That could be pretty wild

26:58.980 --> 27:02.340
because they have super fast systems.

27:02.340 --> 27:04.140
They have screamers of boxes.

27:04.140 --> 27:06.720
So I can imagine a bare metal, I mean, I don't even know.

27:06.720 --> 27:07.920
I don't know what you're doing,

27:07.920 --> 27:09.760
but that's a pretty cool option to have out there.

27:09.760 --> 27:12.300
And then you combine that with their super fast SSDs

27:12.300 --> 27:13.840
and their super fast networking.

27:13.840 --> 27:16.080
I mean, it's obvious why we just host everything there.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.920
And I will admit to you that there is a bit of,

27:18.920 --> 27:21.220
well, they're also part of the Linux community.

27:21.220 --> 27:24.480
They're the real Linux people that really love this stuff.

27:24.480 --> 27:27.680
And they have just got into this

27:27.680 --> 27:29.180
for the love of the technology.

27:29.180 --> 27:31.320
And I can really connect with that.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.960
And I can really connect with wanting to stay independent.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.520
And those are the aspects of Linode

27:35.520 --> 27:38.480
that I think are not really listed on a webpage

27:38.480 --> 27:41.140
or part of their dashboard UI,

27:41.140 --> 27:43.800
but part of what made me comfortable leaving town

27:43.800 --> 27:46.080
and knowing that my infrastructure was running on Linode.

27:46.080 --> 27:49.200
And I'm really grateful that I took the time

27:49.200 --> 27:52.480
to just set up a Linode to back up our on-premises server

27:52.480 --> 27:55.400
that did eventually go down while I was traveling.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.720
And it kept us going.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.600
When the prices are 30 to 50% cheaper

27:59.600 --> 28:02.480
than the major cloud hyperscaler duopolies out there,

28:02.480 --> 28:04.960
like you can afford to do something like that,

28:04.960 --> 28:08.080
especially if you're taking advantage of our $100 offer.

28:08.080 --> 28:10.400
So go to linode.com slash unplugged,

28:10.400 --> 28:12.720
get $100 a 60-day credit on a new account

28:12.720 --> 28:14.240
and see what I've been talking about,

28:14.240 --> 28:17.480
but also you support this independent production.

28:17.480 --> 28:18.740
And that's pretty great.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.400
You're using a service provider that loves Linux

28:21.400 --> 28:23.360
to support a Linux podcast.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.240
That's the kind of thing I'm talking about.

28:25.240 --> 28:27.620
Linode.com slash unplugged.

28:27.620 --> 28:30.620
Well, we just have a couple of more community news items.

28:30.620 --> 28:33.760
I do want to give a plug for Seagull,

28:33.760 --> 28:36.520
which is coming up soon and is virtual again this year,

28:36.520 --> 28:39.360
which means it's not just going to be in the Seattle area.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.840
Anyone can attend.

28:40.840 --> 28:44.160
It's Friday and Saturday, November 5th and 6th.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.840
So you have a little bit of time.

28:45.840 --> 28:47.000
It's now available worldwide.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
You can go over to their website and get all the details.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.520
It's at Seagull.org, and it started back in 2013.

28:54.520 --> 28:57.800
And now it's grown to have over 50 presentations, four keynotes.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.120
It's got a career workshop.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.640
I want to double mention that, actually,

29:00.640 --> 29:03.560
because I've heard good things about that from our audience.

29:03.560 --> 29:07.040
And they also have the Cascadia Community Builder Award.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.800
And it's in its ninth year now.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.080
And it's one of those, it's like Linux Fest Northwest.

29:11.080 --> 29:15.640
It's a grassroots, free, labor, open-source culture event.

29:15.640 --> 29:18.640
Meaning, if you're just kind of getting into the system

29:18.640 --> 29:21.240
or you want to learn more about the free software world,

29:21.240 --> 29:22.840
it's a great way to get started.

29:22.840 --> 29:25.360
The free software world, it's a great event for that.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.920
And because it's virtual, it's something you can try out.

29:27.920 --> 29:29.080
Try it before you buy now.

29:29.080 --> 29:32.440
Yeah, it really is just a friendly, welcoming spot.

29:32.440 --> 29:36.320
It does kind of, in some ways, feel like the early days.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.520
It's still growing.

29:37.520 --> 29:39.320
It's still a rather small community.

29:39.320 --> 29:42.000
It's just a great place to get some Linux and free culture

29:42.000 --> 29:42.840
content.

29:42.840 --> 29:43.520
There's another.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.840
Isn't the open-source summit coming up really soon, too,

29:45.840 --> 29:46.560
in our area?

29:46.560 --> 29:47.680
It is, yeah.

29:47.680 --> 29:49.720
At the end of this month, is it this week?

29:49.720 --> 29:51.840
Well, I got back just at the right time, didn't I?

29:51.840 --> 29:53.720
Like, these events are kicking off now.

29:53.720 --> 29:55.260
And I think that one's actually going

29:55.260 --> 29:58.120
to be an in-person and virtual mix event.

29:58.120 --> 30:00.520
So that could be worth checking out.

30:00.520 --> 30:03.560
It's September 27 through Thursday, September 30.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.520
We have a friend coming in town that I'm hoping we,

30:05.520 --> 30:07.000
I need to email.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.880
And you and I can maybe take out to dinner.

30:09.880 --> 30:10.840
So that could be great.

30:10.840 --> 30:12.360
It is nice to be back.

30:12.360 --> 30:13.960
You know, we made it back last Thursday.

30:13.960 --> 30:16.560
You survived the brutal heat of the West.

30:16.560 --> 30:18.200
Oh, man.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.440
What a summer to go on a summer road trip.

30:20.440 --> 30:21.640
That was a mistake.

30:21.640 --> 30:26.880
Talk about mistake number one, going during the summer that's

30:26.880 --> 30:29.080
like the hottest summer of my life.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.000
That was dumb.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.120
But of course, it really came down

30:31.120 --> 30:32.760
to when the kids were out of school, right?

30:32.760 --> 30:34.000
Which is during the summer, so.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.040
You had a lot of factors.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.220
You had a damaged slide.

30:36.220 --> 30:37.640
I mean, what's a man to do?

30:37.640 --> 30:37.960
Right.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.760
And we ended up with the broken suspension.

30:39.760 --> 30:42.920
So last week's episode, wow, was it just last week

30:42.920 --> 30:44.560
where I was stranded in Tucson?

30:44.560 --> 30:44.920
Whoa.

30:44.920 --> 30:45.520
Yes, it was.

30:45.520 --> 30:46.800
That's wild.

30:46.800 --> 30:49.200
Jeez, a lot has happened in the last week.

30:49.200 --> 30:52.080
So we made it to a suspension shop the day after the show

30:52.080 --> 30:53.160
last week.

30:53.160 --> 30:56.160
They mostly fixed us up and got us down the road.

30:56.160 --> 30:59.760
We made just a beeline for the California coast, which

30:59.760 --> 31:02.240
meant we had to go through like some of the hottest

31:02.240 --> 31:03.700
areas for a while.

31:03.700 --> 31:06.240
It was brutal for a couple of days.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.960
I don't think there was a day for the first couple of days

31:08.960 --> 31:09.720
we left Tucson.

31:09.720 --> 31:11.880
The first two days, I don't think

31:11.880 --> 31:13.120
it went below 90 at night.

31:13.120 --> 31:15.920
And I don't think it was below 102 during the day.

31:15.920 --> 31:20.040
And for extra fun, the dash AC went caputs again on Lady Joop.

31:20.040 --> 31:22.720
So I had just hot air blown on me.

31:22.720 --> 31:24.960
It was brutal.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.400
But we pulled through.

31:26.400 --> 31:26.900
We made it.

31:26.900 --> 31:29.880
And we made a beeline for Highway 101.

31:29.880 --> 31:32.160
We kind of bypassed San Francisco.

31:32.160 --> 31:35.240
And we bypassed Los Angeles and went on a new route

31:35.240 --> 31:38.560
that we'd never taken before and got to Highway 101, where

31:38.560 --> 31:39.420
it was glorious.

31:39.420 --> 31:40.940
It was like 60 degrees.

31:40.940 --> 31:43.480
And it was nice to see the Pacific Ocean again.

31:43.480 --> 31:45.760
That was really, that felt pretty special.

31:45.760 --> 31:47.800
And we ended up winding our way up the coast

31:47.800 --> 31:49.480
with a half-broken suspension system

31:49.480 --> 31:51.880
when we got to our shop in Southern Oregon.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.780
And they did discover the mistake

31:53.780 --> 31:55.480
that they had made when they installed it the first time.

31:55.480 --> 31:56.780
So they fixed it under warranty.

31:56.780 --> 31:59.280
And while we were there, we had a couple of extra suspension

31:59.280 --> 32:00.520
parts upgraded.

32:00.520 --> 32:03.360
So in a way, Joops is better than ever now.

32:03.360 --> 32:05.720
I wish I could have done that work before the road trip.

32:05.720 --> 32:07.680
But we didn't need to get done.

32:07.680 --> 32:08.880
So that's what it is.

32:08.880 --> 32:09.760
And now we're back.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.280
I've been reflecting on the meetups.

32:11.280 --> 32:13.200
They were awesome.

32:13.200 --> 32:14.600
Brent, you made it to both of them.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.360
Wes, you made it to the Denver meetup.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.440
I mean, I think they were both just fantastic.

32:18.440 --> 32:20.520
The Denver meetup was one of our best ever, I think.

32:20.520 --> 32:22.280
I think they were more than awesome.

32:22.280 --> 32:24.320
It totally outpaced my expectations.

32:24.320 --> 32:26.680
It was incredible to be surrounded by what?

32:26.680 --> 32:29.600
It was like someone counted like 90 people in Denver

32:29.600 --> 32:30.520
or something like that.

32:30.520 --> 32:31.320
It was amazing.

32:31.320 --> 32:32.840
Yeah, something like that.

32:32.840 --> 32:34.040
Something close to 100.

32:34.040 --> 32:36.040
I don't know exactly, because people were coming and going.

32:36.040 --> 32:37.720
And people from all over the world, too,

32:37.720 --> 32:38.600
which was incredible.

32:38.600 --> 32:39.520
I didn't expect that at all.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.760
I thought it was going to just be sort of local folks,

32:41.760 --> 32:43.520
but all over the place.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.680
You think you're already impressed with the audience,

32:45.680 --> 32:47.400
and then something like Denver.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.440
I know, really.

32:48.440 --> 32:49.560
Salt Lake City was great.

32:49.560 --> 32:51.160
The micro meetups were great.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.880
But Denver was such a unique experience,

32:52.880 --> 32:54.680
because there were so many people there.

32:54.680 --> 32:58.200
And there was just such good conversations.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.880
There is a nice thing about getting

33:00.880 --> 33:02.600
to reconnect with people in real life

33:02.600 --> 33:04.640
and having a common set of interests,

33:04.640 --> 33:07.040
like open source and the shows.

33:07.040 --> 33:10.480
So we have immediately a whole just incredible wealth

33:10.480 --> 33:12.120
of things to talk about.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.200
And that's really cool.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.440
You don't generally just meet a stranger

33:16.440 --> 33:20.320
and have two hours worth of conversation material.

33:20.320 --> 33:21.680
It's a special experience.

33:21.680 --> 33:24.320
I found that actually difficult, because I didn't get a chance

33:24.320 --> 33:26.240
to talk to very many people, because there were so

33:26.240 --> 33:28.600
many great conversations happening.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.800
I got a list of 10 people that I was like, god, next time.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.200
But I feel like it was exactly what we needed.

33:34.200 --> 33:37.400
And then for me personally, we got to have a family road trip.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.480
We got to have Brent come along for a bit.

33:39.480 --> 33:39.980
Uncle Brent.

33:39.980 --> 33:41.840
There was all those elements, right?

33:41.840 --> 33:43.560
Uncle Brent came along for a little while,

33:43.560 --> 33:44.320
and that was nice.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.160
I got the badge.

33:45.160 --> 33:46.880
Yeah, you did.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.320
It was exactly what we needed.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.600
And I think also it was nice for our team, the Jupiter

33:50.600 --> 33:52.940
broadcasting team, to reconnect.

33:52.940 --> 33:54.520
As many of us who could make it, we

33:54.520 --> 33:57.920
got to hang out at the Airbnb and just chill for a bit

33:57.920 --> 34:01.020
with each other and see each other in our pajamas,

34:01.020 --> 34:02.840
all that kind of stuff, and our bed hair.

34:02.840 --> 34:06.280
Yeah, the kind of just staying familiar and chatting

34:06.280 --> 34:08.800
about non-show stuff that you don't always get to in a busy

34:08.800 --> 34:09.760
show-filled week.

34:09.760 --> 34:10.320
Right.

34:10.320 --> 34:10.840
Yeah.

34:10.840 --> 34:14.080
It was really our first chance to get together

34:14.080 --> 34:16.720
since going independent a year ago,

34:16.720 --> 34:18.520
because it's been lockdowns and stuff.

34:18.520 --> 34:21.120
We haven't had a chance to really get together and kind

34:21.120 --> 34:24.400
of acknowledge that here we are now as this meta team working

34:24.400 --> 34:26.640
together still after a lot of things have changed.

34:26.640 --> 34:29.140
And it's not all of us, and not all of us could make it,

34:29.140 --> 34:30.320
but it's still a core of us.

34:30.320 --> 34:31.640
And that was really nice to see.

34:31.640 --> 34:33.080
Keeps the fire alive.

34:33.080 --> 34:34.240
Yeah, so that was great.

34:34.240 --> 34:38.680
But we're home, and I am packing up my home base this week

34:38.680 --> 34:40.160
because we're moving out.

34:40.160 --> 34:42.280
I don't know where to yet.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.820
So I'm going to be figuring that out over the next few weeks.

34:44.820 --> 34:46.440
But it's good to be back in the area.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.440
It's so nice to be back in the studio.

34:48.440 --> 34:51.400
I heard you were thinking Tucson.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.480
Never, never, never.

34:53.480 --> 34:56.600
All right, let's do a little matrix update.

34:56.600 --> 34:57.920
IRC is great.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.640
I mean, don't take this the wrong way.

34:59.640 --> 35:02.600
I'm not taking away from your preferred chat platform.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.680
How dare you?

35:03.680 --> 35:06.240
I know, we still have a IRC chat room, really.

35:06.240 --> 35:08.520
But I'm just getting more and more of a sense

35:08.520 --> 35:12.000
that the free software community is adopting Matrix

35:12.000 --> 35:14.080
at a faster and faster clip.

35:14.080 --> 35:15.960
We've talked about Matrix before on the show,

35:15.960 --> 35:17.420
and they recently had an announcement

35:17.420 --> 35:19.640
about a transition they're making from communities

35:19.640 --> 35:21.080
to spaces.

35:21.080 --> 35:24.300
And I just wasn't really ready to talk about it on the show

35:24.300 --> 35:27.480
because I have been unable to wrap my head around what it

35:27.480 --> 35:28.360
really is.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.480
And I went to the Matrix blog this morning

35:30.480 --> 35:32.440
to try to reread their announcement.

35:32.440 --> 35:35.640
And honestly, it just doesn't make any sense for me

35:35.640 --> 35:37.560
because it sounds like you can have

35:37.560 --> 35:40.400
spaces, which are essentially community pages that

35:40.400 --> 35:41.840
can link to other channels.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.360
And it's called a space.

35:43.360 --> 35:47.600
And so you can have a space that is a Matrix spaces.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.500
And then you can have multiple spaces,

35:49.500 --> 35:51.320
like we could have a Linux unplugged space,

35:51.320 --> 35:53.320
and we could have a self-hosted space,

35:53.320 --> 35:56.000
and we could have a Jupiter broadcasting metaspace.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.520
And those would all be spaces that link to spaces,

35:59.520 --> 36:01.180
but they're individually called space.

36:01.180 --> 36:04.520
And I find the entire thing absolutely confusing.

36:04.520 --> 36:07.720
So we were chatting in a Luplug with Gamma about Matrix.

36:07.720 --> 36:09.380
And I said, hold on, hold on, hold on.

36:09.380 --> 36:10.680
Let's record it for the show.

36:10.680 --> 36:13.040
So spoiler, this is actually happening on a Sunday,

36:13.040 --> 36:14.800
this part, this recording.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.720
Gamma, can you give me a high-level understanding

36:17.720 --> 36:21.280
of what Matrix spaces are and when

36:21.280 --> 36:23.320
I would want to create a space?

36:23.320 --> 36:26.520
So Matrix spaces are basically glorified folders.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.400
They let you group rooms, either that you own

36:29.400 --> 36:32.560
or maybe that someone else owns.

36:32.560 --> 36:34.760
Just collect them together into a single folder

36:34.760 --> 36:37.840
in your element UI or another client's UI.

36:37.840 --> 36:38.680
Wow.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.040
OK.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.040
So you can start, right?

36:41.040 --> 36:43.840
It looks like there's both private and public spaces.

36:43.840 --> 36:46.240
But you can kind of start with just making a private space

36:46.240 --> 36:48.160
where you might collect, like if you're

36:48.160 --> 36:49.520
in multiple communities in mod, you

36:49.520 --> 36:51.580
could collect all your mod channels right there

36:51.580 --> 36:52.300
in one space.

36:52.300 --> 36:55.100
Or if you had different feedback for each of the shows

36:55.100 --> 36:57.440
or something, you could have one feedback space, maybe.

36:57.440 --> 36:58.080
Oh.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.520
Yeah, so I thought maybe you should

36:59.520 --> 37:01.000
try making a space for yourself.

37:01.000 --> 37:01.720
I'll do it right now.

37:01.720 --> 37:02.280
All right.

37:02.280 --> 37:05.880
So I am on the beta version of Element to get this working.

37:05.880 --> 37:06.720
The web UI.

37:06.720 --> 37:07.600
Yeah, on the web UI.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.680
But it's really easy to get going there.

37:09.680 --> 37:12.760
And you can also go to, what is it, develop.element.io

37:12.760 --> 37:15.620
if you want to check it out, or develop.element.io.

37:15.620 --> 37:17.240
So first, I'm going to create a space.

37:17.240 --> 37:19.640
So I can create a public space or a private space.

37:19.640 --> 37:20.560
What do you think?

37:20.560 --> 37:22.000
You can probably just start with a private one

37:22.000 --> 37:23.200
since you don't know what you're doing.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.200
I like your idea of making a feedback space.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.440
So maybe I'll do feedback.

37:26.440 --> 37:27.640
And this could be like the different feedback

37:27.640 --> 37:28.320
channels we have.

37:28.320 --> 37:28.820
Right.

37:28.820 --> 37:30.280
Oh, this is OK.

37:30.280 --> 37:31.640
I'm getting this.

37:31.640 --> 37:32.960
And so it needs a description.

37:32.960 --> 37:37.120
So I'll call it where people tend to yell at me.

37:37.120 --> 37:37.800
OK.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.100
Go ahead and put that in there.

37:39.100 --> 37:41.480
Oh, I got a couple extra yells I need to put in that one.

37:41.480 --> 37:42.360
Yell.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.920
Don't forget the exclamation point.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.360
Oh, yeah, you're right.

37:45.360 --> 37:46.160
Yeah, there we go.

37:46.160 --> 37:47.000
OK, so I create that.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.520
And I can upload a picture too.

37:48.520 --> 37:50.040
Looks like you can even upload a GIF.

37:50.040 --> 37:50.680
Oh, my.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.040
So who are you working with?

37:52.040 --> 37:56.320
So make sure the right people have access to feedback.

37:56.320 --> 37:57.280
Huh.

37:57.280 --> 37:59.880
I can do just me, which is a private space.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.520
I can do me and my teammates a private space for you

38:02.520 --> 38:04.320
and your teammates.

38:04.320 --> 38:05.240
I'm going to do that.

38:05.240 --> 38:07.000
There's also some version maybe we end up

38:07.000 --> 38:11.640
with a Jupiter broadcasting sort of back end matrix space

38:11.640 --> 38:13.020
or set up or channels.

38:13.020 --> 38:13.640
Yeah.

38:13.640 --> 38:16.200
Oh, well, that seems like the way I'd want it is I'd want it

38:16.200 --> 38:17.000
for everybody then.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.040
So you're saying if I made it, oh, so I don't understand.

38:21.040 --> 38:23.000
Isn't this going to be essentially server side

38:23.000 --> 38:24.240
if I invite everybody to it?

38:24.240 --> 38:25.040
Yeah, I suppose so.

38:25.040 --> 38:25.560
All right, OK.

38:25.560 --> 38:26.080
I don't know.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.680
I've only made one space so far.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.640
What's interesting, though, is I wanted to invite you.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.440
But now it wants me to put in your email address.

38:31.440 --> 38:34.200
But I don't know off the top of my head what email address.

38:34.200 --> 38:35.520
I mean, I have a good guess.

38:35.520 --> 38:36.560
But I don't know off the top of my head

38:36.560 --> 38:38.680
what email address you used with your matrix account.

38:38.680 --> 38:39.280
I don't either.

38:39.280 --> 38:41.080
And I wouldn't know that for anybody, right?

38:41.080 --> 38:43.200
I know their matrix username.

38:43.200 --> 38:44.440
Is it asking for their email?

38:44.440 --> 38:45.160
Yeah.

38:45.160 --> 38:47.480
Looks like at the bottom there's an invite by username.

38:47.480 --> 38:48.640
Oh, Wes is right.

38:48.640 --> 38:49.120
Great.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.040
Out at the bottom I can invite.

38:50.040 --> 38:50.720
OK, great.

38:50.720 --> 38:53.840
So I'm going to bring I can bring Wes in there.

38:53.840 --> 38:54.360
Great.

38:54.360 --> 38:56.160
I'll bring some of the other guys in.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.440
That should probably be flipped.

38:57.440 --> 38:59.720
It should be invite by user by default.

38:59.720 --> 39:01.200
Yeah, but either way, I figured it out, right?

39:01.200 --> 39:01.560
You're right.

39:01.560 --> 39:04.120
I got caught up on it because I was looking at the default.

39:04.120 --> 39:05.320
But you can go dig around.

39:05.320 --> 39:07.200
So I just invited you.

39:07.200 --> 39:07.680
OK.

39:07.680 --> 39:09.880
And then I'll say skip for now, because otherwise I

39:09.880 --> 39:10.960
can't move on.

39:10.960 --> 39:12.720
Yep, I've got a feedback invitation.

39:12.720 --> 39:13.800
I can reject or accept.

39:13.800 --> 39:15.800
It tells me it's a private space.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.720
So now I can create a room.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.320
And then you can also add rooms.

39:19.320 --> 39:21.240
So maybe we'll do like, what should we call it?

39:21.240 --> 39:23.560
We'll call this general share room name random.

39:23.560 --> 39:25.040
OK, fine.

39:25.040 --> 39:26.480
Creating the room.

39:26.480 --> 39:28.400
And now I can see suggested rooms.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.600
We have general and random, and I can.

39:30.600 --> 39:33.600
I still don't really understand what I'm looking at here.

39:33.600 --> 39:38.040
So now it's created rooms for us that are part of this space.

39:38.040 --> 39:41.040
So it's like subnested rooms is what we've just made.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.960
So what is the difference between a community,

39:42.960 --> 39:45.240
which is what it used to be in matrix, to now what

39:45.240 --> 39:46.320
is called a space?

39:46.320 --> 39:48.920
Like, are they essentially serving the same purpose

39:48.920 --> 39:51.040
where it's a landing page that you can now

39:51.040 --> 39:55.040
create for yourself or room admins can set up for the room?

39:55.040 --> 39:56.360
Help me understand this, Gamma.

39:56.360 --> 39:57.680
They're effectively the same.

39:57.680 --> 40:00.840
The main reason why they went away from the old community

40:00.840 --> 40:04.080
style was that the matrix devs found that they were

40:04.080 --> 40:06.360
re-implementing the same types of rules,

40:06.360 --> 40:09.760
the same types of administration, protocol,

40:09.760 --> 40:12.920
et cetera, just redoing everything for communities

40:12.920 --> 40:15.040
that they had already done for their rooms.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.040
So what they decided was, you know what?

40:17.040 --> 40:19.000
We're just going to trash communities,

40:19.000 --> 40:21.600
and we'll just make a special type of room.

40:21.600 --> 40:22.920
It just works like a normal room,

40:22.920 --> 40:26.120
but it just has these special flags in it

40:26.120 --> 40:29.600
that say, hey, I'm actually a folder and not a room.

40:29.600 --> 40:32.120
Ah, and I see here, so I was looking in the room settings,

40:32.120 --> 40:35.520
and by default here, it's set with anyone in a space

40:35.520 --> 40:36.320
can find and join.

40:36.320 --> 40:37.760
So spaces with access feedback.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.760
So for the moment, it is just private.

40:39.760 --> 40:41.080
It kind of works how you'd expect.

40:41.080 --> 40:42.380
OK, I'm starting to get it now.

40:42.380 --> 40:47.520
So it shows up in my sidebar as a separate instance, almost.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.880
Like, I have our main chat here, and then I have a,

40:49.880 --> 40:52.440
now I have a dedicated entry for this feedback space

40:52.440 --> 40:53.320
that we created.

40:53.320 --> 40:55.120
And I'm starting to see the benefit of that

40:55.120 --> 40:57.000
is if you had people on multiple servers

40:57.000 --> 41:00.920
that didn't normally coalesce in some of those rooms,

41:00.920 --> 41:03.120
we could bring them into this space

41:03.120 --> 41:05.240
and just have this set of rooms that they would see.

41:05.240 --> 41:08.040
It's like cross-server collaboration space as well.

41:08.040 --> 41:09.360
Yeah, and you can add spaces.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.840
You can add rooms.

41:11.840 --> 41:14.120
I think what's interesting to my mind,

41:14.120 --> 41:16.080
reading through that, I can try to think of it

41:16.080 --> 41:18.200
from the developer side, and it's

41:18.200 --> 41:19.840
almost like you've exposed yourself

41:19.840 --> 41:22.240
to all the underpinnings you would need to build something

41:22.240 --> 41:23.760
like Discord right with Matrix.

41:23.760 --> 41:26.840
And so to some extent, that shifts where that boundary is.

41:26.840 --> 41:28.680
And I think part of the problem is you

41:28.680 --> 41:31.240
can build your own private Discord server in a space.

41:31.240 --> 41:31.960
Yeah, exactly.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.600
And that means that we're kind of taking

41:33.600 --> 41:35.760
on some of the admin layer of how,

41:35.760 --> 41:38.480
because this is so flexible and it's not necessarily clear

41:38.480 --> 41:40.760
as you've discovered what exactly you can do,

41:40.760 --> 41:42.440
part of that is because you can build it

41:42.440 --> 41:44.280
in so many different ways depending on what

41:44.280 --> 41:45.440
you actually want to do.

41:45.440 --> 41:46.720
Yeah, OK.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.360
I'm starting to wrap my head around it.

41:48.360 --> 41:51.040
So Gamma, I'm wondering if you have any opinions, at least

41:51.040 --> 41:52.640
your personal opinion, on maybe how

41:52.640 --> 41:55.240
Jupyter Broadcasting could utilize a matrix space

41:55.240 --> 41:56.840
or multiple spaces, I suppose?

41:56.840 --> 41:58.840
Certainly, you can take the lessons

41:58.840 --> 42:02.560
you've learned from the self-hosted Discord server.

42:02.560 --> 42:04.240
In Discord, you have various channels

42:04.240 --> 42:08.680
which are used to discuss general chat, off-topic chat,

42:08.680 --> 42:10.760
talk about the show itself.

42:10.760 --> 42:13.120
The equivalent in Matrix is a room.

42:13.120 --> 42:14.880
So you could create multiple rooms,

42:14.880 --> 42:17.640
put them all within a Linux-unplugged space

42:17.640 --> 42:19.400
if they're all related to that show,

42:19.400 --> 42:22.200
and then put the Linux-unplugged space within this bigger

42:22.200 --> 42:24.160
net of Jupyter Broadcasting.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.920
That is a fantastic idea, because you

42:25.920 --> 42:28.400
get all the benefits of it's nice with, say,

42:28.400 --> 42:29.560
the self-hosted Discord.

42:29.560 --> 42:31.680
The reason why I think it's been kind of successful

42:31.680 --> 42:34.000
is because that kind of topic, self-hosting,

42:34.000 --> 42:35.760
there's a ton of different channels

42:35.760 --> 42:38.440
that seem appropriate for that particular topic.

42:38.440 --> 42:41.040
And it would just sort of blast Matrix

42:41.040 --> 42:44.480
to just create everything in one Jupyter Broadcasting area.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.880
But creating individual spaces for the shows

42:46.880 --> 42:49.400
kind of lets you get that benefit

42:49.400 --> 42:51.240
while still taking advantage of everything

42:51.240 --> 42:54.040
being connected, because it's part of a larger space.

42:54.040 --> 42:54.920
I'm getting it.

42:54.920 --> 42:57.200
I think the terminology is complicated.

42:57.200 --> 43:00.160
And I think that matters more than we give it credit

43:00.160 --> 43:02.120
in our technical community.

43:02.120 --> 43:04.720
And I think that kind of complicated language

43:04.720 --> 43:07.440
is a friction point that turns people off.

43:07.440 --> 43:09.240
But our community doesn't seem to mind it.

43:09.240 --> 43:11.040
And I see a lot of your laughing over there.

43:11.040 --> 43:14.120
No, no, I mean, I can't argue with that.

43:14.120 --> 43:18.600
It seems like, slowly, the paths through the UX and the UI

43:18.600 --> 43:21.440
are improving and getting a refined layer at the top.

43:21.440 --> 43:23.840
But you still see a lot of the plumbing.

43:23.840 --> 43:26.960
Well, we touched on permissions with spaces a little bit

43:26.960 --> 43:28.760
there, but, Gamma, it sounds like there

43:28.760 --> 43:30.600
might be some future improvements making

43:30.600 --> 43:31.960
this work a little bit smoother.

43:31.960 --> 43:33.280
Yes, it's very true.

43:33.280 --> 43:37.480
Currently, a room can either be public or private.

43:37.480 --> 43:40.320
But private rooms mean that you have to get an invite

43:40.320 --> 43:41.560
in order to join.

43:41.560 --> 43:43.240
But if you're already a member of a space

43:43.240 --> 43:46.160
and you want to join a private room inside of it,

43:46.160 --> 43:49.040
there's actually a proposal that will just let that happen

43:49.040 --> 43:50.600
for free without an invite.

43:50.600 --> 43:52.440
Yeah, I can see how that might be useful.

43:52.440 --> 43:54.840
Otherwise, you have to sort of manually add everyone

43:54.840 --> 43:56.440
at the onboarding time or someone

43:56.440 --> 43:58.520
has to handle making sure all those permissions transfer.

43:58.520 --> 44:00.120
But if you are maintaining something

44:00.120 --> 44:01.680
like a trusted space already and you just

44:01.680 --> 44:03.400
want to have a bunch of private rooms in it,

44:03.400 --> 44:04.720
that might work a lot better.

44:04.720 --> 44:05.760
I would imagine there's probably going

44:05.760 --> 44:07.220
to be a lot of areas of improvement

44:07.220 --> 44:10.240
as more and more people adopt this feature.

44:10.240 --> 44:13.440
It still seems like it's not really even fully rolled out

44:13.440 --> 44:13.920
yet.

44:13.920 --> 44:17.280
So we probably even really haven't seen the bulk of feedback

44:17.280 --> 44:19.440
that the team's going to get once more people start using

44:19.440 --> 44:20.080
Spaces.

44:20.080 --> 44:21.780
Yes, and it seems like, as always,

44:21.780 --> 44:23.400
the biggest problem right here is

44:23.400 --> 44:27.200
a little bit of communication and a little bit of UX.

44:27.200 --> 44:29.640
Well, Gamma, thank you for helping us do at least

44:29.640 --> 44:32.640
a little bit of an update on what's going on with Matrix.

44:32.640 --> 44:35.080
But there is a ton of stuff going on all the time.

44:35.080 --> 44:36.640
And you've got a couple of resources

44:36.640 --> 44:38.120
people could follow up on if they

44:38.120 --> 44:41.120
want to dive deeper into the going ons with Matrix.

44:41.120 --> 44:42.000
Of course.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.800
I highly recommend checking out This Week in Matrix.

44:44.800 --> 44:48.600
It's a feed of all the fun projects, all the neat stuff

44:48.600 --> 44:52.960
that people are doing in Matrix, clients, servers, bridges,

44:52.960 --> 44:54.720
bots, everything.

44:54.720 --> 44:56.780
Also, there is Matrix Live, which

44:56.780 --> 45:01.400
is a weekly show with the team on Matrix or Synapse

45:01.400 --> 45:04.600
or Elements doing deep dives into various topics.

45:04.600 --> 45:07.800
And finally, just a personal interest,

45:07.800 --> 45:09.760
there is a channel that was mentioned

45:09.760 --> 45:13.240
during one of the This Weeks in Matrix called Beyond Chat,

45:13.240 --> 45:16.680
which talks about various uses for Matrix beyond chat.

45:16.680 --> 45:19.880
Thank you to Gamma for taking a little bit of time

45:19.880 --> 45:21.280
on his Sunday.

45:21.280 --> 45:23.000
MiniMech was there with us, too.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.660
And what were your first impressions

45:24.660 --> 45:26.240
of setting up spaces, MiniMech?

45:26.240 --> 45:28.680
Yeah, so after the conversation you had with Gamma,

45:28.680 --> 45:31.600
I enabled in the element client I used,

45:31.600 --> 45:34.520
I enabled the beta channel, which

45:34.520 --> 45:36.320
allows me to have these spaces.

45:36.320 --> 45:37.720
So that is pretty easy.

45:37.720 --> 45:42.800
So Gamma was kindly linking his space in the Loblog channel.

45:42.800 --> 45:46.600
So once you click on that, you get a pop-up window

45:46.600 --> 45:49.160
that allows you to enable the beta channel

45:49.160 --> 45:50.720
to have the spaces.

45:50.720 --> 45:55.680
Once I did this, then it was like seeing is understanding.

45:55.680 --> 45:59.800
So what you get is an additional panel with a home icon,

45:59.800 --> 46:02.520
where you'll find all the rooms and private conversations

46:02.520 --> 46:03.540
you had before.

46:03.540 --> 46:07.480
And underneath, I got that Gamma channel or Gamma space,

46:07.480 --> 46:10.760
how to say, where I got all the proposition that Gamma

46:10.760 --> 46:13.040
put in in that space.

46:13.040 --> 46:17.200
So for me, that element client is a little bit cluttered.

46:17.200 --> 46:21.600
But with this, it was very interesting to see.

46:21.600 --> 46:23.880
It was quite easy to navigate.

46:23.880 --> 46:26.360
And then I started to understand that.

46:26.360 --> 46:27.640
And then so I went further.

46:27.640 --> 46:30.120
So I created my own space, private space.

46:30.120 --> 46:34.760
And I put in all the JPMetrix channels in it.

46:34.760 --> 46:38.160
And what I saw is that they disappear from the home channel.

46:38.160 --> 46:41.920
And they appear in that private space

46:41.920 --> 46:43.880
I did for Jupiter broadcasting, although there

46:43.880 --> 46:48.720
is a feature that you can make them pop up again in the home.

46:48.720 --> 46:52.040
And so I was able to group all these channels.

46:52.040 --> 46:53.520
And that was really easy.

46:53.520 --> 46:56.120
So I get all the notifications now.

46:56.120 --> 46:59.000
I get them in the JB space.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.400
And I can click on that and have all the channels grouped there.

47:02.400 --> 47:04.840
That's nice when you're part of many communities.

47:04.840 --> 47:07.000
Yeah, that's really true.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.280
Just one thing I want to add, once you

47:09.280 --> 47:11.880
start to play with these private channels

47:11.880 --> 47:15.600
and once you decide to remove or delete that space again,

47:15.600 --> 47:19.560
there's one thing you might give a little bit of attention to.

47:19.560 --> 47:23.880
If you just leave the space, you get a pop-up.

47:23.880 --> 47:26.040
And if you don't really make attention,

47:26.040 --> 47:29.880
you're leaving all the rooms that are in that space.

47:29.880 --> 47:32.520
So a good thing is you go to your private space,

47:32.520 --> 47:34.720
and then you detach all the rooms

47:34.720 --> 47:36.680
you had in your private space.

47:36.680 --> 47:38.360
They will reappear in home.

47:38.360 --> 47:40.440
And then in the end, you leave the space.

47:40.440 --> 47:41.080
I see.

47:41.080 --> 47:41.680
Otherwise.

47:41.680 --> 47:42.240
That's good to know.

47:42.240 --> 47:43.000
Yeah, it's good to know.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.040
Otherwise, it might happen that all of a sudden,

47:45.040 --> 47:48.960
you leave a room where you have administration or moderator

47:48.960 --> 47:50.040
rights in, right?

47:50.040 --> 47:51.040
I agree with you, though.

47:51.040 --> 47:53.360
I felt like it did help organize it a little bit better.

47:53.360 --> 47:55.960
And in a way, it offered some decluttering of the UI

47:55.960 --> 47:58.200
and made it easier to sort out the different matrix

47:58.200 --> 47:59.280
communities that I'm part of.

47:59.280 --> 48:00.880
Yeah, I really agree with you.

48:00.880 --> 48:03.240
So all in all, I can say it's a really good thing.

48:03.240 --> 48:06.400
Even though it is more that you see on your client,

48:06.400 --> 48:08.120
it makes it easier to navigate.

48:08.120 --> 48:09.840
So I'm a big fan.

48:09.840 --> 48:13.920
And I see I'm waiting for an official Jupyter broadcasting

48:13.920 --> 48:15.920
space to have all my channels grouped.

48:15.920 --> 48:17.600
Well, that brings us to the next topic.

48:17.600 --> 48:19.920
So Kernel has volunteered to take

48:19.920 --> 48:22.760
on the project of setting up JB spaces.

48:22.760 --> 48:25.080
And I'm sure, Kernel, you must have a few ideas.

48:25.080 --> 48:28.520
But we probably could stand for some suggestions, too.

48:28.520 --> 48:31.640
Yeah, so if anyone has any input on how

48:31.640 --> 48:35.000
they would like those spaces set up, architected,

48:35.000 --> 48:38.240
any kind of feedback regarding JB spaces,

48:38.240 --> 48:42.360
go ahead and just drop that into the LUP feedback channel

48:42.360 --> 48:43.760
on Matrix.

48:43.760 --> 48:45.400
Or I'm sure you can email the show.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.280
And Chris will pass that along to me as well.

48:47.280 --> 48:49.440
Yep, linuxunplugged.com slash contact for that.

48:49.440 --> 48:53.160
And it's nice to see our Matrix community slowly and steadily

48:53.160 --> 48:56.240
grow, even though we don't talk about it a ton on the show.

48:56.240 --> 48:59.000
We do have our Matrix server info at linuxunplugged.com

48:59.000 --> 49:01.480
slash Matrix if you would like to get on board.

49:01.480 --> 49:04.080
And it's a nice way to get your toes wet with Matrix

49:04.080 --> 49:07.040
if you haven't yet, because we have a very friendly community

49:07.040 --> 49:09.520
that's focused around the content of these shows.

49:09.520 --> 49:11.480
So it's a nice way to dip your toes.

49:11.480 --> 49:15.480
So Kernel will be monitoring that LUP Lug chat room.

49:15.480 --> 49:17.840
And that's one of the channels on our Matrix server

49:17.840 --> 49:18.680
over there.

49:18.680 --> 49:20.140
And thank you, Kernel, for doing that.

49:20.140 --> 49:22.280
But speaking of Matrix and our server,

49:22.280 --> 49:24.320
I just wanted to give a quick update.

49:24.320 --> 49:27.640
Like I've mentioned before, we do run it on a dedicated Linode

49:27.640 --> 49:28.120
box.

49:28.120 --> 49:30.760
And we did that because the Synapse server is kind of new.

49:30.760 --> 49:32.800
But Wes, you did a little sleuthing

49:32.800 --> 49:35.720
and discovered that our Synapse server, that's

49:35.720 --> 49:39.160
the server side of Matrix, is taking up a considerable chunk

49:39.160 --> 49:40.160
of storage right now.

49:40.160 --> 49:41.440
Yeah, it is.

49:41.440 --> 49:43.320
You might think out of the gate that, oh,

49:43.320 --> 49:46.480
is there just a lot of fun GIFs or other things posted

49:46.480 --> 49:47.760
on the server?

49:47.760 --> 49:48.680
I mean, there's a few.

49:48.680 --> 49:51.920
But only six gigs was Synapse user data,

49:51.920 --> 49:56.160
media files, both for local and remote stuff in the cache.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.000
That's not bad.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.360
The main bit of disk space use was about 56 gigs worth

50:01.360 --> 50:04.040
in Synapse's Postgres database.

50:04.040 --> 50:07.440
Oh, 56 gigs worth of database, huh?

50:07.440 --> 50:08.440
Jeez.

50:08.440 --> 50:10.760
What is that, just like chat log and stuff?

50:10.760 --> 50:11.920
Well, you tell me.

50:11.920 --> 50:13.040
I'll give you the schema.

50:13.040 --> 50:14.440
No, I mean, there's a lot of stuff

50:14.440 --> 50:15.880
to keep track of in Matrix.

50:15.880 --> 50:18.760
And because it's federated, we get a lot of information,

50:18.760 --> 50:21.200
some of the biggest sort of lists of state groups

50:21.200 --> 50:23.760
and the state group state is one of the tables in there

50:23.760 --> 50:26.560
that has a lot of that data.

50:26.560 --> 50:30.040
A lot of the rows in there are for the main matrix.org home

50:30.040 --> 50:31.320
server, for instance.

50:31.320 --> 50:34.360
There are some tools out there that I could find to help,

50:34.360 --> 50:37.240
like a Rust tool, in fact, that can help you compress

50:37.240 --> 50:39.440
some of that data down and make it a little simpler

50:39.440 --> 50:40.280
to navigate through.

50:40.280 --> 50:42.560
But that's not exactly quick.

50:42.560 --> 50:44.440
So I've done it for a couple of the tables.

50:44.440 --> 50:46.080
Really, we probably need to script it up

50:46.080 --> 50:47.400
to run against the whole database

50:47.400 --> 50:49.680
or the majority of the tables taking up the most space

50:49.680 --> 50:51.080
to get there.

50:51.080 --> 50:53.480
Really, the point of this is that, you know,

50:53.480 --> 50:56.480
if you're setting up synapse with a fair number of users,

50:56.480 --> 50:58.600
you're going to have to take care of it.

50:58.600 --> 50:59.800
Yeah, no kidding.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.800
Yeah, as we've discovered, it's a serious thing

51:01.800 --> 51:02.800
to run it in production.

51:02.800 --> 51:03.720
It's no joke at all.

51:03.720 --> 51:05.240
And so we've thought about, like,

51:05.240 --> 51:08.280
what can we do to address this growing problem?

51:08.280 --> 51:10.880
And we did, honestly, you guys know us,

51:10.880 --> 51:13.520
we toyed around with the idea of just moving it to like an S3

51:13.520 --> 51:16.000
Fuse file system and just throw it at object storage.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.080
But neither one of us have seen a lot of success stories

51:19.080 --> 51:21.960
about Postgres running its database off of S3 object

51:21.960 --> 51:23.920
storage on a Fuse file system.

51:23.920 --> 51:27.640
So we weren't like really super ready to jump on that one yet.

51:27.640 --> 51:29.640
Maybe if we hear good things.

51:29.640 --> 51:31.680
So what we decided to do was just

51:31.680 --> 51:33.800
go the route of adding a larger disk to the Linode.

51:33.800 --> 51:35.080
We just gave it more disk.

51:35.080 --> 51:38.840
Yeah, really saved by Linode and making it easy for us

51:38.840 --> 51:39.680
to do that, right?

51:39.680 --> 51:41.360
So yeah, kind of just moved over the volume

51:41.360 --> 51:42.880
from where it was on the original disk

51:42.880 --> 51:46.360
and now Postgres is happily running with more stuff

51:46.360 --> 51:48.320
to spare, which will make it easier as we go to try

51:48.320 --> 51:49.960
to compress the database a little bit more,

51:49.960 --> 51:51.880
do some maintenance on it as well.

51:51.880 --> 51:54.440
And I should just say, I'm no matrix admin,

51:54.440 --> 51:56.960
no synapse admin for sure, we're learning as we're going.

51:56.960 --> 51:59.080
And so if there's some essential tips out there

51:59.080 --> 52:01.520
that we've missed for how to keep our database clean

52:01.520 --> 52:03.760
and tidy, we're all ears.

52:03.760 --> 52:04.920
Yeah, let us know.

52:04.920 --> 52:07.160
I think it makes sense to put that database though

52:07.160 --> 52:09.920
on its own disk so it's not taking up space

52:09.920 --> 52:12.280
that the root file system is also sharing.

52:12.280 --> 52:14.680
It's better to have that moved over.

52:14.680 --> 52:17.440
And it also gave us a chance to do all the system updates

52:17.440 --> 52:19.880
and update synapse to the latest version

52:19.880 --> 52:22.360
and get all of that kind of maintenance stuff done.

52:22.360 --> 52:23.960
We're gonna vacuum the database a little bit.

52:23.960 --> 52:27.400
You gotta keep it tidy, re-index things here and there.

52:27.400 --> 52:29.600
And I will say, I mean, there are some,

52:29.600 --> 52:31.240
it does take up some energy,

52:31.240 --> 52:32.520
especially with more users on there.

52:32.520 --> 52:36.040
It does do some work and use Postgres to the max.

52:36.040 --> 52:39.440
But other than that, it really isn't a big deal to run.

52:39.440 --> 52:40.440
I've been very pleased.

52:40.440 --> 52:42.560
All of our updates have been pretty much seamless.

52:42.560 --> 52:44.520
We just go and find the latest release

52:44.520 --> 52:46.480
on their GitHub channel, pull down the new image for that.

52:46.480 --> 52:48.160
And it's been perfect.

52:48.160 --> 52:50.120
Yeah, next week we're gonna say some bad things

52:50.120 --> 52:53.080
about NetData, but this week I'll add

52:53.080 --> 52:54.880
from a positive thing, I'm foreshadowing,

52:54.880 --> 52:56.080
but for this week, I'm gonna say,

52:56.080 --> 52:58.000
NetData has been a nice tool here.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Linode has some built-in alerts, which are nice.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.800
And then NetData has some built-in alerts,

53:01.800 --> 53:03.240
which have been nice to let us know

53:03.240 --> 53:05.320
when we're using a lot of memory,

53:05.320 --> 53:06.480
a synapse is known to do,

53:06.480 --> 53:08.120
or when we've needed to address these issues

53:08.120 --> 53:09.000
and stay on top of it.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.480
And so all in all, even though it's a little memory hungry,

53:12.480 --> 53:14.400
it even was a little memory leaky sometimes,

53:14.400 --> 53:16.880
and it's been very disc hungry.

53:16.880 --> 53:18.600
It's been fairly reliable, I think,

53:18.600 --> 53:20.560
just by throwing some of these tools at it.

53:20.560 --> 53:23.560
And like Wes said, neither one of us are synapse admins,

53:23.560 --> 53:25.840
but we've managed to muddle our way through so far.

53:25.840 --> 53:27.920
And we do love your pro tips.

53:27.920 --> 53:29.640
But you know what, Wes,

53:29.640 --> 53:32.280
speaking of doing a little bit of vacuuming,

53:34.280 --> 53:36.800
let's do some housekeeping here in the show.

53:36.800 --> 53:38.280
I think it's time to clean up a little bit.

53:38.280 --> 53:40.640
First of all, I wanna say thank you to all of our members

53:40.640 --> 53:42.720
over at unpluggedcore.com.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.720
I wanted to mention there is a live stream feed option

53:45.720 --> 53:47.080
for our members.

53:47.080 --> 53:50.000
And some weeks, like some recent weeks,

53:50.000 --> 53:52.840
I felt like some of our best content has been

53:52.840 --> 53:55.600
on the live stream before we've hit record.

53:55.600 --> 53:57.960
Like this episode, I feel like we blew

53:57.960 --> 53:59.360
two really solid pre-shows.

53:59.360 --> 54:02.040
And we haven't even done the post-show yet.

54:02.040 --> 54:04.400
So there's basically an entire additional show's

54:04.400 --> 54:07.000
worth of content for our members at unpluggedcore.com.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.040
We also have the limited ad feed over there.

54:09.040 --> 54:12.480
But in that, you get a tighter version of the show.

54:12.480 --> 54:14.480
So I like to point people to the limited ad feed

54:14.480 --> 54:16.040
if you've got limited time.

54:16.040 --> 54:17.160
Just a little tighter show.

54:17.160 --> 54:19.120
You know, you still get all of Joe's edits

54:19.120 --> 54:20.800
and touch-ups to audio.

54:20.800 --> 54:22.920
Just a tighter production.

54:22.920 --> 54:24.880
The live feed version's like the opposite of that.

54:24.880 --> 54:27.880
It's all of our screw-ups, everything we cut, and more.

54:27.880 --> 54:29.080
And there are plenty.

54:29.080 --> 54:31.880
So you can get that and hear it all

54:31.880 --> 54:34.200
just by going to unpluggedcore.com and becoming a member.

54:34.200 --> 54:36.600
And then you get the warm fuzzies for supporting the show.

54:36.600 --> 54:37.800
You also heard us mention it earlier,

54:37.800 --> 54:40.480
but the Luplug rolls every Sunday.

54:40.480 --> 54:42.200
You can get in our mumble room, hang out in the lobby,

54:42.200 --> 54:43.480
and chat with like-minded folks,

54:43.480 --> 54:46.400
and get details at linuxunplugged.com slash mumble.

54:46.400 --> 54:49.040
It's noon Pacific, and we have the details

54:49.040 --> 54:51.640
at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

54:51.640 --> 54:52.720
in your local time zone.

54:52.720 --> 54:53.960
So you can go over there and get it converted

54:53.960 --> 54:56.120
and then join the Luplug and hang out.

54:56.120 --> 54:57.680
Wes and I are gonna try to pop in there

54:57.680 --> 54:59.160
before land from time to time.

54:59.160 --> 55:01.320
We can't do it every week, but we are gonna try.

55:01.320 --> 55:03.680
Just because it's a lot of fun, honestly.

55:03.680 --> 55:05.320
I mean, if we didn't have a show to record,

55:05.320 --> 55:06.520
that's what we would be doing.

55:06.520 --> 55:07.360
Absolutely.

55:07.360 --> 55:08.440
That's well put.

55:08.440 --> 55:11.000
And it's nice to chat with people and share ideas

55:11.000 --> 55:13.800
and see what people are thinking on and working on.

55:13.800 --> 55:15.680
And that's all every Sunday.

55:15.680 --> 55:17.440
linuxunplugged.com slash mumble for that.

55:17.440 --> 55:18.400
And then once you get it set up,

55:18.400 --> 55:21.520
you can also join the show on Tuesdays when we're live.

55:21.520 --> 55:22.600
So think about that.

55:22.600 --> 55:23.880
Become an internet star.

55:26.240 --> 55:28.480
Before we get out of here this week,

55:28.480 --> 55:32.000
I do have a different kind of pick.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.720
I decided to put this in the pick segment

55:33.720 --> 55:36.080
and not an actual review,

55:36.080 --> 55:41.080
because I only got half a day with this particular pick.

55:41.480 --> 55:43.680
And so I felt like it's more of a,

55:43.680 --> 55:46.440
hey, check this out, but not like a review.

55:46.440 --> 55:48.120
It's got, hey, this has potential,

55:48.120 --> 55:50.960
but I appreciate you sharing the limitations

55:50.960 --> 55:53.160
of what you're about to say and try to convince us of.

55:53.160 --> 55:56.400
Every now and then, Prospector Chris comes out.

55:56.400 --> 55:59.600
Back in my day, there was something called compiz.

55:59.600 --> 56:02.120
And I loved compiz and barrel

56:02.120 --> 56:04.280
and having my windows burn up and-

56:04.280 --> 56:05.640
Wobble to the max.

56:05.640 --> 56:07.960
Wobble to the max, the desktop cube.

56:09.560 --> 56:11.560
I could turn a lot of that on these days in Plasma,

56:11.560 --> 56:12.880
but I don't.

56:12.880 --> 56:17.040
And there was a feel to using compiz, a smoothness,

56:17.040 --> 56:19.160
just this total kind of like

56:19.160 --> 56:21.520
always felt responsive kind of aspect.

56:21.520 --> 56:24.720
And so I wanted to point you over to a project

56:24.720 --> 56:27.040
that's recapturing a lot of that.

56:27.040 --> 56:28.240
It's called Wayfire.

56:28.240 --> 56:31.360
It's a compositor based on WL roots.

56:31.360 --> 56:33.840
And its aim is to create a customizable, extensible,

56:33.840 --> 56:37.800
and lightweight environment without sacrificing appearance.

56:37.800 --> 56:39.320
Oh.

56:39.320 --> 56:41.720
And really it's inspired by compiz.

56:41.720 --> 56:45.400
And it has a lot of that kind of stuff,

56:45.400 --> 56:48.000
especially if you go the easy route like I did,

56:48.880 --> 56:51.800
and you go get Garuda Linux Wayfire edition.

56:51.800 --> 56:53.400
We talked about Garuda Linux recently.

56:53.400 --> 56:55.560
Well, one of the versions they have

56:55.560 --> 56:57.840
is one that uses Wayfire right out of the box.

56:57.840 --> 57:02.640
And they turn it up to 11 as Garuda is to do.

57:02.640 --> 57:05.360
And so like you've got the brain windows

57:05.360 --> 57:08.040
and the spinning desktop cube,

57:08.040 --> 57:10.120
just all that fun stuff.

57:10.120 --> 57:12.080
It's just a lot of fun to play around for a day.

57:12.080 --> 57:13.200
I don't know if you'd want to live there,

57:13.200 --> 57:14.920
but it's a great place to visit.

57:14.920 --> 57:16.400
And so you could go grab Wayfire,

57:16.400 --> 57:17.920
or if you just want to take the easy route,

57:17.920 --> 57:19.320
go get the Garuda Wayfire edition,

57:19.320 --> 57:20.880
which we'll have linked in the show notes.

57:20.880 --> 57:22.760
Dang it, I'm going to have to install this.

57:22.760 --> 57:24.440
Yeah, it just feels like a high performance

57:24.440 --> 57:25.480
desktop environment.

57:25.480 --> 57:29.440
And I think to myself, you know, when this hits 1.0,

57:29.440 --> 57:32.440
maybe I should come real estate shopping.

57:32.440 --> 57:34.000
If you do the Twitter thing,

57:34.000 --> 57:35.920
you can follow this show at Linux Unplugged.

57:35.920 --> 57:37.920
The whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

57:37.920 --> 57:41.000
And of course we have an entire fantastic podcast network

57:41.000 --> 57:43.960
at Jupiterbroadcasting.com with shows like Self Hosted,

57:43.960 --> 57:47.440
Linux Action News, Coder Radio, This Here Program,

57:47.440 --> 57:49.200
and who knows, maybe even more.

57:49.200 --> 57:51.080
And make sure you're catching Linux Action News

57:51.080 --> 57:52.880
because there's stuff going on in the world of Linux

57:52.880 --> 57:53.720
every single week.

57:53.720 --> 57:55.400
And Wes and I break it down for you.

57:55.400 --> 57:58.440
And we put it right there in nice concise packaging

57:58.440 --> 57:59.800
in that Linux Action show.

57:59.800 --> 58:01.840
And then last but not least, I always like to say,

58:01.840 --> 58:03.320
please do consider joining us live

58:03.320 --> 58:06.520
if you ever got a Tuesday where you can stop by

58:06.520 --> 58:09.520
around 12 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

58:09.520 --> 58:10.800
See you next week.

58:10.800 --> 58:13.320
Same bat time, same bat station.

58:13.320 --> 58:15.000
You don't always have to make it to the mumble.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
We got a live stream going.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.920
Some people just sit back and watch the stream.

58:18.920 --> 58:20.520
They don't even get in the chat room.

58:20.520 --> 58:22.120
It happens.

58:22.120 --> 58:23.120
It happens.

58:23.120 --> 58:25.120
But of course we do have that mumble room going.

58:25.120 --> 58:26.480
And you're always welcome to participate

58:26.480 --> 58:28.840
and get your voice on any of the topics right here

58:28.840 --> 58:30.160
in the show.

58:30.160 --> 58:31.160
And to everyone who downloads,

58:31.160 --> 58:32.760
we just want to say thank you very much.

58:32.760 --> 58:33.960
We appreciate you.

58:33.960 --> 58:35.800
And a big shout out to our members.

58:35.800 --> 58:38.560
Thank you so much for making the show possible.

58:38.560 --> 58:40.320
We really do appreciate everyone's support.

58:40.320 --> 58:42.240
And thanks so much for tuning into this week's episode

58:42.240 --> 58:43.360
of the Unplugged program.

58:43.360 --> 58:44.960
Links to everything we talked about today

58:44.960 --> 58:48.440
at linuxunplugged.com slash 424.

58:48.440 --> 58:51.360
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

58:51.360 --> 58:56.840
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

58:56.840 --> 59:21.840
Thank you so much for tuning into Unplugged.

59:21.840 --> 59:36.560
All right, Wes Payne, step up to the plate.

59:36.560 --> 59:37.800
Here I am.

59:37.800 --> 59:41.520
It's another round of can we update our server live on the air

59:41.520 --> 59:58.560
with our crazy arch update contest.

59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.800
I think these clips have gone to your head.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.520
All right, Wes Payne.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.520
How are we doing?

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.760
I know we've got kernel updates.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:06.760
We've got CFS updates.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.320
This is a big one.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:12.000
We are through, we've got a new LTS kernel installed.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:19.000
And we just finished the DKMS rebuild for CFS 2.1.0.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.400
I was secretly hoping you'd already got it installed and rebooted.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.120
I wanted to wait to reboot.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.120
You're saving it for the show.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.880
Plus I want you to be to take the blame when I say can I hit reboot?

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:30.160
The reboot is the worst part of this.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.640
You know, I was just hoping it was over with.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:32.940
All right, I'm getting my ping set up.

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:34.440
Are you ready to reboot?

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:35.440
Yeah.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.440
Okay.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.440
Let's do it.

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.000
It's been closed by remote host.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.440
So long, pigness.

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.440
So long.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.440
It's all right.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.440
It's going to be fine.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.440
It's still pinging.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.440
It's still pinging.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.440
Reboot already.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.440
Come on, machine.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.440
Still going.

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.440
Huh.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.440
You know, it's got to stop all the containers.

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.440
Yeah.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.440
Mm-hmm.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.440
Oh, that one took a...

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.200
It's taking a little bit longer.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.000
It's slightly going up in response time.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Oh.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.400
Is that the last of it?

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.400
I think so.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.400
Uh-oh.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.400
Oh, no.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.000
Okay, here we go.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.560
Now this is where we just wait patiently and I don't panic.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:12.680
That's right.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.800
Who has some good news for Chris?

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.800
Everybody go to jbtitles.com.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:20.760
Get us a good title just in case this doesn't work because we just got this damn server

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.760
working again.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.800
What are we doing, Wes?

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:25.800
Why do we even update at all?

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.520
I mean, I know why.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.080
It's our commitment that we're going to do this rolling thing in public.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.080
And if it goes wrong, it goes wrong in front of everybody and we own it.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.160
Behind the scenes, he's begging me to just let him install Stream on there, but I say

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.160
no.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.160
We promise the audience.

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:43.620
Actually, next week, we are going to let you vote on our future server OS.

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:47.360
So do tune in to next week's episode because we're going to have a poll on what OS we should

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.360
use on our next server.

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:51.300
But that's not yet.

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:53.920
Why would you use anything besides Fedora server though?

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:54.920
It's true, right?

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.240
I mean, you never know.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.520
That thing has been rock solid for me for years.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:04.120
It's insane how smooth their update path is for between operating system releases.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.120
It's still down.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:08.120
But then we'd never be able to talk about it on the show if it's too good.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.120
That's the trick.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.120
Yeah.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:14.080
You got to have every now and then like the genuine tension here is this really could

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.240
go sideways and we really do use this in production.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.960
So it really creates a genuine tension.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.400
And if it never goes sideways, there's no tension.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.400
Oh, God.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.600
And you know, this thing's been so unreliable recently, too.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.160
It's just like, I really feel like we're on the dice.

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.560
The machine is like a decade and a half old.

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:31.560
I know.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.560
We're really trying to get our money out of it.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:36.160
I think you're way past getting your money back on this.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.640
Oh, I think we got a solid plan.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.200
We're going to we're going to unveil the plan next week and we got some good news in that

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.920
department and we'll have the poll.

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:47.760
But I just need this server to make it a few more weeks because we're not there yet.

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.760
Is this when we're going to finally do open SUSE on there?

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.640
I mean, you could go vote when I've released the poll.

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.120
It's not not an option.

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.120
I will.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.120
I will reveal this.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.240
That is an option on the poll.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.240
I will reveal.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:04.120
I won't say what other distros, but that is on there.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.140
So we'll see how people vote.

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:09.440
This is at the point where I I legitimately start to think it's not coming back.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.440
I know.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.540
It's always hard because it takes it takes a long time.

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:13.740
But you think you've waited.

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.600
You know what I'm realizing?

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:19.800
I'm realizing right now this would be another use case for an IPK.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.800
Yeah.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:25.240
If I could pull it up and see that it was doing something or a mic wired out in the

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.240
garage.

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.640
Let's hear the fans spinning up.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.040
Oh, oh, I've got pings.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.040
Oh, I do, too.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.040
Oh, I do, too.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.040
OK.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:35.760
Now, the next step for me is going to be, yeah, does the wire guard tunnel come back

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:36.760
up?

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:37.760
Right.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:38.760
Now, I've got a different back door.

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:39.760
That's how I'm pinging it.

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:40.760
But right.

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:42.440
Thanks, Nebula.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:45.880
My applications are not up at the moment.

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:50.360
So we don't have we don't have container applications yet, which is kind of a bad sign because those

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.360
usually come up pretty quick.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.360
Oh.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.360
Oh.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.360
Oh.

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.360
Oh.

01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.040
I don't think this is good.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.600
Just give it a minute.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.600
Come on.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:02.600
Yeah, just wait.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.600
OK, I'm going to have to say, are you S.S.H.ing in, Wes?

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.600
Yeah, let's get out.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:07.600
Wait, Wes is now panicking.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:08.600
Oh, hey, I got S.S.H.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:09.600
I got S.S.H.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.600
That means wire guard's up.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.600
OK, I do, too.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:12.600
Yeah, I do, too.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.400
But wire guard is in the container app.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.480
OK, I see Docker firing up.

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:17.480
Oh, yeah.

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:18.480
Is your storage up?

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.480
OK.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.480
Hold on.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.680
I think I think we have the containers can start up without storage.

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:23.680
True.

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:24.680
Yes.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.320
We do have storage.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:31.040
All we're waiting for now is for an application to start and actually load.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:37.160
Oh, shoot, Wes, look at that.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.280
Very nice, sir.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.820
It's done.

01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:43.020
Another round of successful Arch updates.

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:58.560
We have a big server update next week, so be sure to tune in for that.
