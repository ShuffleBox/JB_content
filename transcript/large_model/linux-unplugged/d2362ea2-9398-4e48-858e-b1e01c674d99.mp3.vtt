WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
We've been keeping an eye on the Steam Deck, and it seems Valve has updated their Arch

00:07.760 --> 00:10.980
install to be basically fully up-to-date.

00:10.980 --> 00:13.340
They're syncing it up with upstream Arch.

00:13.340 --> 00:15.740
Some people start to speculate it might never happen.

00:15.740 --> 00:18.460
Wait, they're going to do updates, right?

00:18.460 --> 00:19.460
Yeah.

00:19.460 --> 00:21.300
KDE 5.26 is landing in there.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.620
There's new themes and new wallpapers.

00:23.620 --> 00:26.580
That new fancy update to K-Runner.

00:26.580 --> 00:32.320
I wonder, guys, do you think we're getting close to an actual public release of SteamOS

00:32.320 --> 00:33.320
for regular PCs?

00:33.320 --> 00:35.760
Do you think it'll get there before the end of the year?

00:35.760 --> 00:36.760
No.

00:36.760 --> 00:37.760
Really?

00:37.760 --> 00:38.760
Come on.

00:38.760 --> 00:39.760
This is Valve time.

00:39.760 --> 00:40.760
Save it for your prediction, Chris.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.800
I predict it's going to come out before our predictions episode, actually.

00:43.800 --> 00:44.800
Whoa.

00:44.800 --> 00:45.800
Prediction prediction?

00:45.800 --> 00:46.800
Yeah.

00:46.800 --> 00:52.000
I think it's going to come out around Christmas break time for schools and stuff.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.200
What are you basing this on?

00:53.200 --> 00:54.200
Just this one update?

00:54.200 --> 00:57.320
Well, I mean, because why else go through all the trouble of getting everything else

00:57.320 --> 01:01.160
synced up with upstream at this point and not do an update?

01:01.160 --> 01:04.480
Because otherwise, you're going to have to do this all over again before you release.

01:04.480 --> 01:08.880
So you think this is the hurry up, you know, a little quick spit shine and then...

01:08.880 --> 01:09.880
Yeah.

01:09.880 --> 01:14.440
And then they release the public ISO around like a week or two before Christmas and people

01:14.440 --> 01:16.880
that are home for the holidays get to play around with it.

01:16.880 --> 01:21.280
I mean, it's a Valvey kind of thing to do, right?

01:21.280 --> 01:26.840
It's Valvey to me.

01:26.840 --> 01:38.000
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
My name is Chris.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
My name is Wes.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
And my name is Brent.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.920
Well, hello, gentlemen, coming up on the show today.

01:44.920 --> 01:47.760
We're taking a look at Fedora 37.

01:47.760 --> 01:50.000
Is this the one that breaks their streak?

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
We'll chat about that.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.080
Plus, it seems Ubuntu is quietly moving away from ZFS.

01:56.080 --> 01:57.680
We'll see what's going on there.

01:57.680 --> 02:02.520
And then we'll take a test and see if these two can tell the difference between real Chris

02:02.520 --> 02:04.700
and AI generated Chris.

02:04.700 --> 02:08.160
And then we'll round it all out with some great boos, some feedback, some pics, and

02:08.160 --> 02:09.460
a lot more.

02:09.460 --> 02:13.120
So before we go any further, let's say time appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

02:13.120 --> 02:14.120
Hello, Mama Root!

02:14.120 --> 02:15.120
Hi, friends.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.120
Good evening, guys.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.120
Greetings.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.120
Hello.

02:18.120 --> 02:19.120
Hello.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.120
Thank you for being here.

02:20.120 --> 02:21.120
Thank you.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.120
Very nice.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.120
Very nice.

02:23.120 --> 02:24.120
Got a good crew in there.

02:24.120 --> 02:25.120
Good crew up in the quiet listening as well.

02:25.120 --> 02:29.880
I also want to say good morning to our friends over at TailScale, a mesh VPN powered by WireGuard.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.320
It's a game changer.

02:31.320 --> 02:34.800
If you were early to Linux, you remember that time when people didn't know about how great

02:34.800 --> 02:37.840
Linux was and you knew you were onto something great and everybody else hadn't figured it

02:37.840 --> 02:38.840
out yet?

02:38.840 --> 02:40.540
That's how I feel about TailScale.

02:40.540 --> 02:42.600
So go over to TailScale and try it out.

02:42.600 --> 02:43.600
Say good morning.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.480
You get it for free up to 20 devices at TailScale.com.

02:45.480 --> 02:49.720
If you get a chance, tell them the unplugged program sent you.

02:49.720 --> 02:52.080
Wes Payne, you're running Fedora 37 right there.

02:52.080 --> 02:53.080
Of course.

02:53.080 --> 02:54.640
What else would I be running?

02:54.640 --> 02:59.760
I've got Fedora 37 right here on the Dev 1, which has been an interesting journey.

02:59.760 --> 03:00.760
We'll get to that.

03:00.760 --> 03:04.560
And Brentley, you've been running Fedora 37, but a slightly different spin.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.300
You've been using the Plasma Edition.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.840
It's true.

03:07.840 --> 03:08.840
I assume you went GNOME.

03:08.840 --> 03:09.840
Oh, yeah.

03:09.840 --> 03:10.840
Yeah.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.640
So Wes and I went GNOME, and Brentley went the Plasma Edition.

03:13.640 --> 03:17.720
Well, he protests when we make him use GNOME, so it's just simpler this way for everyone.

03:17.720 --> 03:18.720
He needed a break.

03:18.720 --> 03:23.680
And honestly, we need to try to represent the Plasma users out there that are considering

03:23.680 --> 03:28.440
these updates, because I realized we kind of had a blind spot with the Ubuntu Mate spin.

03:28.440 --> 03:33.200
We just really focused on the main Ubuntu release, and sometimes the spins have something

03:33.200 --> 03:34.200
really great in there.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.200
True.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.200
True.

03:36.200 --> 03:39.520
So Fedora 37 was pretty delayed.

03:39.520 --> 03:43.620
I don't think they like that term, because they basically have a window.

03:43.620 --> 03:45.080
It spans several weeks.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.640
It's ready when it's ready.

03:46.640 --> 03:52.080
And in this case, things got delayed by a flaw in OpenSSL.

03:52.080 --> 03:57.680
So the Fedora team decided to delay the release, so that way they could fix that and get the

03:57.680 --> 03:58.800
updated package in there.

03:58.800 --> 03:59.800
And so it pushed it.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.120
We're like slow sockets.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.560
Super slow, right?

04:04.560 --> 04:07.600
It pushed it to this week, as this episode is coming out.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.600
What?

04:08.600 --> 04:09.600
Is it like Wednesday?

04:09.600 --> 04:10.600
I don't know.

04:10.600 --> 04:11.860
The ISOs are final.

04:11.860 --> 04:15.000
And we've been kicking the tires throughout the entire beta process, and then we kind

04:15.000 --> 04:18.960
of go in deep in this last week or so.

04:18.960 --> 04:26.160
Fedora 37, I'd say off the top, is a tricky blank canvas to talk about.

04:26.160 --> 04:31.480
This is hard to review, because quite frankly, not a lot going on in here, but there's some

04:31.480 --> 04:32.480
good bones.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.200
It is a showcase for GNOME 43.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.200
Yeah.

04:36.200 --> 04:40.200
It's been a little bit since I used like super up-to-date GNOME.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.200
Ooh.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.200
Ooh.

04:42.200 --> 04:43.200
This is...

04:43.200 --> 04:44.200
It just feels solid.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.000
Everything is snappy AF.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
It's just...

04:47.000 --> 04:49.580
It feels like a very first-class desktop.

04:49.580 --> 04:53.880
It's got that new quick settings menu, which I love, and that's been super handy.

04:53.880 --> 04:58.520
And then several iterations now really all come together in the GNOME system settings,

04:58.520 --> 05:00.920
where there's just a bunch of good new stuff in there.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.600
And like you said, this is GTK 4.

05:03.600 --> 05:08.800
We're doing a lot of video acceleration now there for that stuff when we can.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.680
And they also shipped Raspberry Pi 4 support.

05:12.680 --> 05:16.560
Fortunately, every time I went to test that, there were issues with the images either not

05:16.560 --> 05:17.840
being available or whatever.

05:17.840 --> 05:21.180
Which happens as we try to pre-review a release.

05:21.180 --> 05:23.860
But I will give it a go when I can.

05:23.860 --> 05:28.960
My take is a little darker, a little sadder, a little more disappointed than it normally

05:28.960 --> 05:29.960
is.

05:29.960 --> 05:34.840
I think really since Fedora 32, I've been coming on here after a Fedora release, and

05:34.840 --> 05:39.020
I've been saying, this is probably worth updating to.

05:39.020 --> 05:46.120
And I cannot really articulate a reason to upgrade to Fedora 37 outside of the update

05:46.120 --> 05:47.680
to GNOME 43.

05:47.680 --> 05:51.200
And that's even with a pretty big caveat, because if you've got a good GNOME setup right

05:51.200 --> 05:56.840
now on 35 or 36, and you've got extensions you like, I'd just stick there for a while

05:56.840 --> 06:00.080
because most of my extensions broke.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.080
Very few of them are working at this point.

06:02.080 --> 06:07.240
So I don't have some basic things like status menu icons and things like that.

06:07.240 --> 06:11.520
So I really am not really a big fan of this release, because it felt like they took it

06:11.520 --> 06:13.160
more than they gave it in some regards.

06:13.160 --> 06:18.880
This is the release where we lose hardware video acceleration for H.264 and some other

06:18.880 --> 06:20.120
codecs.

06:20.120 --> 06:24.640
And unfortunately, the change to remove the flat hub filtering doesn't land in 37.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.720
It's been postponed to 38.

06:26.720 --> 06:33.800
So the software situation in this release of Fedora is a major step back.

06:33.800 --> 06:40.680
And it makes the software ecosystem on Ubuntu with PPAs and deb files and snaps seem simple

06:40.680 --> 06:42.920
compared to what Fedora offers now.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.140
I had a horrendous experience.

06:45.140 --> 06:50.580
It was just a huge hot mess, because I went to go set up my machine and I searched for

06:50.580 --> 06:53.600
Slack and I got nothing in GNOME software.

06:53.600 --> 07:01.520
And I searched for Telegram and I got a GNOME web link that it would install for me.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.520
I closed the application.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.000
This is, mind you, days after I've been using it.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.960
It's not like the first time I ran GNOME software.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.840
I closed the application, I relaunched it again.

07:08.840 --> 07:14.360
This time I do the same search and I get a flat hub result.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.760
Totally different set of results.

07:16.760 --> 07:21.440
And it's just really just confusing, because the icons are missing, they don't have the

07:21.440 --> 07:25.320
right vendor icons, it's not clear who published it, it's hard to trust if any of it's legit

07:25.320 --> 07:29.960
when I just searched a minute ago and got a web link.

07:29.960 --> 07:34.120
And now I get an application, but the application's missing the icon and I can't tell who the

07:34.120 --> 07:36.500
publisher is.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.320
And this is just a hot mess of software.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.200
And there's some things that are on flat hub that I search for that I can't get really

07:41.200 --> 07:45.420
common stuff, really basic stuff that you'd want to get off of flat hub that are just

07:45.420 --> 07:47.960
not available in GNOME software.

07:47.960 --> 07:55.660
And then they've chosen to partake in parts of RPM Fusion, but not all of RPM Fusion.

07:55.660 --> 08:00.740
So for some reason I can install the NVIDIA proprietary driver from RPM Fusion, but nothing

08:00.740 --> 08:02.200
else works.

08:02.200 --> 08:09.020
And for some reason that's okay, but yet raw access to flat hub has to be protected.

08:09.020 --> 08:11.720
So why can't we just set up all of RPM Fusion or all of flat hub?

08:11.720 --> 08:17.280
And if they're working on a proposal to bring all of flat hub unfiltered to Fedora 38, why

08:17.280 --> 08:18.920
can't I have RPM Fusion too?

08:18.920 --> 08:20.540
What's the difference?

08:20.540 --> 08:21.680
There is no difference.

08:21.680 --> 08:27.880
The difference is, and you can see it in their discussion thread, the legal team just tells

08:27.880 --> 08:28.880
them no.

08:28.880 --> 08:31.080
Nope, you can do flat hub, but you can't do RPM Fusion.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.080
Why?

08:32.080 --> 08:33.360
We can't tell you.

08:33.360 --> 08:40.240
And it's another example of how this distribution gets jerked around by lawyers at IBM that

08:40.240 --> 08:43.680
decide what features can and cannot ship in Fedora.

08:43.680 --> 08:48.100
And it's really disappointing because it affects even this experience of using software, not

08:48.100 --> 08:50.700
to mention the issue we have with video codecs.

08:50.700 --> 08:54.980
So the software situation is just sort of this result of the Fedora project has been

08:54.980 --> 08:56.220
making transitions.

08:56.220 --> 08:59.120
There's been a focus on flat packs.

08:59.120 --> 09:03.700
There has been a discussion internally if they should be using their own flat pack repo

09:03.700 --> 09:07.580
and then putting that in front of flat hub and then defaulting after that to flat hub

09:07.580 --> 09:08.580
and then after that to RPMs.

09:08.580 --> 09:09.860
And they've been sorting this whole thing out.

09:09.860 --> 09:12.260
They couldn't get it figured out in time for release.

09:12.260 --> 09:17.740
And the end result is it's a mess and it's just not a good experience as an end user.

09:17.740 --> 09:23.960
And it's really frustrating because between the video codecs missing and this software

09:23.960 --> 09:30.300
experience being so subpar, it feels like we just took five, six years back in terms

09:30.300 --> 09:31.300
of usability there.

09:31.300 --> 09:34.040
And that's my downside with it.

09:34.040 --> 09:39.200
The upside is that it is a great blank slate in which you can build a fantastic workstation

09:39.200 --> 09:40.340
on.

09:40.340 --> 09:42.280
And so I'm curious if you guys got to that point.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.280
How far did you make it?

09:43.280 --> 09:49.340
Yeah, I mean, I just sort of, I think you're right, the flat hub stuff is confusing, especially

09:49.340 --> 09:53.540
if you want to come in for a, like, I just expect this to work.

09:53.540 --> 09:57.340
I sort of assumed I would just have to, like I do on most places, end up having to like

09:57.340 --> 10:02.640
get maybe flat pack itself going, but at least flat hub, you know, as a repository enabled.

10:02.640 --> 10:06.300
So once I was over that hurdle, it kind of got, you know, working pretty well.

10:06.300 --> 10:10.980
I was actually outside of the initial setup problems, I was kind of surprised by how few

10:10.980 --> 10:13.340
problems I had with GNOME software these days.

10:13.340 --> 10:17.260
Like it feels way faster than it used to feel, like I can switch back and forth, it finds

10:17.260 --> 10:19.060
the search goes pretty quick.

10:19.060 --> 10:21.540
I still love the integration with the various parts of my system.

10:21.540 --> 10:27.340
It feels like a nice, I don't know if I, I don't think I've installed any software on

10:27.340 --> 10:30.060
the command line this time around, which is not my normal go to.

10:30.060 --> 10:33.140
I mean, I just pop up a terminal most times because I'm lazy and I know how to do it that

10:33.140 --> 10:34.140
way.

10:34.140 --> 10:38.000
I was also, I continue to be pleased with just as everything keeps getting updated and

10:38.000 --> 10:42.060
revved in the last couple Fedora releases, it feels like more and more of the little

10:42.060 --> 10:44.660
edge cases have been worked out.

10:44.660 --> 10:47.940
Like I think like where Pipewire and some of the GNOME plumbing and just on the desktop

10:47.940 --> 10:51.180
as a whole feels, feels really nice.

10:51.180 --> 10:53.620
Like Pulse, who cares anymore?

10:53.620 --> 10:57.220
Like I just, this stuff works so well, I, it feels, I don't feel limited.

10:57.220 --> 11:00.820
There was a time where I was like, Fedora, could I make it like a, like a creator space

11:00.820 --> 11:04.700
for me that felt like maybe there's some hurdles, but with Pipewire, like there's a ton of stuff

11:04.700 --> 11:10.180
in the repos, like Helvam, the Rust GTK patch bay thing that lets you, you know, drag inputs

11:10.180 --> 11:13.380
and outputs around that works with Pipewire, packaged in Fedora.

11:13.380 --> 11:16.740
And if it's packaged in Fedora, like, you know, it's, it's, it's recent, it's new.

11:16.740 --> 11:18.220
Like I don't have to complain about it.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.220
So that made it.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.340
That does, that does make it nice as a workstation.

11:21.340 --> 11:22.340
Yeah.

11:22.340 --> 11:25.820
So once I got over a little bit and, you know, I had to go remind myself, how do I get Nick's

11:25.820 --> 11:29.780
packages going on Fedora without disabling SC Linux and some of that, you know, so there's

11:29.780 --> 11:30.780
a couple of things.

11:30.780 --> 11:32.740
But once I got all the initial setup, you're right.

11:32.740 --> 11:37.660
Like I like the system, everything feels real solid, you know, they've got system D tuned

11:37.660 --> 11:38.660
really nicely.

11:38.660 --> 11:42.940
They've got the desktop plumbed really nicely, up-to-date software.

11:42.940 --> 11:46.080
So yeah, I don't know if the hurdle, there's more hurdles now, I guess.

11:46.080 --> 11:50.900
But if you are an experienced user, you probably expect that already.

11:50.900 --> 11:56.060
I think Fedora 37 benefits from years of good choices under the hood.

11:56.060 --> 11:58.180
And so there's a lot there to work with.

11:58.180 --> 12:01.820
I'll talk more about how sometimes it doesn't always come together in the end, but I wanted

12:01.820 --> 12:06.860
to ask you, did you end up getting Nick's packages working on Fedora 37 or are you using

12:06.860 --> 12:08.260
that to manage software right now?

12:08.260 --> 12:11.180
Yeah, I didn't do, I just wanted to see, you know, go through the process.

12:11.180 --> 12:13.980
I didn't install a bunch of stuff through Nick's or anything.

12:13.980 --> 12:17.580
Mostly I'd mostly have flat packs on this because I've been using it as a, you know,

12:17.580 --> 12:20.340
casual desktop, getting a little bit of work done here and there.

12:20.340 --> 12:25.500
I think the one thing I installed, VS code just as a raw dog RPM, actually, because I

12:25.500 --> 12:29.620
don't know, sometimes the flat pack doesn't feel worth it for that one, just because if

12:29.620 --> 12:33.340
you want to dump a bunch of runtimes on your system with that layer is sometimes more trouble

12:33.340 --> 12:34.340
than it's worth.

12:34.340 --> 12:37.540
But other than that, it's been flat packs in the repo and, you know, I just wanted to

12:37.540 --> 12:40.380
play around with Nick's because these days I just install it everywhere.

12:40.380 --> 12:43.220
So you enabled flat hub, just full flat hub.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.220
I tried it at first.

12:44.220 --> 12:46.640
I was like, oh, this is not getting me the results I want.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.980
And I figured on most, you know, some desktops, like you got to install flat pack itself

12:49.980 --> 12:51.700
first and then enable flat hub.

12:51.700 --> 12:53.940
So by comparison, yeah, it's quicker.

12:53.940 --> 12:57.300
And they have a Fedora specific section on the site and you can just download the repo

12:57.300 --> 12:59.780
thing and it installs it graphically.

12:59.780 --> 13:05.160
I took it on as a challenge to not add the full RPM fusion repo or flat hub repo for

13:05.160 --> 13:09.220
a while just to see what that experience was, to see what they were shipping.

13:09.220 --> 13:15.860
And it's not great because if you do want to get to that stuff, if there's no instructions

13:15.860 --> 13:19.420
on how to actually officially do it, so one of the things you got to do is just follow

13:19.420 --> 13:23.420
some random instructions on Reddit that tell you to install these packages from RPM fusion

13:23.420 --> 13:26.300
and supposedly they'll add hardware accelerated decoding back.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.900
But it's like, which Reddit thread do you pick?

13:28.900 --> 13:32.860
I mean, I picked the one I picked, I'll put in the show notes, but I can't believe as

13:32.860 --> 13:36.400
a Fedora user, that's what I'm being reduced to is finding random Reddit threads.

13:36.400 --> 13:42.140
But I did notice there was a codec section at the G streamer one in the store.

13:42.140 --> 13:45.580
I don't know if that's only there if you enable third party repositories at the install.

13:45.580 --> 13:46.660
But yeah, I think so.

13:46.660 --> 13:50.620
But the nice thing is also is it will take you there when you go to when you first go

13:50.620 --> 13:51.620
to play.

13:51.620 --> 13:54.580
So I'll walk you through the scenario because here's the here's the scenario I recreated

13:54.580 --> 13:58.860
and then I want to hear Brent's plasma experience, but the scenario I created is I filmed a video

13:58.860 --> 14:01.740
on my phone and then I took that video.

14:01.740 --> 14:02.740
Was it a Levi video?

14:02.740 --> 14:03.740
Of course.

14:03.740 --> 14:04.740
Okay.

14:04.740 --> 14:08.420
I took that video and I put it on my laptop and I wanted to watch the video on my laptop.

14:08.420 --> 14:10.460
It's 2022.

14:10.460 --> 14:12.460
Everybody has a smartphone with a camera.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.860
All of those cameras are recording in HD 64.

14:14.860 --> 14:16.180
It transferred to my laptop.

14:16.180 --> 14:18.220
It does not play.

14:18.220 --> 14:19.220
That's a failure.

14:19.220 --> 14:24.420
However, it does then walk you through the process of searching Gnome software.

14:24.420 --> 14:28.140
And if you have the third party repos installed, you can install the G streamer codec that

14:28.140 --> 14:30.100
has HD 64 playback.

14:30.100 --> 14:35.980
I don't believe it's hardware accelerated because I got a I got a dev one here and I

14:35.980 --> 14:42.740
was like pegging out like 40 50 percent watching a video from my phone.

14:42.740 --> 14:45.240
But it installs it and then it begins playing immediately.

14:45.240 --> 14:49.340
It's even a slightly smoother than it used to be back in the old days when I used to

14:49.340 --> 14:53.660
buy my fluendo codecs and then add them back when we used to not have codecs on Linux.

14:53.660 --> 14:54.940
It's a little bit smoother than that.

14:54.940 --> 14:55.940
I had to.

14:55.940 --> 14:56.940
I don't know if it was a flu.

14:56.940 --> 14:57.940
I already had it open.

14:57.940 --> 14:58.940
I had to restart Firefox to get it.

14:58.940 --> 14:59.940
Hmm.

14:59.940 --> 15:00.940
I just installed it right now as we're doing it.

15:00.940 --> 15:01.940
Yeah.

15:01.940 --> 15:02.940
Yeah.

15:02.940 --> 15:03.940
Yeah.

15:03.940 --> 15:04.940
But after that, I mean, yeah, watching Jupiter Tube.

15:04.940 --> 15:05.940
So.

15:05.940 --> 15:06.940
Right.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.380
So, Brantley, I want to hear about your experience.

15:08.380 --> 15:09.380
I know you tried plasma.

15:09.380 --> 15:11.520
I don't know if any of this stuff bit you.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.620
If maybe you're sticking with Fedora 37.

15:13.620 --> 15:15.220
How'd it go, sir?

15:15.220 --> 15:16.220
Yeah.

15:16.220 --> 15:20.180
Well, one of our parameters that we kind of toyed with was not changing any of the repos,

15:20.180 --> 15:21.760
not adding flathood, things like that.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.740
So I thought that's a great challenge.

15:23.740 --> 15:28.660
But then I kind of suffered for it.

15:28.660 --> 15:30.980
So I had a quite a hard time.

15:30.980 --> 15:31.980
Yeah.

15:31.980 --> 15:37.060
I actually really suffered with that and I didn't expect that because I was just trying

15:37.060 --> 15:41.660
to do really simple stuff like I wasn't able to find VLC.

15:41.660 --> 15:42.660
I don't know.

15:42.660 --> 15:43.660
Maybe I'm broken.

15:43.660 --> 15:48.180
I couldn't find it anywhere to install, which seems odd.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.220
I don't know why that is.

15:50.220 --> 15:56.140
But to test the video playing, like you mentioned, Chris, I installed MPV and it must have taken

15:56.140 --> 16:02.860
care of everything because H264 played just fine for me, actually, which was good.

16:02.860 --> 16:07.980
But I just ran into a whole bunch of issues even from the very beginning, which was unfortunate.

16:07.980 --> 16:12.220
I was really looking forward to having a great experience.

16:12.220 --> 16:16.500
And some of it was like a day or two before those official releases were out.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.820
Some of it was after and just continued, which is sort of unfortunate.

16:19.820 --> 16:25.160
So one of the main things I ran into, well, I guess I should give some stats first.

16:25.160 --> 16:30.560
So it was running Plasma 5.262 as far as I can find.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.940
The latest is 5.263.

16:32.940 --> 16:34.020
So pretty darn recent.

16:34.020 --> 16:37.640
I think 5.263 just got released on the 8th.

16:37.640 --> 16:38.640
So a few days ago.

16:38.640 --> 16:45.780
But I ran into some issues that have sort of been my experience with KD the last six

16:45.780 --> 16:50.580
months on various OSes, unfortunately.

16:50.580 --> 16:56.760
So one of the main ones was that the lock screen after being suspended, when you try

16:56.760 --> 16:59.520
to wake it up, was just a complete mess of distortion.

16:59.520 --> 17:04.020
And Chris, I included a few screenshots for you in our doc there so that you could kind

17:04.020 --> 17:06.060
of have a look at them.

17:06.060 --> 17:08.140
And it was bizarre because the mouse pointer was perfectly fine.

17:08.140 --> 17:11.500
But everything else was like this jarble mess.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.020
I was able to find a workaround.

17:13.020 --> 17:19.720
So I was able to use the old control alt F1 and F2 and F3 to kind of bounce between terminals

17:19.720 --> 17:22.740
and get back to the screen.

17:22.740 --> 17:24.940
And then it's presented just fine.

17:24.940 --> 17:26.940
So that was an interesting experience.

17:26.940 --> 17:33.700
And it just kind of persisted between restarts and was unfortunate.

17:33.700 --> 17:40.180
And I had just application crashes out of nowhere and some notifications that came up

17:40.180 --> 17:42.660
immediately just suggesting that things were broken.

17:42.660 --> 17:47.260
And so I actually didn't get very far before losing all of my enthusiasm.

17:47.260 --> 17:49.980
And that got me thinking about spins in a bigger context.

17:49.980 --> 17:56.180
And I feel like the main release, especially with their release window, tends to focus

17:56.180 --> 18:00.940
on the GNOME implementation, which is logical.

18:00.940 --> 18:04.220
But it gets me thinking about spins and how they're at kind of the mercy of that release

18:04.220 --> 18:05.220
cycle.

18:05.220 --> 18:08.020
And sometimes they have to release maybe when they're not quite ready.

18:08.020 --> 18:11.100
I would be interested in knowing a little bit more about how that works on the back

18:11.100 --> 18:12.100
end.

18:12.100 --> 18:16.580
But I feel like using the spins on release day is just rough, really, really rough.

18:16.580 --> 18:20.900
Maybe it's better in a month or two, and I'd be interested in looking at that.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.980
I don't disagree with you on that.

18:22.980 --> 18:29.180
I know that Neil would tell us that the Fedora project has made critical bugs in Plasma a

18:29.180 --> 18:31.940
release blocker for all the spins.

18:31.940 --> 18:35.580
But my experience has also just been that it doesn't have the same focus.

18:35.580 --> 18:39.340
I think that probably could be a topic we could dig down on in the future.

18:39.340 --> 18:40.340
You mentioned errors.

18:40.340 --> 18:42.540
Do you think they were SE Linux errors that you were getting?

18:42.540 --> 18:44.660
No, they weren't SE Linux errors.

18:44.660 --> 18:50.980
I think I meant to screen grab them, and then I had the other issues and just they got lost

18:50.980 --> 18:51.980
in the mix.

18:51.980 --> 18:53.580
But yeah, I can't speak to them.

18:53.580 --> 18:56.380
Maybe I'll have another look and find them.

18:56.380 --> 19:02.380
But they didn't seem to affect at least what I can tell, the operation of the OS, it seemed

19:02.380 --> 19:03.380
just fine.

19:03.380 --> 19:05.940
Might have been a notification subsystem error.

19:05.940 --> 19:09.060
Hey, I'll take viewer notifications as a good thing.

19:09.060 --> 19:13.660
Yeah, you still want to get the important ones though, don't you?

19:13.660 --> 19:20.060
This is an interesting sort of pause in what has been, in my opinion, really strong releases,

19:20.060 --> 19:23.860
especially starting at 32 and 33 when ButterFS came in.

19:23.860 --> 19:26.140
And I think it's still a really solid base.

19:26.140 --> 19:28.300
I don't know if it's worth upgrading today.

19:28.300 --> 19:32.500
I'd probably, if it was me, I'd probably wait a month or two at least.

19:32.500 --> 19:39.940
Unfortunately, sort of ironically timed, after the show today, I am playing tech support

19:39.940 --> 19:41.420
for my son.

19:41.420 --> 19:46.540
I installed Fedora 36 on his Asus laptop.

19:46.540 --> 19:50.380
It's been working great for a long time.

19:50.380 --> 19:55.620
Until about a month or two ago, and it started to just slowly have issue after issue.

19:55.620 --> 20:01.060
One of the first problems that crept up was his Nvidia binary driver just broke.

20:01.060 --> 20:03.980
It seems to almost segfault during boot or something, and then the nouveau driver has

20:03.980 --> 20:04.980
to load.

20:04.980 --> 20:06.420
So it does fall back.

20:06.420 --> 20:08.860
It's not like it totally fails to come up.

20:08.860 --> 20:11.620
But he uses it to game, so it's kind of a downside.

20:11.620 --> 20:15.340
So then it starts up and you're like, wait, why is my gaming suddenly way worse?

20:15.340 --> 20:16.340
Yeah.

20:16.340 --> 20:20.940
And of course he's always paying attention to the frames per second and whatnot.

20:20.940 --> 20:26.520
So this weekend, this is on Fedora 36, I just took all the Nvidia stuff off, went totally

20:26.520 --> 20:30.700
back to a free driver stack, completely back to stock.

20:30.700 --> 20:34.100
And then went into GNOME software, made sure I had the repos enabled and all that kind

20:34.100 --> 20:39.820
of stuff, and reinstalled it from following their prescribed process, and I'm still having

20:39.820 --> 20:40.820
issues with it.

20:40.820 --> 20:46.920
But on top of that, when he shuts down now, it hangs at like KVM trying to do some sort

20:46.920 --> 20:49.520
of KVM hardware shutdown process.

20:49.520 --> 20:53.580
And his system just hangs there forever, and he has to hard physically turn it off.

20:53.580 --> 20:56.820
And of course, he's doing that more and more, because it also doesn't sleep anymore when

20:56.820 --> 20:58.140
he closes the lid.

20:58.140 --> 21:02.820
It did when he first started using it, but it no longer does.

21:02.820 --> 21:07.740
And this morning, I found out that now some sort of process in the background is just

21:07.740 --> 21:09.100
going absolutely crazy.

21:09.100 --> 21:12.540
I would not be surprised if it isn't related to KVM.

21:12.540 --> 21:16.860
And his fans are going crazy, his CPU is getting pegged.

21:16.860 --> 21:23.540
It just seems to me that Fedora 36 just didn't turn out to be as durable as I wanted, because

21:23.540 --> 21:28.100
he only installs stuff from Steam, and he just does the system updates.

21:28.100 --> 21:30.020
That's all he's doing.

21:30.020 --> 21:34.900
And he had elementary OS for like three years, and it was fine.

21:34.900 --> 21:37.660
We just moved because it was an old base, and he was getting a new machine.

21:37.660 --> 21:41.540
And at the time, I was like, Fedora seems to be working really well.

21:41.540 --> 21:46.080
But I'm concerned about this durability issue, because I'm not really clear what he's done

21:46.080 --> 21:51.940
other than, I've looked at it, it's just updates, and things broke.

21:51.940 --> 21:55.420
And I think that means it's probably not going to be the family OS for me.

21:55.420 --> 21:59.540
And I really hate that, because I like just that clean blank slate that I can build a

21:59.540 --> 22:00.540
little family setup on.

22:00.540 --> 22:04.260
I mean, obviously, like, right, there's LTS, there's lots of options here, but it felt

22:04.260 --> 22:09.980
like in a certain stride, like the updates, the update process itself, just everything

22:09.980 --> 22:13.780
kind of coming together, reaching a very cohesive whole, like that even though, yes, there are

22:13.780 --> 22:17.420
more updates in the Fedora model, you can still feel kind of comfortable being like...

22:17.420 --> 22:21.980
You know, I'm glad you brought that up, because I say elementary OS was fine, but we were

22:21.980 --> 22:25.460
starting to have packages that were like...

22:25.460 --> 22:28.660
You can no longer get an updated enough version from the repo to support this.

22:28.660 --> 22:33.080
Or like a repo was no longer online, because it was like a, you know, probably a four-year-old

22:33.080 --> 22:34.080
distro by that point.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.080
Yeah.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.080
Was that the 1804?

22:36.080 --> 22:37.080
Probably.

22:37.080 --> 22:41.100
Yeah, it was probably the 1804 base, and it was about a year ago.

22:41.100 --> 22:43.220
And everything still installs, right?

22:43.220 --> 22:47.860
DNF completes, everything's good, every package is still working, all the dependencies are

22:47.860 --> 22:51.900
resolved, there's nothing broken in regards to like package management, which is honestly

22:51.900 --> 22:55.020
what I was trying to solve for, because I was very frustrated, because ultimately what

22:55.020 --> 22:58.740
happened to elementary OS, I couldn't update Chrome, he couldn't use something he needed

22:58.740 --> 23:00.700
for school, blah, blah, blah.

23:00.700 --> 23:01.700
Right.

23:01.700 --> 23:04.540
One too many PPAs, some weird stuff happened, who knows anymore.

23:04.540 --> 23:05.540
Yeah.

23:05.540 --> 23:09.900
I solved for that with Fedora, and it's working well, but it's just disappointed me in this

23:09.900 --> 23:10.900
way.

23:10.900 --> 23:17.300
My exit interview for Fedora 36 is, if you're a sysadmin, you're set, it's going to be fine,

23:17.300 --> 23:21.540
but I can't recommend it for the set-it-and-forget-it-family type computers, because it has not been that,

23:21.540 --> 23:26.840
and this has not been problem-free the entire install, about once every couple of months

23:26.840 --> 23:31.980
I'm fixing something for them, you know, two or three times, not the end of the world,

23:31.980 --> 23:35.340
but it's also, I think, honestly it shook his confidence a little bit in desktop Linux

23:35.340 --> 23:39.700
as a result, which is kind of, which was not great, you know, because we were doing really

23:39.700 --> 23:45.940
good, but when he sees the frame rate drop, and you know, he's having issues with it not

23:45.940 --> 23:49.700
shutting down, and he closes the lid, puts it in his bag, and he pulls it out, it's like

23:49.700 --> 23:55.720
110 degrees, and the battery's drained, you know, that's a bad experience.

23:55.720 --> 23:59.380
And now if I were to put Fedora 37 on there, and not set it up for him, you know, if he

23:59.380 --> 24:05.540
were to just try upgrading to fix it, he would upgrade, and he would lose video accelerated

24:05.540 --> 24:11.260
playback, and he has an AMD graphics in there too, he's got both, and that's just, that's

24:11.260 --> 24:12.260
a hard sell.

24:12.260 --> 24:15.220
I mean, could you imagine trying to tell him that?

24:15.220 --> 24:16.900
How do I even explain that to him?

24:16.900 --> 24:19.700
I don't think you would, you'd probably just end up in stock, you know, tell him I gotta

24:19.700 --> 24:24.300
do a couple maintenance upgrades real quick before you use this, bud.

24:24.300 --> 24:28.400
Now I have a question for you both, or maybe it's more of a pondering.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.940
We've seen some of the major distributions, like Fedora for instance, we were excited

24:31.940 --> 24:37.180
about it for a long time, and now it seems maybe this one's a slump for a little bit.

24:37.180 --> 24:42.780
But we saw the exact same thing with Ubuntu in recent years, kind of some maybe less exciting

24:42.780 --> 24:46.860
releases, and it seems maybe they're on an uptrend now for us.

24:46.860 --> 24:50.740
In that context, how do we choose, well I'm gonna make it personal, how do we choose an

24:50.740 --> 24:56.260
OS for my dev one, because I need something and I'm finding it really difficult, you know,

24:56.260 --> 25:01.620
in the shoes of a listener to just say, well, what does JB recommend as the OS that I should

25:01.620 --> 25:03.020
run for the next year or two?

25:03.020 --> 25:06.620
God, it really comes back to like, what problem do you want to solve for?

25:06.620 --> 25:12.060
Because in a real way, the problem I was trying to solve with Dylan's laptop was system updates

25:12.060 --> 25:17.860
that worked every time and didn't break, and I was sick of fixing a broken app to install,

25:17.860 --> 25:21.980
that if you run an Ubuntu install long enough, eventually just doing updates, something breaks

25:21.980 --> 25:22.980
to install, right?

25:22.980 --> 25:27.580
It just happens, at least on all of mine it has over time, and it happened on his, and

25:27.580 --> 25:28.580
I was solving for that.

25:28.580 --> 25:31.020
So it's like, what problem are you willing to put up with?

25:31.020 --> 25:35.300
And then there's this other element that I don't think we talk about, but it matters

25:35.300 --> 25:38.940
a lot, and it's what's the corporate influence?

25:38.940 --> 25:44.860
Because a lot of what we're complaining about today is not really because of a technical

25:44.860 --> 25:47.080
issue, it's because of legal issues.

25:47.080 --> 25:50.980
So what is the corporate governance look like, and what do the corporate politics look like?

25:50.980 --> 25:54.600
And that's a whole other element you have to consider too, if you really get into it,

25:54.600 --> 25:58.260
and I don't know how you explain that to people, and it's gonna be different at different thresholds

25:58.260 --> 26:01.320
and different preferences for each individual.

26:01.320 --> 26:07.020
So I think the option is, is distro hop for a while.

26:07.020 --> 26:10.440
I think that's why distro hopping is so popular, it's why it's such a meme.

26:10.440 --> 26:13.740
I'm not convinced that solves it, because you could try one version and have a terrible

26:13.740 --> 26:17.500
experience six months later, have a great experience on the very same distro.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.500
I don't know, is that true though?

26:18.500 --> 26:22.740
I mean, I think that's true for people trying it, but I don't know, I think you either have

26:22.740 --> 26:27.580
to be willing to accept what you get, or be hands-on in the Linux world.

26:27.580 --> 26:31.260
You know, either you can't be that picky, and you gotta just take what the LTS gives

26:31.260 --> 26:36.580
you and realize sometimes you're gonna get old, slow stuff, or you're gonna be running

26:36.580 --> 26:40.920
something like Fedora or Arch, because you know how to take backups, or know how to roll

26:40.920 --> 26:44.820
back software, or how to deal with the paper cuts that come.

26:44.820 --> 26:49.140
I mean, maybe not, but that's usually the way I end up, as an extremely jaded, using

26:49.140 --> 26:52.940
Linux for way too long person, is how I end up kind of approaching it.

26:52.940 --> 26:56.620
Like either this is a kiosk, or it's somewhere that I fiddle.

26:56.620 --> 26:57.620
Right.

26:57.620 --> 27:02.420
It's a tinker toy, or it's an appliance, or another way people like to put it is a pet,

27:02.420 --> 27:03.860
or it's cattle.

27:03.860 --> 27:07.740
I think what it is, is when you pick a Linux distro, it's what set of problems do you want

27:07.740 --> 27:09.480
to solve for?

27:09.480 --> 27:15.380
And Fedora has, I think, in whole, when you look at all the different distro options,

27:15.380 --> 27:19.620
a pretty good understandable set of compromises.

27:19.620 --> 27:24.180
NixOS is the one that seems to be kind of hitting my sweet spot right now.

27:24.180 --> 27:27.980
Yeah, I was just waiting for that.

27:27.980 --> 27:33.460
But there's another set of compromises there, and that is complexity in installing software,

27:33.460 --> 27:37.420
and just a new paradigm that you kind of have to wrap your head around.

27:37.420 --> 27:40.740
And there's just sometimes an extra step or two.

27:40.740 --> 27:44.480
Like I downloaded a piece of software the other day, it was actually the first time

27:44.480 --> 27:49.580
I, this sounds weird, but the first time I ever tried an app image on my NixOS desktop,

27:49.580 --> 27:52.300
I just don't really use app images that much.

27:52.300 --> 27:55.620
No offense, but just don't really use them that much.

27:55.620 --> 28:02.540
And I discovered there's an app image run package in Nix that essentially creates the

28:02.540 --> 28:06.260
necessary environment for an app image to run successfully, and then lets you execute

28:06.260 --> 28:07.660
the app image.

28:07.660 --> 28:11.300
It meant I don't just download an app image and double click it.

28:11.300 --> 28:14.900
And it meant that when I double clicked it, because I was curious what would happen, and

28:14.900 --> 28:22.740
nothing happened, like my response can't be, well this damn thing, it has to be, all right,

28:22.740 --> 28:26.580
well let's go Google this, because that's what I'm gonna be doing for a few minutes.

28:26.580 --> 28:29.020
And usually the solution can be found in a few minutes.

28:29.020 --> 28:31.520
And that's a different set of compromises.

28:31.520 --> 28:36.200
But those are the ones I'm living with right now.

28:36.200 --> 28:39.420
That's the real, that's the success to Linux.

28:39.420 --> 28:45.100
Well, it is nice, I think, at least too, that we can, you know, distro hopping is something

28:45.100 --> 28:46.100
that does work.

28:46.100 --> 28:47.100
Yeah.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.740
So you can have backup, you can dual boot if you like, you know, find one OS that you

28:49.740 --> 28:55.060
really like for X activity and want some other LTS setup for, you know, this workflow doesn't

28:55.060 --> 28:58.580
change a lot, and I just don't want to ever have to mess with it again.

28:58.580 --> 29:03.900
And since so many of our tools, especially with flatbacks and app images and containers,

29:03.900 --> 29:04.900
you can bring them with you.

29:04.900 --> 29:06.820
And you got the choice.

29:06.820 --> 29:11.580
And if one distro maker chooses to do something that bugs you, there's several other ones

29:11.580 --> 29:12.780
you can try.

29:12.780 --> 29:16.940
There's always Arch.

29:16.940 --> 29:18.540
lino.com slash unplugged.

29:18.540 --> 29:21.460
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

29:21.460 --> 29:24.780
It's a great way to support the show while you're checking out fast and reliable cloud

29:24.780 --> 29:25.780
hosting.

29:25.780 --> 29:30.980
The best in the business with real human beings behind the support number and a solid Linux

29:30.980 --> 29:32.420
infrastructure.

29:32.420 --> 29:37.420
Over 11 data centers today, right, but they're working on another dozen for next year and

29:37.420 --> 29:42.020
a whole new concept for a micro data center, too, which I'm sure we'll talk about at some

29:42.020 --> 29:43.340
point.

29:43.340 --> 29:47.180
Everything we've built for the last couple of years, we've built it on Linode, in part

29:47.180 --> 29:52.100
because it's great pricing, 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers out there.

29:52.100 --> 29:54.180
But also the performance is better.

29:54.180 --> 29:57.540
It's not just me saying that there's been benchmarks out there, but I've also just tested

29:57.540 --> 29:58.540
it.

29:58.540 --> 30:03.420
And it really is just truly great for the price and the performance and the mix of machine

30:03.420 --> 30:05.820
that you can build.

30:05.820 --> 30:07.100
Nobody gets it.

30:07.100 --> 30:08.100
Nobody gets it like Linode.

30:08.100 --> 30:11.020
And you know, they've been at it for like 19 years practically.

30:11.020 --> 30:13.300
So that's kind of why they've really dialed it in.

30:13.300 --> 30:19.100
And I bet some of you are thinking about potentially setting up your own presence in the Fediverse,

30:19.100 --> 30:23.820
maybe deploying a matrix server or a mastodon server.

30:23.820 --> 30:28.140
Linode's got a guide on how to set up mastodon on Linode in a way that's going to work perfect

30:28.140 --> 30:29.140
for you.

30:29.140 --> 30:34.460
And what I love about this guide is they actually make it available for one, two, three, four

30:34.460 --> 30:36.460
different distributions.

30:36.460 --> 30:39.620
I'll link to the Ubuntu 2004 one.

30:39.620 --> 30:40.620
I don't know.

30:40.620 --> 30:44.820
Personally, for myself, I think that's, I'd probably be considering CentOS Stream.

30:44.820 --> 30:45.980
They have a guide for that as well.

30:45.980 --> 30:47.700
That's what I love about Linode.

30:47.700 --> 30:49.060
They're really distro agnostic.

30:49.060 --> 30:52.820
Whichever distro is going to work best for you, they're going to try to work with that.

30:52.820 --> 30:55.460
And if you ever get stuck, they got the best support in the business.

30:55.460 --> 31:00.620
It's available 365, seven days a week.

31:00.620 --> 31:03.420
I think it's probably the best out there.

31:03.420 --> 31:06.460
Nobody else has built that because nobody else had to compete at that level.

31:06.460 --> 31:11.580
And when you get that $100 by going to linode.com slash unplugged, you can actually try out the

31:11.580 --> 31:14.060
different features of Linode and see why we love it so much.

31:14.060 --> 31:19.540
See why we deploy stuff on there all the time and honestly, the one way you can really,

31:19.540 --> 31:24.460
one of the ways, not the one way, but one of the ways you can really tell that we trust

31:24.460 --> 31:30.360
Linode is when we do live things like deep fusion image generation or, or SSHing into

31:30.360 --> 31:35.320
a box publicly and having everyone on a live stream try to figure out how we broke Docker.

31:35.320 --> 31:39.900
We always do those events on Linode hardware because it's the only thing that holds up

31:39.900 --> 31:41.080
to it.

31:41.080 --> 31:44.540
And it just, it's so impressive every single time.

31:44.540 --> 31:48.780
So go try it, support the show, build something or learn something.

31:48.780 --> 31:52.180
It's a great platform for learning things as well.

31:52.180 --> 31:57.020
Linode.com slash unplugged, get the hundred dollars, try it out and support the show.

31:57.020 --> 32:03.900
Linode.com slash unplugged.

32:03.900 --> 32:06.220
We got some baller boosts this week to support the show.

32:06.220 --> 32:11.660
Wise Papa John came in with our first big boost, 40,000 SATs.

32:11.660 --> 32:15.660
Keep the change, you filthy animal.

32:15.660 --> 32:21.760
Here's 40,000 for a hard G in GIF.

32:21.760 --> 32:25.220
And also Matrix can be a little intimidating for new users.

32:25.220 --> 32:32.020
I feel something that's like more mainstream type social apps, AKA Mastodon, might make

32:32.020 --> 32:35.780
the audience interaction a little more approachable for the newbies.

32:35.780 --> 32:39.000
It also could be another way to discover old show topics.

32:39.000 --> 32:44.780
I'm thinking a social media post for each new episode with a comments thread and whatnot.

32:44.780 --> 32:49.800
Yeah, this Mastodon topic is going to come up again today later in the show.

32:49.800 --> 32:55.580
It's a big hot topic right now because as we record this episode, Twitter is a fiasco.

32:55.580 --> 32:57.180
People are trying out Mastodon in numbers.

32:57.180 --> 32:59.460
It's a whole Pandora's Zoo, not just a class.

32:59.460 --> 33:00.460
Yeah.

33:00.460 --> 33:02.860
Pandora's Zoo is a good way to put it.

33:02.860 --> 33:06.300
And so I've noticed that the podcasting 2.0 show does this.

33:06.300 --> 33:09.300
They do a Mastodon post as a comments thread section.

33:09.300 --> 33:12.740
Oh yeah, sure.

33:12.740 --> 33:16.940
We could probably talk to Alex Gates, the podcasting 2.0 consultant on Office Hours

33:16.940 --> 33:24.860
more about this, but there is also work on cross podcasting app comments using Activity

33:24.860 --> 33:25.860
Pub.

33:25.860 --> 33:26.860
I like that.

33:26.860 --> 33:27.860
That sounds like a nice idea.

33:27.860 --> 33:28.860
Yeah.

33:28.860 --> 33:32.900
So they could be like part of the Federation, which I think would be really cool.

33:32.900 --> 33:38.220
So we'll keep an eye on that development and maybe that kind of stuff could pull us in

33:38.220 --> 33:44.860
or maybe I should just start using my Mastodon account on the podcasting 2.0 social thing.

33:44.860 --> 33:45.860
I mean, I could.

33:45.860 --> 33:46.860
I don't know.

33:46.860 --> 33:50.020
This has worked so well for me because I can dip in and dip out, but I realize that's the

33:50.020 --> 33:52.540
exact opposite for some people.

33:52.540 --> 33:55.300
They don't want something that's moving all the time.

33:55.300 --> 33:56.300
Me I just dip in.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.300
Yeah.

33:57.300 --> 34:01.340
Sometimes you feel real chatty or broadcasty and you want to follow up on what's been going

34:01.340 --> 34:02.340
on.

34:02.340 --> 34:03.340
Some days you don't.

34:03.340 --> 34:04.340
But I gets it.

34:04.340 --> 34:05.340
I gets it.

34:05.340 --> 34:11.140
And then we got another baller boost from John A. He's back.

34:11.140 --> 34:16.740
Twenty five thousand sats and he says, I'm back, baby.

34:16.740 --> 34:17.740
Yes, you are, John.

34:17.740 --> 34:18.740
It's nice to see you again.

34:18.740 --> 34:19.740
Thank you for the support.

34:19.740 --> 34:23.700
I hope you can make it over here before the snow gets too high.

34:23.700 --> 34:27.300
It's going to be tricky over those passes soon.

34:27.300 --> 34:34.060
I also want to mention that the baller support has really been great for the show in terms

34:34.060 --> 34:35.060
of discovery.

34:35.060 --> 34:39.900
We've got new listeners that find us because your boost put us high on the fountain charts

34:39.900 --> 34:46.260
and pretty neat is I have a call scheduled with some of the fountain FM leadership on

34:46.260 --> 34:51.340
Tuesday next week because they've noticed we're so frequently on the top boosted charts

34:51.340 --> 34:52.900
and they're like, well, we got to talk to Chris more.

34:52.900 --> 34:53.900
That's wonderful.

34:53.900 --> 34:56.260
So I'm going to take some feedback that I've been hearing from the audience and talk with

34:56.260 --> 34:57.260
them about it.

34:57.260 --> 35:03.540
But, you know, as a podcaster that does this for a living where my actual livelihood depends

35:03.540 --> 35:09.580
on this, having these channels of communications with the app developers are kind of really

35:09.580 --> 35:10.780
important and critical.

35:10.780 --> 35:13.580
And so your boost put us up on those charts.

35:13.580 --> 35:16.980
We had new audience find us and the developers of Fountain FM.

35:16.980 --> 35:19.100
We got their attention too.

35:19.100 --> 35:22.540
And now we're going to have an ongoing dialogue with them thanks to your support and the boosts.

35:22.540 --> 35:25.060
I really just I really love how it's working.

35:25.060 --> 35:26.060
I really appreciate it.

35:26.060 --> 35:28.860
So it's like a little audience vouch, you know?

35:28.860 --> 35:29.860
Yeah.

35:29.860 --> 35:30.860
Yeah.

35:30.860 --> 35:31.860
Yeah.

35:31.860 --> 35:32.860
It's a real clear signal is what it is.

35:32.860 --> 35:37.420
It's better than any algorithm that the platform maker could come up with.

35:37.420 --> 35:38.420
It's better than upvotes.

35:38.420 --> 35:39.420
Yeah, upvotes are cheap.

35:39.420 --> 35:40.420
Yeah.

35:40.420 --> 35:41.420
Yeah.

35:41.420 --> 35:43.420
It's better than a thumbs up or a retweet.

35:43.420 --> 35:48.180
It's a real signal because people use their stats and it's a data point of enthusiasm

35:48.180 --> 35:50.420
and people take note.

35:50.420 --> 35:51.700
It's really cool.

35:51.700 --> 35:53.020
And we appreciate it.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.260
The stats are cheap.

35:54.260 --> 35:56.000
They'll probably be cheap for a while.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.820
Don't buy a bunch, but just grab a handful and send them our way with a new podcast app

35:59.820 --> 36:00.820
at newpodcastapps.com.

36:00.820 --> 36:10.060
I wanted to follow up on a couple of items and one that just I haven't really seen much

36:10.060 --> 36:16.620
discussion and it's kind of been developing I think for about a year and I've been hoping

36:16.620 --> 36:23.180
that we'd get some sort of official announcement from Canonical on the state of ZFS in Ubuntu

36:23.180 --> 36:28.260
because it seems that they are transitioning away from some of the tooling that they have

36:28.260 --> 36:33.560
created to manage ZFS, specifically the ZSYS tooling.

36:33.560 --> 36:37.660
And it's even kind of in a deprecated, barely maintained state.

36:37.660 --> 36:43.740
There's even potentially some bugs that are impacting data and it doesn't really seem

36:43.740 --> 36:48.780
advisable to continue to use ZSYS with ZFS on Ubuntu.

36:48.780 --> 36:52.380
I don't know what it means for the long-term ZFS on Ubuntu in general.

36:52.380 --> 36:54.980
Wes, I know you sniffed around a little bit.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.540
Can you kind of summarize what you found?

36:56.540 --> 37:03.300
Yeah, it just seems like internally at least at Canonical there's no longer a lot of prioritization

37:03.300 --> 37:04.300
around ZSYS.

37:04.300 --> 37:07.340
So it hasn't had any active development.

37:07.340 --> 37:11.700
And then people started noticing that there'd been various issues in launchpads suggesting

37:11.700 --> 37:13.380
like, well, we're not working on this.

37:13.380 --> 37:15.920
We're still installing it with the installer.

37:15.920 --> 37:17.580
We should probably update this.

37:17.580 --> 37:18.580
We should clean this up.

37:18.580 --> 37:21.420
If we're not going to be maintaining it, then we probably shouldn't be installing it.

37:21.420 --> 37:26.460
So it doesn't seem like there's any indication of so far anything changing in terms of shipping

37:26.460 --> 37:30.980
the ZFS pre-compiled module, keeping that in sync with the kernels they deliver, all

37:30.980 --> 37:34.740
of that good stuff we had since 2016.

37:34.740 --> 37:40.340
But in terms of their more ambitious sort of, you know, deeply integrating ZFS with

37:40.340 --> 37:46.860
the desktop experience, with the, you know, base underpinnings of the system, not a bright

37:46.860 --> 37:49.700
future there, at least at the moment would be my guess.

37:49.700 --> 37:54.140
Yeah, it seems that the team has just been reprioritized, right?

37:54.140 --> 37:58.220
They're focused on other things and this tooling just isn't a big priority.

37:58.220 --> 38:01.560
But it's funny because these things come triumphantly, right?

38:01.560 --> 38:05.980
We get this big triumphant introduction of a feature set and it's really cool and we

38:05.980 --> 38:06.980
talk about it.

38:06.980 --> 38:11.660
And then sometimes things change and they just quietly fade away.

38:11.660 --> 38:16.700
And it seems like no one's really been working on this since, you know, late 2021.

38:16.700 --> 38:20.220
And there's just been a couple of wham bam fixes to just kind of cram into the installer.

38:20.220 --> 38:25.420
Now, like you say, there's a Launchpad ticket right here to just remove ZSYS from the installer

38:25.420 --> 38:27.420
altogether.

38:27.420 --> 38:30.180
That feels like a downgrade to me.

38:30.180 --> 38:35.740
And I wonder what your opinion is, is in terms of, well, they should have gone with Butter

38:35.740 --> 38:38.460
FS because that was the first thing I thought of.

38:38.460 --> 38:43.700
Not just because of the kernel module stuff and the licensing stuff, but to me it felt

38:43.700 --> 38:49.620
like if Fedora and Ubuntu were working on tooling together around Butter FS and SUSE's

38:49.620 --> 38:54.780
out there working on tooling around Butter FS and we have these three large distro makers

38:54.780 --> 38:57.700
that just standardized on Butter FS.

38:57.700 --> 39:02.540
Not only would that likely help us improve Butter FS even further, but then if one of

39:02.540 --> 39:06.380
them faded, we still have other vendors in the mix.

39:06.380 --> 39:14.460
But now what we have is we have Ubuntu with ZFS with tooling that's just kind of being

39:14.460 --> 39:15.460
deprecated.

39:15.460 --> 39:21.140
We've got SUSE that's doing their own thing integrated with their own package installer

39:21.140 --> 39:24.360
with their own setup on Butter FS, which is probably the most mature.

39:24.360 --> 39:30.460
And then we've got Fedora that's moved the ball forward since 33, but not significantly.

39:30.460 --> 39:34.740
We're not seeing after you complete a DNF install snapshots that you can then go boot

39:34.740 --> 39:37.900
from grub or anything like that, which it clearly could be if they continue to iterate

39:37.900 --> 39:38.900
on it.

39:38.900 --> 39:43.340
We've just got three different kind of hodgepodge with open SUSE in the best condition.

39:43.340 --> 39:47.980
And I just look at this whole thing and I go, well, you know, when they announced this,

39:47.980 --> 39:51.380
my first thought was, boy, it'd be great if they all just went in on Butter FS.

39:51.380 --> 39:56.660
And now we're at the end where they're apparently deprecating ZSYS and my thought is, God, it

39:56.660 --> 39:58.500
would have been great if they just would have gone with Butter FS.

39:58.500 --> 40:02.540
Yeah, but I mean, does that ever, does it ever work that way, right?

40:02.540 --> 40:06.660
ZFS is kind of their sauce, their thing that they know they can bring that other distros

40:06.660 --> 40:07.660
can't or won't.

40:07.660 --> 40:12.060
Plus, I mean, we know, not necessarily in a bad way, they've made some very nice tools

40:12.060 --> 40:16.700
that I like a lot, but Canonical has a particular way that they build tooling and approach and

40:16.700 --> 40:18.500
tool chains that they want to use, right?

40:18.500 --> 40:21.500
They've got people who know how to use, you know, they seem to use Go a lot for a lot

40:21.500 --> 40:23.980
of these tools, but they've got, you know, particular ways to go about and build these

40:23.980 --> 40:24.980
things.

40:24.980 --> 40:29.420
To me, it just makes me think it's kind of that ebb and flow we see, you know, at a time,

40:29.420 --> 40:32.900
maybe there's a little more interest in some of this like enterprise-y desktop and that

40:32.900 --> 40:36.860
space and maybe that's just kind of faded a bit recently.

40:36.860 --> 40:42.540
Well, you know how I found out about this is if you ask the folks at the OpenZFS project,

40:42.540 --> 40:44.580
they'll just tell you to just avoid Ubuntu now.

40:44.580 --> 40:49.220
And they have on their front page like news about, at least they did this weekend, news

40:49.220 --> 40:52.380
about how this is being deprecated and don't use it.

40:52.380 --> 40:56.500
It doesn't seem like that's in a good place, that relationship, that doesn't seem like

40:56.500 --> 41:01.620
a healthy thing because when you have like the upstream project saying, oh yeah, just

41:01.620 --> 41:05.020
don't use Ubuntu, even though they're still shipping the kernel module, that's the...

41:05.020 --> 41:07.180
It should be probably one of the better experiences, yeah.

41:07.180 --> 41:08.980
I think it actually is.

41:08.980 --> 41:09.980
Yeah.

41:09.980 --> 41:12.540
I don't know, man.

41:12.540 --> 41:19.220
We'll have links to the Launchpad issue as well as the issue on the ZSYS project itself

41:19.220 --> 41:24.580
where the user ran into a data loss bug, but I want to do another follow-up story.

41:24.580 --> 41:28.060
I'd be curious to know what the audience thinks and what their experiences with ZFS there

41:28.060 --> 41:33.980
and honestly, if anybody's impacted by the deprecation of the ZSYS tooling, did that

41:33.980 --> 41:35.340
really take off?

41:35.340 --> 41:36.340
Maybe that's an element.

41:36.340 --> 41:37.340
Yeah.

41:37.340 --> 41:39.860
Maybe it just got really low adoption or something.

41:39.860 --> 41:41.260
I don't know if they could measure that.

41:41.260 --> 41:45.300
I did see some folks in the various like discourses and stuff wondering like, what are the KPIs

41:45.300 --> 41:46.300
you want to see?

41:46.300 --> 41:48.100
How do we tell you if some people really like this?

41:48.100 --> 41:50.540
I don't know if we have a clear signal on that.

41:50.540 --> 41:52.300
Yeah, that could be part of it too.

41:52.300 --> 41:57.020
Well, send us some signal if you have an opinion out there, dear audience.

41:57.020 --> 42:02.580
And then I want to go back to the topic of these deep fusion generated images and deep

42:02.580 --> 42:04.340
fake audio.

42:04.340 --> 42:12.860
Listener CB had a lot of fun generating some images that are creepy, eerie, close to me.

42:12.860 --> 42:18.980
Like the first one in this album that I'll link to in the show notes, I think if I sent

42:18.980 --> 42:22.740
that to you, you would think that actually was me writing a penguin.

42:22.740 --> 42:23.740
Totally would.

42:23.740 --> 42:26.220
I'm disappointed it wasn't you.

42:26.220 --> 42:28.440
There's me talking to a penguin.

42:28.440 --> 42:31.620
There's also me watching myself on the screen.

42:31.620 --> 42:32.620
That also happens.

42:32.620 --> 42:33.620
Yeah.

42:33.620 --> 42:34.620
Very, very interesting stuff.

42:34.620 --> 42:37.180
But of course, this here is an audio podcast.

42:37.180 --> 42:42.580
And Listener CB generated something that is pretty close to the real thing.

42:42.580 --> 42:46.200
So are you ready to hear what the current state of deep fake Chris after it's been trained

42:46.200 --> 42:47.200
on our podcast sounds like?

42:47.200 --> 42:48.200
Heck yes.

42:48.200 --> 42:49.200
All right.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.620
Listener Chris decided to create a virtual Chris efficient.

42:51.620 --> 42:52.620
So I'm going forward.

42:52.620 --> 42:54.420
I do not need to do these podcasts anymore.

42:54.420 --> 42:56.500
And I can just go on vacation to relax.

42:56.500 --> 42:58.980
Ah, I mean, you kind of understand it, right?

42:58.980 --> 42:59.980
Yeah.

42:59.980 --> 43:01.700
You listen to him for a few seconds.

43:01.700 --> 43:02.940
It starts to make sense.

43:02.940 --> 43:06.140
That vacation they may become in their West kind of sounds like a Chris Fisher on his

43:06.140 --> 43:08.380
like third podcast of the day.

43:08.380 --> 43:09.380
Yeah.

43:09.380 --> 43:13.460
You know, I thought you're gonna say yeah, drink of the day, you know, that's also the

43:13.460 --> 43:14.460
third drink.

43:14.460 --> 43:16.740
I mean, what are you doing to show that?

43:16.740 --> 43:18.180
Come on.

43:18.180 --> 43:23.740
And then here CB sent in what he believes is the value for value exchange for this experiment

43:23.740 --> 43:24.740
he engaged in.

43:24.740 --> 43:29.060
So I need to acknowledge some value that a listener send in over and down.

43:29.060 --> 43:31.620
Listener Chris had prayed something fakes him.

43:31.620 --> 43:37.900
And I just want to say that his contribution is worth more than 900,000 boosted sets.

43:37.900 --> 43:39.280
Over 9000.

43:39.280 --> 43:42.220
It's obviously a little rough.

43:42.220 --> 43:44.620
But what about in a year, right?

43:44.620 --> 43:45.620
What about even in a year?

43:45.620 --> 43:49.220
Isn't that something a little more effort, you know, get some more build a bigger, bigger

43:49.220 --> 43:50.220
data set.

43:50.220 --> 43:53.100
I'm going to play the first one again.

43:53.100 --> 43:57.500
And I think it does actually capture some of my tone.

43:57.500 --> 44:00.300
For this, I had to create a virtual Chris Fisher.

44:00.300 --> 44:03.120
So going forward, I do not need to do these podcasts anymore.

44:03.120 --> 44:06.220
And I can just go on vacation to relax.

44:06.220 --> 44:08.180
Isn't that remarkable?

44:08.180 --> 44:09.180
That's a lot of fun.

44:09.180 --> 44:11.340
I would let that guy like guide me through a phone tree.

44:11.340 --> 44:12.700
Yeah, you could totally see that.

44:12.700 --> 44:13.700
Welcome to you.

44:13.700 --> 44:14.700
But I'm wrong.

44:14.700 --> 44:15.700
Yeah.

44:15.700 --> 44:19.980
Press one like a version where you get Linux action news, but you have to call a hotline.

44:19.980 --> 44:23.420
Like like telephone banking, but it's telephone Linux news.

44:23.420 --> 44:24.420
Yeah.

44:24.420 --> 44:25.420
Exactly.

44:25.420 --> 44:26.420
Member special.

44:26.420 --> 44:27.420
Yeah.

44:27.420 --> 44:28.420
Yeah.

44:28.420 --> 44:29.420
Enter your member code.

44:29.420 --> 44:33.980
I'll you guys will have to if you I mean, if you care, you'll have to look at that handsome

44:33.980 --> 44:34.980
gentleman.

44:34.980 --> 44:38.340
I know some of the images that generated are really something.

44:38.340 --> 44:41.520
Me talking to penguins is a theme, which is great.

44:41.520 --> 44:46.800
One thing that I do really appreciate about the AI is that it the one thing it really

44:46.800 --> 44:50.420
honed in on is consistent is where I'm overweight.

44:50.420 --> 44:55.660
But to the hair, the hair, right, the hair is consistently good.

44:55.660 --> 44:58.560
It really it really does that quite well.

44:58.560 --> 45:01.180
Also you could learn a couple of styling tips from AI Chris, I think.

45:01.180 --> 45:06.820
I am also I was just going to say I look good in a military uniform like this is the right

45:06.820 --> 45:07.820
look for me.

45:07.820 --> 45:08.820
Hoodie.

45:08.820 --> 45:09.820
Not so great.

45:09.820 --> 45:11.780
Military uniform.

45:11.780 --> 45:13.500
Editor in chief or commander in chief.

45:13.500 --> 45:15.500
Yeah, I guess my I guess my uniform left.

45:15.500 --> 45:17.740
I've been lurking on building a personal uniform.

45:17.740 --> 45:22.500
I'm going to have to just go for like the you know, like the actual like military style,

45:22.500 --> 45:23.500
you know, because that looks good.

45:23.500 --> 45:24.500
It looks good.

45:24.500 --> 45:28.380
Yeah, I feel like I want to set up another one of these deep fusion instances.

45:28.380 --> 45:29.380
Oh, yeah.

45:29.380 --> 45:30.380
We're not.

45:30.380 --> 45:31.380
We're not.

45:31.380 --> 45:32.380
It's too much fun.

45:32.380 --> 45:33.380
It was a lot of fun.

45:33.380 --> 45:34.900
It was a lot of fun for screwing around.

45:34.900 --> 45:38.620
We use it for just low key stuff like over at Jupiter dot tube.

45:38.620 --> 45:43.340
All of the you know, instead of doing like silly YouTube thumbnails, we just generate

45:43.340 --> 45:45.340
a silly AI image.

45:45.340 --> 45:46.340
Why not?

45:46.340 --> 45:50.580
It's been working pretty good.

45:50.580 --> 45:54.620
Bitwarden dot com slash Linux go there right now to get started with a free trial for a

45:54.620 --> 46:00.180
team or an enterprise or try it as an individual by going to Bitwarden dot com slash Linux.

46:00.180 --> 46:05.340
I haven't mentioned this before, but enterprise plans include complementary family plans.

46:05.340 --> 46:09.740
So that's a great way to extend security not only to your entire organization, but also

46:09.740 --> 46:12.820
to your team members, your coworkers at home.

46:12.820 --> 46:16.100
So if you haven't advocated for Bitwarden at your organization yet, that might be a

46:16.100 --> 46:19.300
great direction to go and send them to Bitwarden dot com slash Linux.

46:19.300 --> 46:22.980
It's the easiest way to store, share and sync your sensitive data.

46:22.980 --> 46:24.260
And Bitwarden is open source.

46:24.260 --> 46:26.100
It's trusted by millions of us in the community.

46:26.100 --> 46:28.300
It's what Wes and I use all the time.

46:28.300 --> 46:32.340
I'm using it now for my two factor codes as well, which makes that so much more reliable

46:32.340 --> 46:34.780
for me, especially the way I move machines.

46:34.780 --> 46:38.620
You can use it for other sensitive data, too, like account recovery keys or other types

46:38.620 --> 46:43.820
of secrets that either want to store in one secure central place that you can trust or

46:43.820 --> 46:47.400
also something maybe like a secret you might need to share with a team member or a friend

46:47.400 --> 46:50.380
or a family member at some point or a spouse.

46:50.380 --> 46:56.440
Bitwarden is fantastic for that while not messing up your whole OPSEC, as they say.

46:56.440 --> 47:01.060
And the mobile clients have made it really feasible to have secure passwords, unique

47:01.060 --> 47:07.660
user names and unique email addresses for every site, service or even app you use, which

47:07.660 --> 47:13.340
is fantastic since I'm moving between my desktop and my mobile devices all the time.

47:13.340 --> 47:17.140
And Bitwarden is rolling out features every single month, including they just recently

47:17.140 --> 47:22.940
rolled out DuckDuckGo email aliasing, support for fast mails, email alias, password protected

47:22.940 --> 47:24.700
encrypted exports.

47:24.700 --> 47:27.020
I love to see them working more with DuckDuckGo, too.

47:27.020 --> 47:29.620
I think that's a real positive sign.

47:29.620 --> 47:34.500
So go try it out for free right now by going to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

47:34.500 --> 47:39.460
You sign up there or if you've already taken care of this, and I hope you have because

47:39.460 --> 47:44.900
a password manager and something like Bitwarden that can help you store your secrets and all

47:44.900 --> 47:50.420
your sensitive data very securely that you can trust, that's just an absolute critical

47:50.420 --> 47:52.400
tool for staying safe and secure online.

47:52.400 --> 47:53.460
So I hope you already know about this.

47:53.460 --> 47:57.540
You probably do, but I bet you have a friend or a family member.

47:57.540 --> 47:58.540
Maybe it's Brent.

47:58.540 --> 47:59.540
Maybe it's somewhere you work.

47:59.540 --> 48:00.580
I don't know.

48:00.580 --> 48:01.580
Maybe they need a little convincing.

48:01.580 --> 48:05.500
So have them go try it, bitwarden.com slash Linux.

48:05.500 --> 48:06.500
It's good for you.

48:06.500 --> 48:07.500
It's good for the internet.

48:07.500 --> 48:14.740
It's true, too, bitwarden.com slash Linux.

48:14.740 --> 48:18.540
As always, we got some great feedback this week, but we do have a special little something

48:18.540 --> 48:20.020
from listener Jeff.

48:20.020 --> 48:23.580
Let's just call it a geocache update for the Folsom location.

48:23.580 --> 48:27.300
Captain, I am on location at the Sacramento geocache.

48:27.300 --> 48:28.300
It is missing.

48:28.300 --> 48:29.700
I repeat, missing.

48:29.700 --> 48:31.160
Abort the search.

48:31.160 --> 48:32.580
It is no longer here.

48:32.580 --> 48:34.300
It has been found.

48:34.300 --> 48:35.300
Data conclusive.

48:35.300 --> 48:39.100
Thank you, Jeff.

48:39.100 --> 48:43.940
So of course, for those of you who just need to be caught up is Chris was right all along.

48:43.940 --> 48:49.460
Folsom was one of our first successful, maybe the second successful geocache that was found

48:49.460 --> 48:50.720
by an audience member.

48:50.720 --> 48:52.380
That's clearly what happened.

48:52.380 --> 49:00.580
And Jeff went on location to verify and he confirmed via visual data that the Folsom

49:00.580 --> 49:05.460
Linux Unplugged cache has been discovered, like I knew all along.

49:05.460 --> 49:06.460
Like I knew all along.

49:06.460 --> 49:10.260
But there was kind of another kind of funny coincidence while he was there, Brent.

49:10.260 --> 49:14.980
Yeah, he ran into listener Jared again and his family, and that's the second time that

49:14.980 --> 49:18.620
happens at that particular location, which I think is super fun.

49:18.620 --> 49:20.060
That is so great.

49:20.060 --> 49:25.780
Jeff mentioned that listener Jared's daughter, I think, or son ran up one of the kids.

49:25.780 --> 49:28.260
Are you looking for the JB geocache?

49:28.260 --> 49:31.100
That's adorable.

49:31.100 --> 49:32.940
Second time that happens.

49:32.940 --> 49:33.940
So good.

49:33.940 --> 49:36.740
I mean, if you're going to meet strangers in the woods, I would hope they're fans.

49:36.740 --> 49:38.260
I think we got to do more of these.

49:38.260 --> 49:41.060
We should have given Jeff a geocache.

49:41.060 --> 49:42.060
We need it.

49:42.060 --> 49:47.660
You know, oh, oh, what we need are geocache bundles that we can mail out to listeners

49:47.660 --> 49:49.460
that they could stash in their general area.

49:49.460 --> 49:50.460
Now you're talking.

49:50.460 --> 49:51.460
That's what we need to do.

49:51.460 --> 49:54.740
I bet the listeners will be way better at hiding geocaches than we are.

49:54.740 --> 49:55.740
Yeah.

49:55.740 --> 50:00.460
So what we could do is we could have somebody email into the show and let us know if you

50:00.460 --> 50:01.460
want to do this.

50:01.460 --> 50:02.460
See if anybody's interested.

50:02.460 --> 50:05.500
And what we could do is we'd basically send you a little Tupperware container full of

50:05.500 --> 50:11.820
swag that you hide in your area, then you've got to send us video of you like kind of in

50:11.820 --> 50:12.820
the area hiding it.

50:12.820 --> 50:14.260
But we don't want to give away the location exactly.

50:14.260 --> 50:17.060
So you just give us a little narration of where it's at.

50:17.060 --> 50:19.140
You know, this is what you'd have to do if you want to participate in it.

50:19.140 --> 50:21.620
So that way we can play the clip to give people a hint.

50:21.620 --> 50:23.180
Got to craft your clue.

50:23.180 --> 50:26.700
You got to craft a clue and then let us know.

50:26.700 --> 50:27.700
And we could send a few of these out.

50:27.700 --> 50:28.700
I think.

50:28.700 --> 50:31.380
Oh, it's great to know I was right about the Folsom cache.

50:31.380 --> 50:32.380
That's good.

50:32.380 --> 50:33.380
That's good.

50:33.380 --> 50:35.580
We got some mail this week.

50:35.580 --> 50:41.140
Benjamin wrote in about Jupiter.tube and I think he's looking for some peers.

50:41.140 --> 50:46.340
He writes, for me over here in the UK, I rarely see more than two peers, usually one and I

50:46.340 --> 50:52.620
get about 15k down if I'm lucky during live streams.

50:52.620 --> 50:58.500
So it's usually a two seconds of video playback, a minute or so of buffering and just repeat

50:58.500 --> 50:59.500
that cycle.

50:59.500 --> 51:04.740
None of the other RTMP, RTSP or radio streams seem to work for me either.

51:04.740 --> 51:08.060
So I rely on the YouTube streams for the most part.

51:08.060 --> 51:12.020
I can, however, watch the published stream the next day without any problems from Jupiter

51:12.020 --> 51:13.020
Tube.

51:13.020 --> 51:14.500
So just not when it's live.

51:14.500 --> 51:16.740
Well, now that is interesting.

51:16.740 --> 51:17.740
Yeah.

51:17.740 --> 51:18.740
Strange.

51:18.740 --> 51:19.740
Now that's a curveball.

51:19.740 --> 51:21.740
You're able to pull data from that server.

51:21.740 --> 51:24.100
How does that make any sense?

51:24.100 --> 51:27.260
Because when it's live, it's doing a web torrent from that server anyways.

51:27.260 --> 51:32.380
So it's still coming from the server if there's no peers.

51:32.380 --> 51:33.380
So how does that make any sense?

51:33.380 --> 51:34.380
Yeah.

51:34.380 --> 51:37.780
And it should just grab that HLS files at the end of the day, right?

51:37.780 --> 51:38.780
Yeah.

51:38.780 --> 51:41.860
This feels to me like one of those pieces of mail that gets us trying to figure out

51:41.860 --> 51:46.820
a problem that we didn't know existed because we've had listeners, especially in the mumble

51:46.820 --> 51:50.980
room, who have used Jupiter Tube while we're live for the most part.

51:50.980 --> 51:54.580
And it's not, you know, we've had to add a peer or two, but it's for the most part, I

51:54.580 --> 51:55.580
think working.

51:55.580 --> 51:56.580
Yeah.

51:56.580 --> 52:00.900
So it would be nice to have more people kind of taking us up on the Jupiter Tube peering

52:00.900 --> 52:01.900
stuff.

52:01.900 --> 52:06.820
I understand it's tricky because in some circumstances, YouTube or Twitch just works better or it's

52:06.820 --> 52:08.580
what you have an app for or whatever.

52:08.580 --> 52:15.500
But you know, these self-hosted open source platforms are only as successful as the user

52:15.500 --> 52:16.500
base for them.

52:16.500 --> 52:18.720
And it's like if anybody's going to use them, it's probably going to be us.

52:18.720 --> 52:23.100
So we should try to actually be there to be customers for these things and demonstrate

52:23.100 --> 52:24.460
a demand.

52:24.460 --> 52:26.020
And we could use more people peering.

52:26.020 --> 52:29.700
But the other thing that I think is doable, and maybe somebody out there knows the way,

52:29.700 --> 52:36.140
we've gotten close, is a way to essentially set up our own peers, like maybe a headless

52:36.140 --> 52:41.140
Linode that we deploy somewhere in the world that's just adding a peer over there.

52:41.140 --> 52:45.180
And it's not just as simple as a web torrent.

52:45.180 --> 52:52.100
It is also, so a peer tube, it uses torrents to distribute the HLS files and it uses WebRTC

52:52.100 --> 52:55.000
to communicate something in some data channel.

52:55.000 --> 52:59.820
So you have to have a WebRTC communications channel as well.

52:59.820 --> 53:06.620
And there is an Electron app there that does seeding and does the WebRTC stuff.

53:06.620 --> 53:09.060
You can't run that headless.

53:09.060 --> 53:10.060
Maybe we can.

53:10.060 --> 53:13.820
Anyways, if people out there have tips for us or want to just participate...

53:13.820 --> 53:17.140
But we need to update it with each new live stream too, huh?

53:17.140 --> 53:23.340
Jupyter.tube though, that's our per tube instance where we video stream the recording of our

53:23.340 --> 53:27.500
shows and then we archive them over there for playback if people would like.

53:27.500 --> 53:33.200
Noah also wrote in with a potential Odroid killer, he says, what do you guys think of

53:33.200 --> 53:36.720
this particular single board computer?

53:36.720 --> 53:41.860
As Intel NICs, six serial ATA ports, doesn't quite have RAID support, but might just be

53:41.860 --> 53:43.980
an option for JB.

53:43.980 --> 53:51.180
The N5105 or the N6005 NAS board, it does look really good.

53:51.180 --> 53:56.740
You know what is nice is it's Intel NICs and way more SATA.

53:56.740 --> 53:57.740
Six?

53:57.740 --> 53:58.740
Yeah.

53:58.740 --> 54:00.380
That's pretty sweet.

54:00.380 --> 54:06.200
So the base price is $195 US greenbacks, then it looks like it goes up to about $480 depending

54:06.200 --> 54:07.820
on when you buy it and what you spec it with.

54:07.820 --> 54:13.540
Yeah, you can either get a Celeron N5105 or Pentium N6005.

54:13.540 --> 54:15.500
It's got NVMe.

54:15.500 --> 54:16.500
That looks good.

54:16.500 --> 54:17.500
DDR4.

54:17.500 --> 54:18.500
That looks good.

54:18.500 --> 54:19.500
Lots of SATA.

54:19.500 --> 54:21.300
It's got dual M.2s, looks like.

54:21.300 --> 54:24.580
Man, how many USB ports does this freaking thing have too or whatever?

54:24.580 --> 54:26.620
There's just a ton of ports on this thing.

54:26.620 --> 54:29.460
Yeah, this looks really nice.

54:29.460 --> 54:33.380
This is always the problem, is there's always so many options and this came up with the

54:33.380 --> 54:34.380
Raspberry Pi too.

54:34.380 --> 54:38.080
As soon as you mentioned you got a Raspberry Pi, there's like, oh, have you tried this?

54:38.080 --> 54:41.660
And sometimes it's like there are better ones and this could be a better one.

54:41.660 --> 54:45.500
And then sometimes you want to get behind the one that has a bit of an ecosystem.

54:45.500 --> 54:48.320
Do you have opt case option, what's the form factor?

54:48.320 --> 54:51.500
What do you know about the manufacturer, are they going to stick around?

54:51.500 --> 54:52.500
Yeah.

54:52.500 --> 54:53.500
Yeah.

54:53.500 --> 54:54.500
Ugh.

54:54.500 --> 54:55.500
It's hard.

54:55.500 --> 54:56.500
This is a hard choice to make.

54:56.500 --> 54:59.420
And we're not even done yet because we want to replace a couple machines here in the studio

54:59.420 --> 55:00.420
too.

55:00.420 --> 55:01.420
We don't want big computers.

55:01.420 --> 55:03.420
I think we've got to crowdsource it, right?

55:03.420 --> 55:07.020
People just got to start buying these things and let us know.

55:07.020 --> 55:08.020
Yeah.

55:08.020 --> 55:09.020
Yeah.

55:09.020 --> 55:12.140
We just have people buy a whole bunch of different ones and we can all run the Ferronics test

55:12.140 --> 55:14.780
suite on them, get a big comparison suite going.

55:14.780 --> 55:19.660
Well, I think to add one more to the pile, Matthew also wrote in just about at the same

55:19.660 --> 55:23.780
time and suggested a Nexcom mini PC.

55:23.780 --> 55:28.740
He writes, Chris has been talking about that Odroid on Linux Unplugged and Cellposi quite

55:28.740 --> 55:32.020
a bit, and I wanted to suggest the Nexcom devices.

55:32.020 --> 55:36.860
They're an industrial, mostly fanless x86 platform for a variety of applications.

55:36.860 --> 55:41.260
In particular, I use the Nexcom NDIS device.

55:41.260 --> 55:45.700
It's meant to be a signage player, but I use the device as a fanless application server

55:45.700 --> 55:48.900
running Ubuntu server, and I love the thing.

55:48.900 --> 55:54.820
Mine is an i5 base PC and it's gone as far as testing 4k Plex trans codes and it handles

55:54.820 --> 55:58.340
a couple of the trans codes at the same time without issue.

55:58.340 --> 56:00.220
Praise QuickSync.

56:00.220 --> 56:02.700
The device can be had on eBay relatively cheaply.

56:02.700 --> 56:04.260
You should give them a gander.

56:04.260 --> 56:05.260
All right.

56:05.260 --> 56:06.260
Jeez.

56:06.260 --> 56:07.260
Yeah.

56:07.260 --> 56:09.880
This is the way if you ever want to find out what's really great out there, you buy something,

56:09.880 --> 56:12.700
get really hyped about it, and then you'll discover all the other options.

56:12.700 --> 56:14.180
But some of these are really cool.

56:14.180 --> 56:18.500
I dig the built-in heatsink and the mounts and the DC power.

56:18.500 --> 56:21.260
Oh, man, that's checking a box.

56:21.260 --> 56:23.340
We could just screw that onto the back of you.

56:23.340 --> 56:25.540
I feel like we almost need a tiny PC library.

56:25.540 --> 56:29.740
You can just check one out for a week or two, give it a try.

56:29.740 --> 56:33.820
I am really enjoying the small, low-power PC.

56:33.820 --> 56:35.700
It's one thing to just get a crazy fast...

56:35.700 --> 56:36.700
I mean, that's great.

56:36.700 --> 56:40.260
I absolutely love that too, but there's just something about these that are just enough

56:40.260 --> 56:41.540
machine.

56:41.540 --> 56:45.620
Just enough machine, not drawing too much power, which is another big thing for me.

56:45.620 --> 56:48.740
I feel like there's a big future in playing around with that kind of hardware and seeing

56:48.740 --> 56:50.180
how much Linux you can get.

56:50.180 --> 56:54.980
You're just going to try to fill all of your places with as many tiny little PCs now, aren't

56:54.980 --> 56:55.980
you?

56:55.980 --> 56:56.980
Yeah, man.

56:56.980 --> 56:57.980
Yeah.

56:57.980 --> 57:01.600
I mean, why have big computers when you can have lots of small, little computers?

57:01.600 --> 57:02.600
That's my thinking there, right?

57:02.600 --> 57:03.600
Swarm, swarm.

57:03.600 --> 57:04.600
Booster Graham.

57:04.600 --> 57:05.600
All right.

57:05.600 --> 57:10.300
We got some big old boosts into the show this week that we want to cover.

57:10.300 --> 57:15.260
And then I kind of also want to talk about, just as an aside, this whole FTX situation.

57:15.260 --> 57:22.460
If you're curious what's going on there, why this whole Bitcoin casino crashed around them,

57:22.460 --> 57:26.140
we just published an episode of the Bitcoin Dad Pod.

57:26.140 --> 57:33.320
And you can find that at bitcoindadpod.fireside.fm and it's slash episode 50, so slash 50.

57:33.320 --> 57:35.060
Effective scam tourism.

57:35.060 --> 57:36.900
And we break it all down in plain English.

57:36.900 --> 57:38.500
What's going on there?

57:38.500 --> 57:42.660
Why the price of Bitcoin goes down with it, which is essentially people have to sell to

57:42.660 --> 57:43.660
cover their positions.

57:43.660 --> 57:51.940
It turns out that FTX was sitting on two Bitcoin, so they didn't have a lot of Bitcoin.

57:51.940 --> 57:55.060
They were mostly dealing around with these scam coins.

57:55.060 --> 58:00.140
But if you have questions or you'd just like to know a recap that's just a common sense

58:00.140 --> 58:04.900
recap, go check it out in episode 50 of the Bitcoin Dad Pod.

58:04.900 --> 58:09.620
And then we get to, I think it's going to be Mentat, I think, I don't know if I have

58:09.620 --> 58:12.460
that right, but we're going to go with the Mentat.

58:12.460 --> 58:18.700
And Mentat sends in a row of ducks, 2222.

58:18.700 --> 58:22.600
Since you guys started talking about the shift in podcast advertising, I have noticed several

58:22.600 --> 58:28.300
podcasts and podcast networks I listened to doubling or even tripling up on ads, as well

58:28.300 --> 58:31.540
as starting up membership subscriptions at the same time.

58:31.540 --> 58:33.420
Man, that's rough.

58:33.420 --> 58:35.860
I hope that this goes smoothly.

58:35.860 --> 58:42.420
I've been following the financial news of some of the big podcast sponsors in this space

58:42.420 --> 58:47.300
and they are having a rough time of it, the tech sector in general.

58:47.300 --> 58:51.540
So I think it is, if there's a podcast out there that you really like and you've been

58:51.540 --> 58:55.420
considering joining the membership, it might be time to consider because I think some of

58:55.420 --> 58:58.420
these podcasters are probably panicking.

58:58.420 --> 59:02.540
If I were trying to get a membership program launched right now, I would be in like, you

59:02.540 --> 59:04.020
know, disaster mode.

59:04.020 --> 59:05.460
It'd be really scary.

59:05.460 --> 59:10.020
I'm so grateful for our members because they really, it's like, that's how we know our

59:10.020 --> 59:13.700
ongoing production is covered.

59:13.700 --> 59:17.060
We may have to make big changes, but like the shows will continue.

59:17.060 --> 59:20.220
And that's, you know, the members are like the insurance program for that.

59:20.220 --> 59:23.820
And I'm very, very grateful, especially now.

59:23.820 --> 59:28.580
Marcel boosts in with some enterprise at 1701.

59:28.580 --> 59:32.820
As a one-off during a busy week, I think I actually would listen to a fully AI generated

59:32.820 --> 59:33.820
show.

59:33.820 --> 59:36.620
I think it'd actually be pretty good, but I don't think I'd want it every week.

59:36.620 --> 59:39.700
Well, that'll be if you can tell.

59:39.700 --> 59:41.500
That would be the benchmark, I think.

59:41.500 --> 59:45.580
I think an AI generated show would only make sense for like a holiday show where you're

59:45.580 --> 59:50.580
trying to do essentially like a best of, but from new content generated from the old content.

59:50.580 --> 59:55.520
And you'd have to have like editorial control and it would take so much more work than just

59:55.520 --> 59:56.520
doing a show.

59:56.520 --> 01:00:00.460
Would we be able to generate the whole thing where we have to like sort of edit together

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.100
some of the stuff that did pop out?

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:03.660
Would this part be generated?

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:05.180
How do you have that?

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:07.940
How does the AI know how to give Chris enough sass?

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:08.940
That's finally tuned.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:09.940
Yeah.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:10.940
Yeah.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:11.940
You really got to figure it out.

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:15.180
So, well, it's going to be a couple of years at least.

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:19.980
And then Rusticastroversa came in with a row of ducks.

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:23.140
And just simply says, boost!

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:24.140
B-O-O-S-T.

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:30.380
412 Linux boosts in with 2,048 sets.

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:38.060
Regarding packaging on distributions, Ubuntu MATE enabled Flatpak along with Snaps in 2204.

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:40.860
This has been a fantastic experience for me.

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:44.980
Initially, I found it beneficial to quickly switch Firefox from Snap to Flatpak.

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:50.340
Now I can use whatever packaging system works best for the application I am installing.

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:52.580
The Ubuntu MATE team have made this easy.

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:55.420
It's a really underappreciated feature.

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:56.420
That is nice.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:01.940
Flatpaks on an Ubuntu system out of the box, that's just giving your users what they need

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:02.940
and want.

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:03.940
You got to respect that.

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:04.940
Yeah.

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.140
And then I think to 412's point too, it's like, well, maybe, you know, if you're already

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:10.100
sold on some Snaps, maybe you're doing the next Cloud Snap, whatever, like, you know,

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:14.660
you've got best of all them worlds.

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:18.900
The facial hair boosts in with 6,000 cents.

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:19.900
Boost!

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:23.820
I recall Chris mentioned he got his hands on a popcorn pocket PC.

01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:27.420
I was wondering, what ever happened to it?

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:31.980
Well, we have it in-house and I kind of fire it up from time to time.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.940
I dust off and I play around and see how things are.

01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:39.700
This is one of those things that's tricky to talk about on air because it's got a lot

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:42.660
of promise, but it isn't quite there yet.

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:46.260
There's not a firmware that is really, like, I could just say, hey, go grab this and throw

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:47.260
this firmware.

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:48.260
Right.

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:56.340
And I don't want to come on air and talk negatively about it and sort of undercut any progress.

01:01:56.340 --> 01:02:00.060
But at the same time, there's nothing really to say that's positive yet.

01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:03.100
So I'm kind of in a waiting phase and I have been for a long time.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:06.100
Hasn't found its way actually, like, into your life in a meaningful way yet.

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.100
Yeah.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:12.900
So if you're not familiar with the popcorn computer, it's about the size of a Game Boy,

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:18.620
a little a little wider and it's got a full QWERTY keyboard, LCD screen, some USB-C ports

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:23.340
and yeah, it's supposed to run Linux and you grab a, you know, you grab a video out port

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:26.780
and you could hook it up and now you got a full computer and you disconnect it and you're

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:32.280
just walking around with a little tiny five inch screen kind of a thing.

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:36.840
But so far, so far, I have not really found the firmware that really brings it home.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:37.980
But I'm keeping an eye out there.

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:42.220
So if anybody out there wants an update or you hear something, maybe I missed it, shoot

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:45.940
me a shoot me a boost or shoot me an email or something, let me know and I'll I'll give

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:47.380
it a go again.

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:51.540
Now we got quite a bit of feedback about Mastodon, we got a bunch of boosts in and we also got

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:57.340
a bunch of plus ones via, you know, the old email, Tekov 751 specifically boosted it in

01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:01.580
with a mini row of ducks, 222 sats.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:07.420
I tried to build out a smaller Mastodon server for a small community of 50 or so people.

01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:09.880
Later though, I had to kill it in the beta trial.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:14.820
It was obvious that even if it was really to put hours and automation into place, it

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:17.060
was just going to be too much.

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:20.220
The instance needs a load of resources, mostly for storage.

01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:26.020
And the bigger issue is that massive moderation is required, at least a couple of people with

01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:28.260
good moral compass to make it happen.

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:32.560
Yeah, there's, there's that whole element of having to manage that whenever you run

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.560
a community thing.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:39.420
But I, I was wondering about what it is to run a Mastodon instance on the backend because

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:45.580
my experience with matrix is that the federation aspect actually is quite a bit of traffic.

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:52.980
And if you're, if you're following people across multiple instances, your home server

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:57.680
has to be pulling all of that in and subscribing to that on activity pub, I would imagine.

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:03.380
And so if you have hundreds or thousands of users that are doing that across multiple

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:08.140
servers, the backend has got to be managing all of that.

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:09.740
It's got to be quite the load.

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:11.220
Actually I would think to run a Mastodon server.

01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:12.380
Maybe I'm wrong.

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:17.300
Maybe it's simpler than I'm picturing because I'm basing my experience on matrix, which

01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:22.500
it, this is, this is a pretty big amount of data with matrix, but I, uh, I'd love any

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:25.180
insight people have from running a Mastodon instance.

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:32.980
Not that I'm thinking about doing it or Cinemotev also boosted in with 2048 sats, another plug

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:33.980
for Mastodon.

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:40.100
I never use the JB matrix due to chat and being, having to be there live.

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:45.220
I hang out one to two times a week and when I do, I just never know what's going on.

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:46.220
That's fair.

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:50.740
I hear, I hear a call for that in that same vein for a, you know, a discourse or something.

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.340
A place for offline chatting.

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:53.340
Yeah.

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:54.340
Yeah.

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:58.660
We also got a thousand sats from OP 1984, just a plus one for Mastodon.

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:02.540
Uh, just moved to Pontiacindex.social and already follow Chris there.

01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:04.620
Hey Chris, you have followers already.

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:05.620
That's nice.

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:06.620
How about that?

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:07.620
Oh gosh.

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:11.180
Where he talks about that podcasting 2.0 nonsense.

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:17.480
And another 128 sats from Paul Asteluk who says, can JB set up a social network that

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.900
keeps me social?

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:23.220
So far you're, so far you're batting a thousand with your recommendations.

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:27.020
I'm still on matrix admittedly only in JB general chat.

01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:28.020
Great show as always.

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:29.020
Thank you.

01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:33.420
He also tosses a few sats for, uh, well, Chris, how am I supposed to read this?

01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:34.420
I don't know.

01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:35.420
Jif.

01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:41.220
Yeah, but isn't that supposed to be a vote for how to, it's supposed to be a vote for

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:43.300
how to say it, but it just is written.

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:47.740
So I don't know how anybody's, how is, you know, I don't know how anybody's supposed

01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:48.740
to know.

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:49.740
Cause when you're reading it, it's hard to tell.

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:52.900
This is part of the problem with the whole, the whole Jif gift thing.

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:55.980
Maybe this is a meta vote for a better name.

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.400
I mean, I don't know how anybody's going to beat Wise Papa John.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:05.460
He put 40,000 sats behind a hard G. So somebody's, I mean, until somebody surpasses that, then

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:07.660
officially on the show, it has a hard G and that's how it is.

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:08.660
Yeah.

01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:09.660
Boost decided, I guess.

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:10.660
Awesome.

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:18.140
Matt wrote in with 69, 69 sats as a boost, I haven't really used Macedon, but I've used

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.140
Pleroma.

01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:21.140
Have you guys used Pleroma?

01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:23.540
I haven't even heard of it actually.

01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:24.540
Heard of it?

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.660
A lightweight Fediverse server.

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:27.660
Never used it.

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:32.940
I've actually kind of heard disparaging things about it, but whenever a technology gets cast

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:36.060
in one way or another, I always think, well, is it the technology or is it the people or

01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:38.180
is it just marketing?

01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:41.660
But it looks like a leaner, lighter Mastodon essentially.

01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:47.420
Let's you participate in the Fediverse, but just as a little cleaner, maybe, maybe simpler

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.060
to implement on the back end as well.

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:51.300
Maybe a little more suited for a smaller group.

01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:56.540
Tire boosts in with 2,023 sats, a little future boost.

01:06:56.540 --> 01:07:01.780
I predict that JB will start its own Mastodon server in 2023.

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:02.780
I'm calling it.

01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:04.140
I know how Chris thinks.

01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:05.780
The seed has been planted.

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:09.020
Hey, that's our first 2023 boost.

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:10.020
Nice.

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:11.020
Nice.

01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:12.020
All right.

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:13.020
Future prediction there.

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:15.980
So a Mastodon instance in 2023.

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:34.660
Viridian boosts in with another 1,701 Satoshis.

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:36.380
I assume it's in reference to Viridian 3.

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:39.100
I mean, it must be, right?

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:44.060
Your discussion about signal was poignant, as I've been eyeing alternatives.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:49.940
The lack of support for CarPlay, backups, and HTTP proxies, along with the devs' attitude,

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:51.980
make it abrasive.

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:57.100
WhatsApp solves all of these issues, but meta.

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:59.780
I hadn't considered switching the family to Matrix.

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:03.740
Intriguing, but as far as I know, no clients support CarPlay.

01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:07.980
I'm also concerned about not being able to move accounts between home servers.

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:08.980
Any suggestions?

01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:13.220
Otherwise, I'll just keep waiting for the one chat app.

01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:14.220
For the one.

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:16.220
I've been giving more thought to the Matrix one.

01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:21.940
I've been really kind of considering if I were to move the whole family to another chat

01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:25.260
platform.

01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:30.300
My first thought actually was, maybe I'll just stand up an XMPP server.

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:34.040
And that feels like a great idea until you think, yeah, but all the clients, they're

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.300
not really as featureful now.

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:40.860
And then that's a real challenge because I think your family now expects stickers and

01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:44.980
emoji reactions and all that stuff.

01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:50.220
And while Matrix doesn't have all of the things that those apps do, it adds more stuff that

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:52.180
people expect in a feature set.

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:57.020
So I think that's another plus one for moving this family to a private Matrix instance.

01:08:57.020 --> 01:09:01.740
I think the question just becomes, which app?

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:02.740
Which front end?

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:06.100
And that might take a little experimentation.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.700
Dreams Void boosts in the row of duck.

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:13.660
I'm a duck, D-U-K, duck, loaded with talent.

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:14.660
Something profound.

01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:18.500
I'm finally caught up with luck now.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:25.100
On to Office Hours episode 9, South Posted episode 81, and LAN episode 259.

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:26.100
That's nice.

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:27.100
Nice.

01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:28.100
I wondered, were you on a road trip?

01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:29.100
Yeah.

01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.100
Did you go through a tear?

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:31.100
What happened?

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.100
What happened?

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:33.100
Got all caught up.

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:34.100
Been out for a while?

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:35.100
It's nice.

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:36.100
Welcome.

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:37.100
Couldn't sleep at night.

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.100
Nice to have you here.

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.100
Whatever the reason, keep it up.

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:44.260
We're just in with 3,141 sats.

01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:48.540
Well as the influencer that inspired me to buy my own Raspberry Pi, I'm saddened to hear

01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:49.540
you've moved on.

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:52.860
I'm also saddened that I now have a new toy that I desire.

01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:54.940
Yeah, we're all feeling that.

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:55.940
Don't worry.

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:56.940
Feel free to ship me all your unused pies.

01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:01.860
I'll throw them in my Micro K8s cluster.

01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:05.020
You know, I wonder, I'm not really, I guess I actually do have a couple that are not currently

01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:08.380
in use, but I don't imagine I'll stop using the Raspberry Pis.

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:12.780
I just don't know if I'm going to buy any more Pi 4s, although I did hear some rumors

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:16.660
that there's some new Pi hardware we're going to get teased with.

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:23.380
You know, for me, if they didn't have a huge increase in CPU performance on the Pi, if

01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:27.220
they just had a moderate CPU increase and a moderate memory increase, but had a big

01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:33.620
increase on storage in terms of IO, not size, I think that would put the Pi in contender

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:34.620
category again.

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:36.860
I mean, it's nice being on x86 again.

01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:39.460
There is that whole element as well.

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:40.460
But we'll see.

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:41.460
We'll see.

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:42.580
Maybe we'll get a tease.

01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:46.060
Soham boosted in live last week with a row of ducks.

01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:47.060
Thank you kindly.

01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:48.060
And it was a live boost.

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.060
So that's pretty neat.

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:52.580
But what is even more rad about it is he used Boost CLI.

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:54.900
You delightful nerd.

01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:56.260
That's pretty awesome.

01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:59.180
And he says Nix is the greatest package manager ever created.

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:00.180
That may be true.

01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:02.180
We will have to have someone confirm that.

01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:03.340
We'll put somebody on that.

01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:04.700
Truly there's research going on.

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:10.900
And then our last boost this week came in from JPC, who sent us a row of Grandpa Ducks

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:13.580
22,222 SATs.

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:15.260
This old duck still got it.

01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:17.940
He says he loves the show and he's also using Boost CLI.

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.940
Well, well done JPC.

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:21.800
Thank you everyone for the support.

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.060
We really appreciate it.

01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:24.060
We still love the SATs.

01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.540
SATs are SATs to us.

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:29.340
So grab a handful on the cheap using something like Strike or the Cash App.

01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:32.740
If you're outside the US, Blue Wallet.

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:35.700
I really like RoboSats too if you want to get really geeky, but then you got to have

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:36.700
Tor Browser.

01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:41.220
I'm imagining if we had like a fancy like downtown SF, JB office or whatever, we could

01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:44.100
have like a little Boost CLI terminal set up and ready to go.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:46.140
It's got like retro term on there, right?

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:50.100
Like you're just, oh man, try your first boost.

01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:51.980
Retro term or just a really old CRT.

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:52.980
Yeah.

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:56.820
Could go, you know, go clacky IBM PS2 keyboard as well.

01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.500
Someday with enough boosts we'll get there.

01:11:58.500 --> 01:11:59.780
That would be pretty neat.

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:00.780
That would be.

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:01.780
Yes.

01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:04.220
We got some boost into the show, newpodcastapps.com.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:07.140
That's where you go to upgrade to a podcasting 2.0 app.

01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:10.900
We got more in the works there too, as far as podcasting 2.0 features.

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:15.300
So go check out Office Hours 16, where we talk about some of that stuff we'll be working

01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.300
on.

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:18.700
Also just a random shout out because we got some boost in that we don't make it on the

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:22.340
show, but we still just wanted to pick a handful to say thank you and thank you everybody else

01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:26.500
if we didn't call out your name or read your message, we still got it and we really appreciate

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:27.980
your support.

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:30.140
I wanted to do this one because let's see if I got this right.

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:32.900
Let me know if I got your name right.

01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:40.540
One thousand sats from Firghazballs, something like that.

01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:43.660
Is this deep fake, Chris?

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:49.100
We got a hundred sats from TheBooch asking about our thoughts on signal adding stories,

01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:52.300
which is actually Office Hours as well as that.

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.940
So go check out Office Hours 16 for that, TheBooch.

01:12:54.940 --> 01:13:00.340
And then Oppie1984 says that it's GIF, GIF is peanut butter.

01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:02.940
Well you're gonna have to send in more than a hundred and sats, buddy.

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:06.380
And then NachoLinux sent a row of sticks.

01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:10.380
He says I cranked through my Fountain FM subscriptions to earn some sats so I could boost in.

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:11.620
Oh, thank you.

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:12.620
That's very awesome.

01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:14.420
Thank you everybody.

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:17.060
And we appreciate the members out there too who support the show.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:21.540
They invest in our ongoing production, UnpluggedCore.com if you want to become a member of this show

01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:23.620
or Jupiter.party if you want all the shows.

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:25.940
And as a thank you, we give it to you ad-free.

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:29.020
And we also package up the live stream and we make it available to you.

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:31.180
We put lots of extra content in there.

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:32.180
Sometimes too much.

01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:39.100
Jeff, who went out on location to, you know, look at the Folsom Geocache, specifically

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:41.180
left the live show, The Mumble Room, today.

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:44.780
So that way he could listen to the live stream while he's road tripping.

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:45.780
That's a thing.

01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:49.420
At the meetups, some of the listeners that drove quite a ways to make it to the meetups

01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:51.420
were like, yeah, I just listened to the live version on the way up here.

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:53.220
It kills like, you know, a few hours.

01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.580
Sometimes it is that long.

01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:58.420
You know, there's only so much content in a week and the more the better.

01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:00.020
Yeah, it's pretty wild.

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:03.700
Links to what we talked about today and all that kind of stuff are over at LinuxUnplugged.com

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:04.700
slash 484.

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:06.700
Is that where we're at?

01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:07.700
484.

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:08.700
You heard our Mumble Room.

01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:09.700
We got a Mumble Room.

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:10.860
It's over there if you'd like to join it.

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:14.020
It's a great way to listen in real time or participate in the show if something strikes

01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:15.020
your fancy.

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:18.460
We have details for that at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:19.460
Find the Mumble stuff.

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:20.460
It's a slash mumble.

01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:22.020
Same with the Matrix details.

01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:26.700
And yeah, shout out to our buddy Carl George who got the latest and greatest mumble packaged

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:28.220
up in Fedora 37.

01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:31.420
So you know, PipeWire, mumble, it's a great setup to join the show.

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.420
All I'm saying.

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:33.420
Yep.

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:37.140
If you're going to upgrade, might as well upgrade in style and go mumble with PipeWire.

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.140
You know what else?

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:42.740
Speaking of adding PipeWire support, as we record today, a new version of MPV is out

01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:44.780
that has a PipeWire back in too.

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:45.780
Mm-hmm.

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:47.260
Loving that MPV.

01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:51.780
I'm glad we gave it a mention today because we just don't talk about it enough.

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:55.060
And then last but not least, if you're not doing anything on your Sunday and you want

01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:59.260
to hang out with your Linux buddies, head over to Jupiter.tube around noon Pacific three

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:00.260
p.m.

01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:03.560
Eastern and, you know, watch the show.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:07.700
We stream it live over there and you can see how handsome Brent is.

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:08.700
See how we make the sausage.

01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:10.540
Here are all our mistakes.

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.180
Noon Pacific three p.m.

01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:13.180
Eastern Jupiter.tube.

01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:15.180
See you next week.

01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:16.460
Same bad time.

01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:17.460
Same bad station.

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:19.180
All right, gentlemen.

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:20.180
Did we do it?

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:21.180
Is that it?

01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:22.180
I don't know if any of us are.

01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:24.980
I don't know if any of us are sticking with Fedora 37 after this.

01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:26.380
I don't think I am.

01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:29.220
I might give Fedora 36 a go.

01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:31.860
Yeah, I got to go fix Fedora 36.

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:32.860
Right?

01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:34.340
I'm going to see how long it sticks.

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:35.980
I'm not going to get rid of it like.

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:36.980
Yeah.

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:37.980
Right away.

01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:38.980
We'll see.

01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:39.980
We'll see.

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:40.980
We'll see.

01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:41.980
I am really enjoying this gnome.

01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:42.980
So it is nice.

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:45.560
They are doing great.

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:46.560
Don't miss Linux Action News.

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:49.380
There's more at LinuxActionNews.com.

01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:52.620
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:15:52.620 --> 01:16:20.780
And we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:33.940
Minimac, you had a question, though, during the deepfake.

01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:37.460
Yeah, I want to learn something today.

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:40.660
So the idea is, how does it work?

01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:43.540
I try to imagine how it works.

01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:48.640
Like you have a lot of episodes and then first you have to define the voice patterns.

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.940
So this is Chris, this is Brent, this is Wes.

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:57.900
Once the AI has recognized these voice patterns, you can probably pass other love episodes

01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:01.700
and just let them separate the voice strings.

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:06.900
I would think it's more like he has to cut me out and just only supply it with my cuts.

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:10.340
So maybe we will have an answer afterwards.

01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:19.340
Then I would probably you will have to pass a voice to text pattern to have a text database

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:25.300
with the words, like on the bottom you have a database with like 50 is and if the home

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:31.660
and I don't know what, then probably if that is possible, I will try to level that thing

01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:35.780
so that the is is always like the same kind.

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:42.380
And once you have like if you have 50 times the same words so that that AI engine could

01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:50.500
level it so it would define Chris normally uses the bird home like this and then once

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:56.340
you have it leveled, then you can start to make some sentences.

01:17:56.340 --> 01:18:02.140
Well I use the tool, it's actually developed originally by Mozilla.

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:10.700
It's called Koki, C-O-Q-U-I and the way it works actually is you you feed it lots of

01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:16.100
samples, generally between one second and up to 10 seconds.

01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:19.140
That really depends on your training hardware.

01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:23.740
I have a RTX Titan that I use for training.

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:30.700
And so with 24 gigs, you kind of top out at about 10 seconds with what did I use batch

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:39.180
size of I believe I use 48 samples per batch and what you do is you you get as many samples

01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:42.980
as you can and what I did was a very painstaking process.

01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:50.660
I went through a whole bunch of episodes including LUP, Coder and SSH and I manually went and

01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:54.260
found clips of Chris speaking.

01:18:54.260 --> 01:19:03.180
I got about 48 minutes worth, broke it up into various clips, then I ran a speech to

01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:11.860
text parser over all of it, then I re-listened to everything just to ensure that the transcoded

01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:20.220
text is correct and then that gets fed into the AI trainer and then as it goes along it

01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:26.780
spits out the model after various steps and then you use that model to then you just feed

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:29.680
it a line of text to work out.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:36.580
The problem is I just did not have the time or patience to get any more audio.

01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:37.580
Already a lot.

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:39.980
48 minutes is way too low.

01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:41.760
You need minimum 2-3 hours.

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:46.060
Some of the larger data sets that actually are used to build these text-to-speech models

01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:49.780
are in the range of 20 plus hours worth.

01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:56.820
So if I had the time and I went through all of the back catalogue of the shows of Chris

01:19:56.820 --> 01:20:02.780
talking I could probably build a very comprehensible model.

01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:04.420
I would not wish that on anyone.

01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:05.420
Don't do that.

01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:06.420
A JB intern.

01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:15.860
So if you had some snippets of Chris reading some text, like some pages of text, it would

01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:16.860
be much easier.

01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:25.420
Right now you have to really cut the speech pieces of Chris from the show and feed it

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:26.420
manually.

01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:29.100
Yeah, exactly.

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:33.060
I think really you just need a few topics that Chris can rant about on his soapbox and

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:35.860
then you've got enough content right there.

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:41.140
It's a great point because you actually need a variety of phenoms, I think is that the

01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:42.420
right word?

01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:46.080
Basically the individual parts of words.

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:52.620
You need a large range of that for the AI to be able to learn how the individual speaker

01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:54.740
says that to then be able to reproduce it.

01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:59.220
Yeah, if you don't have enough variability in the base set.

01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:04.280
In the clip I generated, I didn't write one million sats, I wrote 900,000 sats because

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:10.520
none of the clips I had pulled out had Chris saying the word million.

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:15.100
So whenever I tried actually doing a million in the generated speech, it just sounded kind

01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:16.100
of garbled.

01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:17.100
It didn't actually make sense.

01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:18.100
Very interesting.

01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:20.100
Thank you for the information.

01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:25.780
And to actually just put a finer point on it, if you've seen the show Kenobi, the voice

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:30.340
of Darth Vader was not actually voiced by James Earl Jones.

01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:33.060
That was actually the same thing.

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:39.540
It was an AI generated model that they had built from James Earl Jones's voice.

01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:44.500
And I don't know if you've seen the news, but he has signed basically, I'm not sure

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:49.620
what it's called, but basically a perpetual permission for Disney to now use his likeness,

01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:52.020
his voice for Darth Vader going forward.

01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:56.780
So going forward, any appearances of Darth Vader are going to be AI generated voices,

01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:59.220
not James Earl himself recording it.

01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:03.420
Yeah, I've read an article about that.

01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:08.240
You know, CB, it strikes me too that like, say we were serious about ever doing something

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:09.500
like this.

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:15.740
One thing that if you were working with JB, like we have stems of just my track to a degree,

01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:20.220
we don't have like a lot of them, but we have probably weeks worth of just my track in the

01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:23.360
episodes too, which would probably make it easier, I would think to sample from, because

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:27.240
then you could just drop the silences and essentially just have...

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:33.620
It would be incredibly easier if someone had just handed me these pristine audio files

01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:35.380
with nothing else mixed in.

01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:42.300
Because I had to cut past some of the other speakers and over speaking and someone using

01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:46.860
the soundboard, yeah, soundboard mixed in, yeah, that's absolutely true.

01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:47.860
Absolutely.

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:53.900
Would the Mozilla organization feed some example text that makes it easier?

01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:58.220
Because if they're working on that, it would be also cool if they hand out some example

01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:06.140
text that someone could read and somehow you get really a good sample of the voice.

01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:08.580
Like a script that helps train it a little bit.

01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:09.820
That's true too.

01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:10.820
That's true too.

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:19.860
But for example, even doing some of the visual deepfakes, so deepfaking a person's face,

01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:26.220
if you're trying to get, trying to do it of a celebrity, for whatever reason, it's harder

01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:33.220
to find all the different angles and the different movements of the mouth and the expressions.

01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:37.580
However, if you're doing it yourself, you want to deepfake yourself or you're doing

01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:43.820
it for a movie or whatever, you basically stand somebody in front of a camera and you

01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:47.600
have them, I don't know what they're called, but there is these phrases that you can say

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:52.500
that force the speaker to move their mouth in a particular pattern.

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.860
And to capture that.

01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:55.860
Exactly.

01:23:55.860 --> 01:24:00.220
And the same thing with doing the audio.

01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:05.380
If you had a script, you have a variety of words, something that forces the voice to

01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:11.260
do the expressions and the different ranges that you would normally say in regular conversation.

01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:12.660
Now read it again as a prospector.

01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:13.660
Yeah.

01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:14.660
Yeah.

01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:15.660
Give me the prospector voice.

01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:16.660
Yeah.

01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:18.060
You got to get all the different iterations and you got to make sure you capture all of

01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:23.580
the terms that we use a lot, ZFS, Linux, you know, that kind of stuff.

01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:25.380
It actually did pretty well with all that stuff.

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:26.380
Did it?

01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:28.020
I was going to ask you, how does it handle those kinds of terms?

01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:31.740
Is it just, is it just because I say it and so it just learns it?

01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:35.740
Well, yes, because you say it, but also because when it does the learning, it doesn't learn

01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:36.740
individual words.

01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:39.460
It learns the little, the parts of the words, right?

01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:45.380
So you say ZFS or zebra, you still have that sound in there that it's going to learn and

01:24:45.380 --> 01:25:02.660
then piece it together.
